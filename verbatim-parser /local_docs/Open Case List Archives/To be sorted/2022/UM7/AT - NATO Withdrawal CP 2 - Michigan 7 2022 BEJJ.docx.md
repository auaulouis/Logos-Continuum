"NATO Security Dependents Are Not Useful Allies" 01/08/2022
https://www.cato.org/commentary/nato-security-dependents-are-not-useful-allies//ekc

Since the end of World War II, [U.S. **officials** have had an
**unduly** expansive concept]{.underline} of what constitutes worthwhile
strategic allies for the United States[. In too many cases, the
"**allies**" that Washington touts are small, weak, often **militarily
useless** dependents]{.underline}. Worse, some of them are on bad terms
with more powerful neighboring states. Under those circumstances, the
so‐​called [allies are **major liabilities** rather than assets to the
United States.]{.underline} Indeed, they are potential snares, ones that
can entangle America in unnecessary military confrontations.

Washington would do well to become far more selective about which
nations it includes in its roster of allies, [and U.S. leaders should
**stop elevating security** dependents to the status of
allies.]{.underline} [When]{.underline} U.S. officials described the
regimes that [Washington installed through military force in Afghanistan
and Iraq as allies,]{.underline} it became clear that [they had lost
even minimal **understanding**]{.underline} of the concept. That point
became abundantly evident when their Afghan client collapsed almost
overnight in the face of the Taliban military offensive[. It's time for
U.S. policymakers **to do better.**]{.underline}

[TROUBLING PROMISCUITY about acquiring weak U.S. security partners was
evident even during]{.underline} the Cold War, and [the tendency has
become even more pronounced in the post‐​Cold War era.]{.underline} As
the fiasco in Afghanistan (and its ugly predecessor in South Vietnam)
confirmed, that problem with U.S. foreign policy has existed in multiple
regions. However, the defect has [become **most acute with** respect to
Washington's campaign to **expand NATO into Eastern
Europe**]{.underline}. Since the mid‐​1990s, U.S. administrations have
worked to add a menagerie of new NATO members, [and it has done so with
even less selectivity and good judgment than some people use to acquire
Facebook friends.]{.underline}

[Many of America's so‐​called **allies** are **major** **liabilities**
rather than assets to U.S. foreign policy.]{.underline} Indeed, they are
potential snares[, ones that can entangle America in unnecessary
military confrontations.]{.underline}

Many of those [new members have **very little to offer** to the United
States as security partners]{.underline}. Indeed, some are mini‐​states,
bordering on being micro‐​states. [Such lightly armed Lilliputians would
add little or **nothing** to Washington's own capabilities---especially
in a showdown with another major power.]{.underline}

[As **economic** **assets**, their importance is decidedly **limited**,
and **militarily**, they are even **less valuable.** It's hard to see
how new NATO allies such as Albania, Slovenia, Montenegro, and North
Macedonia **enhance** America's **power** and security]{.underline}.
That point should be apparent based on size of population alone.
Albania's 2.87 million, North Macedonia's 2.1 million, and Slovenia's
2.07 million people put those countries squarely in the mini‐​state
category, while Montenegro's 628,000 barely deserves even that label. It
doesn't get much better with respect to [either annual gross domestic
product or size of military force]{.underline}s. Even Slovenia's \$52.8
billion GDP puts that country only eighty‐​sixth in the global rankings.
Albania's \$15.2 billion (125th), North Macedonia's \$12.26 billion
(135th) and Montenegro's \$4.78 billion (159th) [are even less
impressive.]{.underline}

[The military forces that our new NATO allies can field are not likely
to strike fear into Russia or any other would‐​be aggressor]{.underline}.
Albania's armed forces consist of 8,500 active‐​duty personnel,
Slovenia's consist of 8,500, and North Macedonia has 9,000 available.
Montenegro's active‐​duty force totals 2,400. In comparison, the Austin,
Texas, police department has 2,422 people in its ranks.

Granted, the Cold War edition of NATO also had some mini‐​states as
members, most notably Luxembourg and Iceland. However, those members
were located within a stable, democratic Western Europe. Their defense
also was geographically inseparable from Washington's mission of
protecting important military and economic players, such as West
Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Great Britain, from what appeared to
be a totalitarian superpower with expansionist ambitions. That situation
was qualitatively different from Washington's gratuitous post‐​Cold War
decision to manage the security of quarrelsome mini‐​states in the
chronically volatile Balkans. Since the mid‐​1990s, the United States has
entangled itself in the region's parochial spats, but giving some of the
countries NATO membership intensified America's exposure to needless
risks and burdens.

THE RISK-BENEFIT calculation is even worse with respect to some of the
other small nations that have joined NATO in the post‐​Cold War era.
[Those **partners** are not merely **irrelevant** from the standpoint of
U.S. security; they are **potential**ly dangerous **tripwires** that
could trigger a conflict between the United States and a nuclear‐​armed
Russia.]{.underline}

That point underscores one very important difference between individuals
casually amassing Facebook friends and the United States promiscuously
adding new security mendicants. [Facebook friends do not have the
ability to entangle anyone in armed conflicts]{.underline};
irresponsible security dependents definitely can do so. Indeed, [there
are multiple examples throughout history of such clients snaring their
patrons into devastating, unnecessary wars]{.underline}. One notable
example was how Tsarist Russia's fateful decision to give strong backing
to Serbia in the latter's escalating quarrel with Austria‐​Hungary
following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand helped ignite
World War I---and caused the utter ruin of the Russian empire.\]

[The United States is **flirting** **with** a similar **danger** today
regarding its small clients in Eastern Europe]{.underline}. President
George W[. Bush's decision to support the NATO membership]{.underline}
[bids of the three Baltic republics was---and remains---highly
provocative to Russia]{.underline}. One crucial way to reduce the danger
of armed clashes between great powers is to show mutual respect for
respective spheres of influence[. Washington has repeatedly violated
that principle by **pushing** **NATO** to **expand** right up to
Russia's border.]{.underline}

The [addition of the Baltic republics in 2004 was the most dangerous
step in that process]{.underline}. As in the case of the subsequent
addition of the small Balkan nations to NATO, [the three Baltic
countries have **little to offer** in terms of military
capabilitie]{.underline}s. Estonia's 6,700 troops, Latvia's 5,500, and
even Lithuania's 20,500 [wouldn't be much of a factor if **war** broke
out between NATO and Russia.]{.underline}

However, [the drawbacks of making the Baltic republics U.S. security
dependents go far beyond their irrelevance as military
players]{.underline}. Those [three countries]{.underline} were once part
of both Tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union, and [substantial ethnic
Russian minorities still live in both Estonia and Latvia.]{.underline}
The Kremlin has complained on numerous occasions since the Baltic
republics became independent at the end of 1991 that the Russian
population suffers discrimination and other mistreatment. Indeed, that
allegation emerged long before Russian president Vladimir Putin became
Russia's leader[. **Relations** between the Kremlin and its former
territories **remain tense** because of that issue.]{.underline}

Perhaps even more troubling, [Washington's Baltic allies now are feuding
with Moscow's principal client in the region, Belarus]{.underline}. In
the summer and autumn of 2021, Latvia and Lithuania (along with the
European Union) accused Belarus of trying to use a flood of Middle East
refugees as a form of "hybrid warfare." The Lithuanian government even
told its border guards to use force if necessary to prevent the
continued entry of the migrants. A short time later, [Latvia imposed a
state of emergency to deal with the same issu]{.underline}e. A few weeks
earlier, Lithuania had augmented its border barrier by erecting a fence
with razor wire. Latvia soon followed suit. A new round of large‐​scale,
Russia‐​[Belarus military exercises (held every four years) in September
made tensions even more acute.]{.underline}

By virtue of both size and location, [the Baltic republics are not
credible strategic assets for the United States. Indeed, they would be
virtually helpless if Russia made a military move against
them.]{.underline} A 2016 RAND Corporation study concluded that [a
Russian offensive would overrun their defenses in approximately three
days.]{.underline} Such [countries are not U.S. "allies" in any
meaningful sense; they are vulnerable dependents that could trigger a
war between NATO (primarily the United States) and Russia.]{.underline}

**[Washington's]{.underline}** patron‐​client [**relationship** with the
Baltic republics **is risky**,]{.underline} and [U.S. leaders were
unwise to push for their inclusion in NATO.]{.underline} However,
beginning with George W. Bush's administration, [officials have engaged
in even more reckless conduct regarding possible alliance membership for
two other countries, Georgia and Ukraine]{.underline}. They have done
[so despite repeated warnings from the Kremlin]{.underline} that making
either country (especially Ukraine) a NATO member would cross a red line
that Moscow cannot tolerate.

[BUSH CONDUCTED a veritable geopolitical love affair]{.underline} with
both Georgia and Ukraine, portraying them as models for emerging
democracies and repeatedly referring to them as U.S. allies in the most
glowing terms. [Only firm French and German opposition thwarted Bush's
lobbying effort]{.underline} to get NATO to grant Tbilisi and Kiev
membership. Berlin and Paris were troubled by evidence of endemic
political and economic corruption in both countries, but they were even
more worried that further NATO expansion would create a crisis with
Moscow. Their continued opposition has thus far prevented the addition
of Georgia and Ukraine to NATO's ranks, even as the alliance added
multiple Balkan mini‐​states.

However, [U.S. actions have increasingly made the issue of formal
membership a distinction without a difference,]{.underline} and the
outcomes indicate that even unwise informal security relations with
client states can cause serious trouble. Bush encouraged Georgia to take
a firmer stance against the continued presence of Russian "peacekeeping
troops" in two breakaway regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. [In
addition, the United States was busily equipping and training Georgian
military forces.]{.underline} Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili,
apparently read too much into Washington's expressions of support. In
August 2008, his forces launched an attack on Russian units in South
Ossetia, and Moscow responded with a full‐​scale offensive that soon
overran much of Georgia. When Saakashvili begged for U.S. and NATO help
to repel the Russian "aggression," [Bush expressed firm support for
Georgia's sovereignty, but he also indicated that U.S. troops would not
be coming to Tbilisi's rescue]{.underline}. A U.S. client had [tried to
create a military confrontation between NATO and Russia for its own
parochial goal]{.underline}s, but it had misread Washington's signals.
[**Clumsy U.S. policy**, though, was at least partly **responsible**
**for** that **danger**ous episode.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, the actions of subsequent foreign policy teams with
respect to Georgia, and even more so with respect to Ukraine, [indicate
that U.S. leaders learned nothing from the mistakes in 2008. Officials
in both the Trump and Biden administrations have treated Kiev as a de
facto NATO member and a crucial U.S. military ally]{.underline}. Trump's
administration approved multiple weapons shipments to Kiev, sales that
included Javelin anti‐​tank missiles that Russia considers especially
destabilizing[. Such transactions have continued since Joe Biden entered
the White House.]{.underline}

Worse, [Washington's security relationship with Kiev goes far beyond
arms sales]{.underline}. Over the past five years[, U.S. forces have
conducted multiple joint exercises]{.underline} (war games) [with
Ukrainian units.]{.underline} Washington also has [successfully pressed
NATO to include Ukraine in the alliance's war games.]{.underline}
Indeed, Ukraine hosted and led the latest version, Rapid Trident 21. [It
is no secret that such exercises are directed against
Russia.]{.underline} In early April 2021, Biden assured Ukraine's
president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy of [Washington's"unwavering support for
Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia's
ongoing aggression."]{.underline}

[Such a pledge **places** the **U**nited **S**tates in a very dangerous
situation]{.underline}. Kiev seeks to regain Crimea, which Russia
annexed following U.S. and European Union backing for demonstrators who
overthrew Ukraine's elected, pro‐​Russian president in 2014. Indeed,
Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials have expressed that intention
repeatedly and in diverse settings. Kiev's behavior also has become
disturbingly bellicose. In early April 2021, both the Zelenskyy
government and NATO complained loudly when Russia moved some 80,000
troops and heavy weaponry closer to Crimea and other areas along the
border with Ukraine. What they did not mention, and most Western press
accounts also ignored, was that Kiev had previously executed its own
military buildup, amid statements of a determination to regain Crimea.
In any case, an extremely tense confrontation between NATO and Russia
ensued, which was not resolved until Russia pulled back its forces in
late April.

Given the size of its territory and population, Ukraine is not in the
same category as the Balkan and Baltic mini‐​states or Georgia. However,
it has an even greater potential to entangle the United States and the
rest of NATO in a perilous war. The April 2021 episode was a classic
case of a security client behaving in ways that could trigger an armed
conflict. For all of Kiev's boasts about regaining Crimea, the outcome
of a military clash between Russia and Ukraine would be a foregone
conclusion. Ukraine would have no chance of prevailing without massive
outside assistance. Even disregarding the crucial difference that Russia
possesses a strategic and tactical nuclear arsenal, while Ukraine does
not, Russia's advantages in conventional forces are massive. Legislation
that the Ukrainian parliament approved in July 2021 will increase Kiev's
armed forces to 261,000, but Russia fields more than 1 million
active‐​duty personnel. Moreover, although U.S. aid has improved the
quality of the hardware available to Ukraine, Russia's troops are
equipped with some of the most sophisticated weapons in the world.

[U.S. leaders should be deeply concerned when a security dependent
suffering f]{.underline}rom such quantitative and qualitative
disadvantages makes empty boasts about retaking lost territory. It is
[even more worrisome when that client engages in provocative military
gestures]{.underline} toward its powerful neighbor. That is precisely
the way that a rogue [dependent can entangle its great power protector
in a disastrous war.]{.underline} U.S. leaders should want no part of
such a risky patron‐​client relationship.

[THE TEST of whether a specific country is a worthwhile U.S. ally or a
useless, perhaps dangerous, dependent should not be terribly
difficu]{.underline}lt. A key question that must be asked is: [Does that
country substantially add to America's own economic and military
capabilities without creating significant new dangers or
vulnerabilities?]{.underline} [Only if that question can be answered
with an unequivocal "yes," should the country be considered a beneficial
ally]{.underline}. Otherwise, it is either a useless or (even worse) a
dangerous security client. U.S. leaders badly need to learn the
difference. [As a result of NATO's expanded membership and mission, the
United States has acquired a worrisome number of both
types.]{.underline}

#### Even with US military personnel, deterring regional insecurity in the Baltics isn't possible.

[Nowhere is the credibility of the United States and its allies at
**greater risk than in the Baltic Sea** region.]{.underline}
[NATO's [Article
5](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm) pledges
the alliance to defend its members. Doing that for the Baltic states of
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania---three thinly **populated states
squeezed between Russia**, Belarus, and the Baltic Sea---is
hard]{.underline}. Years of cost-cutting, timidity, and wishful thinking
by NATO governments make it harder.

As the Russian military buildup around Ukraine raises fears of a broader
East-West security crisis, NATO allies are hastening to bolster the
Baltic states' defenses while non-NATO members [Sweden and
Finland](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/01/05/finland-sweden-nato-russia-putin/) are
tightening their ties with the alliance. [In late January, U.S. Air
**Force F-15
fighters** [arrived](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-nato-military-moves-send-message-russia-ukraine/story?id=82462943) in
Estonia as part of a wide-ranging reassurance effort. At bases elsewhere
in **Europe and the** **United States, 8,500 U.S. military personnel**
are on heightened alert, ready to deploy to the region as part of NATO's
40,000-strong Response Force.]{.underline}

[These moves, though desirable, are **belated and insufficient**.
Regional security in the Baltic Sea has been a **problem for much
longer** than the **current standoff** with Russia.]{.underline} Solving
this requires more than a one-off, reactive deployment. With Ben Hodges,
a former U.S. Army commander in Europe and now my colleague at the
Center for European Policy Analysis, I have spent the past year deep in
the weeds, looking at the problems of Baltic Sea regional security and
how to fix them.

### 2NC -- ! -- Baltics

#### The Baltic states cannot provide the US a beneficial geopolitical relationship---the security commitments of NATO have grown to an extent where [withdrawal for the US]{.underline} is the most strategically valuable 

Matthew **Mai, 21;** 07/19/2021, B.S. in Public Policy from Rutgers
University, Marcellus Policy Fellow at the John Quincy Adams Society,
and Associate Editor at the Nation Interest; "The Baltic States: Assets
or Liabilities?"
https://realistreview.org/2021/07/19/the-baltic-states-assets-or-liabilities//ekc

President [Biden has pledged to put America "back at the head of the
table]{.underline}" by restoring confidence [in the NATO
alliance]{.underline}. Yet, [regardless of the current
attitude]{.underline} in the White House, the [United States' defense
commitments]{.underline} to countries on the European periphery [need a
serious **re-examination**.]{.underline}

Specifically, [what does the United States gain by pledging to defend
the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania?]{.underline}

The [geopolitical **integrity** of **NATO** rests on]{.underline} the
assumption that [its members]{.underline} are, out of calculated
self-interest, [committed and able to help defend every
country]{.underline} within the alliance.

However, [if Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuania are **unable** to **provide**
the transactional **value**]{.underline} that the United States does for
them through its robust military and economic power, [this **would
undermine the rationale** for guaranteed reciprocity in security and
defense.]{.underline}

There are [three criteria]{.underline} for assessing how other countries
might improve the security of the United States. First, [can the
country]{.underline} in question [aid the United States in a decisive
manner]{.underline} if the US were attacked by another great power?
Second, [does it help preserve the balance of power]{.underline} in a
region of critical interest to the United States? Third, [does it
provide economic value]{.underline} that, if lost, would dramatically
weaken the foundations of American national power?

[**If** the answer]{.underline} to all three of these questions [is
"**no**", then a geopolitical relationship]{.underline} based on
guaranteed reciprocity in security and defense [is much more **likely to
be a liability than an asset**.]{.underline}

At present, there are only three countries that undoubtedly qualify as
[**great powers**: China, Russia, and the United States]{.underline}.
Not only are they the three largest countries in the world but, in
relative terms, [each maintains **formidable** military
**capabilities**]{.underline} reinforced by large nuclear weapons
arsenals. The United States and China enjoy the additional advantage of
having the [two largest economies in the world while retaining
significant latent power capabilities]{.underline} with large national
populations.

If the United States were attacked by either of these countries,
[neither Estonia nor Latvia nor Lithuania could provide decisive
military or economic support]{.underline}. None have nuclear weapons and
their national GDP's are only \$31 billion, \$35 billion, and \$54
billion, respectively.

[Ironically]{.underline}, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania [were three of
the nine countries that met NATO's defense spending
requirements]{.underline} in 2020 and each has punched above their
weight in contributing troops to the NATO missions in Iraq and
Afghanistan[. Yet, in total, they have less than 50,000 active-duty
armed forces personnel]{.underline} and the combined size of their
[national populations is less than 7 million.]{.underline}

[A **great power war**]{.underline} between the United States, China, or
Russia is [un**likely** to take place without the use of strategic
**nuclear** weapons.]{.underline} However, even in the event of a
limited conflict outside of American, Chinese, or Russian territory,
[the **Baltic** states would **not** be able to **effective**ly mobilize
enough forces to tip the **balance** in the United States'
favor.]{.underline}

Given their geographical, economic, and military disadvantages, the
Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian [militaries have a primarily
**defensive** force **structure**]{.underline}. Notwithstanding their
NATO support missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, [their forces would be
**unable** to undertake sustained offensive operations]{.underline} in
foreign territory as a defeat would likely leave their homeland
defenseless.

Therefore, it follows that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are [also not
key to preserving the balance of power in Europe.]{.underline} The
foundations of European [geopolitical strength largely rest upon the
militaries and economies of the **U**nited **K**ingdom, **France**,
**Germany**, and **Italy**]{.underline}. Additionally, the United
Kingdom and France are both nuclear weapons states with the former
possessing sea delivery capabilities and the latter possessing both air
and sea delivery capabilities.

[In the Baltic region]{.underline} specifically, Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania are le[ss important in determining the balance of
power]{.underline} than the larger and much wealthier countries of
Poland, Germany, Sweden, and Finland.

[For Russia, taking control of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania would not
dramatically alter its strategic position]{.underline}. [It already
**has access** to the Baltic Sea from bases in the
Kaliningrad]{.underline} (a small piece of territory which lies between
Lithuania and Poland) and Leningrad oblasts.

The [**costs** of occupying any or all these countries would
**outweigh** any marginal **gains** in increased access to the Baltic
Sea or material resource]{.underline}s. [**Annexation** of the Baltic
states]{.underline} would [**raise** already-high threat
perceptions]{.underline} in neighboring countries such as Poland and
Sweden and could [provide the pretext for an increased American
footprint]{.underline} in the region in the name of supporting its NATO
allies. Consequently, it would [**fuel** a costly and **risky**
self-perpetuating **cycle** of regional force buildups]{.underline} and
maneuvers that would [**needlessly aggravate tensions** between
Washington and Moscow.]{.underline}

Finally, when compared with the hundreds of billions of dollars in trade
the United States does bilaterally with countries such as China, Mexico,
and Germany, [America's commercial relationship with the Baltic states
is relatively insignificant.]{.underline}

In 2020, American trade with the Baltic states was less than \$4 billion
while trade with Germany alone was over \$150 billion. Neither are the
goods and services exchanged especially remarkable. Exports and imports
between the United States and Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania primarily
consists of electronics and computer equipment, chemicals, liquor and
alcohol, and miscellaneous industrial products.

[A significant reduction in any of these imports would not impact the
foundations of American economic or military powe]{.underline}r in any
meaningful way. Likewise, for the Baltic states, their largest trading
relationships are with neighboring countries in the European Union and
not the United States.

[Given this analysis, it is **worth considering** if it would be prudent
for the **U**nited **S**tates to **withdraw** from NATO
altogether.]{.underline}

[Regardless of NATO's treaty obligations]{.underline}, there [is **no
strategic value**]{.underline} in fighting a war on Russia's border to
defend three countries that contribute virtually nothing to U.S.
national security. [If Article Five were invoked, American policymakers
would be **at a loss** to justify an all costs-no benefits military
intervention.]{.underline}

By this measure[, an **American withdrawal** from NATO could end up
**strengthen**ing the **integrity** of the alliance]{.underline} by
making countries who have a greater interest in the alignment of the
Baltic states, such as Germany, Poland, Sweden, and Finland, primarily
responsible for the region's security.

Ironically, [the Baltic states are more committed to NATO than their
larger and wealthier allies]{.underline} to the west as evidenced by
their higher levels of defense spending and troop deployments to the
Middle East.

However, [their **commitment** to strengthening the integrity of the
alliance does not match their ability to defend its most important
member]{.underline}. In joining NATO, they correctly calculated that the
United States would contribute more to their security than they would in
return.

#### NATO military engagement escalates tensions with Russia and the Baltics---the US is not willing or capable to provide necessary forces. 

**Kuhn, 18** (Ulrich Kuh, 3-28-18, nonresident scholar at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, and the head of the arms control and
emerging technologies program at the Institute for Peace Research and
Security Policy at the University of Hamburg, "Preventing Escalation in
the Baltics,"
<https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/03/28/consequences-for-nato-pub-75881>//mahimahi)

[If NATO wants to deny Russia the ability to **successfully attack** one
or more Baltic states, it has little choice but to deploy forces on a
much larger scale than it currently does]{.underline}.

While such measures might mitigate the short-term risk of deliberate
Russian escalation, they would create a number of severe political
trade-offs. First, a deterrence-by-denial approach would risk
overstretching the delicate political consensus among NATO members about
conventional deterrence and assurance. A number of member states,
perhaps led by Germany and France, would not support such a policy and
would seek to block it. Even more importantly, perhaps, not even the
Baltic states are supportive of such a maximalist approach. [While many
Baltic officials and experts would like to see greater U**.S. military
engagement** in the region, some of them are highly skeptical of the
assumptions underlying the RAND war games and think that they are too
pessimistic about **Baltic defenses**. While they would like to see a
strong, **unified allied response** to the growing threat from Russia,
they also recognize the need to avoid unnecessarily **escalating general
tensions** with Russia.2 Also, against the background of often
contentious debates within NATO about **financial and military burden
sharing**, it would not be clear at all who would provide the necessary
funds and forces]{.underline} for such a large military footprint.
[Neither the **United States nor** most other **allies** currently seem
to be both willing and capable.]{.underline}

[Second, instead of preventing deliberate Russian escalation this
deterrence-by-denial approach could, in fact, reinforce **Russian
perceptions of insecurity**. Russia would be loath to accept a NATO
force that size so close to its borders]{.underline}. Moscow might seek
to prevent NATO force deployments through various means, including, not
inconceivably, by considering the preventive use of force (that is,
Russia might wage a war because it could only see its position
deteriorating in the future). [This risk might become more acute in the
early stages of a crisis when Russia could misinterpret the
**large-scale movement** of sizable forces, such as the 70,000 personnel
reinforcement the RAND study suggested, as NATO preparations for a
preemptive attack on Russia]{.underline}. [Third, large-scale
**conventional deployments** could]{.underline} help further solidify
Russian reliance on its nuclear deterrent and could even [serve to
**lower Russia's threshold** for nuclear use, making the early
employment of nuclear weapons more likely]{.underline}.

### 1NC -- ! -- Enlargement Bad 

#### NATO enlargement has opened the door to military risks -- US engagement is counterproductive because they will either overestimate or understimate risks. 

**Kuhn, 18** (Ulrich Kuh, 3-28-18, nonresident scholar at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, and the head of the arms control and
emerging technologies program at the Institute for Peace Research and
Security Policy at the University of Hamburg, "Preventing Escalation in
the Baltics,"
<https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/03/28/consequences-for-nato-pub-75881>//mahimahi)

[For the past twenty years, as NATO has mostly pursued an **open door
policy** toward Central and Eastern Europe, the alliance has grown by
integrating former members of the Warsaw Pact, nonmembers who were
previously friendly with the Soviet Union, and three former Soviet
republics (the three Baltic states). The principles underlying
enlargement are that new member states must choose freely to join
NATO]{.underline}, that they fulfill a number of political and military
criteria (such as having settled any ethnic or external territorial
disputes, as well as being able to contribute militarily and financially
to collective defense), and that their accession strengthens the
alliance.1 In addition, NATO has fostered close cooperative ties with
all other former Soviet republics and continues to champion their
political independence. At [the same time, **NATO has engaged Russia**
to try to alleviate Moscow's concerns about NATO enlargement and to
pursue cooperation in areas of common security interest, such as
**mutual military risk reduction** and
**counterterrorism.**]{.underline} NATO insists that it does not seek
conflict with Russia.2

[NATO members have sometimes disagreed about which elements of this
approach to prioritize; at times, **fractures** between different
**national positions** have become very visible. For example, at NATO's
2008 Bucharest Summit, the United States and some other allies pushed
for Georgia and Ukraine to become members, directly challenging a core
Russian interest. But **France and Germany blocked this** proposed
accession]{.underline}, partly because they were concerned about
Russia's likely negative reaction and partly because they questioned the
fitness of these states to join NATO and their potential to strengthen
the alliance.3

Russia's occupation of Crimea and subsequent deterioration in relations
with NATO has again pushed the task of collective defense to the
fore.4 At its 2016 Warsaw Summit, NATO allies underscored that Moscow is
now considered to be a "challenge \[to\] the Alliance" and "a source of
regional instability."5 [To meet this challenge, NATO agreed first and
foremost to assure its easternmost allies and to enhance its means of
**deterring and defending** against Russia. But allies also recognized
the need to increase the **resilience of all members** and to seek
dialogue with Russia.]{.underline}

GENERAL UNCERTAINTY

For NATO, the Russian challenge presents multiple uncertainties, which
exacerbate the potential for disagreement. For starters[, NATO members
have different views of Moscow's intentions in the post-Soviet space and
toward the alliance. Some officials from certain members---including the
three Baltic states, Poland, and the United States---have repeatedly
claimed that the Kremlin is "revanchist," in the sense that it
purportedly wants to redraw the map of Europe.6 They argue that
**Russia's aggressive actions** in Ukraine demonstrate Moscow's
willingness to use force in the former Soviet republics]{.underline}.
They fear that Moscow could even use military force against the
alliance, particularly the Baltic states. At a minimum, they see Russia
as a challenger of the status quo---a view diametrically opposed to
Moscow's view of itself.

[For NATO, the Russian challenge presents multiple **uncertainties,**
which exacerbate the potential for disagreement.]{.underline}

[In addition, the states that see Russia as revanchist are mindful of
**Russian domestic politics** and how these forces interact with the
tensions with NATO.]{.underline} According to a popular---and probably
correct---theory, Putin, confronted with an ailing Russian economy, to
some extent may need the friction with NATO, and particularly with
Washington, to hold on to power.7 According to this theory, Putin's
efforts to foster nationalistic support to divert attention from
Russia's deep-seated domestic problems could even force him to
militarily test the alliance one day.

[Other NATO members---such as France, Germany, and Italy---seem rather
**skeptical that Moscow presents a**n immediate military **threat** to
NATO]{.underline} and question the plausibility of Russia waging war
against the world's most powerful military alliance.8 Some former
officials and analysts from these countries agree with the Kremlin's
view that NATO has moved too far east and understand how Russia could
perceive NATO enlargement as a threat.9

[This general disagreement about current and projected Russian
intentions and interests is important because it **exacerbates** the
potential for **escalation** for two quite different reasons. First, if
NATO underestimates the threat from Russia, that may give Moscow reason
to test the alliance's resolve---maybe even by escalating to the use of
military force against **NATO's weakest link, the Baltic
states.**]{.underline} In this case, an incorrect threat assessment by
NATO could invite Moscow to deliberately escalate the already simmering
general tensions with NATO and go a significant step further, perhaps by
invading one of the Baltic states. [Second, and conversely, if NATO
overestimates the threat from Russia, its well-intentioned defensive
measures may reinforce legitimate, as well as imagined, **Russian
security concerns**. In this case, misreading the threat could lead NATO
to create additional pressure on Moscow to up the ante, which could lead
to both **arms races and increased tensions**---making escalation more
likely]{.underline}. These two potential risks---of NATO doing too
little and doing too much---create very specific escalation risks in the
Baltic region, in both the conventional and nuclear realms.

THE RISKS OF CONVENTIONAL ESCALATION

[The regional imbalance between NATO's and Russia's conventional forces,
NATO's own **deterrence loopholes,** and the geography of the Baltics
all make both deliberate and inadvertent escalation possible. Although
NATO as a whole has much **greater conventional military capabilities**
than Russia, Moscow enjoys a significant margin of conventional
superiority in the wider Baltic region (see map). Russia has been
heavily **funding and modernizing** its aging armed forces over the last
decade, making them a credible force again.]{.underline} In addition,
Moscow continues to expand its arsenal of long-range cruise missiles and
other precision-guided munitions.

### 1NC -- ! -- France

#### France wants autonomy in NATO now

**Pannier, 2-4** (Alice Pannier, 2-4-22, assistant professor of European
studies and international relations at Johns Hopkins University\'s
School of Advanced International Studies,

)](https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/how-to-keep-france-engaged-in-nato///mahimahi%20))

[Secondly, the quality of **French-US relations** (and thus French-NATO
relations) depends on the Biden Administration's attitude towards
European defence efforts. President Emmanuel Macron's view of the
articulation between NATO and European defence is --in line with
previous French Presidents-- as follows: "our security also inevitably
requires that Europeans have a greater capacity for **autonomous
action.**]{.underline} \[...\] Europeans must now take greater
responsibility for this European defence, this European pillar within
NATO. [\[...\]. NATO and European Defence are **two pillars of European
collective security**" (Macron,
2020).[\[1\]](https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/how-to-keep-france-engaged-in-nato/#_ftn1) Macron
managed to get out of the AUKUS crisis in September 2021 with a
recognition, from his counterpart '[of the importance of **European
defence** for transatlantic security and that of
Europe](mailto:https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2021/11/19/jean-yves-le-drian-nos-concurrents-n-ont-ni-tabous-ni-limites_6102656_3210.html)'.
While seemingly symbolic, such declarations could mark a shift after 30
years of US Administrations that warned against 'duplication' rather
than welcoming European **initiatives to develop defence capabilities.**
Seen from Paris, further US insistence will be needed to convince Europe
to fully invest in its capabilities and in the tools developed by the EU
and thus to strengthen NATO's **European pillar.**]{.underline}

#### US withdrawal from NATO incentivizes European defense spending and military developments -- otherwise continued freeriding which undermines democracy 

**Eland, 19** (Ivan Eland, 1-18-19, "NATO May Help Putin, but It Will
Help Americans More," Senior Fellow at the Independent Institute and
Director of the Independent Institute\'s [Center on Peace &
Liberty](https://www.independent.org/centers/copal/),
<https://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=11688>//mahimahi)

[Even if this were true---as it may be---the **time has come to
reassess** whether the U.S. needs to stay in an **outdated alliance**
that was designed to deter the Soviet Union from an attack on Western
Europe during the Cold War,]{.underline} which ended more than a quarter
century ago. In fact, once the Soviet Union fell in 1991, the United
States should have turned NATO over to the by-then rich Europeans to
deter a much-diminished Russia. It was no longer 1949, when the Soviets
still had a massive tank army in central Europe, and most of Western
Europe was in rubble from World War II.

Despite today's hype of a resurgent Russian threat, [Russia still has a
GDP roughly equivalent to Spain. In contrast, the Europeans combined
have a GDP greater than the United States. However, Trump is correct
that the wealthy **Europeans are free riders** on massive and excessive
U.S. defense spending.]{.underline} For example, the mighty German
economy only spends one percent of GDP on defense. [And despite
establishment analysts perennially noting that the only time NATO's
Article V mutual defense clause has been invoked was after the Cold War
ended in response to the 9/11 attacks against the United States**,
European efforts in Afghanistan have been** mostly **window dressing**,
and in any major war, the United States would be defending Europe and
not vice versa.]{.underline}

For most of American history, the country followed the prescription of
George Washington and Thomas Jefferson to avoid "permanent" and
"entangling" alliances, respectively. [Only after World War II did the
United States go wild in policing the world via Pax Americana, with NATO
being one of the **first permanent alliances** established, which has
now turned into an entangling end in itself. Washington and Jefferson
realized that the United States had geographical advantages that other
countries could only dream about]{.underline}---two huge ocean moats
separating it from the world's usual zones of conflict---and thus had
the luxury of using only temporary alliances to enhance its security.

In contrast, historically, Russia has had very poor intrinsic security;
because of bad geography and topography on its western flank, it has
been invaded many times---by, for example, Poland, Sweden, France, and
Germany---the last of which resulted in 25 million dead Russians at the
hands of Adolf Hitler. [Two primary reasons exist for the failure of
post-Cold War democracy in Russia and the **rise of the now autocratic
Putin:** 1) given Russia's precarious security situation, it may be
**impossible for a stable democracy** to take root there; and 2) the
**eastward expansion** to Russia's borders of NATO, an **alliance
hostile to Russia**]{.underline} (think about what the U.S. reaction
would be to Russia forming an alliance with Mexico), after promising
Russia that it would not happen, contributed to the historically aware
country's attraction to an ex-KGB authoritarian ruler.

Putin is certainly no gem, meddling in the U.S. election, stealing
Crimea from Ukraine by armed force, and surreptitiously invading eastern
Ukraine; but Ukraine is very important within Russia's security buffer.
[Although Presidents Barack Obama and Trump both should have taken
stiffer action in response to Putin's election meddling to deter future
interference, that has little to do with whether the United States still
needs to formally pledge to defend affluent European nations against a
**second-rate conventional power,** such as Russia]{.underline}. Even in
the nuclear weapons area, in which Russia is still a superpower, the
British and French nuclear forces provide a deterrent against a
conventional or nuclear attack by Russia on Europe.

[In a post-Cold War world---with the rise of China and \$150 trillion in
unfunded American liabilities (Social Security, Medicare, and federal
and state pensions), including a \$22 trillion U.S. national debt---the
**Europeans need to take over the burden** of their own defense so that
the U.S. can focus on more important things]{.underline}, such as its
own prosperity and thus security. [This change would entail the **U.S.
withdrawing from NATO**]{.underline} but potentially acting as an
informal balancer of last resort only in the unlikely event, given the
aforementioned wealth disparity, that the balance of power between
Russia and Western Europe got out of whack.

Despite the histrionics from establishment pundits and even President
Trump's potentially suspect motives, [the **best U.S. policy is to
withdraw from NATO**, even if it helps the nefarious Putin in the short
term. In the long term, the move will enhance both U.S. and European
security by making American policy more independent and the Europeans
more self-reliant.]{.underline}

#### Democracy solves extinction

Carla Zoe **Cremer &** Luke **Kemp 21**, The Future of Humanity

\"Democratising Risk: In Search of a Methodology to Study Existential
Risk\" <https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2201/2201.11214.pdf> //pipk

[[There is a]{.mark}n intimate]{.underline} and neglected [[relationship
between existential risk and democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[Democracy must be central to]{.mark} efforts [to prevent]{.mark} and
mitigate [catastrophic risks]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is also an
antidote to many of the problems manifest in the TUA. Do those who study
the future of humanity have good grounds to ignore the visions, desires,
and values of the very people whose future they are trying to protect?
[Choosing which risks to take must be a democratic
endeavour]{.underline}.

We [understand democracy]{.underline} here in accordance with Landemore
[as the rule of the]{.underline} cognitively [diverse many who are
entitled to equal decision-making power and partake in a democratic
procedure that includes both a deliberative element and one of
preference aggregation]{.underline} (such as majority voting)45,115.
Decision-making procedures are not either democratic or non- democratic,
but instead lie on a spectrum. They can be more or less democratic,
inclusive, and diverse.

We posit [three reasons]{.underline} for why we should democratise
research and decision-making in existential risk: [the nature of
collective decision-making about human futures, the superiority of
democratic reason, and democratic fail-safe mechanisms.]{.underline}

**[Avoiding human extinction]{.underline}**, or crafting a desirable
long-term future, **[is a communal project]{.underline}**. Scholars of
existential risk who take an interest in the future of Homo sapiens are
choosing to consider the species in its entirety. If certain views are
excluded, the arguments for doing so must be compelling.

**[[Democracy will improve]{.mark} our [judgments]{.mark} in both the
governance and the study of existential risks]{.underline}**. [Asking
how our actions today influence [the long-term]{.mark} future [is one of
the most difficult intellectual tasks]{.mark} to unravel, and if there
is a right path, **[democratic procedures]{.mark}** will **[have the
best shot]{.mark} at finding it**]{.underline}. Hong and Page116,117
demonstrate **[[both theoretically and computationally]{.mark} that [a
diverse group]{.mark} of problem-solving agents [will show greater
accuracy]{.mark} than a less diverse group, even if the individual
members of the diverse group were each less accurate.]{.underline}**
**[Accuracy gains from diversity trump gains from improving individual
accuracy]{.underline}**. Landemore115, builds on this work to advance a
probabilistic argument that **[inclusive democracies will, in
expectation, make epistemically superior choices to oligarchies or even
the wise few]{.underline}**. This is [supported by promising results in
inclusive, deliberative democratic experiments from around the
world]{.underline} 118. [In the long run, democracies should commit
fewer mistakes than alternative decision-making procedures]{.underline}.
If this is true, it should improve the accuracy of research efforts and
decision-making. We are more likely to make accurate predictions about
the mechanisms of extinction, probable futures, and risk prevention if
the field invites cognitive diversity, builds flat institutional
structures, and avoids conflicts of interest.

Thereare many ways to consider the interests of the many. Democratic
assemblies could allow global citizens to deliberate about the futures
they prefer, citizens could be surveyed, and the field of ERS itself
could be diversified. At the moment, the field is, as many academic
disciplines are, unrepresentative of humanity at large and variably
homogenous in respect to income, class, ideology, age, ethnicity,
gender, nationality, religion, and professional background. The latter
issue is particularly true of existential risk, which, despite being an
inherently interdisciplinary endeavour, is at the highest levels
dominated by analytic moral philosophers. We need to be vigilant to what
perspectives are not represented in the study of existential risk. An
awareness of bias will go some way towards mitigating its negative
effects. To get close to replicating the cognitive diversity found among
humans, we must begin by inviting different thinkers with different
values and beliefs into the field.

**[[Democracies]{.mark} can [limit harms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Any
approach to [mitigating]{.mark} existential threats [could create
response risks]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the TUA seems particularly
vulnerable to this. [Despite good intentions and curiosity-driven
research, it could justify violence, dangerous technological
developments, or drastically constrain freedom in favour of (perceived)
security]{.underline}. If we hope to explore ideas but minimise harms,
[democracies can]{.underline} be used to [moderate]{.underline} the
[measures taken in response to harmful ideas]{.underline}. It seems, for
example, vanishingly unlikely that a diverse group of thinkers or even
ordinary citizens would entertain the idea of sacrificing 1 billion
living, breathing beings for an infinitesimal improvement in reaching an
intergalactic techno-utopia. In contrast, the TUA could recommend this
trade-off.

[The democratic constraint of extreme measures may simply be a form of
collective selfinterest. Voters are unlikely to tolerate global
catastrophic risks (GCRs), which incur the death of a sizeable portion
of the electorate, if they know they themselves could be
affected]{.underline}. We expect that scholars who do not support
sacrificing current lives in the name of abstract calculations, but
would still like to explore the use of expected value theory in
existential risk, will be in support of [[democratic fail-safe
mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Empirically]{.underline}]{.mark}, this fail-safe mechanism [seems to
[work]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even deeply imperfect democracies, like the
ones we inhabit now, often avert detrimental outcomes.]{.underline}
[[Democracies prevent famines]{.underline}]{.mark} 119 (although not
malnutrition)120. They [make [war]{.mark}]{.underline} --- a significant
driver of GCRs --- [less likely]{.underline} 121. The [inclusion of
diverse preferences in democracies]{.underline}, such as those achieved
through women's suffrage, further [decreases the likelihood of violent
conflict]{.underline} 122. [Citizens]{.underline} often
[show]{.underline} a [significant risk aversion in comparison to their
government]{.underline}. While surveys are notoriously difficult to
collect and interpret, existing **[data suggest that [the public has
little support for nuclear weapons use]{.mark}]{.underline}** 123--125,
**[[but]{.mark} strong [support]{.mark} for [action against
climate]{.mark} catastrophe]{.underline}** 126--128. We can further show
that **[[when citizens]{.mark} deliberately [engage]{.mark} with the
subject at hand, their [concern and readiness]{.mark} for action often
[increases]{.mark}]{.underline}** 118. For example, [citizen assemblies
on climate change have recommended widespread policy-changes across
sectors, amendments to incentive structures and laws against ecocide to
reach emissions targets]{.underline} 129. Indeed, many lament that when
it comes to genetically modified organisms and nuclear power, citizens
are far too riskaverse130 . The problem is not that the public is
riddled with cognitive biases that make them unconcerned about global
catastrophes.

**[[Democratic debate cannot be an afterthought.]{.mark} Navigating
humanity through [crises will involve]{.mark} many value-laden decisions
under deep [uncertainty]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Democratic procedures
can deal with such hard choices. Greater cognitive diversity should be
represented amongst scholars of ERS. Recommendations on [[policies that
would reduce risk should]{.mark} be passed through deliberative
assemblies and [await]{.mark} the [approval of]{.mark} a wider pool of
ordinary [citizens]{.mark}, as they will be the ones who will bear this
risk]{.underline}. A homogenous group of experts attempting to directly
influence powerful decision-makers is not a fair or safe way of
traversing the precipice.

### 2NC -- ! -- France

#### US must withdraw -- France is pissed over Submarine withdrawal -- if not France withdraws from NATO 

**Shuo, 21** (Wang Shuo, 9-23-21, contributor to Global Times, "Will
France play 'NATO withdrawal' card after being stabbed in the back by
US", <https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202109/1234928.shtml>//mahimahi)

[Washington has once again **stabbed its allies in the back** after the
troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. This time, the **victim [is]{.mark}
France.\**]{.underline}
\
[Last week, the US, Australia and the UK formed a trilateral security
partnership, known as AUKUS. Meanwhile, it urged Australia to break its
submarine deal with France by offering US nuclear power technology. As
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in an interview
Saturday, there is a \"serious crisis\" between the allies which will
affect NATO\'s future. Le Drian\'s remarks triggered a heated debate:
Will France break up with NATO after being stabbed in the back by the
US?\]{.underline}
\
France has lost a contract worth 31 billion euros (\$36.5 billion) and,
more importantly, its face. [France has always boasted about its
**global influence,** especially in the Indo-Pacific region, in recent
years. With a total of **8,000 French soldiers** stationed in the
region, it has the biggest military presence among Western countries
after the US. France has also been participating in a series of US-led
military exercises there.]{.underline}\
\
But Washington unexpectedly snatched Paris\'s submarine deal. Besides,
it has left Paris in the dark when forming a new security alliance with
London and Canberra that focuses on the Indo-Pacific region. Paris might
now feel that the US doesn\'t take its oldest ally seriously.\
\
[The impact of this incident will spill over]{.underline} into next
year\'s French presidential election. After four years in office,
President Emmanuel Macron now faces difficulties in fulfilling most of
his promises to the voters. Only his achievements in foreign policy are
somewhat recognized by the French public. But just as the presidential
election approaches in France, what the US has done overturned it all.\
\
E[ven so, the Macron administration still acts cautiously. First,
**France\'s dissatisfaction** was expressed by Le Drian with a
non-diplomatic tone and language. It leaves room for the future. Second,
France canceled Washington\'s reception, toned down celebrations of the
US-French Revolutionary War victory, and recalled its ambassadors to
Washington and Canberra. Third, France has been seeking EU support in
this case, turning the **controversy between Paris and Washington** into
an issue over transatlantic ties]{.underline}. It is a tactic to
increase France\'s own leverage and to prevent the scenario of fighting
alone. In the end, France sent out a signal, whether by accident or on
purpose, that it may pull out of NATO. \
\
Yet only a few politicians in France, such as far-left Jean-Luc
Mélenchon, have raised serious voices to call their country to withdraw
from NATO. Paris\' official attitude over the case is so far vague. This
is undoubtedly an important \"card\" in Macron\'s hand. The Biden
administration is paying great efforts to gang up with allies against
China. So this is not good news for the US. \
\
According to CNBC, US President Joe Biden on Sunday requested a call
with Macron. On Wednesday, [Biden and Macron made their first call after
the diplomatic crisis exploded over the AUSUS deal. Macron agreed to
return his ambassador to Washington. It seems that both sides are trying
to deal with the crisis. \
\
But still, in theory, France\'s \"**withdrawal\" from NATO** is not an
illusion. France has always pursued independence in defense and has a
history of warning to withdraw from NATO. There is no psychological
barrier for the country to break up with the bloc again. On the other
hand, **Macron has repeatedly expressed** his **disappointment with
NATO**. He even once described NATO as being \"brain
dead.\"]{.underline} 

#### US presence causes France to feel emboldened--- strains relations 

**Pannier, 2-4** (Alice Pannier, 2-4-22, assistant professor of European
studies and international relations at Johns Hopkins University\'s
School of Advanced International Studies,

)](https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/how-to-keep-france-engaged-in-nato///mahimahi%20))

[Thirdly, a key element in the quality of French-NATO relations will be
the **degree of convergence** on the **new threat landscape**, and the
respective roles attributed to NATO, individual states and the EU in
**addressing these threats**.]{.underline} When looking at security
challenges that France is concerned with (Russia and China's aggressive
foreign policies, hybrid and emerging security threats, terrorism or
instability in the Middle East and Africa), French decision-makers see a
role for NATO, albeit a limited one, complementing European and national
efforts.

[Close to Europe, France has supported **NATO's renewed investment in
collective defence** after the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the
destabilisation of Eastern Ukraine. France has taken part in NATO's
enhanced Forward Presence (eFP]{.underline}) and welcomes NATO's ability
to design a 'balanced, deterrent and predictable posture' in Eastern
Europe (Ministère des Armées, 2017, p. 23). At the same time, Emmanuel
Macron has been viewed by some NATO partners as ambiguous as he has,
simultaneously, advocated a renewed dialogue with Russia so as to avoid
further misunderstandings.

[When it comes to **threats and instability** south of Europe, which do
matter to France, France has been **reluctant** about the idea of a
significant **NATO engagement**. Despite supporting a NATO '360'
approach, French leaders have **favoured coalitions** or the EU, rather
than NATO]{.underline}, to act in Europe's southern neighbourhood.
NATO's role has nonetheless been welcomed for naval operations in the
Mediterranean or in the Gulf of Aden.

#### French withdrawal creates instability within NATO and decks Europe unity -- empirics prove 

**Blakemore, 2-9** (Erin Blakemore, 2-9-22, journalist and contributor
to History.com, "When France Pulled the Plug on a Crucial Part of NATO,"
<https://www.history.com/news/france-nato-withdrawal-charles-de-gaulle//mahimahi>)

[Over the years, France had come into **conflict** with nearly all of
its **NATO allies**, especially the United States and Britain. Though
all three countries had founded the steering group from which NATO was
born, France had soon fallen out of the driver's sea]{.underline}t[.
French president Charles de Gaulle still resented what he saw as the
**United States' abandonment** during the 1956 [Suez
Crisis](https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/suez-crisis), when the
U.S. effectively **forced France to withdraw** its forces from the area
around the Suez Canal]{.underline} during a conflict over its
nationalization by Egypt. And
he [valued](https://www.nytimes.com/1964/05/03/archives/de-gaulle-and-nato-his-challenge-to-the-alliance-poses-large.html) French
military independence---something he felt could never be achieved within
the context of the alliance.

[Frustration mounted even more when de
Gaulle [suggested](https://www.cvce.eu/en/recherche/unit-content/-/unit/02bb76df-d066-4c08-a58a-d4686a3e68ff/c4bbe3c4-b6d7-406d-bb2b-607dbdf37207) that
France, the United States and Britain be put on **equal footing within
NATO** in terms of nuclear strategy. The proposal failed,]{.underline}
and as a result de Gaulle
began [slowly](https://books.google.com/books?id=tcicr6TrwjUC&lpg=PA93&ots=qxCaygXk-E&dq=tripartite%2520directorate%2520de%2520gaulle&pg=PA93#v=onepage&q=gradually%2520diminished&f=false) reducing
French participation in NATO.
He [withdrew](https://www.cvce.eu/en/recherche/unit-content/-/unit/02bb76df-d066-4c08-a58a-d4686a3e68ff/c4bbe3c4-b6d7-406d-bb2b-607dbdf37207) France
from the Mediterranean fleet and refused to store nuclear weapons from
other countries on French soil.

[The situation reached a **boiling point** by 1963, when the U.S. and
France clashed over a plan to have NATO nations man a North Atlantic
**nuclear fleet**.]{.underline} De Gaulle and his military had planned
their own North Atlantic nuclear fleet, and withdrew France's
participation as a result. Then, in 1966, [de Gaulle struck a final
blow.
He [announced](https://iht-retrospective.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/22/1966-france-finished-with-nato/) that
he was **withdrawing France** from the **integrated military structure**
and that all foreign forces had to leave France.]{.underline}

[It was the first major crisis **faced by the alliance,** and it shook
member nations deeply. On both sides of the Atlantic, politicians and
pundits mused on the best way to proceed forward.]{.underline} President
Johnson castigated De Gaulle in a strongly
written [letter](https://www.cvce.eu/content/publication/1999/1/1/f85d2acd-3287-458e-9486-18a94773a09f/publishable_en.pdf);
Dwight
Eisenhower [proposed](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1965/09/20/290272042.html?pageNumber=4) that
NATO appoint a French commander. For The New York Times' editorial
board, there was only one solution: for the U.S. to stand [down. "Bonn
and London, in turn, must make it clear to Washington that continued
American **predominance cannot save NATO,** but only destroy it,"
they [wrote](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1966/03/20/356110112.html?pageNumber=220).
"The Atlantic alliance can only be restored in one way, through
restoring the unity of Europe."]{.underline}
