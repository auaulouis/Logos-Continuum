### Rupture K Link -- Pragmatism Swiss Army Knife 

#### Embrace pragmatism -- fallibilism, anti-skepticism, and consequentialism are the most effective instruments to navigate both abstract theory and the political world. They're compatible with revolutionary visions but defense misconceives pragmatism as a defense of actual pragmatists.

Chapter 2. 25-28. GJII

[Pragmatism "narrowly conceived" is a philosophical view that consists
of "a set of arguments about **knowledge, meaning and
truth**."]{.underline}1 That said, [pragmatists]{.underline} are an
unruly lot. They [disagree among themselves]{.underline} about various
philosophical and political issues.2 [We are uninterested]{.underline}
here [in adjudicating]{.underline} these disputes. [Our concern
is]{.underline} less with policing pragmatism and its boundaries than
with [advancing a conception of democracy that derives considerable
motivation from its pragmatist bearings]{.underline} but
[that]{.underline} will [prove compelling **whether or not one embraces
pragmatism**]{.underline}. We consequently distinguish between the
general, relatively ambiguous concept of pragmatism and the particular
conception of pragmatism that we endorse. In so doing, we embrace what
Dewey calls "the pragmatic rule" which holds that "in order to discover
the meaning of \[an\] idea ask for its consequences."3 As we formulate
and defend our conception of pragmatism, [we are especially concerned
with highlighting its consequences **for thinking about political
institutions** in general and democratic political
arrangements]{.underline} in particular.

[Our characterization of pragmatism]{.underline} explicitly [is
reconstructive]{.underline}. [We **do not** claim]{.underline} that this
or that classical or contemporary pragmatist [**actually adopts** a
position of the sort we outline]{.underline}. We do, however, draw upon
the resources that those classical and contemporary pragmatists offer as
we formulate our own defensible pragmatist position. Our enterprise is
distinctive in large part because other pragmatists either have not made
the sorts of argument we advance, have derived different implications
from positions we might share, or would resist the more general position
that we reconstruct from particular arguments. We are, in any case,
interested here less in engaging in a full-scale debate with these
writers than in relying upon them, as foil or as warrant, for the
conception that we reconstruct.

[At the most abstract level, one might depict pragmatism as one variety
of **instrumentalism** in that it conceives of **beliefs, conceptions,
theories, and so forth** as tools humans use **to navigate** the natural
and social world]{.underline}.4 This portrait, while perhaps accurate,
is too general to be useful. In order to discern the consequences of
pragmatism, [we need a more fine-grained conception]{.underline}. Here
we understand three commitments as central to pragmatism.

[**First**, pragmatists are committed to **fallibilism**]{.underline}. 5
This commitment has two implications. It means that [pragmatists
recognize that even those beliefs about which **we are most convinced**
may turn out to be **false**]{.underline}. It also means that [whatever
certainty we may attain requires that we **actively organize**
experience in such a way that **our beliefs are
challenged**]{.underline}.6 This requirement is [not nearly so onerous
as it might at first seem]{.underline}. In a sense, we have no other
option. For pragmatists insist that [the social and natural world is
marked by considerable indeterminacy]{.underline}.7 As a result,
[individuals and groups necessarily will **confront unforeseen
contingencies** that will challenge their ostensibly **settled beliefs
and judgments**]{.underline}.8 Fallibilism simply requires that when
faced with such problematic circumstances, [we prove ready and **willing
to revise our beliefs** should they prove mistaken or
erroneous.]{.underline}

[**Second**, pragmatists are committed to
**anti-skepticism**]{.underline}. 9 [While any of our beliefs may prove
false, it is **not possible** for us to suppose that **they all are
false**]{.underline}. As Peirce insists, "[complete doubt"
is]{.underline} impossible, [a mere philosophical
pretension]{.underline}. Peirce did, however, countenance the sort of
"[real and living doubt]{.underline}" that [is generated by problems we
encounter in experience and that prompts us to try to settle our
beliefs]{.underline}. This is "real doubt" precisely insofar as we have
reason to question our beliefs. [For pragmatists, then,]{.underline}
**[both doubt and belief must be justified]{.underline}**.10

[**Finally**, pragmatists are committed to
**consequentialism**]{.underline}. This comes through clearly in the
"pragmatic rule" just mentioned. There, Dewey distills the advice of
Peirce, who urges [pragmatists]{.underline} to "[consider what
effects]{.underline}, which might conceivably have practical bearings,
[we conceive our conception to have]{.underline}. Then, [our conception
of these effects is **the whole of our conception of the
object**]{.underline}."11 The classical pragmatists arguably considered
this advice to be general and took its relevance to the philosophical
problems surrounding the concept of "truth" only as one specific
instance of its broader applicability.12

[Pragmatists also commonly endorse holism]{.underline} in the sense that
they [see beliefs and conceptions as forming interconnected, more or
less coherent webs]{.underline}. This view applies to pragmatism itself.
[Fallibilism, anti-skepticism, and consequentialism are themselves
**interrelated**]{.underline}. **[Start with fallibilism]{.underline}**.
It is clear that [if any of even our most confidently held beliefs might
be false in the pragmatist sense of being useless or self-defeating,
they also **must be revisable**]{.underline}. This [raises the issue of
what bounds]{.underline}, if any, constrain our ability t[o question and
revise our beliefs.]{.underline} **[One temptation here is thoroughgoing
skepticism or relativism]{.underline}**.13 [Pragmatists resist this
temptation]{.underline}. [Instead they embrace an anti-skeptical
position that **limits both the nature and scope of
doubt**]{.underline}. It is plausible to see this combination of
theoretical commitments as among pragmatists' unique intellectual
contributions.14

[Fallibilism and anti-skepticism each sustain the pragmatist commitment
to consequentialism. Pragmatists see the social and natural world as
fraught with contingency]{.underline}. As a result, even our most
fundamental beliefs inevitably will be called into question and
potentially proven false. [**What is important is how individuals and
communities respond** to the resulting tensions and strains, to the real
doubt that unforeseen contingencies generate]{.underline}. Peirce
famously identified [several ways of settling beliefs]{.underline}---the
methods [of tenacity and of authority]{.underline}, the [a priori
method]{.underline}, [and the method of science]{.underline}. And while
he himself insisted that [the **majority of mankind would forever**
resolve doubt via the method of authority]{.underline}, he insisted that
the [**experimentalism** central to science afforded the surest way to
fix or settle belief]{.underline}.15 For experimentation represents the
most reliable way of generating solutions to problematic situations. And
[we assess the results of properly conducted experiments in terms of
their actual or anticipated consequences]{.underline}. We take [this
commitment]{.underline} to be general in the sense that it
[applies]{.underline}, for example, [**not just to theoretical
concepts**, but to **public policies** **and** to **social, economic,
and political institutions** as well]{.underline}.16

[This claim may seem surprising, given]{.underline} the propensity of
some [prominent contemporary pragmatists]{.underline} to
[insist]{.underline} regularly and loudly that [pragmatist philosophical
commitments have no identifiable political consequences]{.underline}.
Indeed, something of an odd, imperfect, and ultimately uncomfortable
convergence has emerged on this point.17 Richard [Posner]{.underline},
for instance, [holds]{.underline} that "[philosophical pragmatism . . .
lacks any political valence and thus is **equally compatible with**
reactionary and **revolutionary social visions**]{.underline}."18
Similarly, Richard [Rorty intones]{.underline}: "[**Philosophy and
politics are not that tightly linked**. There will always be room for a
lot of philosophical disagreement between people who share the same
politics, and for diametrically opposed political views among
philosophers of the same school]{.underline}. In particular, there is no
reason why a fascist could not be a pragmatist in the sense of agreeing
with pretty much everything Dewey said about the nature of truth,
knowledge, rationality and morality."19 In what follows, we focus on the
role that interpretations of the philosophy and politics of Martin
Heidegger play in sustaining what we refer to as the Posner-Rorty
consensus.

### Rupture K Link -- Ballot 

#### Asking for the ballot is a double turn.

the University of British Columbia. "Beyond Inclusion Politics:
Reconstituting the Political Order". 6/2/5.
<https://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2005/Dhamoon.pdf>. GJII

Furthermore, [inclusion discourses can potentially **relativize and
trivialize differences**]{.underline} (Lee & Cardinal, 1998: 226). The
CAPAR goes to some length to avoid this. [It cites the Ethnic Diversity
Survey which]{.underline} found that nearly 50 percent of Blacks
reported discrimination or unfair treatment compared to 33 percent of
South Asians and 33 percent of Chinese respondents (Heritage, 2005: 8);
it [acknowledges that in exploring "the different experiences of
ethno-racial and ethno-cultural groups and to provide meaningful
statistics on racism, race must be compared with other factors such as
gender, age, education and income"]{.underline} (Heritage, 2005: 9); and
it [specifically identifies the value of intersectional
analysis]{.underline} because of the particular "issues affecting
Aboriginal women, racial minority women, and migrant, immigrant and
refugee women" (Heritage, 2005: 27). [Yet **despite these measures**, it
is striking to note that the **plan conflates racism** with colonialism
and anti-Semitism, thereby **undermining** the ability to address
differences. Whilst the plan acknowledges **particular kinds** of
experiences]{.underline} \-- [such as employment discrimination against
ethnic groups]{.underline}, [disproportionate numbers of Indigenous
people in prisons,]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [attacks
against]{.underline} Jewish [synagogues]{.underline} \-- [**it does not
name** these as racism, colonialism and anti-Semitism]{.underline}. Thus
[even though the plan lays out a working definition of
racism]{.underline} (Heritage, 2005: 7-9), [**it fails** to identify the
differing forms of racialized, colonial and anti-Semitic
**experiences**.]{.underline} [**This is important**,]{.underline} for
instance, [because of the ways]{.underline} in which Indigenous [people
are addressed]{.underline} in the CAPAR [without reference to
**historical and on-going colonial legislative acts** that are racially
oppressive]{.underline}, including for the example the Indian Act which
[continues to be used by the state to control status determination and
band membership]{.underline}.4 Though Indigenous peoples are racialized
in ways similar to people of colour through white supremacy, the
attempted erasure of Indigenous bodies, knowledge, resources and land is
distinct from the racism faced by people of colour in Canada. As Lee and
Cardinal state, "By not recognizing hierarchies in categorical
difference, strategies of inclusion contribute to the erasure of
inequality by pluralizing differences and ignoring power and resource
differentials" (Lee & Cardinal, 1998: 226). The role of power should be
critical in any analysis of racialized, ethnic and/or cultural
identities and relations, and yet is strangely neglected in the CAPAR.
Instead, [the plan articulates inclusion through a discourse of
collective unity]{.underline}. One of the three objectives of the CAPAR
is "to strengthen social cohesion through antiracism measures"
(Heritage, 2005: 10). The conclusion reiterates this point in which it
is stated that the priorities of the CAPAR "enhance the value of
Canadian citizenship by strengthening our social bonds, and making our
shared values more relevant to contemporary life in Canada" (Heritage,
2005: 56). In particular the plan highlights the role of Citizenship and
Immigration Canada in integrating immigrants. Whilst the framing of
integration presents ways to include otherwise excluded peoples, the
discourse of inclusion masks the ways in which integration itself can be
wrought with conformist and assimilationalist tendencies. Whilst the
necessity to develop bonds of social cohesion and shared values and
citizenship should be an important feature of the political order,
mechanisms of inclusion can also potentially erase differences that some
groups want to maintain. Many Indigenous leaders made this argument
following the 1969 White Paper which suggested that erasing the
requirement of status for Indians would bring this group of Indigenous
people to the same level of citizenship as other Canadians. As
Indigenous activist and scholar Harold Cardinal (1969) argued shortly
after the White Paper was published, while First Nations people have
historically been excluded because of their status they also depend on
their legal status as 'Indians' to assert treaty rights and make claims
of self-determination.5 Inclusionary goals, in other words, presume that
integration is desirable but without fully accounting for the fine line
between integration and assimilation. That is not to say that the CAPAR
promotes a model of forced assimilation. Rather, [the plan expresses the
desire for inclusion through]{.underline} what Richard Day calls
'[seductive integration']{.underline} (2000: 9). Day argues that
[dominant groups create a society in which excluded Others are
**implicitly seduced into dominant norms, values and
structures**]{.underline} [because their chances of political, economic
and social success are **dependent on integrating** (or being included)
into the core]{.underline}. As such, [inclusion is **framed for the
benefit** of racialized Others rather than as a way to **demand forced
conformity**]{.underline}; [if ethnic and racial minorities become
included into mainstream society through participation in
dominant]{.underline} practices and [structures]{.underline}, or so the
argument goes, [they will reap material benefits]{.underline}. This not
only [overestimates the potential of inclusion to eliminate repressive
and productive forms of power]{.underline} (where one outcome is
racism), but it also [underestimates the ways in which inclusion enables
the state to manage the 'strangeness' of Others]{.underline} through
indirect measures. Put differently, [inclusion does not necessarily end
racism and at the same time it allows the state to regulate racialized
Others]{.underline} by bringing those on the outside into the core.

### Cap K -- Link -- Feminism

#### Feminism fails -- it encourages a "leaning in" to the accumulative tendencies of capitalism

\*does not link to vulnerability

**Fraser 13** (Nancy Fraser, professor of philosophy and politics at the
New School for Social Research in New York, "How feminism became
capitalism\'s handmaiden - and how to reclaim it", *The Guardian*,
10/14/13,
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/14/feminism-capitalist-handmaiden-neoliberal>)
// EL

As a feminist, I\'ve always assumed that by fighting to emancipate women
I was building a better world -- more egalitarian, just and free. [But
lately I\'ve begun to worry that ideals pioneered by feminists are
serving quite different ends. I worry, specifically, that our critique
of sexism is now supplying the justification for new forms of inequality
and exploitation.]{.underline} In a cruel twist of fate, [I fear that
the movement for women\'s liberation has become entangled in a dangerous
liaison with neoliberal efforts to build a free-market society. That
would explain how it came to pass that feminist ideas that once formed
part of a radical worldview are increasingly expressed in individualist
terms. Where feminists once criticised a society that promoted
careerism, they now advise women to \"lean in\". A movement that once
prioritised social solidarity now celebrates female entrepreneurs. A
perspective that once valorised \"care\" and interdependence now
encourages individual advancement and meritocracy]{.underline}. What
lies behind this shift is a sea-change in the character of capitalism.
The state-managed capitalism of the postwar era has given way to a new
form of capitalism -- \"disorganised\", globalising, neoliberal.
[Second-wave feminism emerged as a critique of the first but has become
the handmaiden of the second.]{.underline} With the benefit of
hindsight, we can now see that the movement for women\'s liberation
pointed simultaneously to two different possible futures. In a first
scenario, it prefigured a world in which gender emancipation went hand
in hand with participatory democracy and social solidarity; in a second,
it promised a new form of liberalism, able to grant women as well as men
the goods of individual autonomy, increased choice, and meritocratic
advancement. Second-wave feminism was in this sense ambivalent.
Compatible with either of two different visions of society, it was
susceptible to two different historical elaborations. As I see it,
feminism\'s ambivalence has been resolved in recent years in favour of
the second, liberal-individualist scenario -- but not because we were
passive victims of neoliberal seductions. On the contrary, we ourselves
contributed three important ideas to this development. [One contribution
was our critique of the \"family wage\": the ideal of a male
breadwinner-female homemaker family that was central to state-organised
capitalism. Feminist criticism of that ideal now serves to legitimate
\"flexible capitalism\". After all, this form of capitalism relies
heavily on women\'s waged labour, especially low-waged work in service
and manufacturing, performed not only by young single women but also by
married women and women with children]{.underline}; not by only
racialised women, but by women of virtually all nationalities and
ethnicities. As women have poured into labour markets around the globe,
state-organised [capitalism\'s ideal of the family wage is being
replaced by the newer, more modern norm -- apparently sanctioned by
feminism -- of the two-earner family. Never mind that the reality that
underlies the new ideal is depressed wage levels, decreased job
security, declining living standards, a steep rise in the number of
hours worked for wages per household, exacerbation of the double shift
-- now often a triple or quadruple shift -- and a rise in poverty,
increasingly concentrated in female-headed households. Neoliberalism
turns a sow\'s ear into a silk purse by elaborating a narrative of
female empowerment. Invoking the feminist critique of the family wage to
justify exploitation, it harnesses the dream of women\'s emancipation to
the engine of capital accumulation. Feminism has also made a second
contribution to the neoliberal ethos]{.underline}. In the era of
state-organised capitalism, we rightly criticised a constricted
political vision that was so intently focused on class inequality that
it could not see such \"non-economic\" injustices as domestic violence,
sexual assault and reproductive oppression. [Rejecting \"economism\" and
politicising \"the personal\", feminists broadened the political agenda
to challenge status hierarchies premised on cultural constructions of
gender difference. The result should have been to expand the struggle
for justice to encompass both culture and economics. But the actual
result was a one-sided focus on \"gender identity\" at the expense of
bread and butter issues. Worse still, the feminist turn to identity
politics dovetailed all too neatly with a rising neoliberalism that
wanted nothing more than to repress all memory of social equality. In
effect, we absolutised the critique of cultural sexism at precisely the
moment when circumstances required redoubled attention to the critique
of political economy. Finally, feminism contributed a third idea to
neoliberalism: the critique of welfare-state paternalism.]{.underline}
Undeniably progressive in the era of state-organised capitalism, that
critique has since converged with neoliberalism\'s war on \"the nanny
state\" and its more recent cynical embrace of NGOs. A telling example
is \"microcredit\", the programme of small bank loans to poor women in
the global south. Cast as an empowering, bottom-up alternative to the
top-down, bureaucratic red tape of state projects, [microcredit is
touted as the feminist antidote for women\'s poverty and subjection.
What has been missed, however, is a disturbing coincidence: microcredit
has burgeoned just as states have abandoned macro-structural efforts to
fight poverty, efforts that small-scale lending cannot possibly replace.
In this case too, then, a feminist idea has been recuperated by
neoliberalism. A perspective aimed originally at democratising state
power in order to empower citizens is now used to legitimise
marketisation and state retrenchment]{.underline}. In all these cases,
[feminism\'s ambivalence has been resolved in favour of (neo)liberal
individualism. But the other, solidaristic scenario may still be
alive]{.underline}. The current crisis affords the chance to pick up its
thread once more, reconnecting the dream of women\'s liberation with the
vision of a solidary society. To that end, [feminists need to break off
our dangerous liaison with neoliberalism and reclaim our three
\"contributions\" for our own ends.]{.underline} First, we might break
the spurious link between our critique of the family wage and flexible
capitalism by militating for a form of life that de-centres waged work
and valorises unwaged activities, including -- but not only -- carework.
Second, we might disrupt the passage from our critique of economism to
identity politics by integrating the struggle to transform a status
order premised on masculinist cultural values with the struggle for
economic justice. Finally, we might sever the bogus bond between our
critique of bureaucracy and free-market fundamentalism by reclaiming the
mantle of participatory democracy as a means of strengthening the public
powers needed to constrain capital for the sake of justice.

### Cap K -- Link -- Queerness

#### The affirmative's queer project becomes commodified without an examination of capitalism 

**Hennessy 17** (Rosemary Hennessy, Professor of English and Director of
the Center for the Study of Women, Gender, and Sexuality at Rice
University, "Profit and Pleasure : Sexual Identities in Late
Capitalism", *Taylor & Francis Group*, 8/21/17,

Cultural studies is an extensive and eclectic transdisciplinary mode of
inquiry, marked by contestations, internal divisions, disparate
genealogies, and a rich diversity. I take the risk of offering some
generalizations about it as a body of knowledge, not because I want to
subsume this contentious plurality under a monolithic profile, [but in
order to highlight some of the ways the discourses and paradigms that
came to prevail amid this diversity bear a historical relation to the
process of commodification that has accompanied the triumph of
neoliberalism in the past twenty years. Cultural studies is now a
massively funded field, and in that sense, as in much other cultural
production, its U.S. variant has become the leading global
instance]{.underline}. In some very literal ways, [cultural studies in
the United States has been commodified in that its knowledges have
entered the circuit of commodity exchange pervasively and
profitably]{.underline}. What emerged twenty years ago as maverick
institutes insecurely anchored in academic institutions has become a
full-blown, funded discipline, complete with graduate programs and
Ph.D.s, conferences and cross-continental networks, high-profile
corporate publishers, course readers and histories. Some of the leading
figures in cultural studies have commented on the perils of its success.
Lawrence Grossberg suggested in 1988 that the selling (out) of U.S.
cultural studies was well advanced and that its success story has "all
the ingredients of a made-for-tv movie" (Pfister 204 ). 3 Stuart Hall
has commented on this evolution, too, referring to it as a dangerous
time for cultural studies in the United States precisely because of the
incorporation of academia and the isolation of American intellectuals
within the established confines of institutional academic life. [If
these are boom times for cultural studies, it may be no accident that
these are also times when one of the potentially sharpest combatants of
neoliberalism is losing its critical edge]{.underline}. "In the period
of this Clinton administration," Stuart Hall warns, "\[cultural
studies\] feels like a deeply reactionary form of free enterprise
modernity" (Morley and Chen 397 ). The enormous outpouring of academic
work in cultural studies over the past two decades has also been
characterized by a distinct and emphatic erasure of capitalist economy
from its knowledges, more specifically an erasure of the historical
links between culture and capitalism that is characteristic of cultural
materialism. Critical notice of this de-linking has been a part of the
history of cultural studies, too, however, and more of these critical
voices are beginning to be heard in the United States. For example, the
collection Cultural Studies in Question, edited by Marjorie Ferguson and
Peter Golding, takes this problem as one of its main concerns. 4 In
their introduction, Ferguson and Golding contend that "cultural studies
has neglected the deep structural changes in national and global,
political and economic and media systems by eschewing economic, social
or policy analysis" (xiv). In an essay in the same volume, Nicholas
Garnham argues that [in order to move on and fulfill the promises of its
original project, cultural studies needs to "rebuild the bridges with
political economy that it burnt in its headlong rush towards the
pleasures and differences of postmodernism]{.underline}" ( 56 ). In
large measure this headlong rush took the form of Foucauldian cultural
materialism. We can see this trajectory quite distinctly in the work of
Stuart Hall himself, who finally abandoned his always somewhat tenuous
endorsement of historical materialism by the late eighties in favor of
the post-marxism of Foucault and Laclau and Mouffe. 5 Hall's
contributions to cultural studies are formidable, as evidenced in his
own work, his relationship to the many projects produced out of the
Center for Contemporary Cultural Studies in Birmingham, England, and his
transnational influence. 6 At the center, after a protracted engagement
with Althusserian marxism throughout the seventies, Hall and other
scholars shifted their attention from grappling with the problem of how
to address the relationship between capitalism's economic base and the
cultural-ideological superstructure to elaborations of the internal
articulation of the superstructure itself (Sparks 83 ). In the next
decade and into the nineties concern with the complex causal connections
between capitalism's underlying structures and cultural forms and with
any specifically marxist analysis virtually disappeared from the
incorporation of cultural studies. One index of the materialism that has
come to define the British legacy can be seen in the Open University
textbook series Culture, Media and Identities . [These are glossy,
well-packaged books aimed at introducing an undergraduate audience to
cultural studies. Each of them follows a heuristic model called "the
circuit of culture." Through a circuit of interlocking relations ---
production, consumption, regulation, representation --- this model
illustrates the various processes by which identities come to
be]{.underline}. The authors assert that it is "possible to start at any
point" ( 2 ) in the circuit, but that an analysis has to go all the way
round in order to be complete. [Two features of this heuristic are
notable: capitalism's relationships of exploitation have no determining
force on culture because "culture is now regarded as being as
constitutive of the social world as economic or political
processes]{.underline}." Not only this, the authors go on to confirm,
"in recent years 'culture' has been promoted to an altogether more
important role as theorists have begun to argue that because all social
practices are meaningful practices, they are all fundamentally cultural"
(duGay 2 ). In the Open University series textbook Identity and
Difference, edited by Kathryn Woodward, the "production" and
"consumption" of identities are also thoroughly cultural activities.
[The section on "Sexualities," by Lynn Segal, for example, treats the
ways sexual identities are represented through cultural texts and
symbolic systems. It includes a historical perspective that stretches
from Anglo-European sexology to queer theory, and indeed it does mention
scholarship that "correlate\[s\] shifts in scientific accounts of sexual
difference with wider social changes and contests for power" (Segal 190
). But there is no mention of what these "wider social changes" might
be, what they might have to do with adjustments in capitalism's
relations of labor or with forms of commodification.]{.underline} The
question remains whether abandoning all causal connections between
culture and material relations outside of culture has strengthened
cultural studies' critical edge. My own view is that it has not. [It
seems to me that no analysis of cultural forms that professes to
critically intervene in the violence taking place in the wake of
neoliberal social policies can evade the historical relationships
between culture and capital. In promoting a view of culture severed from
any ties to the fundamental structures of capitalism, cultural studies
is helping to produce forms of consciousness that supplement
neoliberalism's conservative individualism. While much work in cultural
studies may seem overtly opposed to the privatizing tactics of
neoliberalism, to the extent that cultural studies produces ways of
understanding that exile meaning-making and identity in the realm of
culture, sheltered from any link to capital or class, its discourses
reiterate a cultural logic that has been one of capitalism's most potent
ideological forms.]{.underline} Surprisingly, this is a view that Stuart
Hall himself intimates against the grain of his own later work. In an
interview in 1992 , he predicted that in the future class concerns will
be more central to cultural studies than they were in the eighties. In
fact, he added, "I am sure that we will return to the fundamental
category of capital" (Morley and Chen 400 ). 7 What would it mean to
reverse this trend, to return cultural studies to the fundamental
category of capital? How might we do so in a way that would allow us to
link culture to the development and meeting of human needs and yet not
forfeit inquiry into the complex ways cultural forms and identities are
historically articulated? Of course, I am especially interested in how
the answers to these questions might affect how we understand sexual
identity. [Sexual identity has become one of the prime channels of
cultural studies' "headlong rush toward the pleasures and differences of
postmodernism." Not only has it provided the occasion for much new work
on the libidinal economies of culture, but sexual identity also has been
hailed as the basis for new postmodern models of political alliance and
cited as an obvious index of the limits of class analysis. 8
Consequently, the very possibility of linking the study of sexual
identity to capital has become all but unspeakable. As a way into this
hypermanaged forbidden zone of cultural work, I want to suggest that we
revisit some of the abandoned debates in the encounter between cultural
studies and marxism at the dawn of neoliberalism.]{.underline}

#### Desire is predetermined by capitalism -- consolidation of new identities that inevitably pursues the logic of commodification limits the development of collective agency

**Hennessy 17** (Rosemary Hennessy, Professor of English and Director of
the Center for the Study of Women, Gender, and Sexuality at Rice
University, "Profit and Pleasure : Sexual Identities in Late
Capitalism", *Taylor & Francis Group*, 8/21/17,

[By the late nineteenth century, the market economy in Europe and the
United States was also drawing sexuality out of the family in many
forms, in commercial entertainment and new kinds of nonprocreative
intimacy]{.underline} (D'Emilio and Freedman 166-- 200 ). The
recruitment of women into the workforce in the colonies and the
metropolitan centers was a crucial component of these changes,
negotiated ideologically through the often contradictory adjustments to
women's and working-class men's positions as subjects of consent, of
property, and of racial identity. For women, the discourses of sexuality
often organized access to political agency and ownership. Women
continued to provide invisible labor in the home, and a gendered
division of labor within the family alliance remained essential to the
production of labor power and by extension to the accumulation of
surplus value in the marketplace. [The new technologies of sex operated
in a normative, dialectical way both to undermine and to resecure this
arrangement, and one of the ways they did so was through the reification
of sexual identity. The reification of sexual identity in the late
nineteenth century is overdetermined by a set of structural changes in
capitalist production that involved technological developments, the
mechanization and consequent de-skilling of work, the production boom
brought on by technological efficiency, the opening of new consumer
markets, and the eventual development of a widespread consumer
culture]{.underline} (Hobsbawm 34-- 55 ). A new and growing mass media,
including the advertising industry, displaced unmet needs into new
desires and offered the promise of compensatory pleasures, or at least
the promise of pleasure in the form of commodity consumption. The
inducement of social demand and consumer desire was one of the key
components of the new consumer culture and a crucial mechanism through
which capitalist overproduction was managed ideologically. This process
took place on multiple fronts and involved the formation of newly
desiring subjects, forms of agency, intensities of sensation, and
economies of pleasure that were consistent with the requirements of a
more mobile workforce and a growing consumer culture. Most
significantly, the position of desiring subject was gradually being
opened to women who would eventually be recruited as the ideal and
consummate consumers. [Related to the formation of new desiring subjects
was the emergence of the new identities heteroand homosexual. These new
subjects of sexual desire were at odds with a Victorian gender hierarchy
that accorded the position of desiring subject only to men]{.underline}.
As George Chauncy has argued, the differentiation of homosexual desire
from cross-gender behavior at the turn of the century reflects a major
reconceptualization of the nature of human sexuality. Basic to this
change was a shift from a paradigm for human sexuality in which men were
active sexual agents and women were passive or passionless sexual
recipients. Active or passive sexual aim --- which was taken to be
paradigmatic for one's masculine or feminine gender role --- had
formerly been more important than sexual object choice. More and more
frequently, however, [sexual object choice became the distinguishing
feature of sexual identity, and it was on the basis of this standard
that the distinction between heteroand homosexuality was
erected]{.underline} (Chauncy 1994, 92 ). The emergence of new consuming
and desiring subjects only gradually and unevenly displaced the
Victorian social logic of gender with the modern logic of sexual object
choice ( 100 ; Floyd 173 ). The dialectical process of "displacement" is
a significant instance of overdetermination here. [The new identity
categories heteroand homosexual disrupted the bourgeois gender hierarchy
that had supported a domestic economy of household production and
property rights in that they accorded both men and women positions as
subjects and objects of desire. But a patriarchal gender hierarchy was
reinscribed in the emergent heteronorm and its homosexual other to the
extent that the oppositions between femininity and active desire and
between masculinity and sexual objectification remained
intact.]{.underline} Heterosexuality became a normative identity whose
stability was guaranteed through an array of reified perverse (sexual
and racial) others but also through a modernized gender hierarchy. In
other words, the organizational structures of gender and desire on which
heteronormative identity relies prescribe a double reification of the
human capacity for sensation, affect, and social intercourse.
Heteronormativity posits a "natural" equation between sex (male or
female) and gender (masculine and feminine) and it polices desire
according to a gendered asymmetry between sexual subject (e.g.,
masculine) and object choice (feminine). At the same time, heteronorms
reify homosexuality --- defining, disciplining the human potential for
sensation and social intercourse into an identity that complies with the
heteronormative logics of gender and desire, only perversely so. It was
only gradually through the nineteenth century that homosexuals,
predominantly men, came to be seen as discrete sexual identities whose
perverse sexual desire (men for men) was interpreted (and sometimes
lived) through a heteronormative gender scheme. Sexual identity as an
identity organized around whom one desires to be sexual with was
engendered out of the scientific effort to explain and to tame
disruptions of the gender system. This gradual shift from gender
(in)coherence to (homo)sexual desire as the basis for identity is
evident in the writing of late-nineteenth-century sexologists. In the
work of the first generation of sexologists, the "invert" or "third sex"
is in fact a subject who presents an incoherently gendered identity. The
term "invert" was first used in the mid-nineteenth century to describe
not homosexuality but a broadly transgendered condition of which
same-sex desire was one symptom (Hekma; Prosser 135-- 55 ). Generally
the term "invert" is understood in terms of the classic description of
"a woman trapped in a man's body." As an individual who makes sense of
himself or herself as incoherently gendered, or as someone who is
understood that way by others, the invert transgresses the gendered
fabric of possessive individualism. After 1900 (which marked the
publication of Havelock Ellis's Sexual Inversion ) the term "invert"
fell out of common use as gender difference was increasingly being
folded into a new conception of sexual difference based on a desiring
subject constructed in terms of aim or object choice. Freud, for
example, refigures the transgendered components of inversion into
perverse sexual object choice; other perversions and related sexual
identities are understood to be deviations from a normative sexual aim.
In this way the "invert's" transgender identity becomes only one stop on
the way to homosexual identity. This shift to sexual object choice as
the defining feature of sexual identity has a contradictory relationship
to patriarchal gender ideology. The emergence of a new subject of sexual
desire was conditioned by the gradual disruption of gender distinctions
taking place through changes in the division of labor, property, and
consent law. This was a subject that was not defined so much in terms of
species needs for reproduction as in terms of individual consumer
preferences or the objects he or she desires (Birken 49 ). But the
challenge to the asymmetrical gender scheme of bourgeois culture was not
so pat. In sexology, for example, we find that even as the promotion of
this new consuming subject of desire opened up the possibility of
challenging the gender differences that defined reproduction, it also
erected a new version of them. [By emphasizing the multiplicity of
individual preferences and the idiosyncratic nature of desire, and by
starting with the assumption that individuals are first of all free
consumers --- or subjects of desire --- sexology disrupted the
traditional bourgeois gender hierarchy. At the same time sexology
performed the conservative function of reinstalling the heterogender
paradigm within this new sexual ideology of desire. As sexuality was
being wrenched free from reproduction and everyone was potentially being
sexualized, the threatening possibility of a genderless sexual desire
was contained by a new paradigm of sexual identity that articulated it
in a heterogendered frame. The new identities heteroand homosexual,
based as they were on the appropriate gender of the object of desire,
became ways of distinguishing sexual identities that not only tamed the
potential threat to patriarchal gender difference but actually
reincorporated it into a new (heterogender) ideology of sexual
identity]{.underline}. The increasing differentiation of sexual
identities (in the form of perversions) reflected the decline of older
holistic concepts of gender and the articulation of newer, more
object-oriented ones. [The implications of this transcoding of gender
were most telling for women. That women were permitted a new sexual
agency may have been a break from the bourgeois gender ideology of
passionless womanhood, but the desiring feminine subject was acceptable
only so long as she directed that desire toward a heteronormative goal
in which she was not the agent but the object of desire. The enfolding
of bourgeois gender ideology within the new ideology of sexual desire
helped forestall the possibility of even imagining lesbian desire in any
other terms than female inversion]{.underline}. Consequently, until well
into the twentieth century, sexologists and the culture at large could
only conceive of the "real" lesbian who desires another woman by
engendering her as "mannish" or butch (Birken 94-- 96; Chauncy 107 ).
The heteronormative identity that was consolidated in the late
nineteenth century, then, prescribes a double reification of the human
capacity for sensation, affect, and social intercourse through the
organizational structures of gender and desire: it proposes an equation
between sex and gender and it organizes desire according to the gendered
asymmetry, which we might call "heteropolarity." [At the same time,
heteronorms reify what comes to be known as "homosexuality"--- defining,
disciplining the human potential for sensation and social intercourse
into an identity that complies with the heteronormative logics of gender
and desire, only perversely so. In other words, the heteronormative
paradigm set the terms even for queer desire.]{.underline} The emergence
of this heterogendered, heteropolar normative paradigm and of the
reified identities of heteroand homosexual is an important feature of
the historical formation of a new desiring subject. Sexology's
construction of a sexuality of desire separated the human capacity for
sensation and affect from the ideology of family need. As a new subject
of desire rearticulated bourgeois gender ideology in this and other
cultural sites, the relationship between sexual identity and gender
remained uneven, contradictory, and prescribed. The construction of
sexual identity in terms of object and aim potentially made it possible
to conceive of all combinations of desiring subject and object
(masculine/feminine man or masculine/feminine woman desiring
masculine/feminine man or masculine/ feminine woman). [But because
capitalist investment in a heterogendered division of labor persisted,
the potentially arbitrary boundaries between sexual identity and gender
identity would continue to be secured through heterogendered norms, even
as those boundaries were contested and unevenly articulated in
mainstream and counterculture. By scripting desire in terms of
heterogendered identities that are understood to be opposite sexes, the
distinction between heteroand homosexuality controlled the unruly
possibility posed by the new desiring subject]{.underline} --- the
possibility that masculinity, femininity, sexual agent, and sexual
object might indeed correlate in any number of possible desiring
combinations within or between persons. I am not the first to argue that
the consolidation of two distinct social identities --- heteroand
homosexual --- is not simply a discursive event or a cultural
phenomenon. Several historians have made this point. John D'Emilio's
well-known early essay argues that it was two aspects of capitalism ---
wage labor and commodity production --- that allowed men and women to
call themselves gay, to see themselves as part of a community, and to
organize politically on the basis of that identity. D'Emilio and Estelle
Freedman as well as other scholars (George Chauncy, Jeffrey Weeks) have
suggested that commodity consumption was also a key material condition
for the emergence of new sexual identities. The late-nineteenthcentury
shift to a consumer economy provoked a more widespread acceptance of
pleasure, self-gratification, and personal satisfaction that easily
translated to the province of sex. [What I want to stress is that this
cultural-ideological process was overdetermined by the logic of the
commodity, a logic that binds ways of knowing and forms of identity to
changes in the relations of production. In other words, the reification
of sexual identity is overdetermined by the relationships that
capitalist production came to rely on in the late nineteenth century,
relationships that include forms of consciousness that are adequate to
new demands of production and consumption]{.underline}. These new
demands took place in several arenas --- among them the recruitment of
women into the workforce and consumer culture and the gradual unhinging
of sexuality from its procreative function as regulated by the family's
patriarchal gender system. One of the most significant displacements was
the conjuncture of rationalized production with the engineering of
desire inducement. Against the background of the Great Depression of the
last quarter of the nineteenth century, the expanding volume of
overproduction fueled the rise of commodity consumption and a new
consumer culture in industrialized nations. The competitive struggle for
control of consumer demand generated the spectacular growth of
advertising and innovations in the field of credit designed to increase
consumption (Birken 120 ). At the same time, the technological
developments responsible for overproduction also spurred new forms of
rationalized labor that would eventually take the form of Fordism. In an
excellent recent essay, Kevin Floyd astutely contends that this
historical development is a significant one in the history of the
subject of desire under capitalism. The conjuncture of engineered
production and engineered desire inducement interfaced with the
construction of men and women as sexual subjects and sexual objects and
helped give desire a certain ideological independence. The result was a
reification of the erotic, ultimately inseparable from the retrenchment
of capitalism (Floyd 178 ), a reification we might understand as
overdetermined by the displacements of new forms of commodity production
and consumption, by the transposition of need into desire, and by
changes wrought in other cultural-ideological categories. Emerging as
the prime institution involved in the formation of sexual identity in
the late nineteenth century, heteronormativity shaped this reification
in the service of the kernel of human relationships essential to
capitalism in several ways. One of them involved the contradictory and
dialectical relationship between sexuality and gender. By the end of the
nineteenth century, heteronormative sexual identity was becoming one of
the historical components of labor and labor power insofar as it
organized forms of consciousness on which social divisions --- including
but not restricted to the division of labor --- would depend. In
disciplining human affect and sensation into discretely gendered
subjects and objects of desire, heteronormativity reinforced the sexual
division of labor in the home as well as the exploitation of women's
labor in the wage market. The distinction between a normative sexual
subject and its abject other on which heteronormativity rested also
served to contain the threat posed to patriarchal gender hierarchies by
the unhinging of sexuality from family. In addition, the reification of
sexual identity was an important part of a much broader process of
moving human eros into the realm of exchange value. By consolidating
human sensation into discrete and bounded sexual identities,
heteronormativity helped shape the human potential and need for
sensation and social interaction (or eros) in terms of objective aims or
desires. This reification of the erotic would prove vital to the
development of commodity culture insofar as it helped consolidate forms
of desire that would be crucial in the marketing and consumption of
commodities. 12 [Satisfaction of needs through exchange value is the
most common phenomenon of alienation, and human sexuality has certainly
entered commodity exchange through this process. But the less visible
relationship between commodification and sexuality lies in the
reification of the human potential for sensation and affect into sexual
identities]{.underline}. Like all cultural practices in capitalist
production, this process was and is a contradictory one. The freeing up
of sensory-affective capacities from family alliances was simultaneously
rebinding desire into new commodified forms. But while heteronorms
organized desire and identity, they never did so completely or entirely
successfully. Unlike the poststructuralist or cultural materialist who
sees these failures as the effect of a radical instability inherent in
discourses or in language itself, the culture theorist who returns her
analysis to capital knows that heteronorms are insecure because they are
sites of ideological crisis and symptoms of the social struggle over
meaning and ultimately over resources. This struggle threatens to
disclose not only the fabricated nature of sexuality but also the social
relations that bind its organization to capital's contradictory
structures. The narratives and social movements of nineteenth-century
marriage resisters, "New Women," and some feminists disclosed many of
these connections and indicated that heteronormative resistance was not
always launched by homosexuals who only gradually as a group countered
the sexual norms they themselves were being framed by. Let me sum up
some of the points I am making. First of all, heteronorms are
cultural-ideological. They depend on the reification of sensory-affect
into identities that legitimate and enable certain historical processes
of capitalism. The gender foundation of heteronormative sexual
identities is directly related to the extraction of surplus value
through the gendered division of labor both in the family's role in the
reproduction of labor power and in the workplace. To the extent that
heteronormativity is premised on a gender hierarchy, it has served to
legitimate and naturalize the gendered division of labor. However, just
because capitalism has made use of heteronormativity does not mean that
it is necessary for capitalist production. Capitalism does not require
heteronormative families or even a gendered division of labor. What it
does require is an unequal division of labor. If gayor queer-identified
people are willing to shore up that unequal division --- whether that
means running corporations or feeding families, raising children or
caring for the elderly --- capital will accept us, and in areas where
production has moved far out of the patriarchal household and
patriarchal gender ideologies have flexed or changed, it has done so,
though unevenly and reluctantly. This limited acceptance is not just a
freestanding cultural phenomenon any more than the emergence of "new
families" includes all non-nuclear arrangements. While
heteronormativity's dependence on gender difference continues to bolster
an unequal division of labor in the home and in the marketplace, and the
ideology of family shelters an unwaged domestic labor force --- whether
straight or gay --- race still has to bear a great share of the burden
for the production of surplus value. The companion to the "New (white)
Gay Family" is the single workfare mother whose sexual identity is less
relevant than her social status as excessive breeder. [Finally, I am
arguing that reified sexual identities --- straight, gay, queer --- are
tied to capitalism's class system in that they are ways of seeing and
knowing oneself and others that shore up the logic of commodity exchange
on which capital is based. This is a logic that abstracts social
phenomena, including human relationships, from the historical conditions
that make them possible. In this regard, claiming a queer identity or
claiming a straight identity can participate in the same cultural logic.
The point I want to stress here is not that sexuality has a class
character or that class trumps sexual identity, but that consolidation
of new sexual identities that pursues the logic of commodification
limits the development of collective agency. The occlusion of class in
theories of sexuality and the disavowal of class struggle or class
affinities in sexual liberation movements are part of the legacy of
capital's commodification of consciousness]{.underline}. One of the
costs of the reification of eros into heteronormative identity and its
homo-alternative is the separation of class and sex analysis. Underlying
this split is the loss of a way of seeing and a form of social
organization that recognizes that human needs are collectively produced
and that can address the immense human toll taken by the contradictory
relationships through which this process is enacted under capitalism.

[Russia's intervention]{.underline} in Ukraine seemingly
[caught]{.underline} the international community and [many International
Relations scholars]{.underline} [by surprise]{.underline}. It has been
[heralded as a [return to
'realpolitik'](https://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/86525)]{.underline} [leading
to a (re)focus on the state]{.underline} as the primary referent point
of international politics. Yet while feminist IR scholars have made
important inroads into the discipline in recent decades, demonstrating
how the [personal is not only political but international
too](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520279995/bananas-beaches-and-bases),
at this time of crisis [we again find feminist]{.underline} [insights
marginalised from mainstream **discussion of the war and its
consequences**]{.underline} (with a few notable exceptions, including
work by [Jenny
Mathers](https://theconversation.com/ukraine-war-families-of-unhappy-russian-conscripts-could-undermine-kremlins-war-effort-178362) and
a subsequently postponed [RUSI

[**Feminists IR scholars have much**]{.underline} value **[to
add]{.underline}** to the discussion to aide our [understanding of the
war and]{.underline} its [gendered impact]{.underline}. [For example,
how masculinities and femininities are **invoked**]{.underline} **in
[constructing Russia]{.underline}** and Ukraine [in geopolitical
imaginaries]{.underline}, the absence of women from both Ukranian and
Russian negotiation delegations, or in the gendered silences of
just who is seen to fight/be protected in Western media coverage, to
name just a few of examples. However, the purpose of this blog is to
focus on the implications of the war for NATO through a feminist lens.

[Feminist IR scholars' primary concern with **NATO**]{.underline} stems
from a premise that [it **functions as an [institution of international
hegemonic masculinity](https://www.militarygender.com/)**]{.underline}.
This has included a focus on how NATO shares lessons on the value of the
Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda and a gender
perspective, [constituting both through a militarist
lens](https://www.militarygender.com/), even if gender work often
remains under resourced and not fully utilised within
the [alliance ](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0192512116638763)and
its [operations](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13533312.2018.1492876).
[Feminist IR **scholars**]{.underline} have [also **examined** **how**
**gendered narratives are invoked to shape** NATO, its value, and
purpose, both internally [**through
storytelling**](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13600826.2018.1440195) and
the interactions of
'[gendermen](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23337486.2016.1264108)'
(and [women](https://www.militarygender.com/)) **and** externally
**through**

strategic** **narratives**]{.underline}.

The value of women, and more recently gender perspectives, to the
alliance is nothing new and [NATO has long been concerned with the
integration of women](https://www.militarygender.com/) into its armed
forces in relation to balancing 'manpower' shortages and supporting
operational effectiveness. More recently, in 2019, NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg stated that "[Gender equality is an integral
part of all NATO policies, programmes and
projects](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_167021.htm)"

Likewise, the NATO/EAPC Policy and Action Plan on WPS makes it clear
that "NATO aims to address gender inequality and integrate WPS through
the Alliance's three core tasks of collective defence, crisis management
and cooperative security \[emphasis author's own\]". Even if 'nations
have the primary responsibility' in respect to collective defence, it is
these nations which makeup NATO and agree its response, they are
therefore responsible for ensuring "the provision of trained troops and
experts on gender issues, as well as a better gender balance in NATO-led
forces depend entirely on national decisions". The NATO WPS policy has
"encouraged \[member and partner states\] to make WPS an integral part
of their defence and security." The test of whether they have or not
comes now.

Despite such a commitment, [we have yet to see NATO]{.underline}, or its
members or partners, [articulate]{.underline} the [relevance of gender
in]{.underline} their [response to]{.underline} the [Russian
intervention]{.underline} in Ukraine. While there remains a lot we don't
know about NATO's reaction, we would expect, if it were in place, for
NATO to have made the case for the relevance of a gender perspective
publicly. If the [response to Russia's actions has seen NATO return to
its Article 5 collective defence founding purpose]{.underline}, it has
also, yet again, [drawn attention to the [disjuncture between the
rhetoric and reality of NATO's commitment to the WPS
agenda](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=nN2A1m4AAAAJ&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=nN2A1m4AAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC)]{.underline}.
This also further undermines and demonstrates the hollowness of
recent [calls for NATO to adopt a Feminist Foreign
Policy](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/why-nato-should-adopt-a-feminist-foreign-policy/).

As **[feminist IR scholars]{.underline}**, we [**should be
asking**]{.underline} not only [where are the
women](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520279995/bananas-beaches-and-bases) but
where are the gender advisors and where is the gender expertise? Is the
NATO Special Representative on Women, Peace and Security being included
in all high-level discussions? Are Gender Advisors being deployed with
the NATO Response Forces? **[Has a gender perspective been incorporated
into NATO's strategic communications?]{.underline}** [Is]{.underline} a
[gender perspective being included in]{.underline} all [decision-making
processes?]{.underline} Has a gender perspective been part of the
briefings at the NATO extraordinary meetings on Ukraine? Which (if any)
member and partners states (including those with Feminist Foreign
Policies, such as Canada, France, Germany, Sweden, Luxembourg and
Sweden) are raising NATO's commitments under WPS as something to be
taken into consideration at these meetings? And what gender expertise
are they contributing substantively? Moreover, given in the last
decade [NATO has begun engaging civil society formally on its WPS
work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=nN2A1m4AAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=nN2A1m4AAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC),
we must ask where are their voices and perspectives now?

This short contribution has sought to raise questions and provocations
related to the WPS agenda and how it has (or hasn't) been invoked in
NATO's response to the Russia-Ukraine War. It has also demonstrated that
**[feminist knowledge and attention to NATO is needed now more than
ever]{.underline}**. It is just one take, and [there remains [more than
one feminist

NATO, while feminism remains a broad school, [even if feminist IR

praxis]{.underline}](https://www.routledge.com/Feminist-Security-Studies-A-Narrative-Approach/Wibben/p/book/9780415457286).
It has shown how, even [at times such as these, **we need to make space
to hear voices outside of the mainstream discourse**]{.underline}, which
might make us uncomfortable or challenge the accepted status quo,
because [doing so **keeps alive the possibility** that **another world

Contradictions in Resolution 1325

As feminist antimilitarists, as women of the Noto-NATO movement, how
should we respond to the integration by NATO of Resolution 1325? After
all, the instrument was universally welcomed by women. Its objectives
were irrefutably sound which is, to draw attention to the impact of
armed conflict specifically its impact on women. Such anticipated impact
is for women to be recognised not as mere victims but as actors, capable
of contributing to the ending of war and to achieving peace and
redefining security. One can imagine that the United Nations Security
Council might see NATO as an exemplary institution, implementing the
resolution in pretty much the manner desired - and desired not only by
the UN (we suppose), but by the women who drafted the Resolution and
pressed the Security Council to pass it. Many of the measures NATO are
introducing in Afghanistan, as described above, are in the
circumstances, desirable. Given that ISAF is present in Afghanistan, we
can only be glad if NATO personnel, prompted by Resolution 1325, behave
respectfully towards women and try not to make their lives any worse
than its current state. If Afghan women are to be searched at
checkpoints, it is certainly more desirable that they should be handled
by women than men. Yet, how can we who oppose NATO, who deplore its very
existence and its war in Afghanistan -- welcome its espousal of 'our'
Resolution 1325? Especially when that war was legitimated by those who
launched it, in part, by its potential for liberating women from
fundamentalist oppression.

I would suggest that there are at least four elements in the
contradiction that is now anguishing many feminist antimilitarists, not
the least, ourselves in the No-to-NATO movement.

The most [obvious and fundamental]{.underline} is the perennial
'[equality' dilemma in feminism]{.underline}. At many moments in the
history of the women's movement, a [divergence]{.underline} has
[surfaced]{.underline} [between]{.underline} [women who call for
'equality' and those who assert 'difference']{.underline}. Those who
stress '[equality']{.underline} [believe]{.underline} that
[equal]{.underline} [treatment of women is simple justice]{.underline}.
Those who stress '[difference' believe **equality** is **too easily
interpreted as 'equality'**]{.underline} **[with men in a men's
worsld]{.underline}**. They call for a transformative change in gender
power relations and a valorisation of women and the feminine. Yet in
turn (and herein lies the contradiction), the [**positive assertion of
difference** can **become**]{.underline} an undesirable
**[entrenchment]{.underline} [of]{.underline}** complementation in
**[gender relations]{.underline}**, trapping us in the gender dichotomy.
The [divergence between 'equality' and 'difference'
strategies]{.underline} [becomes]{.underline} seriously
[divisive]{.underline} [when]{.underline} the [equality demanded by
women]{.underline} [concerns access to **roles** that]{.underline}
self-**[evidently]{.underline}** **[enhance]{.underline}
[patriarchal]{.underline}**, capitalist, nationalist or **[militarist
power]{.underline}**. Serving in the armed forces is an acutely
troubling case in point.

It should be noted that Resolution 1325 does not in fact call for more
women in armies. It urges, in rather careful terms, an expansion of "the
role and contribution of women in United Nations fieldbased operations,
and especially among military observers, civilian police, human rights
and humanitarian personnel." In promoting a higher proportion of women
in militaries, NATO is not actually 'implementing 1325'. The
feminisation of soldiering (at least in my interpretation), is part of
NATO's thrust to modernise and professionalise contributing national
armies. It has picked up the ball of gender equality thrown into play by
feminists and is running with it for its own objectives. What can we do
as feminists in such a situation? We have surely to emphasise that
equality is a matter of justice, and in a just and inclusive society,
women should not be debarred on account of their gender from doing
anything they want to do. Just as ethnic minorities should not be
debarred from police force for instance. But we must simultaneously
critique and seek to dismantle all the power relations that deform and
subvert not only justice in employment, but also the quality of human
life and relationships -- including those of militarism. It's
unimaginable that the struggle for equality can be pursued, anywhere or
ever, except hand in hand with an unrelenting struggle for
transformative change in gender and other power relations.

The second [contradiction]{.underline} I believe goes like this: **[NATO
is a militarist organisation]{.underline}** but the
**[intention]{.underline}** of Resolution 1325 **[is
anti-militarist]{.underline}**. 54 Yet its **[wording]{.underline}** and
provisions [leave it co-**optable by militarism**]{.underline}. In fact,
back in 2000 in New York, the ink was scarcely dry on the document
before quite a lot of the feminist women involved were voicing
self-criticism about their failure to frame the 1325 measures with a
strong statement about ending militarism, militarisation and war itself.
They were advised by those close to the UN system, and indeed informed
by common sense, that the Security [Council]{.underline} [would not
accept any insistence]{.underline} [from the women on]{.underline} the
resolution - [a sharp critique of militarism]{.underline},
militarisation and the pursuit of war policies by member states. That is
indeed why the women originators of the Resolution censored themselves.
All the same, the UN was created to put an end to war. The Security
Council's primary responsibility, under the Charter is the maintenance
of international peace and security.19 Some of the women now wondered,
"should we not have called the Security Council's bluff?"20 Four years
later, Carol Cohn neatly summarised the effect of their failure to
engage in struggle with the Security Council on this issue. She wrote,
[**Protecting women in war**, and **insisting** that they have an
**equal right to participate**]{.underline} [in the processes and
negotiations that end]{.underline} particular [wars]{.underline}, both
[**leave** **war** itself **in place**]{.underline}\... \[1325 is not\]
an intervention that tries either to prevent war, or to contest the
legitimacy of the systems that produce war - that is, 'to put an end to
war'. In this sense, it [**fits** **comfortably** **into**]{.underline}
the already [extant]{.underline} [concepts and **discursive practices
of** the **Security Council**, **where**]{.underline} the dominant
paradigm holds a world [made up of **states** that '**defend'** state
**security**]{.underline} through military means\...[Letting (some)
women into decision-making]{.underline} positions seems a small price to
pay for leaving [the war system essentially undisturbed]{.underline}.21

The third [**contradiction** is inherent **in** the]{.underline} several
interpretations to which the **[word 'security']{.underline}** lends
itself. [Women]{.underline} [have been at pains for a
decade]{.underline} or more now [to redefine 'security']{.underline}.22
[We]{.underline} readily [adopted]{.underline} the [critique of
military]{.underline} [conceptions of security by those who began to
speak]{.underline} and write [of 'human security']{.underline}.23 Then,
in the concept of 'women's security,' we [gave]{.underline} '[human
security' gender specificity]{.underline}.24 This was, for feminists,
the meaning of the word in the title of the Resolution: Women, Peace and
Security. The [**ideal** of 'security']{.underline} can however too
**[readily]{.underline}** be [**manipulated** **by**]{.underline} an
organisation such as **[NATO]{.underline}**, that however it 55 2012
Women in Action describes security in words, **[manifests]{.underline}**
it **[in]{.underline}** action as meaning the
**[militarisation]{.underline}** of society **[and]{.underline}** a
**[readiness to fight wars]{.underline}**.

Fourth, and finally, some of the women who were involved in the movement
to achieve Resolution 1325 were self-critical afterwards on the grounds
that they had failed at any point to express an explicit critique of
men, masculinity and patriarchy in relation to militarism,
militarisation and war. The [Resolution said nothing about the
male-dominant gender order in which we all live]{.underline}, the
supremacy of men in political and military systems, the affinity of
military values with hegemonic masculine values, and the overwhelming
statistical preponderance of men in actual acts of violence against both
men and women, whether in peace or war. As Carol Cohn puts it, to [have
the effect we desire as feminists]{.underline}, the women [transnational
activists]{.underline} in this story would [have to address "the
pernicious, pervasive complexities of the gender regimes that
undergird]{.underline} not only individual wars but t[he entire war
system]{.underline}."25 (I argue that [we should go further and
**recognise gender power relations as a predisposing**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} thus [causal, **factor** **in militarisation and
war**]{.underline}.26) The fact is that, [just as the **UN** cannot
criticise]{.underline} the USA, capitalism and
[militarisation]{.underline}, [so it is quite **unable to make any
critique of masculinity**]{.underline}. Sandra Whitworth would later
write in her post1325 study of UN peace keeping, "There is...no
discussion within UN documents of militarism or militarised
masculinities or, for that matter, of masculinities more generally"
(Whitworth 2004:137). It may be beyond the bounds of reason to [imagine
the Security Council taking the step]{.underline} (albeit logical) from
deploring the rape of women in war [to pointing the finger at men's
perennial propensity for violence and]{.underline} specifically for
[sexual violence]{.underline} against women. Yet, this [silence
on]{.underline} men, [masculinity]{.underline} and the male-dominant
gender order has [vitiated Resolution 1325]{.underline}. In the absence
of a strong statement against the 'co-production' of hegemonic
masculinity and militarism, it [becomes little more than an
aspiration]{.underline} on the one hand, to make war a bit safer for
women, on the other, [to **alert** the **powers**-that-be to **the
resource women can be** **in** **helping them do their
job**]{.underline}. The [**Resolution** is **left hostage to co-optation
by militarist states and military institutions for military
purposes.**]{.underline}

### Fem IR K -- Climate Link

#### Their [securitization]{.underline} of climate change is the continuation of a long line of failed [militaristic policies]{.underline}, only embracing a [feminist]{.underline} perspective can we truly [mitigate]{.underline} their [impacts]{.underline}

**Nagel 15**(Joane, Social and Behavioral Sciences -- Sociology
Professor, "Gender, Conflict, and the Militarization of Climate Change
Policy", CS)

In their 2007 report, National Security and the Threat of Climate
Change, a group of [prominent]{.underline} retired [U.S. military
advisors described climate change as a "threat multiplier]{.underline}"
facing many countries in the world, especially the United States. They
cataloged dangers to national security from climate changerelated
flooding, drought, extreme weather, disease, famine, and environmentally
forced migration. The report's [focus on dangers and conflicts reflected
the institutional perspective and interests of its all-male military
advisory board]{.underline}. They recommended strategic planning to
defend against the threat of climate change. [They did not call for
action on the causes of climate change]{.underline} such as the
reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The [militarization of
climate change]{.underline}, by defining it primarily as a security
threat, [represents]{.underline} one of several ways in which [climate
change policy is gendered.]{.underline} The [international failure to
respond]{.underline} effectively [to climate change]{.underline} also
[can be understood by analyzing the gender dimensions of the
institutions that dominate international climate change]{.underline}
research, planning, and negotiations. In her 2010 Nature article, "Call
in the Women," feminist geographer Susan Buckingham argued that [gender
imbalance is a major reason for the ongoing stalemate in international
efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline}. Starting in 1995,
international environmental leaders have gathered each year at United
Nations Conference of Parties (COP) meetings around the world to settle
on a response to escalating changes in the global climate. In the past
twenty years of annual COP meetings, these mainly [male negotiators have
not managed to produce any significant binding agreements to reduce the
rate and scale of climate change]{.underline}. Negotiators' [inability
to craft an international climate change agreement has persisted in the
face of mounting scientific evidence]{.underline} and wide consensus
about the dangerous consequences of climate change to the planet's
biosphere and human societies. [Critics of negotiators' ineffectiveness
typically fault the economic interests]{.underline} of carbon emitting
countries in maintaining a global energy and economic system that
benefits them. [They seldom attribute COP meeting failures to the
enduring power of gender privilege]{.underline}. Buckingham, however,
sees a more gendered COP landscape marked by the gendered culture and
approach of male negotiators. To bolster this critique, she reports
[consistent research findings supporting improved decision making in
economic and political settings where women are included in adequate
numbers]{.underline}. Not surprisingly, [this research is ignored by
predominately male representatives]{.underline} who dominate the ranks
of COP representatives (women comprise less than thirty percent of COP
delegates). This is despite the fact that in 1995 the United Nations
called for including women in all levels of environmental decision
making. Buckingham's conclusion: "[there is enough evidence now to
justify increasing women's involvement in decision-making on climate
change.]{.underline} We should do so without delay." [It is not simply
their gender]{.underline} that accounts for the poor track record of the
mainly male negotiators; [it also is the interests that they
represent]{.underline}. If women representatives replaced some or all of
the men at these meetings, would agreements be reached, GHG levels
reduced, and the dangers of climate change averted? It would be an
interesting experiment, and simply on the ethical grounds of gender
equity, it warrants mandating equal gender representation at all COP
meetings and other United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC)--sponsored bodies and activities, including the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. [Gender parity]{.underline},
however, [would not change the national and economic
interests]{.underline} dominating COP meetings. Whether they are men or
women from the global North or South, representatives at COP meetings
typically represent elite [interests. Women might bring a different
experiential and gendered perspective to the negotiations, but they
still would face institutional resistance to change]{.underline},
especially by a UN system historically run by elite men. [This is partly
because gender is not only a feature of individuals. Gendered cultures,
practices, and networks characterize organizations as well.]{.underline}

#### Especially true when looking at their [solvency mechanism]{.underline}, their usage of the DoD cements a [masculine framework]{.underline} for solutions, their policies are built around supporting the [military]{.underline}, not fixing the [climate crisis]{.underline} 

**Nagel 15**(Joane, Social and Behavioral Sciences -- Sociology
Professor, "Gender, Conflict, and the Militarization of Climate Change
Policy", CS)

A preponderance of largely [male governments and male-dominated economic
interests]{.underline} protecting the unequal status quo [can be
understood mainly as hindrances to successful climate
negotiations]{.underline}. But [they are not the only important gendered
features]{.underline} of the international system [responsible for
influencing climate change policy]{.underline}. As we saw above, [the
military is another gendered institution intimately related to national
governments and economies]{.underline}. National [militaries are less
responsible for stalling organized responses to climate change; they are
critical articulators of climate change hazards and advocates for
defining climate change as a problem]{.underline} not of controlling
carbon emissions, but [of protecting national security.]{.underline}
Despite the end of the Cold War (characterized by a large-scale
U.S.--USSR arms race) in 1990, in 2010 world military expenditures were
higher than in any year since the end of the Second World War in 1945.
The United States far outpaces other countries in military expenditures.
The U.S. accounted for thirty-nine percent of global military
expenditures in 2012, when military expenditures consumed more than four
percent of the U.S. gross domestic product. [The United States is among
a handful of the most militarized countries in the world]{.underline},
as measured by military expenditures per capita, including Israel, South
Sudan, Saudi Arabia, North Korea, Russia, Jordan, Algeria, and
Azerbaijan. Even the world's poorest countries sport national armies
whose weapons and training are subsidized by or purchased from the
world's major arms dealers, most notably the United States, Russia,
France, the United Kingdom, and China. The world's [militaries are
historically hyper-masculine institutions]{.underline} with cultures
embracing honor, bravery, loyalty, strength, and violence. [Men
dominate]{.underline} the [ranks and leadership of military
institutions]{.underline} just as they dominate national politics and
economics around the world. In the United States, the [military plays a
critical role in]{.underline} scientific research, including [climate
change research.]{.underline} The U.S. Department of Defense [(DOD) has
a basic scientific research and development budget that is two and a
half times greater than the]{.underline} National Science Foundation
([NSF]{.underline})---the agency tasked with funding basic research
across the sciences, mathematics, and engineering. The NSF has a broad
mission of supporting transformative research on all topics and issues
across disciplines. [The DOD's]{.underline} much narrower [mission is to
protect national security]{.underline}. [This focus on
security]{.underline}---food security, energy security, water security,
and environmental security---[determines the research projects it
supports]{.underline}. As a result, [the DOD has been a powerful voice
in emphasizing national security dangers from and defenses against
climate change and in shaping the work of the many researchers it
supports]{.underline} in universities, industry, and national labs and
research facilities. [The DOD's agenda reflects classical
military/masculine tactics for attacking climate change: large-scale
geo-engineering approaches to manage solar radiation or sequester
carbon, energy research focused on military missions, conflict scenario
planning, climate forecasting and modeling, and global resource
assessments. The DOD has]{.underline} very [limited interest in
funding]{.underline} "softer" ([feminine) research topics on the health,
social, racial, gender, or age disparities in climate change impacts,
factors that promote community resilience in the face of disasters, or
strategies for reducing the carbon emissions causing climate
change.]{.underline}

### Fem IR K -- AT: Scenario Planning 

#### [Modern war]{.underline} uses narratives of [beautiful]{.underline} and [helpless]{.underline} women to justify [atrocious acts]{.underline}, only a [feminist critique]{.underline} of war theory can reveal the [deep flaws]{.underline} in IR theory

**Sjoberg 08**(Laura, American feminist scholar of international
relations and international security and Global Professor of Politics
and International Relations at Royal Holloway University of London, "Why
Just War Needs Feminism Now More Than Ever", CS)

Feminists argue that the [construction of women as 'beautiful souls' at
once serves as moral justification for war-fighting]{.underline}
stronger than the underlying jus ad bellum standards (protecting
innocent women and children), [obscures women's actual suffering in
war]{.underline} (given the moral reliance of war-fighting on women's
being shielded from the actions and effects of war), [and props up
gender subordination more generally]{.underline} (by limiting women's
capabilities inside war and supporting gender differentiation in
citizenship status and other social roles). As such, [the just war
tradition's reliance on gendered ideal-types in the non-combatant
immunity principle has real negative impacts, both inside and outside of
the making of war]{.underline}. The gender subordination that just war
theory perpetrates is another problem to add to the laundry list of
difficulties that the tradition has as it looks for current
applicability. [Not only does a gender-based critique of the just war
tradition demonstrate gender bias in the just war tradition, but also
reveals that just war theory often fails on its own terms because of
that gender bias]{.underline} (Sjoberg, 2006b). This demonstrates that
just [war's difficulties cannot be solved by simply adding new rules for
new sorts of war; broader problems exist. A feminist critique of just
war theory reveals important ways forward, and suggests broader
solutions]{.underline}. This paper argues [that a gender-based critique
and reformulation of just war theory can suggest an agenda for the
reinvention of the tradition in a sharper, more relevant
form.]{.underline} Before proceeding to that reformulation, perhaps a
note on the method by which one draws gender-based critique is
appropriate. Feminist scholars study global politics through 'gendered
lenses', where gender as an evaluative and constitutive variable frames
their analysis of global politics (Peterson and Runyan, 1999). [When
looking through gendered lenses, feminists are concerned with the
influence of gender subordination in global politics and interested in
paths to redress that subordination]{.underline}. As Jill Steans notes,
'[feminist critical theorists are trying to find a way forward which
retains both gender as a category of analysis and retain the historical
commitment to the emancipator project in feminism' while addressing
broader policy issues across state and cultural boundaries]{.underline}
(Steans, 1998, 29). [A feminist critique of the just war tradition,
then, looks for locations of gender subordination within the foundations
of just war theory, and then uses gender as a category of analysis to
search for emancipatory alternatives.]{.underline}

### Fem IR K -- Turns War

#### [Feminist]{.underline} perspective solves the most [serious impacts]{.underline} of war

**Sjoberg 08**(Laura, American feminist scholar of international
relations and international security and Global Professor of Politics
and International Relations at Royal Holloway University of London, "Why
Just War Needs Feminism Now More Than Ever", CS)

Through gendered lenses, we can see a number of guidelines for the
reinterpretation of these standards. First, [a feminist perspective
would argue that the question of just cause is one that should not be
decided by any one actor or from any one epistemological perspective or
political standpoint.]{.underline} Instead, in keeping with strong
objectivity[, justice needs to be considered dialogically.]{.underline}
Additionally, [feminists' interest in empathy would mean that potential
belligerents should]{.underline}, in the dialogue about the meaning of
justice, [attempt not only to comprehend but also to emotionally
identify with the positions of the other actors]{.underline} in the
dialogue. [An ethic of care demands that the planning and fighting of
wars be done with a special concern for the plight of those
traditionally marginalized in social and political life]{.underline}. A
[care-based politics of war-making demands that states and/or other
political actors refrain from fighting wars that will not mainly impact
those people against whom those actors have just cause. It also suggests
that calculations of the 'civilian damage' of war include a broader
range of human insecuritie]{.underline}s, including issues like
unemployment, debt, transportation damage, health infrastructure damage,
and the like (Tickner, 1992). Along the same lines, [a gender
perspective suggests a broader group of situations that just war theory
should be used to analyze]{.underline}. These include any situations
where conflict is likely to cause mass human insecurity, including
economic sanctions, civil conflicts, and/or religious or cultural
oppression. The source of these observations is feminist work on the
continuity of violence in international politics. Twenty years ago,
Betty Reardon called the international political arena a 'war system',
indicating that constant political violence, economic deprivation,
gender and cultural subordination, and environmental destruction are a
structural feature of people's (and especially women's) lives in global
politics (1985). Chris Cuomo followed up, arguing that [war 'is not just
an event' and instead can be seen as a continuous property of global
politics (]{.underline}1996). These insights demonstrate [that a
feminist approach to war]{.underline}, and its moral consequences,
[differs substantively from conventional just war
approaches.]{.underline} As such, [a feminist perspective suggests
several foundational principles for a reformulated just war tradition,
less totalizing but more honest about its capacities, less deterministic
but more prepared to deal with the contingency of today's international
conflicts]{.underline}: (1) A dialogue about the meaning of justice for
just cause, inclusive of a broad array of international actors and
aiming at building consensus through empathetic cooperation. (2)
Emotional identification as a major component of international relations
in times of conflict. (3) An ad bellum prescription that an actor should
not engage a war, no matter how just the cause, that cannot be fought
mainly against those who have created the just cause. (4) Special
attention to the impacts of war on those traditionally marginalized in
social and political life, especially women. (5) A new, more sensitive
principle of discrimination, which acknowledges the terrible civilian
damages caused by war, and calculates not only the immediate effects of
guns and bombs, but also the lasting human effects of conflict and
violence. (6) [A modified, 'war system' approach to those situations
that should be covered by just war analysis that covers the most intense
sources of humaninflicted human insecurity, even outside of the
traditional confines of 'war'.]{.underline}

#### Older [models]{.underline} and [justifications]{.underline} for waging war no longer hold up, a [feminist lens]{.underline} provides these theories with [empathy]{.underline} and [morality]{.underline}, making conflict increasingly [avoidable]{.underline} 

**Sjoberg 08**(Laura, American feminist scholar of international
relations and international security and Global Professor of Politics
and International Relations at Royal Holloway University of London, "Why
Just War Needs Feminism Now More Than Ever", CS)

In a world where there are as many just war theories as there are just
war theorists, yet massively destructive wars take place, [just war
theory needs both focused moral priorities and some way to regulate
meaning without excluding perspectives]{.underline}. Because excluding
perspectives is likely to increase, rather than decrease, the number and
intensity of international conflicts; [just war cannot regulate meaning
either by imposing some actors' meanings on others or by giving way to
absolute relativism]{.underline}. Instead, [an approach to meaning that
is both communicative and empathetic has a number of distinct
advantages]{.underline}. First, [it demands that parties in a conflict
listen to their opponents' and third parties' understandings of the
meaning of justice.]{.underline} [Listening can be a first step to
overcoming conflicts.]{.underline} Second, [it requires that parties
reconsider the claimed universalism of their understandings of global
politics. This could inspire less myopic understandings of security
states, transgressing realism as a selffulfilling prophecy]{.underline}.
Third, [the element of emotional identification adds an important
additional layer to listening. In empathetic cooperation,]{.underline}
actors not only have to 'hear' other states' positions, but are also
asked to attempt to understand on rational and emotional levels.
Finally, [attention to the political margins is important, and
long-neglected, in the analysis of the ethics of war]{.underline}. The
21st century has seen a number of international political conflicts that
are increasingly violent and increasingly difficult to analyze using
traditional just war standards. Where just war theory used to be able to
find a state that made war, the war on terrorism has made obvious the
relevance of non-state actors to war-making. Where just war theory used
to be able to talk about noncombatant identification and immunity,
guerilla wars, air wars, and wars against an unidentified enemy have
complicated the discrimination principle. Where just war used to be able
to confine itself to the cultural context of the belligerents, an
increasingly global world sees conflicts between cultural contexts. [In
such an international political atmosphere, political leaders need an
ethical compass to war-making and war-fighting now more than
ever]{.underline}. In the face of this increasing need for a moral
compass, [political leaders find a just war tradition that struggles
with being outdated, risks susceptibility to political manipulation,
lacks clarity in conceptual understandings of justice and war, and
entrenches gender subordination in global politics. Just war needs a
unifying motivating morality that allows for both diversity and
decisionmaking]{.underline}. The feminist reformulated just war
principles contained in this article provide the groundwork for such a
motivating morality. [Just war needs a way to adapt to cultural
pluralism; feminist empathy constructs a workable dialogue. Just war
needs a way to adapt to the constant challenge of technological change;
feminisms center their moral thinking on the lives of individuals and
thus provide a framework for thinking about new technologies. Just war
needs a way to pay attention to the structural violence and human
security effects of infrastructural attacks and aerial wars. Feminisms'
focus on political marginality helps just war to see this suffering, and
to prioritize it in ethical evaluation]{.underline}. From the top levels
of strategic policy-making to the margins of political life, people need
just war theory now more than ever. Because people need just war theory,
just war theory needs feminism.

### Fem IR K -- NATO Bad

#### NATO is an instrument of hegemonic masculinity\-\--their threat construction and rhetoric of nation-states recreates the impacts they seek to prevent because the masculine will *always* seek more enemies to securitize and otherize

**Cockburn 10** (Cynthia Cockburn, feminist researcher and writer and
Visiting Professor in Sociology at City University London, 9-20-2010,
"Women-against-NATO -- Making a Feminist Case", War Resisters'
International, Accessed 7-19-2022,
<https://wri-irg.org/en/story/2010/women-against-nato-making-feminist-case>
)//kpt

In April 2009, as part of the mobilization against the NATO Summit in
Strasbourg, No-to-NATO organized a two-day counter-conference, in the
course of which some forty women from NATO member states held a workshop
on 'a feminist case against NATO'.\[1\] Some of us have continued to
work together by e-mail, and we hope to mark the forthcoming NATO Summit
in Lisbon, Portugal, this November, with women's protest actions.

What is our '[feminist case' against NATO]{.underline}? In many ways
it's the same case we make against militarism and war in general. That's
to say, we note the [adverse]{.underline} ways they [impact on
women]{.underline}, and [the damaging gender]{.underline} roles, active
and passive, into which they draw both sexes. We [point up the fact that
gender relations]{.underline}, as we know and live them, [are relations
of power and inequality, founded in violence]{.underline}. They
[involve]{.underline} the [social construction of]{.underline}
[masculinity as combative]{.underline}. Proper [manhood
requires]{.underline} a [readiness to use force in defence of
'honour']{.underline}, while [femininity]{.underline} [is]{.underline}
[associated with passivity]{.underline} and victimhood. Women who want
to escape the feminine stereotype have little choice but to imitate the
masculine model. This [**dichotomous gender culture** is]{.underline}
one of the long-term, [**underlying**, **causes of war**]{.underline},
because it [predisposes]{.underline} our [societies to see taking up
arms as a normal and]{.underline} acceptable way of dealing with
political conflicts. Consequently, [feminist activists call for the
transformation of gender relations as]{.underline} a
[necessary]{.underline} element of the movement [to end
war]{.underline}.

So how does this apply in the struggle against NATO? It's important to
stress that, for sure, all the women on our 'Women Against NATO' e-list
are making exactly the same base-line case as all other opponents of
NATO. Briefly, that **[NATO]{.underline}** is a Cold War instrument that
should have been closed down when the Warsaw Pact folded; that it is
[primarily a vehicle for the economic and military interests of the
USA]{.underline} and to a lesser extent those of the post-colonial
Western European states; and that its [current strategy of]{.underline}
enlargement and its [increasingly '**expeditionary' mode make it a
growing threat to peace**]{.underline} on a global scale. Furthermore,
[NATO's existence flouts international law and United Nations
principles]{.underline}; it chimes with [increasing militarization of
the European Union]{.underline}; and it locks member states into the
nuclear weapons and MDI systems on which the USA continues to insist.

However, [beyond]{.underline} this [general critique of
NATO,]{.underline} [we perceive the alliance in gendered
terms]{.underline}. [**NATO** is a massive **military alliance of nation
states**]{.underline}. Nira Yuval-Davis and other [feminist theorists
have shown how the **concept of**]{.underline} **'[nation' is
gendered]{.underline}**[, how **nationalism** **and patriarchy are**
**interlocked**, and how nations and nationalists use and exploit
'women']{.underline}. [NATO is the product of Cold War
thinking]{.underline} that [**saw** the **globe** **as divided into**
two '**blocs'**]{.underline} of nation states, [champions of rival
ideologies]{.underline}. Some [feminist contributions]{.underline} to
the Strasbourg workshop [talked about the]{.underline} '[patriarchal
logic' of blocs]{.underline}, a [**brotherhood** of nations]{.underline}
in arms [**seeking**]{.underline} out [**fantasy**
**enemies**]{.underline} long [**after**]{.underline} the [**Cold War**
has ended.]{.underline}

Secondly, women have been making a feminist case against NATO's military
bases, installations and production facilities in our countries.
Although, for the most part, these belong to the national armed forces
of member states, they are in effect part and parcel of NATO resources
in Europe. Several women wrote workshop papers about the damaging effect
of military installations on the lives of women in neighbouring
communities. They described women's non-violent direct action outside
the razor wire and security checkpoints, protesting against the toxic
pollution, the danger of radiation, the noise and blighted areas
entailed by the military use of land. [Women]{.underline} also
[protest]{.underline} against [sexual exploitation and violence against
women by military personnel]{.underline}. In [Bosnia and
Koso]{.underline}vo, UN and [NATO-led forces]{.underline} not only
[generated]{.underline} a [massive sex industry]{.underline}, but
individual soldiers -- along with NATO contractors and UN police -- were
actively involved in the trafficking process, receiving trafficked women
and girls at borders, [smuggling them into military bases]{.underline}
and acting as pimps. Although NATO adopted, in 2004, a Policy Against
Human Trafficking, no suspected NATO traffickers have been
prosecuted.\[2\]

Third, the [persistence of the 'NATO system']{.underline} after the
collapse of the Soviet Union has [prevented]{.underline} each
[European]{.underline} [country cashing in 'the peace dividend' by
reducing]{.underline} its [armed forces and humanizing its international
posture]{.underline}. It has [required]{.underline} them to sustain [a
**high degree** **of** **militarization**]{.underline} that masculinizes
and deforms everyday life. It has, what's more, fostered the
militarization of the European Union, so that an economic alliance we
joined as a guarantor of cooperation and harmony is turning into yet
another war-fighting machine. It has been argued that the EU is
converting to this 'hard' image in response to the chiding of US
policy-makers that Europe is a feminine, soft, civilian power. European
leaders want to play 'with the big boys'.\[3\] A [commitment to
contribute to a European force as well as to NATO **calls for high
military expenditures**]{.underline} in EU member states. [Feminists
argue that]{.underline} this [**drains funds from the education, health
and housing services** badly needed by women]{.underline}, the sex that
still carries a very high proportion of the burden of domestic life and
care.

Finally, [feminist antimilitarists make a case against NATO as a
perpetrator of wars]{.underline}. The effects of war are dramatically
gendered. There is a growing trend to civilian casualties,
disproportionately women and their dependants. [Women are the majority
of]{.underline} the [displaced and refugees]{.underline}, [trying to
maintain their families]{.underline} in impossible circumstances.
Thousands are widowed, deprived of a viable existence[. Sexual violence
redoubles in and after war. We see all this in NATO's war in
Afghanistan.]{.underline}

Improbable as it may seem, [NATO prides itself on 'mainstreaming' gender
into its structures and activities]{.underline}. '[NATO]{.underline} and
its Partners', [they say]{.underline} on their website, ['are promoting
the role of women within NATO-led operations and missions']{.underline}
and [increasing]{.underline} the [knowledge and skills available on
'gender and diversity']{.underline}. Last year the Strategic Commands
received guidelines for the integration into the NATO Command Structure
of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on 'Women, Peace and Security'.
There is a NATO Office on Gender Perspectives, and gender advisers have
been appointed. An implementation report is to be published in time for
the Lisbon Summit.\[4\]

[Given]{.underline} the [implications for women of NATO's campaign
Afghanistan]{.underline}, the [Alliance's self-professed
gender]{.underline} sensitivity can only deepen feminist cynicism about
'gender [mainstreaming']{.underline}. Here is an [alliance of
powerful]{.underline} Western [states exploiting the notion of
'liberating Afghan women from oppression by the Taliban' as]{.underline}
one of its [devious justifications for invading the
country]{.underline}. [Women's insecurity is multiplied in the
chaos]{.underline} and brutality [of]{.underline} a decade of [armed
conflict]{.underline}. Then the [intruders announce plans to make their
escape by negotiating the re-entry to power of -- the
Taliban]{.underline}. Afghan women certainly have a feminist case
against NATO. So do women in NATO member states.

#### NATO functions as an institution of hegemonic masculinity\-\--the narrative of military "teaching" and "training" reinforces the Western role of the masculine protector

Politics at Newcastle University, 4-18-2022, "Challenging civil society

NATO as an institution of international hegemonic masculinity: method
and approach

[**NATO** is]{.underline} a [political-military alliance built
on]{.underline} consensus decision-making. Moving beyond its [Cold War
origins]{.underline}, the [alliance's]{.underline} remit has
[**expanded**]{.underline} significantly [**beyond**]{.underline} a
[sole focus on **collective defence to include**]{.underline} crisis
management and **[cooperative security]{.underline}**. This has seen
[NATO's]{.underline} [focus]{.underline} [enlarge]{.underline}
[from]{.underline} [a regional one to a global]{.underline}
[one]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} recent [engagements
in]{.underline} [Afghanistan, Libya and Kosovo]{.underline}, for
example. Its [status as a multilateral]{.underline}
[institution]{.underline} means it [is]{.underline} limited by its
members' priorities and therefore [sensitive not to implicate NATO or
NATO member states in wrongdoing]{.underline} ([Hebert,
2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00108367221084561)).

In [centring **NATO** as an '**institution of international hegemonic
masculinity'**]{.underline} ([Wright et al.,
2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00108367221084561)),
in this analysis, it is possible to shed light on the peculiarities of
NATO's WPS work to date, against which engagement with civil society
takes place. This has [two co-constituting elements]{.underline},
[first]{.underline}, internally, [**existing gender norms** and
expectations of masculinity and femininity **reflective** **of** a
**hierarchical military institution** are (re)created and (**re)enforced
through NATO's engagement**]{.underline} with WPS ([Wright et al.,
2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00108367221084561):
71). For example, men [working]{.underline} on WPS at NATO navigate both
the trivialisation and the feminisation of such work and must
(re)negotiate their own identities. Yet in so doing they
[reinforce]{.underline} [the importance of men]{.underline} [speaking to
and listening to other men]{.underline} (rather than women) [reinforcing
the gendered status quo]{.underline} ([Wright et al.,
2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00108367221084561):
93; see also [Hurley,
2018a](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00108367221084561)).

Second, externally, [as a transnational military alliance, **NATO**
**acts as a**]{.underline} **['teaching machine']{.underline}** in which
member and partner states learn the value of WPS as a 'military tool'
through socialisation with each other ([Wright et al.,
2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00108367221084561);
see also [Enloe,
1981](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00108367221084561)).
This [means **perpetuating** an understanding]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} [WPS]{.underline} [as a means to support operational
effectiveness]{.underline} [through]{.underline} '[**the role of
masculinist protector which reinforces** **hegemonic militaristic**,
masculine **ideals** and norms']{.underline} ([Wright et al.,
2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00108367221084561):
34). This patriarchal [logic **puts**]{.underline} '[**women** and
children, **in a subordinate position** **of dependence and obedience'**
**to justify** the waging of]{.underline} **[war]{.underline}** ([Young,
2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00108367221084561):
2), for [example]{.underline}, [**NATO's** **intervention** in
Afghanistan]{.underline} ([Wright,
2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00108367221084561)).
It is [**reinforced through**]{.underline} the stories
[**NATO**]{.underline} tells internally about its WPS engagement
([Hurley,
2018b](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00108367221084561))
and externally in [**public diplomacy**]{.underline} ([Wright,
2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00108367221084561))
and to support partnerships with other states but also celebrities
([Wright and Bergman Rosamond,
2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00108367221084561))
and now civil society. Thus, [**interrogating**]{.underline} civil
society [**perceptions of NATO**]{.underline} in this context
[**adds**]{.underline} an additional [dimension to **understanding how
NATO seeks to legitimise itself**]{.underline} as a WPS actor, further
[constituting]{.underline} its [role as an institution of international
hegemonic masculinity.]{.underline}

#### Their focus on NATO security cooperation and governance justifies further interventionism in the name of a greater global good

**Ruohonen 14** (Anna Ruohonen, Master's thesis for University of
Lapland, Spring 2014, "Gendering NATO -- A Feminist Analysis Of a
Military Organization", Lauda,

2.3. Gender, Development, Security

[NATO uses feminist rhetoric of women's rights, and that rhetoric of
women's rights is used simultaneously with the rhetoric of peace and
stability]{.underline}. The **[adaptation of feminist
rhetoric]{.underline}** is misleading in that sense that it [is **used**
more **as a justification** **of the operation** than it is used for
helping the women in the country in question]{.underline}. As the
examples show, the [aim is rather promoting peace, good governance and
development than improving the conditions in targeted
country]{.underline}. Johanna Valenius discusses peacekeeping as her
object of study in the United Nations. According to the UN, peacekeeping
today has evolved and expanded from the peacekeeping of the first forty
years of the UN: "while it once emphasized monitoring and observing by
military personnel, peacekeeping today can include many components,
among them military, civilian police, civil affairs, elections, refugee
return, humanitarian relief, demining, nation-building and human
rights". According to NATO's definition of crisis management (NATO
2012), the only difference between the two is the military component,
which can be done under the name of crisis management but not under UN's
definition of peacekeeping. In case of NATO, Afghanistan is a place
where the purpose of the military is twofold: it is supposed to engage
with 'the war on terror' simultaneously when it engages with
peacekeeping efforts. This [relationship between war and **peace
promotion is paradoxical to the organization** but also for the people
"attacked" or "protected" by the forces]{.underline} (Kronsell 2012, 3)

Engaging women in security work, reconstruction and stabilization is
central to achieving international objectives in Afghanistan
(Publication 5, 3).

[Women remain]{.underline} nonetheless too often [excluded from taking
part in maintaining]{.underline}, [restoring, and defending
stability]{.underline}. Their victimisation in conflict situation and
[**marginalisation in peace** building efforts]{.underline} continue to
[have **profound impact on** global **security**]{.underline} (Text 4).

Gender issues have been on the peacekeeping/crisis management agenda
approximately three decades. It seems that [when military conflicts and
crises become more and more complex, more is required from international
crisis management to transform and work effectively]{.underline}. As a
result of Resolution 1325, [states and militaries have implemented
gender policies in the]{.underline} [name of efficiency]{.underline},
which has very often [led to an essentialist notion of sex and
gender]{.underline} (DeGroot 2001; Valenius 2007b; Simic 2010).
According to Elina Penttinen, the need for a more comprehensive approach
in security stems from the situation during the Kosovo intervention when
NATO had to take on a number of humanitarian tasks that they were not
prepared for in advance (Penttinen 2013, 49).

[To place]{.underline} the [gender policy agenda in a wider perspective
is to valuate it in]{.underline} [relation to the aims of state building
and reconstruction more generally]{.underline}. According to Jens
Stilhoff Sörensen, the [**global liberal governance** **and state
building contribute to** **social**]{.underline} [and spatial
**fragmentation**, not to reconciliation]{.underline} and
re-integration. It does so by dismantling previously existing frameworks
and introducing market relations, where the state has limited
instruments for attracting cross-sectarian loyalty, and through divisive
biopolitics in both "soft" measures, like promoting civil society
(Sörnesen 2012, 49). [**Liberalism** **appears** as an ethos of
government that aims **to govern** **by promoting freedom**, and that
freedom is conceptualized in certain ways]{.underline}. The
**[rhetoric]{.underline}** is not statecentric, but [**takes**
**people** **as** its]{.underline} **[objective]{.underline}**. The
[process is not to manage]{.underline} the [risks]{.underline}
[on]{.underline} an [individual level]{.underline}, but **[by
securing]{.underline}** the **[people most identifiable as
civilian]{.underline}** [population]{.underline},
**[women]{.underline}** **[and children]{.underline}**. [In]{.underline}
the case of [NATO, women and children **are** **considered** as
**objects**]{.underline}. I will return to the "womenandchildren" in the
following paragraph. According to Linnèa Gelot and Fredrik Söderbaum,
the [problem of **intervention** **cannot** **be divorced from** its
external **political origins**]{.underline} (Gelot and Söderbaum 2012,
131). [Global interventions]{.underline} by international actors [are
**justified in the name of** the "**global** **good**".]{.underline} For
example in Afghanistan, [humanitarian intervention is presented not only
as a way of ending lethal conflict, but also as a means of "getting
politics right" in the aftermath of war]{.underline} (Gelot and
Söderbaum 2012, 132). Gelot and Söderbaum claim that the [fundamental
problem]{.underline} of this [is]{.underline} that 'the [**global
good'** is **often**]{.underline} taken as [**synonymous** **with** "the
**liberal peace**" **or** as **neoliberal "good
governance**",]{.underline} and the **[supposed fruits of
intervention]{.underline}** [(stable/constitutional rule, macroeconomic
stability, "good governance", law and order) are **connected** **with
the neoliberal project**]{.underline} (Gelot and Söderbaum 2012,
132--133).

The visit underlined the fundamental principle that the [protection of
human rights -- including women's rights]{.underline}
--[represents]{.underline} an [essential]{.underline} [driver toward
lasting stability]{.underline} in Afghanistan (News No. 8).

#### The alternative is the indigenous/neolithic model

[Industrial civilization is on a **collision course** with life
itself]{.underline}. Facilitating its collapse is a deserved and
welcomed correction, long overdue. [**Collapse is inevitable** whether
we seek to facilitate it or not.]{.underline} Nonetheless, whatever we
do, [industrial civilization, based as it is on mining and burning
finite and polluting fossil fuels, cannot last]{.underline} because it
is destroying the ecosystem and the basis of local, cooperative life
itself. [It knows no limits in a physically finite world and thus is
unsustainable]{.underline}. And the numbers of our human species on
earth, which have proliferated from 1.6 billion in 1900 to 7 billion
today, is the consequence of mindlessly eating oil -- tractors,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides -- while destroying human culture in
the process. [Our food system itself **is not
sustainable**]{.underline}. [Dramatic die-off is part of the inevitable
correction in the very near future, whether we like it or
not.]{.underline} Human and political culture has become totally
subservient to a near religion of economics and market forces.
[Technologies are **never neutral**]{.underline}, with some being
seriously detrimental. [Technologies come with an intrinsic character
representing the purposes and values of the prevailing political economy
that births it]{.underline}. [**The Industrialism process itself** is
traumatic.]{.underline} It is likely that [only when we experience an
apprenticeship in nature can we be trusted with machines,]{.underline}
especially when they capital intensive & complicated. The nation-state,
intertwined more than ever with corporate industrialism, will always
come to its aid and rescue. [Withdrawal of popular support enables new
imagination and energy for re-creating local human food sufficient
communities conforming with bioregional limits]{.underline}. [II. The
United States of America is **irredeemable and unreformable**, a Pretend
Society]{.underline}. [The USA]{.underline} as a nation state, as a
recent culture, [is irredeemable, unreformable, an
anti-democratic]{.underline}, vertical, [over-sized imperial
unmanageable monster]{.underline}, sustained by the obedience and
cooperation, even if reluctant, of the vast majority of its
non-autonomous population. [Virtually all of us are complicit in this
**imperial plunder**]{.underline} even as many of us are increasingly
repulsed by it and speak out against it. Lofty
**[rhetoric]{.underline}** [has conditioned us to believe
in]{.underline} our [national exceptionalism,]{.underline} despite it
being dramatically at odds with the empirically revealed pattern of our
plundering cultural behavior totally dependent upon outsourcing the pain
and suffering elsewhere. [We cling to living a life based on the
**social myth** of]{.underline} US [America being committed to justice
for all]{.underline}, even as we increasingly know this has always
served as a cover for the social secret that the US is committed to
prosperity for a minority thru expansion at ANY cost. [Our Eurocentric
origins have been built on]{.underline} an extraordinary and forceful
but [rationalized dispossession of **hundreds of Indigenous
nations**]{.underline} [(a genocide) assuring acquisition of free land,
murdering millions with total impunity]{.underline}. [This still
unaddressed crime against humanity assured that our eyes themselves are
the wool]{.underline}. Our addiction to the comfort and convenience
brought to us by centuries of forceful theft of land, labor, and
resources is very difficult to break, as with any addiction. However,
**[our survival]{.underline}**, and healing, [requires a commitment to
recovery of our humanity]{.underline}, [ceasing our obedience to the
national state]{.underline}. This is the (r)evolution begging us.
Original wool is in our eyes: Eurocentric values were established with
the invasion by Columbus: Cruelty never before seen, nor heard of, nor
read of -- Bartolome de las Casas describing the behavior of the
Spaniards inflicted on the Indigenous of the West Indies in the 1500s.
In fact the Indigenous had no vocabulary words to describe the behavior
inflicted on them (A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies,
1552). [Eurocentric racism (]{.underline}hatred driven by fear)
[and]{.underline} arrogant religious [ethnocentrism]{.underline}
(self-righteous superiority) [have never been]{.underline} honestly
[addressed]{.underline} or overcome. Thus, **[our foundational
values]{.underline}** and behaviors[, if not]{.underline} **[radically
transformed]{.underline}** from arrogance to caring[, will prove fatal
to our]{.underline} modern [species]{.underline}. Wool has remained
uncleansed from our eyes: I personally discovered the continued vigorous
U.S. application of the "Columbus Enterprise" in Viet Nam, discovering
that Viet Nam was no aberration after learning of more than 500 previous
US military interventions beginning in the late 1790s. Our business is
killing, and business is good was a slogan painted on the front of a 9th
Infantry Division helicopter in Viet Nam's Mekong Delta in 1969. We, not
the Indigenous, were and remain the savages. The US has been built on
three genocides: violent and arrogant dispossession of hundreds of
Indigenous nations in North America (Genocide #1), and in Africa
(Genocide #2), stealing land and labor, respectively, with total
impunity, murdering and maiming millions, amounting to genocide. [It is
morally]{.underline} unsustainable, now [ecologically]{.underline},
politically, [economically]{.underline}, and socially
[unsustainable]{.underline} as well. [Further, in the 20th Century, the
Republic of the US intervened several hundred times in well over a
hundred nations stealing resources and labor, while imposing US-friendly
markets, killing millions, impoverishing perhaps billions (Genocide #3).
Since 1798, the US military forces have militarily intervened over 560
times in dozens of nations, nearly 400 of which have occurred since
World War II]{.underline}. And [since WWII, the US has bombed **28
countries**,]{.underline} while covertly intervening thousands of times
in the majority of nations on the earth. It is not helpful to continue
believing in the social myth that the USA is a society committed to
justice for all , in fact a convenient mask (since our origins) of our
social secret being a society committed to prosperity for a few through
expansion at ANY cost. (See William Appleman Williams). Always
possessing oligarchic tendencies, it is now an outright corrupt
corporatocracy owned lock stock and barrel by big money made obscenely
rich from war making with our consent, even if reluctant. The Cold War
and its nuclear and conventional arms race with the exaggerated "red
menace", was an insidious cover for a war preserving the Haves from the
Have-Nots, in effect, ironically preserving a western, consumptive way
of life that itself is killing us. Pretty amazing[! Our way of life has
produced so much carbon in the water, soil, and atmosphere, that it may
in the end be equivalent to having caused nuclear winter]{.underline}.
The war OF wholesale terror on retail [terror has replaced the "red
menace" as the rhetorical justification for the continued imperial
plunder of the earth and the riches it brings to the
military-industrial-intelligence-congressional-executive-information
complex]{.underline}. Our [cooperation with]{.underline} and addiction
to the [American Way Of Life provides]{.underline} the [political energy
that guarantees]{.underline} continuation of U.S. polices of **[imperial
plunder]{.underline}**. III. The American Way Of Life (AWOL), and [the
Western Way of Life]{.underline} in general, **[is the most dangerous
force that exists on the earth]{.underline}**. [Our]{.underline}
insatiable [consumption patterns on a finite earth,]{.underline} enabled
by but a one-century blip in burning energy efficient liquid fossil
fuels, have made virtually all of us addicted to our way of life as we
have been conditioned to be in denial about the egregious consequences
outsourced outside our view or feeling fields. Of course, this trend
began 2 centuries earlier with the advent of the industrial revolution.
With 4.6% of the world's population, [we consume]{.underline} anywhere
from 25% to [nearly half the world's resources]{.underline}. This kind
of theft can only occur by force or its threat, justifying it with noble
sounding rhetoric, over and over and over. Our insatiable individual and
collective human demands for energy inputs originating from outside our
bioregions, furnish the political-economic profit motives for the energy
extractors, which in turn own the political process obsessed with
preserving "national (in)security", e.g., maintaining a very class-based
life of affluence and comfort for a minority of the world's people.
This, in turn, requires a huge military to assure control of resources
for our use, protecting corporate plunder, and to eliminate perceived
threats from competing political agendas. The U.S. War department's
policy of "full spectrum dominance" is intended to control the world's
seas, airspaces, land bases, outer spaces, our "inner" mental spaces,
and cyberspaces. Resources everywhere are constantly needed to supply
our delusional modern life demands on a finite planet as the system
seeks to dumb us down ever more. Thus, we are terribly complicit in the
current [severe dilemmas coming to a head]{.underline} due to (1)
climate instability largely caused by mindless human activities; (2)
from our dependence upon national currencies; and (3) dependence upon
rapidly depleting finite resources. We have become addicts in a
classical sense. [Recovery requires]{.underline} a deep psychological,
spiritual, and physical commitment to break our addiction to
materialism, as we embark on a radical healing journey, individually and
collectively, where less and local becomes a mantra, as does sharing and
caring, I call it [the Neolithic or Indigenous model]{.underline}.
[Sharing and caring replace individualism and competition. Therefore, A
Radical Prescription Understanding]{.underline} [these facts requires a
radical paradigmatic shift in our thinking and behavior, equivalent to
an evolutionary shift in our epistemology where our knowledge/thinking
framework]{.underline} shifts: arrogant separateness from and domination
over nature (ending a post-Ice Age 10,000 year cycle of thought
structure among moderns) morphs to integration with nature, i.e., an
eco-consciousness felt deeply in the viscera, more powerful than a
cognitive idea. Thus[, we re-discover ancient, archetypal Indigenous
thought patterns. It requires creative disobedience to and strategic
noncooperation with the prevailing political economy, while
re-constructing locally reliant communities patterned on instructive
models of historic Indigenous and Neolithic villages.]{.underline}

#### Voluntary agreements solve [all]{.underline} relevant concerns 

**Springer, 17**---University of Victoria (Simon, "The limits to Marx:
David Harvey and the condition of postfraternity," Dialogues in Human
Geography 2017, Vol. 7(3) 280--294, dml)

Stretching the horizontal vision: Federation beyond hierarchy and
authority Life already shows in which direction the change will be made.
Not in increasing the powers of the State, but in resorting to free
organization and free federation in all those branches which are now
considered as attributes of the State. ---Peter Kropotkin (2002
\[1887\]: 68--69) [The second major claim]{.underline} that Harvey draws
from Barcelona [is that anarchism **lacks the ability** 'to **stretch
the vision** of political activism from **local** to **far
broader**]{.underline} geographical [**scales**']{.underline} (2017:
242). [Harvey means to warn us of what]{.underline} he elsewhere refers
to as the 'fetishism of organizational preference' (2012a: 7), which [he
assumes to be a mistaken prioritization of the method of organizing over
its desired outcome. To Harvey, such a prefigurative
politics]{.underline}, which is the here and now of anarchism (Ince,
2012; Springer, 2012), [**supposedly prevents anarchists** from being
able to **plan major infrastructures**, **manage environmental
concerns**, or **service transport** and **communication
networks**]{.underline}. Of course, I already provide a partial answer
to this in my original essay (Springer, 2014d), where [I point
to]{.underline} Colin [Ward's]{.underline} (2004) [example of **postal
services** functioning **not through a central world authority**, but
via **voluntary agreements**]{.underline}. [Kropotkin]{.underline} (2002
\[1887\]) [makes the same point with respect to the **independent
federation of European railways**]{.underline} in his time. Harvey
attempts to preempt being called out on the inaccuracy of his claim by
stating that 'anarchist town planners (including Bookchin) understood
this problem but their work is largely ignored within the anarchist
movement' (2017: 242--3). To say this work is overlooked only reveals
Harvey's limited knowledge of the literature and the scant attention he
pays to anarchist writings, and particularly to anarchosyndicalism,
anarchism's oldest answer to industrial relations wherein worker-managed
production systems are networked into a stateless socialist society
(Rocker, 2004 \[1938\]; Solidarity Federation, 2012). Harvey knows of
Bookchin's libertarian municipalism, but he doesn't take it seriously.
Demonstrating the depths of his state-centric imagination, he lampoons
it by saying 'if it looks like a state, and feels like a state, and
quacks like a state, then it's a state' (Harvey, 2012c: n.p.).
Elsewhere, he suggests Bookchin's idea about assemblies is 'well worth
elaborating as part of a radical anti-capitalist agenda' (Harvey, 2012a:
85), yet instead of actually doing so, Harvey falls back on a
centralization argument, where the state takes center stage. Perhaps the
most confounding statement in Harvey's entire essay is that the
dialectic between decentralization and centralization is one of the most
important contradictions within capital \... and I wish all those, like
Springer, who advocate decentralization as if it is an unalloyed good
would look more closely at its consequences and contradictions. Given
that I dedicate an entire essay to this exact question (Springer,
2014b), it's unfortunate that Harvey asks me to listen when he clearly
doesn't do so himself. Far from treating decentralization as a pure
virtue, I attempt to work through what a progressive, anarchist view of
decentralized horizontalism actually means. In the process, I identify
[the]{.underline} contradictions that lurk within Harvey's
**[hierarchical political outlook]{.underline}**, arguing that he
['**poisons the well of decentralization** by **pre-emptively refusing
its possibilities** and positioning **every movement** towards a **more
autonomous political arrangement** as a device that **somehow
necessarily greases the rails for a neoliberal future**']{.underline}
(Springer, 2014b: 403). [Harvey dismisses]{.underline} anarchism's
coupling of decentralization with anti-capitalism precisely because
Marxism cannot accommodate [prefigurative politics, treating
horizontality as a charming, but ultimately limited if not futile,
distraction from realizing the bigger revolutionary
picture]{.underline}. Horizontalism is consequently positioned as
something that might happen after the promised great withering of the
state, and so we can see plainly that the 'stages of history' is not a
caricature, but an unacknowledged specter that continues to haunt the
Marxist project. Failing to understand this particular limit to Marxism,
[Harvey invokes the idea that 'it is difficult if not impossible \... to
take consensual horizontality to much larger scales' and that it is
impossible to proceed without setting up]{.underline} 'confederal' or
'nested' (which means inevitably [hierarchical]{.underline} in my view
but then this too may just be semantics) [structures of decision-making
that entail\[s\] serious adjustments in organized thinking as well as
forms of institutionalized governance]{.underline}. (2017: 248) I've
already offered a lengthy response, where I make clear that the
relationship between scale and hierarchy is not mere semantics
(Springer, 2014b), yet Harvey is content to ignore the whole critique of
the scalar imagination and the emancipatory politics that flow from a
flat ontology (Marston et al., 2005; Woodward et al., 2012). To Harvey
it would seem that a caricature of authority is a better reply than
thinking through how a rhizomic politics can indeed 'stretch the vision
of political activism' (2017: 242), and how it does so without resorting
to the hierarchical politics that are necessarily implied by scalar
thinking. Federalism is, of course, the long-standing anarchist answer
to hierarchy (Proudhon, 1980 \[1863\]; Ward, 2011), yet Harvey
apparently can't be bothered to work through their differences. [Instead
of a **serious discussion of authority**, we get nuggets like I
certainly would not welcome a pilot]{.underline} landing at JFK
[proclaiming that as a good anarchist she does not accept the legitimacy
of]{.underline} the air traffic controllers' authority and that she
proposes to disregard all [aviation rules]{.underline} in the landing
process. (Harvey, 2017: 239) While Harvey assumes he has stumbled upon
[the]{.underline} ultimate [trump card]{.underline}, he [simply
**confuses specialist knowledge with authority**]{.underline}. This is a
question that Bakunin (2010 \[1882\]: 24) answered long ago when he
wrote: In the matter of boots, I refer to the authority of the
bootmaker; concerning houses, canals, or railroads, I consult that of
the architect or the engineer. For such or such special knowledge I
apply to such or such a savant. But [I allow neither the **bootmaker**
nor the **architect** nor **savant** to **impose**]{.underline} his
[**authority** upon me. I **listen to them freely** and **with all the
respect merited** by their **intelligence**, their **character**, their
**knowledge**, **reserving always** my **incontestable right of
criticism** and **censure**]{.underline}. [This isn't good enough for
Harvey]{.underline} though, [and he routinely ridicules horizontal
organization, using **extreme examples** like **nuclear power plants**
and **air traffic control**]{.underline} to make his case. For example,
in a lecture delivered at London School of Economics (LSE), [he argued
that horizontalism is impractical because]{.underline} there are many
aspects of contemporary life that are now organized in what you might
call 'tightly-coupled systems' where you need command and control
structures. [I wouldn't want my anarchist friends to be in charge of a
nuclear power station]{.underline}. (Harvey, 2012b: n.p.) Yet since
horizontal organizational tactics in anarchism are usually part of a
broader class struggle (Solidarity Federation, 2012), [it is **absurd to
suggest** that there would **ever be a time** where anarchists would
enter into assembly]{.underline}---federated or otherwise---[**during a
nuclear meltdown** or the **complex operation of landing an
airplane**]{.underline}. Indeed, [without a discernable hierarchy to
oppose, '**in what possible circumstance would collective struggle be
necessary** during such risky periods?']{.underline} (fkshultze, 2013).
[Nonetheless, **mutual aid** in times of disaster---both natural and
manufactured---is a **recurrent human theme**, where people **regularly
come together** and **organize themselves effectively** around an
ensuing crisis in the **complete absence of a centralized authority**.
We saw this with **spectacular effect** in the wake of **Hurricane
Katrina**]{.underline}, where the state was more concerned with
restoring 'law and order' and criminalizing desperate people than it was
with relief and rescue efforts. [In response to the state's failure,
people **instead helped themselves** and **each other**, particularly
through the formation of the **Common Ground Collective**]{.underline}.
For Kropotkin (2008 \[1902\]: 137), the tendency for mutual aid 'has so
remote an origin, and is so deeply interwoven with all the past
evolution of the human race, that it has been maintained \...
notwithstanding all vicissitudes of history'.

### Security K -- FW

#### "Fair rules" are a [bureaucratic utopia]{.underline} that [reinforces]{.underline} state surveillance and [stifles creativity]{.underline}. 

David **Graeber 15**, arguably the most important anthropologist of the
21st century, American-born, London-based anthropologist and anarchist
activist, leading figure in Occupy Wall Street credited with coining the
phrase "We are the 99 Percent," assistant professor and associate
professor of anthropology at Yale from 1998--2007, "The Utopia of Rules,
or Why We Really Love Bureaucracy After All," Ch. 3 of The Utopia of
Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy, p.
201--205,

[Over the **last thirty or forty years**, anti-authoritarians **around
the world** have been working on creating **new, and more effective,
modes of direct democracy**---ones that might operate without
**any**]{.underline} need for a **[bureaucracy of
violence]{.underline}** to enforce them. I've written about these
efforts extensively elsewhere. A lot of progress has been made. But
those working on such projects often find themselves having to deal with
exactly this sort of horror of "arbitrary" power. [Part of
the]{.underline} work of developing new forms of consensus
[process]{.underline}, for example, [is to create **institutional
forms** that **encourage**]{.underline}, rather than inhibit,
**[improvisation and creativity]{.underline}**. As activists sometimes
put it: in most circumstances, if you bring together a crowd of people,
that crowd will, as a group, behave less intelligently, and less
creatively, than any single member of the crowd is likely to do if on
their own. [Activist decision-making process is]{.underline}, instead,
[designed to make that crowd **smarter** and **more imaginative** than
any **individual participant**]{.underline}.

It is indeed possible to do this, but it takes a lot of work. And the
larger the group, the more formal mechanisms have to be put in place.
The single most important essay in this whole activist tradition is
called "The Tyranny of Structurelessness,"170 written in the 1970s by Jo
Freeman, about organizational crises that occurred in early feminist
consciousness-raising circles when those groups began to attain a
certain size. Freeman observed that such groups always started out with
a kind of rough-and-ready anarchism, an assumption that there was no
need for any formal, parliamentary rules-of-order type mechanisms at
all. People would just sit down in a sisterly manner and work things
out. And this was, indeed, what happened at first. However, as soon as
the groups grew to over, say, twenty people, informal cliques invariably
began to emerge, and small groups of friends or allies began controlling
information, setting agendas, and wielding power in all sorts of subtle
ways. Freeman proposed a number of different formal mechanisms that
might be employed to counteract this effect, but for present purposes,
the specifics don't really matter. Suffice it to say that what is now
referred to as "formal consensus process" largely emerges from the
crisis Freeman described, and the debate her intervention set off.

What I do want to bring attention to is that almost everyone who is not
emerging from an explicitly anti-authoritarian position---and no
insignificant number even of those who are---completely misread
Freeman's essay, and interpret it not as a plea for formal mechanisms to
ensure equality, but as a plea for more transparent hierarchy. Leninists
are notorious for this sort of thing, but Liberals are just as bad. I
can't tell you how many arguments I've had about this. They always go
exactly the same way. First, Freeman's argument about the formation of
cliques and invisible power structures is taken as an argument that any
group of over twenty people will always have to have cliques, power
structures, and people in authority. The next step is to insist that if
you want to minimize the power of such cliques, or any deleterious
effects those power structures might have, the only way to do so is to
institutionalize them: to take the de facto cabal and turn them into a
central committee (or, since that term now has a bad history, usually
they say a coordinating committee, or a steering committee, or something
of that sort.) One needs to get power out of the shadows---to formalize
the process, make up rules, hold elections, specify exactly what the
cabal is allowed to do and what it's not. In this way, at least, power
will be made transparent and "accountable." (Notice that word again. It
comes from accountancy procedures.) It won't in any sense be arbitrary.

From a practical, activist perspective, this prescription is obviously
ridiculous. It is far easier to limit the degree to which informal
cliques can wield effective power by granting them no formal status at
all, and therefore no legitimacy; whatever "formal accountability
structures" it is imagined will contain the
cliques-now-turned-committees can only be far less effective in this
regard, not least because they end up legitimating and hence massively
increasing the differential access to information which allows some in
otherwise egalitarian groups to have greater power to begin with. As I
pointed out in the first essay, structures of transparency inevitably,
as I've described, begin to become structures of stupidity as soon as
that takes place.

So say one argues this point, and the critic concedes it (which usually
they have to because it's pretty much common sense). If so, the next
line of defense is generally aesthetic: the critic will insist it's
simply distasteful to have structures of real power that are not
recognized and that can, even if they entirely lack any degree of
violent enforcement, be considered arbitrary. Usually, one's
interlocutor won't go so far as actually admitting their objections are
aesthetic. Usually they will frame their arguments in moral terms. But
occasionally, you will find some honest enough to admit that's what's
going on. I well remember having an Occupy Wall Street-sponsored debate
in Central Park (I'm sure it's recorded somewhere) with Norman
Finkelstein---a brilliant and altogether admirable activist, who had
come of age with the Civil Rights Movement and still saw groups like the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference as his inspiration. At this
debate, Finkelstein stated the matter outright. Maybe it's true, he
admitted, that the best way to keep such cliques from attaining too much
power is to maintain a principle that they should not exist. But as long
as such cliques are allowed to exist without being formally acknowledged
and regulated, you're maintaining a system that says it's okay to be
governed, even a tiny bit, from the shadows. It might not be that much
of a practical problem. You might well be right that formally
recognizing their existence might actually end up creating less overall
freedom than leaving well enough alone. But in the final analysis, I
just find the idea of being governed from the shadows, in any sense,
distasteful.

In such arguments, [we are witnessing a **direct clash** between two
different forms of materialized utopianism:]{.underline} on the one
hand, [an anti-authoritarianism that, in its emphasis on **creative
synthesis and improvisation**, sees freedom]{.underline} basically **[in
terms of play]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} on the other, [**a tacit
republicanism** that sees freedom]{.underline} ultimately [as the
ability to reduce **all forms of power** to a set of **clear and
transparent rules**]{.underline}.

[For the last two hundred years]{.underline}, in Europe and North
America---and increasingly, elsewhere---that latter, [**bureaucratized
notion of freedom** has tended to hold sway. **New institutional
arrangements** that operate by rules **so strict and
predictable**]{.underline} [they essentially disappear]{.underline}, so
that one doesn't even know what they are (such as the physical or
electronic post offices with which I began) tend to be put forward as
platforms for human freedom that emerge from the very technical
contingencies of running efficient structures of power. These
arrangements seem to preserve the positive elements of play while
somehow circumventing its more disturbing potentials.

But time and again, [we have seen **the same results**]{.underline}.
Whether motivated by a faith in "rationality" or a fear of arbitrary
power, [the **end result** of this **bureaucratized notion of freedom**
is to move toward the **dream of a world** where play has been **limited
entirely**]{.underline}---or, at best, boxed away in some remote
location far from any serious, consequential human endeavor---[while
**every aspect of life** is reduced to **some kind of elaborate,
rule-bound game**]{.underline}. It's not that such a vision lacks
appeal. [Who **hasn't** dreamed of a world where everyone **knows the
rules**, everyone **plays by the rules**, and]{.underline}---even
more---[where people who play by the rules **can actually still win**?
The problem is that this is **just as much a utopian fantasy** as a
world of **absolute free play** would be]{.underline}. It will always
remain [a **glimmering illusion** that **dissolves away** as soon as we
touch it]{.underline}.

Such illusions are not always bad things. One could make a case that
most of the greatest human accomplishments were the result of such
quixotic pursuits. But in this particular case, and in this larger
political-economic context, [where bureaucracy has been the **primary
means** by which a **tiny percentage** of the population extracts wealth
from the rest of us, they have created a situation where the **pursuit
of freedom** from **arbitrary power** simply ends up producing **more
arbitrary power**]{.underline}, and as a result, [regulations **choke
existence**, **armed guards** and **surveillance cameras** appear
everywhere, science and creativity are **smothered**]{.underline}, and
all of us end up finding increasing percentages of our day taken up in
the filling out of forms.

Victoria, "Anarchism! Or What Geography Ought To Be," Antipode Vol.
44(5) pg. 1613

That [radical geography **retains a decidedly statist focus** perhaps
also betrays the **colonial origins** of the discipline itself and a
**hesitation** in **breaking** from **old disciplining
habits**]{.underline}. Yet [the contemporary nation-state]{.underline},
following Anderson (1991) and Billig (1995), [must be understood as a
**smaller-scale replica of the colonial state**]{.underline}. Although
differing in their diffusion and distribution across space, [both
national and colonial state power express **the same violent
principles** of a privileged few wielding influence over others, and
**imposing a singular identity** upon antecedent ways of imagining
belonging]{.underline}. Marx was not oblivious to this critique, yet
here again he advanced a utilitarian ideal. As capitalism spread around
the globe, it gave rise to powerful resistance movements by oppressed
workers and peasants---led by vanguards---which Marx believed would
eventually engender the transcendence of capitalism. In particular
instances Marx supported nationalist struggles, viewing nationalism as
another "stage in development" towards a future workers'
internationalism (Lewis 2000). Yet [from an anarchist perspective it is
**hard to see the emancipatory end** when the means are **shot through
with violence**]{.underline}. [What "national liberation" actually
represents is the **trading of one set of elites** for another, and thus
one form of colonialism for another. While the territorial expression
has been scaled down, **the underlying logic remains
unchanged**]{.underline}. Just as the colonial state sought and was
frequently able to impose a monopoly on violence, the struggle to create
the nation-state is likewise a struggle for the monopoly of violence
(Harris 2004). [What is created in both instances---a colonial or
national state--- **is itself a means of violence**]{.underline}. In
recognizing this congruency---notwithstanding Hart's (2008:680)
so-called "properly post-colonial frame of understanding" that continues
to privilege the state---[to be **"post-colonial"** in **any meaningful
sense** is to also be **"post-statist" or anarchic**, wherein the
hierarchies, order, authority, and violence upon which these parallel
state projects have been built **are rejected outright**]{.underline}.
Moreover, [internationalism by definition **can never actually transcend
the state**; instead it continues to **presuppose and assume
nations**]{.underline}. By calling for trans- geographical co-operation
between nations, Marx's internationalism fails to move beyond the notion
of the nation-state as the foundational unit of belonging. Why then has
contemporary radical geography not developed an "anti-colonial
imagination" that rises to the post-statist challenge that Anderson
(2005) argues such a vision actually demands? Reclus and Kropotkin
demonstrated long ago that [geography lends itself well to emancipatory
ideas, and "it was no accident that two of the major anarchists of the
late Nineteenth Century were also geographers]{.underline}" (Ward
2010:209). [There exists an **extraordinary latent potential** within
**contemporary radical geography** to become **even more radical** in
its critiques, and thus **more liberationist** in its focus by
**embracing an anarchist ethos**]{.underline}. [Anarchism is able to
recognize capitalism, imperialism, colonialism, neoliberalism,
militarism, nationalism, classism, racism, ethnocentrism, Orientalism,
sexism, genderism, ageism, ableism, speciesism, carnism, homophobia,
transphobia, sovereignty and the state as interlocking systems of
domination]{.underline}. [The **mutually reinforcing composition** of
these various dimensions of "archy" consequently means that to
**uncritically exempt** one from interrogation, is to **perpetuate this
omnicidal conglomeration** as a whole]{.underline}. Unlike the
circumscriptions of Marxian geography, [the **promise of anarchist
geographies** rests precisely in their **ability to think integrally**
and **therein refuse to assign priority** to any one of the **multiple
dominating apparatuses**, as **all are irreducible to one
another**]{.underline} (Brown 1996). This means that **[no one struggle
can wait on any other]{.underline}**. [**It's all or nothing**, and the
a priori privilege of the workers, the vanguards, or any other class
over others is to be rejected on the basis of its incipient
hierarchy.]{.underline}

[Social transformation is]{.underline}, of course, [**necessarily a
spatial project**, and **a spatial dimension** to the **effective
critique of existing structures** is an **important element** of
**imagining** and **forging spaces** for new ones]{.underline}.
Accordingly, [we remain **deeply cynical** of those ostensibly
**"radical" views** that **leave the prescriptions** and **authority**
of the state firmly **intact**]{.underline}. [Without **appreciating the
infinite possibilities** that actually exist if we only had the
**collective courage** and **freedom to explore them**, we are left with
an **all too limited vision** of the **geographical horizons** of
**human organization**]{.underline}. We must similarly remain attentive
to the idea that [**adaptations and abuses of state power** are
intrinsic not only to neoliberalism and capitalism more
generally]{.underline} (Peck 2001), **[but also to Marxism in its
traditional sense]{.underline}**. [In the face of **the sheer enormity
of the bloodshed** that came with **communist projects** in the **former
Soviet Union**, **Maoist China**, and **Pol Pot's Cambodia**, and the
**conflict**, **othering**, and **violence** that is facilitated by a
**Westphalian system of sovereign rule**, we long for and are **actively
committed** to procuring **alternative socio-spatial arrangements**
wherein people are **liberated** from **all forms of domination** and
are **free to collectively make of themselves** **what they
will**]{.underline}. While [we are **keen to critique Marxist-Leninism**
in all its various guises, we acknowledge that there are **heterodox
Marxists** working with **more autonomist** and **libertarian ideas**
that share similar concerns and are **far less antithetical to anarchist
approaches**]{.underline}. At the same time, we recognize that it is
incorrect to suggest--- as post-left anarchists like Fredy Perlman
(1983) have argued---that if we simply choose to act differently then
society will magically transform into a post-capitalist, post-statist
world. [Anarchist thinkers have long interrogated complex matrices of
control and surveillance, highlighting the ways in which the agents of
state and capital converge to produce powerful regimes of containment or
straightforward obliteration of their political opponents]{.underline}
(Graham 2005, 2009; Gue ́rin 2005; Marshall 1992; Woodcock 2004).
Indeed, Daniel Gue ́rin's (2010 \[1936\]) careful tracing of the
synergies between the rise of European fascism in the 1930s and the
organizational and disciplinary logic of the capitalist state can be
read as a powerful warning from history in the current context of
recession, unrest, and the re-emergence of the far right.

Thus, [anarchist approaches to understanding and acting in society
operate in a **tension between** an **assertion of peoples' agency** to
**collectively self-manage their affairs** on the one hand, and **the
everyday matrices of power** that constrain **autonomy**, **solidarity**
and **equality** on the other]{.underline}. However, [anarchism is also
a philosophy that is **healthily sceptical** of analysis for its own
sake, and combines its **powerful critique of capital** and authority
with a **creative and decentralized mode of praxis**]{.underline}. So
[while we recognize the importance of **utopian thought**, we are **not
content to dwell exclusively** in the realm of ideas, and advocate for
the **importance of direct action** in changing for the better the
**material conditions** of our own lives as well as the lives of
others]{.underline} (Graeber 2009). Notwithstanding the now-cliche ́d
refrain that [anarchists were at the creative centre of the movements
against neoliberal globalisation around the turn of the twenty-first
century, anarchist thought and action has **profoundly influenced**
contemporary society in a **much more long-term and subcutaneous
sense**]{.underline}. [The proliferation of **wikis**, **peer-to-peer
file-sharing** and **open-source software**; the **continued
popularity** of the **co-operative movement**, **tenants' associations**
and **trade** and **credit unions**; and a host of **small- scale mutual
aid groups**, **networks** and **initiatives**---these have, all to
varying extents, been **pioneered**, **inspired or run by
anarchists**]{.underline}. [Our perception of anarchism's role in the
world is]{.underline}, however, [**in direct proportion** to our
understanding of **what anarchism is** and **where (or how) it takes
place**]{.underline}. [Although at times it may appear that anarchism is
chiefly (or solely) manifested in occasional spectacular riots on the
streets of Athens, Prague, London and Seattle, papers in this special
issue indicate that anarchism is a **philosophy of everyday life**,
ingrained in its **practitioners as a tool for survival**, **wellbeing**
and **social change**]{.underline}. It is worth noting that, perhaps
precisely due to the legacy of Reclus and Kropotkin, [anarchist
geographers have tended to shy away from engaging with the more
insurrectionary approaches to anarchism, where instead anarchism has
been understood as a **living breathing process** that is **acutely
implicated in our shared histories**, our **present circumstances**, and
**our collective futures**]{.underline}. In this special issue, [a broad
understanding of anarchism is deployed to demonstrate how it---much like
other political philosophies---is a multi-vocal and developing terrain,
contested both from within and without]{.underline}.

[What is happening to national politics]{.underline}? Every day [in the
**US**]{.underline}, [events further exceed the imaginations of
absurdist novelists and comedians]{.underline}; [politics in the
**UK**]{.underline} [still shows **few signs of recovery**]{.underline}
[after]{.underline} the "national nervous breakdown" of
[Brexit]{.underline}. **[France]{.underline}** "[narrowly escaped a
heart attack" in last year's elections]{.underline}, but [the country's
leading daily feels this has done little to alter the "**accelerated
decomposition**" of the **political system**]{.underline}.
[In]{.underline} neighbouring **[Spain]{.underline}**, El País goes so
far as to say that "the [rule of law]{.underline}, the [democratic
system and]{.underline} even the [market economy are in
doubt]{.underline}"; [in **Italy**]{.underline}, "[the collapse of the
establishment]{.underline}" [in the March elections has]{.underline}
even [brought talk of a "barbarian arrival]{.underline}", as if Rome
were falling once again. [In **Germany**]{.underline}, meanwhile,
[neo-fascists are preparing to take up their role as official
opposition]{.underline}, introducing anxious volatility into the bastion
of European stability.

But the [convulsions in national politics are **not confined** to the
**west**]{.underline}. [**Exhaustion**, hopelessness, the dwindling
effectiveness of old ways]{.underline}: these [are the themes of
politics all **across the world**]{.underline}. [This is why energetic
authoritarian "solutions" are currently so popular]{.underline}:
[distraction by **war**]{.underline} (**[Russia]{.underline}**,
**[Turkey]{.underline}**); [ethno-religious "purification]{.underline}"
([India]{.underline}, [Hungary]{.underline}, [Myanmar]{.underline}); the
[magnification of presidential powers and the corresponding abandonment
of civil rights]{.underline} and the rule of law ([China]{.underline},
[Rwanda]{.underline}, [Venezuela]{.underline}, [Thailand]{.underline},
the [Philippines]{.underline} [and many more]{.underline}).

What is the relationship between these various upheavals? [We tend to
regard them as **entirely separate**]{.underline} -- for, in political
life, national solipsism is the rule. [In each country, the tendency is
to blame "our" history, "our" populists, "our" media, "our"
institutions, "our" lousy politicians]{.underline}. And this is
understandable, since the organs of modern political consciousness --
public education and mass media -- emerged in the 19th century from a
globe-conquering ideology of unique national destinies. When we discuss
"politics", we refer to what goes on inside sovereign states; everything
else is "foreign affairs" or "international relations" -- even in this
era of global financial and technological integration. We may buy the
same products in every country of the world, we may all use Google and
Facebook, but political life, curiously, is made of separate stuff and
keeps the antique faith of borders.

Yes, there is awareness that similar varieties of populism are erupting
in many countries. Several have noted the parallels in style and
substance between leaders such as Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Narendra
Modi, Viktor Orbán and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. There is a sense that
something is in the air -- some coincidence of feeling between places.
But this does not get close enough. For there is no coincidence. All
countries are today embedded in the same system, which subjects them all
to the same pressures: and it is these that are squeezing and warping
national political life everywhere. And their effect is quite the
opposite -- despite the desperate flag-waving -- of the oft-remarked
"resurgence of the nation state".

[The **most momentous development** of **our era**]{.underline},
precisely, [is the **waning** of the **nation state**: its **inability
to withstand** countervailing **21st-century forces**, and its
calamitous **loss of influence** over human circumstance]{.underline}.
[National political authority is in decline]{.underline}, and, [since we
do not know any other sort]{.underline}, [it feels like the end of the
world]{.underline}. [This is why a strange brand of **apocalyptic
nationalism** is so widely **in vogue**]{.underline}. But the current
appeal of machismo as political style, the wall-building and xenophobia,
the mythology and race theory, the fantastical promises of national
restoration -- these are not cures, but symptoms of what is slowly
revealing itself to all: **[nation states everywhere]{.underline}** [are
in an advanced state of political and **moral decay**]{.underline} from
which they cannot individually extricate themselves.

Why is this happening? In brief, [20th-century political structures are
drowning in a 21st-century ocean of **deregulated finance**,
**autonomous tech**nology, **religious militancy** and **great-power
rivalry**]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the suppressed consequences of
20th-century recklessness in the once-colonised world are erupting,
cracking nations into fragments and forcing populations into
post-national solidarities: roving tribal militias, ethnic and religious
sub-states and super-states. Finally, the old superpowers' demolition of
old ideas of international society -- ideas of the "society of nations"
that were essential to the way the new world order was envisioned after
1918 -- has turned the nation-state system into a lawless gangland; and
this is now producing a nihilistic backlash from the ones who have been
most terrorised and despoiled.

[The]{.underline} result? [For increasing numbers of
people]{.underline}, [our **nation**s and the **system** of which they
are a part now appear **unable** to offer a plausible, **viable
future**]{.underline}. This is particularly the case as [they watch
financial elites]{.underline} -- and their wealth -- [increasingly
**escaping national allegiances** altogether]{.underline}. Today's
failure of national political authority, after all, derives in large
part from the loss of control over money flows. At the most obvious
level, money is being transferred out of national space altogether, into
a booming "offshore" zone. These fleeing trillions undermine national
communities in real and symbolic ways. They are a cause of national
decay, but they are also a result: for [nation states have **lost**
their **moral aura**]{.underline}, which is [one of the reasons **tax
evasion** has become an accepted fundament of 21st-century
commerce]{.underline}.

More dramatically, great numbers of people are losing all semblance of a
national home, and finding themselves pitched into a particular kind of
contemporary hell. Seven years after the fall of Gaddafi's dictatorship,
Libya is controlled by two rival governments, each with its own
parliament, and by several militia groups fighting to control oil
wealth. But Libya is only one of many countries that appear whole only
on maps. Since 1989, barely 5% of the world's wars have taken place
between states: national breakdown, not foreign invasion, has caused the
vast majority of the 9 million war deaths in that time. And, as we know
from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Syria, the ensuing vacuum
can suck in firepower from all over the world, destroying conditions for
life and spewing shell-shocked refugees in every direction. Nothing
advertises the crisis of our nation-state system so well, in fact, as
its 65 million refugees -- a "new normal" far greater than the "old
emergency" (in 1945) of 40 million. The unwillingness even to
acknowledge this crisis, meanwhile, is appropriately captured by the
contempt for refugees that now drives so much of politics in the rich
world.

The crisis was not wholly inevitable. Since 1945, we have actively
reduced our world political system to a dangerous mockery of what was
designed by US president Woodrow Wilson and many others after the
cataclysm of the first world war, and now we are facing the
consequences. But we should not leap too quickly into renovation. This
system has done far less to deliver human security and dignity than we
imagine -- in some ways, it has been a colossal failure -- and there are
good reasons why it is ageing so much more quickly than the empires it
replaced.

**[Even if we wanted]{.underline}** [to **restore** what we once had,
**that moment is gone**]{.underline}. The reason the nation state was
able to deliver what achievements it did -- and in some places they were
spectacular -- was that there was, for much of the 20th century, an
authentic "fit" between politics, economy and information, all of which
were organised at a national scale. National governments possessed
actual powers to manage modern economic and ideological energies, and to
turn them towards human -- sometimes almost utopian -- ends. But that
era is over. [After]{.underline} so many decades of
[globalisation]{.underline}, **[economics and information]{.underline}**
[have successfully **grown beyond** the **authority** of **national
governments**]{.underline}. Today, [the **distribution** of **planetary
wealth** and resources is largely **uncontested** by **any political
mechanism**]{.underline}.

But to acknowledge this is to acknowledge the end of politics itself.
And if we continue to think the administrative system we inherited from
our ancestors allows for no innovation, we condemn ourselves to a long
period of dwindling political and moral hope. Half a century has been
spent building the global system on which we all now depend, and it is
here to stay. Without political innovation, global capital and
technology will rule us without any kind of democratic consultation, as
naturally and indubitably as the rising oceans.

If we wish to rediscover a sense of political purpose in our era of
global finance, big data, mass migration and ecological upheaval, we
have to imagine political forms capable of operating at that same scale.
The current political system must be supplemented with global financial
regulations, certainly, and probably transnational political mechanisms,
too. That is how we will complete this globalisation of ours, which
today stands dangerously unfinished. Its economic and technological
systems are dazzling indeed, but in order for it to serve the human
community, it must be subordinated to an equally spectacular political
infrastructure, which we have not even begun to conceive.

[It will be objected]{.underline}, inevitably, [that **any alternative**
to the **nation-state system** is a **utopian
impossibility**]{.underline}. But [even the **tech**nological
accomplishments of the last few decades **seemed implausible** before
they arrived]{.underline}, and [there are **good reasons** to be
**suspicious** of those **incumbent authorities** who **tell us** that
**human beings** are **incapable** of **similar grandeur** in the
political realm]{.underline}. In fact, [there have been **many moments**
in **history** when **politics** was **suddenly expanded** to a
new]{.underline}, previously [inconceivable scale]{.underline} --
[**including** the **creation of the nation state** itself]{.underline}.
And -- as is becoming clearer every day -- [the **real
delusion**]{.underline} [is the **belief** that **things can carry on as
they are**]{.underline}.

[The **first step** will be **ceasing to pretend** that **there is no
alternative**]{.underline}. So let us begin by considering the scale of
the current crisis.

Let us start with the west. Europe, of course, invented the nation
state: the principle of territorial sovereignty was agreed at the Treaty
of Westphalia in 1648. The treaty made large-scale conquest difficult
within the continent; instead, European nations expanded into the rest
of the world. The dividends of colonial plunder were converted, back
home, into strong states with powerful bureaucracies and democratic
polities -- the template for modern European life.

By the end of 19th century, European nations had acquired uniform
attributes still familiar today -- in particular, a set of fiercely
enforced state monopolies (defence, taxation and law, among others),
which gave governments substantial mastery of the national destiny. In
return, a moral promise was made to all: the development, spiritual and
material, of citizen and nation alike. Spectacular state-run projects in
the fields of education, healthcare, welfare and culture arose to
substantiate this promise.

The withdrawal of this moral promise over the past four decades has been
a shattering metaphysical event in the west, and one that has left
populations rummaging around for new things to believe in. For the
promise was a major event in the evolution of the western psyche. It was
part of a profound theological reorganisation: the French Revolution
dethroned not only the monarch, but also God, whose superlative
attributes -- omniscience and omnipotence -- were now absorbed into the
institutions of the state itself. The state's power to develop, liberate
and redeem mankind became the foundational secular faith.

During the period of decolonisation that followed the second world war,
the European nation-state structure was exported everywhere. But
westerners still felt its moral promise with an intensity peculiar to
themselves -- more so than ever, in fact, after the creation of the
welfare state and decades of unprecedented postwar growth. Nostalgia for
that golden age of the nation state continues to distort western
political debate to this day, but it was built on an improbable
coincidence of conditions that will never recur. Very significant was
the structure of the postwar state itself, which possessed a
historically unique level of control over the domestic economy. Capital
could not flow unchecked across borders and foreign currency speculation
was negligible compared to today. Governments, in other words, had
substantial control over money flows, and if they spoke of changing
things, it was because they actually could. The fact that capital was
captive meant they Governments could impose historic rates of taxation,
which, in an era of record economic growth, allowed them to channel
unprecedented energies into national development. For a few decades,
state power was monumental -- almost divine, indeed -- and it created
the most secure and equal capitalist societies ever known.

The destruction of state authority over capital has of course been the
explicit objective of the financial revolution that defines our present
era. As a result, states have been forced to shed social commitments in
order to reinvent themselves as custodians of the market. This has
drastically diminished national political authority in both real and
symbolic ways. Barack Obama in 2013 called inequality "the defining
challenge of our time", but US inequality has risen continually since
1980, without regard for his qualms or those of any other president.

The picture is the same all over the west: the wealth of the richest
continues to skyrocket, while post-crisis austerity cripples the
social-democratic welfare state. We can all see the growing fury at
governments that refuse to fulfil their old moral promise -- but it is
most probable that they no longer can. Western governments possess
nothing like their previous command over national economic life, and if
they continue to promise fundamental change, it is now at the level of
PR and wish fulfilment.

There is every reason to believe that the next stage of the
techno-financial revolution will be even more disastrous for national
political authority. This will arise as the natural continuation of
existing technological processes, which promise new, algorithmic kinds
of governance to further undermine the political variety. Big data
companies (Google, Facebook etc) have already assumed many functions
previously associated with the state, from cartography to surveillance.
Now they are the primary gatekeepers of social reality: membership of
these systems is a new, corporate, de-territorialised form of
citizenship, antagonistic at every level to the national kind. And, as
the growth of digital currencies shows, new technologies will emerge to
replace the other fundamental functions of the nation state. The
libertarian dream -- whereby antique bureaucracies succumb to pristine
hi-tech corporate systems, which then take over the management of all
life and resources -- is a more likely vision for the future than any
fantasy of a return to social democracy.

Governments controlled by outside forces and possessing only partial
influence over national affairs: this has always been so in the world's
poorest countries. But in the west, it feels like a terrifying return to
primitive vulnerability. The assault on political authority is not a
merely "economic" or "technological" event. It is an epochal upheaval,
which leaves western populations shattered and bereft. There are
outbreaks of irrational rage, especially against immigrants, the
appointed scapegoats for much deeper forms of national contamination.
The idea of the western nation as a universal home collapses, and
transnational tribal identities grow up as a refuge: white supremacists
and radical Islamists alike take up arms against contamination and
corruption.

The stakes could not be higher. So it is easy to see why [**western
governments** are]{.underline} so [**desperate to prove** what everyone
doubts]{.underline}: [that they are **still in control**]{.underline}.
[It is not merely]{.underline} Donald [Trump's personality that causes
him to act like a sociopathic CEO]{.underline}. The era of globalisation
has seen consistent attempts by US presidents to enhance the authority
of the executive, but they are never enough. [Trump's office can never
have the level of mastery over American life that Kennedy's
did]{.underline}, so [he is obliged to **fake it**]{.underline}. He
cannot make America great again, but he does have Twitter, through which
he can establish a lone-gun personality cult -- blaming women, leftists
and brown people for the state's impotence. [He cannot heal America's
social divisions]{.underline}, [but he still controls the security
apparatus, which can be deployed to help him **look
"tough"**]{.underline} -- [declaring **war on crime**]{.underline},
**[deporting foreigners]{.underline}**, **[hardening
borders]{.underline}**. He cannot put more money into the hands of the
poor who voted for him, but [he can hand out]{.underline}
**[mythological currency]{.underline}** instead; even his poorest
voters, after all, possess one significant asset -- US citizenship --
whose value he can "talk up", as he previously talked up casinos and
hotels. [Like **Putin** or **Orbán**]{.underline}, [Trump **imbues
citizenship** with new **martial power**, and makes a **big show** of
**withholding it** from people who want it]{.underline}: [what is
**scarcer**]{.underline}, obviously, [is more precious]{.underline}.
[**Citizens who have nothing** are **persuaded** that **they have a
lot**]{.underline}.

[These **strategies** are ugly]{.underline}, [but they **cannot** simply
**be blamed** on a **few bad actors**]{.underline}. [The predicament is
this]{.underline}: [**political authority** is **running on
empty**]{.underline}, and [**leaders** are **unable to deliver**
meaningful **material change**]{.underline}. [Instead, they must arouse
and deploy **powerful feelings**]{.underline}: **[hatred of
foreigners]{.underline}** [and **internal enemies**]{.underline}, for
instance, [or the euphoria of **meaningless military
exploits**]{.underline} ([Putin's annexation of Crimea]{.underline}
raised the hugely popular prospect of general Tsarist revival).

But let us not imagine that these strategies will quickly break down
under their own deceptions as moderation magically comes back into
fashion. As Putin's Russia has shown, chauvinism is more effective than
we like to believe. Partly because citizens are desperate for the
cover-up to succeed: deep down, they know to be scared of what will
happen if the power of the state is revealed to be a hoax.

In the world's poorest countries, the picture is very different. Almost
all those nations emerged in the 20th century from the Eurasian empires.
It has become de rigueur to despise empires, but they have been the
"normal" mode of governance for much of history. The Ottoman empire,
which lasted from 1300 until 1922, delivered levels of tranquillity and
cultural achievement that seem incredible from the perspective of
today's fractured Middle East. The modern nation of Syria looks unlikely
to last more than a century without breaking apart, and it hardly
provides security or stability for its citizens.

Empires were not democratic, but were built to be inclusive of all those
who came under their rule. It is not the same with nations, which are
founded on the fundamental distinction between who is in and who is out
-- and therefore harbour a tendency toward ethnic purification. This
makes them much more unstable than empires, for that tendency can always
be stoked by nativist demagogues.

Nevertheless, in the previous century it was decided with amazing
alacrity that empires belonged to the past, and the future to nation
states. And yet this revolutionary transformation has done almost
nothing to close the economic gap between the colonised and the
colonising. In the meantime, it has subjected many postcolonial
populations to a bitter cocktail of authoritarianism, ethnic cleansing,
war, corruption and ecological devastation.

If there are so few formerly colonised countries that are now peaceful,
affluent and democratic, it is not, as the west often pretends, because
"bad leaders" somehow ruined otherwise perfectly functional nations. In
the breakneck pace of decolonisation, nations were thrown together in
months; often their alarmed populations fell immediately into violent
conflict to control the new state apparatus, and the power and wealth
that came with it. Many infant states were held together only by
strongmen who entrusted the system to their own tribes or clans,
maintained power by stoking sectarian rivalries and turned ethnic or
religious differences into super-charged axes of political terror.

The list is not a short one. Consider men such as Ne Win (Burma),
Hissène Habré (Chad), Hosni Mubarak (Egypt), Mengistu Haile Mariam
(Ethiopia), Ahmed Sékou Touré (Guinea), Muhammad Suharto (Indonesia),
the Shah of Iran, Saddam Hussein (Iraq), Muammar Gaddafi (Libya), Moussa
Traoré (Mali), General Zia-ul-Haq (Pakistan), Ferdinand Marcos
(Philippines), the Kings of Saudi Arabia, Siaka Stevens (Sierra Leone),
Mohamed Siad Barre (Somalia), Jaafar Nimeiri (Sudan), Hafez al-Assad
(Syria), Idi Amin (Uganda), Mobutu Sese Seko (Zaire) or Robert Mugabe
(Zimbabwe).

Such countries were generally condemned to remain what one influential
commentator has called "quasi-states". Formally equivalent to the older
nations with which they now shared the stage, they were in reality very
different entities, and they could not be expected to deliver comparable
benefits to their citizens.

Those dictators could never have held such incoherent states together
without tremendous reinforcement from outside, which was what sealed the
lid on the pressure cooker. The post-imperial ethos was hospitable to
dictators, of course: with the UN's moral rejection of foreign rule came
a universal imperative to respect national sovereignty, no matter what
horrors went on behind its closed doors. But the cold war vastly
expanded the resources available to brutal regimes for defending
themselves against revolution and secession. The two superpowers funded
the escalation of post-colonial conflicts to stupefying levels of
fatality: at least 15 million died in the proxy wars of that period, in
theatres as dispersed as Afghanistan, Korea, El Salvador, Angola and
Sudan. And what the superpowers wanted out of all this destruction was a
network of firmly installed clients able to defeat all internal rivals.

There was nothing stable about this cold war "stability", but its
devastation was contained within the borders of its proxy states. The
breakup of the superpower system, however, has led to the implosion of
state authority across large groups of economically and politically
impoverished countries -- and the resulting eruptions are not contained
at all. Destroyed political cultures have given rise to startling
"post-national" forces such as Islamic State, which are cutting through
national borders and transmitting chaos, potentially, into every corner
of the world.

Over the past 20 years, the slow, post-cold-war rot in Africa and the
Middle East has been exuberantly exploited by these kinds of forces --
whose position, since there are more countries set to go the way of
Yemen, South Sudan, Syria and Somalia, is flush with opportunity. Their
adherents have lost the enchantment for the old slogans of
nation-building. Their political technology is charismatic religion, and
the future they seek is inspired by the ancient golden empires that
existed before the invention of nations. Militant religious groups in
Africa and the Middle East are less engaged in the old project of
seizing the state apparatus; instead, they cut holes and tunnels in
state authority, and so assemble transnational networks of tax
collection, trade routes and military supply lines.

Such a network currently extends from Mauritania in the west to Yemen in
the east, and from Kenya and Somalia in the south to Algeria and Syria
in the north. This eats away the old political architecture from the
inside, making several nation states (such as Mali and the Central
African Republic) essentially non-functional, which in turn creates
further opportunities for consolidation and expansion. Several ethnic
groups, meanwhile -- such as the Kurds and the Tuareg -- which were left
without a homeland after decolonisation, and stranded as persecuted
minorities ever since, have also exploited the rifts in state authority
to assemble the beginnings of transnational territories. It is in the
world's most dangerous regions that today's new political possibilities
are being imagined.

The west's commitment to nation states has been self-servingly partial.
For many decades, it was content to see large areas of the world suffer
under terrifying parodies of well-established Western states; it cannot
complain that those areas now display little loyalty to the nation-state
idea. Especially since they have also borne the most traumatic
consequences of climate change, a phenomenon for which they were least
responsible and least equipped to withstand. The strategic calculation
of new militant groups in that region is in many ways quite accurate:
the transition from empire to independent nation states has been a
massive and unremitting failure, and, after three generations, there
needs to be a way out.

But there is no possibility that al-Shabaab, the Janjaweed, Seleka, Boko
Haram, Ansar Dine, Isis or al-Qaida will provide that way out. The
situation requires new ideas of political organisation and global
economic redistribution. There is no superpower great enough, any more,
to contain the effects of exploding "quasi-states". Barbed wire and
harder borders will certainly not suffice to keep such human disasters
at bay.

Let us turn to the nature of the nation-state system itself. The
international order as we know it is not so old. The nation state became
the universal template for human political organisation only after the
first world war, when a new principle -- "national self-determination,",
as US President Woodrow Wilson named it -- buried the many other
blueprints under debate. Today, after a century of lugubrious
"international relations", the only aspect of this principle we still
remember is the one most familiar to us: national independence. But
Wilson's original programme, informed by a loose international coalition
including such diverse visionaries as Andrew Carnegie and Leonard Woolf
(husband of Virginia), aimed for something far more ambitious: a
comprehensive intra-state democracy designed to ensure global
cooperation, peace and justice.

How were human beings to live securely in their new nations, after all,
if nations themselves were not subject to any law? The new order of
nations only made sense if these were integrated into a "society of
nations": a formal global society with its own universal institutions,
empowered to police the violence that individual states would not
regulate on their own: the violence they perpetrated themselves, whether
against other states or their own citizens.

The cold war definitively buried this "society", and we have lived ever
since with a drastically degraded version of what was intended. During
that period, both superpowers actively destroyed any constraints on
international action, maintaining a level of international lawlessness
worthy of the "scramble for Africa". Without such constraints, their
disproportionate power produced exactly what one would expect:
gangsterism. The end of the cold war did nothing to change American
behaviour: the US is today dependent on lawlessness in international
society, and on the perpetual warfare-against-the-weak that is its
consequence.

Just as illegitimate government within a nation cannot persist for long
without opposition, [the **illegitimate international order** we have
lived with for so many decades is **quickly exhausting** the **assent**
it once enjoyed]{.underline}. In many areas of the world today, [there
is **no remaining illusion** that this system can offer a viable
future]{.underline}. [All that remains is exit]{.underline}. Some are
staking everything on a western passport, which, since the supreme value
of western life is still enshrined in the system, is the one guarantee
of meaningful constitutional protection. But such passports are
difficult to get.

That leaves the other kind of exit, which is to take up arms against the
state system itself. The appeal of Isis for its converts was its claim
to erase from the Middle East the catastrophe of the post-imperial
century. It will be remembered that the group's most triumphant
publicity was associated with its penetration of the Iraq-Syria border.
This was presented as a victory over the 1916 treaties by which the
British and French divided the Ottoman Empire amongst themselves --
Isis's PR arm issued the Twitter hashtag #SykesPicotOver -- and
inaugurated a century of Mesopotamian bombing. It arose from an entirely
justifiable rejection of a system that obstinately designated -- during
the course of a century and more -- Arabs as "savages" to whom no
dignity or protection would be extended.

The era of national self-determination has turned out to be an era of
international lawlessness, which has crippled the legitimacy of the
nation state system. And, while revolutionary groups attempt to destroy
the system "from below", assertive regional powers are destroying it
"from above" -- by infringing national borders in their own backyards.
[**Russia's escapade** in **Ukraine** demonstrates that there are now
few consequences to neo-imperial bagatelles]{.underline}, [and
**China's** route to **usurping**]{.underline} the 22nd-richest country
in the world -- **[Taiwan]{.underline}** -- [lies open. The true extent
of our **insecurity**]{.underline} [will be revealed as the relative
power of the **US** further **declines**]{.underline}, [and it can **no
longer do anything** to **control the chaos** it helped
create]{.underline}.

### Security K -- AT: Realism

#### Realism makes war [structurally inevitable]{.underline}. Only a fundamental shift in thinking patterns solves.

Andrew **Robinson 10**, political theorist and activist based in the UK,
8/6/10, "In Theory Anarchism, war and the state,"
<https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/anarchism-war-and-the-state/>, Stras

In response to a common misconception, it is not true that anarchists
oppose the state because they are naïve about human nature. Anarchist
views about human nature are widely variant. Objections to the state can
be convincing based on many different views, such as distrusting people
to hold too much power without abusing it. Statists might be said to
have a dual conception of human nature: the good people are trusted with
excessive power so as to disempower the bad people. Statism is thus
associated with hierarchical differentiations of people. Further, the
objection is not simply to states as institutions but to state-like ways
of relating and acting: in some accounts, the state is a social
relation. In anarchist theory, [states are]{.underline} viewed as
expressions of [**hierarchical, oppressive social logics**. They are
forces of **decomposition**]{.underline}, which tend to attack or break
down alternative, horizontal social relations. They are also [based on
'reactive' emotional forces of **suspicion**, **hatred** and
**aggression** which they channel to produce **warlike
relations**]{.underline} among people. [They]{.underline} also [turn on
one another, accumulating **wealth** by **pillaging other states or
societies**]{.underline}. Against such state violence, [anarchist
strategies]{.underline} often [seek to]{.underline} find or [form
**focal-points** for social power which can
**counterbalance**]{.underline} or draw energies away from [state
power]{.underline}. These focal-points necessarily involve living and
[acting in **non-militarist, non-authoritarian ways**]{.underline}.

In Statism and Anarchy, Bakunin portrays [the modern state as
**primarily military**]{.underline}, and [**closely connected** to the
ruling class]{.underline}. As a military force, [the state is
**necessarily aggressive**, competing with **other states for power**.
It produces **moral** and **intellectual decay** through its corrupting
power]{.underline}. The extent of this decay depends on the extent to
which the state's way of thinking filters down through society, a
process which is strongest in the most militaristic states. The
'people', primarily meaning the excluded and powerless, are for Bakunin
a potential counterpoint to the state, and can destroy it in
insurrection.

Kropotkin similarly argues that the state, or 'political principle'
(vertical association or hierarchy), is counterposed to society, or the
'social principle' (horizontal association or affinity). In The State:
Its Historic Role, he argues that [the state is '**synonymous with
war**']{.underline}. The state brings peace, if at all, only as lifeless
dominance in a 'colourless, lifeless whole'. Social networks bring
effervescent life, whereas states bring death through structural
violence and pillage. [Since the state cannot tolerate **other sources
of power**, it wages **constant war**]{.underline} against social
networks as they arise. There is thus a constant zero-sum struggle
between the state as a force of control and impoverishment and social
networks as spaces for freedom and creativity. Local communities have
capabilities for self-defence and/or peacebuilding. Although wars can be
fought outside or against states, they have a different significance,
enlivening people in the defence of liberty rather than disempowering
them through its destruction.

Stirner's argument is rather different. In The Ego and its Own, he
starts from a critique of social roles and categories, termed 'spooks'
in his work, to derive a critique of submission to overarching
categories of all kinds. Stirner is what would today be called an
'anti-essentialist', an opponent of fixed labels and of the privileging
of some aspects of a person over others. States are rejected as bearers
of particular categories which are wrongly accorded a greater status
than other categories. Further, sacrifices for the state are always
matters of the state's self-interest. [By claiming a **monopoly on
violence**, the state pursues **self-interested violence** at the
expense of its subjects]{.underline}.

Tolstoy's Christian Anarcho-Pacifism draws similar distinctions, but
characterises the anti-state pole rather differently. For Tolstoy, the
state's 'law of violence' stands against a 'law of love', with each
expressing a particular emotional climate and set of passions. States
embody 'low passions' such as hatred (often channelled against outsiders
using nationalism), against which love provides a basis for peace and
happiness. Love is expressed in acts such as conscientious objection,
withdrawing the social activity on which state violence is based.

Anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were central in
anti-conscription activism in First World War America and were jailed as
prisoners of conscience. Their anti-militarist critiques placed a strong
emphasis on socialist criticisms of the capitalistic basis of war.
Elites use irrational prejudices to manipulate people into fighting on
their behalf. Rudolf Rocker wrote an influential anarchist critique of
nationalism around the same time, portraying the state as distorting
legitimate particularisms into hateful chauvinisms. Also in this period,
Randolph Bourne popularised the phrase ['war is **the health of the
state**']{.underline}. In an unfinished work titled The State, he argued
that [the state demands '**mystic\[al\] devotion**', which war is **a
means to realise**. In war, **the permanent state machine**]{.underline}
displaces party competition and comes to monopolise public life. Its
main [aim is **not victory**, but the '**spiritual compulsion**' bound
up with the ideal of the state, with the triumph of **a 'herd'
mentality**]{.underline} over creativity and difference. [The outpouring
of **irrational, reactive forces** is managed by **nationalistic
elites** for their own benefit]{.underline}.

With fascism overrunning Europe, the leftist psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich
pioneered a sexual-liberationist critique of militaristic states in his
Mass Psychology of Fascism. Reich views repressive social systems as
enabled by repressive biological and emotional structures through which
people prevent themselves from feeling emotions. Fascism emerges from a
complete identification with state power and the leader, a pattern
derived from identification with the father in patriarchal,
authoritarian families. Such families train people to channel
attachments vertically rather than horizontally. More recently, Klaus
Theweleit used this approach to interpret the masculine violence of
proto-fascist groups as an attempt to seek existential security in
categories of purity and displays of superiority over demonised others.
On a similar line of thought, authors from the Frankfurt School have
argued that industrialised war and genocide throw doubt on the
benevolence of modernity. Adorno links war to the desire to dominate
nature. Fromm argues that humanity's survival is put at risk by a
peculiarly human type of malevolent aggression arising from alienation.
Marcuse critiques the discourse of war as a kind of doublespeak, and
interprets modern war as a self-frustrating product of the
frustration-aggression complex. Frustration arising from capitalist life
is channelled and rendered socially functional through military
aggression, but cannot be alleviated by such aggression because human
means of war have been replaced with technological means. War thus tends
towards repetition and escalation.

Walter Benjamin's 'Critique of Violence' distinguishes between three
types of violence or effective action. States are founded in law-making
violence which posits their own command as the law, are maintained by
law-preserving violence which maintains a status-quo through small acts
of enforcement, and can be shattered by law-destroying violence (such as
a general strike). For Benjamin, the state is based on reactive
attachments, here interpreted as power over life for the sake of power,
and is fearful, becoming more authoritarian over time as it becomes
afraid of the emergence of counter-powers. Law-making violence is
instrumental, whereas law-destroying violence is expressive, directing
itself against the capability to use law-making or preserving violence.

The theory of the state as a source of social decomposition by means of
social war is extended by Antonio Negri in his 1970s-era works. Negri
views state violence as a means to preserve capitalist domination as a
kind of irrational social command over labour. [The **new form of the
state**, the '**crisis-state'**, is geared to a **permanent state of
exception** which]{.underline} simultaneously [causes]{.underline} and
wards off extreme risks of destruction such as **[nuclear
war]{.underline}**. It also forms an internal warfare state directed at
forces of life, autonomous social movements, with which it is in an
irreducible antagonism. In this phase, Negri views such movements as
tending to become an armed society counterposed to the state. This view
of radical antagonism fades in Negri's more recent work, but still in
Hardt and Negri's Empire and Multitude, the state is deemed to be waging
an unwinnable, unlimited global war indistinguishable from policing.
Also from an autonomist standpoint, the Midnight Notes Collective have
argued that [**recent wars** are means for preserving **Northern
monopolies** on]{.underline} advanced technologies by playing on risks
of [**weapons proliferation**, or are **resource wars**]{.underline}
focused on the enclosure and exploitation of resources. The idea of the
'state of exception' has been expanded by Giorgio Agamben.

Looking at autonomy more broadly, alternatives to the state also emerge
in studies of stateless indigenous social groups. There is substantial
debate on whether such groups are warlike, with scholars arguing that
certain groups are extremely peaceful or engage only in ritualised forms
of combat. Clastres' theory of indigenous warfare stands out in showing
the difference between indigenous and statist types of war. In his
theory, indigenous war is a way of asserting the difference and autonomy
of each village or band, placing an obstacle in the way of
state-formation by ensuring that power remains diffuse. [Statist
war]{.underline}, in contrast, [causes **ethnocide**]{.underline}, which
is inscribed in the nature of the state as the dissolution of the many
into the one. Autonomous social movements such as La Ruta Pacifica also
offer autonomous responses to war. In this group's discourse, social
weaving is theorised as a way of counterposing energies of hope to those
which sustain the permanent state of war in Colombia. Their activities
focus on morale-boosting, emotional repair, collective mourning and
working through fear. They believe that violence decomposes social
relations, so that power can be exercised by recomposing relations.

### Security K AT: But Nukes!

#### Nukes can be safely dismantled and repurposed.

Benjamin **Plackett 19**, science journalist, 2/8/2019, "The Science of
Dismantling a Nuclear Bomb,"
https://www.insidescience.org/news/science-dismantling-nuclear-bomb

[What do you do with the leftover uranium or plutonium]{.underline}?
[Once the weapon has been taken apart]{.underline}, the process of
dealing with what's left is identical for both the older and the more
sophisticated bombs. "When the great powers decided to reduce their
stockpiles, we were left with fairly substantial quantities of
plutonium," said Rosner. "So, what do you do?" One obvious answer is to
[**repurpose the radioactive material** \--]{.underline} either
plutonium or uranium \-- to [**produce electricity**. To make it
suitable for a power plant, the material needs to be diluted with less
enriched versions]{.underline}. \"There are no power reactors anywhere
in the world that are designed to deal with weapons-grade material,"
said Plant. "You have to down-blend it before you can turn it into
fuel." But that isn't what actually happens to most of the radioactive
material. "It's not always economically viable. It can be cheaper to
enrich new material than it is to downgrade it and repurpose it," said
Rosner. "Shipping plutonium or uranium all over the place from storage
to reactor isn't popular either." "[Mostly it's just stuck in storage
facilities,"]{.underline} said Rosner. Decommissioning the radioactive
waste and keeping it safe is a science in its own right. The extracted
uranium or plutonium will contain different isotopes \-- variants of
themselves that have different atomic masses, which means their
radioactivity decays at different rates. The [highly radioactive
isotopes have **short half-lives**]{.underline}, which means they
[**decay much faster** than the less radioactive ones]{.underline}, and
that creates a lot of heat. "The [material has to be **put in water
pools** f]{.underline}or about half a decade [to cool the
rods]{.underline} while they decay," said Rosner. "[Then you're left
with relatively low-level waste that's less radioactive]{.underline}."

### Security K AT: Global Cooperation

#### No uniqueness\-\--the western led liberal order has completely and utterly failed to facilitate global cooperation over anything

University, "The Rise of the BRICS and American primacy," International
Politics, Vol. 51, p. 137-154

[Skepticism about the BRICS and the momentum assumed by liberal
internationalists has not been scarce]{.underline}.6 Realist scholars
have understandably been critical of the assumptions underlying these
approaches as well as of the foreign policy choices they imply. However,
other [scholars]{.underline} too [have found]{.underline} [increasing
reason for criticism]{.underline}. For example, Barma et al (2013, p.
56) have recently observed that, ['Instead of a gradual trend toward
global problem solving punctuated by isolated failures]{.underline}, [we
have seen]{.underline} over the last several years essentially [the
opposite]{.underline}: [stunningly few]{.underline} [instances of
international cooperation on significant issues']{.underline}. Moreover,
Patrick (2010, p. 44) of the Council on Foreign Relations has cautioned
that, '[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should be under no
illusions about the ease of socializing rising nations.]{.underline}
[Emerging powers may be clamoring for greater global influence, but
they]{.underline} often [oppose the political and economic ground rules
of the inherited Western liberal order]{.underline}, [seek
to]{.underline} [transform existing multilateral arrangements, and shy
away from assuming significant global responsibilities']{.underline}. In
this regard, Laidi has argued that [despite their own heterogeneity, the
BRICS]{.underline} actually [share a common objective in]{.underline}
[opposing Western liberal internationalist narratives]{.underline} that
run counter to traditional state sovereignty. Instead, [they seek to
protect their own prerogatives, independence of action and national
autonomy in an increasingly interdependent world]{.underline} (Laidi,
2012, pp. 614--615).

### Deleuze K -- 1NC Biotech Link

#### Biotechnology is the [next]{.underline} site for control. The human body will be [reduced]{.underline} to [bioinformatics]{.underline}. 

**Faucher, 13** \[Kane X. Faucher is a professor at University of
Western Ontario, January 2013, accessed on 7-24-2022, Springer, \"EX

One area of [applied **informatics**]{.underline} has taken the form of
what has been called [bioinformatics]{.underline}. This burgeoning field
of inquiry involves the [storage and retrieval of **biological** data,
be this identifying unique **genetic** markers in the individual or for
security purposes in retinal **identification**]{.underline}. When it is
employed for the regulation and control of individuals by state or
corporate entities, [the "dark side" of bioinformatics would be an
outgrowth of what Michel Foucault calls "**biopower**,"]{.underline} the
overall [function of which is to subjugate human subjects to
**regulatory control**s.]{.underline} Even beyond human [subjects,
bioinformatics in its connection to **biotechnologies** has been
instrumental in the creation of **new pest-resistant** seeds, such as
are developed by major **biotech**]{.underline} firms like Monsanto,
Syngenta, et al. It is possible, with the assistance of Deleuze and
Guattari's concepts, to develop an alternative[, if not nomadic,
bioinformatics that recognizes what a body can do, and studies its flows
rather than subjects bodies to regulatory **control** relying on
**computational** processes.]{.underline} Although much of
[bioinformatics]{.underline}, as allied with biotechnology and genomics,
[starts with mathematical formulae, algorithms,]{.underline} and
statistics to discover the simple behavioural rules at a cellular [and
genetic level to explain biological processes in biotic systems, a
"nomadized" or "iterantized" bioinformatics would appreciate the flows
and assemblages in biotic systems as being signals of
expression]{.underline}. Would it be useful? The short answer would be
no, but it is a move away from utility that uncovers the intensive
qualities of the biological world[. Deleuze and Guattari are rightly
suspicious of any practice that takes reductionism as its starting
point----be that of an atomic or genetic register----given that it may
smuggle hylomorphism as the pivot around which the understanding of the
world turns.]{.underline} It is here that we grapple with the metonymy
or polysemy of the very word information and how it is applied in
different contexts. In information systems theory, this is indexed on
the product of data processing and the automation of processes in
computing technology. This takes for granted the term of information
being under the sole discretion of the technical aspects of the term
which excludes from view its more philosophical or even mathematical
understanding, although it seems to share more overlap with the latter
with respect to a Shannon-Weaver definition. From the technical
standpoint emerges the engineering approach to managing large systems,
specific communication problems, and "information overload." Again, this
use of information is strictly deployed for the purposes of
understanding and improving the infrastructure of "information" systems
in communication technologies and the Internet. Winnowing information as
a subspecies of computing technologies, researchers in informatics such
as Bo Dahlbohm are quite explicit in defining the boundaries which
betrays a certain technocentric perspective: [To turn computers into
powerful computing machines you need to know numerical methods and
algorithms; to develop information systems you must master business
modelling, systems design, and project organization; personal computing
requires psychological theories of human-computer interaction, skills in
interface design, and how to do usability studies; and to support
networking you must understand human communication and cooperation,
network technology and multimedia production, and the role of
**cyberspace** as a new arena for human enterprise (1996, p. 44) When we
consider the information landscape today as a process of harnessing
**social** power through regimental **ordering** systems that distribute
variety within constraints **via radical customization**, the informatic
trope continues to operate in the digital Umwelt as a means of identity
determination and the **colonization** of digital space]{.underline}.
Moreover, informatics might actually have a considerable impact on
relations between the social and data: First, these [technoscientific
practices and logics form discrete examples where the **relationship**
between the body and language is **reconfigured** as a relationship of
materiality and data/information]{.underline}. Secondly, this
manifestation has been occurring in a socio-cultural site thoroughly
enframed by the technological apparatus of computer and
telecommunications based developments, contributing to the increasingly
intimate conjunction of molecular science research and technological
development that constitutes contemporary technoscience. (Thacker 1998)
[One of the main applications of bioinformatics, beyond the sequencing
of genes and developing techniques for steering genetic production in
harnessing genetic information, would be the direct intervention of
biotechnology on plant life.]{.underline} What began with the discovery
of DNA and the increasing power of technology, blossomed in the 1970s
and boomed in the 1980s toward the manipulation of discrete genetic
sequences for maximizing crop yields that could resist pests. In effect,
the harnessing of genetic information toward these ends is an attempt to
inscribe both the image of the molecular biologist's intentionality and
capital's drive for utility and production at the very site of life
itself. More particularly, the emergence of genetic variations through
modification is an attempt to inscribe or de- and re-territorialize
genetic code along capitalist decoded flows that enable older forms of
capital such as the idea of private property (in the form of
intellectual copyright, or [what we can call the mental **labour** form
of the property flow), and according to relative human scales that
inscribe itself in biological ones]{.underline}. The practice of genetic
modification or biotechnological engineering differs from its older
cousin of selective cross-breeding in that the process for constructing
something new and possibly more durable occurs directly at the level of
code rather than at the level of the completed organisms placed in
relation. At the genetic modification level, the versatility and options
for recombination are much more varied, for it becomes possible to
splice code from an amphibian with that of a tomato----something that
cannot be done at the level of cross-breeding due to the breeding
incompatibility of their respective biological kingdoms. As Mark Hansen
notes (2000), Deleuze and Guattari's take on evolution appears to adopt
more of a neo-[Darwinian approach aligned with their **biophilosophy**,
rejecting in part Bergson's vitalism.]{.underline} And yet, Deleuze and
Guattari seem also to reject Darwin's natural selection, preferring to
raise selection to the level of the abstract machine. In this way, it
would be a hasty mistake to impute to Deleuze and Guattari a kind of
apologia for biotechnologically based genetic modification as the scene
of a more profound selection given the strong relation between
biotechnological engineering and capitalism in the decoding of flows and
the territorialization of life according to the axiomatic of capitalism
itself. We must first distinguish between three ways by which new
organisms are produced: 1. By mutations that are not directly aided by
human intervention, 2. Selective breeding, and, 3. Direct genetic
alteration. Mutations in species can occur partially as a result (or
answer to) an environmental problem, such as the development of the
frog's tongue to catch flies, or the adaptation to changing climates and
interspecies conditions of competition (what can be called
perplication). This may be explained in Deleuzean terms as analogous to
the "natural selection" of singularities that form assemblages from the
ideal line of matter-movement, their temporary assemblage as a
perplication whereby the accidents of contingent reason are what
condition and resolve the problemata. They may also occur on the basis
of more internal and possibly spontaneous arrangements, such as copying
fidelity error from one gene sequence to another. [A more invasive
**procedure** emerged due to scientific advancements linked to the
discovery of DNA: genetic modification.]{.underline} No longer simply a
matter of selective breeding of a single or related species, geneticists
could perform their changes directly to the genetic code itself, thus
making it possible to cross previous boundaries so that, for example,
partial code sequences of a frog's skin could be grafted unto the code
of a tomato's skin. However, it also implicitly endorses fragmentation
of the body, or true organ-ization. [When Deleuze and Guattari speak of
**becoming**-other, or the person **becomingdog**, they are not speaking
literally, but in terms of what assists in articulating the very traits
of the individual in a process of individuation as rooted in a
**nonhylomorphic** understanding of form and content and the double
**articulation** that takes place in terms of **content** and
**expression** as a relative line.]{.underline} However, the connections
that can be drawn between how Deleuze and Guattari [define the rhizome
seem to uncomfortably apply to genetic modification insofar as here we
are presented with radical connectivity between codes, and a crossing
over of signification regimes that in effect designify stable relations
to allow the new to emerge]{.underline}. But that is only surface
resemblance. What we are presented with is the [convergence of
**neoliberal** capital and **cybernetics** inspired control
**mechanisms** making use of the very technical **instruments** designed
for control and modulation frameworks as applied to the **combinatory
potentials** of genetics in the form of biotechnologies]{.underline}.
The distribution of genetic modification activities in large scale
agriculture, or agri-business, are now assigned by those whose actions
control the possibilities that can be harnessed and exploited in the
genetic laboratory. [The plant is thus **deterritorialized** from the
field, the gene from its **sequence**, the farmer from the farming
function as dequalified **labour**. The construction of new patterns in
**genetic** territory are expanded at the macro scale, encompassing now
**corporatized** arable lands for the cultivation of these patterns made
**manifest** in a range of products]{.underline}. Nature itself is not
so much "created anew" through selective breeding and natural selection
as it is modulated according to predetermined outcomes, and corrective
feedback is conducted in a variety of ways to ensure maximum yields of
resistant strains, and to engage an apparatus of both political
influence lobbying to ensure compliance with the genetic modification
mission, and litigation against those farmers who would assert any
autonomy with respect to their own seeds or in any way challenge the
effects of genetic drift and transgene escape. In this way, despite the
heavy emphasis on free modulation, biotech corporations like Monsanto or
Syngenta still have recourse to disciplinary structures such as the
State and its laws, and in some cases can easily outmaneuver the law by
continuing to violate laws that stipulate that GM crops cannot be
planted within a defined distance of certified organic crops.

### Deleuze K -- 1NC Cyberspace Link

#### Cyberspace is the new site of [reterritorialization]{.underline}. The AFFs [attempt]{.underline} to exert [sovereignty]{.underline} generates the conditions for cyberwar to take [place]{.underline}.

**Lambach, 19** \[Daniel Lambach is a political scientist, currently
working as a Heisenberg Fellow at the Research Centre Normative Orders
at Goethe Universität Frankfurt, 5-11-2019, accessed on 7-22-2022,

[States **reterritorialize** the "national territory" in
cyberspace]{.underline}. These territories are cyber-analogies to
physical state territory that solidify states' regulatory reach and
undergird jurisdictional claims. This reterritorialization strategy
proceeds from the normative assumption that all online activity that
occurs "in" a country (because users, servers, or data are "located"
there) should be treated as a part of a corresponding cyberspace
territory. [This belief has been **strengthened** by the growing
popularity of **geolocation technology**, which makes the virtual
coincide with the **physical**. Discourses about "**cybersovereignty**,"
"data sovereignty," or "digital **sovereignty**," which are mainly
championed by Russia and China but also find some traction in countries
like France and Germany, are evidence of this belief]{.underline} (Drake
et al. 2016, 45--48; Fliegauf 2016, 79). There are a variety of
[instruments]{.underline} available to [states seeking to **recreate**
their national **territory** in cyberspace]{.underline}. National
[firewalls are one of the best-known ways for governments to both
**communicate** their **territorial** claim and display power within the
**bounded space**]{.underline}. These firewalls combine a range of
filtering mechanisms like IP blocking and keyword searches to censor
discussions about sensitive topics and deny access to websites deemed
subversive. The "Great Firewall of China" is the best-known example, but
other countries have developed, or are developing, similar systems of
censorship. North Korea is probably the most extreme example, where,
until recently, users could only access the countrywide Kwangmyong
intranet. Today, access to select internet sites is possible under tight
restrictions and government scrutiny. [Internet "kill switches" are the
ultimate display of power. Being able to shut off the entire national
internet, or parts thereof, in a controlled fashion and for extended
periods of time demonstrates the capability of the state]{.underline}
(DeNardis 2014, 199--221). And while this is clearly a tactic of last
resort, there have been shutdowns lasting days or weeks as well as
partial shutdowns targeting parts of the country or certain times of the
day. The difficulty of a shutdown is determined by the network
structure; the smaller the number of "choke points"---for example,
Internet Service Providers and autonomous systems---the easier it is for
state actors to accomplish (Roberts et al. 2011; Belson 2017). Data
localization laws have also become very popular in recent years in the
wake of the Snowden revelations.[12 Their stated aim is to **safeguard**
data **protection** for citizens and corporations, mandating "that
certain types of data collected in a **particular** country be stored
and/or processed **within** that country]{.underline}" (Bowman 2015) and
regulating which companies are allowed to manage these kinds of data
based on whether the corporation falls under national jurisdiction. As
Baur-Ahrens points out, the routing and storage requirements of such
laws require "changes to the basic functioning of the underlying
Internet infrastructure" (Baur-Ahrens 2017, 37). [National firewalls,
kill switches, and data localization laws reinforce **container notions
of territorial statehood**. They clearly communicate **territorial**
boundaries and openly display state control over
**territory**]{.underline}. Another way of reifying the "national"
territory is through country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs), such as
.ru, .cn, or .de, which symbolically connect a virtual domain to a
country (Mueller and Badiei 2017), although this mostly applies to
larger countries. States like Tuvalu or Tonga are marketing their
ccTLDs, .tv and .to, globally without reterritorializing a "national"
territory in cyberspace. Nonetheless, ccTLDs have legal repercussions:
domain name registries---that is, the agencies administering
ccTLDs---typically mandate through their terms and conditions that
registrants of a "national" domain follow national laws. N[otions of
cyberwar, cyberdefense, and cyber deterrence also **reterritorialize**
cyberspace into separate state "**containers**."13 First, such
discourses and strategies reify certain network nodes]{.underline}---for
example, CIR or [national assets associated with **military** or
intelligence **branches** of the state]{.underline} (Stevens 2012,
151)---as forming an integral part of a "national territory," any attack
on which is considered grounds for retaliation. [Cyberwar strategists
often point out the risks that hostile cyber operations can pose for
infrastructure in **physical** space---for example, electrical grids,
financial networks, or railways---thus connecting the "national
cyber-territory" with the physical state territory]{.underline} (Warner
2012, 795--98). Second, "[cyberwar" in the narrowest sense of the term
is a practice **conducted** by states and state proxi]{.underline}es
(Lupovici 2016, 326--27[). The literature is consistent in reserving
this term for **hostilities** between states, whereas actions by/on
private actors are commonly described as "cyber attacks" or "cyber
operations."]{.underline} [**Cyberwar** and the **state** territorial
container in cyberspace are **mutually constitutive**. This is why
national security apparatuses have proclaimed cyberspace to be the
"fifth domain of warfare]{.underline}" (after land, sea, air, and space)
(Manjikian 2010, 384--88; Dunn Cavelty 2015). [As a result, many
countries have expanded or are expanding their **cyberdefense** and
cyberwarfare capabilities]{.underline} (Fliegauf 2016, 79; Mueller 2017,
73--77[). The division of **"inside" and "outside**" is also important
in doctrinal debates about **cyberdefense**. In other words, should
cyberdefense be solely about **protecting** the "territory," or should
it also include **active** measures ("active defense," "hacking back")
that reach beyond the **territory** and **deterritorialize** the site of
conflict?]{.underline} Beyond these various instruments, there are
nascent, and as yet unrealized, possibilities to make cyberspace map
even closer to offline geographies by revising fundamental protocols
that govern the internet\'s functionality (Mueller 2017, 81--84). One
such proposal would be to move the domain name system (DNS), which
translates domain names into the numerical format that the internet
protocol uses, from a global system into a system of interconnected
national domain name systems, substantially increasing the scope for
control by national regulators. In the words of three leading internet
experts, this would create "the mother of all fragmentations" (Drake et
al. 2016, 28). [Beyond this reterritorialization of cyberspace into
**state** containers, some states, given the **requisite** resources and
**power**, can also create **regulatory territorie**s, which expand the
reach of a state\'s laws and regulations in **extraterritorial**
way]{.underline}s.14 [The structure of cyberspace and of internet
governance makes such a **differentiated** approach possible, even
necessary. States have great control over infrastructure localized in
their country but **little control** over global aspects of
cyberspace]{.underline}. However, very powerful countries like the
United States or coalitions like the EU can hope to make
extraterritorial claims stick. [Creating regulatory territories
typically rests on an expansive claim to jurisdiction. Jurisdiction was
and is typically assigned according to the **location** of a particular
act or one of its constituent elements.]{.underline} Cyberspace has
substantially complicated this line of legal reasoning because it is
very easy to claim "territorial contacts and thus jurisdiction, for
example, on the basis of where the server is located, where the content
is viewed, where the content is uploaded, where the content is
deliberately directed to, where effects are felt, etc." (Ryngaert 2015,
63; see also Berman 2002). [Absent a rule for adjudicating between
jurisdiction claims, there are few legal limits on states' claims for
quasi-global regulatory territories.]{.underline} For instance, there is
an ongoing dispute between the French Data Protection Agency (CNIL) and
Google relating to the EU "Right to be Forgotten," where the CNIL
demands that Google enforce its orders to delist personal information
relating to a claimant from Google\'s search results globally, not just
for users geolocated in the EU (Daskal 2018, 214--88). [This
multiplicity of regulatory territories and the lack of clear rules for
dispute resolution has recently sparked debates about the necessity of
norms to regulate cyberspace]{.underline} (Svantesson 2016), [especially
in the fields of **cyberdefense** and **cybersecurity**
(]{.underline}Finnemore and Hollis 2016; Schmitt 2017; Taddeo 2018).
While the practical impact of these discussions has been arguably
shallow, at least thus far, a norms approach is instructive for an
appreciation of some deeper dynamics. Put very simply[, there is an
ongoing and unresolved process of norm contestation between a
**multistakeholder** approach and a multilateral model of internet
governance, much of which turns on whether extraterritorial regulatory
territories are **permissible**]{.underline}. The multistakeholder
approach has been the prevalent model of internet governance since the
1990s and emphasizes the inclusion of private actors in policymaking,
limited influence of governments, and a decentralized architecture of
the internet (Carr 2015). [It is most clearly expressed by the United
States and, with some variation, their Western allies. The second
position is informed by ideas of **cybersovereignty** and argues for a
more **state-centric** form of **governance**, mediated by
**intergovernmental organizations** like the United Nations (UN) or the
International Telecommunications Union (ITU). This position is
championed by Russia and China, who believe that "multi-stakeholderism
is a front for **maintaining** Western-centric **dominance** of this new
'**global commons'**"]{.underline} (Lantis and Bloomberg 2018, 156) a[nd
does not respect national sovereignty]{.underline} (Aronczyk and
Budnitsky 2017; Wei 2017; see also Warner 2012, 792--93; Maurer 2017,
50--67). This debate has been going on for more than two decades and has
shaped institutional developments in internet governance. Notable sites
of contestation include the United Nations General Assembly\'s First
Committee since 1998 (Tikk-Ringas 2012), the 2003 and 2005 World Summits
on the Information Society, and the annual, UN-endorsed Internet
Governance Forum, inaugurated in 2006. In 2011, Russia, China,
Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan proposed an international code of conduct for
information security to the UN General Assembly, later elaborated into a
proposal to the ITU World Conference on International Telecommunications
(WCIT) in 2012, that the ITU International Telecommunications
Regulations treaty be amended to include the internet under its ambit.
This would have given the ITU substantial authority over many aspects of
internet governance. The WCIT fell apart when the two camps failed to
find an agreement, prompting the United States delegates to walk out of
the meeting, although some contentious issues were later resolved at the
2014 ITU Plenipotentiary Meeting. [These disputes can be read as
competition among "territorial projects," with repercussions down to the
level of infrastructure. The multilateralists envision a more vertically
integrated internet of state territories and interstate cooperation.
The]{.underline} multistakeholderists prefer a more open, decentralized
internet, where states and private stakeholders work together. The
latter position is much more comfortable with regulatory territories,
whereas the former views these as encroaching on national territories
(Aronczyk and Budnitsky 2017). But the opposition between these
positions should not be overstated---as much as China wishes to maintain
control over "its" portion of cyberspace, it is aware of the economic
and commercial significance of the internet (Lantis and Bloomberg 2018,
158). This was also visible in the UN Group of Governmental Experts on
Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the
Context of International Security (UN GGE). Since 2004, expert groups
have discussed various security-related issues regarding information and
telecommunications. And even though the 2017 meeting failed
acrimoniously, it should not be forgotten that the 2013 and 2015
meetings had agreed that international law, including the UN Charter,
applied to cyberspace as well (Sukumar 2017) and that the use of proxies
in offensive cyberoperations should be discouraged (Maurer 2017, 5). [A
**territorialization** perspective on states in cyberspace challenges
the "internet fragmentation" view of states **erecting** hard boundaries
that will **inevitably destroy the internet** as we know it, although
these arguments are not without merit. We do see efforts to recreate
"container" notions of state territories in cyberspace, but these are in
tension with "extraterritorial" regulatory spaces. In contrast to
narratives of states "colonizing" the cyber-frontier]{.underline} (Saco
1999), [the reterritorialization of state territories in cyberspace is a
more complex and conflictual process and does not necessarily create
"hard" boundaries.]{.underline}

What both were challenging was the difficulty of transferring a landed
way of 'doing business' to sea in respect of the dynamism of the sea and
mobility of life within it. [They were presenting alternative
geophilosophies (geographically de-territorialized modes of thinking)
and different ontologies (of a world not rooted, but
mobile)]{.underline}. The sea, both sets of authors argued, is
geophysically liquid, mobile, three-dimensional. You can draw a line on
map, but not the ocean itself. You can attempt to designate a zone, but
the sea and life at sea move \[61,62\]. [More so, because the deep sea
is legally an international space and for the most part is beyond state
jurisdiction, it cannot be territorialized in the same way (although
this, of course, does not stop some from trying; see]{.underline}
\[6\]). These [different modes of knowing and understanding, of fluid
geophilosophies and '**wet'** ontologies---of
**de**-**territorialization**---unlock different **potentials** for
'doing' **governance**.]{.underline} In late 2016, I began a project
searching for examples where less mainstream governance regimes were
being developed. These were ways of organizing the marine realm that had
mobilized a radically different ontology from the territorializing,
grounded practices typical of ocean management. [It is, of course,
difficult to search for such approaches that diverge from the accepted,
dominant regimes of marine governance.]{.underline} Indeed, where do you
start to find 'experimental' modes of managing the seas and oceans, and
the activities, and life, within them? Such an approach requires looking
beyond the 'trap', as Elden calls it \[42\], that can be territory. As
Elden urges, we need to start from a point of looking beyond accepted
knowledge regimes \[42\]. [This requires a substantial cognitive shift
to recognize our own indoctrination in the reproduction of such traps.
Instead we must be aware of how this 'constrains our thinking' and
'hamstrings our potential for critique']{.underline} (\[42\], p. 757).
Undertaking this work creates space to see or make [visible other
organizations of governance.]{.underline} This can occur [through a
tracing of stories, a listening to new narratives, an openness to future
scenarios, built through an array of data including official records,
archives, mind maps, interviews, oral histories and other qualitative as
well as quantitative data sources, including modes of scenario formation
to imagine oceans differently through time (for the latter see
\[63\]).]{.underline} The Bering Strait is a narrow seaway of 44
nautical miles positioned between the landmasses of Russia and the
American archipelago of Alaska \[64\]. It was an area with little
explicit marine governance, in part because it has not been a well-used
global transport route (although it has, historically been a 'nexus' for
localized trading, something typically ignored in contemporary
governance developments; see \[65\]). Yet with climate change, ice melt,
and an increasingly viable passage emerging, vessel traffic is
increasing and with it risks to marine life \[65\]. Indeed, as the Pew
Charitable Trust have noted, this poses unique challenges for, a highly
productive marine ecosystem... Almost the entire western Arctic
population of bowhead whales travels through the strait twice a year. It
also provides important food for the Pacific Walrus, spectacled eider,
and grey whales. An estimated 12 million seabirds nest or forage in the
area each year. The strait is also home to indigenous communities whose
inhabitants have lived a traditional way of life along its shores for
untold generations. \[64\] With ecosystem threats owing to ship strikes,
noise, discharge and contamination \[65\], efforts began to consider
mechanisms to mitigate potential harm. In 2010, the United States
Coastguard (USCG) began a consultation regarding the implementation of a
ship routeing scheme for the Bering Strait to guide increased shipping
traffic. Although pertaining to mobility---guiding the movement of ships
along a corridor---the technique of governance planned and proposed
rested on the very static, fixed, territorializing and grounded modes of
spatial management typical in marine environments. A maritime motorway,
suggested through the USCG Port Access Route Study, would create a
static corridor, cut through space, mapped onto the ocean as a surficial
device of management. It was a solution that sought to fix in space
governance, in a realm of mobility, where whales, walrus, fish, ice, all
move. Against this backdrop, an organization, a Marine Exchange was
already working with a different geophilosophy and ontology. The Marine
Exchange of Alaska (MXAK), a non-governmental, not-for-profit
organization that has been operating since 2001, embodies a networked
approach to maritime domain awareness. Through a process of information
dissemination to help guide users of the marine environment, it is also
flexible and responsive to the very mobile and dynamic environment in
which it operates, sharing information in 'real-time'. As Captain Ed
Page, director of the MXAK noted, this presents a radically different
way of thinking about how we protect and conserve the Bering Strait. So
my point is I think the best way to manage places like the Bering Strait
is actually send information ... using this new technology, warn those
at risk... you can say 'you can go through the Bering Strait but here\'s
the guidelines now, just stay this far away from shore and ... we\'ll
let you know where you can go when you get there because it\'s a dynamic
situation (Captain Ed Page, unpublished interview, 5 November 2016).
[Built through **networks**---of **satellites**, weather stations, radar
sites, ships, **processed** AIS data from the Marine Exchange building,
the desk **operators**, the **environment** itself, **fog**, **rain**,
**sun**, **mobile** **marine** life, ice floes---the **organization** of
space emerges through an **ethos of knowledge** sharing that has no
**discrete territorialized boundaries** built on landed **assumptions**,
but reflects the very relational and connected nature of the marine
**environment** and the human and more-than-human 'actants' using the
**space** (see also \[24\]). It works on a networked ontology responsive
to 'earthly' processes and relations. This de-territorialized, open,
networked geophilosophy **provides** us with an arguably less areal,
flat **ontology** for thinking about governance]{.underline}. By
comparison, [it provides us with a spherical, three-dimensional,
**imaginary**, where the earth is connected in a system of **related**,
networked, **assembled** and co-constituted parts; where the 'earth' is,
as Elden notes 'in **flux, dynamic, indeterminate**, and changeable,
rather than **static** and fixed' (\[66\], p. xiv).]{.underline} We
might think of the Bering example not as a territorialized zone of
management---a cartographic, fixed, mode of stewarding space---but an
'open building site' (to quote \[67\], p. 65). Although, to be clear,
the MXAK is not a formal governance actor in Alaska (it is an NGO
offering services for stewardship over the marine environment) it offers
us, by example, a radically different view of how we might 'do'
governance based on dismantling dominant territorial discourses. As
Callon notes, an actor-network provides 'more an inspirational frame
than a constraining theoretical system... (which) postulates between
humans and nonhumans... (in) the configuration of sociotechnical
network' (\[67\], p. 62). As Captain Page noted, ...with AIS
(technology) you can actually send information to vessels, an icon or a
box and explain what it is by visually showing the issue, like, 'this is
an area to be avoided because of the presence of whale... Reduce your
speed or give it a wide berth'. Or, 'there\'s a presence of ice here, so
you want to avoid that ice because your vessel is not configured or not
designed to operate in those icy conditions (unpublished interview, 5
November 2016). Of course, such systems are based on goodwill and
collaboration that might not be transferable to all examples, but it
demonstrates an approach that exceeds \[27\] the limits of existing
marine strategies. Indeed, although a very distinct example, it makes
visible the possibility of a different way of doing governance. As
Maxwell et al. note, a shift towards dynamic ocean management... defined
as management that rapidly changes in space and time in response to
changes in the ocean and its users through the integration of near
real-time biological, oceanographic, social and/or economic data.... can
refine the temporal and spatial scale of managed areas, thereby better
balancing ecological and economic objectives. (\[60\], p. 42)

There is, of course[, a need to be just as cautious about these
de-territorialized developments in marine managemen]{.underline}t.
Captain Page posits that 'new' approaches should not necessarily replace
old ones with de-territorialized modes supplanting territorialized ones.
Indeed, as noted, there is quite some evidence that conservation
enclosures 'work'. [Decisions on how to manage the]{.underline} marine
[environment]{.underline} should be [based on the particularities of the
situation: the balance between protecting the ecosystem, the economy,
livelihoods and more-than-**human** oceanic life]{.underline}. In some
scenarios, depending on the purpose of governance and the desired goals,
zoning may be optimal; in others, not. As Captain Page noted, 'I mean
the funny thing is that sometimes these things \[dynamic approaches\]
don\'t replace something else, they just complement and supplement. They
have different capabilities and different features\' (Captain Ed Page,
unpublished interview, 5 November 2016). [There is also a need to be
cautious about any **assumed** benefits of **de-territorialized**
approaches vis-à-vis their territorial predecessors.]{.underline} As
Maxwell and colleagues note, [there is still a '**gap'** in some of the
data **needed** to make responsive techniques workable]{.underline}
(\[60\], see also \[68\]). [They also rely on the dependability of
technological apparatus (satellite tracking systems and such like). In
addition, there is a need to ensure that legal frameworks can support
such **developments** where necessary]{.underline} (\[60\], p. 42).
Boucquey and colleagues argue a point further, noting that we should be
careful that the data driving such responsive or flexible processes
aren\'t themselves making 'durable' new kinds of ocean knowledge
(\[10\], p. 484). [Data are always the **mirror** of their **creator**,
not the world itself, and this can bring with it **challenges** in
respect of **reliability**, especially where the **data** for such
processes derive from **portals** of]{.underline} oceanic
**[information]{.underline}** [collected and collated by various
agencies each with vested (political) interests in how the marine
environment is used and protected]{.underline} (and for whom)
\[69--71\]. Indeed, while governance does involve a broad range of
actors (\[2\], p. 317), it is not an equal process. In attempting to
include a variety of sectors---humanitarian organizations; ocean
conservancy NGOs; private companies; and beyond---governance is said to
be 'bottom-up' rather than 'top-down' in developing modes of organizing,
managing and governing people, activities and spaces. As such, the voice
of much ocean policy tends to speak in a collective 'we' that represents
all. Consider, for example, the strapline to the UN Decade of Ocean
Science: 'the science we need, for the ocean we want' (\[53\], emphasis
added). But who is that 'we'? What science is needed by different
actors, and what kind of ocean do different people desire? Governance,
management and policy, accountable as they may try to be, do not ensure
every voice is heard and every perspective is accounted for (see
Flannery et al. on MSP, \[15,16\] and the recent report on the latest
BBNJ Intergovernmental Conference on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond
National Jurisdiction, for example, where some nations and perspectives
were unable to participate fully \[72\]). It is necessary to consider
the discourses of territory and regimes of power within which territory
as a 'political technology' sits \[4\]. [Territorializing practice is a
political means of taking and **appropriating** space]{.underline}
\[5,73\]. Modes of ocean governance [that are territorial, then, are not
politically innocent---they involve the **allocation** and even
**seizing** of space for a particular purpose (even where that purpose
may be **situated** as a 'greater good').]{.underline} In 2014, the
Transnational Institute (TNI), Masifundise Development Trust and Afrika
Kontakt laid out a brochure highlighting practices of ocean---the
snatching of space through schemes such as MPAs, which while situated as
beneficial for ocean protection and conservation, can by-pass the needs,
experiences, knowledge and uses of local indigenous populations in
relation to their ocean space \[75\]. Indeed, planning and conservation
practices based on territorializing logics hold with them colonial
traces where territories were first established through the violent land
grabs of colonial and imperial enterprise (see \[74\], p. 10). It is
important to go back and engage critically with these histories in the
context of present day and future-oriented governance and management
strategies to unsettle such approaches \[74\]. [Moreover, it is
important that a homogeneous 'we' (a 'we' that is often a **white**,
**western**, and predominantly **male**) also steps back from the work
of **governance**, not just to include, but reorientate entirely
approaches to ocean **governance** through decolonialism. Only this has
the potential to truly '**transform'** the ocean for
sustainability.]{.underline}

#### The AFFs process of mapping is [rooted]{.underline} in the desire for control over territory.

[There are different ways of conceptualising 'space']{.underline}. The
first is to view it in a Cartesian sense, that is, a geometric container
that other things exist or happen in. Cartesianism is the foundation of
geo-determinism, which is encapsulated in the old aphorism that
'geography is destiny'. Geo-determinism was characteristic of classical
geopolitics but was falling out of favour in Political Geography as
early as the 1940s. It was replaced by a possibilist understanding of
geography, wherein geography is constant but its social impact is
mediated by politics, technology, and other factors. [Both determinist
and possibilist approaches are based on a fixed understanding of space,
thereby making **geography** little more than a 'territorial **stage'**
upon which states interact]{.underline}. In Geography and Sociology,
space is today viewed in relational and social constructivist terms, as
the result of interactions among phenomena, objects, and people. Doreen
Massey argues that 'identities/entities, the relations "between" them,
and the spatiality which is part of them, are all
co-constitutive'.Footnote67 Martina Löw speaks of space as 'a relational
arrangement of bodies that are incessantly in motion'.Footnote68 Löw\'s
use of 'arrangement' implies order, in spite of space\'s inherent
dynamism. Therefore, spaces are reflective of other sociopolitical
structures and why 'social and political practices are co-implicated in
different spatial manifestations'.Footnote69 In short, spaces are
constructed. While earlier scholarship in Human Geography aimed to
identify spaces, its current approach is to understand the social
process by which spaces come to exist.Footnote70 This constructivist
approach focuses on the process of space making and is particularly
associated with scholarship in critical geopolitics, border studies, and
feminist geography.Footnote71 [Spaces are not independent of physical
**environments**,]{.underline} as the discussion of Simmel\'s relational
sociology highlights. Gazit speaks of space -- [the '**dynamic** webs of
**socio-cultural** and **symbolic** relations' -- evolving within,
around, and in relation to 'brute topographical physical
settings'.]{.underline} Stuart Elden refers to these [settings as
'terrain', which consists of geophysical landscapes, a built
environment, and their respective material and physical
properties]{.underline}. [Terrain exists as part of, and in relation to
human societies and is therefore malleable, constantly shaping and being
shaped by social action.]{.underline} In line with much geographic
writing, [I approach space as an abstract and general construct and
other geographical concepts as more specific kinds of space. For
instance, 'places' are spaces that have social purposes and
meanings]{.underline}. Places are created through shared memories and
are enmeshed in wider social relations; in the words of Setha Low,
places are the 'spatial location of subjectivities, intersubjectivities
and identities'.Footnote74 As other spaces, places are productive and
play their part in the constitution of gender and other social
identities. [To give another example, territory is politically
controlled and bounded space. Territories have three
**characteristics**: The first is a 'classification by
area]{.underline}'. Second, [territorial claims have to be communicated,
for example by reification of a space and the symbolic marking of
borders in space and on maps]{.underline}. Third, [territoriality always
implies an attempt at enforcing claims of control]{.underline}. In sum[,
territoriality should be understood as 'the attempt by an individual or
group to affect, influence, or control people, phenomena, and
relationships, by delimiting and asserting control over a geographic
area']{.underline}. '[Territory' should not be restricted to terrestrial
spaces but also look to those spaces -- oceanic, atmospheric, **outer
space**, **cyberspace** -- beyond the familiar environment of
terra]{.underline}.

[The **transformation** and **reinvention** of state violence has
**continued** into the digital age.]{.underline} The clearest
[manifestation of state violence in cyberspace is in **offensive**
**cyber** capabilities: the adversarial **manipulation** of **digital**
devices and networks for interstate **competition** and globalised
**repression**]{.underline}. However, the literature on OCCs is
dominated by a narrow definition of violence as bodily harm, classifying
[OCCs as largely non-violent]{.underline}. [This narrow definition has
both **analytical** and **policy** consequences.]{.underline}
Analytically[, it implies undue homogeneity across the wide range of
strategically relevant uses of **OCCs**. At a policy level, it means
that many harms caused by OCCs are un- or under-appreciated by
**states** and other **actors**.]{.underline} The account provided here
provides greater analytical purchase on this expanding domain, as well
as stronger normative foundation for action[. An **expanded** concept of
violence, including **affective** and community harms, reveals how OCCs
**relocate** state violence through new means of **repression** and
information **manipulation**, without **simplifying** or
**exaggerating** their complex effects]{.underline}. Some readers may
object that expanding the definition of violence is hazardous, diluting
the devastating effects violent actions have on their victims and their
communities. While we recognise this danger, we aim to show that the
opposite is also true. [Holding on to a narrow **definition** of
violence leads one to **misconstrue** the harms resulting from the use
of OCCs to the **detriment** of their victims.]{.underline} Further
research is required to substantiate this relocation with empirical
data, including large-scale surveys of cyber conflict and extended case
studies that trace the decision-making processes behind individual
deployments. Further work is also needed to transfer this account of
violence from states to semi- and non-state actors, as well as to
examine the justifications for violent uses of OCCs in more detail. This
article has three main implications for theory and policy on cyber
conflict. First, [the **affective** and community harms **caused** by
OCCs need to be **identified**, anticipated, and taken **seriously** in
decisions about their **use**]{.underline}. Second, [research and policy
should focus on the most violent uses of OCCs, which may not be
**state-sponsored** cyber-espionage or sabotage, but instead the
adaption of authoritarian systems to rely on digital and **globalised
repression** and rework existing practices of **information
manipulation** against their adversaries]{.underline}. Third, and most
importantly, [adherence to a narrow conception of **violence** means
that many states have undertaken **significant** **harmful** **actions**
in their own and each other\'s societies without recognising them as
such. Our current conceptual tools hamper institutional adaptation to
counter and mitigate these broader harms, such as military doctrines and
capabilities, intelligence capabilities, criminal laws, police support,
victim counselling, and so on.]{.underline} Our redrawing of the
[concept of violence to include affective and community harms provides
defensive actors with a stronger conceptual foundation to accurately
measure harms exerted via digital means and then act to prevent
them.]{.underline} Are OCCs the better angels of our digital nature[? We
have argued that they are not; on an expanded concept of violence, OCCs
represent not Pinkerian optimism, but a more complex relocation of state
violence]{.underline}. The main contribution of this article is thus the
application of an expanded conception of violence to better understand
the impact of OCCs on individuals and societies. But the account of
violence put forward here also has broader implications. [Many other
emerging security technologies, such as lethal autonomous weapons
systems, raise similar questions about the extent and type of violence
they cause, in part due to their reliance on informational as well as
material means to produce harmful effects]{.underline}. The expansion of
the concept of violence we have undertaken in this article could also be
applied to other information-enabled technologies, to identify and
ultimately work to ameliorate currently [unseen forms of harm in global
politics. Consequently, in addition to its main contribution in
rethinking the **violence** involved in cyber conflict, our study also
provides new insights into how to best **conceptualise violence** in
international affairs more widely.]{.underline}

**The United States is on an endless quest for absolute security. Not
only is this state unobtainable, but justifies endless interventions for
the purpose of enjoying the loss of war.**

of Vermont, Enjoying What We Don't Have: The Political Project of
Psychoanalysis, pp. 159-161) EG

[Nowhere is [the retreat from enjoyment to pleasure]{.mark} more
[evident]{.mark} than [in the American response to]{.mark} the attacks
of [September 11]{.mark}, 2001]{.underline}. The [[attacks]{.mark}
immediately [reinvigorated the social bond for]{.mark} a majority of
[Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}. The loss that they occasioned brought
subjects back to the shared sacrifice that defines their membership in
American society. Even as they were horrified by the image of the towers
burning and then falling, most [[Americans]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the
strict psychoanalytic sense of the term, [[enjoyed the attacks]{.mark}
insofar [as the attacks allowed them to experience]{.mark} once again
[their social bond]{.mark} with great intensity.]{.underline}

This is a bond that one suffers, just as one suffers from a terrorist
attack. Even though it followed from an attack, this bond was not one
formed through the male logic of friend/enemy, which is why the headline
in *Le Monde* on September 12, 2001, could proclaim, "Nous sommes tous
Américains."27 The bond formed around the September 11 attacks was not
initially a bond of exclusivity with a clear outside and inside. Any
subject willing to accede to the experience of loss could become a part
of American society at that moment. The not-all of the social bond
occurs through the experience of loss, but the recognition of this type
of bond is unbearable. One enjoys it without deriving any pleasure from
it. It is, in fact, painful. Not only is it painful, but it also entails
complete humiliation. The society experiences the shame of being a
victim and enduring trauma --- the shame of enjoyment itself.

In order [[to disguise]{.mark} this [shameful enjoyment, the United
States]{.mark} quickly [turned to an assertion of power that would
carry]{.mark} with it the [promise of a restored wholeness --- the
recovery of an imaginary perfect security]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
[[attack on Afghanistan brought pleasure]{.mark} to most members of
American society.]{.underline} This pleasure had the function of
[[rendering the enjoyment]{.mark} that emerged [through traumatic loss
bearable,]{.mark} but it could not fulfill its inherent
promise]{.underline}. Enjoyment satisfies, and [[pleasure always
disappoints. The disappointing nature of the attack]{.mark} on
Afghanistan [paved the way to]{.mark} the subsequent [attack on
Iraq]{.mark} in a further attempt to find an actual pleasure equal to
what we anticipated]{.underline}. In terms of American society, [these
[foreign wars serve as alibis for the enjoyment of the traumatic attacks
themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}. Because we seek respite from the loss
that binds us, we flee from the social bond despite our purported desire
for it. The authentic social bond exists only in the shared experience
of loss --- that is, only according to the female logic of not-having.

But the attack on Iraq also illustrates the inescapability of the
enjoyment attached to loss. [[The Iraq War clearly follows]{.mark} from
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} [male]{.underline} [[logic of having and aims
at]{.mark} producing the [pleasure]{.mark} resulting [from
possession:]{.mark} the United States would conquer a recalcitrant
dictator and obtain a firm ally in a globally significant
region.]{.underline} This is both the stated justification for the war
and the explanation offered by critics who see it as an exercise in
American imperialism. For both the perpetuators of the war and its
critics, the war concerns having, despite the different inflections they
give this idea. But the result of the war is the failure of having and
the renewed experience of loss. [The pursuit of the pleasure involved in
having returns American society to the traumatic loss involved in the
September 11 attacks]{.underline}. Of course, no one fights wars with
the express intention of losing them, but [[every war brings]{.mark}
with it [sacrifice and loss,]{.mark} which is ultimately [the substance
of the social bond and the source of our ability to enjoy that
bond.]{.mark}]{.underline} The pursuit of the pleasure of having leads
to the loss that inevitably accompanies this pursuit.

Imperial powers do not attempt to stretch their military and economic
reach to the point that it breaks because of an inescapable will to
power or a biological urge for infinite expansion. [The [conquering
drive of empires]{.mark} has its roots in the [search
for]{.mark}]{.underline} what no amount of imperial possession can
provide --- [[the enjoyment of]{.mark} the experience of
[loss]{.mark}]{.underline}. Empires conquer increasing quantities of
territory in order to discover a territory that they can't conquer. In
this same way, [the [Afghanistan War disappointed the American
leadership because it didn't provide even the possibility for
loss]{.mark}. Donald [Rumsfeld's lament that the country didn't have any
targets to bomb points in this direction. Iraq]{.mark}, in contrast,
[promised a possible defeat]{.mark}, and if it hadn't, [Syria or Iran
would surely have come within the sights of the]{.mark} Bush
[administration]{.mark}. Whatever the proffered justification or hidden
motivation, powerful [societies ultimately go to war in order to reenact
a constitutive loss and facilitate the enjoyment that this loss
entails]{.mark}]{.underline}[.28]{.mark}

#### The United States engages in attempts to achieve a fantasy of security as a palliative to its nostalgia for a "lost wholeness".

Terada, "Review: A Politics of the Death Drive", American Imago , Vol.
71, No. 1 (Spring 2014), pp. 89-96)

Drawing political ramifications, [McGowan rejects both the politics of
nostalgia]{.underline}---either progressive or conservative---that seeks
to redeem a lost plenitude and the deconstructionist alternative that
posits a receding horizon of possibility that politics should seek to
keep open. Instead, [he argues for **remaining within rather than
fleeing this recurrent manifestation of loss**]{.underline}, this
condition of masochistic self-wounding that derails our best-laid plans,
for which we then blame others: [Rather than trying to avoid violence,
we can restore to it its proper object---the self. The more the subject
engages in a violent assault on its own forms of symbolic identity, its
own ego, its own deepest convictions, the more the subject finds an
enjoyable alternative to the satisfactions of aggression]{.underline}.
(p. 51) The repetitive return to painful and humiliating experiences of
vulnerability and loss marks the transition to a subject of drive.
Enjoying what we don't have, McGowan argues, opens up the possibility of
a different type of social solidarity, one based on loss, yet open to
infinite possibility.

Politics, Knowledge, and Enjoyment

[McGowan cites the **2001 attack on the World Trade Center** as an
example of an **enjoyment in loss** with direct political bearings. A
social bond emerged through an experience of collective
loss]{.underline}, such that the headlines of French newspapers
proclaimed on that day, "Nous sommes tous Américains" (p. 160). However,
precisely [because a return to a foundational experience of loss is
traumatizing, the subject seeks to escape this unbearable enjoyment and
instead finds something pleasurable to disavow it]{.underline} (p. 38).
[Because enjoyment of loss is a painful, shameful, humiliating
experience, the **United States quickly covered over the loss and turned
to an assertion of imperial will** "that would carry with it the promise
of a restored wholeness---the **recovery of an imaginary perfect
security**"]{.underline} (p. 160). For a brief moment, [a social
solidarity emerged around this loss, but at that precise moment, too,
forces were deployed that carried the promise---and **nostalgia---of
restoring a lost wholeness**.]{.underline} Reflecting upon the social
context in which these conflicting responses occurred, McGowan discusses
the relevance of the [proximity of the real other]{.underline}. The
decline of grandiose figures representing the lawful order---such as the
local parish priest, the politician, or the leader of the local business
community who doubles as the local football coach---has led more and
more to a decline in prohibitions and common symbolic mediations, all of
which has given rise to the unbearable proximity of the other and the
ideology of tolerance through which we mediate this new proximity.
Tolerance, however, simply strips away otherness, so that we do not
encounter the other in its real dimension, in other words, unmediated by
a symbolic structure (p. 117). Tolerance, McGowan argues, stands in the
way of a radical ethical posture. Paradoxically, [the fantasy of
enjoyment that the xenophobe constructs around the other "permits an
encounter with the real other that liberal tolerance forecloses...The
ethical position thus involves sustaining the liberal's tolerance within
the conservative's encounter with the real other]{.underline}" (p. 120).

to control the conditions for presence and absence, enjoying not the
outcome but the exercise of subjectivity itself in the capacity to act
and to choose]{.underline}. **[[Subjectivity requires]{.mark} the
[sacrifice of continuity]{.mark} [through the formation]{.mark} [of the
alienating identity]{.mark} of the mirror phase,]{.underline}** a
process explained more in Chapters 1 and 2. [Discontinuous subjects are
organized in part around the lack]{.underline}---something that would
make them whole again, represented in an object that is never more than
a partial stand-in for this missing completion. Frustrated in the quest
for something outside, [[we enjoy our own
subjectivity]{.underline}]{.mark}.2 In [the context of nuclear war, this
meant ever [more sophisticated simulations]{.mark} of a phenomenon about
which we remained basically uncertain. This is the second movement of
desire]{.underline} in (or **[[for) the Bomb]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
[enjoyment of our reasserted control over 2 "[Enjoyment]{.mark}" is
meant here in the Lacanian sense of jouissance, [not as
happiness]{.mark} [or fulfillment]{.mark}, [but as]{.mark} an
[attachment]{.mark} to something [that]{.mark} often [exceeds
pleasure]{.mark} and [manifests in]{.mark} quite [harmful
ways]{.mark}]{.underline}. 10 **[the Bomb manifested in the repeated
attempts to simulate its use and predict its aftermath.]{.underline}**
The fort-da game described by Freud and explained here in the first two
chapters is an important tool for unpacking this dynamic because it
posits a sense of control over presence and absence as the condition for
a subject's enjoyment. Fort-da refers to the game in which a child makes
an object disappear and reappear in succession, simulating her or his
mother's coming and going and the possibility of her eventual
disappearance. **[[Enjoyment comes]{.mark} from the subject's [control
over]{.mark} these [states of presence]{.mark} and absence, a small
example of imposing order in a world of seeming chaos]{.underline}**
(Freud, Beyond the Pleasure Principle 13-17). [Understanding this is
necessary to draw the common threads between the cold-blooded excesses
of Pentagon nuclear plans, the compulsion that leads survivalists to
stockpile rooms]{.underline} full of MREs, and the [appeal that
apocalyptic videogames hold for millions of players]{.underline}. Ins
all of [these pursuits, the world is made absent in the fantasy of
destruction and present again in the myth of reconstruction, survival,
and rebirth]{.underline}. Nuclear **[[weapons scholarship]{.mark}
[evinces]{.mark} its own [compulsion to repeat]{.mark}: myriad
[investigations]{.mark} of nuclear texts [are done]{.mark}, but [each
leaves something unanswered]{.mark}. The [movements of desire]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} [incompletely]{.mark} by scholarship on nuclear weapons
[concerned only with]{.mark} [exposing the truths]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
nuclear [danger]{.mark}, analyzing specific instantiations of nuclear
rhetoric, or developing a vocabulary for democratic political
resistance.]{.underline}** While the instrumental and political aspects
of language are important, to focus too narrowly on specific discourses
threatens to neglect the forest for the trees. The political movements
that attracted great attention in the 1980s---opposition to the
Strategic Defense Initiative, the Nuclear Freeze Movement, and the
radical disarmament movement---were at best partial successes. This is
not to say that these movements or 11 their scholarly treatments are
unimportant---they are certainly helpful for those concerned with
nuclear activism and decisionmaking. Still, [even if we slowly trace an
asymptotic relation to the zero of nuclear desire, part of the process
is recognizing the pull this unattainable zero has on our efforts to
track it and how those investments sustain the larger discourse of
nuclear warfare]{.underline}. That **[[larger system]{.mark}
[persists]{.mark} almost [unchanged]{.mark}, [with thousands of
weapons]{.mark} [prepared for launch]{.mark} on short notice, an
[endless profusion of war plans]{.mark}, an official policy [to
secure]{.mark} [peace]{.mark} [through]{.mark} the threat of
[genocide]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} almost complete [public
ignorance]{.mark} that the sword of Damocles still hangs from its
slender thread.]{.underline}** The primary difference between nuclear
awareness in 1985 and 2015 as it relates to their own weapons is that
ever fewer citizens of the nuclear states even bother to check how much
the rope is fraying. In other words, the [material artifice of nuclear
warfighting persists despite repeated attempts to understand its
persuasive elements. Existing attempts to study nuclear weapons could
benefit from the concept of the death drive as a problematic for
communication studies.]{.underline}

#### The aff sustains the 'nuclear priesthood' of debate -- in an attempt to control the absolute contingency of the Real, we repetitively invest in a practice of control over nuclear weapons. The 1AC's enjoyment of nuclear weapons becomes a form of violent repetition compulsion that turns the case. 

**Matheson 15** (Calum Matheson is an Assistant Professor of
Communication at the University of Pittsburgh, "Desired Ground Zeroes:
Nuclear Imagination and the Death Drive," 6/23/15)

The conflation of Symbolic and Real is at the heart of the Bomb. Jacques
Derrida famously wrote that [[nuclear war is]{.mark} "fabulously
[textual]{.mark}," [having no existence outside of the system of
language]{.mark}]{.underline}, which we might broaden to representation,
or better yet, mediation. Derrida argued that [because a total nuclear
war has not taken place and its coming would obliterate the archive, it
can exist only in [its]{.mark} "essential rhetoricity" as a
"[fantasy]{.mark}"]{.underline} or "fable" [that [has]{.mark} [no
referent in reality]{.mark}]{.underline} (Derrida 24-27). Some, like
Masahide Kato, have criticized Derrida on the grounds that nuclear war
has taken place in the form of nuclear testing, part of a larger project
of radioactive colonialism and destruction of indigenous peoples (Kato).
I read this argument a different way. [We do not have to deny that a
nuclear war is in some sense ongoing in order to claim that it has never
happened.]{.underline} The kind of nuclear war imagined by Kistiakowsky
at Trinity can never come to pass because it means the end of everything
on Earth. [The radioactive destruction of native nations does not
qualify as a "total" nuclear war in the minds of strategists
and]{.underline} their [peace activist]{.underline} Doppelgängers
[because the war they imagine is beyond any material referent, only
hinted at by the presence of [the Bomb]{.mark} on Earth. It [represents
both the Real in its punishing materiality and a speculation that could
not exist]{.mark} [anywhere but the human imagination.]{.mark} [The
desire to experience the Real is]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore [bound
to be [frustrated]{.mark}. The final advent of [the Bomb always seems
imminent but is never realized, so obliteration is endlessly
deferred]{.mark}]{.underline}.7 The desire for the Real described in
this chapter is thus a source of inevitable failure and frustration. But
it is only on part of the death drive. [U[nable to meet the Real and
still remain extant as discrete subjects]{.underline}]{.mark}[, taunted
by the continuity that lies over the line of taboo, [our desires
remain.]{.mark} We are dislocated and decentered by the Bomb, but we do
not accept our being as dust and ashes.]{.underline} Instead, [the
subject desirous of the nuclear Real finds its enjoyment in the opposite
fantasy: one of power over the conditions of presence and absence,
mastery of contingency and the Real itself. [This is
the]{.mark}]{.underline} dynamic of Freud's [[fort-da game,]{.mark} and
[in]{.mark} context of [nuclear war, it manifests itself in the
compulsion to repetitively simulate nuclear
destruction]{.mark}.]{.underline} Atmospheric nuclear testing ended for
the USA in 1963. Ultimately only a relatively small number of people
witnessed nuclear explosions anywhere in the world, so inevitably
awareness and imagination of the Bomb's overwhelming presence would
spread in an increasingly mediated form. [War games as rituals helped to
sustain a nuclear priesthood in its (necessarily incomplete) access to
the revealed truth of the Bomb after the end of atmospheric nuclear
testing left its followers merely longing to "feel the
heat."]{.underline} As these technologies gave form to videogames and
ostensibly anti-war simulations, they would democratize access to the
Bomb and cement its force as an organizing metaphor for the Real. Ipsos
Custodes In his "Seminar on the 'Purloined Letter,'" Jacques Lacan wrote
that ["it is the symbolic order which is constitutive for the
subject,"]{.underline} and that [the subject receives "major
determination" from "the itinerary of a signifier"]{.underline} (7). One
is "possessed" by the signifier, a thrall to its agency: "the
signifier's displacement determines subjects' acts, destiny, refusals,
~~blindnesses,~~ success, and fate\...everything pertaining to the
psychological pregiven follows willy-nilly the signifier's train, like
weapons and baggage" (21). One doesn't have to adopt a fully
deterministic attitude towards structure to accept that it is the sign
that speaks through us, not vice versa. [Human agency does not operate
without restriction, but constitutes a negotiation of rules that largely
prescribe our behaviors. In the itinerary of an individual life, one can
see the influence of accreted structures that give it form.]{.underline}
There is perhaps no better example than that of [Vice Admiral Tim
Giardina]{.underline}. Giardina is the former deputy head of the United
States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) at Offutt Air Force Base in
Nebraska, the successor to the Strategic Air Command parodied in Dr.
Strangelove. In June 2013, Giardina [was caught using counterfeit poker
chips at a local casino]{.underline}. It was revealed in the ensuing
investigation that Giardina had spent almost 1,100 hours gambling in an
eighteen-month period. He was such a common sight that other casino
regulars remembered him as "Navy Tim," and recalled comments he had made
about the polygraph requirements for U.S. nuclear forces (he was quoted
as saying that the purpose is really to find out if one is "having sex
with animals or something really crazy"). Giardina was banned from
several casinos but continued to play even after being caught with
counterfeit chips.8 Following an investigation by the Naval Criminal
Investigative Service, he was removed from his post, demoted to Rear
Admiral, and reassigned to Washington (Burns). It is not illegal for
Navy officers to gamble. Vice Admiral [Giardina's habitual compulsion to
play poker did not seem to have any effect on his official
duties]{.underline}. Giardina had to be punished not because his actions
are out of line with the ethos of the Strategic Command, but precisely
because they are not. Giardina enjoyed gambling in poker, but in forging
fake chips, [he seemed to enjoy gambling on gambling: his was a kind of
"meta-gambling,"]{.underline} [taking risks on the rules that regulate
risks.]{.underline}9 In doing so, Giardina exposed what Slavoj Žižek
calls the "obscene supplement" of his system. [[Ideological fantasies
are maintained by disavowing their central, obscene foundation, a
gesture necessary to the function of the fantasy but impossible to
acknowledge, for the lack of distance would collapse the whole
edifice]{.underline}]{.mark} (Žižek 35-36). Admiral Cecil Haney,
commander of STRATCOM, said in recent Congressional testimony that the
core mission of the organization remains to deter attack on the United
States. This means minimizing pervasive uncertainty and risk. In Admiral
Haney's words, "America's nuclear deterrent force provides enduring
value to the nation. It has been a constant thread in the geopolitical
fabric of an uncertain world, providing a moderating influence on
generations of world leaders" (U.S. Senate Comm. on Armed Services,
Statement 7). More directly, it is necessary to identify "where we are
taking risk and where we cannot accept further risk" (U.S. Senate Comm.
on Armed Services, Statement 6). "Risk" and "uncertainty" appear
constantly in Haney's statement, which is a statement for minimizing
chance and developing "contingency plans" to control the consequences of
unforeseen events. [The disturbance of Symbolic order by the contingency
of the Real is met with an attempt to restore order, to respond to
chance with law.]{.underline} Lacan describes this dynamic as the
interplay of tuché and automaton: [Where do we meet this real? For what
we have in the discovery of psycho-analysis is an encounter, an
essential encounter---and appointment to which we are always called with
a real that eludes us\...]{.underline} First, the tuché, which we have
borrowed\...from Aristotle, who uses it in his search for cause. We have
translated it as the encounter with the real. [The real is beyond the
automaton, the return, the coming-back, the insistence of the signs, by
which we see ourselves governed by the pleasure principle. The real is
that which always lies behind the automaton\...it is this that is the
object of]{.underline} \[Freud's\] [concern]{.underline}. (Lacan, Four
Fundamental Concepts, 53-54, italics in original) [This is the central
element of the repetition compulsion. [Driven to make our encounter with
the Real, we are perpetually disappointed, but the Symbolic world of
reality abhors a vacuum]{.mark}. Automaton describes [the endless
attempts to reach the Real which are doomed to failure but cannot be
surrendered, so are repeated again and again.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[These repetitive behaviors thus develop an aspect of order, and
are]{.mark}, paradoxically, [orderly attempts to reach the chaos of
contingency.]{.mark}]{.underline} They are also linked by Lacan
gambling, death, and signification ("Purloined Letter" 28-29). [Nuclear
deterrence can be read in this frame as an attempt to secure the world
against the contingency of the Real, the uncertainty of nuclear
war.]{.underline} It is the STRATCOM automaton's answer to the chaos of
the Bomb's tuché. But the attempt to restore order has at its heart a
desire to encounter the Real. In a history of nuclear defense
intellectuals, Fred Kaplan described them in the 1980s at the height of
their power having come with the mission "to impose order," but lacking
any means to control the wild abandon of the Bomb in a hypothetical war
for which there was no precedent, "in the end, chaos still prevailed"
(Kaplan 391). [Desire is the motive force, and that what we desire
cannot be attained is what requires repetition. When]{.underline} the
[chaos]{.underline} of tuché [reigns]{.underline},
[automaton]{.underline} does not surrender, but [comes to
be]{.underline} an end in itself, [a site of investment. Repetition
itself becomes enjoyable. In repeatedly simulating nuclear
war]{.underline}, defense [[intellectuals who could not experience the
Real of nuclear violence could enjoy the illusion of mastery
over]{.mark} [the terror and fascination inspired by the Real by
appearing to]{.mark} [simulate the conditions of presence and
absence]{.mark}]{.underline}---in this case, the presence of the
world-for-us and its absence in the Bomb's inferno. Langdon Winner
distinguishes between risk (a term prevalent in both nuclear war and
poker) and threat or hazard on these grounds: [[risk always has an
implied benefit to it, an element of desire and an opportunity for
control]{.underline}]{.mark} (145). [There is little empirical basis for
nuclear war simulations and the calculations of probability they rely
on, so nuclear war plans always require a good deal of faith, and thus
to adopt them is a risk]{.underline}---[a calculation of both hazard and
reward]{.underline} (Ghamari-Tabrizi 8). [Their parameters are set
arbitrarily by the personnel who design them. In other words, they are
games of chance in which we also manipulate the rules]{.underline}. This
is the obscene supplement of nuclear deterrence that Vice Admiral
Giardina could not be allowed to reveal: we don't just repeat nuclear
simulations again and again because we think that they will someday be
perfect. [[War games are fun, and we don't always care about the
rules]{.underline}]{.mark}. Poker, after all, was rumored to be the
genesis of game theory at the RAND Corporation, prominent modelers of
nuclear war, and was a favorite pastime of the defense intellectuals who
sought to tame the world with human reason (Arbella 51-53).

Here there are echoes of Freud\'s (1916) idea of \'anticipatory
mourning\' and the associated attacks and spoiling that we will study
below (see p. 72). However, for Searles the natural world is not just a
space for externalizing our conflicts. Rather[, a healthy relationship
to the non-human environment is essential for human psychological
well-being.]{.underline} Furthermore, [[one consequence of]{.mark} our
[**alienation from nature** is]{.mark} an omnipotent **[longing for

Here we are in Klein\'s paranoid-schizoid world, with a primitive ego
unable to differentiate between good and bad mother. While ecologists
portray a good eco-mummy doing battle with bad techno-mummy, things are
not so simple. As we have seen, [civilization (and its
[tech]{.mark}nology) is a defence, a \'good mother\' to **[protect us
from]{.mark} capricious and uncaring mother
[nature]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Freud 1930), but, as Searles suggests,
[we are supposed to accept that \'our good mother is poisoning
us\']{.underline} (Searles 1972: 369).∂ For Searles (1972),
[**[behind]{.mark} both nuclear danger and ecological
[catastrophe]{.mark}** [lies]{.mark} the raw destructiveness Kleinians
link to Thanatos, or]{.underline} what Erich Fromm (1992) understands in
terms of **[[necrophilia]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Searles (1972: 370)
argues that at this level of functioning **[[we project \'our]{.mark}

controllable death from pollution preferable to \'sudden death from
nuclear warfare\' or we might yearn for the quick relief of a nuclear

### Psycho Link -- Hegemony 

#### The affirmative's attempt to construct an American-dominated global system through hegemony is invested in the construct of a "whole" America that sustains itself off Weapon States. In an impossible world of complete hegemony, destruction of subjecthood occurs through the fulfillment of all desire.

The fantasy of Krauthammer's discourse differs notably from fantasies
offered by neoconservatives at other times. In one sense, this is to be
expected. Different times and issues call for different arguments. Yet
many observers note that since the beginning of the movement during the
1970s, one fairly consistent quality of neoconservatism is the
ever-present sense of doom just around the corner and national choices
that are always starkly dichotomous. As Bacevich (2005: 77) wryly
observes, "On the one hand---if the nation disregards the
neoconservative call to action---there is the abyss. On the other
hand---if the nation heeds that call---the possibility of salvation
exists." Krauthammer's text displays many of the usual neoconservative
precepts, such as the primacy of military power and the idea that
American global hegemony is benevolent and beneficial for non-Americans.
[The key tension in Krauthammer's text]{.underline}, though, is [that
the notion of ["chaos" lurking close-by conflicts with]{.mark} the major
thrust of the message of [unipolarity. We can understand]{.mark} the
role of [desire in the discourse through this]{.mark} tension. Rather
than constructing a subject of lack, Krauthammer's discourse largely
constructs a subject much closer to fullness. This, in turn, does not
evoke desire for identification but instead kills desire for
identification.]{.underline} Desire (as understood here) is coextensive
with lack (Fink 1995: 54). To exist as a subject, one must desire.
[[Lack evokes desire, desire drives identification]{.mark}, and only
through identification with the social resources of the Symbolic can
subjects gain the recognition they need to achieve a sense of stability
and security]{.underline}. Krauthammer's discourse presumably does not
spark much desire because the subject it produces is, strictly speaking,
not lacking all that much. As the unipolar power---or, as the subject
"America" is constructed through the fantasy of being a unipolar
power---Krauthammer's discourse includes little desire for something
else that might make the subject feel more secure or more stable. [[As
the unipolar power, the subject "America"]{.mark} already [seems]{.mark}
quite [close to the wholeness of enjoyment in terms of a world of
American-imposed rules]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Now that the Cold War is
over, and now that the only other superpower that remotely had the
capability to impose its own global rules is no more, the
[obstacles]{.mark} to the subject's enjoyment [have largely been
removed]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet the effect of this subject formation
on a receiving audience---in terms of an audience "being positioned (or
having existing positionings reinforced) as complex subjects"
(Fairclough 1992: 135)---depends on the workings of desire. [[Once the
subject approaches the object]{.mark} it believes it desires,
[desire]{.mark} for that specific object [paradoxically begins to fade.
If one were to find the Thing]{.mark} that would truly make one whole,
[desire would die, and subjectivity would
evaporate]{.mark}.]{.underline} The ultimate contingency of our desire
and identifications would set in, and one would cease to be a desiring
subject. As Lacan (1998: 111) argues, "'That's not it' is the very cry
by which the jouissance obtained is distinguished from the jouissance
expected" when one approaches the perceived missing object. Desire is
sustained by not reaching the missing object: "The satisfaction of
desire essentially consists of the preservation of its own
unsatisfaction, since a subject remains a subject only insofar as . . .
he is a desiring lack-of-being that wants-to-be" (Chiesa 2007: 155; see
also Fink 1995: 103). That is, the closer the subject gets to enjoyment,
the more desire fades and the more anxiety sets in, since only through
desire do we have subjectivity, and therefore the more desiring the
subject becomes.5 Indeed, [fantasy's purpose is to ward off anxiety and
contingency: This way enjoyment is kept at a "healthy" distance, not too
far but not too close either; close enough to support the appeal of an
object of identification but far enough from letting us entertain the
vision of full satisfaction as an imminent possibility---something that
would kill desire, induce anxiety, and put identification processes in
danger.]{.underline} (Stavrakakis 2007: 198) Although Krauthammer's
message of unipolarity constructs a discursive subject not lacking all
that much, thus evoking less desire for identification with it than
might otherwise be the case, the fantasy of the "unipolar moment" was
not completely without lack. This is expressed a few ways in the
discourse. First, we can understand the place of object a in this
fantasy as the lack of an American-dominated world, toward which
Krauthammer---and the subject his discourse constructs---is oriented
throughout the text. While the international system is, in Krauthammer's
view, undoubtedly unipolar, it is not unipolar to the extent that every
other state or actor willingly submits to an American-imposed order.
"[[Weapon States]{.mark}" are some of the few states mentioned at all in
the text, presumably because they [are the outlaws that do not conform
to post--Cold War order]{.mark} as defined by the United States. [North
Korea, Iraq, Libya, Argentina, Pakistan, Iran, and South Africa all pose
blockages]{.mark} to American/global order [through their
possession]{.mark} (at the time) [of w]{.mark}eapons of [m]{.mark}ass
[d]{.mark}estruction, even though some of these states were more
threatening than others.]{.underline} The obstacle that these few states
pose to a truly unipolar world---where "we" no longer must "hope for
safety" but can seemingly achieve complete safety---evokes desire to
remove them as obstacles to the fantasy of enjoyment. [Desire is
constructed as pushing toward that elusive object believed to bring the
enjoyment of being a complete subject--- here, understood as an
American-centered world with American-imposed global rules. Although
this object is unattainable (since it is but a Symbolic manifestation of
a void), the subject's fantasy allows it to believe that this object is
attainable. An absolutely [American-dominated global system---a full
subject---is]{.mark} indeed presupposed [to exist were it not
for]{.mark} these few states that pose [an
obstacle]{.mark}.]{.underline} Krauthammer's entire discourse guides the
audience to believe that a truly American-centered world is entirely
plausible and desirable, yet this object of desire that promises
enjoyment does not exist. Not merely the social construction of threat,
[Krauthammer's production of "Weapon States" hinges on the movements of
desire and enjoyment that make possible Self-Other relations. [The
construction of these threats is]{.mark} in one sense, as many
international relations (IR) identity theories would contend[, the
production of a hierarchy of "identities" in which America is
differentiated from those states]{.mark} that are not America or the new
American unipolar world (see Weldes 1999). "Weapon States" here
constitute the opposing side of a binary between those states that are
members of and are perceived to openly welcome the new American world,
and those states [that are not "us."]{.mark}]{.underline} Yet in
contrast to such approaches, more than just the presence of these Others
poses an obvious threat to "us." Consequently, it is not enough merely
to make explicit the binary construction of identities. As Slavoj Žižek
(1993: 206) contends, "It is not sufficient to point out how the . . .
Other presents a threat to our identity. We should rather inverse this
proposition: the fascinating image of the Other gives a body to our own
innermost split, to what is 'in us more than ourselves' and thus
prevents us from achieving full identity with ourselves." In other
words[, the construction of the subject through reference to an
Other---the construction of "America" through reference to "Weapon
States"---is premised on a frustration of the "American" subject of the
discourse. [The fully enjoying subject is]{.mark} an [impossible]{.mark}
project, and "America" and a completely American-dominated global system
are likewise impossible projects, since no social entity can fully
construct itself.]{.underline} The discursive production of "Weapon
States" "gives a body," in Žižek's words, to the ultimate frustration
and incompleteness of the subject in Krauthammer's discourse. These
movements of frustration and desire for a full subject give rise to the
construction of fantasies of Self and Other in Krauthammer's discourse.
This process involves the notion that fantasies often presume that
Others "steal our enjoyment" (Žižek 1997). This subtly appears several
times in Krauthammer's discourse. Although "we" are without a doubt the
only superpower, Krauthammer (1990--91: 29) asserts that "there will
constantly be new threats disturbing our peace." Global stability is
"our" stability, since American domination is (again) good, necessary,
and vital if "chaos" is to be avoided[. "[Weapon States" that "brandish"
their weapons must be policed]{.mark} to alleviate the threat they pose,
and the rise of "intolerant aggressive nationalisms in a disintegrating
communist bloc" can be read as moments of fantasy blockages in which the
Other is doing something "we" should be doing. One gets the sense that
as the lone superpower, America alone should have the right to
"brandish" its weapons of mass destruction---for example, in
"unabashedly laying down the rules of world order."]{.underline} One
also gets the sense that the potential rise of "aggressive intolerant
nationalisms" poses a blockage to the desiring American subject because
America itself should have the sole right to engage in the behaviors
engendered by such forces. Krauthammer's entire discourse is constructed
around the idea that America should aggressively promote its own ideas
for how the world should be organized and policed and that no other
entity has the ability or license to do so. America alone should
dominate the world, and for Krauthammer, America should be intolerant of
anyone else attempting to preempt this new opportunity, for this is the
road to "chaos." America possesses the "strength and will" that the rest
of the world does not, and thus America rightfully should exercise those
qualities to the benefit of all. Others' "aggressive intolerant
nationalisms" are threatening and not to be tolerated, but American
aggressive and nationalistic expansion are to be welcomed. [[American
nationalist-driven internationalism]{.underline}]{.mark} is beneficial
for the world, while other nationalisms are threatening. This
[[illustrates the notion that constructions of Self and Other are
underpinned by desire and]{.mark} enjoyment---or, rather, [the perceived
theft of enjoyment by others.]{.mark} "What we gain," Žižek (1993: 206)
contends, "by trans- posing the perception of inherent social
antagonisms into the fascination with the Other . . . is the
fantasy-organization of desire." Through Krauthammer's production of
threats, one sees the fascination exhibited by what others are doing,
the enjoyment that they are displaying, and how "they" are in a sense
stealing the enjoyment that "we" should be having and are lacking. [The
"fullness" that they seem to attain in their enjoyment is]{.mark}
perceived as precisely [the Thing that "we" seem to be missing]{.mark}.
"America" is lacking in some sense, and the Thing it lacks is [the very
Thing that "Weapon States" brandish]{.mark} openly.]{.underline}
Moreover, there is the worry that isolationism keeps "America" from
being fully itself. Indeed, if this revival spreads, an American
"collapse to second-rank status will not be for foreign but for domestic
reasons," such as the country's "insatiable desire for yet higher
standards of living without paying any of the cost" (Krauthammer
1990--91: 26--27). Krauthammer's fears of isolationism relate to the
"strength and will" of which he speaks in closing his essay. Yet the
manner in which isolationists, in Krauthammer's view, define the
national interest goes against America's true national interests, which
extend beyond the narrow confines of the nation's borders. America
should "unashamedly" lay down its own rules for global order, since the
world's interests coincide with American interests (33). Although
isolationism may indeed be an old theme of American foreign policy, it
is simply out of place in a unipolar world, which by definition must be
dominated by the unipolar power. "Isolationism" in this sense weakens
precisely the part of the American subject that must be utilized in
imposing and enforcing world order. Krauthammer's emphasis on the
necessity of "American strength and will" for world security points to
qualities that the subject "America" needs to have, in some sense has,
but in another sense does not have. In other words, "strength and will"
are a part of the subject that is missing but that is needed so that the
subject can fully become its own image of itself. These characteristics
are foremost uniquely American. The rest of the world cannot act without
America leading the way, since "where the United States does not tread,
the alliance will not follow" (24). [The rest of [the world lacks the
"strength and will" needed]{.mark} to define and carry out global order.
In a sense, [however, so does the United States]{.mark}. As the unipolar
power, America without a doubt has a great deal more "strength and will"
than any other power. Yet given a resurgent domestic "isolationism" and
other potential "domestic" problems, the United States does not yet have
the "strength and will" necessary to fully embrace its global role. The
subject is lacking some- thing that is posited as having faithfully
served it in the past but that it has lost exactly when it needs it the
most. What precisely Krauthammer means by "[strength and will" is left
undefined]{.mark}, yet their meaning could be filled in any number of
ways. [This lack of definition]{.mark}---indeed, the impossibility of
fully defining what they mean---[enables them to function as signifiers
covering the subject's lack in the fantasy. "Strength and will"
function]{.mark} as the Symbolic stand-ins [for what the subject
"America" currently lacks the full force]{.mark} of, yet in some sense
they remain a part of the subject]{.underline}. They may have been
temporarily or partly lost during the current isolationist revival, but
they are still a missing part of the subject that must be rediscovered
if "America" is going to more fully step into its proper role as global
leader. The partial enjoyment implied in both of these aspects---in the
just-out-of-reach image of an American dominated global system and the
"strength and will" that is both present in and absent from the
subject---sparks the desire for their pursuit. In the fantasy of the
"unipolar moment," the subject "America" seeks the perceived
to-be-missing parts of itself that it believes will bring it the
enjoyment it seeks, yet the fantasy posits obstacles to explain why
enjoyment is not forthcoming and why desire remains frustrated. Although
figures such as "Weapon States" are posited as blocking the culmination
and stabilization of the subject, these figures merely Symbolically
cover over the ambiguity, divisions, and frustrations that are inherent
to subject formation itself. Even though the signifier "isolationism" is
offered for why our "strength and will" have not been delivered, this of
course does not mean that "strength and will" would automatically be
forthcoming if "isolationism" were to subside. "[Strength and will" do
not represent anything but the lack of what the subject is constructed
as needing to pursue the image of fullness (an Americandominated world),
itself [an illusory object projected by the fantasy to pursue
enjoyment]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, the desires evoked by the
fantasy are very much in tension with the overall tenor of Krauthammer's
discourse. Again, as the subject "America" constructed as the sole
superpower, there is not much to desire in Krauthammer's text for
another object that might alleviate the ambiguities of subjectivity. As
the sole unipolar power, the collective subject is already close to
enjoyment in terms of a world shaped by American-imposed rules. However,
when the subject approaches the object it desires, desire itself starts
to fade. If one were to find the Thing that would truly make one whole,
desire would die, and subjectivity would evaporate. The desires evoked
by the fantasy ob- stacles posed and the evaporation of desire the
closer it approaches the enjoyment seemingly promised are in tension in
Krauthammer's discourse. In other words, there is not much distance
between the subject and the missing object, yet this distance is
necessary to maintain desire. [The subject in Krauthammer's discourse
(and implicitly projected to an audience) in fact helps to dissolve
desire rather than evoking the desire for identification. In closing in
on a truly American-centered world, [the desire for identification
with]{.mark} the subject of this discourse ("[America]{.mark}," the
"United States") [induces a kind of dissatisfaction]{.mark} because it
comes too close to the object(s) of desire. [Without desire, there is no
subject]{.mark}, and here the subject is close to fulfilling its desire.
In terms of its efficacy or resonance, then, it presumably it fails to
spark desires for identification. [If the United States]{.mark} now
[sits]{.mark} astride the globe [with relatively little to fear]{.mark}
from other great powers, [what is left to desire?]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Psycho 1NC -- Universality K vs K Affs

#### Centering [particular]{.underline} identity categories [strengthens]{.underline} capitalism and creates [barriers]{.underline} to collective emancipation by [occluding]{.underline} universality as a shared point of solidarity.

**McGowan, 20**---professor of film studies at the University of Vermont
(Todd, "Introduction: Finding Universality," *Universality and Identity
Politics*, Introduction, ebook, dml)

The clear argument of Capital and Marx's other major works is that
particularity or [the celebration of particular identity actually
**strengthens** capitalism and its control over one's
existence]{.underline}. [Freedom]{.underline}, if it is [seen and
pursued as a purely **particular** struggle]{.underline}, [**nourishes**
capitalism]{.underline}. [The **more** we imagine ourselves as identical
to our **particular identity**]{.underline}, [the more we see ourselves
as **isolated subjects**]{.underline}, [which is what capitalism
**requires**]{.underline}. [Capitalist subjects see themselves as
**isolated monads**]{.underline}, [and identification with one's
particularity **produces** this sense of isolation]{.underline}. [It is
**only** when freedom becomes a struggle for **universal freedom** that
it **challenges the capitalist behemoth**]{.underline}.

Far from seeing a danger in universality, Marx believes that [the **real
threat** comes from **accepting** the value of one's particular identity
within the capitalist socioeconomic system]{.underline}. [Capitalism
**thrives** on a **variety** of particular identities because this
variety provides for **more types of commodities** to be
sold]{.underline}. In our contemporary capitalist society, the goth can
buy trench coats and dark eyeliner while the jock can purchase
sweatpants and jerseys. More identities lead to more commodities. Even
if one's identity isn't tied to a particular look, [variety of identity
still plays into the capitalist system by providing **more opportunity**
for the production of needs]{.underline}. But more important, [seeing
oneself as particular puts one in the **capitalist
mindset**]{.underline}, [where there is **no universality** that might
change the entire structure]{.underline}. [By **believing** oneself to
be an isolated particular identity]{.underline}, [one takes up the role
of the **perfect capitalist subject**]{.underline}. [Capitalism
**depends** on all individuals believing themselves
**isolated**]{.underline} from everyone else.

Although capitalist society talks a great deal about freedom, this
freedom is actually a form of servitude for everyone, even those at the
top. From top to bottom, [everyone in capitalist society does what the
economy demands as long as they remain **trapped** within the bounds of
particular identity]{.underline}. Of course, [no one can **simply give
up** particular identity and exist as a **pure universal**]{.underline},
[but it is possible to become **alienated** from this
identity]{.underline}. [Doing so enables one to **abandon** one's
**libidinal investment** in particular identity]{.underline}, [an
abandonment that makes participation in universal struggle a **viable
option**]{.underline}. [But if particular individuals **fail** to grasp
their participation in the universal]{.underline}, [they will **continue
unknowingly** to play out their parts in the capitalist
economy]{.underline}.

According to Marx, [**emancipatory change** comes through the
recognition of]{.underline} the **[universality]{.underline}** of the
proletariat, whose revolution frees not just the working class but all
classes.14 [As long as I **fail** to see my universal connection with
others in capitalist society]{.underline}, [I remain the
**dupe**]{.underline} of that society. [Attempts to challenge capitalism
through insisting on identity can **do nothing to dent** capitalism's
dominance]{.underline}. [Particular identity is what **keeps one a
capitalist subject**]{.underline}.

[Just as Marx conceives particular identity as a **lure**]{.underline}
for oppressed subjects, [so do]{.underline} Simone **[de
Beauvoir]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} Frantz
**[Fanon]{.underline}**. With Beauvoir and Fanon, unlike with Marx,
although we remain within the Western philosophical tradition, we leave
the arena of European white guys. Their insistence on [universality as
the key to emancipation]{.underline}---a position they share with the
Western philosophical tradition---reveals that this [is **not** just the
claim of those tied to their social advantages]{.underline}.

Beauvoir insists on demolishing the image of female otherness that is,
for her, nothing but the badge of oppression. There is no question, for
Beauvoir, of celebrating feminine identity as a radical alternative to
patriarchy. Femininity holds no essential secret that might provide the
basis for emancipation. To the contrary, it is the idea of a feminine
identity that she finds oppressive. In The Second Sex, she claims, "If
man fails to discover that secret essence of femininity, it is simply
because it does not exist. Kept on the fringe of the world, woman cannot
be objectively defined through this world, and her mystery conceals
nothing but emptiness."15 Rather than asserting an essence of femininity
that society must value and protect, [Beauvoir's move]{.underline} here
[is]{.underline} the opposite: she wants [to **demolish** feminine
identity in order to assert women's participation in
universality]{.underline}. [Identity is an **obstacle** to overcome
rather than a **foundation** from which to base one's
politics]{.underline}. [Clinging to particular identity **cannot
possibly** be the source of emancipation since it **clearly functions**
as the driving force for]{.underline} female
**[subjugation]{.underline}**.

It is so difficult to abandon feminine identity, Beauvoir recognizes,
because its blandishments are almost the only symbolic support that
women receive in patriarchal society. As a woman, I receive recognition
for my embrace of a feminine identity and ostracism when I reject it. In
this way, it becomes clear why identity has an appeal. [If identity is
**oppressive**]{.underline}, [it nonetheless provides **recognition**
from a social authority]{.underline}. But [it is for this reason that
identity **cannot** be emancipatory]{.underline}. [Identity remains
within the domain of the social authority that **recognizes** it and is
thus **dependent through** and **through**]{.underline}. For Beauvoir,
valuing the particular identity of the feminine is not a way of fighting
sexism but the ultimate acquiescence to it. Beauvoir understands that
identity is an ideological trap that the feminist must avoid.16

By [giving up the feminine as an identity]{.underline}, the feminist
simultaneously [**undermines** the masculine]{.underline} as well.
[Masculine identity **depends** on its feminine counterpart that affirms
it as its complementary other]{.underline}. [Without this support,
masculine identity **collapses**]{.underline}. This is why the feminist
struggle against feminine identity that Beauvoir advocates is a battle
against patriarchy.

Though **[Fanon]{.underline}** advocates a more violent form of revolt
than Beauvoir, their [investment in]{.underline} the
[universality]{.underline} of the struggle [is the
**same**]{.underline}. [When the colonized **strike down** their
colonizing oppressors]{.underline}, [according to Fanon]{.underline},
[they do so **not** on behalf of their **particular local
identity**]{.underline} that Europe has destroyed [but in the name of a
**universality** that Europe has **abandoned** through its turn to
colonialism]{.underline}.17 [The violence of European colonialism does
**not** consist in imposing]{.underline} a **[foreign
universality]{.underline}** on the colonized people. [This is the
**fabrication** that the colonialists themselves **repeatedly
broadcast**]{.underline} with their claims of bringing culture to the
unenlightened. [The violence lies **instead** in the subjugation of the
colonized beneath the foot of the European **particular**]{.underline}.
[Colonialism does **not** involve European universality because
universality **cannot be parochial** in the way that the European
colonial project was]{.underline}.

[As Fanon sees it]{.underline}, [to **abandon** universality is to
**fall into the same trap** that ensnares Europe itself]{.underline}.
[The colonized **must not follow** Europe down the path of
**retreating** from universality into the promulgation of a **particular
identity**]{.underline}. [To **abandon** universality for particular
identity is to commit the **sin of Europe**]{.underline}, [though
**ironically**]{.underline} today [many **criticize** universality as a
**vestige of Eurocentrism**]{.underline}. [The fight against colonialism
is a fight to recognize the **universal equality** and **freedom** that
colonialism renders **invisible**]{.underline}. [It is **not** a fight
to preserve the **particularity** of local culture that European
colonialism wiped out]{.underline}.

[Localism]{.underline}, despite its obvious appeal, [is
**always**]{.underline} a **[reactionary]{.underline}** phenomenon.
[Even if it **drives out colonizers**]{.underline}, [it will replace
them with an **oppressive regime** that will not offer opportunity for
the distance from particularity that the universal
provides]{.underline}. It is [**only** the move to
**universality**]{.underline}, Fanon recognizes, that [opens up a
**genuine alternative** to colonialist oppression]{.underline}. Localism
is another form of what it struggles against.

Through Beauvoir and Fanon, the emancipatory project that begins with
modernity continues its universalist form. For them as for Kant and
Marx, [if emancipation **isn't universal** in scope]{.underline}, [it
**isn't really emancipation**]{.underline}. Emancipation has its basis
in universality and forges singularity through this universality. [There
can be **no equality** or **freedom** for certain identities while
others exist **outside** of equality and freedom]{.underline}. [Without
an appeal to **universals**]{.underline}, [we **lose touch** with the
emancipatory project **altogether**]{.underline}.

[Universality]{.underline}, in contrast to identity, **[cannot but be
emancipatory]{.underline}**. [Though there are]{.underline} innumerable
[cases when an oppressive external force imposes itself]{.underline} on
subjects in a holistic fashion, [this]{.underline} imposition **[does
not involve universality]{.underline}**. [No external force can
**impose** universality because no one **has** the universal to
impose]{.underline}. [It is **not possessable**]{.underline}. [The
universal is what the ruling order **doesn't** have]{.underline}, not
what it does have. In this way, [it is **always** on the side of those
fighting on behalf of **freedom** and **equality** because they are what
is **missing**]{.underline}, not what is manifested.

Due to its status as an absence that can never become fully present,
[the embrace of universality represents a **challenge** because it
entails an acceptance of our **necessary alienation**]{.underline}. The
[proponents of the universal cannot identify themselves **directly**
with the universal but can only **recognize the distance** that
separates them from it]{.underline}. [No subject can be a **universal**
subject, though the universal is the source of the subject's
**singularity**]{.underline}. We retreat from universality because it
deprives us of the consolations of identity. But it is only by giving up
the consolations of identity that we can discover our freedom.

PARTICULAR ENTITIES

Since the latter half of the twentieth century, [theorists of
emancipation have taken refuge in local particular identity as they
**seek an alternative** to]{.underline} the [totalizing
dangers]{.underline} of fascism, Stalinism, and global capitalism.
[Universality]{.underline}, [which was for earlier thinkers **integral**
to the emancipatory project]{.underline}, [becomes the **primary feature
of oppression**]{.underline}.18 [Rather than **freeing** subjects from
their ideological particularity]{.underline}, [universality comes itself
to be seen as an ideology that allows **no quarter** for difference or
otherness]{.underline}. **[Fascism]{.underline}**,
**[Stalinism]{.underline}**, [and **global capitalism** all appear to
operate through]{.underline} the imposition of their
**[universality]{.underline}** on oppressed particulars. [The insistence
on particular identity **appears** as the **only viable
response**]{.underline}.

Jacques Derrida's [**deconstruction** provides one]{.underline}
prominent [instance]{.underline} (among many) [of this turn to the
**particular** and **allergy** to the]{.underline} supposed violence of
the **[universal]{.underline}**. Through the practice of deconstruction,
Derrida undermines the pretensions to universality lurking in Western
metaphysics. The deconstruction of the metaphysical tradition is an
attempt to reveal the particular origins of its purported universality.
As Derrida sees it, deconstruction liberates us from the tyranny of the
universal by highlighting its failure to be really universal---its
reliance on the denial of its particularity.

Nowhere is [this]{.underline} strategy more evident than in the essay
"White Mythology: Metaphor in the Text of Philosophy," which [figures
the deconstruction of universality as a fight against its **inherent
racism**]{.underline}. [Here]{.underline}, Derrida uncovers the
mythological origin of the supposed universality of reason. He notes,
"Metaphysics---the white mythology which reassembles and reflects the
culture of the West; the white man takes his own mythology,
Indo-European mythology, his own logos, that is, the mythos of his
idiom, for the universal form of that he must still wish to call
Reason."19 Derrida is very clear here: [the universal is **nothing** but
the substitution of one's own **particular**]{.underline} mythology [for
a structure that applies to **all**]{.underline}. [Universality is the
**disguised violence** of an inflated particularity]{.underline}.
Combatting this violence, for Derrida, is not just a matter of directly
asserting particulars. It involves instead revealing how the universal
deconstructs itself, how its universality points toward a spectral
particularity that it never directly articulates.

[It is **difficult to overstate** the extent of the **reversal** that
takes place when universality comes to seem **oppressive** and
particularity comes to seem **liberatory**]{.underline}. Neither Kant,
Beauvoir, nor **[Fanon]{.underline}** would have believed that such a
reversal could even be possible. They [would be]{.underline}
collectively **[rubbing their eyes]{.underline}** today, [sure that
their vision had been **magically inverted**]{.underline}. [To claim
that our particular identity is the **site of liberation** is to **give
up** on the possibility that emancipation **might occur for
everyone**---and that it **must** occur for everyone if it is to **truly
be emancipation**]{.underline}. [Affirming particular identity as the
site for emancipation]{.underline} not only reverses the historical
alignment of emancipation with universality but [places an **unnecessary
barrier** in the way of **collective political action**]{.underline}.
[In a world that insists on particular identity as
emancipatory]{.underline}, [it is]{.underline} always [**difficult** to
get people to see the **commonality** of their struggles]{.underline}.

But [the **great setback** is that universality]{.underline}, [which is
**necessarily emancipatory**]{.underline}, [begins to **appear
oppressive**]{.underline}. [If freedom and equality cannot be
universal]{.underline}, [they **fall apart**]{.underline} as values.
When confined to a select group, they necessarily imply unfreedom and
inequality for those outside the group. There can be no freedom and
equality for some while others remain unfree and unequal. In this sense,
the turn from universality to identity betrays freedom and equality.
[Universality is an **integral part** of these values]{.underline}. For
this reason, [the political reversal that they have undergone is a
**catastrophe**]{.underline}. [The theoretical attempt to avoid
colluding with totalitarianism has created a situation in which we have
**lost the thread** of universal emancipation]{.underline}.

#### Vote neg to theorize universality as central to political struggle. That's the only way to [reckon with]{.underline} and [confront]{.underline} the [worst forms]{.underline} of capitalist violence.

**McGowan, 20**---professor of film studies at the University of Vermont
(Todd, "Conclusion: Avoiding The Worst," *Universality and Identity
Politics*, Conclusion, ebook, dml)

Universalist projects always threaten to become seduced by the
possibility of creating the universal into a full presence rather than
discovering it as a necessary absence. In doing so, they succumb to
terror. This is the perversion that universalism must constantly be on
guard against. Whenever people insist on their ability to create a world
of complete equality, we should recognize this perversion at work. [Even
if the **perversion** of universality is an **unavoidable danger**
inherent in universalizing]{.underline}, [it is **nonetheless worth the
risk**]{.underline}. [The alternative of total particularity is **more
murderous**]{.underline} and barbaric than the Committee for Public
Safety. This is why [the solution **cannot** be a retreat into the
confines of **particularity**]{.underline}.

Particularity does not exist without the absent universal that gives
this particularity its sense. The universal is antecedent to the
particular. [The attempt to retreat from the danger of the universal to
the security of a particular identity is **doomed** to
fail]{.underline}. What's more, [the repression of universality for the
sake of a full embrace of particularity leads to
**disaster**]{.underline}.

[Although it **doesn't appear as evident**]{.underline}, [the danger of
the extreme particularity that capitalism produces is **even more
ominous** than the **gulag**]{.underline}. [The dangers of particularity
have the advantage]{.underline}, however, [of being **much more
difficult to discern** than those of universality]{.underline}. [This is
why no one talks about the **number of people killed** under
capitalism]{.underline}. The [visibility]{.underline} of the gulag for
us today [**contrasts** with the invisibility of **exploited
laborers**]{.underline}, **[racist institutions]{.underline}**, [and
**underlying misogyny** that sustain the capitalist system]{.underline}.
[Although we don't **readily see** the horrors that capitalism's
**unbridled particularity** unleashes]{.underline}, [we **must
nonetheless pay attention** to them when **tallying up
corpses**]{.underline}.

[When we examine the horrors of capitalism's insistence on
particularity]{.underline}, [the **leger of destruction** ceases to seem
so **one-sided**]{.underline}. [The suffering perpetuated in the name of
universality actually **pales** in comparison with what occurred
**quietly** under the banner of particularism]{.underline}. [From
**children** working in **sweatshops** to **millions** living in
**favelas** to the reign of **military warlords**]{.underline},
[particularism **destroys lives**]{.underline} without even holding out
the promise of universal freedom and equality. It does so [in order that
a **few**]{.underline} individuals [can pursue]{.underline} the project
of [accumulation **without restraint**]{.underline}.

The destruction that [capitalist particularity has
perpetuated]{.underline} includes **[two world wars]{.underline}**, when
[the capitalist insistence on particularity led to **national
identitarian conflicts** that make the **Reign of Terror** look like a
time of **peace** and **prosperity**]{.underline}. [The violence of
particularism doesn't appear as part of an **explicit
project**]{.underline} in the way that universalism does, which is why
we don't chalk it up to particularism or identity as such. [The
**structure** of particular violence]{.underline}---a particular
identity commits it---[ends up **exculpating** particularism because we
blame the **individual** identity rather than the **political
philosophy** of particularism]{.underline} ([or the **capitalist
structure** that demands it]{.underline}). Our judgment on particular
identities like that of the Nazis rather than identity as such enables
identity to get off scot-free from the judgment of history. [When it
comes to universalism]{.underline}, [the situation is
**reversed**]{.underline}, [the blood that universalism sheds
**redounds** to the universal itself]{.underline}, [not to the
**individual actors** who order the violence]{.underline}.

When one attributes the violence of two world wars to the capitalist
insistence on particularity, this immediately raises questions. The
violence that particularism produces seems like natural violence rather
than the result of any political project.2 [No one entered into the wars
in the name of **particularity itself** but rather for the sake of
**national interest**]{.underline}. This is the case even for the
aggressors. [But when one enacts violence for the sake of an
**identity**]{.underline}, [one is not acting
**naturally**]{.underline}, [since there is **nothing natural** about
identity]{.underline}. [Every claim about the natural status of violence
**conceals** the **particularity**]{.underline} (and identitarian
philosophy) [performing the violence]{.underline}. Such [violence
**always** exists against the background of a]{.underline} particularist
system and a [**particularist** politics]{.underline}.

Blindness to the violence of particularism makes it easy to impugn
universality and to envision political struggle without it. But [without
the appeal to **universality**]{.underline}, [politics becomes
**nothing** other than a battle between **competing
interests**]{.underline}. [When this]{.underline} situation
[arises]{.underline}, [the **strongest** interest]{.underline}, the
interest of [**capital** itself]{.underline}, **[inevitably
wins]{.underline}**. [The retreat into identity neither **spares us**
from violence nor gives us a **more secure route** to
emancipation]{.underline}. [It does **nothing** but **create the
possibility for conservative rule**]{.underline}.

For too long, politics around the world has been staged on right-wing
terrain. [We envision a **particular world** with **particular
causes**]{.underline}. [This image of politics leads **inevitably** to
right-wing victories]{.underline}, even when moderates win elections.
One cannot count the election of Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, or Emmanuel
Macron as a triumph for emancipation but as part of the contemporary
conservative wave, despite the explicit political affiliation of these
figures. [In a world of competing particulars]{.underline}, [there is
**no possibility** for an emancipatory breakthrough]{.underline}.

But [this is **not** the only possible way of envisioning political
struggle]{.underline}. [If we view political contestation as a struggle
for the **form** that the universal will take]{.underline}, [we are on
the terrain of]{.underline} the Left and [the project of
**emancipation**]{.underline}. [We **don't** need to opt for the
universal in **one grand act** but must **begin** to **theorize
universality** as the **fundamental stake** in political
contestation]{.underline}. [The **great leap forward** consists in
**recognizing** politics as the struggle between **universality** and
**particularity**]{.underline}. [Once we take this leap]{.underline},
[we **force** the Right to play all their political games on the
road]{.underline}. Unlike in football games, [in a political struggle
**home field advantage always wins**]{.underline}, [and gaining this
advantage **depends** on recognizing the role of **universality** in
politics]{.underline}. [The fight for emancipation **must
be**]{.underline} a **[universal]{.underline}** fight, [or it **cannot
be won**]{.underline}.

#### Independently---only embracing universality can confront [existential impacts]{.underline}. 

**McGowan, 20**---professor of film studies at the University of Vermont
(Todd, "This Is Not Identity Politics," *Universality and Identity
Politics*, Chapter 6, ebook, dml)

There is one arena where the limitations of particularism become fatal.
[The **political implications** of the refusal of universality are
**catastrophic**]{.underline} when we look at climate change. Even [when
we think about **climate change**]{.underline} as a global phenomenon,
[our starting point is **too often**]{.underline} the various
disturbances that we link together to form the idea of climate change.
We encounter climate change in **[particular
manifestations]{.underline}** like shifting weather patterns, more
intense storms, higher water levels, increased temperatures, and so on.
The question then becomes whether or not the particulars constitute
climate change, which is precisely what opens the door to climate
skeptics. But [even if we all agree that these **particular**
indications amount to climate change]{.underline}, [particularist
thinking **shapes** how we respond]{.underline}.

[Although climate change **requires** a universalist
approach]{.underline}, [we confront it from the perspective of the
**particular**]{.underline}. [As a result]{.underline}, [**most**
political initiatives are particular]{.underline}: recycling, driving
less, biking more, not using the air conditioning, placing solar panels
on one's roof, planting trees, and so on ---up to taking a ship across
the ocean to reduce one's carbon footprint. [Even]{.underline} the
[**more holistic** solutions]{.underline} like the carbon tax or
restrictions on carbon output [do **not** confront the crisis through a
**universalist** politics]{.underline}. [We can **only** address the
problem of climate change **effectively** when we address it in
**universal** rather than **particular** terms]{.underline}.

[The problem is **not** just that our **solutions** are particularist
but that we **perceive** the crisis through a **particularist way of
knowing**]{.underline}. Epistemology rooted in the particular makes
itself felt most prominently in the assumption of an existential
scarcity of resources. Those who believe that humancreated climate
change is occurring also presuppose this existential scarcity because
they take the particular individual as the starting point. For the
particular individual, there are a limited number of resources available
that the society must distribute in some way. The economic division of
resources takes place against the background of a fundamental scarcity.
But [as the capitalist system hurtles us closer and closer to a **global
catastrophe**]{.underline}, [it is important to **avoid** thinking in
particular terms]{.underline}. One cannot fight climate change by not
having children, eating vegan, eliminating air travel, or any of the
other particular remedies that the advocates of scarcity preach. [The
**only way** to join the fight is to **embrace
universalism**]{.underline}. [Our universalism must become
**unrelenting**]{.underline}, [or we will **destroy ourselves** through
our **particularism**]{.underline}.

[The climate crisis presents us with a **unique opportunity** for
recognizing universality]{.underline}. [The climate crisis is universal
**not** because it **affects everyone** but because it is the **point of
absence** within every social order]{.underline}. [What every society
**shares**]{.underline} today [is the environmental catastrophe that it
**cannot master**]{.underline}. [This hole within every society doesn't
affect every society in the **same way**]{.underline}, [but it
marks]{.underline} the limit [that **no society can
eliminate**]{.underline}.

[By **foregrounding the fundamental absence** within every social
order]{.underline}, [the climate crisis puts us **directly in touch**
with the universal]{.underline}. [We become **aware** of the **lack**
that we have in common]{.underline}. Here, Hollywood cinema, which so
often leads us astray, offers an instructive example. The disaster film
provides an occasion for Hollywood to turn massive destruction into a
spectacle for entertainment. In this sense, we should be suspicious of
it, since this is the formula that Walter Benjamin uses to define the
aesthetics of fascism. But in addition to the spectacle of destruction,
the disaster film, at its best, shows us what few other mainstream films
do: [the **reintroduction of absence** into the social
field]{.underline}, [alongside a connection to
**universality**]{.underline}. Within the disaster film, the disaster
does not simply pose a threat to the lives of characters. Much more
important, it confronts them with the fact of a structuring absence. The
disaster **[disrupts]{.underline}** the **[daily lives]{.underline}** of
the characters, makes privacy unsustainable, [and **brings everyone in
touch** with universality]{.underline}.

In order to register this disruption, every disaster film begins with a
variety of characters engaged in their quotidian behavior. Private
concerns predominate the openings of these films. We see, for instance,
a display of marital troubles in Mark Robson's Earthquake (1974), the
interaction of a town mayor and her children in Roger Donaldson's
Dante's Peak (1997), or a class field trip in Roland Emmerich's The Day
After Tomorrow (2004). In each case, the focus on private activity
serves only as a prelude to its coming insignificance. In the face of
the disaster, subjects must turn their concern away from their own
particularity and toward the universal.

In the typical disaster film, [the disaster makes everyone aware of a
**fundamental lack** that harbors the universal]{.underline}. When the
disaster strikes, characters immediately begin to concern themselves
with others. The [reintroduction of the **structuring absence** through
the disaster is simultaneously the reintroduction of
**universality**]{.underline}. [Everyone confronts their equality with
everyone else]{.underline}. The disaster film transforms a
particularized world containing only isolated monads into a lacking
world of the universal.

Perhaps the outstanding example of this trajectory toward universality
in absence occurs in Mick Jackson's Volcano (1997). As a volcano
unexpectedly erupts in the middle of Los Angeles, we see characters
abandon their private isolation and come together to struggle against
the destructiveness of the volcano and the lava flowing through the city
streets. But what is most significant about the film is the relationship
that it depicts between universality and capitalist particularity. In
order to stop the lava flow from destroying a heavily populated portion
of the city, the chief of emergency management Mike Roark (Tommy Lee
Jones) plans to dynamite a newly constructed skyscraper to form a dam
that would direct the lava to the ocean. The skyscraper is the pride of
capitalist Norman Calder (John Corbett), who champions particular
concerns over the universal in the film.

The dynamiting of Calder's building represents the destruction of
particularity that rejects any universality. The film underlines this
idea through its earlier presentation of Calder. As the threat
increases, he attempts to persuade his wife, Dr. Jaye Calder (Jacqueline
Kim), to stop treating the victims of the volcano and leave the
hospital. Norman wants Jaye to forsake any universality for her
particular existence. At one point, he comes to the hospital to beg her
to escape the danger. He says to her, "These people are strangers, Jaye.
Are you doing to die for them?... Answer me!" In response, Jaye simply
continues treating the patients and, without ever looking at him, says,
"I am answering you." Jaye answers Norman's rebarbative particularity
with an unwavering universalism. The fact that she articulates her
commitment to universality through the act of not speaking befits this
commitment perfectly. Through the depiction of this exchange, the film
shows that it understands that a point of absence in the structure of
signification constitutes genuine universalism. The disaster awakens her
solidarity with others while her husband remains unaffected by it.
Through this exchange, the film presents the fundamental choice that the
disaster makes evident. We can choose to isolate ourselves in our
particularity or avow the universal.

Just as in the disaster film, [the **catastrophe of climate change**
makes universal equality **apparent**]{.underline}. [In the face of the
incipient disaster]{.underline}, [all are **equal**]{.underline}, [even
though climate change **affects people differently**]{.underline}. **[No
one can escape]{.underline}**, [not even the **wealthy**]{.underline}
individuals now buying up land in areas that they believe will be least
affected by the disaster. [If they survive]{.underline} in some future
isolation, [they will survive as **empty beings**]{.underline}, beings
[without any universality to set them free]{.underline}. [The absence of
any viable escape for particular individuals is the form that
**equality** assumes]{.underline} today. This is why [any project of
confronting the disaster **must**]{.underline} at the same time
[**confront** the growing economic inequality in the]{.underline}
contemporary [capitalist universe]{.underline}.

[Capitalism's inherent refusal of universality leaves it]{.underline}
[**completely ill-equipped** to deal with the climate
crisis]{.underline}. [Its solutions will always be
**particular**]{.underline}---carbon tax, recycling, bike riding, and so
on---[when the **universal** is requisite]{.underline}. [When
large-scale responses emerge within capitalism]{.underline}, [they will
be profitable for **some** at the expense of **others**]{.underline}.
[We should **reject them** in the name of **universality**]{.underline}.
[The particularist nature of capitalism will attempt to **pit people
against each other** in the name of saving the planet]{.underline}.

When walking through the streets of Berlin in fall 2019, I glanced up at
a placard that ominously portended the capitalist future and made me
wish that I was unable to read German. The sign (with a very
environmental look to it) read: "Berlin Lässt die Unwelt im Regeln
Stehen; Mietendeckel bedeutet: Wir können nicht mehr in den Klimaschutz
investieren" ("Berlin Let the Environmental Regulations Stand; Rent Caps
mean: We can no longer invest in climate action"). Here we have the
perfect particularist (and capitalist) twist to the climate crisis.
Rather than see the climate crisis as the occasion for articulating
universal equality, the placard enjoins Berliners to see a direct
opposition between concern for equality and action on the climate.
Attempts such as this pose climate action against egalitarian concerns.
On the one hand, the placard accepts that the climate crisis is
universal, but it uses this universality as a reason for jettisoning the
egalitarian project of rent caps. This has the effect of particularizing
the climate struggle. [The inherent universality of the climate crisis
**transforms** into a particular struggle when the **exigencies of
capitalism** enter into the equation]{.underline}. [But
capitalism]{.underline}, [due to its complete investment in
particularism]{.underline}, [is **unequipped** to address a crisis that
**demands universality**]{.underline}. Thus, [the fight against climate
change **must** be a universalist fight against capitalism]{.underline}
as well.

[Particular identity is **always a trap**]{.underline}, [but when the
question **so clearly** involves the **whole planet**]{.underline},
[particularism becomes **even more dangerous**]{.underline}. [It causes
us to **miss** both **pitfalls** and **solutions** that universality
renders **visible**]{.underline}. [To **retreat** into our own
particular identity is to participate in the **ultimate destruction of
human existence** itself]{.underline}. [More than ever before in human
history]{.underline}, [the urgency of the climate crisis demands an
**explicitly universalist politics**---and a **universalist
epistemology**---in response]{.underline}.

When we sit around wondering why climate skeptics reject the obvious
fact of climate change, we need look no further than the universality
that environmental destruction makes evident. [Identitarians see in
climate change a **clear argument** for the universality that they
oppose]{.underline}. [Accepting its existence entails **admitting** the
universality that their political position **denies**]{.underline}.
[Universality]{.underline} is inherently dialectical. It [lets us
**see** what particular identity
**hides**]{.underline}---[**connection** in the midst of
**division**]{.underline}.

[Universality allows for a **response** to a catastrophe like climate
change that is **equal** to the **magnitude** of the event]{.underline}.
[Our particular identity]{.underline}, in contrast, [leaves us with
**only** a series of responses that **can never add up** to being
**adequate** to the problem]{.underline}. [The stake of the struggle
between particular identity and universality is now **existence
itself**]{.underline}.

#### Centering the universal [psychoanalytically generates]{.underline} emancipatory politics.

**McGowan, 20**---professor of film studies at the University of Vermont
(Todd, "The Importance of Being Absent," *Universality and Identity
Politics*, Chapter 2, ebook, dml)

[This shared way of relating to the universal can be]{.underline} seen
as [the **basis of freedom**]{.underline}. Although societies may
suppress the awareness of freedom, [freedom is **universal** across
every type of social order]{.underline}. [The basis for this universal
freedom is the inability of **any form** of mastery]{.underline}, **[no
matter how despotic]{.underline}**, [to be **complete**]{.underline}.
[No society can determine its subjects with **complete success** but has
a point of **nonbelonging** on which mastery ultimately
**founders**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} point of nonbelonging
[**universally** marks every]{.underline} form of society and every type
of [culture from within]{.underline}. Despite efforts to minimize its
effects, [it acts as a **constant disturbance** of every society's daily
functioning]{.underline}. As the point of nonbelonging, [the universal
is the reverse side of total despotism]{.underline}. [Universality
exists in despotism's **lack**]{.underline}.1

Even if a structure of [mastery]{.underline} assimilates one point of
nonbelonging, it [**cannot assimilate** nonbelonging]{.underline} as
such. [Mastery strives toward becoming **total**]{.underline}, [but as
it comes closer to eliminating all resistance]{.underline}, it runs into
an insuperable barrier---[its own **dependence** on what it cannot
assimilate]{.underline}---that [acts as a **brake** on its total
control]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} barrier [**energizes** the
compulsion to mastery by giving it something to act on and thus a
**reason for being**]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} despite the power
exercised on it, [the barrier proves **unyielding**]{.underline} because
it represents the necessary condition for the existence of any mastery
at all. As a result, [despotic power **can't achieve** total
despotism]{.underline}. Its external barrier is really an internal
limit. If the external barrier ceases to be intractable, another one
will emerge. When it comes to despotism, the elimination of one barrier
is always the prelude to a new one that will seem just as intractable as
the former one did.

We can see this even in the case of the actions of the relatively
nondespotic global capitalist order after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
This event signaled the end of what was an intractable barrier for the
capitalist order: the Iron Curtain. For a brief interlude in the early
1990s, it seemed as if this order would eliminate nonbelonging
altogether. But the interlude did not last long. New manifestations of
nonbelonging quickly arose, most significantly in various forms of
reactionary Islamicist projects, including Al Qaida's destructive
assault on the United States and the attempt by the Islamic State and
the Levant (ISIL) to establish a caliphate in the Middle East. This
Islamicist terror appeared in the guise of a new intractable barrier,
which is why George W. Bush imagined the war against it as an almost
unending one. By proclaiming a War on Terror with no definite end point,
Bush announced the replacement for the Iron Curtain.

The emergence of this new external barrier to capitalism's complete
globalization testifies to the internal limit of capitalism's
totalization, a limit not just for capitalism but one that renders every
attempt at total mastery futile. Even if the form of the barrier is
contingent--- for the capitalist order, it might have been
fundamentalist Christians rather than Islamicists---the limit itself is
necessary. The limit that every structure ultimately runs into is an
unassimilable nonbelonging that acts as a constitutive absence for the
structure. Nonbelonging is universal.

[No society can include]{.underline} us [without simultaneously
**alienating**]{.underline} us from it. My [belonging]{.underline} in a
society [always **breaks down**]{.underline}, which enables me [to turn
against]{.underline} this [society]{.underline} when it takes a
direction that I cannot accept. This is why I am free. [Freedom is not a
value of belonging]{.underline}, of being a member of a free society.
[Freedom becomes apparent as a value when we experience our
**nonbelonging**]{.underline}, [a nonbelonging that is **universal**
because it applies to everyone]{.underline}, even those who most feel
like they fit in.

[We **universally fail** to fit in]{.underline}, [and this universal
failure is the **basis** of our freedom from social
determination]{.underline}. [Even the **most authoritarian** society
cannot eviscerate the freedom that exists as a result of its
**inability** to integrate individuals into its order with complete
success]{.underline}. [No matter **how strongly** social forces act on
us]{.underline}, [we **cannot simply obey** without an unconscious
supplement to this obedience that **undermines** it in some
way]{.underline}, which is why the Stalinist Soviet Union required
special sites for those who didn't go along. The gulag exists because
universal freedom pervades mass indoctrination as a structuring absence.
This absence owes its existence to the unconscious that throws the
individual out of joint with itself. If there were no unconscious, there
would be no freedom, even though we assume that the unconscious, because
it involves what we don't consciously will, is the site of our
unfreedom.

[Nonbelonging manifests itself in each subject as the
**unconscious**]{.underline}. [To have an unconscious means that I
**can't belong to myself**]{.underline}, [that I can never be
**completely identical** with what I am]{.underline}. [The **gap** that
prevents the social order from completing itself **intrudes** in me by
installing a gap between what I **will** and how I
**desire**]{.underline}, a gap that psychoanalysis calls [the
**unconscious**]{.underline}. As speaking beings with an unconscious,
our [unconscious desire is at odds with our conscious will]{.underline}.
I will to limit my caloric intake every day in order to keep fit, but my
unconscious desire leads me to eat a Twinkie after dinner and sabotage
my diet. Unfortunately, my will to diet is not an act of freedom, but
the sabotage is.

[Freedom emerges out of an unconscious desire that doesn't jibe with
social demands]{.underline}, not in our free will. [Acts of freedom do
not occur when I **consciously weigh the options** and make a decision
to revolt but when I feel that I **cannot do otherwise** and act in
accordance with my **unconscious drive**]{.underline}. This is the
paradox of freedom and the result of its origin in what we lack rather
than what we have (our conscious will).

The universality of this internal distance in all subjects marks their
freedom from total coercion. [If the demands of the social order and the
responses of the individual subject lined up perfectly]{.underline},
[there would be **no space** for universal freedom]{.underline}. [We
would be locked into our **particular identity** and locked into our
**given world**]{.underline}. [But we constantly see their **failure**
to line up with each other]{.underline}. [Even when I try to act in
**total conformity**]{.underline} with social injunctions, [a **gap**
remains between the command and my obedience]{.underline} to it. [This
gap is necessary for both **obedience** and **revolt**]{.underline}. It
enables me to invest in obedience through an act of identification
rather than just following it by rote. But on the other hand, the gap
between the social demand and my obedience makes total obedience
impossible. Total obedience necessarily hides some degree of rebellion,
which is why the appearance of complete obedience always renders
authorities suspicious.

The employee who always eagerly follows the boss's orders may come home
at night and dream about killing the boss. The conscious effort to be
the perfect employee cannot exist without some unconscious investment in
subversion, even if it isn't as dramatic as a fantasy of murder. It
could be as simple as the enjoyment of showing up colleagues who fail to
follow orders as promptly or as efficiently. In this way, the conforming
employee would contribute to the disorder of the company rather than its
efficiency. All communities suffer from the same problem of
nonbelonging, not just corporations (which actually have incentives in
place to produce belonging, like employment itself and salaries, that
other communities don't have). [Nonbelonging **brings freedom** because
it indicates that we have no substantial support in the social order to
rely on]{.underline}.2

It is [our inability to fully belong]{.underline} that also [provides
the basis for the **universality of equality**]{.underline}. [No one can
**fully belong** to a social order that is itself **incomplete** and
thus cannot precisely differentiate between belonging and
nonbelonging]{.underline}. There is no secure inside that can serve to
define belonging.3 [All fail to belong **equally**]{.underline}, [even
though some **cling** to the **illusion** of their belonging **more**
than others]{.underline}.

[Social hierarchies **mask** this failure and present some people as
**more equal** than others]{.underline}. [But this value depends
**entirely** on the assessment of **others**]{.underline}. [It is **not
self-sustained** by any social authority]{.underline}. [If no one truly
belongs]{.underline}, [then no hierarchy has **any substantial
status**]{.underline}. [All social hierarchies **depend** on our
**collective belief** in them]{.underline}. [Simply by **collectively
disbelieving** in someone's importance]{.underline}, [we can cause this
importance to **vanish**]{.underline}, [which reveals the **universal
equality** that becomes evident through the lack of
belonging]{.underline}.

### Psycho 2NC -- FW vs K Affs

#### The most important political question is [form]{.underline}---universality or particularity comes prior to the aff.

**McGowan, 20**---professor of film studies at the University of Vermont
(Todd, "Our Particular Age," *Universality and Identity Politics*,
Chapter 1, ebook)

[How one conceives a struggle is always more significant than which side
one takes in the struggle]{.underline}---[because it determines which
side will be more psychically appealing]{.underline}. [We should not
**measure political victory by**]{.underline} who wins elections or by
[whose issues triumph but by **how we envision the political struggle**
itself]{.underline}. [The decisive **political question** **involves
not** the **conclusions** that we come to **but** the **form that
politics takes**.]{.underline} [This is evident]{.underline} on a very
elementary level [in the thinking of **Karl Marx**]{.underline}: [he
sees that if we view **global politics** as the **confrontation**
between **sovereign nations**, it is **impossible** to **recognize** the
**class antagonism** that knows no national borders. We'll always be
thinking about international conflicts and will never be able even to
raise the question of class exploitation that transcends national
barriers.]{.underline} [Historically, Marxists have spent so much time
fighting against nationalism because they recognize that **investment**
in the **idea of the nation** produces a fundamental **barrier to**
seeing the **possibility of class struggle**]{.underline}.1

[This is why]{.underline} one of the first things that [Lenin wanted
to]{.underline} do when he created a communist government in Russia was
to [put an end to Russia's participation in World War I. Following Marx,
he saw that the question of an international conflict would render the
class struggle invisible. This lesson from Marxism shows that our
**conception** of what constitutes the **form of political conflict**
**shapes** the **possibilities** that will be able to emerge in the
actual **political struggle.**]{.underline}

Others have emphasized the importance of form in politics. For instance,
[linguist and political theorist **George Lakoff** provides an
instructive effort to establish the **significance of form** in
**political campaigning**.]{.underline} Frustrated with the consistent
failures of the moderate Left in the United States, Lakoff offers some
advice. [He argues that leftists tend to forget that what counts is how
we **frame political issues**, even **more than** the **positions** that
**we take** on them]{.underline}. Framing---or form---can render battles
more winnable before we fight them. According to Lakoff, [the real
political struggle takes place on a symbolic level]{.underline}. It
concerns the terms that we use to describe the contest between each
camp. In the afterword to his book on this subject, Moral Politics,
Lakoff makes his clearest statement on this issue. [He states, "The
**facts** themselves **won't set you free**. You have to **frame facts**
properly before they can have the meaning you want them to
convey]{.underline}."2 Lakoff has a particular prescription for the
moderate Left that reveals how he thinks about form[. He envisions
changing the moral frame that surrounds contemporary issues from one
conducive to conservatives (the Strict Father) to one favorable for
liberalism (the Nurturing Parent).]{.underline} [For
Lakoff,]{.underline} [winning the symbolic frame game will enable
liberal politicians to triumph in elections.]{.underline}

[Lakoff grasps that form matters more than content]{.underline}, which
is surely right as far as it goes. [But it **doesn't go far enough**.
Despite his efforts at reframing in a leftist direction, Lakoff remains
on a basically conservative terrain because his vision of form is not
wide-ranging enough. The problem is that he **continues** to see the
struggle in terms of **two competing particular camps** but imagines the
camps differently than we currently do]{.underline}. [He simply wants to
**replace the particularity** of the Strict Father with that of the
Nurturing Parent. The battle between these two forms is a battle of
opposed particulars,]{.underline} arranged so that a different
particular might be able to win[. Lakoff has **no place for
universality**. His formalist vision is not formalist enough because it
never attains universality]{.underline}. The image he lights on ---that
of the Strict Father versus Nurturing Parent---is already an admission
of defeat before the battle.3

[By conceiving of the struggle in a way that **leaves universality out
of the picture**, one **accepts** the basic **conservative** premise of
politics that says that the **starting point** for politics is the
isolated **individual**.]{.underline} [According to this position,
individuals **exist** in a meaningful way **outside the universality**
that **constitutes them as individuals in the first place.** Once one
accepts this premise, the **struggle is already over** because
universality will always appear as an impingement on the privilege of
the individual]{.underline}. [No argument about universality will ever
ultimately prove convincing for those who see the isolated individual as
the political starting point. The conservative victory occurs with the
dominance of the image of two]{.underline} (or more) [particular forces
fighting it out for political supremacy.]{.underline}

[What this image gets **wrong** is that **political struggle** takes
place **between universality and particularity** **rather than between
competing particulars**]{.underline}, despite the fact that we don't
recognize it as such. [The struggle between competing particulars or
opposed tribes is always a play of shadows that obscures the
**fundamental opposition** between **universality and
particularity**.]{.underline} [**Universality** concerns and **sustains
all particulars**, but particularity \[often does not understand\] ~~is
often blind to~~ the necessity of its connection to others that
universality constantly foregrounds.]{.underline} Although universal and
particular exist in a dialectical relation---[there is no universality
without particularity and vice versa---it matters which position one
chooses as a starting point.]{.underline}

[This opposition between particular and universal as the **starting
point** is what constitutes the **distinction** between **conservative**
politics of all stripes and **emancipatory** politics,]{.underline} even
though this is not how the distinction is commonly understood. My
contention is that [the most appropriate way to **understand** the terms
**Right and Left** is by **associating** them **with particularity and
universality**, respectively. If one doesn't take this step and
**instead sees** the opposition as one involving **competing tribes**,
then one implicitly **gives the Right the upper hand.**]{.underline}

### Psycho 2NC -- Universality Good vs K affs

#### Universality is the essential historical basis for revolutionary struggle.

**McGowan, 20**---professor of film studies at the University of Vermont
(Todd, "Introduction: Finding Universality," *Universality and Identity
Politics*, Introduction, ebook)

Despite the obviousness of inequality in contemporary society, universal
equality has ceased to be a thriving political project. This is perhaps
the strangest feature of the current order. [Rather than fight the
massive inequality with a project of universal equality, we engage in
struggles for **justice for a series of groups**---without ever defining
justice, without ever naming the equality that would constitute justice.
The absence of universalist claims today stands out and separates our
epoch politically from prior ones. But the turn away from universality
is not just one political development among many. To **betray
universality** is to **give up on the project of emancipation**
altogether]{.underline}.

This is what all the great political revolutionaries of the past have
recognized. [From the **Jacobins** in France to the **suffragettes** in
the United States to the African National Congress in South Africa, the
most significant political actors have seen **universality as the
absolute key** to their struggle. This is why abolitionist hero
Frederick Douglass participated in the epochal Seneca Falls Convention
for women's suffrage and why feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton joined the
Anti-Slavery Convention.]{.underline} They were not practicing coalition
building. [Both understood that one could not separate the emancipation
of some from the **universal project of emancipation**.]{.underline}

[The necessary universality of emancipation is what diminishes the
grandeur of the American Revolution in the popular imagination relative
to its French counterpart.]{.underline}1 Whenever anyone refers to the
revolutionary spirit of the late eighteenth century, it is almost always
the French Revolution, not the American, that serves as the touchstone.
It's not just that the American Revolution, despite coming first, didn't
generate a catchy slogan like liberté, égalité, and fraternité, nor have
as many exciting beheadings.2 [The problem is that the **American
Revolution** betrayed the universality of emancipation by **excluding
slaves** from its emancipatory project.]{.underline}

In 1794, [when the **Jacobins** were in power in France, they made it a
point to **free the slaves of Saint Domingue** (Haiti). In contrast,
those who wrote the **American Constitution** took pains to **avoid
mentioning slavery** or freedom for slaves in order to gain approval
from the slaveowners who helped to craft it.]{.underline} Instead of
addressing the issue head on, [the document makes oblique reference to
slaves by counting them as three-fifths of a person]{.underline} for the
purposes of representation, according to Article I, Section 2.
Subsequently, in Article I, Section 9, [the Constitution prohibits
Congress from banning the slave trade until 1808, while still managing
to avoid the mention of slaves or slavery. The final allusion to slavery
occurs in the fugitive slave clause, from Article IV, Section 2, which
prohibits slaves from fleeing to states without slavery in order to gain
their freedom.]{.underline} But again, the authors of the Constitution
managed to construct a fugitive slave law while circumventing the use of
the term slave. As this quick survey reveals, slavery functions as the
repressed content of the American Constitution.3 It haunts the document
but never explicitly appears. As this repressed content, [slavery
reveals the **ultimate failure of American universality**.]{.underline}
Despite the universal claims of the Declaration of Independence ---"We
hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal"---[the Constitution exposes the American Revolution's utter
betrayal of universal equality.]{.underline}

The American experience shows how costly the violation of universality
is. [By giving up on universal equality, the U.S. Constitution
inaugurates centuries of inequality for all Americans.]{.underline}
Black Americans clearly suffer from this inequality as both slaves and
then as second-class citizens, but white Americans lose their own
equality as well. One cannot exist as an equal in a society that
institutionalizes inequality, especially if one is among the privileged
class.

[Through the 1960s, attempts to fight this inequality focused clearly on
universal struggle. But eventually political struggle in the United
States and around the world became more diffuse, and universal
emancipation slipped into the background.]{.underline} Universality
began to seem itself the badge of oppression, as if invoking the
universal put one on the side of mastery and violence. While a universal
struggle nonetheless continued, it could not explicitly invoke the
moniker of universal emancipation without becoming politically suspect.
The loss of the moniker was not simply an insubstantial adjustment in
the history of emancipation. [The **abandonment** of the idea of
**universal emancipation** has had **catastrophic
effects.**]{.underline}

But this abandonment did not occur in a vacuum. [Perhaps the main reason
why the project of universal emancipation became suspect is its horrific
failure in the twentieth century.]{.underline} The story of the
twentieth century is the story of the egalitarian revolution gone awry.
[The victory of the Bolsheviks in Russia in 1917, Mao's conquest of
China in 1949, the takeover of Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge in
1975]{.underline}---all these events (and numerous others) seem to
reveal that egalitarian projects are not exactly a good idea. If these
movements show us what universal emancipation looks like, we should
probably think twice about advocating it. They lead to the Soviet gulag,
the Maoist Cultural Revolution, or Pol Pot's killing fields. The
communist path to universal equality produced equality only in the very
worst sense: all were equal in death.

[But these **failed projects** of universal emancipation **did not fail
because of their universality**. They failed because of their
fundamental **misconception** about what universality was.]{.underline}
In the twentieth century, universal emancipation turned into butchery at
the moment when the political projects betrayed the universality that
animated them. [Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot all believed in the possibility
of **total belonging**. To that end, they tried to create societies in
which everyone could belong, failing to grasp that universality exists
because everyone cannot belong--- through the failure of a social order
to become all-inclusive. We **cannot invent universality** as fully
realized and present but must discover it in the internal limit that
every society confronts. But these murderous projects viewed equality as
a value to invent rather as a **value to discover**. This is the formula
for the **gulag.**]{.underline}

[The invention of equality required a violent **uprooting of the past**,
which is why it led so easily to **mass murder**. This is the core
problem of the **communist** experiment.]{.underline} Typified by
Stalin, these regimes sought to break entirely with the past and to
create a new person, one without any of the prejudices of tradition.4
But [they missed the key fact that we do not need to invent equality out
of whole cloth. We need only look for it in a disguised form in the gap
that separates us from each other. Equality **does not require
liquidation of the old or creation of the new**.]{.underline}

Redeeming the project of universal emancipation requires looking anew at
what universality means. It requires a turn from invention to discovery.
[When we discover universality, we see it in what already animates our
relations]{.underline}, [even---or especially---when we **seem at odds**
with each other. The discovery of universality reshapes how we relate to
each other and gives our politics a form that it otherwise wouldn't
have. Turning to a viable conception of universality is politically
requisite. Without universality, we have no way to orient our political
struggle toward a widespread appeal.]{.underline}

[The fear of universality on both the Left and the Right has created a
vacuum today.]{.underline} The Right rightfully fears universality
because it sees in universality the end of the privileges of wealth and
status that it wants to sustain. The Left's fear stems from a genuine
desire not to repeat the experience of the gulag and the killing fields.
[But the abandonment of universality cuts the heart out of the
Left.]{.underline}

[Emancipation is **always universal** if it is **genuine emancipation**.
Struggling for freedom, equality, and solidarity for some and not others
is not struggling for freedom, equality, and solidarity. If one's
struggle is not universal, if it does not have implications for
everyone, there is **no reason at all for others to join** one in it.
Nonuniversal struggle is a zero-sum game that leaves each group (and
ultimately each individual) on its own and **incentivizes** other groups
to **work against** the particular group's struggle. What's more, with
the contemporary turn away from universal emancipation, we destroy the
promise of modernity itself.]{.underline} We turn away from the
important lessons of many of the key figures of modern Western
philosophy.

EMANCIPATION THROUGH INTERRUPTION

The basic idea of the modern Western philosophical tradition is that
universality is emancipatory. It has become commonplace, with good
reason, to critique this tradition for the racial and gender prejudices
that it harbors. To some extent, the major thinkers of the West were
trapped within an oppressive ideology that they could not think their
way out of. According to this critique, theorists such as Kant, Hegel,
and even Marx held onto racial and gender prejudices that they weren't
able to transcend.5 But at the same time, what this critique misses is
that they had an insight into the possibility for universal emancipation
that we are now in danger of losing. Their prejudices represent their
own failure to accede personally to the grandeur of the universalist
principles they held. They are particular failings. One can upbraid them
for their prejudices only from the perspective of the universalist
project that they articulate and that remains viable today.

Emancipation occurs through universality and its ability to lift us out
of our immediate situation. Our immediate situation is always unfree
because it is given to us, either by the natural world or by the society
into which we are born.6 There can be no immediate freedom. Freedom
emerges when one begins to depart from the givens of one's existence,
not by hunkering down and attaching oneself to one's identity.

[Freedom lies in universality rather than in the particular **identity**
that **resists universality**. Particular identity is a stumbling block
to overcome, the site of **prejudices** and unthought inclinations**,
incapable** of serving as the basis for emancipation.]{.underline} What
I immediately am is not my essential self but instead what the
ideological structure has made of me[. Identity---conceived as singular
or as an intersection of multiple aspects---is not a basis from which I
can fight against ideology but the **result of ideology's
operations**.]{.underline}

[This **contrasts** it with **universality.** The most important figures
of modern Western philosophy from René Descartes onward see in
universality an alternative to the particular positions that remain
**trapped in their isolation**.]{.underline} 7 These figures did not
necessarily theorize universality correctly, but even in their failures,
they touched on genuine universality and contributed something to a
possible understanding of it. This universalist tradition is one that we
abandon at our peril. [Through a variety of thinkers, it makes clear
that universality is not oppressive but rather the vehicle through which
we can **challenge ideology**. What seems like universality acting in an
oppressive fashion is always some **particular identity passing itself
off as universal**, never the act of an authentic universality. While
authentic universality alienates, it also emancipates through this
alienation, which is what distinguishes it from all
particularisms.]{.underline}

[One of the universals of the **French Revolution**---**solidarity**
---reveals the **relationship between alienation and emancipation**.
While I might feel an inherent solidarity with those closest to
me,]{.underline} like my parents, friends, and even colleagues[, I don't
feel such a bond with those I don't know. I might read about their
suffering and think that this is unfortunate, but I lack the inherent
solidarity that I have with those close by. When I take up solidarity as
a universal value, however, I come to **recognize myself** in the
**suffering of would-be strangers**. If I am to be faithful to the
universality of this value, I cannot simply be what I was and remain in
solidarity only with my intimates. Solidarity emancipates me from my
parochialism as it alienates me from my particular identity. It demands
that I include those outside my orbit in my conception of
solidarity]{.underline}. By doing so, I cease to be who I was and become
alienated, but [I also become **free of my local
prejudices**.]{.underline} Through this turn to universal solidarity, I
lose the natural sentiment of solidarity with those close to me. [But
this alienation creates an emancipating solidarity, one in which I take
the side of those alien to me.]{.underline}

[By making me other than what I immediately am, the universal opens up
the possibility for me to act freely, to act against what my
**ideological programming** tells me to do. Only universality
accomplishes this because only universality gives me distance from my
ideologically given identity.]{.underline} Although emancipatory
political projects might look as if they are identitarian today, [**all
emancipation is universalist, or it is not emancipation**. Even if this
universalism remains unavowed and obfuscated, it is nonetheless a
necessary condition for emancipatory or leftist politics.]{.underline}

### Psycho 2NC -- Link -- POMO 

#### Poststructural theorizing abandons universality as a basis for struggle.

**McGowan, 20**---professor of film studies at the University of Vermont
(Todd, "Universal Villains," *Universality and Identity Politics*,
Chapter 3, ebook)

[Most **left-wing theorists** turned away from universality after
Stalinism without directly commenting on it.]{.underline} With the
exception of Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Paul Sartre, and a few others,
[theorists simply took up a **defense of the particular** as their
**response** to the **gulag**]{.underline}. The silence of Theodor
Adorno on Stalinism is especially conspicuous, given how much time he
devoted to the analysis of Nazism and the individuals who succumbed to
its appeal. [But equally noteworthy is the **lack of analysis** by
figures like Michel **Foucault,** Gilles **Deleuze**, and Jürgen
**Habermas**]{.underline}, just to name a few. [Almost no major theorist
of the generation that emerges during the 1960s tries to theorize why
the communist project went so wrong with Stalin.]{.underline}

[Instead of explicitly critiquing Stalinism for its universality as they
do with Nazism, most theorists tended to **particularize Marxism** in
order to make it more palatable and to **eliminate** the **danger of the
Marxist universal** that Stalinism represents for them. In this vision,
there become **multiple forms** of Marxism. **Stalinism** results from
the **narrowing** of this multiplicity to a single **universal model**.
Stalin oversteps by **taking Marxism too far** in a universal direction,
but we can **retain** Marxism as long as we jettison the universality
that makes it unpalatable.]{.underline}

Here, **[Jacques Derrida]{.underline}** is the representative figure.
Despite Derrida's theoretical distance from Marxism throughout his early
career, toward the end of his life [he attempts to create a new form of
Marxist multiplicity. In his late work Specters of Marx, Derrida
explains the attitude that he advocates, taking up Marx and Marxism in a
**post-gulag world.** The weight of Stalinism leads Derrida away from
any straightforward embrace of Marxism, but at the same time, Derrida
**doesn't** want to **give up Marxism's critical
apparatus.**]{.underline}

Derrida elaborates the relationship between deconstruction and Marxism
in very careful terms. [He **refuses** either to **identify** his
project with Marxism or to reject this identification, but what is most
important is that he **rejects** the conception of Marxism that sees it
as a **unitary and universal** theory.]{.underline} [He states,
"**Deconstruction** has never been Marxist, no more than it has ever
been nonMarxist, although it has remained faithful to a certain spirit
of Marxism, to a least one of its spirits for, and this can never be
repeated too often, there is more than one of them and they are
heterogeneous."]{.underline}29 [For Derrida, we **cannot dismiss**
Marxism, but neither can we continue to sustain it as a **universalizing
project.** To do so is to fall victim to the version of Marxism that led
to the horrors of the twentieth century.]{.underline}

Derrida attempts to align himself with Marxist critique without any
longer being a Marxist in order to avoid any complicity with Stalin.
[Others take a similar path as they **turn away** from Marxism's
**universal** struggle toward a series of **particular** struggles. They
don't advocate total revolution but **particular changes**---toppling of
hierarchies, exploding of binaries, undermining of institutions, and so
on]{.underline}. [This shift occurs as a way of moving **away from** the
**universalism** that supposedly produced a figure like Stalin and the
horror of the gulag.30]{.underline}

[Instead of inspiring suspicion about Marxism's overinvestment in
universality, the Stalinist catastrophe should have led thinkers to see
the **danger of total belonging**. It should have led to a
**revaluation** of the **identification** of the universal with the
ideal of **inclusivity**. But this is not what happened. A series of
thinkers moved away from the universal social analysis provided by
Marxism and toward the analysis of **particular power dynamics**. This
entailed **a turn from Marx to Nietzsche** as the central figure for
emancipatory politics, which was a **disastrous** turn for the
Left.]{.underline}

### Psycho 2NC -- Alt vs K affs

#### Universality solves better---every defense of particularity is actually a defense of the universal in disguise!

**McGowan, 20**---professor of film studies at the University of Vermont
(Todd, "Introduction: Finding Universality," *Universality and Identity
Politics*, Introduction, ebook)

But at the same time, [the widespread suspicion of universality
and]{.underline} corresponding [elevation of identity make possible a
**clarification** of both **universality and identity**]{.underline}.
The political catastrophe is a philosophical opportunity. In the wake of
this political reversal, [we can make clear that universality is not
totalitarian and that particular identity isn't actually outside of
universality]{.underline}. [Universality is at once what is missing in
the totality and the necessary **foundation of every particular
identity**]{.underline}. Paradoxically, the structure of universality
can become fully evident in the aftermath of the political turn against
the universal. [This]{.underline} turn [demands a **reevaluation** of
what universality actually is]{.underline}. The universal is not what it
seems to be. It is not a quality that multiple particulars possess in
common.

**[The universal is what particulars share not having]{.underline}**.
[The **shared absence** of the universal rather than the shared
possession of it **bonds** particulars together]{.underline}. [The key
to an emancipatory politics]{.underline} in the aftermath of Nazism and
Stalinism---and in the epoch of global capitalism---[is the recognition
that the universal is **what we don't have in common**]{.underline} or
[our shared absence]{.underline}.

[Understanding the universal as an absence is the key to thinking about
universality outside the context of the murderous regimes that invoked
it]{.underline}. Stalin can indiscriminately kill peasants that he
labels class traitors because he is imposing the universal on Soviet
society[. But if the universal is an absence---if freedom is not
something that one can impose but something that one **cannot possess**
---then this horror becomes theoretically unimaginable.]{.underline}

[When we think of universality in terms of absence rather than presence,
it ceases to appear as an overarching whole that leaves **no room for
particular difference** and becomes the **basis** for the **subject's
singularity**.]{.underline} I attain my singularity through my embrace
of universal freedom and equality. [For instance, in a gesture of
refusing to participate in a system of segregation or in working to
expose the violent origins of the iPhone, I become who I am through my
contact with universality, through the act that enables me **to free
myself** from my given particular identity]{.underline}---that of an
unthinking segregationist or a cheerful iPhone user.

But the retreat from universality that occurs in the twentieth century
has militated against this possibility. Thanks in part to the efforts of
anti-universalist thinkers, we exist politically in the abeyance of
universality and the prevalence of identity. 20 [**Political struggles
today appear as identitarian** ones, not struggles partaking in the
project of universal emancipation.]{.underline}

[But this situation]{.underline} is not just the result of
anti-universalist theorizing. It [also follows from the structure of
**capitalist society**. **Capitalism engenders identity
politics**]{.underline}. It does so [by **stripping away** the content
of all **particular identity** by imposing the commodity form on every
particularity. This **commodity form is not** a **universal** but an
empty form that necessitates total conformity.]{.underline} Everyone and
everything must be translatable into the commodity form. As a result,
within the capitalist system, the content of every particularity becomes
insignificant. The particular identities of the capitalist and the
worker disappear in their roles as capital and labor in the same way
that the use value of the particular object disappears in its exchange
value as a commodity.

[The structure of capitalism vacates particular identity, leaving
subjects with a contentless abstraction that few find satisfying.
Capitalism's evacuation of identity creates a vacuum that quickly fills.
**Identity politics emerges** in response to the capitalist
system.]{.underline}21 Although there is nothing necessary about the
emergence of identitarian struggles, capitalism is a breeding ground for
them. [Capitalism's emptying out of particular identity through the
general commodity form produces an untenable situation for the subject,
**an existential emptiness** that the **struggle for identity attempts
to fill**. Often, these struggles paint themselves as anti-capitalist or
articulate critiques of aspects of capitalism, but actually their role
in creating a sense of identity for capitalist subjects helps them to
endure the capitalist system.]{.underline}

[Particular identity **cannot be the basis** for the **emancipation** of
every identity because particular identity claims are **inherently in
competition** with other identity claims.]{.underline} [Even if an
identitarian movement claims to advocate peaceful coexistence with other
groups, this claim is necessarily disingenuous. The recognition of one
identity comes at the **expense of others,**]{.underline} which is why
identitarians are always quarrelling about the need to recognize the
specificity of their identity. We can never reach a point of equilibrium
among different identity claims. [As long as a movement insists on its
identity over universality, this equilibrium will remain out of
reach]{.underline}. The only path out of a Hobbesian war of each
identity against all others is that of the universal.

We experience identity as the essence of our subjectivity, but this
experience is profoundly misleading. [Identity, no matter if it seems
intrinsic (like race and sexuality) or the result of a conscious choice
(like club membership and religious affiliation), is always rooted in
the social recognition that sustains it]{.underline}. The most private
form of identity has its origin in the given social possibilities.
Identity politics hides the alienating quality of all identity and thus
has an ideological function.

But [many of the movements that we think of in terms of identity
politics are actually **mislabeled universalist political projects.** We
**must distinguish** between what is identity politics and what is an
appeal to universality burdened by the term identity
politics]{.underline}. [**Protests against racism or sexism, appeals for
gay rights, and calls for rights for trans subjects** all seem to fit
within the typical definition of identity politics. When we look at
these movements closely, however, we can recognize their
**universalist** thrust.]{.underline} It is a mistaken understanding of
both identity and universality that leads us to diagnose these movements
in terms of the former. The turn back to universality does not simply
mean that we must, with Marx, focus on the economy.

As the turn from universality to identity begins to look increasingly
irreversible, the time becomes more urgent for calling out identity as
an ideological trap. The same urgency demands that we rearticulate the
universality that has sustained struggles from the French Revolution to
the Haitian Revolution to the Russian Revolution to the suffragist
movement to the civil rights movement to the Arab Spring. [If certain of
these struggles have failed or have gone horribly awry, we must
recognize that universality hasn't betrayed us**. We have betrayed
it**]{.underline}.22

### Psycho 2NC -- AT: Perm vs K affs

#### The perm fails---starting points are key!

**McGowan, 20**---professor of film studies at the University of Vermont
(Todd, "Our Particular Age," *Universality and Identity Politics*,
Chapter 1, ebook)

[Universality is the lack in every particular]{.underline}. 16 [It is
the insubstantiality of the particular, the dependence of the particular
on what it is not.]{.underline} No particular entity is simply
self-contained and exists on its own. It is always involved with what it
is not.17 [**The universal** is not the other on which the particular
depends but what **makes the particular's selfsufficiency impossible**.
The point at which the **particular cannot sustain itself** in isolation
is the point at which its involvement in **universality becomes
noticeable**]{.underline}. The lack that forges this connectivity is the
site of universality. [If particular objects were self-contained and
isolated, it would be impossible to affect them in any way]{.underline}.
There would be genuine particularity---isolated monads. [But chopping
down a tree or eating a tomato or even skipping a rock across a lake
**reveals the intrusion of universality** in the particularity of these
objects.]{.underline} These are not just collisions of particulars with
other particulars. [**The lack** that makes such collisions possible is
a **universal opening** insofar as it gives the lie to the isolation of
the particular.]{.underline}

[Because it **exists only as an absence**, we can never simply have
universality. The **universal's status** is thus **always in question**,
always subject to doubt and debate.]{.underline} It is never fully
instantiated in the way that Aristotle would have it, [but this status
is what gives universality its transformative potential.]{.underline}
[By **instantiating the universal**, Aristotle **strips** it of its
**power to transform the present** by **reducing it** to the present.
Instantiating the universal has the effect of **hiding
it.**]{.underline}

The link between epistemology and politics is often obscure. But it is
my contention [that a genuine **leftist politics** is ultimately
**incompatible** with an epistemology that begins with **particulars**
(or one that **demands the instantiation of the universal** as Aristotle
does).]{.underline} This is the case not just with conservatism but also
with liberalism, which always shares the conservative epistemological
starting point.

[If the **particular** is the unassailable **beginning of our
thinking**, as conservative and liberal thought have it, we must do
everything we can to **protect this particular** from other particulars
that have conflicting interests.]{.underline} According to this
position, [we begin as isolated beings that form bonds only in order to
preserve ourselves]{.underline}. If we believe that there are only
particulars and that universals are nothing but the constructs that
result from the assembly of these particulars, then it makes sense to
move in the direction of an authoritarian rule that would keep
particulars safe. [The sole point of any social organization would be
maximizing the security of the particular]{.underline}, as it is for
Thomas Hobbes.

#### Err neg on mutual exclusivity---there's no defense of the particular tha doesn't also apply to the universal.

**McGowan, 20**---professor of film studies at the University of Vermont
(Todd, "Our Particular Age," *Universality and Identity Politics*,
Chapter 1, ebook)

[One of the most politically **debilitating errors** of recent thought
is the contention that one must **construct the universal out of
particulars**. According to this position, particulars are given, while
we derive **universals** from the act of **bringing** a series of
**particulars together**]{.underline}. [This epistemological turn is
politically debilitating precisely because it **occurs on the Left
rather than** on the **Right**---its natural home. In contemporary
politics, the **Left retreats** to the **terrain of the particular**,
which is **the Right's terrain.**]{.underline}

This position is fully visible in the contributions from Ernesto Laclau
and Judith Butler to the collection Contingency, Hegemony, Universality.
In different ways, [**Laclau and Butler** voice their **discomfort**
with universality.]{.underline} 26 [This discomfort reveals that they
each **see** the particular as an ontological given and the
**universal** as what we **arrive at** through engagement with multiple
particulars.]{.underline} They are, to put it in the terms from above,
disciples of Aristotle rather than Plato.

This position is not unique to Laclau and Butler among the Left. [They
are representative figures that give voice to what has become the
leftist doxa.]{.underline} [Laclau claims]{.underline}, for instance,
["The 'universal' is never an independent entity, but only the set of
'names' corresponding to an always infinite and reversible relation
between particularities]{.underline}."27 Here[, Laclau advances a
**nominalist philosophy** that **assumes** that **particulars exist**
and that **universals do not**. By **reducing** the **universal** to a
name or set of **names** that indicates how **particulars relate** to
each other, Laclau **eliminates** the **universal's epistemological
priority**, which is the foundation for any sustainable claim to
collective responsibility]{.underline}. [If the only bond between others
and myself is our tenuous relationship, then I am justified in
concerning myself with their interests only insofar as I can reconcile
them with my own]{.underline}. Or at least my commitment to the
collective is less clear than if one assumes that universals exist.

[Butler]{.underline} does not go as far as Laclau down this path, but
she nonetheless [enacts an **epistemological displacement** of the
universal]{.underline}. [Butler contends that we construct the universal
through the act of **negotiating** between competing
**particulars**]{.underline}. If we don't do this, she fears, we risk
falling into what she calls a colonial logic. [Butler states, "Without
translation, the only way the assertion of universality can cross a
border is through a colonial and expansionist logic]{.underline}."28
[Butler sees translation of the universal from particular culture to
particular culture as the only way of **avoiding** falling into the
**trap of the universal's dominance**,]{.underline} which is, in her
eyes, politically undesirable. [From this perspective, the universal
represents **a constant danger** that we must guard against. But it is
such a **danger only when** one takes **particularity as the starting
point**.]{.underline}

Although the idea of beginning with particulars and focusing on our
concern for the particular sounds emancipatory to our contemporary ears,
it does so only because our hearing has become so \[damaged\]
~~impaired~~ by the blaring critique of universalizing, which has been
turned up to eleven. **[If we presuppose that we begin as particulars
and that the universal only arrives through the accumulation of
particulars, then any values that we might try to establish will
inevitably seem like a violent imposition]{.underline}**. The attempt to
defend universal values from the perspective of the priority of the
particular is an effort doomed before it commences. Viable values depend
on the priority of the universal.

[What **results** from the priority of the particular is a world in
which one **critiques** instances of **particular oppression**
**without** any ability to **articulate what values this** oppression
**violates**.]{.underline} We know that particular instances of
oppression are bad, but we have lost touch with why. [This is because we
have **lost touch** with the **universal**. It is only universality that
gives us a reason to **fight collectively** against the wrongs of an
**oppressive** situation.]{.underline}

[One of the great achievements of the **civil rights movement** in the
United States was its insistence on the **universality** of its
struggle. **Lack of equality for black individuals stood for lack of
equality as such. Marches for voting rights made it clear that securing
black voting rights meant securing everyone's freedom**. **The
particular struggle always had a universal backdrop to it**, just like
the Algerians' fight against the French or the Viet Cong's war against
the United States. In each case, the emancipation of some holds within
it universal emancipation.]{.underline}

[Today, we are far removed from this political situation. Now, there is
outcry about the treatment of immigrants, lack of acceptance of the
transgendered, the ongoing environmental catastrophe, or institutional
violence toward black individuals, but there is **no universal ground**
for the outcry or tie that binds all together in a possible
mobilization.]{.underline} Instead, the instances of oppression exist in
a purely particular fashion. [One **enumerates** the **situation** of
immigrants, the transgendered, people of color, the working class, and
so on, while always **leaving room** for the addition of **another
particular** to the group]{.underline}. [The problem with this serial
approach to instances of oppression is not that **one is always in
danger of forgetting one item in the group but that the list of
particulars never adds up to a universal**]{.underline}**.**

[The **grouping** approach to instances of oppression represents an
**indirect refusal** of **universality**.]{.underline} It is the
necessary expression of liberalism that derives from the ruling
particularist epistemology. [The ideological violence of this operation
is the violence that derives from the abdication of
universality.]{.underline} Whereas Butler identifies ideological
violence with the imperial imposition of the universal, there is a much
more brutal kind of violence in our inability to refer to it. [Stuck in
the existence of a group of particulars without recourse to the
universal, the individual endures the **violence** of constantly
**recognizing itself in isolation.**]{.underline} [Without the
emancipatory universal, the individual devolves into the perfect cog in
the **capitalist machine**---taking itself as an isolated particular
while performing the systematic role that capitalism demands. The
**bond** of the group of particulars is only **contingent and
fleeting**, **never emancipatory**.]{.underline}

For the conservative or the liberal, the collective is always on the
verge of collapsing. This is because the universal that holds it
together---a collective link always requires a universal---is
constructed rather than constitutive. As a result, conservatives
constantly try to secure it through appeals to national or ethnic
identity that would create collectivity through exclusion. Conservative
politics has its basis in the opposition between friend and enemy
because this is the only way for the conservative to secure a collective
bond. Liberals suffer from the same tenuousness but avoid the
divisiveness that conservatives use. Instead, liberals advocate forging
the connection through difference. For them, the negotiation of
differences can be the source of our bond.

For the leftist or the proponent of emancipation, the situation is
altogether different. Universality is the condition of possibility for
particulars. It plays a constitutive role relative to its particulars.
As a result, the collective link established through the universal forms
an indissoluble connection. The universal is not a foreign outsider but
an intimate point at which each particular finds itself lacking. Through
this lack, the universal holds the series of particulars together even
when they themselves do not register the connection.

Chapter 3, ebook)

One could even go so far as to say that [the **interpretation** of the
**political catastrophes** of the **twentieth century** was itself
another catastrophe]{.underline}. It produced fewer victims, to be sure,
but [the damage to political thought that it left behind was
long-lasting. Rather than seeing **Nazism** and **Stalinism** as
particular crimes stemming from an **abandonment or distortion of
universality**, the common interpretations of these phenomena
characterized them as instances of the universal's inhuman
barbarism]{.underline}. [These were not **crimes** of the universal, but
this is how most **interpreters** saw them]{.underline}. Interpreters
thus missed that [these were either crimes of **particularity** (in the
case of Nazism) or crimes of a **deviation from the universal** (in the
case of Stalinism).]{.underline} [The deleterious effect of the
predominant interpretation **reverberates** through the theorization of
politics up to the present. We continue to exist in the wake of the
fundamental misinterpretation of the horrors of the twentieth
century.]{.underline}

[Theodor Adorno is perhaps the exemplary figure of this widespread
misinterpretation. Adorno contends that the **eradication of
difference** is **Nazism's** primary **crime**.]{.underline} (He doesn't
talk at length about Stalinism but focuses exponentially more of his
theoretical energy on Nazism.) [His analysis of Nazism **links** its
eradication of difference in the figure of the Jew to the history of
**universalizing German philosophy**. While Adorno locates his own
thought in the dialectical tradition of Hegel and Marx, he also sees
Hegel's universalism as guilty for preparing the way for Nazism's
**annihilation** of the **particular.**]{.underline} 1 Excessive
universality is not just the Nazi sin, but also that of the entire
tradition of Western thought beginning with Homer.

[Adorno's critique of universalism]{.underline}---especially Hegel's---
[reaches its high point]{.underline} toward the end of his life [when he
writes Negative Dialectics]{.underline}. Here, [he attempts to
**defend** the **nonidentity** of the **particula**r against the
onslaught of **universality** that reduces all particular difference to
sameness]{.underline}. In an exemplary passage from this work, [he
writes, "Hegel's transposition of the particular into particularity
follows the practice of a society that tolerates the particular only as
a category, a form of the supremacy of the universal]{.underline}."2
[Philosophies such as Hegel's err when they **reduce particular
difference to nothing** but a part of a universal system]{.underline}.
Although Hegel is not to blame for the rise of Nazism[, a philosophy
that ceaselessly **champions** the "supremacy of the universal" and that
has no concern for the particular not under the sway of the universal
offers a paradigm for mass annihilation]{.underline}.3 According to this
view, [it is a small step from Hegel's supremacy of the universal to
Nazism's Aryan supremacy]{.underline}. 4 [Adorno insists on proclaiming
**the irreducibility of particular difference** because it provides a
way to respond to what he perceives as the universal violence of
Auschwitz]{.underline}.5 He argues that ethics after Auschwitz must
focus on particular difference rather than universality. If universality
is to blame for Auschwitz, then we must call universality into question.

[This type of **theoretical** judgment about Nazism as an **exaggerated
universalism** makes strange bedfellows, which testifies to its
ubiquity]{.underline}. It is not just one group of thinkers that makes
this judgment but thinkers from vastly different camps---conservatives
and leftists, anarchists and Marxists, parliamentary democrats and
revolutionaries. This shared verdict on Nazism brings otherwise alien
thinkers into proximity with each other through its production of near
unanimity across the political spectrum. One cannot imagine Hannah
Arendt, Gilles Deleuze, Leo Strauss, Michel Foucault, Karl Popper, and
Theodor Adorno agreeing on anything at all. But they are united in their
verdict on Nazism and Stalinism. They all see Nazism and Stalinism as
the result of as excessive investment in the universal.

[By imagining that Nazism and Stalinism represent universal crimes or
crimes of the universal, theorists **slander universality** and
transform it into a political sin to be avoided]{.underline}. [This is
where we still stand today. In the **aftermath** of this **theoretical
distortion**, **emancipatory politics** becomes the assertion of
**particular identity** rather than the striving for
universality---which means that emancipatory politics **ceases to be
emancipatory politics**, because **emancipation depends on the
universal**]{.underline}. [This misstep **results** in the **Left**
paradoxically **fighting** on the **turf of the Right**, since
**conservatism** is essentially the **propagation of particular
identity** against what it sees as the danger of the universal. When we
lament the ease with which right-wing populism wins adherents today, it
is this slanted turf that we are lamenting.]{.underline}

[Furthermore, the **misinterpretation** of Nazism and Stalinism as
**crimes of the universal** has the effect of **depoliticizing**
them.]{.underline} [Once they become instances of universalist
overreach, the sensible **response turns** out **to be an ethical
rather** **than** a **political** one: one must respect particular
difference]{.underline}. We must take refuge in the ethical treatment of
the other in order to avoid political violence toward this other. 6 To a
large extent[, the prosecution of this ethical demand **replaces
politics**]{.underline}.7 [The ethics that replaces politics is not a
Kantian ethic that foregrounds its universality but one that sees
**universality as the ethical problem** that it demands we avoid by
respecting particular difference.]{.underline}

[But the ethical call to respect particular difference seems especially
**misguided** when we take a closer look at the politics of Nazism and
Stalinism]{.underline}. [Of course, neither Nazism nor Stalinism was
guilty of exhibiting too much respect for particular difference. But
that said, **Nazism** perpetuated **mass murder** on the basis of an
**ontology of particular difference**, and **Stalinism** did so by
conceiving of a **particularized version** of **universality** that
tried to **liquidate the enemy** that blocked its
realization.]{.underline}

[In this sense, the violence of Nazism and Stalinism is distinct. One
cannot reasonably blend the two together under a single label, such as
totalitarianism. But they do **both** partake in a **betrayal** of the
**universal**.]{.underline}8 [In contrast to how theorists of the
twentieth century treated them, they were **political rather than
ethical horrors**, horrors that arose directly from the turn away from
universalist politics. The **misinterpretation** of these movements has
**undermined** the possibility for **universality**. The theoretical
legacy of the response to Nazism and Stalinism is an **ethical turn**
that **leaves us politically \[ruined\]** ~~crippled~~.]{.underline}9

Interdependence in Deliberative Systems

[After an almost hegemonic focus on the design and execution of
minipublics as sites of deliberative democracy, the systemic turn
acknowledges that "**deliberative democracy cannot easily be sought in a
single forum**" but rather exists and requires "the contributions of
multiple sites,"34]{.underline} [including "]{.underline}formal and
binding assemblies," "interest groups," "media," and ["everyday
\[political\] talk]{.underline}."35 It recognizes that ["political
systems in developed democracies are complex, with numerous sites of
politics, multiple separations of functions that require coordination,
and many points of pressure, entry and influence]{.underline}."36
[Deliberative systems,]{.underline} by definition, [function through
relationships between interdependent, rather than autonomous, citizens
and institutions.]{.underline}

Much of political theory, in general, and deliberative democratic
theory, in particular, has conceptualized the ideal citizen as an
autonomous agent. Autonomy was, in fact, seen as both a precondition and
a potential outcome of deliberation. For example, Amy Gutmann and Dennis
Thompson, in their account of deliberative democracy, argue that
[individuals "should be treated not merely as objects of legislation, as
passive subjects to be ruled, but as autonomous agents who take part in
the governance of their own society, directly or through their
representatives."]{.underline}37 At the same time, [the cultivation of
autonomous citizenship is also a positive potential outcome of public
discussion in deliberative democracy]{.underline}.38 Autonomy is both
needed before and expected after deliberation.

Such a relationship with autonomy is directly tied to deliberative
democracy's historical origins. Deliberative democracy, especially those
based on Habermas's conception of it, retains "his liberal Kantianism,"
which emphasizes autonomy.39 However, [even as a theorist of "autonomy,"
Kant's account of critical thinking and dialogue offers a vision of
individuals who are far from autonomous and are, indeed, fully
interdependent on one another.]{.underline}40 For Kant, "[we cannot
engage in any project]{.underline}---be it finding the limits of reason,
ascertaining the principles of moral law, or [engaging a
rational-critical debate]{.underline} aimed at securing legitimacy and
driving progress---[without others to share the burden]{.underline}."41
This means that [interdependence of citizens on one another is an
unspoken, disregarded, and forgotten assumption of deliberative
democratic theory]{.underline}.42

[This recognition of the interdependence of citizens]{.underline} and
institutions on one another, [when taken seriously and applied to
deliberative democratic participation, can decenter and refocus
it.]{.underline} **[It pushes us to consider how possible it is for us
to deliberate without others]{.underline}**.43 Recognizing this fact
explicitly allows us to reflect on the different ways in which all
citizens and institutions are dependent on one another within the larger
deliberative system. [Instead of being solely concerned with individual
contributions, it now accepts that we need others to enable our full
participation as citizens.]{.underline}

Systemic turn recognizes that citizens do not participate the same way
and to the same degree all the time. Instead, a deliberative system is
one of "division of labor" among different and interdependent parts,
groups, and individuals.44 In other words, similar to the way that
different sites of deliberation are interdependent on one another to
ensure the overall health of the system, [participants, too, depend on
one another to ensure ample as well as quality participation and
deliberation,]{.underline} "whether they \[personally and continuously\]
are speaking or not."45

What does interdependent citizenship look like? First, it recognizes
that "depending on the particular stage we are at in the life cycle as
well as the degree to which the world is structured to respond to some
variations better than others,"46 we are all mutually interdependent.
[This recognition reframes dependence as a universal feature of the
system as opposed to a distinct feature that sets CD individuals apart
from others]{.underline}. [The dependence of CD individuals, even at
higher rates than the able-minded, is no longer a difference of kind;
rather it is one of degrees.]{.underline}

Second, it emphasizes that [the dependency in interdependency is not "an
antonym to autonomy or freedom \[. . .\] but its precondition and
correlate]{.underline}."47 Interdependence, therefore, is posited as
part of the human condition. An interdependent account of citizenship
means that [we can relax the standards of participation in the public
sphere in a way that does not require autonomous, individual, and
independent contributions at all times]{.underline} and under all
circumstances. Moreover, such a move is no longer presented as
antithetical to the aims or the development of deliberative democratic
theory.

[Deliberative systems approach allows us to better take stock of the
different modes and degrees of participation by citizens]{.underline}.
Some contributions do not meet the previously held deliberative ideal of
autonomy and some require others for their formulation and expression.
Interdependent citizenship in the context of deliberative democracy
means that moments where communicative and/or technical assistance are
required to make participation possible are not anomalies but a feature
of participation in a deliberative system. Indeed, we can imagine a
spectrum of sorts that tracks the participation of the CD. On one end,
CD individuals participate with very little assistance from others; on
the other end, more robust translation takes place in order for us to
include those who interact and convey their interests in alternative
ways. Severely cognitively disabled individuals, for example, cannot
meaningfully participate on their own or be discursive representatives
(see below). However, their participation can be accommodated through
the inclusion of their caregivers. Contributions to the deliberative
system can take place, while receiving assistance from others, in a
manner not much different from everyone else.

In the next sections, I outline the specific ways in which the systemic
turn with its recognition of interdependence has opened up opportunities
for participation of CD individuals. These are: (1) a more generous
account of deliberative speech acts and behaviors; (2) recognition of
the role enclaves; and (3) incorporating the role of discursive
representatives. These changes normalize the participation of CD
individuals and suggest institutional opportunities for more effective
participation.

1\. Expanding the Scope of Speech Acts

As noted in the previous section, the deliberative systems approach
envisages participation in the public sphere as a form of "division of
labor." [This means that it does not require "every citizen \[. . .\] to
be equally knowledgeable" or to "become an ideal deliberator" in order
to meet the deliberative ideal at every moment or instance of
deliberation]{.underline}.48

This is an important and consequential shift[. Much of the literature on
deliberative democracy has focused on deliberative ideals---sets of
desired preconditions and behaviors---that have to be met in order for a
deliberative democratic endeavor to be deemed successful.]{.underline}
The aim has been to design settings that match the ideal deliberative
conditions with the hopes that the setup can guarantee the fulfilment of
the desired outcomes associated with deliberation. [These ideals have
similarly been used to judge the quality of speech in highly controlled
deliberative moments]{.underline}.49

These ideals, however, have been the source of much criticism lodged
against deliberative democracy. Put simply, **[critics have pointed to
the ways in which ideals of rational and dispassionate discourse can
limit the full participation of the most marginalized members of society
and contribute to the reproduction of gaps in discursive time and
influence.]{.underline}**50

[The deliberative systems approach comes out of the recognition that
these ideals are likely unachievable in practice in every instance of
deliberation]{.underline}. [While we may try to replicate these ideal
preconditions and behaviors within highly structured small
deliberations, communication on the ground is messier and more
complicated]{.underline}. The deliberative systems approach acknowledges
that [requiring everyone]{.underline}, who might be in very different
social and political positions of power and influence in society**[, to
follow the same rules will likely undermine the emancipatory potential
of deliberative democracy.]{.underline}** As such, **[it expands the
range of acceptable behaviors to include behaviors that were previously
considered "nondeliberative" and even "antideliberative."]{.underline}**

[An example of such behavior is that of activists and hard partisans
who]{.underline} often [engage in behavior that is characteristically
antideliberativ]{.underline}e but increase the overall health of a
deliberative system by opening it up to " \[new\] voices, interests,
perspectives, and claims."51 Other [examples of antideliberative
behavior can include "Kill cops" or "All my heroes kill
cops"---]{.underline}both of which [have been used in protests against
police brutality. Alternatively, "All men are trash" or "Men are scum"
are examples of antideliberative statements made during the height of
#MeToo movement on Facebook and Twitter]{.underline}. While [these
speech acts do not fit the deliberative ideal of respect]{.underline},
[the systems approach does not dismiss them since they are statements
made by members of groups who have been historically marginalized and
have been victims of failures of reciprocity]{.underline}.52
Furthermore, the meanings of these statements are different from their
first-order interpretation[. Their intention is to open dialogue to
include issues that are easily, historically, and structurally
ignored]{.underline}---antiblack racism and sexual harassment and
assault. Therefore, far from being defects[, these speech acts fulfil
deliberative goals by ensuring "new agendas, broader inclusions,
publicity for important causes, consciousness raising, and information
transmission.]{.underline}"53

I retain the term nondeliberative and antideliberative since they are
discussed as such in the literature on deliberative democracy. While
this may denote that such behaviors are valued less, this is not the
intention. They are seen as necessary, especially, in cases where
speakers are marginalized and lack political and social power. In these
cases, [speech acts that do not strictly follow norms of respect and
reciprocity are seen as a byproduct of the "material and political
inequality and failures of reciprocity" that underpin the political
system and are thus permissible.]{.underline}54

They are called so to distinguish them from the strict standards of
behavior previously identified and touted by us (deliberative democratic
theorists). [The systemic turn does away with the belief that certain
(deliberative) contributions are valuable while others (antideliberative
and nondeliberative) are not.]{.underline} The purpose behind the use of
such terms as opposed to deliberative is to highlight the exact fact
that a deliberative system requires speech acts that are not strictly
deliberative. 55

[People with cognitive disabilities who face marginalization,
inequality, and failures of reciprocity fit this mandate]{.underline}.
While the literature on deliberative systems approach has been silent on
whether we can expand the definition and scope of what counts as
deliberative speech beyond verbal communication, its concern with
including as many ideas, perspectives, voices, and claims necessitates
this expansion nonetheless. **[This means that their participation, even
if it does not conform to previously held deliberative ideals, is not
only justified but considered valuable in a deliberative
system.]{.underline}**56

What does this look like? First, [it would involve moving beyond simply
"\[making\] transparent the reasonings behind position]{.underline}s"57
[to publicizing not only the experiences of individuals and groups but
also highlighting the ways in which their manner of living in the world
might substantially and meaningfully differ from our own]{.underline}.

For example, [imagine a public deliberation over government funding for
music programs in schools, in community or assisted living facilities,
and in part-day community centers.]{.underline} [Reasons for such
funding would include a range of interests from the importance of art
and music in boosting cognitive development, to reducing stress, to
preserving cultural heritage]{.underline}. However, [for CD
people]{.underline}, their parents, and their caregivers,
[music]{.underline} does not only have therapeutic benefits58 but [often
serves as a method of communication]{.underline}---a way for CD
individuals to express their mood, interests, and even ideas. Consider
the case of a CD individual who enjoys, demonstrated through smiles and
movements, listening to Bach concertos suddenly not reacting or reacting
negatively to the music---preferring instead, perhaps, Brahms string
quintets. Such a shift may indicate a change in musical interests, a
desire for fresh music, or perhaps physical or mental unease or illness.

Alternatively, consider the case of Jam2Jam, an online tool that
"provides the resources for \[. . .\] loosely structured musical
performances" or jamming.59 Jam2Jam is innovative, as it enables
improvisation through easy drag and drop tools and "the opportunity to
develop musical ideas through the observation and imitation of
others,"60 encouraging both "experimentation and engagement"61 and a
robust exercise of aesthetic agency for individuals with intellectual
disability.

[These examples demonstrate how the description of lived experiences
that are radically and meaningfully different from ours can form the
basis of a reason that we would not have had access to
otherwise]{.underline}. If music is seen as necessary for communication
and expression of agency, our assessment of its importance and its
associated costs will be radically different than if we conceive of it
merely as a tool for cognitive development or a product of our culture.

Second, **[it requires an acknowledgement that these contributions might
not be made in exactly the same way or to the same degree as those
members of society who are able-bodied and able-minded]{.underline}**.
[These contributions may be made through embodied
participation]{.underline}, including body posture, stance, and facial
expressions. They also include partial or intermittent speech and
assisted speech through caregivers or communication devices, as well as
writing, typing, or pointing using purpose-built tools.

**[Expanding the scope of allowable contributions means that
participation can be embodied in addition to, or even instead of,
verbal]{.underline}**.62 [Embodied participation or "the physical
presence of disabled bodies \[and minds\]" can "\[provoke\] new
conversations similar to rational speech acts."]{.underline}63 Once
again, this is not radically different for able-minded and able-bodied
individuals. We frequently convey messages and pose questions using
nonverbal cues and gestures. Think of "an awkwardly placed elbow and a
subtly raised eyebrow,"64 or a nod and a smile, and how they can affect
a conversation. Since we take notice of such behavior when they are
carried out by able-bodied and able-minded individuals, it makes little
sense to exclude such behavior as forms of participation when they are
exhibited by CD individuals.

This expansion also encompasses partial and assisted speech and takes
into account the importance of the role that may be played by caregivers
by supporting or, in some cases, even contributing in place of those
with disabilities. Under these circumstances participation may rely on
"collaborative speech" that coordinates "speech and actions \[. . .\]
among differently situated" individuals.65 In doing so, it
"\[integrates\] the political needs of individuals who have little
ability to articulate their own demands."66 Such collaboration may
require mediation from coaches and translators. This may take the form
of, first, translating the communication from other participants,
experts, and written material into more easily understandable language
for CD individuals, and second, translating the communications of CD
participants to others, if need be.67 This requires us to, first, be
sensitive to the specific ways in which CD people can claim their voice
within deliberative systems and the particular forms of accommodation
that they may need in order to do so.

Second, it [highlights the importance of communicative responsiveness on
the part of the collaborators in order to ensure that the speech best
represents the volitions of CD individuals.]{.underline} Communicative
responsiveness refers to the degree to which the caregiver responds to
the reactions of the person they are representing. Being responsive
requires continuous reflection and checking in on the part of the
caregiver to ensure the accuracy of his or her interpretation and
satisfaction of the represented.68 Without robust communicative
responsiveness, we run the risk of undermining CD subjects' ability to
claim their own voice and exercise their agency within deliberative
systems by assuming that our situated understanding and interpretations
of their needs, views, and goals are objective.69

[Decolonization]{.underline}, Take 1: [Ukraine and Russia]{.underline}¶
Writing in e-flux journal (and reprinted in left-wing German magazine
Taz), Oleksiy Radynski, filmmaker and cofounder of Kyïv's Visual Culture
Research Center, astutely untangles the deeply colonialist underpinnings
of Putin's war on Ukraine and Ukrainians. In "The Case Against the
Russian Federation," Radynski briefly pursues two fascinating lines of
argument. (Each of them has been developed in greater depth by others,
but not to my knowledge combined in such a concise and currently
relevant way, thus my focus on it here.)¶ The first argues that Putin's,
and many Russians', anti-Ukrainianism---the "deep ethnic and political
hatred towards Ukrainians" evident in his recent speeches---is a
disavowal of that which threatens them internally. Ukraine today
represents "a radically different Russia," with the disavowal working in
both directions.¶ [What Putin calls the "historical unity" of both
nations refers to centuries of imperial domination by
Russia]{.underline} ... We \[Ukrainians\] share with Russians a history
of serfdom (a form of de facto slavery in the Russian Empire), worker
movements, revolution, industrialization, and war. Generations of our
families have mixed with each other. But any relationship between
metropole and colony---like any master-slave relationship---is
dialectical and reciprocal ...¶ By colonizing Ukraine, the Russian
metropole had unwittingly swallowed a political culture based on
horizontal forms of democracy---even if they seem brutal, like the
Cossacks' councils, the anarchist armies of Nestor Makhno, or the Maidan
uprisings. And this alien presence will disintegrate the metropole from
within. In a way, the Putinist fear of a "Russian Maidan" uprising in
Moscow is totally justified---but not because, as Russian propaganda
suggests, it will be organized by NATO-trained Ukrainian terrorists. The
fear is justified because, if Russians are a little bit Ukrainian, they
might also be able to topple an authoritarian government ... It is this
"historical unity" that today's autocratic Russia is trying by all means
to exorcize from within itself by turning Russia into a police state and
preempting the popular uprising.¶ In other words, [**Ukraine threatens
to topple the "historical unity" of Russian imperialism---so (for Putin)
it must be vanquished**.]{.underline}¶ Radynski's second line of
argument is that the latter, [**Russian imperialism**, is **at root** a
Slavic and eastward variation on the European **settler colonial**ism
that expanded across the Americas and beyond. Far from simply expanding
to peacefully settle the lands to the east of their Kyïvan Rus'
"homeland,"]{.underline} as it is often imagined, expansion to the east,
north, and south [involved "the genocide of indigenous
populations"]{.underline} (Finno-Ugric and Turkic speaking peoples,
among others), ["the extraction of resources, and the emergence of
autocratic governance."]{.underline}¶ As mentioned, Radynski's arguments
are not original (nor are they intended as that), and there are others
who have developed them in more detailed and refined form. For instance,
on Russian colonization of the Siberian Far East, see Forsyth 1994;
Stephan 1994; Wood 2011; Pesterev 2015. On Russian imperial coloniality
more generally, including self-exculpatory discourses of
"self-colonization," see Sunderland 2000; Morrison 2012; Tlostanova
2012; Etkind 2013 and 2015; Eskanian 2015; and this beautifully
illustrated 2020 article by Engelhardt; and in relation to Ukraine,
Chernetsky 2003; Velychenko 2004; Sakwa 2015; this 2020 panel; and
Badior 2022. And that's just a smattering.¶ Radynski concludes,
provocatively, by advocating that¶ [Kyiv]{.underline} accept its
thousand-year-old historical [responsibility towards the colonized
nations oppressed in today's Russia]{.underline}n Federation by
belatedly acknowledging itself as [the unfortunate origin of a despotic,
colonialist Russian state]{.underline}---a state that oppresses every
people with the misfortune of being within its territory, including the
Russian people. For the sake of all these peoples---and the rest of
humankind---the [Russian state in its current form should cease to
exist.]{.underline}¶ [In this intentionally provocative version of
decolonization, Kyïv, the Ukrainian capital, would reclaim its
(colonial/postcolonial) mantle of "mother of Russian cities" to play a
leading role in the decolonization of this entire part of the
world]{.underline}, which has hitherto been largely neglected by
decolonial theory elsewhere. Decolonialism as a liberatory process would
thus proceed through Kyïv, with this thousand-year-old capital now an
"obligatory passage point" for it (as actor-network theory might call
it).¶ [Decolonization]{.underline}, Take 2: [Russia and the
World]{.underline}¶ Here's where things get trickier. Arguments about
decolonization rest upon an understanding of the identity of the
colonizer. [A nuanced historical analysis can critically distinguish
between British, French, Spanish, Russian, and other forms of colonial,
as well as imperial, power. **A less nuanced, but more globally
palatable, understanding** typically **takes aim** instead **at the
broad and loose category of "the West,"** while placing itself
ostensibly in the service of the non-West, that is, "the
rest.]{.underline}" Each of these approaches has its virtues (Europe,
speaking generically, did indeed colonize the world), but each also
carries risks. (See here for an example of a poorly informed
"decolonial" analysis of the invasion of Ukraine.)¶ Let's put this in
the context of [the "war for hearts and minds" being played out in
global media]{.underline}. As Carl Miller's Twitter analysis has shown[,
**Russian information warfare** may not be doing so well in the West
during the present invasion---it's mainly succeeded in fragmentary
pockets of the far right]{.underline} (and far left). [But it appears to
be **doing** much **better in the non-West, especially** the **BRICS**
countries (Brazil, India, China, South Africa)]{.underline} and other
parts of Africa and Asia, where it may in fact be strategically aimed.
Mother Jones's Ali Brelan makes the same argument, and notes that the US
right wing has just started getting in on the pro-Putin action. Another
take on Russian social media strategy is that it is focusing on being
feared rather than being loved, and that it is succeeding better with
that.¶ As I argued in my recent piece on Noam Chomsky, one of the
lessons of this invasion is that we live in an unstable and multipolar
world, and if our analytical lenses remain fixated on Europe and the
Atlantic world, we will fail to recognize what's happening.¶ A thinker
who has argued this for a long time, but who has also weaponized it on
behalf of Russian neo-imperialism, is Alexander Dugin (who's been
covered on this blog numerous times). Like decolonial thinkers who
emphasize the need to rebalance "the West versus the rest," taking the
side of the latter, Dugin sets himself up as the geopolitical theorist
for "the rest."¶ Like a specific (but not dominant) strand of decolonial
thinkers, he maps this ["West versus rest" duality onto the opposition
of tradition versus progress, where the West is corrupting the fabric of
traditional society, which was "organic," "holistic," "rooted," and so
on.]{.underline} "With the Enlightenment," Dugin writes,¶ the [**West
entered** a totally **artificial civilization based on** wrong
ideas---such as progress, materialism, **technology**, capitalism,
selfishness and atheism]{.underline}. That was the
Enlightenment---Luciferian pride, the war against the Heaven. **[That
coincides with Western colonial expansion]{.underline}**. [Colonialism
was a kind of projection of the same disease on the global scale. No
civilization concentrated so much effort on the material aspect of life
as the West.]{.underline} The Chinese discovered the powder long ago but
used it in order to make beautiful fireworks. It was a kind of cultural
and artist phenomena. When Europeans discovered the same gunpowder, they
started immediately to kill each other and all other peoples. [Western
hegemony is based on disease so we should recognize the Western
civilization of modernity as the pathology.]{.underline}

[At the inception of the Martial Law period, the **Nationalist
government** asserted its territorial claim on China, Taiwan, and other
surrounding islands, and contrived to impose a unified Han Chinese
national and cultural identity upon every single person on the
island.]{.underline} By doing so, [it **consolidated its ruling power as
well as its political legitimacy**]{.underline} because it represented
the "authentic Chinese polity," as opposed to the People's Republic of
China (PRC) the Chinese Communist party established. Alternative voices
or dissent against this official Nationalist ideology were either
brutally repressed or severely silenced. However, the Nationalist
political and cultural hegemony was challenged beginning in the 1970s
due to a process of social transformation and intellectual transition.
The "nativist literature movement" (鄉土文學運動 xiangtu wenxue
yundong), a literary movement that took shape in the mid-1960s and
further prospered during the 1970s, called for a closer connection of
literature with the land and its people on the island of Taiwan via a
more realistic mode of literary expression. This movement served as a
counter-discourse against the predominant anti-Communist literature
(反共文學 fangong wenxue) and nostalgic literature (懷鄉文學 huaixiang
wenxue) that the Nationalist government propagandized. Later, the
Formosa Incident (美麗島事件 Meilidao shijian, also known as the
Kaohsiung Incident)3 in 1979 not only marked a watershed of
democratization movements in Taiwan history, but more importantly, paved
the way for the founding of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in
1986. The above nativist literature movement, as well as the
democratization and localization movements since the 1970s, served as
social and historical backdrop to the ideological debate between the
"Chinese complex" and "Taiwanese complex" in the early 1980s. The rising
of "Taiwanese consciousness" (in contrast to the "Chinese consciousness"
that the Nationalist government imposed), as well as a variety of social
movements during the 1980s, urged the Nationalist government to lift the
Martial Law in 1987, putting an end to the thirty-eight year-long
martial law era.¶ In these circumstances, postcolonial discourse was
introduced to Taiwan's academe and became a prevailing theoretical
paradigm of Taiwan literature studies beginning in the 1990s. The
academic trend of postcolonial theory began with Han Taiwanese literary
scholar Chiu Kuei-fen's seminal essay, "Discover Taiwan: Constructing
the Postcolonial Discourse of Taiwan," presented at the sixteenth annual
Republic of China Comparative Literature conference in 1992. This essay
led to a series of debates between Chiu and another Taiwan-based
literary scholar Liao Chao-yang centering on whether or not Taiwan is a
postcolonial state.4 Chiu defined Taiwan as a postcolonial society by
stressing [**Taiwan's translingual and cross-cultural condition
attributed to its history of multiple colonialisms**.]{.underline} Liao
questioned Chiu's argument, noting that although Taiwan can be
considered a multicultural and multilingual society, the national
language (Mandarin Chinese) is still the dominant language promoted by
the Nationalist ideological policy after 1945. Therefore, the hybrid and
multilingual characteristics of Taiwan, Liao argued, do not constitute a
basis for Taiwan's postcoloniality. Between 1995 and 1996, their debate
about Taiwan's postcoloniality triggered a more intense wave of debates
among other scholars from diverse disciplines. These debates were
published in Chung-wai Literary Monthly (中外文學 Chungwai wenxue, now
renamed Chung-wai Literary Quarterly), one of the leading journals of
literary and cultural studies in Taiwan. Further debates in the late
1990s involved the issues of whether Taiwan is postcolonial or
postmodern, of the rise of Taiwanese consciousness and the politics of
Taiwanese identity and subjectivity, and of Taiwan's nationhood/
statehood.5¶ In hindsight, it is clear that the advent of postcolonial
discourse in Taiwan is significant to the formation of Taiwanese
political, national and cultural identity, as it offers critical and
theoretical insights to conceptualize Taiwan's colonial past. More
importantly, postcolonial criticism has significantly contributed to the
study of Taiwan literature as an autonomous discipline. [During the
Nationalist authoritarian era, Mandarin Chinese was the national
language of Taiwan. Speaking other languages, such as Hakka, Minnan or
Hoklo, Japanese, or several Austronesian languages spoken by the
indigenous peoples, was censored. While the studies of Chinese
literature or Sinology were favored by the Nationalist government,
Taiwan literature, and other studies associated with or relevant to
Taiwan, were considered valueless, if not treated as a taboo, during
this period.]{.underline} In this sense, the insights of [postcolonial
theory and historiography which acknowledge the historical subjectivity
and cultural hybridity of Taiwan became a useful and critical lever to
foreground the specificity and uniqueness of Taiwan literature as a
distinct field of study against the hegemony of Chinese studies or
Sinology]{.underline} that the KMT advocated. As Taiwan literature
scholar Lee Yu-lin aptly states, postcolonial criticism has been
introduced to Taiwan as a theory to supplement the nativist discourse
beginning in the 1970s by providing more critical and complicated
methodologies and theoretical concepts.6 The peaceful transition of
power from the KMT to the DPP in 2000 and the support of
institutionalization of Taiwan literature by the DPP government further
consolidated the discursive primacy of postcolonial theory. In short,
postcolonial studies in Taiwan and Taiwan literature as a distinct field
of study, together with the institutionalization of Taiwan literature,
have been intimately intertwined, supplementing and complementing one
another.7¶ Even with such theoretical primacy, some scholars have
continued to question the applicability of postcolonial theory in
Taiwan. Liao Ping-hui has persuasively pointed out that the KMT
recolonization after the February 28 Incident in 1947,8 and the
expelling of Taiwan from the United Nations in 1971 led to the
"belatedness" of postcoloniality in Taiwan, since the former led to the
White Terror of the KMT rule and the Order of Martial Law promulgated by
the Governor of Taiwan Province Chen Cheng (陳誠) in 1949, and a series
of setbacks in the international arena further delayed Taiwan's entry
into the postcolonial condition.9 As a result, postmodernism, in Liao's
view, had been taken by some scholars as a "substitute project" for this
"belated postcoloniality" to reconsider multiculturalism and
multilingualism of Taiwan's society. By the same token, Liou Liang-ya
also argues that Taiwan's history of multiple colonialisms and the lack
of transitional justice after lifting the Martial Law in 1987 had
further deferred Taiwan's postcolonial project, and thus the
postcoloniality of Taiwan, in comparison to several other newly
established independent nations around the world, is "belated." 10 Liou
then reminds us that we need to more prudently reconsider what has
constituted Taiwan's postcoloniality and whether or not Taiwan has
entered the postcolonial phase at all. Although Liou maintains this
cautious attitude toward postcolonial discourse and its theoretical
applicability, she still believes that the insights of postcolonial
theory as well as the texts of postcolonial fiction in Taiwan not only
critique the Nationalist government's recolonization and authoritarian
rule of Taiwan but also address "issues such as gender, race, and class
in relation to Taiwanese identity and Taiwan's colonial past" as opposed
to the China-centered Nationalist historiography.11¶ As scholars noted,
another problematic of postcolonial studies in Taiwan lies in its
dualistic construct of the colonizer and the colonized. As Li Cheng-Chi
and Lee Yu-lin have argued in their article, "The Problematics of the
Postcolonial Project in Taiwan," [the dialectic paradigm of
postcolonialism]{.underline} (the colonizer vs. the colonized,
domination vs. resistance) [is an oversimplified paradigm for the study
of Taiwan's colonial history. Because of the belatedness of
postcoloniality and the marginalized international status of Taiwan
under the dual impact of the global neocolonialism and the rising power
of China, they contend that Taiwan's postcolonial project should instead
understand its own limitation and insufficiency.]{.underline}12 They
thus propose that it is imperative to reexamine the dichotomy of
postcolonial dialectics within the formation of knowledge production in
Taiwan and reconsider the history of serial and multiple colonialisms of
Taiwan at the intersection of different empires, races, ethnicities,
classes, gender, and so forth. [**The postcolonial project in Taiwan**,
they conclude, **will remain "an incomplete project,"**]{.underline} if
we fail to recognize its theoretical inadequacy and incompatibility with
Taiwan's reality and its far more complicated colonial history.¶ Despite
their divergent views on Taiwan's postcoloniality, we should note that
they are all predominately articulated from a Han-centered perspective
and periodization of history. According to the orthodox Nationalist
historiography, [Taiwan has entered its postcolonial phase right after
the Japanese colonial government retreated in 1945. But for most of the
Han Taiwanese people who lived through the Japanese colonial period and
suffered from KMT's recolonization, it is 1987, the year in which the
Martial Law was lifted, that should be regarded as the beginning of the
postcolonial era.]{.underline} For the indigenous peoples in Taiwan,
[**postcoloniality** is not just "belated"]{.underline} (as described by
Liao and Liou)[, but rather, **has "not yet" come into being.** If the
"post-" in "post-colonialism" can be understood in temporal terms, then
the colonial condition, **from the perspective of Taiwan indigenous
peoples, has not yet come to an end**.]{.underline} Sun Ta-chuan
(Paelabang Danapan), one of the leading indigenous intellectuals,13 has
protested that there will always be theoretical blind spots if Taiwan's
postcolonial studies and Taiwanese nativist discourse fail to take
indigenous peoples into consideration. 14 Genetically and linguistically
speaking, the indigenous peoples of Taiwan are peoples of the
Austronesian language group, and have inhabited Taiwan (and other
surrounding islands) for thousands of years, far before the seventeenth
century arrival of Han immigrants from China.15 [These Han immigrants
from China became the demographic majority of Taiwan's population in the
late seventeenth century attributable to the settlement policies of the
Dutch colonial government and the first Han regime that Zheng Chenggong
established. These Han immigrants and their descendants have not stopped
their exploitation of the indigenous peoples over natural resources and
land.]{.underline} On top of the dispossession of land and resources
throughout history, **[Taiwan indigenous peoples have been subject to
both racial/ethnic discrimination and structural violence via mainstream
Han settler society for hundreds of years.]{.underline}** Specifically,
[**indigenous peoples have long been stigmatized as "uncivilized
groups"** and categorized into "cooked savages"]{.underline} (熟番
shufan, an ethnic construct that refers to the indigenous population who
occupy the plain areas of Taiwan) [and "raw savages"]{.underline} (生番
shengfan, generally referring to the aborigines who lived in the
mountains) [since the Qing period. During the ROC era, the indigenous
populations were relegated to the derogatory category of "mountain
compatriots"]{.underline} (山胞 shanbao), [while plains indigenous
groups were considered "civilized" and were assimilated into the body of
Han settler society via cohabitation and intermarriage with early Han
settlers.]{.underline} Not until very recently were some plains
indigenous communities recognized as indigenous peoples and renamed as
the Pingpu indigenous peoples (平埔族 pingpuzu) in order to make a
distinction between the two categories of indigenous population. [The
disavowal of the Pingpu indigenous status by Han settler regimes caused
the loss of cultural practice and ethnic identity of the plains
indigenous communities.]{.underline} Today, many of the plains
indigenous tribes are still struggling for official recognition. Belated
official apologies by President Tsai Ing-wen on August 1, 2016,
unfortunately, did not bring about forgiveness from the indigenous
peoples. Rather this official attempt provoked, even deeper
disappointment and indignation from the indigenous activist communities,
not to mention the thorny controversy over radioactive waste in Orchid
Island (or Lanyu), Taiwan's main nuclear dumpsite where the Tao
indigenous people reside. The story of the dark history of the Han
settlers and their continual suppression and exploitation of the
indigenous peoples of Taiwan from the seventeenth century to the present
is indeed a very long one.¶ [**Colonization for indigenous peoples in
Taiwan is** not a past tense, but rather **the present tense**. The
postcolonial discourse]{.underline}, to borrow Liao Ping-hui's words,
[can "only partially describe what constitutes the 'postcolonial'
condition in Taiwan,"]{.underline} 16 given its total neglect of
indigenous peoples. Postcolonialism, as New Zealand-based indigenous
scholar Linda Tuhiwai Smith succinctly argues, serves to a large extent
as "a strategy for reinscribing or reauthorizing the privileges of
non-indigenous academics because the field of ['post-colonial' discourse
has been defined in ways which can still leave out indigenous
peoples]{.underline}." 17 [This type of colonial situation whereby
settlers (superordinate migrants) displace the indigenous residents and
take over the land is what scholars have termed settler
colonialism.]{.underline}

Since its founding, the revolutionary ethos of the People's Republic of
China has been framed by discourses of liberation and a rhetoric of
anti-imperialist solidarity. The founding of the People's Republic stood
in opposition to a legacy of European and Japanese imperialism and the
entrenched inequalities of Qing and Republican-era modernism. Like the
Soviet Union, [**China** positioned itself as **a postcolonial
state**.]{.underline} But despite these claims and efforts by Maoist
leaders to promote multinational solidarity and guard against Han
chauvinism, the [**Han-dominated party-state** nevertheless inherited
and intensified control over the ancestral lands of the largest
non-Chinese speaking groups in the country, the Tibetans and the
Uyghurs. This **led to the establishment of a settler state in Inner
Asia during the Mao era, and**, as China transitioned into a central
node of global capitalism in the 1980s and 1990s, this Inner Asian
project has **evolved to include more and more of the features of an
internal settler colonialism.**]{.underline} At the same time, the
enduring legacy of **[Mao era "settler socialism,"]{.underline}** a term
that I borrow from the work of my colleague Grace H. Zhou,1 [has served
to further elide the contemporary autonomy and knowledge claims of
Uyghurs and other frontier peoples.]{.underline} ¶ **[The People's
Republic of China was founded on the imperial legacy of the late Qing
Empire.]{.underline}** While aspects of the early Qing empire were
conciliatory and coalition-focused toward Inner Asian peoples, the
[People's Republic]{.underline} also [**inherited** a more recent,
largely **Han-led**, Qing **legacy of mass violence** carried out by Zou
Zangtang's armies in the 1870s, a Confucian education-centered capture
of Turkic institutions, and the mass deportations and settlements of
both Turkic and Han people in the region. So as the national liberation
campaign was launched by the PRC in the 1950s with the goal of
indigenizing Communist Party state systems, administrative structures,
and adapting existing institutions such as schools, media, and communal
authority structures to promote the core values of the Party these,
often unacknowledged, legacies of expropriation and domination played a
role in the way Uyghurs were forced, at least in some instances, to
receive their liberation.]{.underline}¶ The defensive state building
politics of the new People's Republic also mitigated against Uyghur
autonomous liberation. A 1949 conversation between Joseph Stalin and
Chinese Communist vice chairman Liu Shaoqi, where Stalin describes the
need for Chinese to "occupy" Xinjiang in order to secure oil and cotton
resources for China in reaction to British imperialism is particularly
instructive in this regard. As Stalin put it:¶ One should not put off
occupation of Xinjiang, because a delay may lead to the interference by
the English in the affairs of Xinjiang. They can activate the Muslims,
including the Indian ones, to continue the civil war against the
communists, which is undesirable, for there are large deposits of oil
and cotton in Xinjiang, which China needs badly. The Chinese population
in Xinjiang does not exceed 5 percent, after taking Xinjiang one should
bring the percentage of the Chinese population to 30 percent by means of
resettling the Chinese for all-sided development of this huge and rich
region and for strengthening China's border protection. In general, in
the interests of strengthening the defense of China one should populate
all the border regions by the Chinese.¶ So while the People's Republic
did strive to institutionalize a Uyghur socialism, from the very
beginning, [the **resources of Uyghur and Kazakh ancestral lands** now
**belonged to the party-state** and were subordinated to the demands of
the majority-led revolution. As an archipelago of Han-led agricultural
and military colonies was established across the region in the 1950s the
settlement of those lands by decommissioned soldiers]{.underline} and
others established the occupation that Stalin invoked. By the end of the
decade, [many Uyghur and Kazakh carriers of traditional
knowledge]{.underline}---glossed as counterrevolutionary superstition,
or as "local nationalism"---[had been removed from positions of power in
community leadership and a new focus on Han-centric scientific
modernization came to the fore]{.underline}. This is the period in which
Uyghur "native" or yerlik knowledge, a term I will return to in the
second half of this essay, came to be conflated with a "backwardness" in
need of the "advanced" or scientific civilization of the Han majority. ¶
[The enduring presence of imperialist aspects in China's rule of Inner
Asia is what leads me and a number of other scholars committed to
decolonization and antiracism to think in parallel with Grace Zhou about
1950s to 1980s Xinjiang, Tibet, **Inner Mongolia and Central Asia as
spaces of settler socialism.**]{.underline} This framing, which I view
as both an acknowledgement of the unfulfilled promise of Maoist
revolution and an acknowledgment of the emergent occupation, domination
and dispossession brought about by the same process, is a way of naming
the particular forms of twentieth century Soviet and Chinese colonial
projects.¶ [**Settler socialism is** perhaps best understood as a type
of "subimperialism" or **subcolonialism**]{.underline} that responds to
what Natasha Kaul refers to as a "moral wound" of past colonization or
semi-colonization often narrated as a "century of humiliation" in
contemporary Chinese state-narrated history.
[Subcolonialism]{.underline}, what I take to mean the colonial actions
taken by the formerly colonized, [is **expressed**]{.underline} in this
case [**through the imposed development and intensified colonization of
China's Inner Asian frontier** (particularly during China's post-Mao
embrace of global capital) **and justified through the logic of the
wound.**]{.underline} This logic leads to the conclusion that because
China's body politic was so badly wounded by its experience with
colonialism, it's occupation, domination and dispossession of peripheral
peoples is not only justified but is itself an expression of
anti-imperialist care.

These [tactics of invasion and occupation can also be seen in the way
**250,000 Russians moved to Crimea after it was annexed in
2014**]{.underline}.¶ Academics sometimes **[refer to]{.underline}**
these tactics [**as "settler colonialism**."]{.underline} As a strategy
of subjugation, it has many historical precedents and [it provides an
important lens for understanding geopolitics in various parts of today's
world.]{.underline}¶ Two types of empire¶ History is studded with
empires. Broadly speaking, there are two types.¶ British rule in India
exemplifies an empire of control, where imperialists extract wealth and
resources without large-scale emigration from the colonizing country.
The importation of the wealth of India, especially its textiles, was an
essential requirement of Britain's Industrial Revolution.¶ There are
also [empires of settlement that occupy colonial territories by moving
in large numbers of settlers]{.underline}. Across the world, especially
in the lightly settled open grasslands of Australia and the Americas,
the original inhabitants were displaced and marginalized as their
homeland was taken by treaty, sale, guile and theft.¶ [The process often
**involved brute force or ethnic cleansing as land was seized** and
handed over to immigrants.]{.underline} In Australia, the British
justified colonization by declaring the continent "terra nullius" --
that is, empty and uninhabited.¶ **[Settler colonies were used to
safeguard the edges of empires.]{.underline}** A policy used by the Qing
dynasty (1644-1912) that moved ethnic Chinese settlers into recently
captured territory is still used today in Tibet and Xinjiang. [Both
imperial Russia and the former Soviet Union encouraged citizens to
settle border regions, so today at least 20% of the population of
Ukraine is ethnic Russian.]{.underline}¶ Settler colonialism¶ Many
settler empires rose in the 18th and 19th centuries and continued well
into the 20th century. In Africa, for example, settler societies were
established by the British in Kenya, the French in Algeria and the Dutch
in South Africa.¶ [The colonists who moved in]{.underline}, often in
large numbers, [were typically white Europeans who took control over the
land, lives and economy of Indigenous peoples.]{.underline} There were
exceptions, though. In Liberia, Black Americans settled in the land of
Black Africans; in Israel, mainly Jewish immigrants took over the land
of Arab populations; and in China, the majority Han people moved into
non-Han areas.¶ My research into the interactions between Indigenous
people and European settlers in North America and resistance to cultural
integration by an Indigenous art movement in central Australia has
offered me a different way to view history. Looking at the past through
a lens of settler colonialism substantially changes how we view
histories of many countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand,
South Africa and the U.S.¶ Today's issues, viewed through a colonial
lens¶ [Most settler societies are steeped in a prejudiced history in
which racial categories define who has power]{.underline}. One strategy
has been to make full citizenship available only to settlers and their
offspring. Some of the more extreme examples include racialized rule in
South Africa that created brutal apartheid and traumatized generations
of aboriginal Australians.¶ There is also a long history of child abuse,
with Indigenous children taken from their homes to be assimilated into
settler society. Emerging evidence of these practices, including those
experienced by Indigenous children in Canada's residential schools, is
helping to rewrite the history books from the Indigenous -- rather than
just from the settler -- perspective.¶ By restricting immigration, some
countries -- including Australia, Canada and the U.S., among others --
have tried to maintain their racial or ethnic identities and their
power. Many of these policies were weakened only in recent years.¶ But
in acts of amazing resilience, Indigenous societies have resisted
cultural assimilation, political marginalization and economic
insecurity.¶ [**Land is a key issue**, as Indigenous groups continue to
pursue land claims and resist land grabs]{.underline}. From ongoing
Mapuche claims in Chile to aboriginal Australians' successful campaign
to overturn the legality of "terra nullius," land seized by settlers is
being disputed.¶ [New facts and greater awareness of the racist nature
of settler societies are challenging the triumphalist view of progress.
New information is providing a darker understanding of the impact of
settler colonialism on Indigenous peoples, including ethnic genocide and
the devastating impacts of the loss of both land and cultural
identity.]{.underline}¶ [**This isn't just history**. Unequal, **brutal
treatment of settlers and indigenous peoples continues** in **today**'s
settler societies]{.underline}, not least of all [**in**]{.underline}
Xinjiang and in **[Ukraine]{.underline}**.

[Where does the myth that 'Crimea has always been Russia' come
from?]{.underline} How did the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union
'make' Crimea Russian? This dissertation shows how the [they applied
**settler colonial practices to Crimea**, displacing the indigenous
population and repopulating the peninsula with loyal settlers and how
Crimean settler colonial structures survived the fall of the Soviet
Union. It argues that this process defines post-Soviet history of the
peninsula.]{.underline}¶ For centuries Crimean existed within the
discourse of Russian imperial control. This dissertation challenges the
dominant view by [apply]{.underline}ing [settler colonial theory to
Crimea's past and present for the first time.]{.underline} This produces
two major scholarly contributions. Firstly, it broadens the geography of
[settler colonialism]{.underline}, demonstrating that it existed [not
only in Western European imperialism but also in Russia's imperial
project.]{.underline} Secondly, it [challenges the 'uniqueness' of
Russian imperialism]{.underline}.¶ The focus is on Crimea as a settler
colony during the first years after the USSR's collapse. The main
argument is that the [1990s conflict in Crimea was mainly around
decolonization attempts and resistance by the settler colonial
system]{.underline}. Contrary to the analysis of 'conflicts that did not
happen' it argues that [Crimea]{.underline} is a case of a
[conflict]{.underline} that [never stopped since the late 18th
century]{.underline}. It analyses how **[settler colonial structures
fought for their own preservation in opposition to the forces of
decolonization represented by the Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar national
movements]{.underline}**, maneuvering between the Russian and Ukrainian
capitals, which in turn triggered perceptions of Crimean separatism.¶ A
main theme is control over the narrative. Crimean [**settler colonial
institutions maintain**ed their **monopoly over** 'the **truth**' about
the peninsula's past and present.]{.underline} This dissertation
demonstrates how this continued in the 1990s, how Crimean newspapers
forged the meaning of 'Crimean,' redesigned boundaries of inclusion and
exclusion in order to marginalize Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar activists.
Another important issue is the role of hybrid institutions including
government structures in Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet, both which
conducted subversive operations (informational and military) to counter
and reduce the growing presence of the Ukrainian state on the
peninsula.¶ Summary for Lay Audience¶ The annexation of Crimea by the
Russian Federation in 2014 for many people was the first time they heard
about the existence of this peninsula. A region in the Eastern Europe
for most people of the West was too far away from their home to take the
conflict around it seriously. Meanwhile, [the claims of the Russian
authorities that Crimea is 'historically Russian' for many seemed like a
good enough justification for the annexation.]{.underline} As a result,
the first territorial annexation in Europe since the Second World War
received little to no active response from the world.¶ The purpose of
this study is to demonstrate that the [popular image of Crimea is a
result of the Russian and Soviet imperial policies.]{.underline} I argue
that [since the late 18th century Crimea has been a settler colony of
the Russian Empire, Soviet Union, and now -- Russian Federation. In
other words, the history of **Crimea is similar to** the history of
other **settler colonies of Western European empires.** Therefore, the
fact of settler colonization has to be at the basis of any analysis of
Crimean past and present.]{.underline} Through the analysis of the
political events in Crimea during the 1990s, this dissertation
demonstrates that **[the fall of the Soviet Union did not bring
decolonization to the peninsula.]{.underline}** Quite the contrary,
[local institutions fought to preserve the colonial status quo and
prolonged a conflict between the colonizers and the
colonized]{.underline}. In that fight, Russian state, a former
metropole, pretended to be a non-participant, but in fact actively
interfered into Crimean domestic politics.

its models of governance, values, and culture onto foreign lands under a
pretext that looks plausible to the elites and citizens of that state.¶
The pursuit of imperialist goals was not an uncommon practice in the
past. As we know, for example, Western European states expanded their
colonial reach to Latin America, Asia, and Africa. They portrayed
themselves as philanthropists who "brought civilization" to the
"underdeveloped" aboriginal communities---like Prometheus who gave fire
to people in need. This "civilizing initiative" usually took various
forms: propagation of the Christian religion, the dissemination of new
technology, and/or promotion of the principles of postEnlightenment
humanism. Later, by the mid-20th century Western European states
acknowledged that their Promethean activities had brutally distorted
aboriginal cultures and lifeways.\[1\] Thus, the citizens and elites of
these formerly imperial states declared imperialism to be a policy of
evildoing---the process of decolonization started.¶ [Russian
imperialism]{.underline}, on the other hand, [has never been properly
regarded as destructive or shameful]{.underline}. The pace and breadth
of expansion of the Tsardom of Muscovy (that evolved into the Russian
Empire under Peter I) into Asia were astounding. East of the Urals there
existed many indigenous territories that the authorities in Moscow
perceived as "poorly administered" and "isolated." [This perception
encouraged aggressive steps to fill the imaginary "power vacuum" with
centralized governance.]{.underline} According to Colin Gray, [every
single year from the mid-16th and to the late 17th century
Muscovy/Russia aggrandized itself by the land equivalent of the modern
territory of the Netherlands.]{.underline}\[2\] [These **150 years of**
almost **uninterrupted expansion, including the destruction of
indigenous** and local **cultures** have never been reckoned
with]{.underline}; no remorse has followed to match that of the former
empires in Western Europe. Alexander Morrison notes that migration to
new lands and frontiers has always been praised in Russian history,
while the negative impact of settler colonialism is fiercely
contested.\[3\] As a result, contemporary Russian elites---and the
citizens who legitimize these elites through voting---preserve an
outward-looking, assertive worldview. They are inclined, therefore, to
reproduce the expansionist patterns that had formerly led Russia to its
"greatness."¶ Unlike classical imperialism, which invented honourable
justifications for ruthless expansion, Russian neo-imperialism can be
said to be milder and more cautious. President [Putin]{.underline} and
his circle [aim to erect a "soft empire" by aggregating the
post-Communist republics]{.underline}, as Edward Lucas put it a few
years ago.\[4\] In other words, the [**Kremlin** strives to **influence
the governments of these republics to make them more
Russia-orientated**]{.underline} and/or Russia-obligated instead of
physically taking over the land that it deems appealing. To achieve
these objectives, [new tactics are being used, including media
brainwashing, cyber-breaches, election manipulation, religious
indoctrination, UN veto power, "green man" interventions]{.underline},
and many others. Citing former secretary of Ukraine's National Security
and Defence Council and finance minister Oleksandr Danylyuk, Russian
objectives entail in "the establishment of pro-Russian regimes in
satellite countries, followed by the violent suppression of attempts to
change political course, both at the level of the population and at the
level of elites. [**Rely**ing **on the threat of military force**,
Russia is actively using election fraud, coups, and even revolutions to
maintain control in such countries.]{.underline}"\[5\]¶ Another
distinctive feature of [Russian **neo-imperialist thinking resides in
the Kremlin's** very s**pecific framing of its foreign policy
objectives**]{.underline}. In its statements [the Kremlin emphasizes
Russian national interests and spheres of influence instead of
recognizing and respecting the sovereign choices of neighbouring states
and their right to national self-identification]{.underline}. This can
be seen in the constant demands by Putin and his circle that NATO stop
its enlargement---which it naturally perceives, given its own
proclivities, as an increase of America's "sphere of influence." The
self-evident argument that states themselves apply to join NATO, not
that NATO seeks to expand itself, seems to fall on deaf ears. The truth
is, furthermore, that NATO can hardly be defined as a catch-all and
open-to-everybody organization; it is quite a challenge for any
sovereign state to join NATO, requiring much political and social
dedication, deliberation, and sacrifices.¶ Similar observations can be
made about the Kremlin's protests in 2014 against Ukraine becoming an
Associate Member of the European Union---again, it was objecting to the
perceived increase of the EU's "sphere of influence." In the direct
aftermath of the Euromaidan, Russia demanded the renegotiation of the
Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement---a bilateral deal between
Ukraine and the EU---to accommodate its interests, i.e., the interests
of a third party. Finally, there is the whole Russkii Mir (Russian
World) concept, a [**unilateral attempt to expand the Kremlin's sphere
of influence** to all territories where "Russian \[serves\] as the
language of international relations and Russian culture as the shrine of
uniform values."]{.underline}\[6\]¶ In fact, many scholars have
described the neo-imperial thinking of Russian elites and citizens, but
under different guises. Alena Ledeneva presents it as an external
dimension to Putin's sistema,\[7\] Igor Gretskiy formulated an original
"Lukianov Doctrine" that a priori limits the sovereignty of Russia's
neighbouring states,\[8\] and Angela Stent recently introduced the
"**[Putin Doctrine]{.underline}**": "The core element...[is getting the
West to treat Russia as if it were the Soviet Union, a power to be
respected and feared, with special rights in its neighborhood and a
voice in every serious international matter]{.underline}. The doctrine
holds that only a few states should have this kind of authority, along
with complete sovereignty, and that [others must bow to their
wishes]{.underline}...And the doctrine is [**tied together by Putin's
overarching aim: reversing the consequences of the Soviet collapse,
splitting the transatlantic alliance, and renegotiating the geographic
settlement that ended the Cold War**.]{.underline}"\[9\]¶ Rather than
attributing any doctrinal approach to Putin himself, I prefer to label
contemporary [Russian foreign policy as neo-imperial]{.underline} for
two reasons. Firstly[, it repeats Russia's historical tradition of
expansion, one that proved successful in the past and led to the state's
"greatness."]{.underline} Secondly, [it has little to do with the figure
of Putin, who merely became the latest of many imperial-type leaders
coordinating Russian expansion]{.underline}. In other words, **[Putin
"filled the shoes" of the tradition]{.underline}**, found that [these
shoes fit Russia's current ambitions... and he seems to like walking in
them.]{.underline}¶ [Putin's justification for Russian
neo-imperialism]{.underline}¶ On 18 March 2014, on the eve of the
Russian invasion in the Donbas, Putin delivered a pivotal address to the
Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation.\[10\] This address entered
the history books as [the "Crimean speech"]{.underline} and
[unveiled]{.underline} some of [the cornerstones of the Kremlin's
neo-imperialist thinking about the world and Ukraine.]{.underline}¶
Primarily, [Putin declared that the **US and its allies** had
**undermine**d **the international order and** preferred to **follow the
"rule of the gun" instead of the rule of law.**]{.underline} Russia felt
humiliated and robbed every time the US ran amok, especially in Central
and Eastern Europe. That was not to be tolerated.¶ Secondly, Russian
interests had been systematically ignored since the downfall of the
USSR. [Putin believed that Western leaders were constantly cheating him
with their objectives and actions]{.underline} (i.e., NATO enlargement,
EU's enlargement, EU's Eastern Partnerships, and other
developments).\[11\] Moreover, they were continuing to pursue
"containment" policies regarding Russia and attempting, as Putin defined
it, "to sweep us into a corner because we have an independent
position."¶ Thirdly, [Putin underlined that no one should underestimate
Russia's resolve to take decisive actions]{.underline}: "Russia is an
independent, active participant in international affairs; like other
countries, it has its own national interests that need to be taken into
account and respected."¶ Fourthly, the downfall of the USSR was yet
again portrayed by Putin as the major geopolitical catastrophe of the
20th century. Because of that downfall, the world became US-led and,
thus, unstable and imbalanced.¶ Finally, [Putin blamed **international
institutions** and organizations for the failure to ensure global
security and order. He considered them to be mere tools and **agents
under the command of Western states.**]{.underline}

[Russian Settler Colonialism]{.underline}¶ While [migration to new lands
and frontiers is a dominant theme in Russian history, the existence of
settler colonialism]{.underline}1 in Russia is fiercely contested. This
chapter will argue that in the 19th century [**Imperial Russia developed
ideologies and practices of settler colonialism** which bore a clear
family resemblance to those of other European states and
peoples.]{.underline} It will concentrate primarily on [migration,
resettlement and colonization]{.underline} in Russia before the
revolutions of 1917 [and the establishment of the USSR]{.underline}.
While the movement of Russians into Siberia and the other republics of
the USSR continued throughout the Soviet period, this took place within
a high modernist nation-building framework quite alien to earlier
European colonial practice, which distinguishes it from the settler
colonialism of the Tsarist period.2 ¶ In the 1920s and 30s the first
generation of Bolshevik historians to write about the subject, some of
whom were Kazakhs or other non-Russians, had a licence to denounce
peasant colonization as one of the Tsarist regime's many exploitative
policies, publishing fierce critiques which explicitly compared Russian
settlement in Asia to other instances of European colonialism.3 By the
outbreak of the Second World War this could (and did) attract
accusations of 'bourgeois nationalism'.4 From the 1940s the very terms
['colonisation' and 'colonial' were deeply sensitive when applied to
Russia, implying as they did parallels with the policies of Western
imperialist powers who were the USSR's ideological enemies]{.underline}.
Soviet scholarship on the subject became largely confined to platitudes
on the 'progressive role' played by [Russian settlers]{.underline} in
[introducing the indigenous peoples of Siberia and the Steppe to
advanced agricultural techniques and Bolshevism, **descriptions of** the
**exploitation** of these regions **by Russian capitalist
entrepreneurs**, and explorations of the rise of 'class differentiation'
amongst the settlers]{.underline}.5¶ [The **narrative of** growing
**'friendship' between settlers and the indigenous populations** of
Central Asia and Siberia was always one of the least convincing aspects
of Soviet historiography, but it **has** had **a long afterlife in
modern Russia**]{.underline}. Even today, suggestions that Russian
colonisation policies had anything in common with those of the Western
Imperial powers can provoke extremely hostile reactions from Russian
scholars.6 Western historians, meanwhile, were largely restricted to the
use of published sources until 1991, and the cold war agenda of much
Western historical writing meant that it paid little attention to
agrarian resettlement in the Tsarist period.7 Twenty-five years on, we
now have a small but valuable body of publications based on archival
research which analyse this vital question of the history of Imperial
Russia in considerable depth and detail.8 Russian settlement in Siberia,
which had already all but erased many indigenous peoples and cultures
even before the heyday of settler expansion in the 'Anglo-World' in the
19th century, has probably attracted the most attention, with the work
of the late Anatoly Remnev standing out as the most important.9
Alexander Etkind has suggested that the history of Russian expansion is
best understood as a process of 'internal colonization' of different
peoples (including the Russians themselves) by a state that was equally
alien and remote to all, but this interpretation does not take into
account the significant **[differences]{.underline}** which had emerged
**[in the treatment of Russian and non-Russian peoples]{.underline}** by
the imperial state in the course of the 19th century -- differences
which [can be seen most clearly when examining Russian colonization in
Central Asia]{.underline}.10 Here Jeff Sahadeo has given us an excellent
account of urban settler society in Tashkent,11 and there are a number
of publications on Russian settlement on the Kazakh steppe,12 and in the
rural regions of southern Central Asia (Turkestan).13 Much has also been
written on colonization in Central Asia in Russian, notably an excellent
monograph and collection of documents from the Kazakh historian S. N.
Maltusynov.14 Unfortunately some of the other scholarship from
Kazakhstan takes a narrowly nationalist view of the question, and that
from Russia by and large continues to tip-toe round the more difficult
and sensitive questions of inter-ethnic relations, while the idea of
Russia's osobyi put' ('Special path' or Sonderweg) remains persistent.15
Nevertheless, even looking solely at English-language historiography,
there is now [enough published scholarship on Russian settler
colonialism to allow its integration into the wider narrative of
European colonial expansion and settlement]{.underline}.16

### Settler Colonialism K -- AT: Perm

#### Perm fails -- an effective decolonial movement must refuse any engagement with the state. The perm is a form of indigenous tokenization and assimilationist liberal pluralism which only serves to perpetuate colonialism by giving the state the power to select and force indigenous identities to fit into their existing colonial narrative

[North America's **state** and corporate wealth is]{.underline} largely
[**based on**]{.underline} the subsidies provided by [**the theft of
Indigenous lands and resources. Colonial conquest** was designed to
**ensure** forced displacement of Indigenous peoples from their
territories, **the destruction of autonomy and self-determination in
Indigenous self-governance,** and the assimilation of Indigenous
peoples' cultures and traditions.]{.underline} Given the devastating
cultural, spiritual, economic, linguistic, and political impacts on
Indigenous people, [any serious]{.underline} social or environmental
justice [movement must]{.underline} necessarily [include non-native
solidarity in the fight against colonization]{.underline}.¶
**[Decolonization]{.underline}** is as much a process as a goal. It
[**requires a profound re-centring of Indigenous worldviews**
in]{.underline} our [movements]{.underline} for political liberation,
social transformation, renewed cultural kinships, and the development of
an economic system that serves rather than threatens our collective life
on this planet. As stated by Toronto-based activist Syed Hussan
"Decolonization is a dramatic re-imagining of relationships with land,
people and the state. Much of this requires study, it requires
conversation, it is a practice, it is an unlearning."¶ It is a positive
sign that a growing number of social movements are recognizing that
[Indigenous self-determination must become the foundation for
all]{.underline} our broader [social-justice mobilizing. Indigenous
peoples are the most impacted by the pillage of lands, experience
disproportionate poverty and homelessness, are over-represented in
statistics of missing and murdered women, and are the primary targets of
repressive policing and prosecutions in the criminal injustice
system.]{.underline} Rather than being treated as a single issue within
a laundry list of demands, [Indigenous self-determination is
increasingly understood as intertwined with struggles against racism,
poverty, police violence, war and occupation, violence against women,
and environmental justice.]{.underline}¶ [Intersectional
approaches]{.underline} can, [however, subordinate and compartmentalize
Indigenous struggle within the machinery of existing Leftist
narratives]{.underline}: anarchists point to the anti-authoritarian
tendencies within Indigenous communities, environmentalists highlight
the connection to land that Indigenous communities have, anti-racists
subsume Indigenous people into the broader discourse about systemic
oppression, and women's organizations point to relentless violence borne
by Indigenous women in discussions about patriarchy.¶ We [have to **be
cautious to avoid replicating the state's assimilationist model of
liberal pluralism**, whereby Indigenous identities are forced to fit
within our existing groups and narratives.]{.underline} [The inherent
right to traditional lands and to self-determination]{.underline} is
expressed collectively and [should not be subsumed within the discourse
of individual or human rights]{.underline}. Furthermore, it is
imperative to understand being Indigenous as not just an identity but a
way of life, which is intricately connected to Indigenous people's
relationship to the land and all its inhabitants. Indigenous struggle
cannot simply be accommodated within other struggles; it demands
solidarity on its own terms.¶ The practice of solidarity¶ One of the
basic principles of Indigenous solidarity organizing is the notion of
taking leadership. According to this principle, [non-natives must be
accountable and responsive to the experiences, voices, needs, and
political perspectives of Indigenous people themselves]{.underline}.
From an anti-oppression perspective, meaningful support for Indigenous
struggles cannot be directed by non-natives. Taking leadership means
being humble and honouring frontline voices of resistance, as well as
offering tangible solidarity as needed and requested. Specifically, this
translates to taking initiative for self-education about the specific
histories of the lands we reside upon, organizing support with the clear
guidance and consent of an Indigenous community or group, building
long-term relationships of accountability, and never assuming or taking
for granted the personal and political trust that non-natives may earn
from Indigenous peoples over time.¶ In offering support to a specific
community in their struggle, [non-natives should organize with a mandate
from the community and an understanding of the parameters of the support
that is being sought.]{.underline} Once these guidelines are
established, non-natives should be pro-active in offering logistical,
fundraising, and campaign support. Clear lines of communication must be
maintained and a commitment made for long-term support. This means not
just being present for blockades or in moments of crisis, but instead,
activists should sustain a multiplicity of meaningful and diverse
relationships on an ongoing basis. Feminist writer bell hooks suggests,
"[Solidarity is not the same as support.]{.underline} To experience
solidarity, we must have a community of interests, shared beliefs and
goals around which to unite, to build Sisterhood. Support can be
occasional. It can be given and just as easily withdrawn. **[Solidarity
requires sustained, ongoing commitment]{.underline}**."¶ Organizing in
accordance with these principles is not always straightforward.
Respecting Indigenous leadership is not the same as waiting around to be
told what to do while you do nothing. "I am waiting to be told exactly
what to do" should not be an excuse for inaction, and seeking guidance
must be weighed against the possibility of further burdening Indigenous
people with questions. The appropriate line between being too
interventionist and being paralyzed will be aided by a willingness to
decentre oneself and by learning and acting from a place of
responsibility rather than guilt.¶ Cultivating an ethic of
responsibility begins with non-natives understanding ourselves as
beneficiaries of the illegal settlement of Indigenous people's land and
unjust appropriation of Indigenous peoples' resources and jurisdiction.
When faced with this truth it is common for activists to get stuck in
their feelings of guilt, which I would argue is a state of
self-absorption that actually upholds privilege. While guilt is often
representative of a much-needed shift in consciousness, in itself it
does nothing to motivate the responsibility necessary to actively
dismantle entrenched systems of oppression. In a movement-building
roundtable long-time Montreal activist Jaggi Singh expressed that
**["\[t\]he only way to escape complicity with settlement is active
opposition to it.]{.underline}** That only happens in the context of
on-the-ground, day-to-day organizing, and creating and cultivating the
spaces where we can begin dialogues and discussions as natives and
non-natives."¶ Alliances with Indigenous communities should be based on
shared values, principles, and analysis. For example during the
anti-Olympics campaign in 2010, activists chose not to align with the
Four Host First Nations, a pro-corporate body created in conjunction
with the Vancouver Olympics Organizing Committee. Instead, we took
leadership from and strengthened alliances with land defenders in the
Secwepemc and St'át'imc nations and Indigenous people being directly
impacted by homelessness and poverty in the Downtown Eastside. In
general, however, differences surrounding strategy within a community
should be for community members to discuss and resolve. We should be
cautious of a persistent dynamic where solidarity activists start to
fixate on the internal politics of an oppressed community. Allies should
avoid trying to intrude and interfere in struggles within and between a
community, which perpetuates the civilizing ideology of the White Man's
Burden and violates the basic principles of self-determination.¶
Building intentional alliances should also [**avoid** devolution into
**tokenization**. Non-natives often determine which Indigenous voices to
privilege by defaulting to the more "well-known, "easy to get ahold of"
or "less hostile" Indigenous activists.]{.underline} This selectivity
distorts the diversity present in Indigenous communities and can
exacerbate tensions and colonially-imposed divisions between Indigenous
peoples. In opposing the colonialism of the state and settler society,
[non-natives must recognize]{.underline} our own [role in perpetuating
colonialism within]{.underline} our [solidarity efforts.]{.underline} We
actively [counter this by theorizing and discussing the nuanced issues
of solidarity, leadership, strategy, and analysis not in abstraction but
within our real and informed and sustained relationships with Indigenous
peoples.]{.underline}¶ Decolonizing Relationships¶ While centring and
honouring Indigenous voices and leadership, the [obligation for
decolonization does rest on all of us]{.underline}. As written by Nora
Burke in Building a Canadian Decolonization Movement: Fighting the
Occupation at Home, "[A decolonisation movement cannot be comprised
solely of solidarity and support for Indigenous peoples' sovereignty and
self-determination. If we are in support of self-determination, we too
need to be self-determining. **It is time to cut the state out** of this
relationship, and to replace it with a new relationship, one which is
mutually negotiated, and premised on a core respect for autonomy and
freedom.]{.underline}"¶ Being responsible for decolonization often
requires us to locate ourselves within the context of colonization in
complicated ways -- often as simultaneously oppressed and complicit.
This is true, for example, for racialized migrants in Canada. Within the
anti-colonial migrant justice movement of No One Is Illegal, we go
beyond demanding citizenship rights for racialized migrants as that
would lend false legitimacy to a settler state. We challenge the
official state discourse of multiculturalism that undermines the
autonomy of Indigenous communities by granting and mediating rights
through the imposed structures of the state and seeks to assimilate
diversities into a singular Canadian identity. Indigenous feminist
Andrea Smith reminds us that "All non-Native peoples are promised the
ability to join in the colonial project of settling indigenous lands...
In all of these cases, we would check our aspirations against the
aspirations of other communities to ensure that our model of liberation
does not become the model of oppression for others." In B.C., immigrants
and refugees have participated in several delegations to Indigenous
blockades, while Indigenous communities have offered protection and
refuge for migrants facing deportation.¶ Decolonization is the process
whereby we intend the conditions we want to live and the social
relations we wish to have. **[We have to supplant the colonial logic of
the state itself.]{.underline}** German philosopher Gustav Landauer
wrote almost a hundred years ago that "[the State is a condition, a
certain relationship between human beings, a mode of behaviour; we
destroy it by contracting other relationships]{.underline}."
**[Decolonization]{.underline}** requires us to exercise our
sovereignties differently and to reconfigure our communities based on
shared experiences, ideals, and visions. Almost all Indigenous
formulations of sovereignty -- such as the Two Row Wampum agreement of
peace, friendship, and respect between the Haudenosaunee nations and
settlers -- are premised on revolutionary notions of respectful
coexistence and stewardship of the land, which **[goes far beyond any
Western liberal democratic ideal.]{.underline}**

We are organizing against the FTAA in solidarity with indigenous people
of the Americas, both north and South. [No one has been as screwed over,
exploited, and generally scammed as the indigenous people of the
Americas. They've had their land stolen, the treaties they signed were
broken before the ink was dry, and they've been pushed onto ever smaller
"reservations."]{.underline} (Let's not forget that Canada's reservation
system was the blueprint for apartheid in South Africa.) [Their land has
been raped for commodities, their children were sent to government run
residential schools in a effort to destroy their culture, and they have
had outright war and genocide inflicted upon them.]{.underline}¶ [The
history of indigenous people is also one of incredible and inspiring
resistance]{.underline}, however. [Indigenous people have fought back,
from the Red River rebellion to Pine Ridge, from Kanesatake to Gustafson
Lake, from Stoney Point to the Zapatistas in Chiapas, who kick-started
the fight-back against the neo-liberal agenda in 1994 when the North
American Free Trade Agreement first came into effect.]{.underline} The
movements against global capitalism have a lot to learn from indigenous
resistance movements, and we damn well better be in solidarity with them
and their struggles, too.¶ [We have learned]{.underline} in anti-racist
and anti-fascist organizing [to **ask nothing from the
state**]{.underline}. The state will not stop nazis; it uses and
protects them. **[The state cannot be depended on]{.underline}** to
write "social contracts" on labor or the environment into international
"agreements" on trade, let alone to enforce such protections. [**The
state's primary purpose** in the capitalist system **is to** subsidize
and **protect large corporations interests while
attacking**]{.underline} the working class and **[indigenous resistance
movements]{.underline}** opposing those interests. This is exemplified
by the massive mobilization of the state's police forces for The Summit
of the Americas in Quebec City, which has been called the "largest
security operation ever undertaken in Canada". The same thing was seen
last June in Windsor for the demonstrations against the Organization of
American States which initiated the FTAA process. **[To put any faith in
the state would be putting faith in one of the most powerful forces
directly opposing our calls for]{.underline}** labour rights,
environmental protection, **[indigenous
self-determination]{.underline}**, open immigration and an end to
capitalism itself.
