Russian Revisionist Strategy on the Rise]{.underline}?", DOI:

The better we understand why Russia intends to increase its geopolitical
and geostrategic position and role in the regional arena, the better we
can realize why and how [[the **Russian revisionist policy has been
developing since** ]{.mark}**20[08]{.mark}**]{.underline}, from Europe
to the Middle East, via the Caucasus region. Since 2008: a) [Russia
prevented NATO's expansionist policy through the [wars in Georgia,
Crimea and Ukraine. Russia returned]{.mark} stridently [to the
international arena]{.mark}]{.underline}; b)
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[consolidated its position as
a]{.mark} leading and [dominant power in]{.mark} the [Caucasus]{.mark}
region]{.underline}; c) It [[took action in the Middle East and]{.mark}
defended its strategic interests in [Syria]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Moscow uses all the necessary factors available to realize its
revisionist strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such factors are:

(1) [[Military strength]{.mark}. The first level is that of a preventive
    strategy. The second is that of the Russian aim to consolidate its
    strategy either with force]{.underline}---as occurred in the cases
    of Georgia, Crimea, Syria and Ukraine---or in the shadow of its
    power.

(2) [[Gas and oil]{.mark}. Russia uses the pipelines like 'energy
    divisions' to serve its interests and increase its political
    influence]{.underline} over states and governments.

(3) [[Tech]{.mark}nology. Russia combined conventional and cyber
    techniques and tactics in the wars that it led from
    2008]{.underline}. Its conventional military forces include
    sophisticated weapons such as the missile systems of S-300 and S-400
    and the hypersonic missiles (3M22 Zircon) that combined with its
    extended cyberwar capabilities provide Russia with the chance to
    attenuate the advantage that the US holds in the sea due to its
    tremendous war fleet power. 41

(4) [Historical and [imperial Russian
    consciousness]{.mark}]{.underline}.42 [Moscow has an imperial
    identity and consciousness, military power, national resources and a
    pivotal geopolitical position in the core of the
    Heartland]{.underline}. By combining these factors, Moscow fuels its
    political machine to accomplish its strategic missions and targets.

(5) [[Russian minorities]{.mark} existing in other states are used by
    the Kremlin as strategic instruments to achieve its national goals.
    This phenomenon is evident in the cases of Crimea and Ukraine.
    **Minorities also [exist in the Baltic States]{.mark}** [and other
    countries]{.mark}]{.underline}, which emerged in the regional system
    after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Therefore, [this specific
    issue of minorities takes wider and more complicated
    dimensions]{.underline}. It is also relevant to political and legal
    motives and the right to self-determination, the exercise of which
    depends on conflicting and convergent national interests of the
    parties involved as well as the uniqueness of each case. Moreover,
    humanity experienced tragic implications when Adolf Hitler exploited
    the Sudeten Germans as a strategic instrument to occupy
    Czechoslovakia paving the way for the Second World War. It is not a
    new strategic practice. Therefore, history repeats itself because
    the feeling of national integration cannot be easily suppressed.

**[The [lack of an adequate]{.mark} European and American [preventive
strategy is a quasi-ally of Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[which]{.mark} pursues to [restructure the international system and
promote]{.mark} its [revisionist strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
American and European expansionist policy offered Russia the pretext to
put forward a preventive and then a revisionist policy in Georgia,
Crimea, Syria and Ukraine. Moscow seized the opportunity to make its
case by accusing the US and NATO of following an aggressive strategy
that put Russian security at stake. [While [Russia argues that it is in
defence]{.mark}, at the same time, [it promotes its
revisionist]{.mark}]{.underline}, even belligerent [[strategy]{.mark},
which partially induces a redistribution of power and the restructuring
of the]{.underline} regional and [international system in line with its
hegemonic strategic goals]{.underline}.43 Whether this policy will be
successful and to what extent, is something that only time can show.
**[[The War on Ukraine seems to be a cornerstone for the future
structural changes in Europe and worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Russia pursues to raise itself as a game-changer]{.underline}. The
relevant question is the following: What structural changes the
Russo-Ukrainian War could bring about?

States Agency for International Development, 02-17-2022. "Putin's New
Russia: Fragile State or Revisionist Power?"

Putin has positioned himself and Russia as a culturally and religiously
conservative alternative to western secular liberal democracies. This
world view is described in Project Russia which is a curious, if
alarming, collection of essays published in five-volumes as a semi-
official government publication that describes the political ideology of
the State, the Orthodox Church's religious vision, geographic
determinism, and social analysis shared by Putin and his circle of
oligarchs who rule Russia. These essays form a strange amalgam of
anti-democratic, reactionary, ultra-nationalist attacks on western
democratic values, combined with an unhealthy dose of conspiracy
theories, paranoia, xenophobia, and a defense of autocratic government
and dictatorship.18 One view of Project Russia is that its publication
simply reflects Putin's understanding as a former KGB agent that a great
power must have an ideology to defeat and undermine its rivals in
propaganda battles. But a more sinister and alarming view is that the
five volumes are Putin's blue print for Russia's grand strategy,
evidence of a revisionist power seeking to overthrow the existing
international order. If this interpretation of Project Russia is
correct, it suggests a greater level of future conflict with the western
democracies and international institutions. If Project Russia is a blue
print and not just a propaganda tool, the risk of an accidental global
conflagration between Russia and the NATO alliance is a real, even if
less than likely, possibility.

Vladimir Putin must find ways of explaining to the Russian people why
the country is so far behind the western democracies, as did his
predecessors in the Soviet Union. Putin continues to pursue the Soviet
strategy of keeping the memory of World War II alive to stir up Russian
nationalism among the population but also as an explanation for Russia's
underdevelopment. The evidence suggests that this strategy faces
increasing hurdles. Russia's epic and very real sacrifices during World
War II no longer have much resonance with the younger generation, who
know little about the war, and the older generation, who tire of a war
70 years ago being used to explain Russian inability to match Western
living standards today. Thus, what had been a powerful historical
experience of collective suffering and sacrifice during World War II,
has now become a fading memory which lacks the magnetic power it held
over the Russian people during the Cold War.19

Undoubtedly, one of the motivations behind Putin's attempt to regain
Russia's lost stature in the world, expand its sphere of influence,
attack western democratic institutions, and annex the territory of its
neighbors is driven by a need to avenge the supposed "secret conspiracy"
among the Western democracies to collapse of the Soviet empire and
humiliate Mother Russia.20 The Russian electronic media and Project
Russia continue to propagate this and other conspiracy theories. The
Russian government's arming of the Taliban, reported by U.S.
intelligence sources and by CNN, may be a response to U.S. military
intervention in Syria against the Assad Government, an ally of Russia,
but it could also be payback for the CIA's arming of the Mujahideen
fighting against the Russian military in Afghanistan during the
1980's.21 Some in the Reagan Administration saws the arming of the
Mujahideen as U.S. payback for Soviet support for North Vietnam during
the Vietnam War.

Some of the history of the Cold War certainly involved the arming of
U.S. and Russian client states against each other, but after the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 U.S. policy changed to one of
facilitating the integration of Russia into the international system and
its conversion into a democratic capitalist system. Both the U.S. and
Europe spent billions of aid dollars in programs in Russia from 1991 to
2012 to support these political and economic reforms. If they intended
to destroy Russia, why would they have made these large investments? It
is also the case that President George H.W. Bush went to great lengths
to avoid dancing on the grave of the Soviet empire as it collapsed in
order to avoid giving fodder to Mikhail Gorbachev's critics.

#### \*Russia revisionist.

**Malmgren 6-3** \[Harald Malmgren, 6-3-2022, \"Putin\'s war is just
beginning\", UnHerd,
https://unherd.com/2022/06/putins-war-is-just-beginning/, DOA: 7-2-2022
//ArchanSen\]

Putin talked at length about the historic tragedy of the collapse of the
Soviet Union, but also added that the Soviet Bloc was the wrong model
for what Russia needed. He made an impassioned explanation that what
Russia really needed was a new Peter the Great. He talked almost
lovingly about Peter's attempts to upgrade Russia's institutions and
education system from 1682 to 1725. He argued that after the total
collapse of the USSR, it had become necessary to rebuild a Greater
Russia under the leadership of a new version of Peter.

Peter, he told me, had set in motion the magnificent strengthening of
Russia completed by Catherine the Great: the establishment of
Novorossiya, or Imperial Russia, spanning all of the Baltic Sea, the
Nordics and Poland, as well as the peoples and nations to the west and
to the south to the Azov and Black Sea. He then made it clear he did not
think the Soviet Bloc was the right model to achieve this, and what he
longed for was a return of Imperial Russia, not Soviet Russia.

Reflecting on this early interaction with this clearly ambitious young
man, I was reminded of Putin's path from being Deputy Mayor of St
Petersburg to serving under President Yeltsin in Moscow. In 1996 Yeltsin
asked the Mayor of St. Petersburg, Professor Sobchak, to come to Moscow
and lead the drafting of a new Constitution for the new Republic of
Russia. Sobchak asked his protégé, Putin, to come along.

In Moscow, Yevgeny Primakov, Yeltsin's Prime Minister, had been known
for years as "the Soviet Union's Kissinger". I had known him since the
Eighties. It was he who first introduced me to Putin in 1992 as a man
likely to be important in Russia's future. Primakov initially appointed
Putin as head of the FSB, but soon after asked him to take on the more
comprehensive role of Secretary of the State Security Council,
effectively placing him in charge of shaping the new Russian Republic's
foreign policy. It was said at the time that Primakov's proposal filled
Putin with a noticeable ecstasy, that fate had gifted him with the
opportunity to live his dream of reshaping Russian history.

Never one to shy away from an opportunity, Putin immersed himself in
every aspect of Russia's standing in the world. He did, however, pay
particular attention to the potential for nuclear weapons to intimidate
other nations. He published a new doctrine of nuclear threats, known as
"Escalate to Deescalate". The public airing of this doctrine was meant
to show that he was seriously considering selective use of nuclear
weapons not only inside Ukraine but in future conflicts with Baltic Sea
neighbours.

By 1999, the time had come for Yeltsin to step down. A new constitution
had been approved, and Russia was ready for a new leader. Several
candidates appeared, but Sobchak, father of the constitution, and Putin,
the man designated to deal with foreign leaders, emerged as favourites.
I recently asked people who were there at the time how the competition
was resolved, and was told Sobchak made the choice. He said he was an
academic, but not a man who would be good at managing a nation. He
admitted he thought "Vlad" was a man of action, just what Russia needed
at that moment. So Putin was appointed Prime Minister, and four months
later elected President.

This elevation was extraordinary. To Putin, who dreamed of a return to
Imperial Russia, it must have felt like fate had chosen him to be a
second incarnation of Peter the Great --- a 21st-century Tsar, or even
Emperor. This self-perception may well have led him to embrace Xi
Jinping, the other self-perceived 21st-century Emperor.

[[Despite]{.mark} the Kremlin's heavy losses in invading [Ukraine, the
Russians are "going to come back stronger" in a **year**]{.mark} or so
[to threaten the Baltics]{.mark}]{.underline}, Estonian Ministry of
Defence Permanent Secretary said on Thursday.

Speaking at a Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessment event, Kusti
Salm said that [[even given Moscow's]{.mark} rising [number of
casualties,]{.mark} destruction of armored forces and depletion of
precision-guided weapons, [the Kremlin can still mass fires as it is
showing]{.mark} in fighting [in]{.mark} eastern and southern
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}.

He called NATO's "trip-wire" strategy and even its "forward presence" in
limited numbers obsolete in light of Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of
Ukraine.

Because [[the Baltic]{.mark} nation[s]{.mark} [are on Russian borders
and small, they could be **quickly overwhelmed**]{.mark} in a full-scale
Russian invasion]{.underline}.

"Deterrence by denial," Salm said Wednesday, cannot be achieved by a
battalion of NATO troops in his country or any other Baltic member of
the alliance. [[He called it "a joke" that "the **second largest nuclear
nation would be deterred by a battalion**]{.mark}." The presence "has to
be at the divisional level" to "be able to project power across the
Russian border."]{.underline}

[Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, the Baltic
states]{.underline} of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania [have been calling
for]{.underline} their region to receive [the biggest build-up of
combat-ready NATO forces in Europe since the end of the Cold
War,]{.underline} to be agreed at a summit on June 28-30 in Madrid.

**[It will not happen]{.underline}**, interviews with seven senior
diplomats and officials from leading NATO allies show.

This is partly because [the proposals come as the NATO alliance faces a
slew of demands not seen in decades: from countering Russia and China in
the Arctic to quelling Islamic insurgencies in the Sahel, and tackling
new frontiers in space.]{.underline}

Since Russia invaded, [the U.S. Congress has approved extra funds and
the Pentagon sent F-35 stealth fighters, as well as attack helicopters,
to Estonia; Britain doubled its force presence at Estonia\'s Tapa
military base to around 1,700 personnel.]{.underline}

But for many people in the region, which has been occupied by both
Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany and which lies within striking distance
of a Russian garrison at St. Petersburg, [that is not
enough]{.underline}. For instance, [84.6% of Latvian
respondents]{.underline} to a Benu Aptiekas/Gemius poll in May [said
they were highly anxious about Russia\'s invasion]{.underline}.

\"**[The fact that we could be in danger, it\'s been on the table all
the time]{.underline}**,\" said Dzintra Bungs, 82, head of the Latvian
Occupation Museum Association in Riga. \"[It is very important that we
have woken up, and that all Europe awakes.\"]{.underline}

The Baltics, with a combined population of just over six million, want
the alliance to boost its pre-Ukraine invasion presence of around 5,000
multinational soldiers by as much as tenfold, as well as adding air and
maritime defences.

On Sunday, [NATO Secretary-General]{.underline} Jens Stoltenberg [said
"nobody knows" how long the Russian war in Ukraine might
last]{.underline}, but, he added, "we need to be prepared for it to last
years." Retired Army General Jack Keane told a Fox & Friends audience on
Monday that [Ukraine]{.underline} had the ability, will, and troops to
win the war. All they [lacked]{.underline}, he claimed, "is [the
weapons]{.underline} to do it."

**[The historical record and a growing mountain of evidence, however,
suggest that such claims are unrealistically optimistic]{.underline}**,
as [there is a growing possibility that the Ukrainian Army may be months
away from losing the ability to defend the country.]{.underline}

If the two sides do not end the war through negotiations in the coming
months, [it is likely]{.underline} -- not just possible -- [that Ukraine
will lose the war]{.underline}.

[It is time to strip off the rose-colored glasses]{.underline} much of
[the West has worn when looking at Russia's war of
aggression]{.underline} against Ukraine and acknowledge the cold, hard
truth: [the Russians are on course to win. The longer we traffic in the
fiction that Ukraine still has a chance, the more Ukrainian civilians
will be killed]{.underline}, the more cities will be destroyed, [and the
higher the probability that Russia seizes yet more
territory]{.underline} before a negotiated settlement can end the
fighting -- potentially including Kyiv. You'd never know that, however,

[The most advanced weapons that the United States has so far supplied
Ukraine are making an impact in their first several days]{.underline} on
the battlefield, destroying Russian ammunition depots and command
centers, American and Ukrainian officials say.

[Ukraine's military had eagerly awaited the arrival of the first batch
of]{.underline} truck-mounted, multiple-rocket launchers, whose
**[[satellite-guided rockets]{.underline}]{.mark}** have a range of more
than 40 miles, [**[greater than anything Ukraine had
possessed]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [The weapons have even won **grudging
respect from some Russians** for their accuracy and power]{.underline},
analysts said.

Still, [[only **four of the launchers**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} called
High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems or HIMARS, and their U.S.-trained
crews [[are in the fight, though **four more** are expected]{.mark} this
month. [Ukrainian officials say **they need**]{.mark} **as many as
[300]{.mark} multiple-rocket launchers** [to combat
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is firing several times as many
rounds as Ukraine's forces in the artillery-driven war of attrition in
the country's east.

[Ukrainian soldiers are using their new weapon judiciously, firing one
or two guided rockets]{.underline} at ammunition depots or command
posts, often [at night]{.underline}, and keeping them well away from the
front lines to protect them, Pentagon officials and military analysts
say.

"[So far [they seem to be a quite useful addition]{.mark}]{.underline},"
Rob Lee, a Russian military specialist at the Foreign Policy Research
Institute in Philadelphia and a former U.S. Marine officer, said of the
systems. "[[They will]{.mark} help [hinder]{.mark} further
[Russia]{.mark}n advances, [but]{.mark} **they [won't]{.mark}
necessarily [mean Ukraine will]{.mark} be able to [take back
territory]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

The HIMARS are the centerpiece of a raft of new Western long-range
weapons that the outgunned Ukrainian military is switching over to as
its arsenal of Soviet-era howitzer and rocket ammunition dwindles.

The [Western weapons are more accurate and highly mobile]{.underline},
but it takes weeks to deploy them from the United States and Europe and
to train soldiers to use them. In the meantime, Russia's military is
making slow but methodical gains in the eastern region of Donbas, where
both sides have taken heavy losses.

The Biden administration says that **[[all eight]{.mark} HIMARS [should
be in Ukraine by]{.mark} mid-[July]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The first
group of 60 Ukrainian soldiers trained to use them are now firing the
guided rockets in battle, and a second group is undergoing training in
Germany. [[Britain and Germany]{.mark} have [each pledged three]{.mark}
similar multiple-rocket [launchers]{.mark}]{.underline}.

A senior Pentagon official said this week that the [Ukrainians appear to
be employing the HIMARS with **deadly effectiveness**]{.underline} and
that the four additional systems would be deployed in "the near future."

[At a NATO summit in Madrid [on **Thursday**]{.mark},]{.underline}
President [[Biden promised \$800 million more in security
assistance]{.mark} to Ukraine,]{.underline} including more ammunition
for the HIMARS. The United States has committed nearly \$7 billion in
military aid since the war started in February.

Since Russia focused its campaign on the east after failing to seize
Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, and other cities in the north, [Ukrainian
officials have pleaded with United States and other allies for more
advanced artillery]{.underline}.

On June 23, Ukraine's defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, announced that
the first American HIMARS had arrived, promising in a Twitter message,
"Summer will be hot for russian occupiers. And the last one for some of
them."

Two days later, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the top commander of Ukrainian
forces, posted a video on the social media site Telegram of the HIMARS
in use. "Artillerymen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine skillfully hit
certain targets --- the enemyʼs military facilities on our Ukrainian
territory," he said.

American officials said the Ukrainian statements were accurate, and Mr.
Lee added that even Russian accounts acknowledged the HIMARS to be early
successes.

"[In general, it seems they respect them and realize they're quite
capable]{.underline}," said Mr. Lee, citing a popular Russian Telegram
channel whose posts are shared by Russian defense accounts.

Sharapov: **[[The party that will win]{.mark} in this war [will be the
party that will first start using]{.mark} contemporary [high precision
equipment]{.mark}]{.underline}** and weapon systems. And those drones
that you mentioned, [[they are a part of]{.mark} the modernized, highly
accurate, highly precise, **[modern equipment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It
gives us an advantage that allows us to accurately strike the enemy.

Gen. Karpenko: Regarding the first question, I want to add something to
what the deputy minister has said in terms of the need for equipment and
armaments. [I just want you to understand the intensity of the
conflict.]{.underline} While the deputy minister was talking, I drafted
some numbers to just show you the intensity of combat along those ...
kilometers where the combat is most active.

Think about this: [[one brigade occupies]{.mark} around [40
kilometers]{.mark} of the fence line. That means that to cover the
active combat conflict [we need 40 brigades. Every brigade is 100
infantry]{.mark} fighting [vehicles, 30 tanks, 54 artillery
systems]{.mark} --- just for one brigade, and we have 40 of
them.]{.underline}

I\'m not going to talk about the anti-tank guided missiles or anti-tank
guided weapons for now. I'm just talking about heavy weapons. As of
today, [[we have]{.underline}]{.mark} approximately 30 to 40, sometimes
up to [[50 percent of losses]{.mark} of equipment as a result of active
combat]{.underline}. So, we have lost approximately 50 percent. ...
[[Approximately 1,300 infantry]{.mark} fighting [vehicles]{.mark} have
been lost, [400 tanks, 700 artillery systems]{.mark}.]{.underline}

That is a mathematical estimation we can make based on the length of the
frontline and the intensity of the conflict. So, I\'m giving you this
estimate just for you to understand how significant the requirement is
based on the intensity of the conflict.

So, think about it. [If the current need for artillery systems is [700
vehicles]{.mark}, that [needs to be replenished]{.mark} because they
were destroyed. And [we have only received 100]{.mark}
vehicles]{.underline} for example from \[foreign\] aid. ... Then there
\[are\] medical needs, the air force troops, the special forces and all
the other branches and services that are also fighting in this war.

Regarding the heavy armaments and in regard to the drones as you asked
about: this is what the war has come down to --- using heavy artillery
systems. It\'s close-contact warfare. So that leads to a lot of
casualties.

The war that we are seeing in Ukraine right now happened the last time
in 1945 when the world won over evil.

Unfortunately, today, [[we don\'t have the tech]{.mark}nologies [that
would allow us to limit]{.mark} human [casualties]{.mark}. We have close
human contact within the warfare. And that\'s why the deputy minister
said correctly that [the **victorious side will be the party that

Rebekah Koffler, born in the Soviet Union and a former intelligence
officer for the US government, is the author of Putin\'s Playbook. She
says [[Putin would \"**absolutely**\" use a nuclear
weapon]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[\"This]{.mark} type of [conflict is exactly the type of situation for
which Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}, on his orders, [the so-called nuclear
warfare doctrine [was developed]{.mark} that is called **[\'escalate to
de-escalate]{.mark}**]{.underline},\'\" Koffler said. [\"[You]{.mark}
are [escalat]{.mark}ing [by **popping a nuke** in a conventional
conflict]{.mark}, in order to de-escalate the conflict. [A]{.mark}
tactical [nuc]{.mark}lear warhead [could be detonated on]{.mark} the
territory, in this case of [Ukraine]{.mark}, in order [to dislodge the
opponent]{.mark} psychologically.]{.underline} If Russian intelligence
services assess accurately or by mistake that the U.S. and NATO are
about to intervene, Putin would preemptively activate that doctrine.\"

Koffler says [[Putin believes he has the upper hand because of
his]{.mark} large [arsenal of]{.mark} tactical [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, which usually are small nukes intended to
destroy battlefield targets rather than whole regions.

\"Russia holds the advantage in tactical nukes, a one to 10 ratio,\"
Koffler said. \"We have 200, the Russians have 2,000. So this is exactly
why he\'s prepared to use that instrument if he has to.\"

Some have speculated that if Putin orders a nuclear strike, his staff
might disobey his order, triggering a coup. Koffler says that won\'t
happen.

\"This is such Western and American-style thinking. **[[Nobody is going
to refuse Putin\'s orders]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Remember, [we\'re
talking about the person]{.underline} (Putin) [who has authorized
multiple assassinations]{.underline},\" Koffler said.

#### A Russian nuke would make escalation inevitable -- regardless of what NATO does.

Assuming the United States, NATO, and Ukraine could agree on any action,
there are several possibilities. If the Russian attack caused little
damage, NATO might first try to issue an ultimatum with the aim of
reaching a settlement on the Alliance's and Ukraine's terms. But [[if
Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} had [[convinced himself]{.mark} that [there
was no other option but to strike, he would be unlikely to acquiesce
to]{.mark} any allied proposals for]{.underline} such [a
[settlement]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, [[a non-nuclear]{.mark}
military [response]{.mark}]{.underline} (for example, conventional
strikes on military bases and infrastructure in Russian territory that
are supporting the invasion) [[would]{.mark} probably not [be]{.mark}
decisive and would appear [inadequate]{.mark} to many---[in addition
to]{.mark} carrying its own risks of
**[escalation]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[That leaves the option]{.underline}]{.mark}, for which NATO forces are
fully adequate, [[of **a strike tailored to the scale and character** of
the Russian one]{.mark}. Some would understandably argue that continuing
to defend Ukraine is simply not worth risking a [**nuclear
escalation**.]{.mark}]{.underline} But while it is easy to see the risks
of a nuclear counterstrike, [[there are]{.mark} also serious
[implications of not doing it:]{.mark} The absence of a US nuclear
response would gravely [weaken the credibility]{.mark} among both
friends and adversaries of the entire strategy of deterring nuclear
attack through the prospect of US nuclear retaliation.
[This]{.mark}]{.underline}, in turn, [[would make a **bigger war more
likely**]{.underline}]{.mark}. May we never need to face the choice.

#### Nuke war causes extinction.

President Joe [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} and top subordinates have
[[refused to]{.mark} publicly [acknowledge]{.mark} the danger of
[nuc]{.mark}lear [war --- **even though it is**]{.mark} **now [higher
than]{.mark} at [any other time]{.mark} in at least 60

policy of denial makes grassroots activism all the more vital for human
survival.

In the aftermath of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, President John F.
[Kennedy was more candid.]{.underline} Speaking at American University,
he said: "**[[A single nuc]{.mark}lear weapon [contains]{.mark} almost
[10 times the explosive force]{.mark} delivered by [all the allied air
forces in the Second World War]{.mark}]{.underline}**[."]{.mark} Kennedy
also noted, "[[The deadly poisons]{.mark} produced by a nuclear exchange
[would be carried by wind]{.mark} and water and soil and seed [to the
far corners of the globe]{.mark} and to generations yet
unborn.]{.underline}" Finally, he added, "**[[All we have built]{.mark},
all we have worked for, [would be destroyed in]{.mark} the first 24
[hours]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

Kennedy was no dove. He affirmed willingness to use nuclear weapons. But
his speech offered some essential honesty about nuclear war --- and the
need to seriously negotiate with the Kremlin in the interests of
averting planetary incineration --- an approach sorely lacking from the
United States government today.

[At the time of Kennedy's presidency, nuclear war would have been
indescribably catastrophic. [Now]{.mark} --- [with]{.mark} large

### 1AC\-\--Turkey Alliance Good

#### Turkey is good for NATO -- shields NATO, prevents anti-Islam bias, decreases RCA, terror, NATO military capability, influence. 

**THO nd** \[THO Contributors, xx-xx-xxxx, \"Turkey's NATO membership is
an asset for both Turkey and the Alliance\", Turkey's NATO membership is
an asset for both Turkey and the Alliance,

DOA: 7-2-2022 //ArchanSen\]

Just as Turkey derives immense benefits from [NATO]{.underline}
membership, the alliance in general and the United States in particular
also [benefit from Turkey\'s membership. First]{.underline}, since its
entry to the alliance [Turkey]{.underline} has played a key role in
European security by [shielding the continent from the east and the
south. Turkey does not only act as a buffer zone insulating
the]{.underline} Kantian [Europe from the]{.underline} Hobbesian [Middle
East but also]{.underline} as a [spearhead enabling NATO allies to reach
out to the Caucasus, Black Sea, Central Asia and wider Middle
East]{.underline}. During the Cold War Turkey acted as a bulwark against
Soviet penetration into the wider Middle East and helped lessen the
Soviet military pressure on central Europe by tying up sizable Soviet
troops. Turkey\'s role as an unsinkable aircraft carrier has been well
noted.

[Second, Turkey is the only ally within NATO which has a Muslim-majority
population. Turkey\'s membership serves as an antidote to the claims
that NATO is an alliance of Christian nations]{.underline}. This has
become more and more important in the post-9/11 era, as civilizational
and identity-related considerations have increasingly colored
international politics. [For NATO\'s military operations across the
globe not to be seen as biased against Islamic nations, Turkey\'s
presence inside the alliance has been vitally important.]{.underline}

[Third]{.underline}, if the Biden administration is sincere about
revitalizing the rules-based international order and committed to
strengthening NATO as a bulwark against Russia and China, [securing
Turkey's cooperation within NATO would be decisive. Turkey is too
important an ally to lose to the Russian-Chinese axis.]{.underline}

[Fourth]{.underline}, as NATO\'s current Secretary General has
underlined many times, [Turkey\'s cooperation within NATO has been vital
to the defeat of radical religious terrorism]{.underline} in the wider
Middle East. Besides, Turkey is home to millions of refugees who would
like to otherwise go to European countries. [Fifth, having the second
largest army within the alliance and participated in almost all NATO
military operations to date, Turkey has decisively contributed to
NATO\'s overall military capabilities.]{.underline} Turkey\'s
participation in multinational NATO operations in Afghanistan and taking
command of it numerous times speak volumes in this regard. Turkey
hosting the upcoming negotiations between the Afghan government and
Taliban could potentially facilitate the peace process. [Sixth,
Turkey\'s membership in NATO provides western countries with important
opportunities to have an influence on Turkey\'s international and
internal policies/orientation as well.]{.underline} Why to lose this
prerogative by pushing Turkey further away from the alliance?

### 2AC\-\--A2: Humiliation Turn

#### Crushing Russia is good -- the squo is the worst of all worlds -- future Russian attacks, China invades Taiwan, collapse of the LIO, and middle power attacks.

**Mongrenier 6-10** \[Jean-Sylvestre Mongrenier, Professor of History
and Geography and researcher at the French Institute of Geopolitics,
6-10-2022, \"Why do we Want Ukraine to Win?\", Desk & Russie,
https://en.desk-russie.eu/2022/06/10/why-do-we-want-ukraine-to-win.html,
DOA: 7-2-2022 //ArchanSen\]

The political-media system is prone to cyclothymia. After having feared
the collapse of Ukraine in the days following the Russian offensive of
February 24, the resistance and the affirmation of a "nation in arms"
gave rise to the greatest optimism. The question now was how far to
support the Ukrainian counter-offensive. **[[Shouldn't]{.mark} Vladimir
[Putin]{.mark}'s Russia [be spared "humiliation"]{.mark} by offering it
a "way out"?]{.underline}** Even if it means rewarding the aggressor,
humiliating the aggressed and sanctifying ethnic cleansing with bombs?

[It is]{.underline} first of all [a question of]{.underline} principle
and of [the prevalence of the general norms of law]{.underline}: the
sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability of the borders of a
national state fully recognized on the international scene and a member
of the UN since its foundation! An independent state since the
dissolution of the USSR, a decision not imposed by the West but desired
by the Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian presidents at the time. The
Ukrainian borders were recognized by Russia itself. Let us recall the
signing of the Budapest Memorandum (1994) and the Russian-Ukrainian
friendship treaty (1997). On a general level, the Helsinki Final Act
(1975) excludes the modification of borders by force, a principle taken
up in the Charter of Paris (1990), which marked the end of the Cold War.

[[Turning a blind eye to]{.mark} such [a violation of the law]{.mark},
in the name of "pragmatism]{.underline}", i.e. of a cynical attitude,
**[[would stimulate]{.mark} the geopolitical revisionism and historical
[revanchism of the]{.mark} master of the [Kremlin]{.mark} and the
Chekist structure that serves him]{.underline}**. [[After a strategic
pause]{.underline}]{.mark}, necessary to digest its territorial gains,
[reconstitute its forces and play in the interstices of the Western
front, [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, driven by the cult of power
(derjavnost), [**[would]{.mark} set out [again]{.mark} to [attack the
borders of Europe]{.mark}**. In the meantime, [a]{.mark}n intensified
"[**hybrid war**" would have tested the resistance]{.mark} in Northern
Europe, on the borders of the Baltic States and Poland as well as in the
Black Sea basin.]{.underline}

It is necessary to underline here the youth and fragility of the
geopolitical structure of Europe, an "old continent" whose borders date
back only to the 20th century. It would be easy for one or the other
state to write a historical dissertation and to exhibit maps of the past
to justify claims and coups de force. In short, the running gag about
Francis Fukuyama, less read than quoted, the disillusioned talk about
the revenge of History and the resignation in front of the fait accompli
would announce the return to the happy warmongering and without borders
of other times.

The end of peace in Europe and [[the **collapse of the international
order**]{.mark} which]{.underline}, for all that, [[contained the
aggressiveness of the revisionist powers, would have repercussions on a
global scale]{.underline}]{.mark}. As an ally and supporter of
Russia-Eurasia, the Chinese Communist Party-State and its "little
helmsman", [**[Xi]{.mark} Jinping, [would be encouraged]{.mark} in their
enterprise [to destroy]{.mark} Western [heg]{.mark}emony**. [The
pressure on]{.mark} the [Taiwan]{.mark} Strait]{.underline}, the islands
and archipelagos of the "Asian Mediterranean" (South and East China
Seas) [[would be accentuated]{.underline}]{.mark}. Not to mention [the
Himalayan borders of the Indian Union. In the wake of Sino-Russian
Eurasia, small and [medium]{.mark}-sized "[troublemakers]{.mark}" [would
be tempted]{.mark}.]{.underline}

For all these reasons, **[the West must show moral
clarity]{.underline}**, unity of purpose [and resolve in its support for
Ukraine]{.underline}. Notwithstanding game theory and clever
developments on the gradation of retaliation, interspersed with appeals
for peace, it must be understood that [Putin wants to take
Ukraine]{.underline}, no longer at once but in tranches,
[and]{.underline} that [he will destroy what he cannot
conquer]{.underline}. His armies and his police machine will advance
until they are stopped. He himself sees himself at war with the
"collective West", which brings us back to the great political lesson of
Julien Freund: "It is not I who designate the enemy, it is he who
designates me as such". It is as simple as that.

So there is no real and honorable alternative to the victory of Ukraine.
One can already hear the false metaphysical questions about the meaning
of such a term: what is victory in the 21st century? Is not the war
dead? Doesn't everything just flow? On the pretext that nothing is
eternal here below, the sophists dismiss the being and withdraw into the
domain of representations. Let us simply refer to the definition that
the Larousse gives of victory: "Favourable outcome of a battle, of a
war". "Opposites: debacle -- rout -- discomfiture -- rout". More or
less, this corresponds to what strategists call the "desired end state",
assuming that one does not seek defeat.

The question remains as to the terms of a Ukrainian victory in the
present war. The outcome of the battle of Kiev has already prevented the
worst: the collapse of the Ukrainian state. The battle of Kharkiv has
shown the ability to conduct local counter-offensives. In the Don River
basin, resisting the bombardments and stopping the advance of Russian
units on the ground would be other successes. Further deliveries of
Western weapons will contribute to this (see the forthcoming delivery of
US multiple rocket launchers).

The situation in the Don River Basin cannot overshadow that in southern
Ukraine. Of course, the front line is hardly moving and Mykolaiv has not
fallen. Nevertheless, the territories conquered to the north of the
Crimean peninsula are important, and Ukraine is deprived of part of its
coastline. As for the port of Odessa, it is the object of a naval
blockade which asphyxiates Ukraine and paralyses all movement in the
Black Sea, at the risk of the world food balance.

In this part of the territory, the most important thing is to free
Odessa, a port without which Ukraine would become a geographically
landlocked state, deprived of access to the "greater Mediterranean"
(including the Black Sea) and thus to the World Ocean. As things stand
and for fear of a rise to extremes, a naval operation by NATO or a
Western coalition to force the blockade seems hardly conceivable.

Failing that, the possibility of an international fleet under the UN
flag, with a mandate voted by the UN General Assembly, is being
considered. From a diplomatic point of view, such a project could allow
a certain number of emerging and non-aligned countries, which have
cautiously stayed away from votes condemning the Russian action, to
"come on board". From an operational point of view, one has to have
doubts: is the Russian will to power inhibited by the colors of the UN?
Come on!

Another response would be to deploy coastal batteries and long-range
anti-ship missiles on the Ukrainian coast and along the Black Sea coast,
in order to keep Russian ships at bay. Grain ships could evacuate grain
from the port of Odessa to the Turkish Straits and the Mediterranean
Sea. Let us not forget, however, that Russia has very long-range strike
capabilities.

Let's summarize. To hold on to the Don River basin, the geohistorical
border of Europe since Antiquity, and to preserve the opening of Ukraine
to the Black Sea; to maintain the existing Western diplomatic front on
the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity, including
Donbass and Crimea: these are the terms of a Ukrainian victory, keeping
in mind that this war is part of a much larger conflict.

It is in this perspective that Ukraine should be integrated into the
Euro-Atlantic bodies: the European Union and NATO. In fact, simple
membership in the former, a commonwealth rather than a commonwill, would
not be enough in terms of defense and security. If this were the case,
would Finland and Sweden be knocking on NATO's door? The comparative
advantage of NATO is explained by the hegemonic leadership of the United
States and the means it mobilizes for the defense of Europe.

Those who clumsily refer to the "peace camp" (a sad reminder of Soviet
propaganda) will object that we have to live with Russia, which implies
that we must give priority to diplomacy. Sophism. Putin is not a
"man-of-effect" who would be satisfied with reacting to "man-causes"
(the West): he wants to conquer territories formerly under
Russian-Soviet domination and claims to assert his domination over
Europe. "Concessions" and "compromises" will encourage him to move
forward. In reality, diplomacy is governed by the balance of power on
the ground.

In short, [[submissive behavior will not save us]{.mark} from danger. It
is important to understand that [the Russian threat]{.mark} to Europe
[cannot be explained by a misunderstanding]{.mark}]{.underline},
regrettable blunders or a technical-institutional problem. **[[This
threat is structural]{.underline}]{.mark}** [--- it is a geopolitical
fact that the **policy of [appeasement of the last fifteen years has not
been able to modify]{.mark}** --- and it must be countered.]{.underline}

[Peace by force]{.underline}, therefore, in the order of the flesh, not
evangelical peace and the eschatology of the last ends, [which are of a
different order]{.underline}. To realize this and to change our mental
maps accordingly would be a great victory. [It would mean breaking out
of the impolitic behavior that Western governments have been indulging
in for too long.]{.underline}

Kahn took comfort in his conclusion that "[[irrationality is a matter of

[**subordinates are likely to step in**."]{.mark}]{.underline}

make it clear that an adversary doesn\'t have to be perfectly rational
to be understood and his actions anticipated. [Sensible actors may have
goals that are anathema to our own, but they pursue them in ways that
appear likely to attain those objectives]{.underline}. They also may
commit human errors. But even Morgan acknowledged that not every
opponent will be "sensible" enough to respect a deterrent threat.

### 2AC\-\--A2: NATO Withdraw

#### NATO prevents existential risks -- solves terror and both Russia and China.

This week, leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the
longest enduring alliance in history, will gather in Madrid for their
annual summit. Yet, [despite its longevity and success]{.underline} ---
or perhaps because of it --- many [[people]{.mark} question NATO's
relevance today, even as Russia occupies 20 percent of]{.underline}
Ukraine and threatens other European states. **[Others [have called for
the U.S. to withdraw from NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**, preferring an
isolationist approach to global conflicts. [[These attitudes are]{.mark}
misguided and [dangerous]{.mark}]{.underline}. NATO is not only still
relevant to the United States and the other members, it's necessary, and
here is why.

NATO came to the aid of the United States following the 9/11 attacks.
Many Americans fail to realize that NATO invoked Article 5 (an attack on
one is akin to an attack on all) and provided airborne warning and
control systems (AWACS) to help assist in monitoring aerial activity
over the United States. This support helped protect the U.S. against a
possible second wave of attacks. This was the first and only time
Article 5 was enacted and built upon alliance activity in which the
United States and other NATO members were involved during the 1990s and
included the likes of peace-keeping operations in Bosnia, Kosovo and
North Macedonia.

[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} has also been and [[remains a key pillar in
the fight against]{.underline}]{.mark} the Islamic State of Iraq and
Syria ([[ISIS]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[with its]{.mark} support of the
[Global Coalition]{.mark} to Defeat ISIS. As [we have seen transnational
terror]{.mark} organizations [become]{.mark} even [more violent and
extreme]{.mark}, ISIS has presented a significant challenge to Europe
and the United States [with attacks in **Belgium**, **Germany**,
**France** and the **U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates**]{.underline}
to name a few. As of just two months ago, the NATO Secretary General
Jens Stoltenberg underscored the alliance's provision of AWACS to
monitor ISIS activity.

Fast forward to today: [[NATO]{.mark} countries, with]{.underline} their
[[contribution of weapons]{.mark} and training [to Ukrain]{.mark}ian
forces, and their solidarity in standing up to Russia have been a
testament to the resolve of NATO and further underpins its
importance]{.underline}. Moscow failed to anticipate the strong and
coordinated NATO response. [[Educating Ukrain]{.mark}ian [military
personnel]{.mark} on NATO standards has [made a difference]{.mark} on
the battlefield in Ukraine. Russia through its aggressive behavior has
made [NATO]{.mark} reinvent its purpose, to **[deter Russia from
expanding]{.mark}**]{.underline}. NATO has provided command and control
of enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) battle groups in Eastern Europe as of
late to hedge against Russian aggression. NATO has learned from its time
in Afghanistan regarding effective communications, interoperability and
building on its combat experience there.

Accordingly, there are four multinational battle groups stationed in
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland; France has also contributed
troops to Romania. Russia has been employing hybrid warfare in Ukraine
and has through the Feb. 24 invasion forced its return to the world
stage as a significant power. Moscow punches above its weight class with
its small economic size comparable to Spain, relying more on its nuclear
forces while seeing its military conventional strength weakening in
Ukraine. NATO's presence in the Baltics and Poland sends a clear signal
that it will not tolerate aggression against alliance members. These
forces are also provided by European states, thus spreading the burden
of security beyond the United States.

Given the shifting geopolitical landscape, [NATO allies would be better
served by using the summit as a means to strengthen their
purpose]{.underline}, rather than pulling back. Allowing Finland and
Sweden to join the alliance, unanimously confirming support of Ukraine,
and perhaps most important for the United States, [embracing
[NATO's]{.mark} new Strategic [Concept]{.mark}, which will
[include]{.mark} security [issues stemming from **China**]{.mark}, would
[send a strong message]{.mark} to other would-be aggressors, [that NATO
is alive]{.mark} and well.]{.underline}

on]{.mark}]{.underline}** economic [**[security]{.underline}**
[via]{.underline}]{.mark} [their effect **on US defense
[manufacturing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Because weapon systems tend to
stay in]{.underline} [the US military inventory for so
long]{.underline}, [they]{.underline} often **[require spare
parts]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} [maintenance]{.underline} years
after the initial production run is complete. [DOD needs to pay the
overhead cost of maintaining the production capacity for
those]{.underline} spare parts, even when the production rate for spares
is much slower than the initial production rate during original
manufacture of the defense system. [[That]{.mark} slower [rate]{.mark}
tends to [drive the unit cost]{.mark} of spare]{.underline}
[parts]{.underline} **[dramatically [upward]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
some cases, demand for spare parts drops below the minimum technical
sustaining rate, meaning that the workers lose the ability to maintain
quality standards even when the buyer is willing to pay very high unit
costs. In other cases, [[the government does not realize how]{.mark}
much the [cost]{.mark} of production [has risen]{.mark} over time **[and
does not invest enough to keep the supplier]{.mark}
interested**]{.underline} [or [able to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[produce
the part]{.mark} profitably]{.underline}**, [[so production **drops
below**]{.mark} **the [minimum]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}**[economic sustaining rate]{.underline}**[.
[These]{.underline}]{.mark} [situations [create]{.mark}]{.underline}
potentially **[very [costly Diminishing Manufacturing Sources]{.mark} or
Material Shortage]{.underline}** (DMSMS)
**[[problems]{.underline}]{.mark}**.20 [[Arms exports]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} the expanded [demand]{.mark} for]{.underline} [future
spare]{.underline} [parts business that they create **can help
[reduce]{.mark} the unit [cost of spares]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[production by keeping up production rates, maintaining workers'
skills]{.underline}, [and [ameliorating]{.mark} the risk of [DMSMS by
**bolstering revenue for critical**]{.mark} **and fragile [niches in
the]{.mark} [supply chain]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [These effects have
been observed]{.underline} in recent years [in export sales of M-1
Abrams tanks and M-2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, among others.
Assessing these manufacturing effects of arms sales]{.underline}
[requires **detailed knowledge**]{.underline} [of the **defense supply
chain**]{.underline}, [including the **technical characteristics** of
the components that suppliers make, the financial status of each of
those suppliers, and the business strategy of the executives at each
supplier]{.underline}---**[knowledge that is not often available to the
government or defense industry prime contractors.]{.underline}**
Finally, [[CATs]{.mark} can **[contribute economic
benefits]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to the United States [through]{.mark}
the **[economies of scale]{.mark}**]{.underline} that are often
available in defense systems production. [If foreign sales are figured
into the cost estimates]{.underline} from the start of a project, and
[foreign buyers contribute to development and capital investment
spending, the cost of a project to the US defense budget]{.underline}
**[will be proportionately reduced, benefiting US economic
security.]{.underline}** For example, [the F-35]{.underline} program
claims to have [benefited from this dynamic]{.underline}, although the
higher overhead cost of managing a multinational development program and
the redundancies of building extra final assembly and sustainment
facilities overseas cut against the economies of scale benefits.21 [In
some European multinational aircraft development programs, governments
have presumed that programs would gain very large benefits from
economies of scale that have not materialized.]{.underline} This is [due
to technical and management challenges in the programs or the countries'
**failure to follow through on their initial purchase
commitments.**]{.underline} The result in those cases was that including
projected economy of scale benefits of foreign sales in a program's
management baseline added to rather than reduced program instability
**[and hurt economic security]{.underline}**.22 Estimating the net
economic effect of expected economies of scale as part of a CAT decision
would require sophisticated, reliable understanding of program dynamics
that might be beyond what the US government should reasonably count on
in its decision making. Overall, the new economic assessment in the [CAT
policy could meaningfully consider [two]{.mark} separate types of
economic [benefits]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that]{.underline}]{.mark}
might [**[derive from arms sales:]{.mark}** first]{.underline},
**[[macroeconomic]{.mark} [effects]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially
**[[via]{.underline}]{.mark}** effects on [**[employment]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} second, **[[microeconomic]{.mark} effects [on
specific firms and products]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [such as funding for
component upgrades and prevention of DMSMS challenges]{.underline}. The
methods for assessing these two types of effects would likely differ,
and each would present its own challenges to the data collection and
analysis process.

### 1AC\-\--Lockheed Scenario

Lockheed Martin (LMT) closed the most recent trading day at \$418.89,
moving -0.43% from the previous trading session. This change lagged the
S&P 500\'s 0.07% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.27%,
and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.02%.

Coming into today, shares of the aerospace and defense company had lost
4.41% in the past month. In that same time, the Aerospace sector lost
3.69%, while the S&P 500 lost 7.99%.

Investors will be hoping for strength from Lockheed Martin as it
approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Lockheed Martin is
projected to report earnings of \$6.41 per share, which would represent
a year-over-year decline of 10.1%. Our most recent consensus estimate is
calling for quarterly revenue of \$16.25 billion, down 4.6% from the
year-ago period.

LMT\'s full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of
\$26.84 per share and revenue of \$66.15 billion. These results would
represent year-over-year changes of +18.6% and -1.33%, respectively.

It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for
Lockheed Martin. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term
business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst
optimism about the company\'s business and profitability.

**[[Hypersonic]{.mark} technology]{.underline}** \-- weapons and
interceptors able to travel at least five times the speed of sound \--
[[are]{.mark} **a [top]{.mark} Pentagon [priority]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and an area [[where China and Russia]{.mark} are perceived to be [ahead
of U.S.]{.mark} **military [efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Defense
Department has committed to spend aggressively to catch up. Based on
initial contract awards, [it\'s]{.underline} becoming
**[clear]{.underline}** that [[Lockheed Martin]{.underline}]{.mark}
(NYSE:LMT) [[is **outpacing**]{.mark} the [competition]{.mark} in the
battle [to win]{.mark} **the [lion\'s share]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
those awards. Lockheed Martin earlier this month was awarded a \$480
million contract to develop a hypersonic air-launched, rapid response
weapon (ARRW). The award could be worth as much as \$780 million over
five years, assuming the company is authorized to move into low-rate
initial production. Lockheed beat out Boeing (NYSE:BA), Raytheon
(NYSE:RTN), and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) for the award. [It\'s the
**second major hypersonic win**]{.underline} for Lockheed Martin in
recent months, following a \$928 million award back in April to develop
a separate hypersonic conventional strike weapon (HCSW). Lockheed has
also been working with NASA since 2014 to create a hypersonic version of
its SR-72 spy plane, an award worth \$892 million, and is developing a
high-speed commercial prototype. The Air Force views the HCSW approach
as using existing technologies that have not been integrated for
air-launched hypersonic weapons, while the ARRW approach is focused on
developing new technologies. [A clear leader If the awards
offer]{.underline} the [impression]{.underline} that [Lockheed Martin is
out **ahead of its rivals** in hypersonic development, the
[commentary]{.mark} accompanying the decision [leaves **little
doubt**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a \"justification and approval\"
document announcing the latest contract, [military officials
said]{.underline} that [**Lockheed alone** is already **far
along**]{.underline} in developing the air-launched booster and ordnance
subsystems necessary for the ARRW program, [adding]{.underline} that
[\"[Lockheed]{.mark} Martin has]{.underline} also [already [overcome
**industrywide**]{.mark} **staffing
[challenges]{.mark}**[.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} In short, [[\"no
other]{.mark} contractor [has this]{.mark} **level of design
[maturity]{.mark}**[,\"]{.mark}]{.underline} according to the document.
The government concluded it would have had to absorb up to \$118 million
in duplicate development costs had it selected a company other than
Lockheed Martin. Secretary of the Air Force Heather A. Wilson, in a
statement announcing the latest award, made it clear that contractor
readiness is an important factor. \"We are going to go fast and leverage
the best technology available to get hypersonic capability to the
warfighter as soon as possible,\" Wilson said. Is there time to catch
up? All is not lost for the other contractors. Northrop, for example, is
a subcontractor on the Lockheed Martin Tactical Boost Glide program that
is now part of the ARRW. And while the exact size of the potential
opportunity for the industry is not yet known, these awards that
Lockheed Martin has won are likely to be just the beginning. The fiscal
2018 omnibus spending bill passed by Congress included more than \$16
billion for munitions, about \$2 billion more than requested, and fiscal
2019 spending will rise to \$20 billion. Only a fraction of that is for
hypersonic research and development. But with Russia claiming to have
already deployed a hypersonic system, and China said to be nearing that
point, it seems like a mini arms race has begun. It\'s likely the
Pentagon will do what it can to make sure the domestic hypersonic
competition does not become a one-horse race. Military officials in the
documentation supporting the ARRW award said that \"potential
competition may become available\" as other contracts are awarded in
hypersonics, suggesting that there are still opportunities for Northrop,
Raytheon, and Boeing to get involved. More than just the F-35 Regardless
of whether others catch up, hypersonics should go a long way toward
making a bull case for shares of Lockheed Martin. [[Hypersonics are part
of a **broader**]{.mark} **missile and missile-defense
[operation]{.mark}** [that is]{.mark} developing into **[a]{.mark}
powerful [second leg]{.mark}** for the company. Its growth]{.underline}
should help counter fears over the company\'s reliance on the
[[F-35]{.underline}]{.mark} Joint Strike Fighter, which [**currently
[accounts]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}]{.underline} about **[[30% of]{.mark}
total company [revenue]{.mark}]{.underline}** and is only [now beginning
to ramp toward **maturity**]{.underline}. Lockheed Martin\'s THAAD
anti-ballistic-missile system is the deterrent of choice for the United
States and its allies for dealing with potential hostile ballistic
launches from North Korea and elsewhere. Lockheed also was recently
awarded up to \$2.9 billion to develop and begin manufacturing a fleet
of infrared satellites to replace an existing system put in place to
provide early detection and warning. The company\'s second-quarter
results came in ahead of expectations in part because, [the
[company]{.mark}]{.underline} says, it [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
currently [[winning]{.mark} a **lot [more competitions]{.mark}**
[than]{.mark} it]{.underline} had **[[forecast]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
During the conference call to discuss results, management said that some
of those wins were in classified areas, which likely include a healthy
amount of missile and missile defense work. [Combine [missiles]{.mark}
with the [F-35]{.mark}]{.underline} ramp [and add in]{.underline} other
opportunities \--including the potential for increased sales from its
[[Sikorsky]{.mark} helicopter unit, an [F-22]{.mark} update,
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} even [continued interest in the aging
[F-16]{.mark} \-- and it\'s clear [Lockheed]{.mark} Martin [is]{.mark}
working on [a **powerful arsenal**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its shares
aren\'t cheap, up more than 50% over the past three years and trading at
a defense-high 35 times earnings. But it increasingly appears the
company\'s operations have the growth potential needed to justify its
share price. [[Expect shares]{.mark} of Lockheed Martin [to maintain

[China, the US, and Russia are]{.underline} each [striving to be **[the
first]{.mark} nation** to develop hypersonic systems]{.underline}:
aircraft and missiles that can cruise and maneuver at five times the
speed of sound (Mach 5) or faster. [The winner]{.underline} of this
technology contest [[will have **daunting**]{.mark} **military
[advantages]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Such weapons promise the ability to
hit targets from very long ranges, yet with such speed and surprise that
[defending against them is **extremely difficult**]{.underline}.
Hypersonic weapons could give those that possess them tactical
capabilities with potentially strategic effects. [Its]{.underline}
potential **[disruptive effect on military
operations]{.underline}**---the ability to fly at a mile a second at
Mach 5---[is]{.underline} most often [compared to that of **stealth and
precision weapons** when those]{.underline} technologies [appeared in
the 1980s]{.underline}. The consensus view is that [China]{.underline},
so far, [is winning]{.underline} the hypersonics race, largely [through
**financial brute force**]{.underline}. USAF Gen. Paul J. Selva, vice
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in January that China has
made hypersonics research "a national program"---a kind of Manhattan
Project---and it is "willing to spend ... up to hundreds of billions to
solve the problems of hypersonic flight, hypersonic target designation
and then, ultimately, engagement." Chinese state media announced in
March, for example, that China is building a 265-meter long wind tunnel
to simulate the environment from Mach 10 to Mach 25, which is to be
complete by 2020. It already has tunnels capable of simulating
conditions between Mach 5 to 9. Though the US has hypersonic tunnels,
most are quite small, for tests lasting less than a few seconds. Russia,
meanwhile, announced in March that it is testing the "Kinzhal" missile,
which president Vladimir Putin boasted can fly at Mach 10, has a range
beyond 2,000 kilometers, can carry conventional or nuclear warheads, and
can defeat any existing "or prospective" air defense system. Although
many leading US technologists scoffed at the claim, US Strategic Command
chief Gen. John E. Hyten confirmed to reporters at a Colorado space
conference in April that both China and Russia are flight-testing
hypersonic concepts, saying "you should believe Vladimir Putin about
everything he said he's working on." While Hyten said it's a "different
issue" as to whether those systems are deployed, "we ... listen to what
they say very closely, and none of what he did ... \[or\] said surprised
me." TORTOISE AND THE HARE [The [US]{.mark} is believed to
have]{.underline} had **[a commanding [lead]{.mark}]{.underline}**
toward fielding hypersonic systems [[until]{.underline}]{.mark} about
**[[five years ago]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In 2013, the X-51 program,
building on several previous projects, achieved more than 200 seconds of
air-breathing Mach 5 flight, proving it could be done. The program then
concluded and wasn't immediately followed up. A number of US successor
programs were either terminated for budgetary reasons or cancelled for
experiencing failures, even though the technology is in many ways still
in its infancy. Pentagon and congressional leaders in the last two years
have decried the risk-averse defense acquisition culture that favors
only "sure things" instead of gambling on chancy but potentially
high-payoff research. Most hypersonic research follows one of two main
avenues. One leads to a "boost-glide" vehicle in which an aerodynamic
shape is mounted on a rocket and accelerated to hypersonic speed. The
vehicle then detaches and coasts to its target, able to maneuver but
gradually bleeding off its energy as it flies. The other main approach
aims for an air-breathing vehicle also propelled to hypersonic speed by
a rocket, but then an internal supersonic combustion ramjet---or
scramjet---takes over. The vehicle separates from the rocket and propels
itself through the atmosphere, taking in air to mix with and burn
internal fuel and creating thrust, but without the rotors and
compressors of a turbine engine. Complex shaping of the inlet, exhaust
and combustion chamber, along with highly precise holes, ducts, and
bypasses is necessary to make this approach work. Underlying
technologies for hypersonics include advanced computers that can
calculate shapes and airflow, additive or 3-D manufacturing that can
make the exotic shapes necessary for the inlets and ducting, and
materials---metals and ceramics---that can withstand the extreme
temperatures and pressures of hypersonic flight. There will also need to
be guidance mechanisms that can function under those same stresses
without being crushed or melted. [**Leading US technologists**
believe]{.underline} either the boost-glide or air-breathing
[[approaches will yield]{.mark} **operational missile [systems]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} **under [five years]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and more test
flights akin to the X-51---possibly secret---are forecast to take place
this year. A more advanced concept, generally considered 10 years away
or more, would make use of a "combined cycle engine" approach. The
objective vehicle would take off from a runway, accelerate through Mach
1, achieve hypersonic speed, carry out a mission---spying, show of
force, or delivering weapons---and return to base for reuse. This goal
is challenging because the qualities that make for an efficient engine
in the subsonic and transonic regimes simply won't work in the
hypersonic regime, because of the different way that air behaves at
those speeds. Meanwhile, China is plowing ahead. The Pentagon's new
research and engineering czar, Michael D. Griffin, said in March that
China has made 20 times as many hypersonic technology tests as the US
has in the last five years. Speaking at a McAleese/Credit Suisse defense
conference just days after taking the top Pentagon R&E job,
[[Griffin]{.underline}]{.mark}, the former head of NASA, [[said]{.mark}
the [US must demonstrate]{.mark} **its [resolve]{.mark}** [to **lead in
hypersonics**. If]{.mark} the [Chinese are
**unchallenged**]{.mark}]{.underline} in this area, [[they]{.mark} could
"hold at [risk]{.mark} **our carrier battle groups ... \[and\] [our
entire]{.mark} surface fleet**,"]{.underline} Griffin warned. ["They
hold **at risk** our forward-deployed forces and land-based
[forces]{.mark}."]{.underline} Lacking either a defense or an ability to
respond in-kind, [the US faces **poor choices**. ["Our]{.mark} **only
[response]{.mark}** [is]{.mark}]{.underline} either to [let
them]{.underline} have their way, [or [**go
nuclear**."]{.mark}]{.underline} And that, he said, is "an unacceptable
situation for the United States." [[Hypersonic]{.mark} technology,
Griffin declared, [is]{.mark} his ["**No. 1
priority**."]{.mark}]{.underline} In a discussion at the Hudson
Institute in April, Griffin said there are ways [to defend]{.underline}
against hypersonics, but [there's only **a brief window**]{.underline}
for doing so. Such missiles "are relatively fragile during their long
phase of cruise flight" and are "fairly easy to destabilize," Griffin
noted. They also glow brightly in the infrared, because of the heat they
generate, and "yes, they can maneuver, but they can't maneuver in their
cruise phase as easily as an interceptor." [DEAD MEAT]{.underline}
However, ["if you let \[hypersonic weapons\] get into terminal
phase]{.underline}, where we've observed that they can pull many G's,
then [that becomes a hard target,"]{.underline} Griffin allowed. ["If
you allow an attacking vehicle]{.underline} to get close enough [to
begin its terminal dive]{.underline} ...and \[that\] might be from
100,000 feet ... [you're]{.underline} probably [dead meat because that's
a very hard intercept]{.underline} problem... [at that
point."]{.underline} He noted that [hypersonic weapons "overfly our air
defense systems and underfly our missile defense systems]{.underline}.
So China has, over the last decade, with great care, \[become\] capable
of ... [holding our forward-based assets at risk."]{.underline} Those
carriers and forward-based forces are strategic assets and the "means by
which we project strategic power short of nuclear deterrence." [Without
countering it, "we allow]{.underline} their [**tactical systems** to
leverage our ability to **project strategic power**."]{.underline} [The
[US will]{.mark} have to [develop means to defend]{.mark} against
hypersonic missiles **[soon]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Griffin said. The
Missile Defense Agency (MDA) will have that responsiblity, not the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). By July, Griffin was
expected to finish a new hypersonics roadmap that would rationalize and
coordinate at least a half dozen projects within and between the Air
Force, Army and Navy, DARPA, the Pentagon's Strategic Capabilities
Office, NASA, and defense contractors. Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick
M. Shanahan told reporters in April that Griffin had just delivered "80
percent" of the plan and was working on the final version. "The overlap
of the technical challenges is pretty high," Shanahan said of the
various approaches being taken. The basic physics of getting to
hypersonic speed and maintaining it, while preserving maneuvering
capability, are common to the various approaches underway, he asserted.
The Pentagon will look for synergy between the programs, seeking to
consolidate them where practical, saving money but also sharing
information. The services would integrate their own unique requirements
as to whether their specific vehicles are air-, land- or sea-launched.
The roadmap, Shanahan said, will cross "10 technical domains" and
determine the critical tests that must be conducted in the next five
years "to achieve capability within the next decade." The document might
just as well be called a "hypersonic prototype plan," Shanahan said. The
roadmap will also inform the Pentagon's five-year spending plan. Mark J.
Lewis, director of IDA's Science and Technology Policy Institute, a
former chief scientist of the Air Force and a leading expert in
hypersonics, said there are "a couple of characteristics I would want to
see in a generic \[hypersonics\] roadmap." Lewis is not involved in
developing the plan, which is likely classified. He spoke to Air Force
Magazine as a sidebar to an AFA technology podcast. DON'T RULE ANYTHING
OUT First, Lewis said the plan should "build directly on past successes.
Meaning, stop reinventing the wheel." At least one successor program to
the X-51, he said, largely repeats what that project already achieved,
with some minor additions. Second, he said, the roadmap "shouldn't
zero-in to a single technology solution. It shouldn't be just
air-breathing or just boost-glide. They have different strengths \[and\]
weaknesses and different applications." Necking down to a single,
quick-and-dirty approach "to me, would be a wrong answer." He also
advised that while hypersonics as a conventional strategic weapon may
very well be what China is looking for, it doesn't have to be that and,
[[for]{.mark} the [US]{.mark}, "the [**winning applications** are
not]{.mark} the [strategic]{.mark} applications."]{.underline} The US
could develop hypersonic air-to-air missiles, for example, that could
destroy enemy aircraft at great distances, before they could pose a
threat. There is also the potential for air-to-ground missiles covering
100 miles in as many seconds, offering opportunities to destroy enemy
air defenses from standoff range. Given the extreme destructive force of
an impacting vehicle traveling at Mach 6, [a [warhead]{.mark} might
[not]{.mark} **even be [necessary]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Such
applications "are the ones **most likely to be useful** to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [frankly," Lewis
asserted]{.underline}. Air Force Research Laboratory chief Maj. Gen.
William T. Cooley, in a February interview, took issue with the
characterization of some post-X-51 efforts as a virtual repeat of that
program. "I would say that's not true and largely because of the
people," Cooley averred. "The same scientists and engineers who had been
working on the X-51 are continuing to advance our hypersonics portfolio,
and so they are well aware ... of the data that was collected" on that
program. "We're advancing the ball forward," he added, saying the X-51
was "a point design ...to prove out our understanding and we're building
on that." [The Pentagon is taking hypersonics much more
seriously---budget-wise]{.underline}---than it did in the past. Boeing
hypersonics expert Kevin G. Bowcutt, whose experience stretches back to
the National Aerospace Plane project of the early 1980s, said in an
interview that Pentagon funding for hypersonics after NASP "has had an
oscillatory funding profile," going up and down between \$50 and \$100
million a year. In Fiscal 2017, the Defense Department funded
hypersonics to the tune of just \$85.5 million, and that rose to \$108.6
million in Fiscal 2018, but exploded to \$256.7 million in the 2019
budget request. Congress has indicated its willingness to support that
figure, and even add to it. ["This may be a '**Sputnik moment**,'?"
Bowcutt said]{.underline} of the sudden turnaround in both interest and
financial support of hypersonics, driven by the prospect of being behind
China and maybe Russia. ACRONYM MENAGERIE The Air Force has been working
with DARPA for several years on two hypersonic projects. One is the
Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept, or HAWC, and the other is the
Tactical Boost-Glide program, or TBG. The Air Force chose Lockheed
Martin and Raytheon to develop its HAWC concept, while [[Lockheed is
**the prime contractor**]{.underline}]{.mark} for TBG. Additionally,
[the Air Force is launching **two [new]{.mark} prototyping
[efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Fiscal 2019 budget, with \$260
million: [the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, or [**ARRW**,
and]{.mark} the Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon,
HCSW]{.underline}, which USAF pronounces as

[[As the]{.mark} **global [race]{.mark}** [for hypersonic]{.mark}

[military]{.mark}]{.underline} just [[decided to abandon]{.mark} one of
**[its]{.mark} fundamental [prototype]{.mark}
program[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[The]{.underline} U.S. [[Air Forc]{.mark}e]{.underline} on Monday said
it [[will cancel]{.underline}]{.mark} its Hypersonic Conventional Strike
Weapon, known as HCSW (pronounced
[\"**[Hacksaw]{.mark}**\"]{.underline}), in order [[to]{.mark} [shift
resources to]{.mark}]{.underline} its other program, the Air-launched
Rapid Response Weapon [([ARRW]{.mark}). [Both]{.mark}]{.underline}
prototypes [[are]{.mark} designed [by Lockheed]{.mark}
Martin]{.underline} Corp.

[\"[Due to **budget**]{.mark} **priorities**, the [Air Force]{.mark}
[**down-selected** to **one**]{.mark} hypersonic weapon
[prototyping]{.mark} effort this year,\"]{.underline} spokeswoman Ann
[Stefanek said]{.underline}. Instead, she said, the service will
concentrate efforts on [[ARRW]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[is \"**on
track**]{.mark} for an]{.underline} early [operational capability
in]{.underline} fiscal [2022.\"]{.underline}

Stefanek explained that ARRW \-- pronounced \"Arrow\" \-- offers a
\"unique glide body design as compared to other prototyping efforts.\"

\"We will continue to work collaboratively with our sister services to
see how we can most effectively leverage each other\'s capabilities,
[[ensuring **the most**]{.mark} [**prudent use** of]{.mark} taxpayer
[dollars]{.mark}]{.underline},\" she said.

The Air Force informed Lockheed of its decision on Monday; the service
will still continue to work with Lockheed on HCSW until the prototype\'s
critical design review in the spring before the termination, Stefanek
said.

In its fiscal 2021 budget request unveiled Monday, the Air Force said it
needs \$382 million for hypersonics research, test and development. Last
year, [lawmakers gave]{.underline} the service [\$576
million]{.underline} for the effort.

\"The [[HCSW]{.underline}]{.mark} team pioneered significant
advancements in hypersonic technology development and integration of
existing, mature technologies for use in various hypersonic efforts
across the Department of Defense, including Army, Navy, and Missile
Defense Agency programs,\" Stefanek said. \"These advancements
[will]{.underline} serve to **[[expedite]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
generation and demonstration of various [[hypersonic]{.mark} weapon
capabilitie[s]{.mark} **[in the near future]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\"

The contract for the Hacksaw project was awarded in 2018. [It was
[estimated to cost]{.mark}]{.underline} as much as **[[\$928
million]{.underline}]{.mark}** over the course of its lifetime.

Hypersonic weapons are meant to move at five times the speed of sound or
more. While little has been disclosed on either Air Force program,
Aerojet Rocketdyne announced last year it would partner with Lockheed on
the HCSW endeavor.

The company said it has worked on creating both solid-fueled and
air-breathing ramjet and scramjet capabilities for hypersonic
technologies, and pointed to its successful test of the the X-51A
Waverider, a hydrocarbon-fueled and scramjet-powered cruise missile
prototype that was the first to achieve hypersonic speeds in 2013.

Aerojet in September said it was looking in part to use Waverider as a
blueprint for HCSW.

Scramjet \-- short for supersonic combustion ramjet \-- technologies use
an airbreathing jet engine that compresses incoming air, but needs to
retain extreme high speeds to compress that air. In order to do that,
they are first propelled by a booster to reach hypersonic speeds.

Meanwhile, the Air Force conducted its first test of the AGM-183A ARRW
in June, flying the weapon on a B-52 Stratofortress bomber aircraft at
Edwards Air Force Base, California. [ARRW]{.underline}, which has a
tactical boost-glide body, [completed its preliminary design review in
March 2019]{.underline}, Lockheed said at the time.

[Development of [hypersonics]{.mark} is moving so quickly]{.underline},
however, [that it threatens to outpace any real discussion about the
potential perils of such weapons, including how they may [disrupt
efforts to avoid **accidental conflict**, especially during **crises**.
There are]{.mark} currently **[no]{.mark} international
[agreements]{.mark}** on how or when hypersonic missiles can be used,
nor are there any plans between any countries to start those
discussions. Instead, [the rush]{.mark} to possess weapons of incredible
speed and maneuverability has [pushed]{.mark} the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [into [a]{.mark} new
**[arms race]{.mark}** with Russia and China --- [one]{.mark} that
could]{.underline}, some experts worry, [**[upend]{.mark} existing
[norms of deterrence]{.mark}** [and **renew Cold War**]{.mark}**-era
[tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Although hypersonic missiles can in theory carry nuclear warheads, those
being developed by the United States will only be equipped with small
conventional explosives. With a length between just five and 10 feet,
weighing about 500 pounds and encased in materials like ceramic and
carbon fiber composites or nickel-chromium superalloys, the missiles
function like nearly invisible power drills that smash holes in their
targets, to catastrophic effect. After their launch --- whether from the
ground, from airplanes or from submarines --- they are pulled by gravity
as they descend from a powered ascent, or propelled by highly advanced
engines. The missiles' kinetic energy at the time of impact, at speeds
of at least 1,150 miles per hour, makes them powerful enough to
penetrate any building material or armored plating with the force of
three to four tons of TNT.

They could be aimed, in theory, at Russian nuclear-armed ballistic
missiles being carried on trucks or rails. Or the Chinese could use
their own versions of these missiles to target American bombers and
other aircraft at bases in Japan or Guam. Or the missiles could attack
vital land- or sea-based radars anywhere, or military headquarters in
Asian ports or near European cities. The weapons could even suddenly
pierce the steel decks of one of America's 11 multibillion-dollar
aircraft carriers, instantly stopping flight operations, a vulnerability
that might eventually render the floating behemoths obsolete. Hypersonic
missiles are also ideal for waging a decapitation strike ---
assassinating a country's top military or political officials. "Instant
leader-killers," a former Obama administration White House official, who
asked not to be named, said in an interview.

[Within the next decade, these new weapons could undertake a task long
imagined for nuclear arms: a first strike against another nation's
government or arsenals, interrupting key chains of communication and
disabling some of its retaliatory forces, all without]{.underline} the
[radioactive fallout and special condemnation that]{.underline} might
[accompany]{.underline} the detonation of [nuclear
warheads]{.underline}. That's why a National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering and Medicine report said in 2016 that hypersonics aren't
"simply evolutionary threats" to the United States but could in the
hands of enemies "challenge this nation's tenets of global vigilance,
reach and power."

[The arrival of]{.underline} such [[fast weaponry]{.mark} will
dangerously [compress]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[time]{.underline}]{.mark} during which military officials and their
political leaders --- in any country --- can figure out the nature of an
attack and make reasoned decisions about the wisdom and scope of
defensive steps or retaliation. [[And]{.mark} the threat]{.underline}
that hypersonics pose to retaliatory weapons
[[creates]{.underline}]{.mark} what scholars call [**["use it or lose

Strategic Implications of Hypersonic Weapons Compressed Timelines The
U.S. military uses an acronym to describe the decisionmaking and action
process cycle: OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act). These four steps
take time, and hypersonic missiles compress available response time to
the point that a lesser nation's strategic forces might be disarmed
before acting. As an illustration of the time required to act with
respect to an existential missile threat, [the Nuclear Threat Initiative
organization estimated]{.underline} a timeline for [a U.S. response to a
massive Russian]{.underline} intercontinental ballistic missile
([ICBM]{.underline}) [attack]{.underline}, as [follows]{.underline}:9 •
0 minutes---Russia launches missiles • 1 minute---U.S. satellite detects
missiles • 2 minutes---U.S. radar detects missiles • 3 minutes---North
American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) assesses information (2
minutes max) • 4 minutes---NORAD alerts White House • 5 minutes---first
detonations of submarine-launched ballistic missiles • 7
minutes---locate president and advisers, assemble them, brief them, get
decision (8 minutes max) • 13 minutes---decision • 15 minutes---transmit
orders to start launch sequence • 20 minutes---launch officers receive,
decode, and authenticate orders • 23 minutes---complete launch sequence
(2 minutes max) • **[25 minutes]{.underline}**---Russian ICBM
detonations. [This]{.underline} timeline [is not, of course,
representative of two hostile parties in closer proximity or with less
effective warning systems]{.underline} than Russia and the United
States. [Nor is it representative of less-than-Armageddon possibilities.
However, for]{.underline} **[adjacent enemies]{.underline}** [within
a]{.underline} [**1,000-km range**, a [hypersonic]{.mark} missile
traveling at **ten times the speed of sound**]{.underline} [could cover
that distance and [reduce response times to]{.mark} about]{.underline}
**[[six minutes]{.underline}]{.mark}**.10 Targets As discussed earlier,
[hypersonic missiles **increase the threat**]{.underline} [over current
generations]{.underline} of missiles [in cases where the
target]{.underline} nation [has]{.underline} **[missile
defenses]{.underline}**. The targets in such nations would primarily be
high value and heavily defended. [Prime targets could include destroying
a nation's leadership and command and control, referred to as
"decapitation," to prevent the target nation from responding with an
effective follow-on attack. Other key [targets could be]{.mark} carrier
strike groups]{.underline}, with the objective of striking a key blow or
pushing the naval formation further from the coast. And, [because of
their time sensitivity, strategic forces and storage facilities
for]{.underline} weapons of mass destruction
(**[[WMDs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [could warrant hypersonic
attack]{.underline}. Implications for Targeted Nations [Any government
faced with the]{.underline} **[possibility that hypersonic missiles
would be employed against it]{.underline}**---particularly in a
decapitating attack--- [would plan]{.underline}
**[[countermeasures]{.underline}]{.mark}**, many of [which [could be
**destabilizing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, countermeasures
could include [[devolution of]{.underline}]{.mark} strategic forces'
**[[c]{.mark}ommand [and c]{.mark}ontrol]{.underline}** so that lower
levels of authority could execute a strategic strike, which
[would]{.underline} obviously [increase the [risk]{.mark}
of]{.underline} **[[accidental]{.mark} strategic
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}**; or [[strategic forces]{.underline}]{.mark}
could be [[more]{.underline}]{.mark} **[widely
[dispersed]{.mark}]{.underline}**--- a tactic
[[risk]{.underline}]{.mark}ing greater exposure to [**[subnational
capture]{.mark}**. An obvious measure would be]{.underline} a
**[[l]{.underline}]{.mark}**aunch-**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**n-**[[w]{.underline}]{.mark}**arning
[posture]{.underline}---[a]{.underline} **[hair-trigger
tactic]{.underline}** [that would [increase]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**crisis [instability]{.mark}**. Or the target nation could adopt a
policy of]{.underline} **[[preemption]{.underline}]{.mark}** during a
crisis---[**[guarantee]{.mark}**ing]{.underline} **[highly
[destructive]{.mark} military [action]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To be
sure, such measures could be invoked against threats from current types
of missiles.11 But, for nations with effective ballistic mis- sile
and/or cruise missile defenses in the time frame when hypersonic
missiles might proliferate, the hard choices would be forced when facing
hypersonic threats. Advanced nations with adequate resources could take
other steps against hypersonic threats. They could strengthen the
resilience of their command and control, harden the siting of their
strategic forces, and make a deterrent force mobile or sea-based. These
tactics may or may not be effective, especially for lesser nations. And
they certainly will be expensive---putting them out of reach of some.
Even for major powers, the proliferation of hypersonic missiles will
create new threats by allowing lesser powers to hold them at risk of
effective missile attacks especially against "unhardened" targets, e.g.,
cities. Over the coming decades, the ability of a lesser nation with a
handful of ICBMs to threaten major powers will continue to decrease as
wide area missile defenses continue to improve. However, HGVs and HCMs
will be more difficult to defend against. Implications for Major Powers
The ability of hypersonic missiles to penetrate advanced missile
defenses will increase the risks for nations with such defenses.
**[Lesser [powers]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[with **hypersonic**]{.mark}
weapon**[s]{.mark}** may [see these]{.mark} weapons [as
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[deterrent]{.underline}**]{.mark} against
greater power intervention, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} feel free to
[[pursue]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially **[[destabilizing]{.mark}
regional [agendas]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Moreover, [lesser nations with
hypersonic missiles could affect]{.underline} the **[force
deployments]{.underline}** of major powers. As noted above,
**[c]{.underline}**arrier **[s]{.underline}**trike
**[g]{.underline}**roup**[s]{.underline}** [might be pushed further
**out to sea**]{.underline} [or an intervening power's regional
**military bases**]{.underline} [might become exposed]{.underline} to
more effective attacks. The Broader Picture of Increased Risk [The
ability of hypersonic forces to]{.underline} **[penetrate
defenses]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[compress decision
time]{.underline}** [could [aggravate]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[**instabilities** in]{.underline}]{.mark} regions that are already
tense---for example, [[**Iran-Israel** and
**No**]{.underline}]{.mark}rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea--[**[Japan]{.mark}**. Conflicts in
these regions could [**evolve** to include]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[major powers]{.mark} aligned [on opposite sides]{.mark}**.
An]{.underline} **[Israel-Iran]{.underline}** [conflict, [with the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[and]{.underline} much of **[[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}** [aligned
with Israel and]{.underline} [[**Russia** and]{.underline}]{.mark}
perhaps [**[China]{.mark}** aligned with]{.underline} [**Iran**, would
[create]{.mark}]{.underline} new **[[paths for escalation]{.mark} to an
even-larger conflict]{.underline}**. The basic roles of external actors
would not necessarily change---the alignments would stay the same---but
[external powers might suddenly find themselves in a]{.underline}
more-**[unstable situation]{.underline}** [in which their patron states
are]{.underline} **[increasingly trigger-happy]{.underline}**. As noted
previously, lesser powers could gain influence over major powers by
threatening a hypersonic attack. At the least, [lesser powers might be
emboldened if they saw themselves as possessing a deterrent against
major power intervention]{.underline}. Finally, because [hypersonic
weapons]{.underline} increase the expectation of a disarming attack,
they **[lower the threshold]{.underline}** [for military
action]{.underline}.

#### Each scenario goes [global]{.underline}, it's [most probable]{.underline}, and it [implodes]{.underline} any arms control

Michael **Richardson 13**, Visiting Senior Research Fellow at the
Institute of South East Asian Studies in Singapore, Former South-East
Asia Correspondent of The Age, "Cruise Missile Threat in Asia", Japan
Times, 6/18/2013,

[Cruise [missiles]{.mark} that are **[difficult to detect]{.mark}**,
increasingly fast and capable of [carrying **nuc**]{.mark}lear
[warhead**s** are spreading]{.mark}, especially in **Asia**,
[**complicating arms control** and]{.mark} raising the [risk]{.mark} of
**[catastrophic conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Until recently, most concerns have focused on the actual or potential
spread of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles in China, North Korea, India
and Pakistan --- the four Asian states known to have atomic arms.
Ballistic missiles, launched by rocket engines, follow an arc-like
trajectory, attaining hypersonic speeds on the downward leg of their
guided journey towards a target.

Until now and probably for some time yet, all long-range ballistic
missiles, with atomic warheads small enough to fit on them, are deployed
exclusively for strategic nuclear deterrence. The five official nuclear
weapon states --- United States, Russia, China, Britain and France ---
use their long-range ballistic missiles, whether launched from land, air
or sea, to deter possible attacks by other nuclear-armed nations.

Arms control treaties and agreements have tended to focus chiefly on
ballistic missiles. However, another type of weapon, the cruise missile,
is multiplying. It is proving to be even more difficult to control,
partly because in many cases the same highly accurate missile is
designed to carry either a conventional high explosive warhead or a
nuclear warhead.

This [[dual role]{.mark} makes it impossible]{.underline} for a
nuclear-armed nation facing a cruise missile attack against its
territory or warships [to know whether the incoming weapons are
conventional or nuclear, an [uncertainty]{.mark} that could **[trigger a
nuclear response]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Dual-role ballistic missiles of
less than intercontinental range pose a similar problem.

The U.S. Air Force Global Strike Command reported last month that both
[**China** and **North Korea** were developing]{.underline}
nuclear-capable cruise missiles. [The **U.S.** and **Russia**
lead]{.underline} the world with nuclear-capable cruise missiles,
weapons launched from long-range bombers or submarines. [But **India**
and **Pakistan** are also developing such missiles]{.underline}. They
each have several different types, with different ranges, in service or
being flight tested.

Cruise missiles, powered by jet engines, travel low and fast over land
or water, making them difficult to detect. They are also relatively
small, compared to long-range ballistic missiles.

There are about 1,140 of the nuclear version of the U.S. AGM-86
air-launched cruise missile in America's nuclear arsenal. In addition,
there are about 460 nuclear-capable AGM-129A advanced cruise missiles.
The U.S. Air Force says that the streamlined design of the AGM-129A,
combined with radar-absorbing material and several other features, make
it virtually impossible to detect on radar.

The range of the U.S. AGM-129 A is officially put at almost 3,220 km.
However, the nuclear-ready version of Russia's Raduga Kh-101
air-launched cruise missile, which is due to become operational this
year, is designed to have a maximum flight distance of just over 9,650
km, which puts it in the range category of an intercontinental ballistic
missile.

The new Chinese and North Korean cruise missiles appeared on a slide of
an unclassified briefing given by Lt. Gen. James Kowalski, head of the
U.S. Air Force Global Strike Command, on May 7. The slide shows nuclear
weapon modernizations in eight of the world's nine states known to have
atomic arms. Only Israel is not shown.

The Chinese cruise missile is the CJ-20 carried by the long-range H-6
bomber. Hans Kristensen, a nuclear weapons specialist with the
Federation of American Scientists, said the listing was the first he had
seen in an official U.S. publication crediting a Chinese air-launched
cruise missile with nuclear capability.

U.S. defense officials say that a Chinese extended range H-6 bomber
using the CJ-20 in a land-attack operation could strike targets all over
Asia and eastern Russia as well as the U.S. military base hub on Guam
island, in the western Pacific. Two-thirds of Russian territory, east of
the Ural mountains, is in Asia.

The nuclear-capable North Korean cruise missile listed on the briefing
slide is the KN-09 for coastal defense. It reportedly has a range of
just 100 to 120 km.

America's AGM-86 nuclear-tipped cruise missiles travel at just over
two-thirds the speed of sound.

Meanwhile, India is looking to its supersonic Brahmos cruise missile, a
joint venture with Russia, as the key new weapon that will give it a
strategic advantage over its neighbor and long-time rival, Pakistan. The
Brahmos is the only known supersonic cruise missile system in service.
Its designer, BrahMos Aerospace of Russia, says it travels at two to
three times the speed of sound, or approximately one kilometer per
second.

In October, India and Russia agreed to produce more than 1,000 Brahmos
missiles for the Indian Air Force, Navy and Army. The two sides also
decided to jointly develop a hypersonic version of the missile that
would fly more than five times the speed of sound.

The Indian missile, which can be launched from the sea, air or land, has
a range of about 300 km. It can carry a conventional or nuclear warhead.
The high speed of India's Brahmos cruise missile means it has the
potential to carry out prompt strikes on extremist camps inside
Pakistan, to be followed by a punitive invasion by the Indian armed
forces.

Because India is so much bigger and stronger than Pakistan, the latter
has developed short-range ballistic missiles with low-yield nuclear
warheads to deter such attacks. Although still to be verified, Pakistan
claims it has miniaturized nuclear warheads so that they will also fit
on cruise missiles. India also says that its cruise missiles are
nuclear-capable.

[The **[short-warning time]{.mark}** should either country use such
weapons against the other [means]{.mark} that [**escalation**
into]{.mark} an **all-out nuclear exchange** could result]{.underline}.

Shyam Saran, convener of India's National Security Advisory Board, said
in April that in a crisis with **[Pakistan]{.underline}**, India would
not be the first to use nuclear weapons. He warned that even if India
was attacked with relatively small, or tactical, nuclear arms, it [would
"engage in **nuclear retaliation** that will be **massive**]{.underline}
and designed to inflict unacceptable damage on its adversary."

There is a wider warning here for Asian countries with tactical
nuclear-tipped cruise or ballistic missiles in operation or planned.
[[If]{.mark} ever [used]{.mark}, such [weapons]{.mark} could **[open a
Pandora's Box]{.mark}** of horrendous consequences, [proving]{.mark}
that a **[limited nuclear war]{.mark}** is [a **contradiction**]{.mark}
**in terms**]{.underline}.

support. It means assisting Israel in maintaining military superiority
over its neighbors, so that it can defend itself by itself.

[As the United States retrenches from the Middle East, the value of a
strong]{.underline} and capable [Israel has only grown. [Israel]{.mark}
has shouldered the burden of [counter]{.mark}ing U.S. enemies ([Iran,
ISIS]{.mark}, Hezbollah]{.underline} and the Muslim Brotherhood) [[while
strengthening]{.mark} the [security]{.mark} of U.S.
partners]{.underline} (Jordan and Egypt), without requiring American
boots on the ground.

[[Israel's edge]{.mark}, however, [has been eroding]{.mark} for years.
[Iran has been expanding its]{.mark} regional [footprint]{.mark} and
boosting the capabilities of Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the
Houthis and other Shia militias]{.underline} in Iraq, Lebanon and Syria,
all [[while continuing to develop]{.mark} its [nuc]{.mark}lear
[program]{.mark}]{.underline}. It, and an increasingly aggressive
Turkey, have invested in drones, advanced air defense capabilities and
ballistic missiles. Israel's Arab neighbors, in response, have embarked
on buying sprees of advanced weapons.

**[Middle Eastern instability means today's friend could become
tomorrow's adversary]{.underline}**. The UAE, an American ally and
treaty partner with Israel, poses no threat today to Israel, but one
can't be sure what the future holds. What we do know is that Qatar,
hardly a reliable U.S. partner, just requested to purchase F-35s, with
other regional countries sure to follow.

Previously, when the United States sold advanced weapons to Arab
countries, it subsequently supplied Israel with more weaponry. For
instance, in 1989, after selling Saudi Arabia hundreds of
latest-generation tanks, the United States emplaced \$100 million of
military equipment in Israel, and accessible to Israel, in a stockpile
known as WRSA-I.

We recently spelled out several steps America should take to preserve
Israel's ability to defend itself by itself, and [one of [the most
important is to restock]{.mark}]{.underline} the WRSA-I with modern
equipment, especially precision-guided munitions
([[PGMs]{.underline}]{.mark}) such as the Joint Direct Attack Munitions.
**[[The existing stockpile has become obsolete]{.mark} and
useless]{.underline}**. We understand [it hasn't been upgraded since
before the Obama administration, over 10 years ago.]{.underline}

[[PGMs are crucial]{.mark} for Israel [because they can accurately hit
ground targets]{.mark} while limiting collateral damage such as civilian
casualties. Israel already uses many U.S.-sourced PGMs to roll back
Iran's region-wide military entrenchment]{.underline}. But [in the event
of a major war]{.underline} with Iran and its proxy Hezbollah with its
130,000 missiles and rockets[, [it will need many more]{.mark}. An
emergency resupply of Israel]{.underline}, amid conflict, such as during
the 1973 Yom Kippur War, [would take time. Better to plan
ahead.]{.underline}

[Prepositioning [PGMs]{.mark}]{.underline} in WRSA-I and providing
Israel emergency access (via sale or transfer), while retaining U.S.
control, **[[would solve]{.mark} this shortfall.]{.underline}** It also
would be consistent with language in the current Senate version of the
National Defense Authorization Act: "To the extent practicable, the
Secretary of Defense should take further measures to expedite deliveries
of precision-guided munitions to Israel."

#### NATO is a multi-tiered alliance. Partner countries are included. 

**Matláry 14** \[Matláry, J.H. (2014). Partners versus Members? NATO as
an Arena for Coalitions. In: Mayer, S. (eds) NATO's Post-Cold War

In this chapter, I discuss the importance of burden-sharing partnerships
with [NATO]{.underline} as a development that is, as I argue,
symptomatic of the evolution of the Alliance into becoming an arena or
platform for coalitions of the 'willing and able'. After the end of the
Cold War, we live in an era where armed attacks against one or several
Alliance members, obliging others to respond immediately (although not
necessarily by military means), have become rare and unlikely. As a
result, the organization [has increasingly turned into a 'two-tiered' or
'**multi-tiered**' alliance. Current operations are mostly Article
4]{.underline} and hence, unlike Article 5 cases, voluntary. [This
implies that partners, as well as members, may contribute.]{.underline}
Moreover, few members seem to be willing and able to make a
contribution,1 something that inter alia the Libya operation has shown
--- only eight allies were actually willing to contribute combat
capabilities. In other operations, like ISAF, all members contribute,
but only a few with risk-willing capabilities. All 'show the flag', but
few are willing and able to contribute to sharp operations that require
top skill and risk-willingness.

Foreign Entities".
<https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46337/2> DOA: 07-05-2022
//ArchanSen\]

[The sale and export of U.S]{.underline}.-origin [weapons to foreign
countries]{.underline} ("defense articles and defense services,"
officially) [are governed by an extensive set of laws]{.underline},
regulations, policies, and procedures. Congress has authorized such
sales under two laws:

The Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) of 1961, 22 U.S.C. §2151, et seq.

The Arms Export Control Act (AECA) of 1976, 22 U.S.C. §2751, et seq.

**[The FAA and AECA govern all transfers of U.S.-origin defense articles
and services]{.underline}**, whether they are commercial sales,
government-to-government sales, or security assistance/security
cooperation grants (or building partnership capacity programs provided
by U.S. military personnel). [These measures can be provided by **Title
22**]{.underline} (Foreign Relations) [or **Title 10**]{.underline}
(Armed Services) [authorities]{.underline}. Arms sold or transferred
under these authorities are regulated by the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations (ITAR) and the U.S. Munitions List (USML), which are
located in Title 22, Parts 120-130 of the Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR).

The two main methods for the sale and export of U.S.-made weapons are
the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program and Direct Commercial Sales
(DCS) licenses. Some other arms sales occur from current Department of
Defense (DOD) stocks through Excess Defense Articles (EDA) provisions.

[For FMS, the U.S. government procures defense articles as an
intermediary for foreign partners' acquisition of defense articles and
defense services]{.underline}, which ensures that the articles have the
same benefits and protections that apply to the U.S. military's
acquisition of its own articles and services.

For DCS, registered U.S. firms may sell defense articles directly to
foreign partners though licenses and agreements received from the
Department of State[. Firms are still required to obtain State
Department approval, and for major sales DOD review and congressional
notification is required.]{.underline} In some cases where U.S. firms
have entered into international partnerships to produce some major
weapons systems, comprehensive export regulations under 22 CFR 126.14
are intended to allow exports and technical data for those systems
without having to go through the licensing process.

DOA: 7-1-2022 //ArchanSen\]

Some might say that this commentary paints an overly gloomy picture for
Ukraine---that [[game-changing weapons are on their way]{.mark}, and
these will be enough to turn the tide]{.underline}. It is true that [the
US-made]{.underline} High Mobility Artillery Rocket System
([HIMARS]{.underline}), [already operating in Ukraine, is a formidable
weapon and a welcome improvement]{.underline} on the Ukrainians'
over-used Soviet howitzers and even the recently supplied M777
lightweight 155-millimeter howitzer, whose deficiencies I have written
about recently. Even lacking the long-range Army Tactical Missile
System, HIMARS can bring accurate fires to bear at ranges exceeding
forty miles within minutes of receiving data.

[[It will be weeks]{.mark}, however, [before HIMARS is fielded in
sufficient quantity]{.mark} to have a significant effect---**maybe [too
late to reverse the Russian advance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The
logistical exigencies of getting more into theater and then bringing
Ukrainian artillery personnel to Germany or Poland for training stand in
the way. Meanwhile [the hemorrhage of casualties
continues]{.mark}]{.underline}. And even when fielded, the [[HIMARS will
not have the same effect for the Ukrainians as when employed by the US
military]{.mark}, because of a shortfall in Ukrainian task
organization.]{.underline} The tactical units we trained lacked forward
observers, personnel trained to locate and report targets in a manner
that can be rapidly transferred into firing data. The extremely
centralized execution of artillery fire in the Ukrainian army makes for
some effective fires for effect, such as the recent one that struck
several Russian generals, but is not very responsive to the needs of
frontline units.

### \*2AC\-\--A2: Turkey PIC

#### Turkey won't leave. 

**The Economist 22** \[The Economist, 06-16-2022, \"Is Turkey more

DOA: 7-2-2022 //ArchanSen\]

None of this spells doom for the relationship between Turkey and NATO.
Western countries will try to work round Turkey's veto by providing
Finland and Sweden with security guarantees. This may leave Turkey
sidelined within the alliance. But its departure or eviction from NATO
is still fantasy. Turkey is on the front line of the war in Syria and
close to other conflicts in the Middle East; it controls access to the
Black Sea, which has been central to all of Russia's recent wars; and it
serves as a corridor for trade between Central Asia and Europe,
especially in energy, notes Ben Hodges, a former commander of American
forces in Europe. "I don't even want to think of NATO without Turkey,"
he says.

Especially in the wake of Russia's war in Ukraine, Turkey also has no
interest in surrendering the power of deterrence that nato membership
offers. "I don't believe it will ever happen," says Tacan Ildem,
Turkey's former permanent representative to NATO. There is no credible
alternative, he says. Turkey will probably remain a headache for the
alliance, even when Mr Erdogan is out of the picture. But it is a
headache nato will have to live with.

**[[Iceland]{.mark}, unique among NATO Allies, [does not have a

their country's pacifist tradition, which goes back further than its
independence from Denmark in 1944. So the decision to join the Alliance
as a founding member in 1949 was controversial. Throughout the Cold War,
Iceland had several national debates about whether or not to withdraw
from NATO. But despite this internal ambivalence, Iceland has
continuously contributed as a valuable member of NATO, based on shared
values and unity, democracy and freedom. During the Cold War, Iceland
allowed NATO Allies to station troops on its strategically critical
island and volunteered the Icelandic Coast Guard to assist the
Organization, activities that were pursued after the fall of the Berlin
Wall.
