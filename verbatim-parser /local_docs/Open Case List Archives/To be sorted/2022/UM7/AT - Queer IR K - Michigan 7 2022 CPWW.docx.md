According to Gilles Deleuze, a concept ''should express an event rather
than an essence'' (1995: 14). Molar, [large-scale accounts of sex and
the state have assumed a **sameness to sex** and a **singular
rationality to state actors**, **decisions**, and **projects**. If the
state is not **unitary**, **coordinated**, and **hierarchically
organized** in an **ultimately rational way**]{.underline}---if, as
Michel Foucault suggests, ''the state is only a composite reality and a
mythicized abstraction whose importance is much less than we think''
(1991: 103)--- [then it should come **as no surprise** that state
definitions of sex **are also plural**]{.underline}. A contradiction is
something that does not make sense, a position that is logically
inconsistent. To begin by letting go of the assumption that there is any
''there there,'' any whatness, to (legal) sex apart from what an agency
says it is, the contradiction evaporates. [The official sex
designation]{.underline}---or, more precisely, the M or the F---
[stamped on documents or coded in records **becomes the starting
point**. Then an analysis can focus **not on what sex is**, or **what it
should be**, but on what it **does**, what it **accomplishes**, what it
**produces**.]{.underline} Indeed, if [the only thing we know for sure
about sex is what any of these many state actors say it is in any
particular instance, sex will turn out to be **as messy and diffuse a
concept as the state**. Entering into the analysis without a firm sense
of what sex is or what the state is---as **a priori facts**, as
**edifices**---makes the **processes through which they come into being
more visible**. It might be better to **defer attempts to resolve**---
**theoretically** or **politically**--- the messiness in order to
**understand what a particular system of sex designation does** for a
particular state project such as recognition or
redistribution]{.underline} (Currah, forthcoming). Of course, states
should not only or always be imagined as messy, scattered nodes of local
and arbitrary power arrangements. The Leviathan state's terrible
concentrated authority to impose sanctions (death, imprisonment, fines)
has been the subject of theories of sovereignty for centuries. For this
purpose, the most apt definition of the state begins with the simple
description from Max Weber: ''A human community that (successfully)
claims the monopoly of the legitimate physical violence within a
particular given territory'' (1991: 78). To create a truly compelling
account of sovereign violence and the paradox of sovereignty, one must
take Weber's definition, put question marks around ''legitimate,'' and
add the observation made by scholars such as Walter Benjamin, Carl
Schmitt, Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, and Giorgio Agamben that the
force that creates the law and makes it legitimate cannot be justified
by a law that does not yet exist. Still, [much of what states
do]{.underline}--- regulating the health, safety, and public welfare
through myriad regulations, rules, decisions, practices--- [**does not
reach** the threshold of juridical violence, even if those actions are
**ultimately undergirded by its threat**. Fetishizing a generalized idea
of the state and its **terrifying** or **redemptive power**]{.underline}
(depending on one's perspective) [can **obscure what is actually
happening** in the **local**, **micro**, **particular sites** where
**most public authority is exercised**. While it is crucial to theorize
the singular finality of state violence, neglecting to examine the
messiness of actually existing and potentially incommensurate
**policies**, **practices**, **rules**, and **norms** risks
**substituting the conceptual for the concrete** and **gets in the way
of understanding what might actually be going on**]{.underline} (Latour
1995: 48).

David Brook's latest column in the New York Times, banging on the same
themes about "the kids are just not right," raises some questions about
[what it means to engage in radical politics in the Trump
era]{.underline}. Brooks compares [the]{.underline} younger generation's
[belief "that the system itself is rotten and needs to be **torn
down**"]{.underline} to accomodationist and gradualisms. He continues on
to speculate about how these new attitudes might affect older, more
"pragmatic," liberals who desire to work within the system. Brooks, as
usual, uses a conservative argument to position himself in the "middle."
[I have been thinking]{.underline} a lot [about this issue of
**"radicalism"** contra arguments about **working within systems** that
are unjust in thinking about liberal world order and its
futures]{.underline}. It has led me to a question [I am]{.underline}
currently [exploring]{.underline} in a work-in-progress about what [the
possibilities]{.underline} are [of radicalism as a way of approaching
international politics]{.underline}. Against arguments like Brooks', and
even more sophisticated arguments about agonistic democracy developed by
thinkers like Chantal Mouffe, I think [there is a **place in IR** for
radical conceptions of transformation, order, and politics]{.underline}.
[What is radicalism?]{.underline} Brooks never fully fleshes out this
concept. [Philosophy and political theory have engaged with the issue of
radicalism as a concept, though the results are often
divergent]{.underline}. To quote Agnes Heller, in her treatise on
[radical philosophy]{.underline}, it "[can give the world a norm, and it
can will people to want to give a world to the norm]{.underline}."
[Radicalism as an idea, and as a form of critique, mobilizes many
different modes of thinking about the social and the
political]{.underline}. The most comprehensive definition of radicalism
is that provided by Paul [McLaughlin]{.underline}, who [defines
radicalism]{.underline} "[in terms of]{.underline} (i) [a fundamental
orientation]{.underline} (toward fundamental objects) (ii) [in the
political domain]{.underline} (iii) [of an argumentative
nature]{.underline}." More than that, though, we can add that
[radicalism intervenes in the political domain with the goal of
fundamental transformation]{.underline}. Additionally, [though
radicalism]{.underline} indeed [proceeds in an **argumentative nature**,
this methodology for argument is one that is aimed at critiquing, and
seeking the destruction/replacement of existing
institutions]{.underline}. [A revised]{.underline} working [definition
of radicalism]{.underline}, therefore, [is: a way of thinking about
politics that focuses on totalities, **praxis** and **political
action**, and the deployment of historicist methods with an eye toward
"getting to the root of things."]{.underline} Thus, [radicalism is both
a broad range of critical thought and practice, but also is specific in
the realms of focus, **action**, and method]{.underline}. If Brooks is
right that there is a major clash between a radical younger generation
and a more pragmatic and moderate older generation in American politics,
these differences are not well expressed in contemporary thinking about
IR. [Some of the biggest divisions are between]{.underline} what Robert
Cox called **["problem-solving theories"]{.underline}** [and theories
that **critique** such approaches, but provide little argumentation
aimed at tearing structures of injustice down altogether]{.underline}.
[In short: IR, **even at its critical ends**, **is not
radical**]{.underline} (for an excellent exception see here and here).
[Why is this important?]{.underline} This morning, I taught a seminar on
the question "Is Liberal World Order Finished?" [I asked my students to
think about what makes a liberal order "liberal," and then asked: "Can
we fix the liberal world order, or can we imagine a world without
it**?**]{.underline}---[and **what would that look like?**]{.underline}"
[The students were quick to point out the violences, inequities, and
problems inherent in a liberal world order, **but**]{.underline} [it
took a good bit of pushing and prodding to get them to articulate
**whether**/**how** we **should**/**could** take this order apart and
rethink it]{.underline}. [This was not just a difficult task for the
students---it is something IR has not spent enough time meditating
on]{.underline}.

[There is a lot to be critical of these days]{.underline}. And, I
disagree with Brooks's pessimism about a younger radical generation.
[Politics is deeply intertwined with engagements with
radicalism]{.underline}. [What]{.underline} I think [is
**missing**]{.underline} [when we consider global politics]{.underline},
though, [is that many of our pressing questions about institutions,
order, and state action proceed from the same sort of moderation,
accomodationism, or---at the most---an immanently critical
vein]{.underline}. If [we want to intellectually and politically
approach issues]{.underline} like: **[What do we make of the future(s)
of liberal world order?]{.underline}** IR needs to engage with
radicalism.

#### Alt fails---Trump era cemented heteronormative views within politics, cooption inevitable

**Weber 16** (Cynthia Weber, Professor of International Relations at the
University of Sussex, "Sovereignty, Sexuality And The Will To Trump: A
Queer IR Analysis And Response," 11-27-2016, accessed 07-21-2022,

[Crucially, the Trump campaign didn't just roll out its vision of this
'US sovereign subject' by **employing either/or logics**,]{.underline}
even though much of the time this seemed to be the case. Yes, Trump
pitted 'trustworthy' and 'untrustworthy' US citizens against one
another. But [he **constantly flip flopped on who these trustworthy and
untrustworthy citizens were**, whether in the case of women, 'the
blacks' or the first black President]{.underline} of the United States
of America[. The campaign also rolled out Mike Pence to deny many of the
things Trump said. And Trump made a lot of inherently contradictory
statements that suggested he was for and against some groups or policies
at the same time. For example, **Trump said, 'There can be no
discrimination against gays. I'm against gay
marriage'**]{.underline} (although in his 60 Minutes interview, Trump
said gay marriage was a legally settled issue). [Trump also made
inconsistent statements about the anti-trans\* bathroom
law]{.underline} in North Carolina. [Comments like these were implicitly
and explicitly made in the register of sex, gender and sexuality
throughout the campaign, and they were more consistent with and/or
logics and neither/nor logics than they were with either/or logics.
These statements demonstrate how some of** **]{.underline}**the
paradoxical figures and logics found in queer discourses were
coopted[ ]{.underline}**[by the Trump campaign for its own purposes. All
of this left many politicians, pundits, and ordinary US American
citizens wondering if Trump was a clown who should be laughed off or an
existential threat to the American democratic project. Trump positioned
himself as either and both and even neither as it suited his ambitions.
And he will likely continue to do so]{.underline} as the 45th President
of the United States. [What is to be done?]{.underline} As the US and
the world face up to the realities of the impossible Presidency that the
Trump campaign made possible, [there is no shortage of recommendations
circulating in critical camps about what is to be done. These include:
Organizing new coalitions and devising experimental techniques to make
them
effective; ]{.underline}**Disarming[ ]{.underline}**[the ]{.underline}**specific
modalities of citizenship, governance and reason[ ]{.underline}**[that
**make (un)reasonable identifications with a will to Trump possible;**
and** **]{.underline}**Resisting all[ ]{.underline}**[xenophobias, forms
of** **]{.underline}**racism[, ]{.underline}misogyny[, ]{.underline}homo/bi/trans\*phobias[,]{.underline}**
[and other oppressive ideologies and social relations that violently
order the world in whatever name -- be it** **]{.underline}**white
supremacy[, ]{.underline}rightwing nationalism[,]{.underline}**
[conservatism, or** **]{.underline}**neoliberalism**[. **I am less
hopeful**]{.underline} than Joan Cocks might be [that **these new
political alliances and institutions will be forged 'without sovereign
aspirations, delusions, or pretensions',**]{.underline} **whatever their
scale**[. And I may be more persuaded]{.underline} than Cocks [is that
**the counter-Trump re-imaginings of the US **that will support these
political alliances and institutions are** **]{.underline}**an essential
part of what makes radical change possible, even if these re-imaginings
fail to escape the 'delusion of sovereignty' and its corresponding
delusions of things like sex, gender and sexuality[.]{.underline}**
[This, it seems to me, is something]{.underline} **Trump's radical
re-imagining of the US as his platform for winning the White House
underscores**. As we all move forward and ready ourselves for some
difficult conversations, [this queer IR analysis suggests we keep the
following two points in mind]{.underline}. First, connections between
sovereignty, sex, gender and sexuality are neither academic nor trivial.
Nor are they separable from racisms, xenophobias and other systems of
power. How sovereignties are specifically sexualized, racialized,
classed and otherwise configured to authorize the defense of particular
nationalisms and internationalisms has real effects on real people. This
is as true in relation to the hate speech and physical violence
authorized in the name of Trump as it is for the policies that will
emerge from a Trump administration. Second, **exclusively
anti-normative, always contrarian, somehow liberating
understandings[ ]{.underline}**[of 'queer', 'queers', and 'queer logics'
can** **]{.underline}**obscure[ ]{.underline}**[the fact that 'queer' --
just like** **]{.underline}**any (dis)position, strategy, or tool -- can
be captured, mimicked, and mobilized[ ]{.underline}**[to map the world
in despicable ways.** **]{.underline}**Alt-Right[ ]{.underline}**[offers
one important example of a white supremacist
organization** **]{.underline}**adopting techniques of the
left[ ]{.underline}**[for such purposes. How the Trump
campaign** **]{.underline}**mobilized what (otherwise) might appear to
be queer logics of statecraft to de-normalize Clinton's 'neoliberal US
sovereign subject' on behalf of Trump's (re)normalized 'repressed,
entitled, white US sovereign subject'[ ]{.underline}**[is
another**. **]{.underline}**There is no reason to believe that, as
President, Trump will abandon the very logics and tactics that helped
win[ ]{.underline}**[him the Presidency]{.underline}. These are among
the stakes a queer IR analysis of a will to Trump makes plain. For
me, **opposing a will to Trump[ ]{.underline}**[starts by reminding
myself that -- like 'queer' -- a 'state's sovereign subjectivity
is..."\[i\]llusive, always on the move]{.underline}." It is "at best
like something, but it never is that something"'. Trump is of some
ever-changing United States of America, but Trump is not the United
States of America. The same can be said of the 'US sovereign subject'
Trump's campaign strategically figured to authorize Trump's will to
power. [It is in these gaps and fissures where I will pitch my political
tent and stage my** **]{.underline}**practical political resistance[ to
a will to Trump.]{.underline}**

Although he/she stands as an emblem of Cynthia's hope for pluralizing
the monolithic concept of sovereign man and for queering an integrated
Europe, I'm going to gesture only briefly to the border-straddling
Eurovision song contest winner Neuwirth/Wurst. I have to confess that
I've never watched Eurovision and so must trust Cynthia's reading of N/W
entirely, but as she depicts him/her, unlike the normal homosexual, this
bearded lady from Austria and Colombia managed to provoke wildly
clashing reactions from leaders and peoples in different countries and
of different political stripes by impaling him/herself on the border of
masculine and feminine, the Global North and Global South, secularism
and religion, white and brown racial identities, and national
particularity and regional integration. Still, while Cynthia's layered
reading of N/W is as sophisticated an interpretation of identity
deconstruction as any cultural theorist could hope for, **[a performance
of ambiguities in identity on stage]{.underline}**, **[and the parsing
of those ambiguities in a queer IR theory text]{.underline}**, **[can
push the world forward]{.underline}** (or, to the minds of N/W's
critics, backward) **[only so far]{.underline}**.

### perm

#### The perm allows for queer sensibility through more incorporation of queerness in IR

**Amoureux 15** -- Scholar postdoctoral fellow at Wake Forest
University; received his PhD from Brown University in Political Science
\[Jack, 2015, "Queer Ethics of World Politics", Academia.edu\]

In summarizing some of these themes, controversies and tensions, [I am
unavoidably reading queer theory as an IR scholar steeped in a
literature that, for the most part, has not accepted and has even been
actively hostile to a 'queer IR']{.underline} (Weber 2014b).
Nevertheless, [an **intersection of queer and 'dominant' IR is
potentially fruitful**, but it is not a matter of 'mixing and stirring'
since the **queer has been relevant to IR and world politics all
along**, in its dominant narratives of discipline as they extend through
the halls of power]{.underline}, products of media and culture, and the
offices, conference rooms [and journals of the field of International
Relations]{.underline} (Weber 2013; 2014a, 2014b; Wilcox 2015). In other
words, [I am interrogating IR]{.underline} from a body of literature
that has become known as 'queer theory' [but this effort should not be
read as a neglect of the ways in which a growing contingent of IR
scholars have read world politics through a queer lens to make up a rich
variety of critical and innovative approaches]{.underline}
