about the global collision of technology and politics "As Ukraine
conflict heats up, so too does disinformation," POLITICO, 1/27-/22,

Ukrainian special forces planning so-called \"false flag\" operations.
The United States considering chemical weapons attacks in the Eastern
European country. NATO preparing to attack Russia during the upcoming
Winter Olympics.

The [Kremlin is ratcheting up its disinformation game]{.underline} with
claims like these [amid rising geopolitical tensions]{.underline}
between Moscow and Western capitals, according to a review of
state-backed media content over the last 10 days by POLITICO.

The campaign --- spread via Moscow-backed outlets like RT, domestic
state-owned broadcasters and fake social media accounts in multiple
Western languages --- coincides with a large-scale military buildup
along the Ukrainian border and increased Western military aide to
support Kyiv.

Moscow\'s goal, according to three Western national security officials
and five external disinformation researchers, is to use wedge issues to
foster division among Western countries over their support for Ukraine;
counter NATO\'s claims against Moscow; and create plausible deniability
over potential atrocities including the possible use of chemical
weapons.

\"[Where they really are moving the needle is on undermining support for
U.S. internationalism,\"]{.underline} said Bret Schafer, head of the
information manipulation team at the German Marshall Fund\'s Alliance
for Securing Democracy, in reference to the Kremlin\'s disinformation
tactics.

\"[Russia state media messaging is more effective at chipping away at
the West\'s geopolitical goals than it is in dividing the West because
we do that well enough on our own]{.underline},\" he added.

In recent weeks, Western governments have been particularly vocal about
outing Russian online tactics. Two of the Western security officials,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss governments\'
internal strategies, said the amped-up response was partly because
Moscow has been successful in tilting public opinion around geopolitical
issues in the past.

The U.S. State Department published a \"cheat sheet\" seeking to explain
the Kremlin\'s online falsehoods, while also criticizing Moscow for its
\"disregard for truth.\" In the European Union, the so-called East
Stratcom team within the European External Action Service, which is
tasked with monitoring Russian online propaganda, highlighted the
Kremlin\'s tactics, although the 27-country bloc is still divided over
how strongly to push back against Moscow.

The Kremlin, in turn, has pushed back against the criticism, claiming
that Western governments and media are peddling mistruths about the
situation in Ukraine, and that it is Moscow, not Washington or Brussels,
that is pushing for a peaceful resolution.

Just like 2014, but worse

Russia is no newcomer to disinformation on Ukraine.

Since the country annexed part of its neighbor in 2014, Kremlin-backed
media has pumped out a steady stream of accusations that Kyiv is run by
neo-Nazis; that NATO is either too weak to defend the country or too
aggressive in its military stance; and that Western citizens did not see
the point in protecting Ukraine.

Those narratives are being updated amid the current tensions.

[Russian broadcasters have shaped the debate at home]{.underline} as
President Vladimir Putin defending the interests of Greater Russia,
including sending Russian troops to Belarus as a routine military
maneuver with a close ally. On the Kremlin\'s [international news
outlets]{.underline} --- which collectively [have millions of followers
on social media]{.underline} --- the likes of RT and Sputnik [have
criticized Western leaders for spending resources on Ukraine amid the
pandemic and questioned how defending Kyiv plays into the national
interests of either the U.S. or EU countries.]{.underline}

\"[The pro-Kremlin disinformation machine uses a well-known tactic of
throwing mud against a wall to see what sticks]{.underline},\" said one
of the Western officials, who was not authorized to speak publicly about
their work tracking Russian online tactics. \"[There are a lot of
contradictions but consistency has never been a strong suit of the
Kremlin\'s disinformation machine]{.underline}. [It's rather about
muddying the waters]{.underline}.\"

For Monika Richter, a former EU official specializing in disinformation
and current head of research at Semantic Visions, a Prague-based
intelligence firm, there\'s a disconnect between domestic propaganda,
which has focused on framing NATO as the enemy and Ukraine as a means to
obtaining security assurances from Washington, and the Kremlin\'s
foreign media operations, which have been more aggressive in claiming
that the West wants war in Eastern Europe.

\"[The outward disinformation campaign is rattling]{.underline},\" she
said. \"It [appears to be]{.underline} a [coordinated effort to lay the
groundwork ahead of another attack.\"]{.underline}

Chemical weapons and blaming NATO

Yet in recent days, specific themes have started to bubble to the
surface.

One relates to accusations --- mostly in non-English-language outlets
--- that either Ukraine or NATO could use chemical weapons within the
country in the hope of blaming Russia for it. These
[messages]{.underline} were then [picked up either by official
diplomatic accounts or American entities like SouthFront]{.underline}
--- a think tank the U.S. State Department has tied to the Kremlin ---
[and shared hundreds of times on social media]{.underline}, according to
POLITICO\'s analysis via CrowdTangle, a social media analytics tool
owned by Meta.

Another is that the West, not Russia, is the main driver in the
potential conflict.

Across RT and Sputnik --- in English, French, German and Spanish ---
reports highlighted how NATO countries had provided weapons to the
Ukrainian government, and claimed that U.S. President Joe Biden was
using the stand-off to boost his popularity at home. In multiple
reports, again heavily shared on social media, RT articles questioned
why the U.S. and Europe were supporting Ukraine when the COVID-19
pandemic was rife at home.

[Russian-backed media]{.underline} has [repeatedly captured significant
attention among Western audiences]{.underline}, particularly those in
Europe where [anti-American sentiment has risen since]{.underline}
[2016]{.underline}, according to the Pew Research Center. But [Kremlin
talking points also have seeped into mainstream U.S. media, particularly
promoted by]{.underline} right-wing influencers who have no affiliation
to Moscow and have tried to use the Ukrainian stand-off [to attack Biden
and his domestic agenda.]{.underline}

That includes raising questions about why Washington would enter the
conflict in the first place, concerns that U.S. involvement in Ukraine
could end similarly to what happened in Afghanistan, and calls for the
Biden administration to focus on domestic, not foreign, issues.

"There's an [alignment of interests between the U.S. far right and the
Russian government]{.underline}," said Schafer of the German Marshall
Fund. \"It\'s [exceptionally beneficial to have super]{.underline}
[mainstream U.S. voices parroting lines]{.underline} that [Russia has
been saying for years]{.underline}."

#### Ukraine creates a [tipping point]{.underline} in the [broader]{.underline} information war\-\--now's key 

Serge **Schmemman 22**, Times correspondent and bureau chief in Moscow,
Pulitzer Prize recipient, 5/5/2022, \"The Information War in Ukraine Is
Far From Over: Serge Schmemann,\"
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/opinion/russia-ukraine-propaganda.html>
, RMax

If the first casualty of war is truth, then the corollary [in
Ukraine]{.underline} is that [information is the first
battlefield]{.underline}.

That was where the war began, in early 2022, weeks before Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline} sent the first rockets, armored vehicles and troops
into Ukraine, when he [claimed]{.underline} that the massive [buildup of
troops]{.underline} along Ukraine's borders [was]{.underline} but
[another military exercise]{.underline}. And that was where the United
States and its allies scored their first victories, when they made
public intelligence anticipating the invasion and the pretext Mr. Putin
would use for it.

Then, when the invasion began in February, Ukraine's president,
Volodymyr [Zelensky, opened a second information front]{.underline}. He
donned a soldier's olive-drab T-shirt and issued a torrent of defiant
tweets, speeches and images from devastated villages, much of it
targeted at Russian audiences. [His metamorphosis from]{.underline} a
relatively [unpopular]{.underline} president [to a David defying Goliath
has been instrumental in solidifying popular]{.underline}, military and
economic [support]{.underline} for Ukraine in the United States and
Europe.

In these first information battles, the Americans and Ukrainians showed
that they had learned the lessons of 2014, when Russia had the upper
hand in propaganda, assaulting Crimea and eastern Ukraine while claiming
to be responding to pleas from Russian-speaking residents. The United
States and Ukraine have also been greatly aided this time around by the
fact that the evidence of the invasion and its brutal consequences has
been so well documented.

But [the information war]{.underline}, like the physical war, [is far
from decided]{.underline}. Ten weeks into the war, [many
Russians]{.underline} seem to [accept]{.underline} Mr. [Putin's
narrative]{.underline}. Around the world, [many countries remain on the
sidelines or, like China, are on Russia's side]{.underline}. While
[Washington's]{.underline} public [comments]{.underline} have served to
bolster the Ukrainians and rally their allies, [some]{.underline} of
those [comments have played directly into]{.underline} Mr. [Putin's
claims of a malign America]{.underline} determined to neuter Russia, as
when President Biden said of Mr. Putin, "This man cannot remain in
power," and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin declared that America's goal
is a "weakened" Russia.

[Russia]{.underline} was surprisingly slow to prepare its population or
the world for a full-scale invasion, perhaps because its leaders were
convinced that Kyiv would fall quickly. But after that slow start, the
Kremlin went into high gear. Domestically, it [shut down independent
media outlets, quashed demonstrations and threatened anyone challenging
the government line with "false information"]{.underline} about the
invasion with up to 15 years in prison.

[Russia was]{.underline} also [quick to adapt]{.underline} its
[messaging to a changing battlefield]{.underline}. After Moscow shifted
its focus from Kyiv to southeastern Ukraine, the [goal of driving Nazis
out of]{.underline} power in [Kyiv shifted to a focus on Ukraine as
a]{.underline}n existential [struggle]{.underline} for Holy Russia
[against]{.underline} an [American hegemon and]{.underline} its
[NATO]{.underline} sidekicks. What began as a "special military
operation" has morphed into a defensive war akin to World War II, the
"Great Patriotic War," in which Russia was last compelled to defend
itself against Nazis and fascists.

"We broke the back of fascism," declared Patriarch Kirill, the head of
the Russian Orthodox Church and a staunch supporter of the war against
Ukraine, in a sermon on April 3 that turned an unprovoked invasion into
a noble crusade. On May 3 he ratcheted up the language: "We don't want
to fight anyone," he said in a sermon in the Kremlin. "Russia has never
attacked anyone. It is amazing that a great and powerful country never
attacked anyone; it only defended its borders."

How many Russians really believe this is hard to gauge, given the danger
of disagreeing. There is [considerable]{.underline} anecdotal
[evidence]{.underline} that [the notions of a hostile NATO]{.underline}
and treacherous Ukrainians [are widely held, but there are
also]{.underline} many [reports of Russians horrified by the war but no
longer able to speak out without immediate repression.]{.underline}

[The info war has]{.underline} also [reached Asia, Africa and South
America, where Russia has mobilized diplomats and state-controlled
media]{.underline} like the global RT network [to press its case. The
goal is]{.underline}n't necessarily to win support, but [to keep
unaligned countries on the sidelines]{.underline}. While some
[countries]{.underline}, most notably China, have taken Russia's side,
others, like India, [have avoided antagonizing Russia]{.underline} so as
not to lose Russian military or energy contracts.

Many others have done so simply because they know and care little about
Ukraine. Russia's line to them is that it is fighting to prevent the
United States from creating a unipolar world that would swallow their
country, with no one to support their interests. The strategy evoked
memories of the assistance the Soviet Union gave to Vietnam, Angola and
other postcolonial independence movements.

The United States has mounted its own diplomatic efforts to gain more
support from countries like India and South Africa. And Ukraine recently
posted a video on Twitter recently in which the commander of Ukrainian
armed forces thanks 37 countries that, according to the tweet, have
shown "assistance and unwavering support in these hard times." The list
is not entirely fair --- some Asian countries missing from the list have
provided nonlethal assistance --- but it is still noteworthy that there
were no entries from Africa or South America.

As the war rages on, attention in the United States and elsewhere is
bound to flag, and questions about the impact of the war on energy and
food prices worldwide are bound to intensify. A speech by Mr. Biden on
Tuesday on the need to support Ukraine was lost in the brouhaha over the
leak of a Supreme Court draft ruling. And the \$33 billion he is seeking
in military assistance and other aid for Ukraine is certain to meet
resistance, especially since there is no idea when or how the war might
end.

[Dwindling Western commitment is part of]{.underline} Mr. [Putin's
calculus]{.underline}. Though he seems to have misjudged the West's fury
and response to his invasion, his 22 years of increasingly autocratic
rule have taught him that passions invariably wane and high costs erode
commitment.

[As]{.underline} a [former K.G.B.]{.underline} agent, Mr. [Putin sees
the world as a battleground of conspiratorial maneuvers]{.underline}. In
his speeches, the color revolutions in Ukraine and other former Soviet
republics and the Arab Spring and other global upheavals are
machinations to bolster American domination. As an heir to the Soviet
worldview, [he believes]{.underline} more than many Western leaders do
[in the importance of information warfare]{.underline}, both [to give
his regime a veneer of legitimacy and to challenge liberal
democracy]{.underline}. On this battlefield, lies are ammunition in Mr.
Putin's long and increasingly personal struggle to stay in power.

[As the war enters a new phase]{.underline}, as the images and horrors
become familiar and the costs rise, [it will become ever more difficult
for]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline} administration and for Mr.
Zelensky [to sustain their]{.underline} early [lead in the information
war]{.underline}. That makes it all the more imperative for the West to
press the message that this is not a war Ukraine chose and that the cost
of allowing Mr. Putin to have his way in Ukraine would be far higher
than the sacrifices required to block him.

The War on Liberal Democracy and Western Dominance

Amid new and continuing global issues and conflicts, [Russia wants to
remain at the forefront of the creation and implementation of possible
solutions]{.underline}. [[The Kremlin believes the U.S]{.mark}. and its
allies [are]{.mark} continuously [working to isolate Russia and
undermine Russian interests]{.mark}.]{.underline} These sentiments are
perfectly stated in the National Security Strategy of the Russian
Federation:

"The strengthening of Russia is taking place against a backdrop of new
threats to national security that are of a multifarious and
interconnected nature. The Russian Federation's implementation of an
independent foreign and domestic policy is giving rise to opposition
from the U.S. and its allies, who are seeking to retain their dominance
in world affairs. The policy of containing Russia that they are
implementing envisions the exertion of political, economic, military,
and informational pressure on it.\[21\]"

[[Russia's policy]{.mark} not only [communicates a
responsibility]{.mark} to protect its citizens and Russian culture, but
also [to combat the U.S.-led unipolar system]{.mark} and persuade others
to do the same.]{.underline}

In practice, [Russia uses this strategy to justify its operations
abroad]{.underline}. As an opponent of the U.S.-centric order, [Russia
paints itself as a sort of hero for those who are frustrated with the
U.S.-led unipolar system]{.underline}. The U.S. Senate 2018 report on
Russia's actions outlines the real objectives and asymmetric cyber
tactics of Putin's regime. It argues that the regime's overarching goal
is the protection of its own power and stability through the expansion
of Russian hegemony in various sectors.

[Analysis of known [Russian information operations]{.mark} in Western
democracies [illuminates three]{.mark} key overarching
[objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}: [[to discredit]{.mark} trusted
[democratic institutions, to divide the Western coalition, and to
undermine the]{.mark} supranational organizations that uphold and
promote these [democratic values]{.mark}.\[]{.underline}22\] Following a
short stint with democracy in the 1990's that coincided with national
embarrassment, soaring levels of poverty, widespread corruption, war,
and instability; [Putin has rebuilt the country without a vision of
democracy]{.underline}. Modern Russia provides a model for an
alternative form of governance, one that is focused on information
sovereignty, and promotes traditionalism, nationalism, and
authoritarianism. [Western ideals and democratic values naturally run
contrary to Putin's own more autocratic vision]{.underline}. [The
current international order]{.underline}, upheld by the U.S. and its
allies, is critical of modern Russia and united, [hinders Putin's
ability to implement his agenda at home and abroad]{.underline}.\[23\]
For this reason, the current international order is a constant hindrance
and security threat to Putin's form of government. In addition, Russia's
history of invasion from Western Europe motivates its distrust of the
west and of NATO's effect on global politics.\[24\]

In most Western democracies, [[racism]{.underline}]{.mark} and fears
about immigration [[create fertile ground for manipulation]{.underline}.
[These fears have been targeted by Russian information campaigns to sway
the outcome of elections]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[25\] European
democracies and the U.S. face all forms of information warfare and free
and fair elections are consistently targeted. [[Russia hopes to
radicalize the populace]{.mark} in these countries, [creating]{.mark}
not only [instability and polarization, but also weak
governments]{.mark}.]{.underline} Large supranational blocks such as the
EU can have a drastic impact on Russia's economy by implementing
sanctions and forming a collective front against potential military
action. For this reason, [a large part of Russia's overarching
international policy is focused on disrupting the unity between Western
democracies.]{.underline}\[26\]

#### European polarization cements [populism]{.underline}\-\--it's [robustly]{.underline} correlated

//AShah

[Our aim was to explain populist attitudes]{.underline} (that may
eventually lead to populist votes) [by a number of factors, the most
important being the degree of social polarization]{.underline}, which
measures the extent of social divides that plague our societies.
[[Polarization is]{.mark} [significantly positively correlated
with]{.mark} all four [populist attitudes]{.mark}]{.underline},
particularly when immigration inflows are treated as an endogenous
variable and the model is estimated using IV-2SLS. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to correlate populism using such
indicators of polarization that reflect the socioeconomic divides better
than standard measures of inequality or poverty.

To compute our measure of social polarization, in each country we
fractionalize population into three groups, low, middle and high income.
The distances between the income groups are the ratios of people
experiencing either difficulties 'to make ends meet,' or 'material
deprivation'.

We show that [[social polarization varies dramatically across
Europe]{.mark}an regions]{.underline}. The highest scores are found in
Southern and Eastern countries and the lowest scores in Northern
countries, but at the same time, some convergence is observed. Our
estimations confirm, in most cases, [[a positive]{.mark} and
statistically [significant relation between social polarization and
populist attitudes.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Furthermore, our results confirm the effect of immigration inflows on
populist attitudes. The only exception, unexpectedly, is the effect of
immigration on anti-immigration values. We find however a positive and
statistically significant relation when testing our model for the
younger European age-cohorts.

Summing up, [social polarization appears as a key determinant of
populist attitudes among Europeans]{.underline}, but there is also an
anti-immigration effect. These results may appear to contradict the view
that economic factors only account for a limited portion in individuals'
populist attitudes and votes (Margalit 2019).22 We think that this is
not the case in our study. [[Social polarization]{.mark} must not be
considered as an economic variable per se, but [also as a measure of
potential tensions and conflicts within the society]{.mark}. As such,
[it drives populist attitudes and values like distrust of
institutions]{.mark}, distrust of others, anti-immigration, and
authoritarianism.]{.underline}

#### EU populism spills over globally

David **Cadier 19**, researcher in EU foreign policy at CERI-Sciences
Po, Associate at LSE IDEAS (London School of Economics) and a Future
World Fellow at the Centre for the Governance of Change (IE University),
January 2019, \"How Populism Spills Over Into Foreign Policy,\" Carnegie
Europe, https://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/78102 //AShah

Even more than mainstream parties, [populist leaders in office seem to
regard foreign policy as the continuation of domestic politics by other
means]{.underline}. Because they consider themselves as the only true
representatives of the people, populist actors discard any political
opposition as necessarily illegitimate, with repercussions on foreign
policy.

Taking the opposite course of their predecessors seems, for instance, a
key reference point in setting the coordinates of their foreign policy.
This is perhaps best exemplified by Donald Trump's apparent obsession
with unbundling Barack Obama's diplomatic initiatives.

This also means that under populist leadership domestic political
infightings are more likely to take precedence over diplomatic
considerations. [Warsaw not only stood out as the only EU member state
to oppose the reelection of former Polish prime minister Donald Tusk at
the helm of the European Council; its foreign minister actually
denounced the election as being rigged.]{.underline}

Rather than competing with a political opposition, [populist leaders
claim to fight enemies operating from the shadows, both at home and
abroad.]{.underline} This is in part because being elected to office and
becoming, themselves, the country's governing elite risks undermining
their core antiestablishment message.

To elude this contradiction, populists in power often castigate members
of the old elite as being still active behind the scenes. This
allegation can then be invoked to purge the civil service, as happened
with the Ministry of culture of Croatia. And this has also led populist
leaders to indulge in conspiracy theories, even from top policymaking
positions. [In the summer of 2017, former Polish defense minister Antoni
Macierewicz depicted the protests against his government's reform of the
justice system as the manifestation of a hybrid war being waged against
Poland.]{.underline}

Overall, to refer back to Matteo Salvini's expression, populists in
office have not brought about thus far a "revolution" in their country's
foreign policy. Hungary has not put into question its NATO membership.
Italy has not vetoed the renewal of EU sanctions against Russia. And
Poland seems to have reverted to the kind of America First policy it had
followed when George W. Bush was in the White House.

But populists do not seem to bring much distinctive common sense to the
table either. Contrary to sensationalist claims, they do not necessarily
adopt devil-may-care attitudes in international affairs. Yet their
diplomacy is often crippled by the collateral damage of their radical
approach to domestic politics. And this is likely to have both direct
and indirect implications for EU external action.

[First, it might affect the substance of EU foreign policy]{.underline}.
The EU has largely based its foreign policy on the promotion of norms
and standards of democratic governance, particularly in its
neighborhood. [The fact that some member states, such as Hungary and
Poland, put these norms and standards into question domestically risks
weakening the EU's legitimacy in exporting them.]{.underline}

More concretely, [the instrumentalization of migration issues in
populist parties' domestic political strategies has impacted the common
EU asylum and migration policy]{.underline}---or rather a lack of one.
Several member states have conveniently hidden behind the uncompromising
posture of Viktor Orbán. [The growing number of EU capitals announcing
that they will not ratify the UN Global Compact on migration is the
latest example of this ripple effect.]{.underline}

[Second, it is likely to affect the process of EU foreign
policy]{.underline}. By [overprioritizing domestic politics and showing
a proclivity for "undiplomatic" diplomacy, as well as conspiracy
theories, governing populist parties risk complicating even further
consensus-seeking and compromise-building]{.underline}. On these depends
EU member states' ability to act collectively. And this risk will be
even more acute if mainstream parties seek to co-opt the ideas and
emulate the rhetoric of populist actors for electoral gains---as they
did in the realm of migration policies.

In short, the implications of the rise of populism for Europe's foreign
policy should neither be exaggerated nor ignored. [They are already
salient in some member states and might be reinforced by the results of
the European Parliament elections.]{.underline}

#### Populism's an [independent]{.underline} existential risk [and]{.underline} magnifies all others 

Andrew **Leigh 21**, Australian member of Parliament, former professor
of economics at the Australian National University, 2021, What\'s the
Worst That Could Happen?: Existential Risk and Extreme Politics,
unpaginated ebook version

How likely is it that humanity could end? Experts working on
catastrophic risk have estimated the chances of disaster for a wide
range of the hazards that our species faces. Adding up the threats,
philosopher Toby Ord estimates the odds that [[humanity could become
extinct]{.underline}]{.mark} over the next century at one in six,
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} an [out-of-control [superintelligence,
bioterror]{.mark}ism, and [totalitarianism]{.mark} among the largest
risks]{.underline}. He argues that most of the risks have arisen because
technology has advanced more rapidly than safeguards to keep it in
check. To encapsulate the situation facing humanity, Ord titled his book
The Precipice.

A one in six chance of going the way of dodos and dinosaurs effectively
means [we are playing a game of Russian roulette with humanity's
future]{.underline}. Six chambers. One bullet. Even the most foolhardy
soldier usually finds an excuse not to play Russian roulette. And that's
when just their own life is at stake. In considering extinction risk,
we're contemplating not one fatality but the death of billions or
possibly trillions of people---not to mention countless animals.

It can seem impossible to [imagine our species becoming extinct due to a
catastrophe such as [nuclear war, asteroids]{.mark}, or [a
pandemic]{.mark}]{.underline}. But in reality, [the danger surpasses
plenty of perils we already worry about]{.underline}. One way to put
catastrophic risk into perspective is to compare it with more familiar
risks. If extinction risk poses a one in six risk to our species over
the next century, then it means that it is far more hazardous than many
everyday risks. Specifically, it suggests that the typical US resident
is fifteen times more likely to die from a catastrophic risk---such as
nuclear war or bioterrorism---than in car crash.2

[Extinction risk outstrips other dangers]{.underline} too. Ask people
about their greatest fears, and you'll get answers like "street
violence," "snakes," "heights," and "terrorism.\"4 But in reality, these
are much less hazardous than catastrophic risks. People in the United
States are 31 times more likely to die from a catastrophic risk than
from homicide. Catastrophic risk is 3,519 times likelier to kill than
falls from a height, and 6,194 times more likely to kill than venomous
plants and animals. If you have ever worried about any of these threats,
you should be more fearful about cata- strophic risk. Extinction risks
aren't just more dangerous than any of them; they are more hazardous
than all of them put together. Catastrophic risk poses a greater danger
to the life of the typical US resident than car accidents, murder,
drowning, high falls, electrocution, and rattlesnakes put together.

A one in six risk is just the danger in a single century. Suppose that
the risk of extinction remains at one in six for each century. That
means there's a five in six chance humanity makes it to the end of the
twenty-first century, but less than an even chance we survive to the end
of the twenty-fourth century. The odds that we survive all the way to
the year 3000 are just one in six. In other words, if we continue
playing Russian roulette once a century, it's probable that we blow our
brains out before the millennium is halfway through, and there's only a
small chance that we make it to the end of the millennium.

Part of the reason humans undervalue the future is that it's hard to get
our heads around the idea that our genetic code could live on for
millions of years. At present, the best estimates are that our species,
Homo sapiens, evolved around three hundred thousand years ago.1 That
means we have existed for about ten thousand generations. But [we have
another one billion years before the increasing heat of our sun brings
most plant life to an end]{.underline}.1 [That's plenty of time to
figure out how to become an interstellar species and move to a more
suitable solar system]{.underline}. Humans could live to enjoy another
thirty million generations on earth.

Thinking about the mind-boggling scale of these numbers, I'm reminded of
the Total Perspective Vortex machine, created by Douglas Adams in The
Restaurant at the End of the Universe. Anyone brave enough to enter sees
a scale model of the entire universe, with an arrow indicating their
current position. As a result, their brain explodes. As Adams reflects,
the machine proves that "if life is going to exist in a universe of this
size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of
proportion."

Still, let's try. Imagine your ancestors a hundred generations ago. They
are your great-great-great-great-great-great-great-

great-great-great-grandparents. These people lived around 1000 BCE, at
the start of the Iron Age. They might have been part of Homeric Greece,
ancient Egypt, Vedic age India, the preclassic Maya, or Zhou Dynasty
China.

Contemplate for a moment about what the hundred genera- tions between
our Iron Age ancestors and today have achieved. They built the Taj Mahal
and Sistine Chapel, the Angkor Wat and Empire State Building. Thanks to
them, we can relish the poetry of Maya Angelou, novels of Leo Tolstoy,
and music of Ludwig van Beethoven. An abundance of inventions has
delivered us deli- cious food, homes that are comfortable year-round,
and technol- ogy that provides online access to a bottomless well of
entertain- ment. If time machines existed, we might pop in to visit our
great100 grandparents, but few would volunteer to stay in the Iron Age.

Yet humanity is really just getting started. If things go well, it's ten
thousand generations down, thirty million to go. Imagine what those
future generations could do, and how much time they have to enjoy.
Here's one way to think about what it means to have thirty million
generations ahead. Suppose humanity's potential time on the planet was
shrunk down to a single eighty- year life span. In that event, we would
now be a newborn baby--- just nine days old. Homo sapiens is a mere 0.03
percent through all we could experience on earth.

We won't meet most of those who follow us on the planet, but we should
cherish future generations all the same. If you value humanity's past
achievements---the Aztec and Roman civiliza- tions, art of the
Renaissance, and breakthroughs of the Industrial Revolution---then the
generations to come are just as worthy. This is what political
philosopher Edmund Burke meant when he described society as "a
partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who
are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born.'- To
appreciate the past is akin to admiring the achievements of distant
places. Like geography, his- tory helps us better understand the way of
the world.

Politicians like me like to speak fondly about looking after \"our
children and our grandchildren." But it usually stops after a generation
or two. Policy pays little heed to the many generations that will
follow. For my own part, it took a coronavirus-induced shutdown to have
the time to spend reflecting deeply about the long term. This book had
been rattling around in my head for years, but it was only when all my
meetings, events, and travel were canceled that I had the time to write
it. Pandemics are one of the threats to humanity that I'll discuss in
this book, but in this instance, it provided a chance to reflect on the
long term. It's tempting to ignore the distant future. It's easier to
love the grandchildren whom we hug than the great-great-great-grand-
children whom we'll never get to smile on. But that doesn't make those
far-flung generations any less important. Via my wife, our children can
trace their lineage to Benjamin Franklin, but I'm more excited about the
potential achievements of the generations yet to be born.

For companies and governments, [a major impediment to long- term
thinking is the idea of discounting the future]{.underline}. When
investing money, this is a reasonable approach. A dollar in a decade's
time is less valuable than a dollar today for the simple reason that a
dollar today could be invested and earn a real return. Share markets
have good and bad years, but based on returns from the past 120 years,
someone who put \$1,000 into the US stock market for an average year
could expect it to be worth \$1,065 after twelve months (accounting for
dividends and inflation).2 Approximating these returns, when governments
contemplate making investments, they often apply a discount rate of
around 5 percent, while companies use rates that are higher still.2

When it comes to growing your greenbacks, this makes perfect sense. If
Kanesha offered you \$ 1,000 today, and Jane offered you \$ 1,000 in a
year's time, most of us would think that Kanesha was making the more
generous offer. Kanesha's cash can be put to productive use and would be
worth more than Jane's when the year is out.

But what if we're talking about Kanesha and Jane themselves? Suppose
Kanesha is alive today, and Jane is yet to be born. When discounting is
applied to lives, it suggests that Kanesha's life to- day is worth twice
as much as Jane's life in fifteen years' time. It implies that Kanesha
today is worth 132 times as much as Jane in a century's time. So if
we're spending money to keep them safe, a 5 percent discount rate
indicates that we should spend more than a hundred times as much to
protect Kanesha today than to pro- tect Jane in a century's time.

The further we stretch the time period, the more ridiculous the results
become. Discounting at a rate of 5 percent implies that Christopher
Columbus is worth more than all eight billion people on the planet
today.--- Naturally, it also implies that your life is worth more than
eight billion lives in five hundred years' time. Even if you value the
hug of a loved one over the unseen successes of next century's
generations, is it fair to ruthlessly dis- miss the distant future?
Discounting is the enemy of the long term.

As philosopher Will MacAskill points out, there is something morally
repugnant about concluding that the happiness of those who will be alive
in the 2100s is inconsequential simply because they live in the future.
MacAskill coined the term "presentism" to refer to prejudice against
people who are yet unborn." Just like racism, sexism, or other forms of
bigotry, he argues that mis- treating those who live a long way in the
future is unfair. To dis- criminate in favor of Kanesha against unborn
Jane is a form of presentism. If you traveled back in time to the 1500s
and met someone who claimed that they were worth more than everyone
alive in the 2000s, you'd rightly regard them as an egomaniac. Isn't it
equally narcissistic to ignore the happiness of people in the 2500s?

Some have contended that we should favor the living over the unborn for
the same reason that philanthropy favors the down- trodden over the
wealthy. If incomes rise over time, the argument goes, then asking
today's citizens to help those in the future is like taking from the
poor to give to the rich.--- But this reasoning ignores the fact that we
are talking about the survival of future generations. Theoretical riches
won't do them any good if they are practically dead---or if planetary
apocalypse snuffs out their chance to be born. Similarly, it misses the
possibility that future pandemics, wars, or climate disasters could make
coming genera- tions significantly poorer.---

Insights from behavioral science help explain why [humans aren't good at
understanding extinction risk]{.underline}.--- [Our [thinking about
dangers is skewed by]{.mark} an "[availability bias]{.mark}": a tendency
to focus on familiar risks]{.underline}. Like the traders who failed to
forecast the collapse of the securitized housing debt market, [we are
lousy at judging the probability of rare but catastrophic
events]{.underline}. Most important, [our instincts fail us as the
magnitudes grow larger]{.underline}. In research titled \"The More Who
Die, the Less We Care," psychologists Paul Slovic and Daniel Vastfjall
argue that we become numb to suffering as the body count grows.---
Humans' compassionate instincts are aroused by stories, not statistics.
Indeed, one study found that people were more likely to donate to help a
single victim than they were to assist eight victims. This may help
explain why the international community has been so slow to respond to
genocide, including recent incidents in Rwanda, Darfur, and Myanmar. As
artificial intelligence researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky notes, human
neurotransmitters are unable to feel sorrow that is thousands of times
stronger than a single funeral.--- The problem is starker still when it
comes to extinction risk. Our emotional brains cannot multiply by
billions.

Add to this a media cycle that has become a media cyclone, in which
stories explode in a matter of minutes, and "outrage porn" seems to
drive the news choices of many outlets. In the 2016 US election,
researchers found that for every piece of professional news shared on
Twitter, there was one piece of "junk news.''--- Conflict fueled by
social media keeps us in a primal state of rage and retaliation. And
this isn't the only force that makes politics myopic. Campaign
contributions tend to come from donors who have an immediate interest in
a "today" issue rather than from people aiming to solve long-term
problems. This kind of "instant noodle" politics prioritizes quick
results and sidelines fundamental challenges.

[[In this environment]{.mark}, a special style of politics has thrived:
populism]{.underline}. The term "populist\" gets thrown around a
lot---typically as an insult---so it's worth taking a moment to define
it precisely.--- [[Populists see politics as a conflict between]{.mark}
crooked [elites and the]{.mark} pure mass of
[people]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many candidates trying to defeat an
incumbent will criticize "insiders," but [populists make a stronger
attack on elites, claiming that they are dishonest or corrupt. Populists
then claim that they---and only they---represent the "real
people]{.underline}." Populists combine a fierce critique of elites and
personal appeal to the "silent majority."

[The political strategy of [populists]{.mark} involves
[critiq]{.mark}uing intellectuals, [institutions, and
internationalism]{.mark}. The political style of populists tends to be
fierce]{.underline}. They do not strive for unity and calm consensus.
Populists share with revolutionaries a desire for sudden and dramatic
change. [They [have little respect for experts and]{.mark} the
[systems]{.mark} of government]{.underline}. Populists' priorities tend
to be immediate issues such as crime, migration, jobs, and taxes.
Consequently, the [electoral [success]{.mark} of populists has served to
[sideline work on]{.mark} long-term dangers such as [climate change and
nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Donald [Trump]{.underline} may have [lost]{.underline} his presidential
reelection bid, [but]{.underline} he has [transformed the Republican
Party]{.underline}, which has jettisoned its longstanding commitment to
free trade, immigration, and global alliances. Many moderate
Republicans, who might have served comfortably under Ronald Reagan or
George H. W. Bush, have quit the party or been defeated by
Trump-supporting populists. The Republican Party, which holds nearly
half the seats in Congress and controls a majority of state
legislatures, has embraced populism to a degree that was unimaginable
when it was led by George W. Bush, John McCain, or Mitt Romney. After
four years under President Trump, the Republican Party is now more
cynical and isolationist, focused on immediate grievances rather than
long-term challenges.

Yet [while the strength of populism threatened to sideline issues of
catastrophic risk, coronavirus did the opposite]{.underline}. The worst
pandemic in a century led to the most severe economic crisis since the
Great Depression. Churches and concert halls fell silent. International
travel collapsed. The Summer Olympics were postponed. Stocks plunged,
and for a brief moment, the price of a barrel of oil went negative.
Globally, millions lost their jobs, and millions more faced famine.

[COVID-19 never threatened to extinguish humanity, but it highlighted
our vulnerability to infectious diseases]{.underline}. More than at any
time in living memory, people focused on the dangers of pandemics. The
popularity of Geraldine Brooks's Year of Wonders, Stephen King's The
Stand, Emily St. John Mandel's Station Eleven, and Albert Camus's The
Plague vividly illustrates the way in which fear of pandemics has become
more acute.

We know that disasters can remake society. The black death helped usher
in the Renaissance.--- The Great Depression made a generation of
investors more risk averse.--- World War II spawned the United Nations
and formed the modern welfare state. In autocracies, droughts and floods
can topple dictators.---

Coronavirus is reshaping the world in numerous ways.--- Handwashing is
in. Cheek kissing is out. The rise of big cities is slowing as people
consider the downsides of density. Firms that automated their production
systems to deal with physical dis- tancing requirements and stay-at-home
orders are discovering that they can get by permanently with fewer
staff. More tele- working and less business travel is leading to a drop
in demand for receptionists, bus drivers, office cleaners, and security
guards. When it comes to our use of technology, coronavirus suddenly
accelerated the world to 2030. When it comes to globalization, the
pandemic took us back to 2010.

[But it's still an open question as to how COVID-19 will affect
humanity's ability to think about the long term]{.underline}. Most of
the examples I've listed are instances in which crises affected
societies organically: the shock came, and it changed our behavior. But
[accentuating the long term requires taking risk more seriously and
placing greater emphasis on saving our species]{.underline}. Linebackers
are swift to respond when an offensive player suddenly takes a step to
the right. But it takes longer to recognize that a team's offensive
plays are skewed to the right and modify the defensive formation
accordingly.

Like a football team that adapts its tactics, this book argues that we
should lengthen our thinking. At minimal cost, society can massively
reduce the odds of catastrophe. By ensuring that the big threats get the
attention and resources they need, we can safeguard the future of our
species. As insurance policies go, this one is a bargain.

In the chapters that follow, I'll outline [[the biggest risks]{.mark}
facing humanity]{.underline}. I'll begin in chapter 2 with pandemics,
[[such as]{.underline}]{.mark} the possibility that [the [next
virus]{.mark} might [combine]{.mark} the [infectiousness]{.mark} of
COVID-19 [with]{.mark} the [deadliness]{.mark} of Ebola]{.underline}.
What can we do to shut down exotic animal markets, speed up vaccine
develop- ment, and create surge capacity in hospitals? I'll then delve
into [bioterrorism, and]{.underline} the [danger of [extremists
developing]{.mark} their own [versions of]{.mark} smallpox or the
bubonic [plague]{.mark}]{.underline}. How difficult is it for them to
create these devilish diseases, and what can we do to prevent it?

In chapter 3, I'll then explore [[climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}---perhaps the in- tergenerational issue that
has received the most public attention in recent years. While much of
the modeling looks at how global warming [could be]{.underline} bad, my
focus is on the chances that it's [catastrophic]{.underline}. This isn't
about climate change shortening the ski season; it's about the
possibility of temperatures rising by 18°F (10°C), [[rendering]{.mark}
large sections of [the planet uninhabitable]{.mark}]{.underline}. What
does the risk of cataclysmic climate change mean for energy policy?

Next, I'll turn to nukes. As a child in the 1980s, I vividly re- member
watching The Day After. My classmates and I agreed that a nuclear war
was inevitable. When the Cold War ended, the world seemed safer, but in
the three decades since, the [threat from [new nuclear powers]{.mark}
has made the problem less predictable]{.underline}. As I discuss in
chapter 4, [what we used to call an arms race now looks more like a bar
fight, [with hazards]{.mark} coming from unexpected directions,
[including]{.mark} terrorist groups]{.underline}. Yet just as there are
practical ways to avoid pub brawls (don't drink past midnight, avoid the
stairs, look out for the glass), so too are there [sensible
strategies]{.underline} that [can reduce the odds of [nuclear
catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline} (adopt a "no first use\" policy, reduce
the stockpiles, control loose nukes).

A [[superintelligence]{.mark} has been dubbed the "last invention" we'll
ever make]{.underline}. An [a]{.underline}rtificial
[i]{.underline}ntelligence machine [whose abilities exceed our own
[could]{.mark}]{.underline} turbocharge productivity and living stan-
dards. But it could also [[spell disaster]{.underline}]{.mark}. If we
program our artificial intelligence to maximize human happiness, it
could fulfill our wishes literally by immobilizing everyone and
attaching electrodes to the pleasure centers of our brains. As chapter 5
notes, what makes artificial intelligence different from every other
risky technology is its runaway potential. [Once a superintelligence can
improve itself, it is unstoppable]{.underline}. So [we need to build the
guardrails before the highway]{.underline}.

What are the odds? In chapter 6,1 complete the discussion of
catastrophic danger by examining less risky risks, including asteroids
and supervolcanoes. I [also consider]{.underline} the prospect of
"[[unknown unknowns]{.underline}]{.mark}." For example, prior to the
first atomic bomb test, some scientists thought there was a chance it
could set the atmosphere on fire, destroying the planet. When the Large
Hadron Collider was being built, critics warned that the particle
collisions inside it could create micro black holes. Although neither
situation eventuated, they raise the question of what [other doomsday
scenarios [could be lurking]{.mark} around the corner]{.underline}. How
should the prospect of these unexpected risks change our approach to
cutting-edge science? Drawing together these dangers with the major
hazards, I report the likely probability of each, benchmarking
existential risks such as nuclear war and pandemics against individual
risks such as being struck by lightning or dying on the battlefield.

Ultimately, [[tackling ex]{.mark}istential [risks is a political
problem]{.mark}]{.underline}. Private citizens can achieve many things,
but [preventing nuclear war, averting bioterrorism, and curbing
greenhouse emissions are]{.underline} fundamentally [problems of
government]{.underline}. Governments control the military, levy taxes,
and provide public goods. So [the [values]{.mark} of those who run the
country [will determine]{.mark} how much of a priority the nation places
on averting catastrophe]{.underline}.

[That's why the [rise of populists is crucial to humanity's]{.mark}
long- term [survival]{.mark}]{.underline}. In chapter 7,1 discuss the
factors that have led to the electoral success of populists during
recent decades, and why [[populists tend to be uninterested in]{.mark}
dealing with [long-term threats]{.mark}. Populists' focus on the short
term means]{.underline} that---like a driver distracted by a back seat
squabble---[we're in danger of missing the threats that could kill
us]{.underline}. I'll explore why populists around the world struggled
to respond to COVID-19, and what this says about the dangers that
populism poses to our species. [Most critics of populism have
concentrated on the present day. They're missing the bigger picture.
Populists are primarily endangering the unborn]{.underline}.

[[Bad politics doesn't just exacerbate other dangers]{.mark}; it
represents [a risk factor in itself through]{.mark} the possibility of
[a totalitarian turn]{.mark}]{.underline} ---[in which democracy is
replaced by an enduring autocracy]{.underline}. The road to democracy is
not a one-way street. Over the centuries, dozens of countries have
backslid from democracy into autocracy ---abandoning the institutions of
fair elections, protection for minorities, and free expression. Such an
outcome could be deadly for dissenters and miserable for the multitudes.
Chapter 8 explores why democracy dies and identifies the signs that
institutions are being undermined. Chapter 9 suggests how we might
strengthen democracies to allow citizens to have a greater say, and
lower the chances of the few taking over from the many. Chapter 10
concludes the book.

When COVID-19 hit, many rushed out to buy life insurance.--- In our
personal lives, we know that spending a small amount on insurance can
guard against financial ruin. Societies can take a similar approach:
implementing modest measures today to safe- guard the immense future of
our species. [For each of the existential risks we face, there are
sensible approaches that could curtail the dangers]{.underline}. For all
the risks we face, a better politics will lead to a safer world.

[Because of its focus on the urgent over the important, populist
politics should]{.underline} perhaps [bear the label, "Warning: populism
can harm your children]{.underline}.\" But [what is [the
alternative?]{.mark}]{.underline} In the conclusion, I argue that the
answer lies in the ancient philosophy of stoicism. [A stoic approach to
politics [isn't about favoring one side]{.mark} of the ideological fence
over another. Instead, [it's about]{.mark} the temperament of good
political leadership]{.underline}. Stoicism emphasizes that character
matters and holds that virtue is the only good. [[Decisions]{.mark} are
[based on]{.mark} empirical [ev]{.mark}idence, [not emotion]{.mark}.
Anger has no place in effective leadership]{.underline}. Strength comes
from civility, courage, and endurance. Stoics make a sharp distinction
between the things they can change and those they cannot.

Armed insurgency, [[Russia\'s main]{.mark} kinetic [HW]{.mark}
[tool]{.mark} against Ukraine, [was instigated and backed by massive
information warfare]{.mark} since it\'s inception.]{.underline} The
rebels, who are mostly mobilized, trained, and armed by the Russian
special services, and further supported by the Russian armed forces,
have been destabilizing Donetsk and Luhansk regions since February 2014.
The crisis started to unfold after the pro-Russian former president
Yanukovich was forced to flee to Russia as a result of the revolutionary
rally in Kiev over his decision to hinder Ukraine\'s association with
the EU. The mass protests in Kiev\'s Maidan Square, which brought the
new pro-European government to power, demonstrated the unequivocal
support of the vast majority - 90% according to some polls - of the
Western Ukrainians for European integration (IRI, 2014). In response to
the undesired change of the government in Ukraine (GoU), [[Russia
launched an aggressive information campaign blaming the government
for]{.mark} alleged [violations of the rights of the Russian speaking
minorities]{.mark} in the country.]{.underline} [[Using this
narrative]{.mark}, predominantly [Russian-speaking Crimea was officially
annexed by Russia, and Russian special services started to organize
separatist outbreaks in Donbas.]{.mark}]{.underline} For these purposes,
Russia used the dissatisfaction of the Russian speaking Ukrainians with
the new government\'s attempt to drop the law making Russian the
official second language of Ukraine.

Notably, the linguistic divide between the population of the western and
eastern regions of Ukraine is reflected in political preferences on the
part of the population. According to the opinion polls conducted by the
Kiev\'s International Institute of Sociology, 72.5% of the population of
Donetsk region are in favor of integration of Ukraine into the
Russian-led Customs Union as opposed to the 9.4% supporting EU
integration (Zn. ua, 2014). The regional differences with regard to
foreign policy orientation, also stimulated and well exploited by
Russian propaganda, can be seen as the main source of the political
disagreement between eastern and western Ukraine. [[As a result of
effective information warfare conducted by Russia and the pro-Russian
separatists on the ground, they were able to manipulate]{.mark} with the
divides among the population against Ukraine\'s integration into the
European and Euro-Atlantic [structures by provoking violent conflict in
Donbas without even having mass support.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Remarkably, unlike Ukraine, there has never been a significant Russian
native speaking or ethnic minority in Georgia. According to the 2002
census published by the European Center for Minority Issues, there is a
total of 1.5% Russians living on the territory of Georgia (EUMM, 2014).
Therefore, to rationalize the narrative of protecting Russians abroad,\'
Moscow has since 2002 mass distributed Russian passports in both
occupied regions of Georgia. According to various media sources,
accepting Russian citizenship was mandatory for permanent residents in
the occupied territories and was forcefully executed by local police
units. In other words, as opposed to Ukrainian case, where Russia used
existing linguistic divides to instigate separatism, in Georgia it
created artificial citizens through an illegal "passportization\'
process in order to justify the 2008 invasion of Georgia. The narrative
that was used by Kremlin to justify the aggression after the 5 days war
was blaming Georgia for initiating the conflict by using force against
Russian citizens in Tskhinvaly region, thus compelling Russia to respond
with the "peace enforcement\" operation. [This analysis is very
important to once again underscore that [smaller and weaker states
failed to deter realization of obvious patterns of Kremlin\'s HW]{.mark}
and counter its strategic narratives, such as the right to protect
interests of Russians abroad.]{.underline} As evidenced in both Ukraine
and Georgia[, [Russia is using a new type of H]{.mark}ybrid
[W]{.mark}arfare [to achieve its goals through controlling proxies on
the ground supported by the massive information
warfare]{.mark}.]{.underline} In both cases
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, without having solid grounds, [[succeeded
to materialize aggression]{.mark} through engineering new realities,
[which constitute dangerous precedents that]{.mark} [can be]{.mark}
repeatedly [used against]{.mark} Georgia and [other vulnerable
countries]{.mark} in future.]{.underline}

//AShah

[[We're Focused on Ukraine But Look Out For the Russian Threat to the
Baltics]{.underline}]{.mark}: It was a shot heard around the world in
the Russian military analysis community. A RAND Corporation simulated
wargame in 2016 concluded that the Russian military could reach the
suburbs of the Estonian and Latvian capitals of Tallinn and Riga in less
than 60 hours. In the iterations of the exercise, the Estonians and
Latvians would need at least seven brigades of troops that include at
least three armored brigades to potentially fight the Russians to a
standstill.

But it gets worse from here. In another RAND wargame in 2019, the
players examined if NATO and Russia would use tactical nuclear weapons
during a simulated war in the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania). The scenario also had Russian conventional forces
over-running capitals in the Balkans and NATO having the last fail-safe
option to use non-strategic nuclear weapons.

What Type of Warfare Could the Russians Use Against the Baltics?

A widespread fear is that [[the Kremlin could use hybrid
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} (conventional and unconventional aspects of
power projection) [again [to annex parts of the
Baltics]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [which would trigger Article V with NATO
allies]{.underline}]{.mark} and would require a military response
against the Russians from NATO members. A glance at a map will tell you
that St. Petersburg is dangerously close to Tallinn, Estonia and Riga,
Latvia. But according to General Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of the
General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia, [the distinctions between
offensive aspects of war and defensive aspects of war are
blurring.]{.underline}

Under this Gerasimov Doctrine, [[the Kremlin then could engineer a
Russian]{.mark} hybrid [incursion]{.mark} of cyber and [information
warfare attacks against the Baltics]{.mark}, and [these tactics could
be]{.mark} made to be [seen as a defensive
operation.]{.mark}]{.underline} Since the Baltics have ethnic Russians
as part of the population, [[Moscow could employ special operations
forces]{.mark} as peacekeepers [to protect
compatriots.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[This could happen with an
information warfare campaign that would increase]{.mark} the chances for
[protest]{.mark} and other domestic unrest [with ethnic Russians as
victims]{.mark} in the Baltics. [Then a hybrid operation would ensue to
protect ethnic Russians.]{.mark}]{.underline}

According to the two RAND sets of wargames, [[the Russians would then
bring in the]{.mark} heavy armored and mechanized [infantry]{.mark}
units [to "teach the Baltics a lesson."]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Baltic invasion goes [nuclear]{.underline}.

//AShah

Would the US fight a nuclear war to save Estonia? The question would
probably strike most Americans as absurd. Certainly, almost no one was
thinking about such a prospect when NATO expanded to include the Baltic
states back in 2004.

Yet a series of reports by the nonpartisan RAND Corporation shows that
[[the possibility of nuclear escalation in a conflict between]{.mark}
the [N]{.mark}orth [A]{.mark}tlantic [T]{.mark}reaty
[O]{.mark}rganization [and Russia over the Baltic]{.mark} region [is
high]{.mark}]{.underline}er than one might imagine. The best way of
averting it? Invest more in the alliance's conventional defense.

There was a time when it seemed quite normal to risk nuclear war over
the sanctity of European frontiers. During the Cold War, NATO was
outnumbered by Warsaw Pact forces, and it would have had great
difficulty stopping a Soviet attack with conventional weapons. [From the
moment it was formed, NATO relied on the threat of nuclear escalation
--- whether rapid and spasmodic, or gradual and controlled --- to
maintain deterrence.]{.underline} American thinkers developed elaborate
models and theories of deterrence. [US and NATO forces regularly carried
out exercises simulating the resort to nuclear weapons to make this
strategy credible.]{.underline}

[After the Cold War ended, the US and its allies had the luxury of
thinking less about nuclear deterrence and war-fighting.]{.underline}
Tensions with Russia receded and nuclear strategy came to seem like a
relic of a bygone era. [Yet today, [with Russia rising again as a
military threat, the]{.mark} grim [logic of nuclear statecraft is
returning.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The spike in tensions between Russia and the West over the past
half-decade has revealed a basic problem: [[NATO doesn't have the
capability to prevent Russia]{.mark}n forces [from]{.mark} quickly
[overrunning Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[Russian invaders would be at the gates of the Baltic capitals in two to
three days; existing NATO forces in the region would be destroyed or
swept aside. NATO could respond by mobilizing for a longer war to
liberate the Baltic countries, but this would require a bloody,
dangerous military campaign. Critically, that campaign would require
striking targets --- such as air defense systems --- located within
Russia itself, as well as suppressing Russian artillery, short-range
missiles and other capabilities within the Kaliningrad enclave, which is
situated behind NATO's front lines.]{.underline}

Moreover, this sort of NATO counteroffensive is precisely the situation
Russian nuclear doctrine seems meant to avert. [[Russian officials
understand that their country would lose a long war against
NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline} They are particularly alarmed at the
possibility of NATO using its unmatched military capabilities to conduct
conventional strikes within Russian borders. So [[the Kremlin has
signaled that it might carry out limited nuclear
strikes]{.underline}]{.mark} --- perhaps a "demonstration strike"
somewhere in the Atlantic, or against NATO forces in the theater ---
[[to force the alliance to make peace]{.mark} on Moscow's
terms.]{.underline} This concept is known as "escalate to de-escalate,"
and there is a growing body of evidence that the Russians are serious
about it.

A [[NATO-Russia war could]{.mark} thus [go nuclear if Russia "escalates"
to preserve the gains it has won early in the conflict.]{.mark} [It
could also go nuclear]{.mark} in a second,]{.underline} if somewhat less
likely, way: [[If the U.S. and NATO initiate their own limited nuclear
strikes against Russian forces to prevent Moscow from overrunning the
Baltic allies in the first place]{.underline}.]{.mark} And even the
limited use of nuclear weapons raises the question of further
escalation: [Would [crossing the nuclear threshold lead]{.mark}, through
deliberate choice or miscalculation, [to a general nuclear war involving
i]{.mark}nter[c]{.mark}ontinental [b]{.mark}allistic
[m]{.mark}issile[s]{.mark}, strategic bombers and apocalyptic
destruction?]{.underline}

the Baltic States?,\"

NATO plans to have around 3,000 troops in the Baltic states by the end
of May as part of the Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) --- the largest
reinforcement of NATO troops in the region for a generation. This
represents a geopolitical shift of focus for NATO, from its earlier
Central European theatre vis-à-vis the Soviet Union, further eastwards
to the Baltic region vis-à-vis Russia. The aim is to demonstrate the
"strength of the transatlantic bond," reiterating to Russia the message
that an attack on one ally would be considered an attack on the whole
NATO alliance, an alliance which now includes the three ex-Soviet
members of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. These NATO troops will be
joining the US troops deployed there as part of Operation Atlantic
Resolve that the Pentagon claimed demonstrates continued "US commitment
to collective security" in Europe.

[Strategic communications planning is part of preparing any military
deployment; however]{.underline}, this [deployment could
face]{.underline} the [Kremlin\'s sophisticated disinformation
operations]{.underline} and propaganda [in NATO territory]{.underline}.
This represents the "geopolitics of disinformation," currently being
tracked by the Centre for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), who argue
that such [Russian "disinformation has]{.underline} specific
geopolitical [objectives]{.underline};" namely to try [to decrease
public support for]{.underline} the [NATO deployments]{.underline} in
both the troop-sending states and the host nation countries.

The [disinformation campaigns]{.underline} waged [by Russia in the
Baltic region]{.underline} may [take different forms. NATO defence
planners]{.underline} and decisionmakers [need to prepare for "fake
news"]{.underline} stories, which report fictional incidents and
opinions. For example, a recent "fake news" story alleged that German
soldiers deployed in Lithuania had raped a teenage girl. A Lithuanian
police investigation determined that the report was false and that the
email from which the story originated was "sent from a country outside
the European Union." Other deceptive reports include: (1) claims that
bad behaviour by allied soldiers deployed in the region has become the
"norm;" (2) reports that allied troops in Latvia would be permitted to
roam the country with loaded weapons; and, (3) allegations that American
soldiers in Latvia have been poisoned with mustard gas that have been
sunk in the Baltic sea, the latter having been published on a Lithuanian
news site after it was hacked. [Specific disinformation was deployed "to
rally]{.underline} the country\'s \[[Latvia]{.underline}\'s\]
Russian-speaking minority [against NATO." Other methods include using
provocations to create incidents]{.underline}, such as the alleged
attempts by a Russian TV crew to pay local youths to riot in Sweden.
Actual incidents may also be used to give them political colour and
portray the allied soldiers as disrespectful of the host Baltic states,
their culture and people, as well as using compromising information
published by the allied soldiers in social media. The risk of allied
troops being provoked in order to discredit the alliance has also been
raised by the head of the Estonian intelligence agency Estonian
Information Board (EIB).

In this regard, [the Baltic states have been heavily targeted by Russia
for their eagerness to have allied forces]{.underline} on the ground and
[accused of "plotting an attack on Russia."]{.underline} The Baltic
states are, however, hardened and sensitised to information attacks,
having learnt many lessons from their history of dealing with Soviet era
Kremlin propaganda. Despite Russian disinformation, the populations of
the Baltic states are very supportive of the allied presence. For
example, a Lithuanian poll, carried out in December 2016, suggested that
81 per cent of respondents supported the permanent presence of NATO
troops in Lithuania. Typical of Russian disinformation strategy was the
rejection of the poll by the website newsbalt.ru (based in the Russian
enclave of Kalingrad), which argued that the poll was skewed "to please"
the Lithuanian Ministry of National Defence.

However, [many of the troop-sending countries are less aware
of]{.underline} the character of the [Kremlin\'s information
warfare]{.underline}. Information warfare is part of the Russian
approach to non-linear warfare that encompasses old and new methods and
tools. One such example is the [Soviet "reflexive control"]{.underline}
that [aims to interfere with]{.underline} the [decisionmaking processes
of the adversary through disinformation and deception]{.underline} and
the use of today\'s information technologies and media, not only in
Russian but many other languages. [It also encompasses "strategic
masking," which is spreading disinformation via media and manipulation
of the adversary]{.underline} into believing reports of military
movements. [With the proliferation of information
technologies]{.underline} and the amounts of private information that
people make available online, national governments, international
organisations and societies have become more vulnerable to information
warfare.

[It is clear that NATO needs to prepare for]{.underline} such
[disinformation campaigns]{.underline}. Some of the EFP framework
[nations have already announced]{.underline} that [they are aware of the
need to deal with these challenges]{.underline}. Most recently Gen.
Jonathan Vance, the Canadian Chief of Defence Staff, announced that
Canada will "take all the precautions" it can and noted that they
"\[...\] have to take on a sophisticated, strategic communications role
so that truth prevails." Gen. Curtis Scaparotti, NATO\'s Supreme Allied
Commander and the Commander of the U.S. European Command, has also
suggested doing more to deal with Russian disinformation, telling the US
Senate Armed Forces Committee that "I think we\'re focused on it, I
don\'t think we\'ve had enough of a response at this point."

While the varied nature of disinformation warfare complicates
preparation, [NATO could pursue well-designed and holistic
strategic]{.underline} communications [approaches in the Baltic states,
while also recognising the threat of disinformation beyond the
region]{.underline}. Countering Russian disinformation requires rapid
investigation of the information and its sources, establishing the facts
and ensuring that the facts reach the same audiences that were targeted
with the disinformation. However, reactive responses alone will likely
be inadequate to deal with the threat. [NATO could be more proactive and
shape the information agenda with support]{.underline} and possibly [led
by the host nations. Soldiers and]{.underline} their
[commanders]{.underline} also [could be educated on the nuances of
preparing for and reacting to information warfare. The Allies might
learn from]{.underline} Lithuania\'s "information influence
identification and analysis ecosystem (PDF)" project that monitors and
analyses physical and electronic information environments. Consulting
with [the NATO Strategic Communications (STRATCOM) Centre of
Excellence]{.underline}, based in Latvia could also help, [given its
work on Russian info]{.underline}rmation [war and propaganda efforts
elsewhere]{.underline} in the region.

In managing disinformation, allies will need therefore to strike the
right balance between combating the disinformation threat and
maintaining secrecy about military details. This balancing act could be
a challenge for NATO and its allies. However, [a proactive and open
communications strategy could]{.underline} help to ensure that
[disinformation does not impact]{.underline} on [military operations in
the Baltic states.]{.underline} Finally, the efforts would likely need
to move beyond a centralised strategic communications messaging plan and
involve each and every soldier, and member of society. This could demand
a higher level of information resilience, especially during the first
months of the deployment.

To conclude, [NATO alliance countries]{.underline} deploying in the
Baltic states [should be prepared to deal with increasing levels of
disinformation]{.underline}, both proactively and reactively. A high
level of preparation, including [an open and robust]{.underline}
communication [strategy, could be crucial in tackling a sophisticated
Russian disinformation campaign aimed to disrupt support for these
deployments]{.underline} in the sending and host nations.

In recent weeks the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) propaganda and
disinformation blitz around COVID-19 has drawn increasing attention, and
with good reason. In addition to promoting a narrative about Beijing's
global leadership around the pandemic, the [Chinese government has
adopted Russian disinformation tactics in promoting conspiracy
theories]{.underline} purporting that COVID-19 originated in Europe, the
United States, and beyond to distract from its failed initial response
to contain the outbreak from spreading beyond Wuhan.

Several accounts of [China's information operations have noted the
incorporation of Russian disinformation tactics]{.underline}. Yet the
full significance of this development cannot be understood without
appreciating the broader alignment between Russia and China. In other
words, [China's adoption of Russian information]{.underline} operation
[techniques is about more than "authoritarian learning,"]{.underline} or
the passive diffusion of such practices from one authoritarian regime to
the next. Instead, [Russia and China are deepening ties and increasing
coordination on a range of economic, defense, technological, and
political issues]{.underline}. These repeated interactions facilitate an
intentional sharing of best practices and are building a foundation for
sustained cooperation moving forward.

Relations between Russia and China developed gradually after the Cold
War and accelerated dramatically in 2014 when Russia's illegal
annexation of Crimea and subsequent occupation of Ukraine shut down
Russian opportunities in and cooperation with Western democracies. These
events drove Russia toward China at a time when the latter was
demonstrating greater foreign policy assertiveness under Xi Jinping. The
CCP leadership was increasingly concerned about perceived Western
efforts to foment "color revolutions" in the wake of the Arab Spring,
the advent of the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong, and Washington's
"pivot to Asia." Since then, there has been an increasing convergence
between Moscow and Beijing's views of how the world should be ordered.
[The two]{.underline} governments [are finding common cause in
undermining liberal democratic norms and institutions, weakening
cohesion among democratic allies and partners, and reducing U.S. global
influence]{.underline}.

Historically, Beijing and Moscow have taken different approaches to
advancing these shared foreign policy objectives. The Kremlin has sought
to sow confusion and exploit divisions to polarize public debates,
whereas China has used subtler tactics conducive to building economic
ties and influence while shaping positive perceptions of China. [China's
disinformation]{.underline} during the pandemic, however, [has evinced a
newfound willingness to deploy the Kremlin's techniques. Beijing has
promoted]{.underline} elaborate [conspiracy theories]{.underline} about
the pandemic's origins [to inject confusion into global
narratives]{.underline}, including one particularly sophisticated scheme
by the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Information Department to pin blame on
the U.S.

China's efforts to burnish its standing as a net provider of public
goods during the pandemic have also benefited from Russia's example.
During a two-week period in March 2020, for example, nearly 50,000
tweets flooded the Twittersphere with pro-China hashtags. Notably,
nearly half of Tweets featuring the hashtag "forzaCinaeItalia" (Go
China, Go Italy) and more than a third of Tweets featuring the hashtag
"grazieCina" (thank you China) stemmed from bots---a quintessentially
Russian tool that Chinese operations have increasingly leveraged---that
averaged more than 50 tweets per day.

[As Russia-China relations continue to deepen, the exchange of best
practices and cross-border learning of disinformation tactics will
become increasingly hardwired into the interactions between them. The
two]{.underline} countries' state media [organizations are increasingly
collaborating with an eye toward formulating common messaging to counter
"Western influence" and promote positive stories about Russian and
Chinese leadership]{.underline} in the world. There is a particular
focus on digital media platforms, where the two countries have pledged
cooperation to combat "illegal online content."

As they work toward shared objectives, [their efforts will produce
dangerous synergies that will pose growing problems for
democracies]{.underline}. Already, Russia and China have an implicit
tactical division of labor. [Russia propagates narratives designed to
undermine trust in institutions, creating fertile ground for Chinese
narratives about the failings of democracy and superiority of
authoritarian systems]{.underline} to take root. Likewise, [as Moscow
and Beijing work toward shared objectives they will be increasingly
singing from the same sheet of music, amplifying a common message about
the flaws and failures of Western democracy and the need for an
alternative]{.underline}, supposedly [values-free vision for
globalization and development. Russian state media have]{.underline}
already [propagated pro-Beijing views on a range of topics]{.underline}
(and vice versa), [forging a symbiotic relationship that supports the
creation of an alternative information ecosystem in which truth is
called into question]{.underline}. Moving forward, Russia and China will
find other common causes where leveraging each other's platforms and
propaganda will broaden their collective reach and impact.

The once bright line between CCP and Kremlin disinformation tactics has
grown fuzzy. During the pandemic, Beijing has demonstrated a willingness
to use disinformation to confuse global audiences and maliciously
discredit democracies to protect the CCP's reputation and promote China
as a responsible global leader by comparison. [Democratic countries must
prepare for a future where i]{.underline}nformation
[o]{.underline}peration[s]{.underline} [are increasingly utilized by
both China and Russia in]{.underline} their varied but [compounding
efforts to undermine liberal norms and democratic institutions,
while]{.underline} also [popularizing]{.underline} aspects of
[authoritarianism. Good governance, aggressive independent media, and
deep understanding of disinformation tactics will be critical to
exposing and countering Chinese and Russian efforts to distort the truth
to advance their interests.]{.underline} Leading [democracies must renew
their global leadership and reinvest in their relationships around the
world]{.underline}. When it comes to [protecting the information
environment, a good offense is truly the best defense]{.underline}.

#### Info warfare makes it [impossible]{.underline} to effectively respond to climate change 

Joseph **Marks 20**, Washington Post reporter, 1/24/20, "The
Cybersecurity 202: Disinformation threat pushes Doomsday Clock closer to
midnight,"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2020/01/24/the-cybersecurity-202-disinformation-threat-pushes-doomsday-clock-closer-to-midnight/5e29d32d88e0fa6ea99d3426/

[[Online disinformation]{.mark} campaigns are not just a threat to the
2020 election. They [may be a harbinger of the end of the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Metaphorically speaking, at least.

Concerns over \"cyber-enabled information warfare\" were one reason the
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists pushed the Doomsday Clock up to 100
seconds to midnight, a metaphor for the global apocalypse. That's first
time the clock has passed the two-minute mark since it was first used to
gauge civilization\'s existential threats soon after the dawn of the
nuclear age in 1947.

[[Disinformation]{.mark} driven by]{.underline} swarms of computer [bots
and emerging technology [such as deepfakes are sowing rancor]{.mark}
across the world [and making it far harder to deal with existential
threats such as nuclear war and climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
Bulletin's Science and Security Board writes.

"The [[international security]{.underline}]{.mark} situation [[is now
more dangerous than]{.mark} it has [ever]{.mark} been, even at the
height of the Cold War]{.underline}," the authors write. "\... The Clock
continues to tick. Immediate action is required."

The authors, who include scientists, public policy experts and former
politicians, are less concerned about specific [[disinfo]{.mark}rmation
[campaigns, such as]{.mark} those [Russia]{.mark} mounted]{.underline}
to damage Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016 or those that U.S.
intelligence and law enforcement agencies say Russia, China, Iran and
others are likely to use in 2020. Rather, they fear the result of those
campaigns [[will broadly undermine]{.mark} public [faith in]{.mark}
facts and [expertise to the point]{.mark} that [it's impossible to
tackle climate change]{.mark} and other pressing global
problems]{.underline}.

"If these current trends continue, [we're looking at a world in which
the information environment is so corrupt that rational and
reality-based discourse is impossible]{.underline}," Herb Lin, a member
of the science and security board and a senior research scholar for
cyber policy at Stanford University, told me.

The Bulletin first cited the threat of information warfare in a 2018
update when board members moved the clock to two minutes to midnight.
For comparison, that\'s the same setting as in 1953 after the United
States and Soviet Union first tested thermonuclear weapons, which are
about 1,000 times as destructive as the atomic bombs the United States
dropped on Japan during World War II. This year, the board moved the
clock another 20 seconds closer.

Cybersecurity and information warfare experts I spoke with largely
backed up the Bulletin's assessment yesterday.

"[[Cyber-enabled info]{.mark}rmation [warfare]{.mark} and the consequent
rise of a 'there is no truth' culture [undercuts]{.mark} our [societies'
ability to take]{.mark} ... difficult, [large scale and]{.mark} timely
[actions]{.mark}]{.underline}," Chris Painter, the State Department's
former top cybersecurity diplomat who served during the Obama
administration and early months of the Trump administration, told me.

Melanie Teplinsky, a former White House and National Security Agency
official who's now an adjunct professor at American University's
Washington College of Law, warned that "[cyber-enabled information
warfare poses an outsized threat because of its ability to undermine the
reliability of the information on which we rely for rational
decision-making in nearly every domain]{.underline}."

#### Warming causes extinction

An [[existential risk]{.mark} to civilisation is]{.underline} one
[posing permanent large negative consequences]{.underline} to humanity
[which [may]{.mark} never [be]{.mark} undone]{.underline}, either
[[annihilating intelligent life]{.underline}]{.mark} [or permanently and
drastically curtailing its potential]{.underline}.

[With]{.underline} the [[commitments]{.mark} by nations [to]{.mark} the
2015 [Paris]{.mark} Agreement, the current path of warming is 3°C or
more]{.underline} by 2100. [But this figure [do]{.mark}es [not include
"long-term"]{.mark}]{.underline} [[carbon-cycle feedbacks, which
are]{.mark} materially relevant now and in the near future due to
the]{.underline} [[unprecedented]{.mark} rate]{.underline} [at which
human activity is perturbing the climate system]{.underline}. Taking
these into account, the Paris path would lead to around 5°C of warming
by 2100.

Scientists warn that [warming of [4°]{.mark}C is incompatible with an
organised global community, [is]{.mark}]{.underline} [[devastating
to]{.mark} the majority of [ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and has a
[high probability]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} not [being]{.mark}
stable]{.underline}. The World Bank says it may be "[[beyond
adaptation]{.underline}]{.mark}". But [an existential threat may also
exist for many peoples and regions at a significantly lower level of
warming]{.underline}. In 2017, [3°C of warming was categorised as
"catastrophic"]{.underline} with a warning that, on a path of unchecked
emissions, low-probability, [high-[impact]{.mark} warming [could be
catastrophic by 2050]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The Emeritus Director of the Potsdam Institute, Prof. Hans Joachim
Schellnhuber, warns that "[climate change is now reaching
the]{.underline} [end-game]{.underline}, [where very soon [humanity must
choose between]{.mark} taking [unprecedented action, or]{.mark}
[accepting]{.mark} that it has been left too late and bear [the
consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}." He says that [if we continue down
[the present path]{.mark} "there is a very big risk that we
[will]{.mark} just]{.underline} [[end]{.mark} our
[civilisation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The human species will survive
somehow but we will destroy almost everything we have built up over the
last two thousand years."11

Unfortunately, conventional risk and probability analysis becomes
useless in these circumstances because it excludes the full implications
of outlier events and possibilities lurking at the fringes.12

[Prudent risk-management means a tough, objective look at the real risks
to which we are exposed, especially at those ["fat-tail" events]{.mark},
which may have consequences that are damaging beyond quantification, and
[threaten]{.mark} the [survival]{.mark} of human
civilisation.]{.underline}

[Global warming projections display a "fat-tailed" distribution [with
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [[greater likelihood]{.underline} [of
warming]{.underline}]{.mark} [that is well [in]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[excess of]{.mark} the [average amount]{.mark} of warming [predicted
by]{.mark} climate [models]{.mark}, and are of a higher probability than
would be expected]{.underline} under typical statistical assumptions.
More importantly, the risk lies disproportionately in the "fat-tail"
outcomes, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Fearing the end of the enlightenment

The [Enlightenment established reason and reality as]{.underline} the
[foundational pillars of]{.underline} civilized [discourse.]{.underline}
In [such discourse]{.underline}, [logic matters]{.underline}, and a
logical contradiction between state- ment A and statement B means that
at least one of those statements is false. The [truth]{.underline} of a
statement [about the world is]{.underline} [tested by]{.underline} its
[correspondence to]{.underline} objective [reality rather than by how
many people believe it]{.underline}; that is, [empiri- c]{.underline}al
data are [influential.]{.underline} Furthermore, [statements known to be
wrong or false do not affect conclusions]{.underline} or choices
[between alternative courses of action.]{.underline}

[Cyber-enabled info]{.underline}rmation [war]{.underline}fare [provides
the tactics, tools, and procedures]{.underline} -- in short, the means
-- [to replace the pillars of logic, truth, and reality with fantasy,
rage, and fear. In]{.underline} a [world of ubiquitous cyber-enabled
info]{.underline}rmation [war-]{.underline} fare, [communication and
info]{.underline}rmation [inflame passions rather than informing
reason]{.underline}, [play to the worst]{.underline} in [people's
cognitive]{.underline} [architectures rather than the best]{.underline},
[and divide rather than unify]{.underline}. [Deliberate corruption
of]{.underline} the [information ecosystem]{.underline} could be seen as
an [analog of poisoning water supplies that can be done remotely,
inexpensively, and anonymously]{.underline}. All of this is just another
way of saying that [today it is possible to see glimmerings of an anti-
Enlightenment that can possibly take root and that would indeed be the
end of civilization]{.underline} as we know it.

[Adversaries foreign and domestic that]{.underline} make [use
cyber-enabled info]{.underline}rmation [warfare turn our internal
cognitive processes and our external institutional and legal processes
against us.]{.underline} Under the cover of "fair play" rubrics and the
First Amendment, [they have turned us against ourselves.]{.underline}
[Desperately needed are ways of countering the insidious tactics of
cyber-enabled information warfare for ourselves]{.underline}.

How might we proceed? [We need]{.underline} action [to
develop]{.underline} better [ways of identifying adversary]{.underline}
cyber-enabled infor- mation warfare [campaigns in progress]{.underline};
[good counter- measures to help human beings resist]{.underline} the use
of cyber- enabled information warfare
[op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline} [targeted against
them]{.underline}; [and good measures to degrade, disrupt, or expose the
adversary's use of cyber-enabled information warfare
operations]{.underline}. All of this is easier said than done, however,
as [cyber-enabled capabilities for info]{.underline}rmation [warfare
increase while human]{.underline} cognitive [limitations remain the
same]{.underline}. [Our work is cut out for us. If we fail]{.underline},
[the world is at increasing risk of large-scale and long-term societal
frac- ture, the end of the Enlightenment, and the start of an
informational Dark Age.]{.underline}

Beyond these US, UK, and Finnish examples, [comprehensive approaches to
political warfare among NATO members and partners are less
prominent.]{.underline} Perhaps in part owing to bureaucratic
stovepiping and policymaking preferences, many capitals of [NATO member
states that are targets of these campaigns]{.underline} tend to view
each of Moscow and Beijing's actions discretely rather than as
constituent parts of a holistic strategy. Failure to consider these
activities and their implications holistically---and, therefore,
[failing to address their respective behaviors in a likewise holistic
manner--- risks the United States and its allies taking actions that
achieve short-term successes at the expense of longer-term
gains.]{.underline} Progress on areas like the EU-China Comprehensive
Agreement on Investment (CAI), for example, which seeks to replace
bilateral trade agreements between EU members and China with a common
EU-wide investment framework, can present longer-term strategic risks to
European states, including increased vulnerability to Chinese economic
coercion and influence campaigns---not to mention heightened tensions in
the transatlantic relationship due to increasingly divergent strategic
approaches to China.47 [In other words, a strategic-level approach
between NATO, its member states and partners]{.underline}, the private
sector, and like-minded multilateral organizations like the EU [is
needed, as is a framework to turn strategic consensus into concrete
action.]{.underline} Fortunately, both by treaty and by recent
operational practice, NATO is well positioned to serve as a bedrock for
both. [The Alliance can, therefore, usefully serve as a catalyst for
developing a Comprehensive Approach to combat coercion and political

Countering Political Warfare

NATO stepping up to take on a larger role in countering political
warfare has its trade-offs, and some might reasonably express concern
about the knock-on effect that such an approach might have on the
conduct of military affairs. Some concerns may include: first, if NATO
is predominantly a military alliance, then it doesn't have a significant
role to play in countering political warfare, which is the realm of
politicians, statesmen, home departments, departments of commerce, and
so on. Second, to assign political warfare as a supporting task to
militaries, and military institutions like NATO, would likely dilute
their focus on their essential defense functions (which are hard enough
to perform on the best of days). It might also lessen the pressure on
NATO allies and partners to effectively share the costs of hard defense.
In the minds of critics, adding political warfare to the growing list of
NATO's tasks means diminishing Alliance effectiveness.

[These arguments---however well-intentioned---are unhelpfully divorced
from both NATO's history and current realities]{.underline}. NATO is,
and [always has been, a political-military alliance]{.underline} in
large part because contemporary alliances are themselves an inherently
political-military construct.48 To argue for the disaggregation of the
military from the economic and political spheres is a conceit, arguably
framed by present bureaucratic realities rather than institutional
history. The post-World War II order, of which NATO is a part, was
designed to be a proactive, forward-looking answer to the security
dilemmas and distrust that had previously characterized alliance
politics.49 "Despair, disorder, decay from within---these were the
likely dangers, not a Soviet invasion."50 As the USSR's aggressive
intentions became more clear[, NATO itself became a solution to enabling
European integration and economic revitalization rather than an end in
and of itself.51]{.underline}

As NATO was established, reconstituting the economic and political
health of its member states was seen as inextricably linked to military
strength; military strength was one important pillar of a comprehensive
strategy to counter Soviet influence and aggression. 52 NATO's purpose,
therefore, as established in the Washington Treaty, is not only to
grapple with military and defense challenges, but also to foster and
protect the values core to its mission and that distinguish NATO as an
alliance of like-minded nations. This is why NATO not only convenes
military leaders and defense ministers at regular defense ministerial
meetings,53 but it also hosts foreign ministers at the same regularity54
and heads of state and government roughly once a year at summits or
Leaders Meetings.55 Protecting the rights of its members as free and
self-determining nations means, in essence, NATO allies have committed
to upholding the integrity of the very institutions that are vulnerable
to political warfare. This is why Article 2 of the Washington Treaty
exists. It reads:

"The Parties will contribute toward the further development of peaceful
and friendly international relations by strengthening their free
institutions, by bringing about a better understanding of the principles
upon which these institutions are founded, and by promoting conditions
of stability and well-being. They will seek to eliminate conflict in
their international economic policies and will encourage economic
collaboration between any or all of them."56

Article 2 of NATO's founding charter is sometimes viewed as the
"Canadian clause" or a throwaway paragraph in the Washington Treaty.57
Yet negotiators of NATO agreements know that they should never discount
a good diplomatic "hook," especially when it might be used to prompt
positive action. Viewed in that light, Article 2 holds enormous utility
in supporting and justifying much-needed NATO action on the political
warfare challenges allies face on a routine basis. NATO has forgotten
how to exercise its political arm to proactively contend with political
and economic coercion as effectively as it does its military arm.
Article 2 is critical to establishing an effective counter-political
warfare response from NATO.

Specifically, in Article 2, allies have pledged to:

■ Shore up free institutions;

■ Establish public understanding of the principles undergirding
institutions;

■ Promote stability and well-being; and

■ Eliminate conflict from international economic policies

and promote economic collaboration.

These Article 2 principles are the very areas at risk from Russian and
Chinese political warfare today. NATO allies and partners have fallen
behind in combatting the political and economic components of political
warfare across the spectrum; as a result, NATO should rethink the
mandate it already has and reinvigorate Article 2 to help empower and
enable a more effective, comprehensive response to future political
warfare campaigns.

This leads to the second concern articulated above, namely, that
expanding the aperture of NATO's activities will inherently dilute the
Alliance and its military capabilities. This logic perhaps makes sense
in the narrower context of burden sharing and defense planning. Yet the
military is not an end in and of itself; rather, the object of the
military is to be one means toward the promotion of national security
and prosperity. Promotion of stability and security---and, therefore,
(if indirectly) prosperity---has been interpreted in a variety of
manners over the course of NATO's history: from deterring Soviet
aggression to responding to crises in the Balkans and the Middle East to
overcoming Franco-German and Greco-Turkish differences. Further,
identifying and countering political warfare is largely an intellectual
endeavor; organized appropriately, the cost of building a NATO
counter-political warfare capability would be miniscule in comparison to
the cost of purchasing defense equipment and acquiring capabilities.
Given that today the stability, security, and prosperity of NATO allies
and partners are being directly challenged by both Russia and China,
this marginal investment would likely yield enormous strategic
dividends.

Economic and political coercion campaigns have important linkages to
national security---linkages that are often difficult for agencies and
institutions to fully appreciate on their own. Trade ministries have a
different set of priorities than defense ministries, but they both work
on matters that have a direct bearing on the security and well-being of
their states. A greater cross-pollination of government efforts improves
assessments of the threat and development of potential solutions.

Taking Stock: Assessing Existing Alliance and Partner Efforts to Counter
Political Warfare

[NATO might usefully seek to build shared understandings of, and
approaches to, countering authoritarian coercion in two key areas:
disinformation and election interference]{.underline}, and coercive
diplomacy and economic subversion.58 What follows is an assessment of
the current state of play and areas ripe for multi-stakeholder
collaboration on these key issues. [Current efforts underway by the
Alliance and its members tend to focus on discrete areas of political
warfare rather than the full gambit. Countering disinformation and cyber
defense are the two most advanced areas of the transatlantic response to
hybrid warfare, yet NATO allies and partners lack advanced strategies to
mitigate coercive diplomacy and predatory economic
practices.]{.underline}

[Disinformation and Election Interference]{.underline}

Alliance-Wide Efforts

[Disinformation is one of the most nefarious challenges NATO faces.
False news and the spread of "alternative" facts and narratives creates
confusion, foments distrust in democratic institutions and government
itself, sharpens societal divisions, and creates negative psychological
and emotional responses that can be used to manipulate people's
viewpoints and beliefs.]{.underline} Across Europe, nations come under
near-daily attack from state-supported and rogue actor disinformation,
from Russian-language campaigns, Chinese propaganda, social media
swarms, and online bots. As Russia and China seek to shape the
information environment in their favor,59 NATO allies have put various
initiatives in place to help combat disinformation and build societal
resilience. Allies have pursued different national initiatives and the
Alliance has worked to share best practices. It is worth noting that
NATO is further advanced in its understanding and response to Russian
disinformation than it is of Chinese disinformation which is much less
analyzed and understood in a transatlantic context.

#### Truth decay undermines effective responses to [every]{.underline} existential risk 

Michael **Rich 20**. President and Chief Executive Officer of the RAND
Corporation. 10-22-2020. \"Think Tanks in the Era of Truth Decay,\"
<https://www.rand.org/blog/rand-review/2020/10/think-tanks-in-the-era-of-truth-decay.html>

We are living through a moment of crisis that will define who we are as
a nation; yet [we can\'t even agree on what\'s real and what\'s
rumor.]{.underline} Our political discourse too often amounts to
opinions about opinions, shouted across a cable-television split screen.
Asked to describe their feelings toward the federal government, a
majority of Americans say either "frustrated" or "angry."

[All of this points to a civic disease that I\'ve been calling "[Truth
Decay]{.mark}," and that [has enfeebled our response to]{.mark}
everything from [climate change]{.mark} to domestic [terrorism]{.mark}
to a global [pandemic]{.mark}.]{.underline} [It\'s the diminishing role
of facts and analysis in American public life]{.underline}, and it cuts
much deeper than any political party or demographic. It\'s why
nonpartisan think tanks like RAND are as important now as they have ever
been.

I\'ve always said that RAND is an idea as much as a research
institute---a belief that [the best way to solve the most complex and
difficult problems is to begin with [facts]{.mark} and objective
analysis.]{.underline} In our early days, [that meant figuring
out]{.underline} how to put a satellite into orbit, or [how to [manage
the threat of]{.mark} global [nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today,
[[it means]{.mark} saving lives and livelihoods from COVID-19, building
a more just and equitable society, and [responding to]{.mark} the
ever-changing [threats]{.mark} of an ever-accelerating
world.]{.underline} Our goal throughout has been to make communities
safer and more secure, healthier and more prosperous.

At RAND, we have never shied away from a problem because it is too
difficult or too complex. We\'ve made countering Truth Decay one of our
highest priorities because it is both, and because it threatens the very
foundations of our democracy.

In recent and soon-to-be-published studies, [[there\'s]{.mark} a
[growing]{.mark} body of [evidence]{.mark} showing [that people]{.mark}
don\'t just [lack trust in]{.mark} American [institutions]{.mark} like
Congress or the media. They actively distrust them.]{.underline} They
expect those institutions to display some basic competence, to provide
accurate information, to perform their duties with integrity. And they
just don\'t see it.

And so, often, they just walk away from the public square. Last year, we
asked hundreds of Americans where they get their news. More than a
quarter of them said they know where they could go for reliable facts
and information---sources like newspapers or television news shows. They
just don\'t have the time or interest to bother.

We\'ve made countering Truth Decay one of our highest priorities because
it threatens the very foundations of our democracy.

[That kind of disengagement has helped drive a wedge between what is
true and what we think is true.]{.underline} Crime rates in American
cities are far below the peaks we saw in the 1990s, but you would hardly
be alone if you thought it has never been more dangerous to walk down
the street. The scientific evidence for childhood vaccines has never
been so strong, yet the World Health Organization recently listed
vaccine hesitancy as one of the greatest threats to global health.

That\'s what I mean when I talk about Truth Decay. The proliferation of
cable news shows and social media sites has resulted in an echo chamber
of voices that agree with us---or a shouting gallery of those that
don\'t. The switch from one-hour network news programs to 24-hour
coverage did not come with a 24-fold increase in reported facts. We
shouldn\'t be surprised when people use words like "frustrated" or
"angry" to describe the national mood.

But here\'s why I\'m optimistic.

A few years ago, RAND endeavored to review all of the evidence for and
against some of the most common ideas for reducing gun
violence---tougher background checks, for example, or weapon bans. We
found that there was often a lack of reliable evidence either way.
Federal constraints on gun research had created a factual vacuum around
one of our most vociferous debates. Everyone was just shouting into the
void.

That study, though, caught the attention of the Laura and John Arnold
Foundation, now called Arnold Ventures. It brought together a research
consortium to invest up to \$50 million in gun violence research. And
Congress, which had resisted funding research into gun violence for 20
years, passed a bipartisan spending bill to provide \$25 million more.

We\'ve seen periods before in American history when the truth struggled
to be heard. Some of those eras ended with new forms of journalism,
recommitted to chasing down facts and holding those in power to account.
Others ended with government reforms aimed at earning back the trust of
the governed. None of them ended without renewed faith in objective
analysis to guide public policy.

As a research institute with two core values---quality and
objectivity---that\'s our stock in trade. The problems we face, as a
nation and a world, demand a workforce of people who can collect and
analyze data, think through solutions, and provide insights and
recommendations without spin or bias. The standards we set at
RAND---research that is transparent and clear, based on the best
information, and temperate in tone---are meant to ensure that the bluest
of blue-state Democrats and the reddest of red-state Republicans can
trust our findings equally.

When we launched a fundraising campaign for the future of RAND earlier
this year, we named it "Tomorrow Demands Today." That\'s a different way
of saying what French writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry once wrote, a line
I\'ve always thought spoke directly to RAND: "[Your job is not [to
foresee the future]{.mark}, but to enable it."]{.underline} [At this
moment in history, that [means restoring facts]{.mark} a]{.underline}nd
analysis to the core of American public policy.

[[The stakes could not be higher]{.underline}]{.mark}. As a longtime
friend, a former chairman of the board at RAND, told me, RAND was
established more than 70 years ago to address the existential threat of
the time, the Soviet Union and its nuclear arsenal. [[Truth
Decay]{.underline}]{.mark}, he said, [[is the existential threat of our
time.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[That]{.underline}, unfortunately[, is the truth]{.underline}.

On [the existential threat from cyber-enabled information
warfare]{.underline}

[Corruption of the information ecosystem has become an existential
threat to civilization]{.underline} as we know it because [prosperity
and advancement depend on a secure information
infrastructure]{.underline} and environment [that provides]{.underline}
human beings with contextualized, reliable, [trustworthy
information]{.underline} when and where it is needed. [Information is as
much a part of human ecology]{.underline} and the essence of being human
[as DNA]{.underline} (itself a form of information!) is a part of the
evolutionary processes [in biological systems]{.underline}.

Today, [chaos reigns in]{.underline} much of [the information ecosystem
on which societies depend]{.underline}. In many forums for political and
societal discourse, [national leaders shout about fake
news]{.underline}, by which they mean information they do not like.
These same leaders lie shamelessly, calling their lies truth, or perhaps
"truthful hyperbole." Acting across national boundaries, these [leaders
and their surrogates exacerbate existing divisions, creating rage and
diminishing confidence in elections and democratic
institutions]{.underline}. Using unsupported anecdotes and sketchy
rhetoric, denialists undermine well-established science about climate
change and other urgent issues. [Established institutions of the
government]{.underline}, journalism, [and education]{.underline} --
institutions [that have traditionally provided stability]{.underline} --
[are under attack]{.underline} precisely because they have provided
stability.

The founding of the Bulletin predates by several decades the widespread
availability of computers, the Internet, smart phones, search engines,
and social media. Few could imagine in 1945 a technological environment
that affords today's high-speed and widespread connectivity, high
degrees of anonymity, insensitivity to distance and national borders,
easy and customized information searches, democratized access to
publishing capabilities, inexpensive production and consumption of
information content (including and increasingly importantly emotionally
evocative video and audio content), disintermediation of established
information sources, and ubiquitous, always-on, always-available access
to information sources through mobile devices.

Such [advances in info]{.underline}rmation [technology]{.underline} have
[heralded the arrival of the information age]{.underline}, a world in
which taking near-immediate advantage of information opens up enormous
opportunities in both the private and public sectors for improved
delivery of existing products and services and, perhaps more important,
the creation of entirely new products and services. Products and
services can be customized to individual needs and preferences on a
large scale and at more affordable costs. Transactional friction can be
tremendously reduced. Through the Internet of Things, actuators and
sensors can be connected to process control computers to optimize the
behavior and function of physical systems. [Everywhere]{.underline} that
[information can be used to create and improve new and existing
functionality]{.underline} (that is, essentially everywhere), [one can
find or imagine new information technologies to do so]{.underline}.

At the same time, [advances in information technology have a dark side.
The]{.underline} same [increases in the volume and velocity of
information have created a]{.underline} louder and [more chaotic
information environment that stimulates fast, angry, reflexive,
intuitive, and visceral thinking]{.underline}, reaction, [and action in
people and]{.underline} thus [displaces more complex, reflective, and
rational thought. In a chaotic environment of information]{.underline}
overload, [people are more likely to use mental shortcuts]{.underline}
as a way [to reduce the cognitive burden that]{.underline} such [an
environment places on their thinking]{.underline}.

Nuclear conflict

[On the risks of nuclear conflict]{.underline}, [theories and approaches
to nuclear deterrence]{.underline} and strategic stability developed
prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union in the late 1980's and early
1990's [rest on the presumption of rationality in national decision
makers]{.underline}. In particular, they assume that adversaries are
deterred from attacking by a threat of retaliation that would impose
costs on the adversary that would outweigh any conceivable benefits that
it would gain from an attack (Morgan 2003). [Central to this assumption
is a rational adversary that can and does make a calculation of expected
costs and benefits, com- pares them, and then acts
accordingly.]{.underline}

But the psychologically informed understanding of real- world decision
making described above was not accepted widely in the scientific
literature until approximately the same time as the collapse of the
Soviet Union, and the seminal work in such understanding occurred only
in the decade previous to that. What [a psychologically-informed
understanding of real-world decision making tells us]{.underline} is
[that]{.underline} the [rationality assumption at the base of much
traditional thinking on deterrence and strategic stability is
untenable]{.underline}, [given that humans have evolved to rely on
intuitive, reflex- ive, heuristic System 1 thinking to make
decisions]{.underline}, [particu- larly when faced with time pressures,
surprise and other obstacles to the deliberate calculation]{.underline}
implied by System 2 thinking (Kahneman 2011). [Psychology tells us
that]{.underline} -- more often than not -- [the fast, intuitive
judgements of System 1 often take precedence over the slower, more
analytical thinking of System 2.]{.underline}

The [challenges posed by reflexive reliance on System 1
thinking]{.underline} are [greatly accentuated by]{.underline}
characteristics of today's [information environment.]{.underline}
[Social media networks in particular are optimally designed to stimulate
System 1 thinking]{.underline} -- emotional, reflexive, immediate --
[and]{.underline} they [rapidly transmit content among like-minded
individuals]{.underline}, [creating the ideal conditions for public
polarization and divisiveness to occur (]{.underline}Pfeffer, Zorbach,
and Carley 2014). Multiple [narratives rapidly emerge around complex
events]{.underline}; [citizens splinter into their own informational
universes and are unable to agree on an underlying reality]{.underline}.
[Political leaders themselves are subject to these conflicting
narratives and may even be active and influ- ential participants in one
or another of them]{.underline}.

It is thus [easy to posit that in this info]{.underline}rmation [envir-
onment, manipulated information]{.underline} -- either [artificially
constructed]{.underline} or adopted by a strong grassroots base --
[could be used by interested parties to generate pres- sure on leaders
to act.]{.underline} At the same time, [leaders them- selves are likely
to be facing information overload and less able to distinguish analyzed
information from their own intelligence sources and other, unvetted
informa- tion originating from their constituencies.]{.underline}

Russia could launch a conventional military invasion of Ukraine at any
moment, but it could also destabilize and undermine it without ever
firing a shot. Russian military exercises and positioning are powerful
tools of unpredictability that keep NATO and Ukraine off balance while
[Russian operatives]{.underline} and their proxies [wage a hybrid war
through]{.underline} covert operations, [coordinated disinformation
campaigns, and cyber attacks. To build resilience]{.underline} against
hybrid warfare, [NATO should collaborate with the private sector and
devote more resources to]{.underline} technology [literacy and
innovation.]{.underline}

Russia's Hybrid Warfare Strategy

Russia's strategy is centered on promoting a narrative of grievances.
Russia believes the United States is using Ukraine and promoting NATO
expansion to contain Russian national security interests and encroach on
its traditional spheres of influence. It also contends that Ukraine
should return to the Minsk Agreements and end its attempt to win back
Donbas. These are false narratives because sovereign and independent
states have the freedom to determine their own path and seek membership
in any alliance. And it would be madness for the Ukrainian government to
retake Donbas given the Russian military presence there. The [Russian
rhetoric is a trojan horse created by the Kremlin to]{.underline}
renegotiate the end of the Cold War and [redraw European
borders]{.underline} the same way Russia did when it illegally annexed
Crimea in 2014.

The [effectiveness of]{.underline} the [Russian narrative depends on
combining]{.underline} conventional [military]{.underline} positioning
[with hybrid tactics]{.underline} or "active measures." Hybrid actions
taken in the so-called "gray-zone" typically consist of measures short
of conventional warfare such as limited strikes, special operations
forces, raids, cyber attacks, and covert influence operations. [Hybrid
warfare is]{.underline} a [central]{.underline} element [of Russia's
military]{.underline} strategy, in which operatives remain just below
the radar and work with proxies to stage false flags to justify an
invasion. To crush the Prague Spring in 1968, Soviet operatives in
Czechoslovakia planted weapons in packages labeled "Made in the USA,"
which were published in Soviet state-controlled outlets as signs of a
U.S.-led plot. The KGB ran active measures during the Soviet war in
Afghanistan in the 1980's, often using "false bands" of Afghan units
posing as CIA-backed guerillas to justify Soviet military operations.

Misinformation and [disinformation are quickly and efficiently
distributed through news]{.underline} channels [and social
media]{.underline} to influence public opinion. Russian [state-owned
outlets]{.underline} Russia Today (RT), Tass, and Sputnik [have a strong
presence]{.underline} on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Telegram,
echoing the Kremlin's position and [portraying NATO]{.underline} and the
United States [as aggressors]{.underline}. In 2013-2014, [Russian
state]{.underline} media [framed the Maidan protests]{.underline} that
toppled Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych [as "fomented by the
U.S.]{.underline} in cooperation with fascist Ukrainian nationalists"
that were used as a pretext for Russia's little green men to seize
Crimea.

One Russian-backed channel on YouTube is НАШ or NASH TV, which has been
promoting Russia's narrative until it was banned in Ukraine. Founded by
former pro-Russia Ukraine parliament member Yevheniy Murayev, NASH TV is
a Kremlin mouth piece flooding viewers with anti-American and anti-NATO
falsehoods. Last month, the United Kingdom accused Russia of attempting
to overthrow Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and replace him with
Murayev. This is the same approach used by Russia when it seized Crimea
and installed Sergey Aksyonov as the so-called Prime Minister of Crimea.

[Sustained Russian information operations reinforce]{.underline}
specific elements in [Moscow's narrative of grievances]{.underline}.
First, [NATO's]{.underline} eastward [expansion]{.underline} since the
end of the Cold War [is the real threat, not Russia]{.underline}.
Second, [Ukraine and Georgia joining NATO would threaten]{.underline}
the European [security order]{.underline}. Third, the [annexation of
Crimea and support for separatists in Donbas are
liberations]{.underline} of Russian-speaking communities.

[Troll factories and bots spread large volumes of fake news]{.underline}
stories, making it almost impossible to counter the steady deluge of
disinformation. On January 31, it Western media reported that Russia
planted fake stories about bomb threats against Ukrainian schools and
shopping malls, forcing children to online learning and closing
businesses. Just last week, U.S. [officials uncovered a
plot]{.underline} by Russian intelligence [to fabricate a propaganda
video portraying fake explosions]{.underline}, corpses, [and grieving
women]{.underline} designed [to legitimate a Russian
invasion]{.underline} to protect civilians [in Ukraine]{.underline}.

Russia supplements information operations with cyber attacks. Russian
hackers recently breached Ukrainian networks, replacing publicly facing
websites with messages in Ukrainian and Polish designed to look like a
Polish cyber operation. Russian cyber attacks targeted Georgian networks
during the 2008 South Ossetia War and again in 2015 when Sandworm, a
hacking group linked with Russian intelligence, took down Ukraine's
power grid.

[Russian]{.underline} state-sponsored [cyber attacks]{.underline}
targeting Ukraine [can devastate U.S. and NATO networks]{.underline}.
The 2017 Notpetya and WannaCry attacks spread throughout the world soon
after hitting their targets. In the 2020 Solar Winds hack, cyber
criminals directed by Russian intelligence inserted malicious code into
updates in Orion software that infected servers used by the U.S.
Treasury, Energy, and Defense Departments, as well as Microsoft, Intel,
and Cisco. The [U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency]{.underline} recently [warned U.S. networks are vulnerable to
more Russian cyber attacks.]{.underline}

[Russia]{.underline} also [uses blended cyber operations]{.underline},
in which governments tolerate cyber criminals and ransomware groups
operating in their countries. For example, the 2021 cyber attacks
against Colonial Pipeline, which controls much of the fuel along the
U.S. East Coast, were launched by criminal group Darkside operating in
Russia. Darkside locked up Colonial Pipeline's networks and held data
hostage until it paid a ransom of \$5 million.

Steps NATO Should Take

Information warfare and cyber attacks demonstrate that [NATO must get
serious about building resilience against hybrid]{.underline} war
[tactics]{.underline}. This means [prioritizing counter-hybrid
measures]{.underline} in NATO's next Strategic Concept, which will be
developed in June. [NATO should]{.underline} take the following steps to
[counter Russian information operations]{.underline}:

1.  NATO's next Strategic Concept should update Article V of the North
    Atlantic Charter, which commits NATO members to defend one another,
    to include hybrid war tactics in addition to conventional military
    actions. While the range of gray-zone operations makes it difficult
    to know when and how to trigger the collective defense mechanism,
    [NATO members should engage in deterrence in the contemporary
    battlespace.]{.underline}

2.  [NATO must establish a network of innovation centers to expand
    on]{.underline} its [existing centers]{.underline} of excellence.
    [NATO developed]{.underline} the Strategic Communications
    [Centre]{.underline} of Excellence [in Latvia to identify
    disinformation and]{.underline} the Cooperative Cyber Center of
    Excellence [in Estonia]{.underline} to monitor cyber operations.
    NATO also approved the NATO-Industry Cyber Partnership to improve
    the alliance's relationship with private firms and coordinate cyber
    defense efforts.

3.  [New NATO innovation centers could engage in cutting-edge research
    and development on artificial intelligence]{.underline}, quantum
    computing, autonomous machines, hypersonic technologies, [and
    information and technology literacy]{.underline}. Innovation centers
    could be modeled on the European Union's East Stratcom Task Force,
    which is staffed with experts specializing in Russian propaganda
    through its EUDisinfo site. Innovation centers funded through NATO's
    Science for Peace and Security program could partner with NATO's
    Joint Intelligence and Security Division (JISD).These [centers
    could]{.underline} also [develop public-private partnerships
    with]{.underline} commercial [firms, academic institutions, and
    civil society groups to build resilience through training
    centers]{.underline}, research institutes, and information
    technology programming.

4.  Governance and rule of law among alliance members must be improved
    as weak institutions provide maligned external actors avenues to
    interfere. For example, while [an innovation center]{.underline} can
    improve North Macedonia's ability to combat disinformation and
    cyberattacks, it [must]{.underline} also [improve domestic
    governance]{.underline}, combat corruption, strengthen judicial
    practices, and enhance economic opportunities. President Biden's
    executive actions targeting corruption in the Western Balkans is a
    significant step to promote accountability.

The [most effective way to defend against]{.underline} Russian [hybrid
tactics is]{.underline} for NATO [to partner with the private
sector]{.underline} and academia [to lead research and development
initiatives that can boost alliance-wide]{.underline} emerging and
disruptive [technologies policies]{.underline}. Since [many
security-related applications]{.underline} of emerging and disruptive
technologies [are derived from private firms, partnering with
companies]{.underline}, start-ups, and universities and research
institutes [is essential to securing alliance members]{.underline} in
the 21st Century. [NATO should invest in strengthening capacity and
innovation against hybrid attacks]{.underline} as much as it invests in

Even the pandemic has the potential for fomenting political unrest. 

In recent days, thousands of Serbs have taken to the streets to protest
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic's announced strict curfew in response
to a surge in Covid-19 cases. Many have pointed a finger
at pro-Russia ultra-right groups and foreign intelligence services for
fueling the violent riots.

Moscow denies any "Russian trace" in the unrest. Whether Russia is
behind the violent protests in Belgrade remains to be seen. One thing is
for certain. The Kremlin's efforts to sow mayhem in the Balkans would
not be new; this would merely be the latest attempt by a resurgent
Russia to threaten Euro-Atlantic security and challenge the United
States' ability to defend its interests in Europe. 

[Russia is promoting]{.underline} its [interests in the]{.underline}
Western [Balkans through the widespread use of
disinformation]{.underline} and cyberwarfare. [The U.S.]{.underline},
however, [isn't helpless. It has an opportunity to]{.underline} obtain
insights into these efforts and [counter Russia\'s
influence]{.underline} campaigns. [It is time to confront]{.underline}
Russia\'s strongman Vladimir [Putin\'s cyber games]{.underline} before
American interests are permanently damaged in the Balkans. 

The U.S. and the E.U. have long been ambivalent about defining their
interests in the Western Balkans. [Russia has capitalized
on]{.underline} these [years of neglect and leveraged a power
vacuum]{.underline} in the former Yugoslavia [to gain]{.underline}
economic and political [influence. The region is now at the forefront of
Russia\'s]{.underline} use of low-cost [strategies to]{.underline}
expand its global influence and [undermine western
interests]{.underline}. 

[Russian disinformation]{.underline}, aided by repeated cyberattacks on
government institutions, [was instrumental in]{.underline} the
[2016]{.underline} Moscow-sponsored coup attempt [in
Montenegro]{.underline}. In North Macedonia, Russia spread
disinformation prior to the name-change referendum that finally enabled
North Macedonia to join NATO. It also established hundreds of North
Macedonia-based "troll factories,\" from which Russia pedaled fake news
against the 2016 U.S. elections. Facebook recently banned troll farms
from North Macedonia that pushed COVID-19 disinformation. 

Moscow has also been investing in critical sectors in Croatia. With its
strategy of fomenting political divisions, the Kremlin has been
exploiting internal conflicts in Albania. In Bosnia and Herzegovina,
disinformation campaigns have sown ethnic and religious discord,
while promoting the secession of ethnic Serb regions from Bosnia. In
response, the U.S. should encourage the transatlantic integration for
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Western Balkans' most fragile country. 

Russia has used state-sponsored media to promote nationalist and
anti-Western narratives in Serbia, including the opening of
a Sputnik office in Belgrade. Also,  Russian-run "Humanitarian
Center" in Serbia is very close to the main NATO based in Kosovo (Camp
Bondsteel). Some European and American officials fear that it serves as
a base for the Kremlin intelligence-gathering activities to eavesdrop on
U.S. interests in the Balkans. 

[Russia's]{.underline} preeminent [goals in the Balkans have been to
refine their disinformation tactics and erode Western influence in the
region]{.underline}, including in Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia
and Albania, which are all NATO members. [The West needs to aggressively
respond to this Russian posture, including using a cyber-focused
campaign to counter Russia\'s provocations. ]{.underline}

For crafting such a strategy, [the West should look to
Estonia]{.underline}. After the 2007 Russian cyberattack on Estonian
government institutions, [Estonia became a global leader in
cybersecurity and home to the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of
Excellence, which is a cyber-defense hub that supports member nations
with cyber-defense expertise]{.underline}. A similar approach by the
West would benefit the Western Balkans, where information and
communication technology sector is the most promising and the fastest
growing economic sector in the region. In Serbia alone, the I.T. sector
generates more than 10% of GDP with a similar trend in other countries
in the region, which have some of the highest numbers of outsourced I.T.
workers per capita in Europe. 

[An]{.underline} [American-led strategy should focus on creating
a]{.underline} regional [cyber-security infrastructure]{.underline} in
the Western Balkans, [modeled on Estonia\'s example]{.underline}. Given
that countries in the Western Balkans share the same cyber-security
threats from Russia and, more recently, from China, [a]{.underline}
regional [hub for cybersecurity would allow states to cooperate among
each other in cyber deterrence, attribution of attacks and collective
countermeasures]{.underline}. 

Several countries [in the Western Balkans]{.underline} have joined NATO,
but [alliances are]{.underline} notoriously [unreliable]{.underline},
especially among the smaller states. [Countries in the Western Balkans
need strong NATO]{.underline} and E.U. [ties to withstand Russian
influence. Cyber-security is one of the areas where they can strengthen
their positions in allegiance with the western
democracies.]{.underline} 

[The timing is excellent for the U.S. to establish a]{.underline}
regional [cyber-security hub]{.underline} in the Western Balkans.
[Immediate steps need to be taken to halt malign Russian
influence.]{.underline} With elections approaching this year in the
U.S., North Macedonia, Croatia and Montenegro, [countries should
continue cooperating to counter malicious Russian cyber
activities]{.underline}. 

[The U.S. can]{.underline} learn more about Russian cyber tactics at the
same time. One way to send a strong message would be to [deploy a
cyber-team to strengthen NATO's countries' cyber-capabilities in an
effort to thwart future Russian network intrusions]{.underline} such as
the one that was undertaken by Russian intelligence operators in
Bulgaria in 2017. 

Serbia, a key ally to Moscow in the region, remains the biggest obstacle
to countering Russian influence. Serbia just had parliamentary elections
boycotted by the opposition that resulted in Vucic\'s Serbian
Progressive party winning a landslide victory and further strengthening
his power. The close Russia-Serbian relationship can make it difficult
to detect Russia\'s subversive activities. 

Of all the Western Balkans countries, Serbia had the highest military
expenditure in 2019, and President Vucic thanked Russia for making
Serbia's military 10 times stronger since NATO intervention in 1999.
After Russia employed an S-400 missile system in Serbia for a military
drill, the Pantsir S1 air-defense systems were delivered this past
February, despite a looming U.S. sanctions threat.  

Should Serbia continue obtaining Russian weapons, Washington should
impose sanctions. Serbia must understand that its strategy of neutrality
is unacceptable to the U.S., as are its claims to balance their
interests among Russia, China and the West. [The U.S. should remain
solidly committed]{.underline}, leading efforts to solve the Kosovo
dispute and wrest control of that narrative from Russia. 

While variances in the national interests may complicate cooperation
among the Western Balkan [countries]{.underline}, they [share similar
vital objectives that make cooperation possible and]{.underline} even
[attractive under U.S. leadership]{.underline}. Among these are the
historical fear of Russian domination and a desire for E.U. and NATO
membership. [A U.S.-led strategy with NATO country participation to
enhance their cyber-capabilities will improve their security in
countering nefarious Russian influence while enhancing cooperation
between]{.underline} Balkan [nations. ]{.underline}

[Moscow is determined to expand its influence]{.underline} in the
Western Balkans, [using cyber-warfare at the expense of U.S. and western
interests. To prevent it, the U.S. should design a new
strategy]{.underline} for the Western Balkans [that demonstrates that
the U.S. is committed to countering Russia\'s disruptive
activities]{.underline} in the Western Balkans and beyond. The time for
that response is now.

Interoperability for integrated partner resilience

U.S. allies and partners are facing a range of multidomain challenges
and multidimensional asymmetric threats, from cruise missiles to cyber
attacks. Now more than ever, [[effective s]{.mark}ecurity
[c]{.mark}ooperation [is critical to]{.mark} ensure [collective]{.mark}
regional [defense]{.mark}]{.underline}. Just as essential, U.S. national
security strategic guidance calls for revitalized alliances and
partnerships to address shared threats in an era of great power
competition.

Interoperability of U.S. and European forces---the ability to
effectively shoot, move, and communicate together---strengthens regional
deterrence, enhances relationships, and is a powerful component of
foreign policy. [Enhancing multilateral [s]{.mark}ecurity
[c]{.mark}ooperation]{.underline} initiatives in strategic regions, such
as the Black Sea and the Baltics, [is]{.underline} especially [important
to bolster integrated partner resilience]{.underline}. [This helps
enable the U.S. to reduce its military footprint]{.underline} in Europe
[while [enabl]{.mark}ing [NATO allies to]{.mark} steadily [improve
collective defensive capabilities and address]{.mark} [shared]{.mark}
regional [threats]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Security Cooperation Across the Lifecycle

The U.S. European Command and its theater components work together with
partner and allied security forces across the lifecycle of security
cooperation---from planning to implementation, integration, and
sustainment. Through the Offices of Defense Cooperation in each European
capital, our team supports the development and execution of diverse
security cooperation programs. We have broad experience helping increase
partner capability and expanding capacity to mitigate shared security
threats.

Booz Allen plays a key role in a range of critical regional security
cooperation programs in Europe. Here are some key examples:

- We strengthen regional programs to enable integrated air and missile
  defense and maritime domain awareness in the Baltics. These solutions
  leverage low-cost, disruptive, and immersive technologies that are
  scalable, tailorable, and not reliant on expensive proprietary systems
  which become obsolete in a few short years.

- Our experts help multiple European allies and partners develop their
  cyber defense capabilities. The team's work includes recruiting,
  training, and retaining top talent to build and defend critical
  networks and infrastructure. This protects not only U.S. technology
  embedded in increasingly complex weapons systems, but also shared
  coalition networks that support combined operations.

- As a U.S. strategic partner, we support the Ukraine Security
  Assistance Initiative. We're helping Ukraine develop a national
  strategy and focus on areas such as supply chain and logistical
  coordination. In addition, we have played a key role in sustainment
  planning and capacity building. This is a critical priority, as
  Ukraine has received increasingly sophisticated equipment to address
  regional security threats.

Towards a Consistent Response to Disinformation

At the same time, [the West has yet to prepare a coherent, comprehensive
and coordinated response to Russian disinformation. It is up to nations
to fully utilise NATO's potential]{.underline}. A response [practice has
been developed]{.underline} and seen partial success within some states
and Euro-Atlantic institutions, [but]{.underline} it has [not yet been
translated into a real common policy or strategy.]{.underline}

At national levels, [political declarations]{.underline} and agreed
action [plans are still not fully implemented]{.underline} in too many
instances. Western [states approach disinformation in varied
ways]{.underline} due to differences in history, regional security,
wealth, education, media quality, political and legal culture and --
most importantly -- the current state of their relations with Russia. As
a rule, some states prefer bilateral approaches that safeguard national
prerogatives. This may change now following the Russian invasion of
Ukraine.

Nevertheless, the challenge of [disinformation has begun to
attract]{.underline} higher [political attention.]{.underline} In the
European Union, this has transpired through the [adoption of the
European Democracy Action Plan]{.underline}4 [and]{.underline} the
presentation of [new regulations]{.underline} on digital services in
December 2020. These [regulations aim to address]{.underline} the core
issue of the business model developed by [disinformation
organisers]{.underline} who instrumentalise social media platforms. The
report by the Special Committee on Foreign Interference in all
Democratic Processes in the EU, including Disinformation (INGE), has
also promised that other means of influence will be addressed5.

In an effort to combat disinformation, the Digital Services Act (DSA)6
is a breakthrough legal instrument that will fundamentally change the
rules of the game for the information environment in the European Union,
member states and partner countries; it will also have an impact on
national approaches worldwide.7 The DSA will impose numerous legal
obligations on operators of online platforms that are more demanding
than the previous voluntary commitments outlined in the Code of Practice
for Fighting Disinformation. Companies will be obliged to cooperate with
independent researchers and allow them to access their data. They will
also participate in complaint and appeal procedures regarding content
moderation and dispute resolution. The DSA will provide for the
companies' obligatory consultations, including with civil society
organisations. It will also introduce the institution of trusted whistle
blowers, who, among other things, will notify the companies about
suspected crimes online. The act will correspondingly establish a
European Digital Services Council and advisory body made up of national
digital service coordinators responsible for implementing legislation at
the national level. It will impose specific additional duties on
exceptionally large online platforms with more than fortyfive million
users per month. These obligations will include assessing systemic risks
resulting from their services, identifying actions to reduce such risks,
conducting independent audits, setting appropriate conditions for
algorithmic recommendations of user content and ensuring additional
transparency in advertising (including political ads).

Among international organisations and institutions, the European Union
plays a leading role in counteracting disinformation and introducing new
effective measures against it. The future regulations on transparency in
financing political parties and election campaigns gives hope for
limiting corruption and external influence in the affairs of the member
states.8

NATO and the EU share similar membership compositions and were created
based on comparable value systems, so it is reasonable to assume that
counteracting disinformation will be more prominently reflected in
NATO's new Strategic Concept. A need for this has been suggested by the
authors of the NATO2030 expert group report prepared ahead of the Madrid
Summit in June 20229 . As a result, [countering disinformation could be
given a more visible place on the agenda of NATO]{.underline}
ministerial meetings and summits, [and more]{.underline} proposals with
clear [commitments by member states to tackle
disinformation]{.underline} may be unveiled. [NATO]{.underline} also
[has the opportunity to strengthen the mandates of existing committees
to better coordinate national efforts.]{.underline}

Strategic Context

[The Alliance]{.underline}'s new Strategic Concept could therefore
reflect more comprehensively the key tenets of an enhanced approach to
disinformation, encompassing public diplomacy, strategic communication
and social resilience. Such an approach [could also consider new and
innovative tools to combat disinformation, given]{.underline} that
[these]{.underline} can [fit into a broader strategic context of NATO's
work]{.underline}.

In 2019, the Alliance approved not only the first secret military
strategy in over 50 years but also a strategy for developing the
necessary military and technological potential in connection with the
changing nature of conflicts (NATO Warfighting Capstone Concept). With
its stronger deterrence and defence approach to security, NATO began
implementing a policy that enabled the coordinated development of
breakthrough technologies, recognising that technology development will
be a priority in seven areas: (i) artificial intelligence, (ii) advanced
big data analysis, (iii) autonomous technologies, (iv) quantum computing
technologies, (v) biotechnology, (vi) hypersonic capabilities and (vii)
space technologies. In February 2021, the Allies approved the Coherent
Implementation Strategy on Emerging and Disruptive Technologies. Eight
months later, in October, the first NATO strategy on artificial
intelligence was approved. [From the perspective of
disinformation]{.underline} activities, the future of [artificial
intelligence can be seen as a dual-purpose tool]{.underline}. Depending
on human decisions, it can become a sword in the hands of opponents of
freedom or a shield that protects societies and individuals against the
consequences of their actions.

NATO Strategic Concept and Recommendations

[In light of the current security environment in Europe and
worldwide]{.underline}, traditional threats are still a priority, and
[collective defence will remain one of NATO's core
missions]{.underline}, even more so than in the 2010 document.

Among the tasks supporting this existing mission, [there
will]{.underline} also [be development of]{.underline} a full range of
instruments aimed at neutralising [new risks, including
disinformation]{.underline}. As experience has shown, [threats evolve
in]{.underline} terms of [intensity, goals]{.underline}, methods [and
means. The challenge for]{.underline} the negotiators of
[NATO]{.underline}'s new Strategic Concept [will]{.underline} therefore
be to [provide]{.underline} for [adequate flexibility]{.underline} [when
crafting]{.underline} current and future [countermeasures that will
guide the Alliance]{.underline}'s activities [for years to
come]{.underline}.

Overall, [NATO's]{.underline} (and the West's) [coherent
response]{.underline} and efforts [against]{.underline} foreign
[disinformation]{.underline}, both nationally and internationally,
[should focus on]{.underline}: (i) their civic resilience, (ii) their
offensive capabilities as much as their defensive ones and (iii)
[minimising]{.underline} the [differences in how]{.underline} individual
Western [countries approach disinformation]{.underline} in practice. In
other words, deterrence must be pursued through both punishment and
denial. The following recommendations apply specifically to NATO but
also to other organisations that can cooperate more with the Alliance as
well as the member states themselves, for which [NATO can act as a
catalyst in the development of national policies]{.underline} and
practices10.

Ukrainian special forces planning so-called \"false flag\" operations.
The United States considering chemical weapons attacks in the Eastern
European country. NATO preparing to attack Russia during the upcoming
Winter Olympics.

The [Kremlin is ratcheting up its disinformation game]{.underline} with
claims like these [amid rising geopolitical tensions]{.underline}
between Moscow and Western capitals, according to a review of
state-backed media content over the last 10 days by POLITICO.

The campaign --- spread via Moscow-backed outlets like RT, domestic
state-owned broadcasters and fake social media accounts in multiple
Western languages --- coincides with a large-scale military buildup
along the Ukrainian border and increased Western military aide to
support Kyiv.

Moscow\'s goal, according to three Western national security officials
and five external disinformation researchers, is to use wedge issues to
foster division among Western countries over their support for Ukraine;
counter NATO\'s claims against Moscow; and create plausible deniability
over potential atrocities including the possible use of chemical
weapons.

\"[Where they really are moving the needle is on undermining support for
U.S. internationalism,\"]{.underline} said Bret Schafer, head of the
information manipulation team at the German Marshall Fund\'s Alliance
for Securing Democracy, in reference to the Kremlin\'s disinformation
tactics.

\"[Russia state media messaging is more effective at chipping away at
the West\'s geopolitical goals than it is in dividing the West because
we do that well enough on our own]{.underline},\" he added.

In recent weeks, Western governments have been particularly vocal about
outing Russian online tactics. Two of the Western security officials,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss governments\'
internal strategies, said the amped-up response was partly because
Moscow has been successful in tilting public opinion around geopolitical
issues in the past.

The U.S. State Department published a \"cheat sheet\" seeking to explain
the Kremlin\'s online falsehoods, while also criticizing Moscow for its
\"disregard for truth.\" In the European Union, the so-called East
Stratcom team within the European External Action Service, which is
tasked with monitoring Russian online propaganda, highlighted the
Kremlin\'s tactics, although the 27-country bloc is still divided over
how strongly to push back against Moscow.

The Kremlin, in turn, has pushed back against the criticism, claiming
that Western governments and media are peddling mistruths about the
situation in Ukraine, and that it is Moscow, not Washington or Brussels,
that is pushing for a peaceful resolution.

Just like 2014, but worse

Russia is no newcomer to disinformation on Ukraine.

Since the country annexed part of its neighbor in 2014, Kremlin-backed
media has pumped out a steady stream of accusations that Kyiv is run by
neo-Nazis; that NATO is either too weak to defend the country or too
aggressive in its military stance; and that Western citizens did not see
the point in protecting Ukraine.

Those narratives are being updated amid the current tensions.

[Russian broadcasters have shaped the debate at home]{.underline} as
President Vladimir Putin defending the interests of Greater Russia,
including sending Russian troops to Belarus as a routine military
maneuver with a close ally. On the Kremlin\'s [international news
outlets]{.underline} --- which collectively [have millions of followers
on social media]{.underline} --- the likes of RT and Sputnik [have
criticized Western leaders for spending resources on Ukraine amid the
pandemic and questioned how defending Kyiv plays into the national
interests of either the U.S. or EU countries.]{.underline}

\"[The pro-Kremlin disinformation machine uses a well-known tactic of
throwing mud against a wall to see what sticks]{.underline},\" said one
of the Western officials, who was not authorized to speak publicly about
their work tracking Russian online tactics. \"[There are a lot of
contradictions but consistency has never been a strong suit of the
Kremlin\'s disinformation machine]{.underline}. [It's rather about
muddying the waters]{.underline}.\"

For Monika Richter, a former EU official specializing in disinformation
and current head of research at Semantic Visions, a Prague-based
intelligence firm, there\'s a disconnect between domestic propaganda,
which has focused on framing NATO as the enemy and Ukraine as a means to
obtaining security assurances from Washington, and the Kremlin\'s
foreign media operations, which have been more aggressive in claiming
that the West wants war in Eastern Europe.

\"[The outward disinformation campaign is rattling]{.underline},\" she
said. \"It [appears to be]{.underline} a [coordinated effort to lay the
groundwork ahead of another attack.\"]{.underline}

Chemical weapons and blaming NATO

Yet in recent days, specific themes have started to bubble to the
surface.

One relates to accusations --- mostly in non-English-language outlets
--- that either Ukraine or NATO could use chemical weapons within the
country in the hope of blaming Russia for it. These
[messages]{.underline} were then [picked up either by official
diplomatic accounts or American entities like SouthFront]{.underline}
--- a think tank the U.S. State Department has tied to the Kremlin ---
[and shared hundreds of times on social media]{.underline}, according to
POLITICO\'s analysis via CrowdTangle, a social media analytics tool
owned by Meta.

Another is that the West, not Russia, is the main driver in the
potential conflict.

Across RT and Sputnik --- in English, French, German and Spanish ---
reports highlighted how NATO countries had provided weapons to the
Ukrainian government, and claimed that U.S. President Joe Biden was
using the stand-off to boost his popularity at home. In multiple
reports, again heavily shared on social media, RT articles questioned
why the U.S. and Europe were supporting Ukraine when the COVID-19
pandemic was rife at home.

[Russian-backed media]{.underline} has [repeatedly captured significant
attention among Western audiences]{.underline}, particularly those in
Europe where [anti-American sentiment has risen since]{.underline}
[2016]{.underline}, according to the Pew Research Center. But [Kremlin
talking points also have seeped into mainstream U.S. media, particularly
promoted by]{.underline} right-wing influencers who have no affiliation
to Moscow and have tried to use the Ukrainian stand-off [to attack Biden
and his domestic agenda.]{.underline}

That includes raising questions about why Washington would enter the
conflict in the first place, concerns that U.S. involvement in Ukraine
could end similarly to what happened in Afghanistan, and calls for the
Biden administration to focus on domestic, not foreign, issues.

"There's an [alignment of interests between the U.S. far right and the
Russian government]{.underline}," said Schafer of the German Marshall
Fund. \"It\'s [exceptionally beneficial to have super]{.underline}
[mainstream U.S. voices parroting lines]{.underline} that [Russia has
been saying for years]{.underline}."

[and]{.underline} the [agility to adjust and adapt]{.underline} to
ever-changing circumstances [key ingredients of NATO's enduring
success.]{.underline} This strategic narrative, defined by our values
and actions, is the bond, the glue, the foundation that keeps us
together. [Sustaining and protecting that narrative is an essential
aspect of]{.underline} our [Alliance.]{.underline}

Our [narrative is clear and straightforward]{.underline}: [there is no
foundation for decent lives]{.underline}, economic activities, or
fulfillment of individual or collective dreams and ambitions [without
shared security.]{.underline} [There is no way to build a prosperous,
democratic society without ensuring the foundation of
security]{.underline} in the broader sense of that term, [built on our
shared values and freedom]{.underline}. Ensuring this security has been
our raison d'être.

This is our history.

[Still]{.underline}, [history is not static]{.underline}. The
[narrative]{.underline} is [not linear]{.underline}. As we are
witnessing in these challenging times, [history shows NATO responding to
difficult situations]{.underline}, [as well as]{.underline} pleasant and
unpleasant [geopolitical surprises.]{.underline} It has done so by an
[innate yet fragile capacity to adjust]{.underline}, [be
proactive]{.underline}, and [show agility]{.underline}. This is also in
the genes, in the [DNA of]{.underline} our [great
organization]{.underline}. Yet overall this history, the essential
mission remains, that is, to keep 1 billion citizens living in NATO,
allied nations, safe.

This is our story.

[As long as history]{.underline} and nations [exist, there will be some
form of traditional military threat to our security.]{.underline} [NATO
will need to understand and adapt to]{.underline} these conventional
[threats]{.underline}. But we also see today a broader definition of
security. The [pandemic has only accelerated and highlighted this
trend.]{.underline} We see a [considerable spike in the intensity and
scale of hybrid activities]{.underline}, including [increased use of
disinformation and propaganda]{.underline}. If we look at the world now
and into the future, [we see security has become more
complex]{.underline}, [more transversal in this quest for permanent
adaptation.]{.underline}

and Disruptive Technologies,") //chico

The COVID-19 [pandemic]{.underline} is not a consequence of geostrategic
conflict. Never- theless, the pandemic has [had]{.underline} a direct
and [adverse effect on all Alliance nations,]{.underline} particularly
their medical, political, and economic systems. Exploiting this crisis,
several [countries and groups]{.underline} with partisan agendas
attempted to [create a watershed moment in global security]{.underline}
by [undermining Alliance cohesion]{.underline} and national resolve. As
noted by the World Health Organization's (WHO) Director-General at the
2020 Munich Security Conference, "We're not just fighting an epidemic;
we're fighting an [infodemic]{.underline}" (Zarocostas, 2020).

The [COVID-19]{.underline} pandemic [presented an information
exploitation opportunity for]{.underline} some [strategic
actors]{.underline} as part of existing grey zone conflicts. [At the
same time]{.underline}, this [has raised awareness]{.underline} of the
[enduring challenge of countering misinformation, disinfor- mation and
outright propaganda.]{.underline} These attacks can, and have, imposed
considerable costs to the nations and has needlessly increased the death
rate from COVID-19. However, in any complex crisis, such as that
experienced during pandemics, infor- mation transparency and open
communication builds trust and ultimately saves lives.

[Over]{.underline} the initial [phases of]{.underline} the
[COVID]{.underline}-19 crises, [Russian disinformation campaigns
focused]{.underline} on stories such as (EEAS, 2021): COVID-19 was
developed in NATO labo- ratories, global elites are imposing tyranny,
and the EU is disintegrating. As time went on, these attacks expanded to
include those designed to increase doubt on vaccine efficacy, safety and
availability, accusing countries of genocide for not using the Russian
vaccine (Sputnik V), suggesting that migrants (or NATO) have been
spreading the virus across Europe, as well as implying that degenerate
geopolit- ical and commercial interests were over-riding the interests
of European and North American citizens. While some of these attacks are
homegrown, there has also been a trend towards amplifying attacks from
secondary sources (e.g., right & left-wing groups, Iran, ISIS, China,
anti-vaxxers, etc.). This [approach maintains a veneer of plausible
deniability and evades responsibility]{.underline} for accurate
reporting. At the same time, these effor[ts]{.underline} have presented
an [inflated narrative of Russian]{.underline} (and to some extent
Chinese) generosity and scientific, military and societal
[strength]{.underline}. This narrative was supported by logistics and
medical support provided to groups with deep historical and linguistic
ties to Russia or Kremlin-friendly forces (Ozawa, 2020).

In late April of 2020, Russia launched three harmonised disinformation
attacks on NATO (NATO, 2020b). First, a fake letter was published,
purportedly from Jen Stoltenberg, NATO's Secretary-General, to Raimundus
Karoblis, Lithuania's Minister of Defence. The letter noted that NATO
had decided to withdraw its multi- national battlegroup from Lithuania
due to rising COVID-19 infections. The letters were posted on blogs in
English and Lithuanian and were later picked up by various websites and
social media platforms. Fake accounts, created days before, were used to
spread the disinformation further. Following this, an edited YouTube
video was released suggesting that COVID-19 within the multinational
battlegroup was the single agenda item for a recent NATO Defence
Ministers meeting. Finally, the letter was sent directly to NATO
Headquarters via a spoofed NATO e-mail address. Surprisingly, given the
care taken to orchestrate this attack, the letter contained many
formatting, structural and grammatical mistakes, and was recognized
quickly as a fake.

Ultimately the attack was a failure and died out quickly. NATO responded
rapidly to discredit the story, as did the Lithuanian Defence Ministry.
Early identifica- tion (understand) and rapid reaction (engage)
nullified the attack. As noted by the Secretary-General, "They have not
been successful because, first of all, it has been clearly revealed that
this is a fake letter; secondly, we've seen that NATO allies remain
committed, remain united, and are actually helping each other in the
midst of the coronavirus crisis" (NATO, 2020b).

[Disinformation has been a constant threat to the Alliance since its
inception]{.underline}. [Nevertheless, with the increased use of
asymmetric (hybrid) warfare]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the attendant
[growth of social media,]{.underline} [disinformation]{.underline} and
its institutional twin of propaganda [have significantly increased in
volume and precision.]{.underline} Moreover, these efforts are part of
[more significant military and geopolitical trends]{.underline}, such as
those [presented by hybrid]{.underline} or grey zone
[war]{.underline}fare, where success [is defined through operations in
the cognitive sphere.]{.underline}

This [infodemic has presented an existential crisis]{.underline} to
Alliance nations on par with the COVID-19 pandemic itself. Throughout
this crisis, [NATO undertook to sustain its military and political
mission]{.underline}, operations, and activities while maintaining
opera- tional readiness. This included using NATO strategic lift to
ensure medical equipment supplies were delivered to the Alliance and
partner nations. After the initial stages of the pandemic, NATO
developed a refined operational plan, took stock of lessons learned,
restocked medical supplies, identified funding and explored ways and
means to support Alliance and national resilience. These activities
created a solid narrative of an Alliance coming together to support
national COVID-19 responses. [Never- theless,]{.underline} this positive
[narrative]{.underline} was [challenged by misinformation]{.underline},
overt propaganda, and weaponised information campaigns, i.e., targeted
disinformation.

2.4 Countering Disinformation: Engagement in the Cognitive Domain

2.4.1 A Successful Counter-Strategy

Drawing on long experience gained over its seventy-two-year history,
NATO has developed a simple bifurcated strategy for countering
disinformation. This strategy, built upon the classic OODA loop or Boyd
Cycle (observe-orient-decide-act) (Osinga, 2005), consists of understand
(observe-orient) and engage (decide-act) phases. Expanding on this
(NATO, 2020b):

Understand: NATO "Information Environmental Assessments" systematically
track, monitor and assess the information environment germane to NATO
operations or policies. This observe-orient function allows NATO to
identify information attacks and evaluate the impact of
counter-narratives. Engage: Once an attack is understood, a strategic
approach is identified, and a fact-based counter-narrative developed.
Over the longer term, this builds upon the success and lessons learned
from previous disinformation counter-strategies. These
counter-narratives and information products are "fact-based, timely,
transparent and coordinated" (NATO, 2020b). This enables NATO to deliver
a targeted effect within the contested cognitive domain.

The success of these efforts is greatly enhanced when coordinated across
the Alliance. Consistency of message, clarity of meaning, rapid and
agile reaction, and a fact-based counter-narrative are crucial to
building trust and confidence. Ensuring consistency of this narrative
and sharing cognitive domain awareness within the Alliance, EU, UN and
other allies or partners increases the likelihood of countering a
sustained and reactive disinformation campaign while building societal
resilience to such attacks. Nevertheless, there are inevitably groups or
populations resistant to such measures preferring conspiracy theories or
biased narratives. The goal is not to convince everyone but to reach an
audience receptive to a facts-based approach, thereby building trust
within such communities and minimising the damage inflicted by
misinformation, disinformation, or propaganda. In the end, "Sunlight is
said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient
policeman" (Brandeis, 2014).

2.4.2 Understand: Cognitive Domain Situational Awareness (CDSA)

Situational awareness is the key to operational success, or more
generally, success- fully applying the instruments of national power, be
they diplomatic, information, military or economic (DIME) (Worley,
2012). The famous military theorist Sun Tzu noted, "if you know the
enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the results of a hundred
battles" (Tzu, 2018). However, the modern cognitive information battle-
ground exists in a complex web of worldwide intersecting and
interconnected socio- technical networks, with state, non-state actors
and empowered individuals seeking influence and attention. NATO's
cognitive domain situational awareness provides it with actionable
insights, helping to shape its communication response and inform the
nations and partners. To counter disinformation attacks, NATO recommends
that consumers of information: check the credibility of the source;
assess the emotional tone; look for alternate sources, check for
doctored images/video and curb their own biases (NATO, 2020b).

Regarding COVID-19, many state, non-state and agenda-driven individuals
have used the crisis to spread misinformation, disinformation, and
outright propaganda. These efforts are often not accidental or
ill-considered. In many cases, they are delib- erate actions designed to
exploit modern marketing stratagems and are highly devel- oped,
employing sophisticated cyber and psychological warfare approaches. They
seek strategic effects, attempting to provide a (false or misleading)
narrative to create an alternative worldview for calculated impact. Such
attacks are also characterised by inconsistent messaging, rapid
evolutionary improvements based on message success and a shotgun
approach, i.e., wide-area attacks. However, building upon modern
methods, these attacks are also developing in sophistication, becoming
even more targeted and effects oriented as they build upon commercial
approaches, including automation.

State actors, such as Russia, employ a broad spectrum of such approaches
in remarkably sophisticated fashion. Media outlets, controlled by the
Russian govern- ment, such as RT (Russia Today) or Sputnik, use a
broadband strategy of disinfor- mation through a mix of news stories
that blend fact with demonstrable falsehoods (NATO, 2020b). At the same
time, they employ fakes sites, automated bots, and burner accounts to
amplify and normalise narratives while creating momentum and uptake by
other media. These later approaches may be highly targeted at specific
receptive groups defined by ideology, geography, or demographics.
However, the aims of such attacks are long-term and strategic, aiming to
discredit NATO, the nations and Alliance values or the value of the
Alliance. Sadly, in this regard, not much has changed since the cold
war, except the volume, automation and targeting effectiveness of such
disinformation attacks. Trust has always been challenging to build and
harder to maintain.

At the start of the COVID-19 crisis, several actors took the opportunity
to launch disinformation attacks on the Alliance. A surge in such
attacks occurred between March and June of 2020, although the volume and
nature of these attacks morphed over time. To put this in perspective,
from December 2019 to April 2020, over eight thousand cases of
disinformation were noted (Ozawa, 2020) by the European External Action
Service's East StratCom Task Force (European External Action Service,
2021b). A review of the same database for December 2019 to May 2021
notes 11,787 instances of pro-Kremlin disinformation, with approximately
203 related to COVID or the pandemic and 1388 associated with NATO.

2.4.2.1 Russia

The use of disinformation as a Russian strategic weapon was honed during
the cold war. Then again, Russia's skilful use of propaganda and
disinformation goes back to Lenin (Ball, 2017) and arguably even further
back to Potemkin (Montefiore, 2005). Indeed Lenin is quoted as saying,
"A lie told often enough becomes the truth" (DiResta, 2018). Using
disinformation as a strategic tool returned, with a vengeance, following
the ascension of Vladimir Putin. In 2014, Russian---NATO relations were
seriously strained due to the Russian annexation of Crimea. This
territorial appropri- ation was built upon a long campaign of
disinformation in the region (Ball, 2017) as part of the skilful use of
hybrid warfare tactics, which included the use of "little green men"
(Pifer, 2019) to spearhead the process. As noted at the Wales summit in
2014, by General Philip Breedlove, Supreme Allied Commander Europe
(SACEUR) at the time, "\[Russia is conducting\] the most amazing
information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of
information warfare" (Pomerantsev, 2014). Lever- aging new technologies
and social media has enabled highly effective information campaigns
whose implications are only beginning to be appreciated and understood
(Chabuk & Jonas, 2018).

Since that time, [Russian disinformation]{.underline} campaigns have
focused on the predictable goals of [undermining Alliance cohesion and
stability]{.underline}, bring into disrepute NATO's military or
political actions, [spreading panic and undermining democratic
processes]{.underline} (Monaghan, 2020; Ozawa, 2020). Strategically
these efforts are designed to [weaken]{.underline} the economic and
military capability and capacity of the [Alliance]{.underline} while
[creating a multi-polar world order]{.underline} more conducive to
Russian interests as well as leaving Russia and others in a more
advantageous military, economic and political position (Ozawa, 2020). In
the context of [COVID]{.underline}-19, [disinfo]{.underline}rmation
activities that ultimately delay, weaken, prolong, or confuse will
extend and amplify the pandemic and its adverse effects while provoking
panic. This could [eventually undermine soci- etal bonds and degrade the
geopolitical strength of Europe and North America]{.underline}. As noted
(Pomerantsev, 2014), "The [new Russia doesn't just deal in the
petty]{.underline} disinfor- mation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and
[cyber-sabotage usually associated with informa- tion
warfare.]{.underline} It [reinvents reality]{.underline}, [creating mass
hallucinations that]{.underline} then [translate]{.underline} into
[political action]{.underline}." Given the insignificant resource costs
and minimal negative consequences of such a disinformation campaign,
such a [strategy is being pursued vigorously.]{.underline} Consequently,
it is no surprise that the [COVID-19 crisis became just another
opportunity to be exploited.]{.underline}

In Spring 2021, [Latvia was subject to a Russian disinformation
attack]{.underline}, accusing Canadian Forces troops operating in Latvia
of spreading COVID-19 to Latvia (NATO, 2020b). This disinformation
attack consisted of a fake interview, modified screen- shots from the
battlegroup's FaceBook page, and an attempt to solicit a nega- tive
response from the Latvian Minister of Defence through a spoofed
journalist's account.

[Poland was also targeted]{.underline} at the same time (NATO, 2020b).
In this case, a forged letter was planted, via a cyber-attack, on the
Polish War Studies academy's website from Brigadier General Ryszard
Parafianowicz. This letter criticised US forces in Poland, and in
particular, the associated DEFENDER-Europe 20 military exercise. Once
again, multiple blogs and sympathetic media outlets were used to spread
the message, spoofing an e-mail from a former Polish parliamentarian to
Polish media outlets.

While these targeted disinformation attacks were ongoing, in the spring
of 2020, [Russia continued to spread disinformation through]{.underline}
state-influenced or controlled [media]{.underline} channels [on the
nature and scope of NATO exercises in Eastern Europe]{.underline} in the
Spring of 2020 (NATO, 2020b). NATO was accused of continuing to hold
large- scale exercises with no regard for the health and safety of
national populations. [NATO forces were also accused of
i]{.underline}gnoring travel restrictions and safety protocols,
spreading [COVID-19]{.underline} throughout Europe. Starting in early
January of 2020, and perhaps in an even more egregious disinformation
attack, pro-[Kremlin]{.underline} media explic- itly [accused
NATO]{.underline} (and the [US in particular]{.underline}) [of having
engineered]{.underline} the [COVID-19 as a biological warfare
agent]{.underline} in secret laboratories in Latvia, Georgia,
Kazakhstan, Moldova or Ukraine. The COVID-19 pandemic was portrayed as a
"biological Cher- nobyl". As late as May 2020, the Russian Minister of
Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov was quoted as saying, "Washington's
unwillingness to ensure the transparency of its military biological
activities in various parts of the world raises questions about what is
really going on there and what the actual goals are" (NATO, 2020b).

Across all these targeted attacks, NATO worked with the countries
involved to identify and counter the disinformation attempts before they
could gain a foothold within broader media circles (NATO, 2020b). NATO
also provided facts to counter the information wide-area attacks made
through Russian media. In all cases, these have helped build a more
fact-oriented narrative within the Alliance and Eastern Europe more
specifically. However, the impact on counter-NATO narratives within
Russia has perhaps been less successful (e.g. Schaffner & Flood, 2020),
in no small measure due to state control or influence on major media
outlets (Ball, 2017).

These Russian targeted disinformation campaigns follow a broadly similar
pattern (NATO, 2020b). Such attacks employ forgeries (doctored letters,
fake social media posts and bogus interviews), use burner accounts to
create false personas or exploit that of a credible individual, generate
explicit falsehoods and amplification of disin- formation by arms-length
but pro-Russian news and social media sites, engineer leaps from the
originating language to English language media, and spoof e-mails to
NATO, as well as governmental or media sources to provoke a reaction
designed to add fuel to the controversy.

[Russian disinformation has]{.underline} also [taken on a more
threatening tone]{.underline} (NATO, 2020b). In March of 2020, [Russia
offered]{.underline} and deployed [aid supporting Italy's
COVID-19]{.underline} response, [building upon]{.underline} a [narrative
of]{.underline} a responsible global actor reaching out to help Italy in
its hour of need after having been [abandoned]{.underline} by its [NATO
allies]{.underline}. Such [donation diplomacy]{.underline} was arguably
[staged as a pure propaganda exercise]{.underline} (Weiss, 2020). Still,
it must also be noted that NATO and the EU were slow in responding to
Italian requests for aid, thus creating an opportunity to be exploited.
As such, the [Italian government initially welcomed this
assistance]{.underline} as a good-faith gesture. Soon,
[however]{.underline}, [questions were being asked]{.underline} in
mainstream Italian media [about the usefulness of such aid]{.underline},
[initial deployment near a NATO airbase far from the centre of the
outbreak]{.underline} and the potential embedding of GRU agents within
such support (NATO, 2020b; Braw, 2020). Following a strategy of "the
best defence is a good offence", senior [Russian officials condemned the
reporting, accusing the Italian media of spreading false news and
disinformation (]{.underline}NATO, 2020b). The original author of the
critical reporting was threatened on Facebook by the Russian Ministry of
Defence Spokesperson, Igor Konashenkov. Soon after the Spokeswoman for
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Maria
Zakharova, accused multiple US media outlets of spreading disinformation
on Russian COVID mortality rates, threatening action unless the articles
were retracted. In the context of these events, [NATO leadership
reiterated that the fourth estate has a responsibility to check and
assess information on behalf of free societies]{.underline}. [By taking
an open and fact-based approach to disinformation NATO demonstrated its
willingness to put itself under a microscope. Action]{.underline},
ultimately, it is hoped, [speaks louder than words.]{.underline}
Disinformation is a strategic priority within Russia. [Such
disinformation has two strategic objectives. First, Russia's return as a
great power,]{.underline} with a [commensurate return of Russian
influence in Eastern Europe and]{.underline} the [collapse of
NATO]{.underline} as an effective organisation (Ball, 2017). [Second, to
preserve the Putin regime]{.underline} by protecting it from the
contagion of western-oriented revolutions (Ball, 2017). To achieve these
objectives, [a false narrative is presented where]{.underline} the [US
is a demonic military-industrial force for global tyranny]{.underline},
EU members are at each other's throats, Eastern Europe is a hotbed of
ethnic tension, NATO is threatening an imminent attack on Mother Russia,
Ukraine (with a population approximately 28% of Russia) presents a
credible military threat, Alliance democracies have failed to tackle the
COVID crisis and western vaccines are dangerous and produced by corrupt
manufacturers. [This picture is contrasted with a militarily and
politically strong Russia, prepared to counter NATO
aggression]{.underline}, a friend always willing to lend a hand during a
crisis, leading the world in developing COVID-19 vaccines, and providing
an effective national response to the situation. Such a Potemkin
[narrative has real power based on a blend of carefully selected facts,
half-truths, cultural bias, outright falsehoods and wish
fulfilment.]{.underline} Note that while there is an [overarching
strategy to use disinformation]{.underline}, there is also an element of
opportunism. "Putin is not a "cool genius \... His system is
'adhocracy,' in which lackeys do not receive direct instructions but
instead rely on hints and guesses to determine what will please the
boss" (Galeotti, 2019; Lipman, 2019). [Putin is an opportunist without a
master plan]{.underline}, [but with a commitment to restoring Russian
greatness]{.underline}. [Russian actions during the COVID-19 crisis are
simply the most recent example of this ad hockery.]{.underline}

Beyond the COVID-19 crisis, [Russia views disinformation campaigns as a
funda- mental aspect of ongoing grey-zone or hybrid
warfare.]{.underline} In this world, "truth is nego- tiable \... a
popular uprising a fascist coup and \... \[support to\] a Syrian
dictator becomes an anti-terrorist operation" (Ball, 2017). The Russian
Chief of the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, is quoted as saying,
"interstate confrontation's foundation has come to consist of
non-military measures including political, economic, and informational
\... \[Total conflict\] has spread to all spheres of activity in modern
society, diplomatic, scientific, sport, and cultural and, in fact, has
become total in scope" (Ozawa, 2020). This [comment contains the echoes
of a cold-war long thought confined to history.]{.underline}

7.4 "It's Not Just About Russia"

Before diving into specific countermeasures, it is [useful to clarify
one point]{.underline}. Many of the [countermeasures]{.underline}
mentioned below are [based on]{.underline} the author's previous work
regarding [pro-Kremlin disinformation campaigns]{.underline}. While this
approach is specific to Kremlin-based disinformation, [it is applicable
to other actors as Kremlin-based disinformation often serves as a
blueprint for other disinformation campaigns and is often amplified by
other actors.]{.underline} First, the [Kremlin's disinformation
ecosystem is far bigger than]{.underline} commonly
[perceived.]{.underline} Russia is [responsible for]{.underline} roughly
[two thirds of foreign influence efforts documented
globally]{.underline} (Martin et al., 2020). In other words, [Russia
conducts twice as many information op]{.underline}eration[s against
other countries as the rest of the world combined]{.underline}.
Moreover, the [Kremlin controls an astronomical number of disinformation
channels that are not accessible to the majority of other
actors.]{.underline} This [extends farther than just using
"trolls"]{.underline} on social media, but also to [thousands of
information professionals in the Russian government]{.underline},
including [within]{.underline} its [embassies all over the world and its
very active secret services]{.underline}. [Thousands of other
professionals affiliated with the state's "pseudomedia" are also
exporting the Kremlin's disinforma- tion campaigns outside of
Russia]{.underline}, including through both witting and unwitting local
helpers, like certain NGOs and GONGOs (government-organized
non-governmental organizations), extremist politicians (Wesslau, 2016),
etc. (Kalenský, 2019a).

[Russian disinformation campaigns]{.underline} are also [increasingly
focused on "information laundering"]{.underline}, which [blurs the
original source of given information]{.underline}, and instead finds
local sources that [spread the disinformation for them]{.underline}.6
Many [seemingly "domestic" sources]{.underline}, an attribution usually
based on nationality alone and which d[isregards the origin of the
disinformation]{.underline} [they are spreading,]{.underline} are in
fact [just multipliers of the Kremlin's disinformation
campaigns,]{.underline} [knowingly or not.]{.underline} [Such sources
may even be highly respected]{.underline} (Kalenský, 2020b; Weiss &
Goldsmith, 2021), making the impact all the more powerful. As was
recently made public by the US intelligence commu- nity, the [Kremlin
deliberately targets domestic actors to support their influence and
disinformation op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline} (Barnes, 2021).

This [mechanism of information laundering]{.underline} has also been
[present during the COVID]{.underline}-19 infodemic, wherein [Chinese
official sources]{.underline} have [amplified disinforma- tion
narratives]{.underline} [originating in Russia]{.underline}, [giving
them a boost (]{.underline}Semantic Visions, 2020). The [possibilities
available to the Kremlin]{.underline}, an actor that has launched "the
[most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the
history of informa- tion warfare]{.underline}" in 2014 (Vandiver, 2014),
and who [continues to improve its capabilities regarding their
information campaign]{.underline}, [as well as the resultant threat of
these disin- formation campaigns,]{.underline} [are simply incomparable
to the mythical "400-pound person sitting on his bed"]{.underline}
(Calamur, 2018). Moreover, [other actors, in particular, China, are
replicating Kremlin tactics to the degree that researchers now discuss
the "Rus- sianization" of Chinese information
op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline} (Vilmer & Charon, 2020). There is
an [ever-increasing level of cooperation between Russian and Chinese
state pseudo- media]{.underline} (European Values Center, 2021). The
[Kremlin is by far the]{.underline} most aggressive[, experienced,
innovative and emulated disinformation actor in the world right now. The
ease and success with which they conduct their campaigns clearly
inspires other such adversaries to use similar weapons,]{.underline}
even if just on a more limited scale.

### IL\-\--Russia\-\--Ukraine War 

#### Counter-disinformation prevents further escalation of the Ukraine invasion.

"Light will win over darkness." President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine
spoke these words in his stirring address to the United Nations, and
U.S. President Joe Biden cited these same remarks during his State of
the Union address in emphasizing U.S. support for Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir [Putin]{.underline}, on the other hand, [is
placing his bets on darkness]{.underline}. He is [shielding his people
from what is actually happening]{.underline} in Ukraine, the casualties
inflicted by the Ukrainian Army, the mayhem unleashed by Russia on
Ukrainian civilian centers, and the West\'s rationale for inflicting
damaging sanctions. [Increasing Russian access to this
information,]{.underline} however, [could be key to undermining Russian
support for the war and undermining the political standing of
Putin]{.underline}.

Short of an all-out victory against Russian forces by the Ukrainians,
[it could be essential to galvanize public opposition to the war and
impact Putin\'s decision calculus.]{.underline}

This is in part the goal of U.S. and EU sanctions against the Russian
state, which have led the ruble to tumble in value and in turn raised
the cost of living for everyday Russian citizens. Russian casualties,
reaching an estimated 2,000 for the first five days of war, may also
achieve such ends. Casualties and the public grief they inflicted on the
mothers of dead soldiers were crucial in ending Soviet involvement in
Afghanistan. Russian citizens also have long-standing connections with
the Ukrainian people through family ties and shared language and
history, and so they may be particularly sympathetic to the high
civilian death toll in Ukraine.

[Information operations will play a decisive role in this battle.
Information operations cannot fabricate]{.underline} a [nonexistent
reality]{.underline} [so much as crystalize a real truth]{.underline}.
In this case, [information can help]{.underline} the [Russian population
stay focused on]{.underline} the [true cause of sanctions
and]{.underline} the true [cost of war.]{.underline}

[Russia knows this]{.underline}, of course, [and has taken steps to
protect Russians]{.underline} from such content. It has blocked Russian
access to Facebook and Twitter, shut down access to U.S. Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty\'s Russian language news broadcasts, and shuttered
the independent Russian news service Meduza to name a few. It has also
blocked two prominent independent media sites, Echo Moscow and Dozhd,
and has passed laws that criminalize the spreading of "fake news" with
up to 15 years in prison.

[The cracks]{.underline}, however, [are apparent. Russian and Ukrainian
influencers]{.underline} on TikTok [have begun posting
content]{.underline}, even if it is quickly removed, [that expresses
opposition]{.underline} to the war. Anonymous, the hacker group, has
successfully motivated fans on Twitter to start posting anti-war themed
Google reviews of Russian restaurants and outright internet hacks have
defaced Russian government websites with anti-war messages. The
Ukrainians have also gotten in the game, creating a Russian language
website providing information about Russian casualties and POWs.

The United States, European Union, and [NATO]{.underline}, as well as
civil society groups, [could directly support such
efforts]{.underline}---not through the creation of fake social media
accounts, the spread of disinformation, or the conveyance of simplistic
pro-Western messages---but [by supporting the dissemination of accurate
news and information about the war and its cost]{.underline}.

First, [the United States]{.underline} and others [could]{.underline}
get out of the way of those in Ukraine and elsewhere who are applying
innovative methods to inject information into the Russian market. The
Ukrainian information operators are leading the charge with a stunningly
successful information campaign, including by speaking natively in
Russian. However, there may be helpful ways to [provide
assistance]{.underline}, possibly [by amplifying the message across
broadcast channels that can reach Russian audiences. The West
should]{.underline} also [ensure]{.underline} that [Ukrainians retain
the capability to disseminate online content.]{.underline}

[The West could offer assistance and support to online
personalities]{.underline} and influencers [who have access
to]{.underline} the [Russian social media]{.underline} market and reach
out to and support Russian diaspora populations residing in the West who
are intent on passing information to family and friends in Russia.

They could also explore creative ways to promote Russian access to
independent Russian-language media, such as the Latvia-based Medusa,
Ukraine-based sites, or Western-funded media such as Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty.

[The West]{.underline} also [could help sympathetic Russians gain access
to the free internet]{.underline}, possibly [through sharing
access]{.underline} to virtual private network technologies [that can
break through]{.underline} the [firewalls]{.underline} installed by the
Russian government.

[Russia has taken]{.underline} increasingly aggressive [actions to
restrict access of information]{.underline} about the war in Ukraine.
[The United States and the West could help neutralize this by developing
new techniques for ensuring Russian access to accurate and truthful
information. Ensuring]{.underline} that the [Russian people know the
truth]{.underline} about what their government is doing in Ukraine
[could bring this war to an end soon rather than later]{.underline}. To
quote a verse from Ecclesiastes, "Wisdom has an advantage over folly, as
the advantage of light over darkness."

If the first casualty of war is truth, then the corollary [in
Ukraine]{.underline} is that [information is the first
battlefield]{.underline}.

That was where the war began, in early 2022, weeks before Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline} sent the first rockets, armored vehicles and troops
into Ukraine, when he [claimed]{.underline} that the massive [buildup of
troops]{.underline} along Ukraine's borders [was]{.underline} but
[another military exercise]{.underline}. And that was where the United
States and its allies scored their first victories, when they made
public intelligence anticipating the invasion and the pretext Mr. Putin
would use for it.

Then, when the invasion began in February, Ukraine's president,
Volodymyr [Zelensky, opened a second information front]{.underline}. He
donned a soldier's olive-drab T-shirt and issued a torrent of defiant
tweets, speeches and images from devastated villages, much of it
targeted at Russian audiences. [His metamorphosis from]{.underline} a
relatively [unpopular]{.underline} president [to a David defying Goliath
has been instrumental in solidifying popular]{.underline}, military and
economic [support]{.underline} for Ukraine in the United States and
Europe.

In these first information battles, the Americans and Ukrainians showed
that they had learned the lessons of 2014, when Russia had the upper
hand in propaganda, assaulting Crimea and eastern Ukraine while claiming
to be responding to pleas from Russian-speaking residents. The United
States and Ukraine have also been greatly aided this time around by the
fact that the evidence of the invasion and its brutal consequences has
been so well documented.

But [the information war]{.underline}, like the physical war, [is far
from decided]{.underline}. Ten weeks into the war, [many
Russians]{.underline} seem to [accept]{.underline} Mr. [Putin's
narrative]{.underline}. Around the world, [many countries remain on the
sidelines or, like China, are on Russia's side]{.underline}. While
[Washington's]{.underline} public [comments]{.underline} have served to
bolster the Ukrainians and rally their allies, [some]{.underline} of
those [comments have played directly into]{.underline} Mr. [Putin's
claims of a malign America]{.underline} determined to neuter Russia, as
when President Biden said of Mr. Putin, "This man cannot remain in
power," and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin declared that America's goal
is a "weakened" Russia.

[Russia]{.underline} was surprisingly slow to prepare its population or
the world for a full-scale invasion, perhaps because its leaders were
convinced that Kyiv would fall quickly. But after that slow start, the
Kremlin went into high gear. Domestically, it [shut down independent
media outlets, quashed demonstrations and threatened anyone challenging
the government line with "false information"]{.underline} about the
invasion with up to 15 years in prison.

[Russia was]{.underline} also [quick to adapt]{.underline} its
[messaging to a changing battlefield]{.underline}. After Moscow shifted
its focus from Kyiv to southeastern Ukraine, the [goal of driving Nazis
out of]{.underline} power in [Kyiv shifted to a focus on Ukraine as
a]{.underline}n existential [struggle]{.underline} for Holy Russia
[against]{.underline} an [American hegemon and]{.underline} its
[NATO]{.underline} sidekicks. What began as a "special military
operation" has morphed into a defensive war akin to World War II, the
"Great Patriotic War," in which Russia was last compelled to defend
itself against Nazis and fascists.

"We broke the back of fascism," declared Patriarch Kirill, the head of
the Russian Orthodox Church and a staunch supporter of the war against
Ukraine, in a sermon on April 3 that turned an unprovoked invasion into
a noble crusade. On May 3 he ratcheted up the language: "We don't want
to fight anyone," he said in a sermon in the Kremlin. "Russia has never
attacked anyone. It is amazing that a great and powerful country never
attacked anyone; it only defended its borders."

How many Russians really believe this is hard to gauge, given the danger
of disagreeing. There is [considerable]{.underline} anecdotal
[evidence]{.underline} that [the notions of a hostile NATO]{.underline}
and treacherous Ukrainians [are widely held, but there are
also]{.underline} many [reports of Russians horrified by the war but no
longer able to speak out without immediate repression.]{.underline}

[The info war has]{.underline} also [reached Asia, Africa and South
America, where Russia has mobilized diplomats and state-controlled
media]{.underline} like the global RT network [to press its case. The
goal is]{.underline}n't necessarily to win support, but [to keep
unaligned countries on the sidelines]{.underline}. While some
[countries]{.underline}, most notably China, have taken Russia's side,
others, like India, [have avoided antagonizing Russia]{.underline} so as
not to lose Russian military or energy contracts.

Many others have done so simply because they know and care little about
Ukraine. Russia's line to them is that it is fighting to prevent the
United States from creating a unipolar world that would swallow their
country, with no one to support their interests. The strategy evoked
memories of the assistance the Soviet Union gave to Vietnam, Angola and
other postcolonial independence movements.

The United States has mounted its own diplomatic efforts to gain more
support from countries like India and South Africa. And Ukraine recently
posted a video on Twitter recently in which the commander of Ukrainian
armed forces thanks 37 countries that, according to the tweet, have
shown "assistance and unwavering support in these hard times." The list
is not entirely fair --- some Asian countries missing from the list have
provided nonlethal assistance --- but it is still noteworthy that there
were no entries from Africa or South America.

As the war rages on, attention in the United States and elsewhere is
bound to flag, and questions about the impact of the war on energy and
food prices worldwide are bound to intensify. A speech by Mr. Biden on
Tuesday on the need to support Ukraine was lost in the brouhaha over the
leak of a Supreme Court draft ruling. And the \$33 billion he is seeking
in military assistance and other aid for Ukraine is certain to meet
resistance, especially since there is no idea when or how the war might
end.

[Dwindling Western commitment is part of]{.underline} Mr. [Putin's
calculus]{.underline}. Though he seems to have misjudged the West's fury
and response to his invasion, his 22 years of increasingly autocratic
rule have taught him that passions invariably wane and high costs erode
commitment.

[As]{.underline} a [former K.G.B.]{.underline} agent, Mr. [Putin sees
the world as a battleground of conspiratorial maneuvers]{.underline}. In
his speeches, the color revolutions in Ukraine and other former Soviet
republics and the Arab Spring and other global upheavals are
machinations to bolster American domination. As an heir to the Soviet
worldview, [he believes]{.underline} more than many Western leaders do
[in the importance of information warfare]{.underline}, both [to give
his regime a veneer of legitimacy and to challenge liberal
democracy]{.underline}. On this battlefield, lies are ammunition in Mr.
Putin's long and increasingly personal struggle to stay in power.

[As the war enters a new phase]{.underline}, as the images and horrors
become familiar and the costs rise, [it will become ever more difficult
for]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline} administration and for Mr.
Zelensky [to sustain their]{.underline} early [lead in the information
war]{.underline}. That makes it all the more imperative for the West to
press the message that this is not a war Ukraine chose and that the cost
of allowing Mr. Putin to have his way in Ukraine would be far higher
than the sacrifices required to block him.

#### Russia is [winning]{.underline} the Ukraine info war NOT the other way around.

The [[West]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[proclaimed Ukraine's victory
in]{.mark} the [info]{.mark}rmation [war]{.mark}]{.underline}. Memes
like the Ghost of Kyiv and the soldiers of Snake Island, impassioned
speeches by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, horrific images of
Russian-wrought destruction, photos of millions of Ukrainians fleeing
their homes, and tales of Miss Ukraine laying down her tiara and picking
up a machine gun beside millions of her countrymen have captivated the
West. No doubt this narrative is partially responsible for the
outpouring of Western munitions and military assistance to Ukraine,
sanctions against Russia, and aid to displaced Ukrainians. If the
objective of Ukraine's information war was to gain sympathy and
assistance from the West, Ukraine has certainly succeeded.

[[However]{.mark}, the [info]{.mark}rmation [war has more than
just]{.mark} a [Western front]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the West
dismisses Russian narratives, [[other]{.mark} influential [actors are
listening and embracing]{.mark} them. [Russia's narrative]{.mark} is
carrying sway [in]{.mark}]{.underline} the developing world and in
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} -- and some of its disinformation is being
parroted by conspiracy theorists within the U.S. [[Russia's]{.mark} war
[disinfo]{.mark}rmation will [have consequences]{.mark} for
international relations [long after the war. The West]{.mark}
must]{.underline} act to [counter it.]{.underline}

The [Global South [has been reluctant to]{.mark} condemn
Russia]{.underline} for the war [and]{.underline} to [[counter]{.mark}
its [disinfo]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}. Forty countries did not
support the UN General Assembly's extraordinary resolution condemning
the Russia invasion of Ukraine. Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, and Syria
chose to stand with Russia. The 35 abstentions unsurprisingly included
China and Iran, but also included India, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, South
Africa, South Sudan, and Vietnam---states which the U.S. has supported
or had partnerships, or warmed relations with in recent years. The U.S.
has been dismayed by many African states' refusal to condemn the
conflict, causing a strain in their relationships. A total of 17 African
nations abstained on the UN General Assembly vote, and eight were
absent. Of the 28 African states that supported the resolution, none
elaborated on their position, with the notable exception of an
impassioned anti-colonialist speech by the Kenyan ambassador. South
Africa's President, Cyrial Ramaphosa, has continued to parrot the
Russian official position that it perceived a "national existential
threat" from NATO and has criticized NATO's rumored expansion into
Ukraine. Correspondingly, a [social media [analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}
conducted in mid-March by the firm CASM Technology has
[[found]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[pro-Russian narratives]{.mark} are
[trending in language groups]{.mark}]{.underline} found in much of South
Asia, South Africa, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Iran. [[Putin]{.mark} appears
to be [targeting]{.mark}]{.underline} these [countries with his message
[to gain influence]{.mark}]{.underline} there. [Based on]{.underline}
their [leaders' positions, it [appears to be
working]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, which more tightly controls its Internet
than any other country in the world, [[has relentlessly promoted
Moscow's narrative]{.underline}]{.mark}. While [China]{.underline} may
be officially ambiguous about its support for Putin's war, its
[state-controlled media lays its position bare]{.underline}. China and
Russia resolved to strengthen their cooperation in media in 2015, and
the war has shown the success of this initiative. Within hours of the
invasion on February 24, the Chinese Communist Party's Global Times
posted a video saying that a large number of Ukrainian soldiers had
surrendered, citing the Russian state-controlled media network RT.
China's state Central Television Station (CCTV) then promptly reported
and spread on social media that Zelenskyy had fled Kyiv. [Chinese
media]{.underline} has [repeated Russia's positions that the war
opposes]{.underline} the West, NATO expansion, [Nazisim, and fascism,
and is]{.underline} therefore [justified]{.underline}. Meanwhile,
[it]{.underline} has [reported that Ukraine is using civilians as human
shields and torturing captured soldiers]{.underline}. Perhaps most
dangerously for the U.S., [Chinese government officials has spread
Russia's claims that the Pentagon was financing biological weapons in
Ukraine]{.underline}. Chinese government officials repeated the
conspiracy theory at news conferences, in the press, and on official
social media accounts---in Chinese, Arabic and English. The White House
called out both countries for their coordinated disinformation campaign
and expressed concern that they might be providing cover for a Russian
biological or chemical weapons attack. [Conspiracy [theorists]{.mark}
with[in the U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[picked up
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the lab [[disinfo]{.mark}rmation
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} begun to [[spin it]{.mark} for their own
propaganda campaigns]{.underline}, including Fox News host Tucker
Carlson and QAnon followers. Journalist and national security critic
Glenn Greenwald has opined that the theory might be true.

[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} has achieved important strategic and
military objectives through its information campaigns, and has rightly
convinced most of the world of the morality of its cause. However, is
[has [lost]{.mark} some [important info]{.mark}rmation [battles]{.mark}.
Russia]{.underline} has [won]{.underline} important information battles
[in China, India, and]{.underline} most of [Africa]{.underline}. And
since [the [info]{.mark}rmation [war will]{.mark} go on long
after]{.underline} the [shooting stops, Russia's victories [have
ramifications]{.mark} for international relations [going
forward]{.mark}. States]{.underline} who continue to buy into the
Russian narrative [may continue to have strained relationships with the
U.S. and the West]{.underline}. As the U.S. and its NATO allies strive
to develop stronger relationships with resource-rich African states---in
no small part so they can reduce resource dependence on Russia and
China, they may find that they are not trusted as political and business
partners. The Russian narrative may also harm the U.S.'s long quest for
greater security cooperation with India.

#### Ukraine is a target of [information warfare]{.underline} -- it's a "[crystal ball]{.underline}" for future problems

UNITED NATIONS --- A Google executive warned the U.N. Security Council
Tuesday that [cyberattacks]{.underline}, [disinformation]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} other forms of [information warfare]{.underline}
[being waged in Ukraine are a]{.underline} ["crystal ball"]{.underline}
[for future problems]{.underline} elsewhere.

"[States must find a way to turn the volume down and settle on
some]{.underline} kind of [deterrence doctrine for the cyber
domain]{.underline}," Jared Cohen said at a council meeting on hate
speech, incitement and atrocities in Ukraine.

He argued that [while tech companies have needed expertise]{.underline},
"[there is no]{.underline} magical algorithm or [single fix for
this]{.underline}," and [finding a solution will take]{.underline} a lot
of [experimentation]{.underline}.

Cohen heads Jigsaw, a part of Google that aims to build technology to
combat disinformation, censorship and extremism online.

He said [Ukraine]{.underline} "[has been]{.underline}
[disproportionately targeted]{.underline}" [by advanced cyberattacks
since Russia's annexation of Crimea]{.underline} in 2014, adding: "[It
is essentially our crystal ball for what is likely to
come]{.underline}."

[The war in Ukraine upped pressure on tech companies to]{.underline}
work harder to [combat hate speech]{.underline},
[disinformation]{.underline} [and other harmful content]{.underline}
online. [The E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [is working on
sweeping new rules that would require]{.underline} Google, Facebook
parent Meta and other [tech giants to police their platforms more
strictly]{.underline}.

[Western powers on the Security Council]{.underline} have [accused
Russia of a campaign of propaganda, disinformation and hate directed at
undermining Ukraine]{.underline}. A recent report from Mandiant, a cyber
security firm, found that [Russia used disinformation, fear and
propaganda to demoralize Ukraine and divide its allies]{.underline}.

"[Hate speech can also be a war crime]{.underline}," British deputy U.N.
Ambassador James Kariuki said Tuesday, [calling on Russia to "stop
making such statements."]{.underline}

Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia repeated his country's counterclaims
that Ukrainian authorities' rhetoric has poisoned citizens against
Russia and Russian-speaking populations in Ukraine, with Western
encouragement.

"We see, from our side, a real incitement to violence and Russophobia in
Ukraine," he said.

Albania, which currently holds the council's rotating presidency, called
for Tuesday's meeting.

### IL\-\--Russia\-\--Baltics 

#### Russia will use information warfare tactics to justify an invasion of the Baltics - absent information warfare capabilities the attack fails but if not, it quickly escalates because it activates Article 5

Brent M. **Eastwood 22,** Now serving as 1945s New Defense and National

Ukraine: Could Russia Invade And Conquer The Baltic States?\"
https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/01/forget-ukraine-could-russia-invade-and-conquer-the-baltic-states/
//AShah

[[We're Focused on Ukraine But Look Out For the Russian Threat to the
Baltics]{.underline}]{.mark}: It was a shot heard around the world in
the Russian military analysis community. A RAND Corporation simulated
wargame in 2016 concluded that the Russian military could reach the
suburbs of the Estonian and Latvian capitals of Tallinn and Riga in less
than 60 hours. In the iterations of the exercise, the Estonians and
Latvians would need at least seven brigades of troops that include at
least three armored brigades to potentially fight the Russians to a
standstill.

But it gets worse from here. In another RAND wargame in 2019, the
players examined if NATO and Russia would use tactical nuclear weapons
during a simulated war in the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania). The scenario also had Russian conventional forces
over-running capitals in the Balkans and NATO having the last fail-safe
option to use non-strategic nuclear weapons.

What Type of Warfare Could the Russians Use Against the Baltics?

A widespread fear is that [[the Kremlin could use hybrid
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} (conventional and unconventional aspects of
power projection) [again [to annex parts of the
Baltics]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [which would trigger Article V with NATO
allies]{.underline}]{.mark} and would require a military response
against the Russians from NATO members. A glance at a map will tell you
that St. Petersburg is dangerously close to Tallinn, Estonia and Riga,
Latvia. But according to General Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of the
General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia, [the distinctions between
offensive aspects of war and defensive aspects of war are
blurring.]{.underline}

Under this Gerasimov Doctrine, [[the Kremlin then could engineer a
Russian]{.mark} hybrid [incursion]{.mark} of cyber and [information
warfare attacks against the Baltics]{.mark}, and [these tactics could
be]{.mark} made to be [seen as a defensive
operation.]{.mark}]{.underline} Since the Baltics have ethnic Russians
as part of the population, [[Moscow could employ special operations
forces]{.mark} as peacekeepers [to protect
compatriots.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[This could happen with an
information warfare campaign that would increase]{.mark} the chances for
[protest]{.mark} and other domestic unrest [with ethnic Russians as
victims]{.mark} in the Baltics. [Then a hybrid operation would ensue to
protect ethnic Russians.]{.mark}]{.underline}

According to the two RAND sets of wargames, [[the Russians would then
bring in the]{.mark} heavy armored and mechanized [infantry]{.mark}
units [to "teach the Baltics a lesson."]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Russian invasion of the Baltics causes nuclear war

https://www.aei.org/op-eds/how-russia-could-force-a-nuclear-war-in-the-baltics/
//AShah

Would the US fight a nuclear war to save Estonia? The question would
probably strike most Americans as absurd. Certainly, almost no one was
thinking about such a prospect when NATO expanded to include the Baltic
states back in 2004.

Yet a series of reports by the nonpartisan RAND Corporation shows that
[[the possibility of nuclear escalation in a conflict between]{.mark}
the [N]{.mark}orth [A]{.mark}tlantic [T]{.mark}reaty
[O]{.mark}rganization [and Russia over the Baltic]{.mark} region [is
high]{.mark}er than one might imagine.]{.underline} The best way of
averting it? Invest more in the alliance's conventional defense.

There was a time when it seemed quite normal to risk nuclear war over
the sanctity of European frontiers. During the Cold War, NATO was
outnumbered by Warsaw Pact forces, and it would have had great
difficulty stopping a Soviet attack with conventional weapons. [From the
moment it was formed, NATO relied on the threat of nuclear escalation
--- whether rapid and spasmodic, or gradual and controlled --- to
maintain deterrence.]{.underline} American thinkers developed elaborate
models and theories of deterrence. [US and NATO forces regularly carried
out exercises simulating the resort to nuclear weapons to make this
strategy credible.]{.underline}

[After the Cold War ended, the US and its allies had the luxury of
thinking less about nuclear deterrence and war-fighting.]{.underline}
Tensions with Russia receded and nuclear strategy came to seem like a
relic of a bygone era. [Yet today, [with Russia rising again as a
military threat, the]{.mark} grim [logic of nuclear statecraft is
returning.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The spike in tensions between Russia and the West over the past
half-decade has revealed a basic problem: [[NATO doesn't have the
capability to prevent Russia]{.mark}n forces [from]{.mark} quickly
[overrunning Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[Russian invaders would be at the gates of the Baltic capitals in two to
three days; existing NATO forces in the region would be destroyed or
swept aside. NATO could respond by mobilizing for a longer war to
liberate the Baltic countries, but this would require a bloody,
dangerous military campaign. Critically, that campaign would require
striking targets --- such as air defense systems --- located within
Russia itself, as well as suppressing Russian artillery, short-range
missiles and other capabilities within the Kaliningrad enclave, which is
situated behind NATO's front lines.]{.underline}

Moreover, this sort of NATO counteroffensive is precisely the situation
Russian nuclear doctrine seems meant to avert. [[Russian officials
understand that their country would lose a long war against
NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline} They are particularly alarmed at the
possibility of NATO using its unmatched military capabilities to conduct
conventional strikes within Russian borders. So [[the Kremlin has
signaled that it might carry out limited nuclear
strikes]{.underline}]{.mark} --- perhaps a "demonstration strike"
somewhere in the Atlantic, or against NATO forces in the theater ---
[[to force the alliance to make peace]{.mark} on Moscow's
terms.]{.underline} This concept is known as "escalate to de-escalate,"
and there is a growing body of evidence that the Russians are serious
about it.

A [[NATO-Russia war could]{.mark} thus [go nuclear if Russia "escalates"
to preserve the gains it has won early in the conflict.]{.mark} [It
could also go nuclear]{.mark} in a second,]{.underline} if somewhat less
likely, way: [[If the U.S. and NATO initiate their own limited nuclear
strikes against Russian forces to prevent Moscow from overrunning the
Baltic allies in the first place]{.underline}.]{.mark} And even the
limited use of nuclear weapons raises the question of further
escalation: [Would [crossing the nuclear threshold lead]{.mark}, through
deliberate choice or miscalculation, [to a general nuclear war involving
i]{.mark}nter[c]{.mark}ontinental [b]{.mark}allistic
[m]{.mark}issile[s]{.mark}, strategic bombers and apocalyptic
destruction?]{.underline}

5 Conclusions

[Information superiority is considered essential to achieving victory on
the physical battlefield]{.underline} in modern war. [Information
operations]{.underline}, for which it is difficult to attribute
responsibility and which are not specifically regulated by international
law, fall below the threshold of armed conflict and are convenient to be
used to destabilize a government or to try to legitimize a (unlawful)
action.

[The Kremlin has developed information capabilities]{.underline},
clustered under the umbrella concept of "hybrid warfare", [that make a
fundamental contribution to]{.underline} accomplish [foreign policy
goals.]{.underline} [Disinformation, propaganda, and cyber]{.underline}
capabilities [have been employed in Russian influence campaigns to
support a]{.underline} new [nationalist ideology]{.underline}. The
Russian strategy makes a large use of media outlets to inspire
nationalist Russian sentiment and identify loyalists and supporters.

Through flag propaganda operations, [the Russian Federation has caused
political instability and poisoned bordering countries with the purpose
to regain regional dominance and counteract the enlargement of Western
powers]{.underline}. It is expected that [Moscow will continue to use
this strategy that]{.underline}, so far, [was successful to weaken
neighbouring nations and increase its regional influence]{.underline}.

To be effective the hybrid strategy of Moscow, which makes extensive use
of information and psychological operations, requires a combination of
favourable circumstances: the presence of ethnic Russian and
Russian-speaking population on foreign soil and the border with Russia,
that is necessary for military intervention. Without both requirements
Moscow's strategy is ineffective and represents neither a deterrent nor
a real threat.

Armed insurgency, [[Russia\'s main]{.mark} kinetic [HW]{.mark}
[tool]{.mark} against Ukraine, [was instigated and backed by massive
information warfare]{.mark} since it\'s inception.]{.underline} The
rebels, who are mostly mobilized, trained, and armed by the Russian
special services, and further supported by the Russian armed forces,
have been destabilizing Donetsk and Luhansk regions since February 2014.
The crisis started to unfold after the pro-Russian former president
Yanukovich was forced to flee to Russia as a result of the revolutionary
rally in Kiev over his decision to hinder Ukraine\'s association with
the EU. The mass protests in Kiev\'s Maidan Square, which brought the
new pro-European government to power, demonstrated the unequivocal
support of the vast majority - 90% according to some polls - of the
Western Ukrainians for European integration (IRI, 2014). In response to
the undesired change of the government in Ukraine (GoU), [[Russia
launched an aggressive information campaign blaming the government
for]{.mark} alleged [violations of the rights of the Russian speaking
minorities]{.mark} in the country.]{.underline} [[Using this
narrative]{.mark}, predominantly [Russian-speaking Crimea was officially
annexed by Russia, and Russian special services started to organize
separatist outbreaks in Donbas.]{.mark}]{.underline} For these purposes,
Russia used the dissatisfaction of the Russian speaking Ukrainians with
the new government\'s attempt to drop the law making Russian the
official second language of Ukraine.

Notably, the linguistic divide between the population of the western and
eastern regions of Ukraine is reflected in political preferences on the
part of the population. According to the opinion polls conducted by the
Kiev\'s International Institute of Sociology, 72.5% of the population of
Donetsk region are in favor of integration of Ukraine into the
Russian-led Customs Union as opposed to the 9.4% supporting EU
integration (Zn. ua, 2014). The regional differences with regard to
foreign policy orientation, also stimulated and well exploited by
Russian propaganda, can be seen as the main source of the political
disagreement between eastern and western Ukraine. [[As a result of
effective information warfare conducted by Russia and the pro-Russian
separatists on the ground, they were able to manipulate]{.mark} with the
divides among the population against Ukraine\'s integration into the
European and Euro-Atlantic [structures by provoking violent conflict in
Donbas without even having mass support.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Remarkably, unlike Ukraine, there has never been a significant Russian
native speaking or ethnic minority in Georgia. According to the 2002
census published by the European Center for Minority Issues, there is a
total of 1.5% Russians living on the territory of Georgia (EUMM, 2014).
Therefore, to rationalize the narrative of protecting Russians abroad,\'
Moscow has since 2002 mass distributed Russian passports in both
occupied regions of Georgia. According to various media sources,
accepting Russian citizenship was mandatory for permanent residents in
the occupied territories and was forcefully executed by local police
units. In other words, as opposed to Ukrainian case, where Russia used
existing linguistic divides to instigate separatism, in Georgia it
created artificial citizens through an illegal "passportization\'
process in order to justify the 2008 invasion of Georgia. The narrative
that was used by Kremlin to justify the aggression after the 5 days war
was blaming Georgia for initiating the conflict by using force against
Russian citizens in Tskhinvaly region, thus compelling Russia to respond
with the "peace enforcement\" operation. [This analysis is very
important to once again underscore that [smaller and weaker states
failed to deter realization of obvious patterns of Kremlin\'s HW]{.mark}
and counter its strategic narratives, such as the right to protect
interests of Russians abroad.]{.underline} As evidenced in both Ukraine
and Georgia[, [Russia is using a new type of H]{.mark}ybrid
[W]{.mark}arfare [to achieve its goals through controlling proxies on
the ground supported by the massive information
warfare]{.mark}.]{.underline} In both cases
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, without having solid grounds, [[succeeded
to materialize aggression]{.mark} through engineering new realities,
[which constitute dangerous precedents that]{.mark} [can be]{.mark}
repeatedly [used against]{.mark} Georgia and [other vulnerable
countries]{.mark} in future.]{.underline}

[The War on Liberal Democracy and Western Dominance]{.underline}

Amid new and continuing global issues and conflicts, [Russia wants to
remain at the forefront of the creation and implementation of possible
solutions]{.underline}. [[The Kremlin believes the U.S]{.mark}. and its
allies [are]{.mark} continuously [working to isolate Russia and
undermine Russian interests]{.mark}.]{.underline} These sentiments are
perfectly stated in the National Security Strategy of the Russian
Federation:

"The strengthening of Russia is taking place against a backdrop of new
threats to national security that are of a multifarious and
interconnected nature. The Russian Federation's implementation of an
independent foreign and domestic policy is giving rise to opposition
from the U.S. and its allies, who are seeking to retain their dominance
in world affairs. The policy of containing Russia that they are
implementing envisions the exertion of political, economic, military,
and informational pressure on it.\[21\]"

[[Russia's policy]{.mark} not only [communicates a
responsibility]{.mark} to protect its citizens and Russian culture, but
also [to combat the U.S.-led unipolar system]{.mark} and persuade others
to do the same.]{.underline}

In practice, [Russia uses this strategy to justify its operations
abroad]{.underline}. As an opponent of the U.S.-centric order, [Russia
paints itself as a sort of hero for those who are frustrated with the
U.S.-led unipolar system]{.underline}. The U.S. Senate 2018 report on
Russia's actions outlines the real objectives and asymmetric cyber
tactics of Putin's regime. It argues that the regime's overarching goal
is the protection of its own power and stability through the expansion
of Russian hegemony in various sectors.

[Analysis of known [Russian information operations]{.mark} in Western
democracies [illuminates three]{.mark} key overarching
[objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}: [[to discredit]{.mark} trusted
[democratic institutions, to divide the Western coalition, and to
undermine the]{.mark} supranational organizations that uphold and
promote these [democratic values]{.mark}.\[]{.underline}22\] Following a
short stint with democracy in the 1990's that coincided with national
embarrassment, soaring levels of poverty, widespread corruption, war,
and instability; [Putin has rebuilt the country without a vision of
democracy]{.underline}. Modern Russia provides a model for an
alternative form of governance, one that is focused on information
sovereignty, and promotes traditionalism, nationalism, and
authoritarianism. [Western ideals and democratic values naturally run
contrary to Putin's own more autocratic vision]{.underline}. [The
current international order]{.underline}, upheld by the U.S. and its
allies, is critical of modern Russia and united, [hinders Putin's
ability to implement his agenda at home and abroad]{.underline}.\[23\]
For this reason, the current international order is a constant hindrance
and security threat to Putin's form of government. In addition, Russia's
history of invasion from Western Europe motivates its distrust of the
west and of NATO's effect on global politics.\[24\]

In most Western democracies, [[racism]{.underline}]{.mark} and fears
about immigration [[create fertile ground for manipulation]{.underline}.
[These fears have been targeted by Russian information campaigns to sway
the outcome of elections]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[25\] European
democracies and the U.S. face all forms of information warfare and free
and fair elections are consistently targeted. [[Russia hopes to
radicalize the populace]{.mark} in these countries, [creating]{.mark}
not only [instability and polarization, but also weak
governments]{.mark}.]{.underline} Large supranational blocks such as the
EU can have a drastic impact on Russia's economy by implementing
sanctions and forming a collective front against potential military
action. For this reason, [a large part of Russia's overarching
international policy is focused on disrupting the unity between Western
democracies.]{.underline}\[26\]

//AShah

[Our aim was to explain populist attitudes]{.underline} (that may
eventually lead to populist votes) [by a number of factors, the most
important being the degree of social polarization]{.underline}, which
measures the extent of social divides that plague our societies.
[[Polarization is]{.mark} [significantly positively correlated
with]{.mark} all four [populist attitudes]{.mark}]{.underline},
particularly when immigration inflows are treated as an endogenous
variable and the model is estimated using IV-2SLS. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to correlate populism using such
indicators of polarization that reflect the socioeconomic divides better
than standard measures of inequality or poverty.

To compute our measure of social polarization, in each country we
fractionalize population into three groups, low, middle and high income.
The distances between the income groups are the ratios of people
experiencing either difficulties 'to make ends meet,' or 'material
deprivation'.

We show that [[social polarization varies dramatically across
Europe]{.mark}an regions]{.underline}. The highest scores are found in
Southern and Eastern countries and the lowest scores in Northern
countries, but at the same time, some convergence is observed. Our
estimations confirm, in most cases, [[a positive]{.mark} and
statistically [significant relation between social polarization and
populist attitudes.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Furthermore, our results confirm the effect of immigration inflows on
populist attitudes. The only exception, unexpectedly, is the effect of
immigration on anti-immigration values. We find however a positive and
statistically significant relation when testing our model for the
younger European age-cohorts.

Summing up, [social polarization appears as a key determinant of
populist attitudes among Europeans]{.underline}, but there is also an
anti-immigration effect. These results may appear to contradict the view
that economic factors only account for a limited portion in individuals'
populist attitudes and votes (Margalit 2019).22 We think that this is
not the case in our study. [[Social polarization]{.mark} must not be
considered as an economic variable per se, but [also as a measure of
potential tensions and conflicts within the society]{.mark}. As such,
[it drives populist attitudes and values like distrust of
institutions]{.mark}, distrust of others, anti-immigration, and
authoritarianism.]{.underline}

SSQ: Your book Conventional Deterrence was published in 1984. What is
your definition of conventional deterrence?

JJM: [[Conventional deterrence]{.mark} is all [about persuading]{.mark}
an [adversary not to initiate]{.mark} a [war]{.mark}
because]{.underline} the expected [costs]{.underline} and risks
[outweigh]{.underline} the anticipated [benefits]{.underline}. When I
wrote Conventional Deterrence, I was specifically interested in
examining situations where two large armies face each other and at least
one of them is thinking about attacking the other.

Throughout the first three decades of the Cold War, virtually all the
literature on deterrence dealt with nuclear deterrence. Hardly any
attention was paid to conventional deterrence. Indeed, I think I am the
first person to ever write an article or book dealing explicitly with
conventional deterrence. My goal, of course, was to think systematically
about how deterrence works when there is a possibility of a major
conventional war, but nuclear weapons are not part of the equation.

SSQ: Early in the book you discuss how conventional deterrence is
obtained and state, \"[Conventional [deterrence is largely]{.mark} a
function of [military strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}\" (p. 63). Later on
you write, \"Military calculations will not always deter
decision-makers\" (p. 209). Can you explain this difference?

JJM: As Clausewitz makes clear, war is an extension of politics by other
means. In other words, [states]{.underline} invariably [go to war in
pursuit of specific political goals]{.underline}. The intensity of the
political forces pushing a state to countenance war varies from case to
case, but sometimes they are especially powerful.
[[States]{.underline}]{.mark} also pay careful attention to purely
military considerations. They [want to know what is going to happen when
the fighting starts and]{.underline} what they are likely to achieve at
the end of the conflict. They also [[want to know how much risk is
involved]{.underline}]{.mark} in pursuing their chosen military
strategy. Sometimes [states]{.underline} will [assess]{.underline} that
[the likelihood of military success]{.underline} is very low, but still
go to war, because political calculations dictate that it is worth
taking the risk. The two classic cases of this kind of logic at work are
the Japanese attack against the United States in December 1941 and the
Egyptian attack against Israel in October 1973.

SSQ: On p. 16 you state, \"Since WWII, [the [nature of conventional war
has not changed and]{.mark} there is [no reason to expect a
change]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" Does the idea of war being characterized
by clashing mass armies remain true?

JJM: The only reason to rule out the possibility of clashing mass armies
is the presence of nuclear weapons. [[While]{.underline}]{.mark} there
is no question that [[nuc]{.mark}lear [weapons reduce]{.mark} the
[possibility of]{.mark}]{.underline} a large-scale [[conventional
war]{.underline}]{.mark} between two nuclear-armed states, [[there
is]{.mark} still [a real possibility]{.mark} that [such a war might
happen]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [possibility]{.underline} was a matter
of great concern on the central front [[in Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}
during the Cold War, and it is a concern today on the [[Korea]{.mark}n
peninsula [and]{.mark}]{.underline} on the border between [[India and
Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}.

SSQ: How does military reluctance to engage in conflict affect political
decisions concerning conventional deterrence?

JJM: There are [some cases where]{.underline} political [leaders want to
go to war, but]{.underline} their country\'s [military leaders
resist]{.underline}, mainly because they are not confident they can
achieve their goals on the battlefield. [In those cases, deterrence is
likely to hold]{.underline}. This logic explains why the German generals
initially prevented Hitler from attacking France soon after Poland fell
in September 1939.

SSQ: A quote from p. 211 says, \"Although a limited aims strategy is
hardly ever an attractive option, it is usually not so unattractive that
deterrence obtains in a crisis.\" Are nations doomed to continue with
limited aims strategies?

JJM: [Limited aims]{.underline} strategies [are not
attractive]{.underline}, because [[limited wars]{.underline}]{.mark}
tend to [[escalate]{.mark} in the modern world. Limited wars usually
turn [into unlimited wars]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nevertheless, there are
sometimes circumstances where the political imperative for war is so
powerful that states will pursue a limited aims strategy anyway. This
logic explains why the Egyptians pursued a limited aims strategy when
they attacked Israel in October 1973.

SSQ: Have determinants of the success of conventional deterrence
changed?

JJM: I think the basic determinants remain unchanged. One could argue,
however, that conventional deterrence between China and the United
States largely involves air and naval forces, whereas conventional
deterrence during the Cold War was more about the clashing of large
armies supported by tactical air power. My book, of course, focused
mainly on the latter scenario, and thus one could say we need to think
more about the former scenario.

SSQ: Is your definition of deterrence the same for nuclear and
conventional, and how is conventional deterrence complicated by nuclear
weapons?

JJM: The definition for conventional and nuclear deterrence is the same
if you are talking about the overarching relationship between military
and political calculations and how they interact to affect deterrence.
But the military calculations are different in those two realms. For
example, it is difficult to see how a military can employ nuclear
weapons on the battlefield to achieve meaningful success. That is
certainly not the case, however, with conventional weapons. Furthermore,
inflicting \--or threatening to inflict\--immediate and massive
punishment on the other side\'s civilian population is of central
importance in the world of nuclear deterrence. It is not an important
consideration in the conventional realm, which is not to deny that
civilians sometime end up suffering greatly in conventional wars. But it
rarely happens immediately and it is not the equivalent of [[being
vaporized]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[is a serious possibility
in]{.mark} a [nucl]{.mark}ear [war]{.mark}.]{.underline}

SSQ: Is it possible today to achieve strategic surprise?

JJM: I think it is more difficult to achieve strategic surprise today
than it was when I wrote about conventional deterrence in the 1980s. The
main reason is that the ability of countries to penetrate each other\'s
various communications networks has markedly improved in recent decades.
Still, one does not want to underestimate how clever states bent on
achieving surprise can be, or how obtuse potential victims can be
sometimes.

SSQ: Is the concept of conventional deterrence still relevant given
terrorist adversaries, and how does regime type relate to conventional
deterrence?

JJM: [Terrorism]{.underline} is a minor factor in international
politics, and it [has little to do with conventional deterrence. Regime
type has hardly any effect on conventional deterrence]{.underline}. The
underlying logic applies equally to democracies and authoritarian
states.

SSQ: How have technological improvements such as precision-guided
munitions (PGM), stealth, and missile defense affected conventional
deterrence?

JJM: PGMs and missile defense were around when I first started writing
about conventional deterrence. Indeed, the first article I ever
published was on PGMs and how they affect conventional war. [When it
comes to weaponry, militaries operate in a very dynamic
environment]{.underline}, and the particular constellation of weapons
that states have at their disposal at any particular point in time
affects the military calculations that underpin deterrence in important
ways. [[What is crucial]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[is how
militaries employ]{.mark} the]{.underline} different [[weapons]{.mark}
in their arsenals. [Doctrine and strategy matter greatly for]{.mark}
both [deterrence and war fighting]{.mark}]{.underline}. This has always
been the case and always will be.

SSQ: How do you see autonomous weapons systems and artificial
intelligence affecting conventional deterrence? Positive or negative?

JJM: While I recognize that [autonomous weapons and artificial
intelligence]{.underline} add a new twist to warfare[, I do not see them
making]{.underline} conventional [deterrence more or less likely to
work.]{.underline}

SSQ: Can we apply the concept of conventional deterrence to conflicts in
space and cyber?

JJM: Given that it is possible to have a conventional war in space, one
could surely apply basic deterrence theory to that realm, although I
have never thought much about how one would do that. It is also possible
to imagine two sides waging a nonnuclear war that only involved
cyberattacks. One could also apply the logic of conventional deterrence
to that realm, although again, I have not studied that issue. One can
also imagine both space and cyber being bound up with more traditional
military forces in a potential conflict situation. It seems likely, for
example, that [two large armies facing off against each other in a
crisis will be]{.underline} heavily [dependent on communications
networks that are vulnerable to cyberattacks]{.underline}. Does this
create a situation where the side that strikes first wins because it
effectively paralyzes the other side\'s armies, thus weakening
conventional deterrence? Or does it create a situation where it does not
matter who strikes first, because the victim will retain the capability
to wreck the attacker\'s command and control? Thus, there is no
difference between first strike and second strike, which strengthens
deterrence. I do not know the answers to these questions, but there is
no doubt we need good answers, because questions of this sort are of
central importance for understanding conventional deterrence in the
contemporary world.

¶ The [infrastructure for]{.underline} human [civilization
is]{.underline} undeniably tangible (that is, physical, chemical, and
biological), but it is [increasingly virtua]{.underline}l as well, and
the [virtual aspects of]{.underline} that [infra]{.underline}structure
-- the [information ecosystem]{.underline} (or, equivalently,
environment) -- in many ways [has become central and often critical to
the way people]{.underline} now [live]{.underline} all over the world.
As Balkin (2012) describes, "[it is not an exaggeration to say that
modern states are informational states]{.underline}: [states that
recognize and solve problems of governance by collecting, analyzing, and
distributing information]{.underline}." Consider that [nations require
good information to allo- cate benefits and social services to the
populace]{.underline}; [to administer mechanisms for public
safety]{.underline} (e.g. law enfor- cement, court systems,
fire-fighting); [to provide for national security]{.underline}; to
[gather revenue to support national expenditures]{.underline}; [and to
engage with other nations in ways that support national
interests.]{.underline} [Businesses]{.underline} and nonprofit entities
in turn [are]{.underline} also [highly dependent on
information]{.underline}. They [use]{.underline} it [to develop products
and services]{.underline} for customers and cli- ents; to [understand
markets and audiences]{.underline} for their products and services; [to
inform]{.underline} customers and clients about their products and
services; to [comply with laws and
reg]{.underline}ulation[s]{.underline} applicable to their products and
ser- vices; [and to maintain]{.underline} their accounting and
[finances.]{.underline} Construction and [manufacturing projects
entail]{.underline} the [coordination of]{.underline} dozens, hundreds,
or [thousands of par- ties]{.underline} -- [all]{.underline} of whom
[must have]{.underline} a [justifiable confidence in the information
they are sharing]{.underline} and relying upon. ¶ Contextualized,
reliable, trustworthy [info]{.underline}rmation is as
[important]{.underline} to the thinking of human beings [as clean
air]{.underline} is to human breathing. Human beings depend on good
information for making informed decisions about politi- cal candidates
standing in elections; to know as consu- mers which specific products
and services will best serve their needs; for managing their finances;
in making health-related decisions about themselves and their loved
ones; in learning to perform their jobs more effec- tively or
efficiently; and in truly countless other ways. ¶ [Nations]{.underline}
also [engage extensively in information pro- duction.]{.underline} They
provide education for young people; sup- port scientific research that
[undergirds economic growth]{.underline} and prosperity; and collect,
curate, and disseminate large- scale statistical data that influence
decisions at every level of society. Imagine what life would be like
[if]{.underline} citizens [could not count on]{.underline} the validity
and trustworthiness of the [informa- tion]{.underline} underlying any of
these activities. In some cases, the result would be no more than minor
annoyance. In others, however, the result could be life-threatening.
[Nations]{.underline} could be \[[devastated]{.underline}\], as they
could and likely would [make bad]{.underline} or at least sub-optimal
[decisions about war and peace]{.underline}, the [economy,]{.underline}

Nuclear conflict

[On the risks of nuclear conflict]{.underline}, [theories and approaches
to nuclear deterrence]{.underline} and strategic stability developed
prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union in the late 1980's and early
1990's [rest on the presumption of rationality in national decision
makers]{.underline}. In particular, they assume that adversaries are
deterred from attacking by a threat of retaliation that would impose
costs on the adversary that would outweigh any conceivable benefits that
it would gain from an attack (Morgan 2003). [Central to this assumption
is a rational adversary that can and does make a calculation of expected
costs and benefits, com- pares them, and then acts
accordingly.]{.underline}

But the psychologically informed understanding of real- world decision
making described above was not accepted widely in the scientific
literature until approximately the same time as the collapse of the
Soviet Union, and the seminal work in such understanding occurred only
in the decade previous to that. What [a psychologically-informed
understanding of real-world decision making tells us]{.underline} is
[that]{.underline} the [rationality assumption at the base of much
traditional thinking on deterrence and strategic stability is
untenable]{.underline}, [given that humans have evolved to rely on
intuitive, reflex- ive, heuristic System 1 thinking to make
decisions]{.underline}, [particu- larly when faced with time pressures,
surprise and other obstacles to the deliberate calculation]{.underline}
implied by System 2 thinking (Kahneman 2011). [Psychology tells us
that]{.underline} -- more often than not -- [the fast, intuitive
judgements of System 1 often take precedence over the slower, more
analytical thinking of System 2.]{.underline}

The [challenges posed by reflexive reliance on System 1
thinking]{.underline} are [greatly accentuated by]{.underline}
characteristics of today's [information environment.]{.underline}
[Social media networks in particular are optimally designed to stimulate
System 1 thinking]{.underline} -- emotional, reflexive, immediate --
[and]{.underline} they [rapidly transmit content among like-minded
individuals]{.underline}, [creating the ideal conditions for public
polarization and divisiveness to occur (]{.underline}Pfeffer, Zorbach,
and Carley 2014). Multiple [narratives rapidly emerge around complex
events]{.underline}; [citizens splinter into their own informational
universes and are unable to agree on an underlying reality]{.underline}.
[Political leaders themselves are subject to these conflicting
narratives and may even be active and influ- ential participants in one
or another of them]{.underline}.

It is thus [easy to posit that in this info]{.underline}rmation [envir-
onment, manipulated information]{.underline} -- either [artificially
constructed]{.underline} or adopted by a strong grassroots base --

Research in the fields of cognitive and social psychol- ogy has
formalized what Hitler knew intuitively. We now understand that human
cognitive processing cap- ability is not unlimited; humans have finite
cognitive resources that can be "used up" under mentally stress- ful
circumstances. Findings from the same cognitive psychology that has
transformed neoclassical econom- ics into behavioral economics (and
resulted in three Nobel Prizes in economics) have made clear the
"bounded rationality" of human thought and the simul- taneous existence
in every individual of the capability to engage in two types of
cognitive processing.

Specifically, heuristic dual-system [cognitive theory
posits]{.underline} that [human beings have two]{.underline} systems for
cogni- tive processing -- an intuitive, reflexive, and [emotionally
driven mode of thought]{.underline} (often [designated as System
1]{.underline}) and [a slower]{.underline}, [more
deliberate]{.underline}, [analytical mode of thought]{.underline} (often
[designated as System 2]{.underline}). Kahneman (2011) provides a primer
on System 1 and System 2 thinking. (See Petty and Cacioppo 1986; Chaiken
1987 for other variants of dual-system cognitive theory; see Kruglanski
and Thompson 1999 for a contrary view on dual-system cognitive theory.)

[System 1 is designed]{.underline} to [operate rapidly]{.underline}, but
it can do so because it does not take account of all available
information [and is]{.underline} thus more [prone to error]{.underline}
(also called bias). System 2 operates more slowly but is more likely to
take into account the available information and is less prone to error.
[People engaging in System 1]{.underline} infor- mation processing
[respond]{.underline} more emotionally and [less rationally or
critically]{.underline} than in System 2 processing.

[Most important]{.underline}, [System 1 thinking is]{.underline} the
[default mode of thought]{.underline} for human beings -- it uses
smaller amounts of cognitive resources, relies on simple gut- based
judgments, and is used more often when humans are under stress. For most
situations encoun- tered in everyday life, System 1 thinking is adequate
and produces mostly valid and useful outcomes, but it often fails [when
a situation requires complex]{.underline} inferences for
[understanding]{.underline}. For such situations, [System 2 think-
ing]{.underline}, which is effortful and consumptive of cognitive
resources, [is]{.underline} more often [appropriate]{.underline} -- and
[when indi- viduals fail to use System 2 when it is appropriate to do
so]{.underline}, t[hey are easily misled.]{.underline}

Most [individuals are capable of both]{.underline} System 1 and System 2
thinking; thus, [the]{.underline} important operative [question is the
circumstances under]{.underline} which [they select]{.underline} one or
the other [type of thinking]{.underline}. [Psychology]{.underline} has
[accumulated considerable evidence relevant to this]{.underline}
question. For example, Taber and Lodge (2006) show that an
[individual]{.underline} tends to be [less critical of
information]{.underline} that is [favorable to \[their\] position than
of info]{.underline}rmation [that is not favorable]{.underline} -- that
is, \[they are\] more likely to engage in System 1 thinking for
favorable information. [People have]{.underline} a [confirmation bias
in]{.underline} their [info]{.underline}rmation [seeking and processing
behavior]{.underline} -- they preferentially seek out information that
is consistent with their beliefs and they are highly critical of (or
ignore) information that contradicts their beliefs. [In a meta-analysis
of 91 studies]{.underline}, Hart et al. (2009) considered [two
motivations for]{.underline} how an [individual might select
info]{.underline}rmation [to consume]{.underline} -- the [desire to
gain]{.underline} an [accurate understanding of reality]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} the [desire to]{.underline} feel
[validate]{.underline}d in [\[their\] beliefs. These two motivations
conflict]{.underline} when an accurate understanding of reality does not
validate one's beliefs, and such a situation motivates the question of
which of these motivations is more powerful. Hart et al. concluded that
both motivations drive human information- seeking behavior, thus
moderating each other to a certain extent, but that [on
balance]{.underline}, [humans]{.underline} do [exhibit a tendency
towards the validation of their beliefs. People]{.underline} are also
[subject to belief perseverance]{.underline} (a.k.a. a continuing
influence effect) -- a cognitive bias through which [individuals do not
revise beliefs based on erro- neous information even when they know for
sure]{.underline} that [such information is erroneous]{.underline}
(Lewandowsky et al. 2012).

Maintenance of an individual's social identity is an important influence
on his or her invocation of System 1 or System 2 thinking. Evidence
suggests that [indivi- duals tend to adopt the views of the peer
groups]{.underline} [that are most salient to them]{.underline}, [even
if]{.underline} the "objective" or ["factual" info]{.underline}rmation
[available]{.underline} to them [contradicts those views]{.underline}.
(Asch 1951 performed the classic "[confor- mity
experiments]{.underline}" that [demonstrated this
phenomenon]{.underline} in the early 1950s.) Uncritical System 1
thinking is active in processing information that is consonant with the
beliefs and attitudes of those peer groups. Critical and skeptical
System 2 thinking is active in processing infor- mation that is
dissonant to those groups' beliefs. These effects (that individuals tend
to accept salient group norms) are even more pronounced in an anonymous
environment, such as that which characterizes much online interaction
(Postmes et al. 2001).

Lastly, there is evidence that [emotion and motivation affect
cognition]{.underline}. For example, [people who are angry tend to rely
more heavily on simple heuristic cues (]{.underline}sug- gestive of
System 1 thinking) [than those who are not angry]{.underline}
(Bodenhausen, Sheppard, and Kramer 1994). [Individuals]{.underline} are
[more likely to stereotype people]{.underline} (a form of System 1
thinking) [when]{.underline} that stereotype is [consistent with their
desired impression of those people]{.underline}; [conver-
sely,]{.underline} [when]{.underline} the stereotype is
[inconsistent]{.underline} with their desired impression, [individuals
tend to inhibit]{.underline} the use of [this stereotype]{.underline}
(Kunda and Sinclair 1999). [Negative emotions]{.underline} (such as
those [induced by]{.underline} the [receipt of info]{.underline}r-
mation [incongruent with]{.underline} a person's [prior
beliefs]{.underline}) can [improve]{.underline} the [ability of a person
to reason logically]{.underline}, thus enabling \[them\] to negate or
discount that informa- tion (Goel and Vartanian 2011).

In the new information environment, exploitation of human cognitive
architecture and capabilities -- which are largely unchanged from what
existed millennia ago -- provides the 21st century information warrior
with cyber- enabled capabilities that Hitler, Stalin, Goebbels, and
McCarthy could have only imagined. [By exploiting cogni- tive
limitations]{.underline}, the [perpetrators of cyber-enabled infor-
mation warfare have learned to exacerbate prejudices, biases, and
ideological differences; to add heat but no light to political
discourse; and to spread widely believed "alternative
facts"]{.underline} in advancing their political positions.

[Russian interference]{.underline} in the 2016 US presidential elec-
tion has dominated news headlines ever since. But interference by
authoritarian countries in the elections of democratic states -- as
undesirable and threatening as it may be -- is [hardly the only negative
consequence]{.underline} of cyber-enabled information warfare. [The
problems of nuclear war and climate change are hard enough to
solve]{.underline} even [when]{.underline} well-intentioned,
[well-informed]{.underline} par- ties on all sides share a basic
understanding and knowl- edge of the relevant facts. [Yes]{.underline},
[they may have different values and]{.underline} different
[priorities]{.underline}, may act under different constraints, and be
able to bring to bear different levels of resources to these problems.

[But without shared]{.underline}, [fact-based understandings
of]{.underline} the [blast, thermal, and radiation effects of nuclear
explosions]{.underline}, [what hope is there for national leaders to
reach agreements to reduce the threat of nuclear holo- caust
or]{.underline} to [make good decisions about nuclear weap- ons use in
times of cris]{.underline}is? [Without shared]{.underline}, fact-based
[understandings that rising atmospheric carbon dioxide]{.underline}
concentrations [caused by human beings result in]{.underline} cor-
responding increases in global temperature and [cli- matic
disruption]{.underline}, [what hope is there]{.underline} for national
leaders to reach agreements [to]{.underline} begin serious efforts at
[decarboniz]{.underline}ing their [econ]{.underline}omies?

#### Degradation of the information ecosystem [locks in climate denialism]{.underline}. Cyber-enabled tactics [exploit cognitive biases]{.underline}.

Climate change denialism

[Climate change denialism can be fairly characterized as cyber-enabled
information warfare]{.underline} [against the reality of large-scale
anthropogenically-induced climate change]{.underline}. In the responses
of people resistant to taking action to miti- gate climate change, we
see a [number of psychological factors at work]{.underline} (Zaval and
Cornwell 2016). For example, one key element of System 1 thinking is the
availability heuristic, with which [individuals tend to associate the
like- lihood of an event with the ease with which they can remember
similar events in the past]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} the
[long-term consequences of climate change are unprecedented
in]{.underline} recorded human [history and obviously]{.underline}
[people have no personal memories of unprecedented events]{.underline}.

Moreover, [climate change is]{.underline} a [long-term process whose
inexorable progression is easily masked by short-term fluc- tuations in
local]{.underline} weather [conditions.]{.underline} For example,
[public concerns about]{.underline} [climate]{.underline} changes
[correlate with local weather conditions]{.underline} (Krosnick et al.
2006). Climate change [deniers]{.underline} are also [quick to flag
for]{.underline} public [attention days that are particularly cold as
"evidence"]{.underline} that [global warming is not
occurring]{.underline} and thus, they claim, discrediting theories of
climate change. This [illustrates]{.underline} a [bias known as
attribute]{.underline}

substitution, as Kahneman and Frederick (2002) describe, through which
[individuals substitute salient information]{.underline} (such as the
cold temperature today) [for information that]{.underline} is more
relevant but [harder to understand]{.underline} ([such as]{.underline}
infor- mation about global [climate change]{.underline}).

People are also subject to a [loss-aversion bias]{.underline}, in which
they [place greater weight on losses than gains]{.underline} of equal
value. In 1992, the United States committed itself to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change, although President George HW
Bush also stated that "the American way of life is not up for
negotiation" -- and in 2018, the United States withdrew from the Paris
Agreement (which was based on the convention). The argument? That the
United States would have to give up too much if it kept to the
agreement.

To close this (merely illustrative) exploration of biases relevant to
climate change denialism, the [optimism bias suggests that people
consider themselves exceptions when considering the likelihood of a
negative event occurring]{.underline}. That is, bad things may happen to
other peo- ple, but they won't happen to me, even though I and those
other people are similar in important and relevant ways. In a climate
context, [the bad things may involve sea level rise or heat
waves]{.underline} -- [and the misperception that "others may suffer
from such problems but I won't" diminishes the power of personal concern
as a driver for rational decision making.]{.underline}

[Connecting the operation of these cognitive biases to the affordances
of modern information technologies is not difficult.]{.underline} For
example, Roxburgh et al. (2019) demonstrate how the characteristics of
specific weather events (e.g. hurricanes or snowstorms) and "short-term
socio-political context can play a critical role in deter- mining the
lenses through which climate change is viewed." Note especially the
importance of "short-term socio-political context" -- precisely the
context that social media shapes.

Elsasser and Dunlap (2013) noted the [influential role]{.underline} of a
variety [of newspaper columnists in]{.underline} [advancing denialist
arguments and]{.underline} thus [amplifying]{.underline} these [argu-
ments to]{.underline} a [broad segment of the]{.underline} American
[public]{.underline}. Fewer in number then, [essentially all
columnists]{.underline} today (of all political leanings) [have a social
media presence]{.underline} that they use [to publicize their
work]{.underline}, and in [many instances]{.underline} their online
[presence]{.underline} is [driven]{.underline} in significant part [by
social media and reach]{.underline} many more readers online than in
print. Furthermore, [subtleties and nuan- ces]{.underline} in their
extended written pieces are [likely to be lost]{.underline} when they
are represented [in social media]{.underline}.

[Another important element]{.underline} of [climate]{.underline} change
[denial- ism is the easy accessibility of seemingly-authoritative
information that casts doubt on]{.underline} the [well-established
science of climate change]{.underline}. As reported by The Guardian, a
[variety of largely secret funding sources distributed \$118 million to
102 denialist organizations]{.underline} (Goldenberg 2013). Oreskes and
Conway (2011) provide [the definitive work on deliberate
info]{.underline}rmation [campaigns]{.underline} to
[obscure]{.underline} the scientific [truth on a range of
issues]{.underline} from smoking to climate change. These [denialist
organizations]{.underline} have [gen- erated a variety of]{.underline}
[products for]{.underline} public and policy [con- sumption]{.underline}
([but]{.underline} -- unsurprisingly -- [not many]{.underline}
peer-reviewed scientific [articles]{.underline}) that are [easily
accessible to the public]{.underline}, [mainstream media]{.underline}
outlets, [and policy makers]{.underline}. [Their pro- ducts are broadly
disseminated through social media and easily found through customized
search, and]{.underline} they are [sought by reporters who seeking to
cover "both sides" of a controversy that is intellectually equivalent to
a "controversy" about whether the earth is round or flat]{.underline}

Fearing the end of the enlightenment

The [Enlightenment established reason and reality as]{.underline} the
[foundational pillars of]{.underline} civilized [discourse.]{.underline}
In [such discourse]{.underline}, [logic matters]{.underline}, and a
logical contradiction between state- ment A and statement B means that
at least one of those statements is false. The [truth]{.underline} of a
statement [about the world is]{.underline} [tested by]{.underline} its
[correspondence to]{.underline} objective [reality rather than by how
many people believe it]{.underline}; that is, [empiri- c]{.underline}al
data are [influential.]{.underline} Furthermore, [statements known to be
wrong or false do not affect conclusions]{.underline} or choices
[between alternative courses of action.]{.underline}

[Cyber-enabled info]{.underline}rmation [war]{.underline}fare [provides
the tactics, tools, and procedures]{.underline} -- in short, the means
-- [to replace the pillars of logic, truth, and reality with fantasy,
rage, and fear. In]{.underline} a [world of ubiquitous cyber-enabled
info]{.underline}rmation [war-]{.underline} fare, [communication and
info]{.underline}rmation [inflame passions rather than informing
reason]{.underline}, [play to the worst]{.underline} in [people's
cognitive]{.underline} [architectures rather than the best]{.underline},
[and divide rather than unify]{.underline}. [Deliberate corruption
of]{.underline} the [information ecosystem]{.underline} could be seen as
an [analog of poisoning water supplies that can be done remotely,
inexpensively, and anonymously]{.underline}. All of this is just another
way of saying that [today it is possible to see glimmerings of an anti-
Enlightenment that can possibly take root and that would indeed be the
end of civilization]{.underline} as we know it.

[Adversaries foreign and domestic that]{.underline} make [use
cyber-enabled info]{.underline}rmation [warfare turn our internal
cognitive processes and our external institutional and legal processes
against us.]{.underline} Under the cover of "fair play" rubrics and the
First Amendment, [they have turned us against ourselves.]{.underline}
[Desperately needed are ways of countering the insidious tactics of
cyber-enabled infor- mation warfare for ourselves]{.underline}.

How might we proceed? [We need]{.underline} action [to
develop]{.underline} better [ways of identifying adversary]{.underline}
cyber-enabled infor- mation warfare [campaigns in progress]{.underline};
[good counter- measures to help human beings resist]{.underline} the use
of cyber- enabled information warfare
[op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline} [targeted against
them]{.underline}; [and good measures to degrade, disrupt, or expose the
adversary's use of cyber-enabled information warfare
operations]{.underline}. All of this is easier said than done, however,
as [cyber-enabled capabilities for info]{.underline}rmation [warfare
increase while human]{.underline} cognitive [limitations remain the
same]{.underline}. [Our work is cut out for us. If we fail]{.underline},
[the world is at increasing risk of large-scale and long-term societal
frac- ture, the end of the Enlightenment, and the start of an
informational Dark Age.]{.underline}

COVID-19 is the first global crisis that affects virtually every person
on the planet at the same time. The pandemic has been a stress test for
the relationship between science and diplomacy,2 triggering a reckoning
of how [**transnational crises of planetary scale**---infectious
diseases, the looming climate crisis, biodiversity collapse---interlink
humanity's destiny]{.underline}. [**Despite** **the predictability** of
an existential threat of this nature, most **countries were
insufficiently prepared**]{.underline}. [Their responses exposed a
**profound disconnect** between the **scientific and foreign policy**
domains and underscore the urgency of **bringing science** from the
margins to the **center of global policy.**]{.underline}

While international research collaboration on SARS-CoV-2 thrived and
achieved unprecedented breakthroughs at record speed, [many **world
leaders ignored** **scientific** recommendations and retreated from
multilateral coordination, resulting in **fragmented measures** that
often **contradicted** those of **neighboring nations**]{.underline}.
These governmental [**responses manifested the inadequacy** of current
international science-policy interface structures **to address** the
**challenges** facing humanity and the planet.]{.underline} With
effective vaccines now available, the end of the pandemic is in sight,
[but **vaccine diplomacy** is being revealed as a battle **for
international leadership and geopolitical influence**,**4 rather than**
the global **cooperation and solidari**ty this moment calls
for.]{.underline}

A crucial task before us, as we enter the next phase of the pandemic, is
to capture the lessons from this extraordinary chapter in history to
prevent crises of such magnitude in the future, and to rebuild adaptive
and resilient systems that prevent the next health and environmental
disasters. This special issue of Science & Diplomacy examines the
science diplomacy dimensions of the pandemic from different regions,
stakeholders, and sectors, as they relate to preparedness, management,
and recovery. Articles exploring approaches in the Americas, Europe,
South Asia, the Arab region, and Africa all coincide on the need to
build, restore, or strengthen national, regional, and global
science-policy structures. For example, Dalal Najib describes the
immense challenges facing Arab countries in the post-COVID recovery and
the need for a regional advisory body to better coordinate policy
actions.5 Phyllis Kalele and Stanley Maphosa take stock of the COVID-19
response on the African continent, noting that only half of the 54
countries in Africa have national academies of science, and many of
those lack the resources and recognition to adequately advise their
governments.6

Many were surprised to watch countries with some of the most robust
systems and structures of government science advice struggle to contain
the virus. Lemay et al. argue that one of the reasons may be the
disconnect between domestic and foreign science policy. As governments
went into crisis mode, science attaché networks were underutilized.7
Science attachés were forced to pivot away from their regular duties to
support repatriation efforts of stranded country nationals or advise
colleagues on the import and export of COVID-19 medical technologies.
[The **logistical disruptions** and reorientation of work **interfered
with communication among science attach**és from different countries in
the same region, **a missed opportunity for** better **regional
coordination** and **optimization** of resources.]{.underline}

Three pieces focus on the role of higher education institutions as
engines of global collaboration for pandemic response and recovery.
Alice Gast calls for universities to augment their nations' foreign
policy with a synergistic apolitical approach of their own, given their
ability to transcend political barriers through academic collaborations
that promote transboundary cooperation.8 Lyons et al. suggest creating
new science diplomacy mechanisms to fill what they call the "orphan
space" at the intersection of academia, government, science, and
international engagement.9 Lee et al. show how it is in every
high-income country's national interest to invest in research and
capacity development in low- and middle-income countries.10 Similarly,
tackling global problems at the local level is how Schneider et al.
propose to address the so-called "infodemic" of misinformation that has
eroded trust in science and could jeopardize the rollout of the
vaccines. By engaging with local communities, and not just disseminating
information from centralized institutions, scientists can regain
society's trust.11

Authors note that in most countries, the scientific and diplomatic
communities are largely siloed educationally and professionally, with
different cultures, values, skill sets, and career paths.12 Here
universities can play a key role by formally introducing science
diplomacy in STEM and international relations curricula to build the
necessary bridges between the two communities.13 A growing number of
governments and diplomatic academies are also embedding scientific and
technological expertise in the foreign service,14 but academic, legal,
administrative, and cultural barriers still impede bidirectional
engagement between the scientific and diplomatic spheres in many
countries. Governments must foster the demand for science diplomacy by
establishing mechanisms such as fellowship programs, pairing schemes,
and secondments to immerse scientific experts in foreign ministries and
multilateral bodies.

The piece by Sholts et al. on the history and future of the Smithsonian
Institution highlights the often neglected colonialist and imperialist
roots of historical scientific cooperation episodes driven by the Global
North now being reframed as examples of science diplomacy.15 Robert Swap
adds that effective science diplomacy is based not only on sharing
knowledge, but cultivating cross-cultural and interpersonal skills that
build trust over time and address the legacies and currently lived
realities of racial, social, and environmental injustice in order to
foster more equal international partnerships.16

One baseline challenge noted in several pieces is the unfamiliarity of
many stakeholders with science diplomacy as a concept and as a tool. As
there is neither a commonly agreed-upon definition nor a consensus on
its objectives, actors, instruments, and activities, the term is neither
universally embraced nor consistently used.17 Kerri-Ann Jones offers an
explanation: science diplomacy is still evolving out of two very
well-established fields and is struggling to establish its distinct
identity.18 Furthermore, the narrative has come under intense academic
scrutiny19 in recent years as a focus on its cooperative logic has led
to the neglect of its competitive dimensions, which are increasingly
important given that commercially-oriented scientific and technological
breakthroughs can give particular nation-states an economic edge over
others.

Indeed, rapid advancements in frontier research and innovation can help
unify nations toward collective actions to achieve the United Nations'
2030 agenda, but the convergence of some of these
technologies\--artificial intelligence, quantum computing, synthetic
biology, gene editing or climate-altering technologies\--with political
and societal issues can generate enormous risks and challenges for
democracy and multilateral governance. As these technologies become
strategic sovereign assets and critical infrastructure for national
security, they can also amplify social inequalities, perpetuate racial
and gender biases, and deepen geopolitical divides.20 To remain relevant
and fulfill its potential to address global challenges, the
institutional architecture of science diplomacy will need to adapt to
the scale and speed of the transformations ahead with a whole-of-society
approach. Beyond the policy and academic communities, other actors
including technological and pharmaceutical companies, international
scientific societies, and philanthropic individuals and organizations,21
have played a pivotal role in addressing COVID-19 and will have an
influential role in strengthening science diplomacy efforts moving
forward.

While COVID-19 discoveries have been the top priority of the global
scientific community, let us not forget how issues pertaining to
biodiversity loss, climate change, land use, food security, ocean
health, and energy have persisted, as noted by Muhammad Adeel and other
authors.22 2020 tied for warmest year on record.23 A record-breaking
Atlantic hurricane season and the fires ravaging Australia, California,
and the Amazon were a reminder of the inextricable links between human
and planetary health. As Lemery et al. put it, "the pandemic has served
as a palpable admonishment of our custodianship of the commons."24

We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to change the trajectory of
the interrelated global crises upon us. Several articles in this special
issue touch upon the Overton window, a name for the idea that policy
proposals that are unthinkable and intractable in one moment (such as
universal basic income, emergency policies to house the homeless, and
the provision of free internet to support remote learning) can swiftly
become not only acceptable, but even inevitable.25 The historic
mobilization of resources, public policy measures, and behavioral change
during the pandemic can pave the way for more sustained engagement
between the scientific and policy spheres for bigger crises, such as
climate change. Preventing and responding to the next global crisis will
require building creative coalitions among a broader range of actors and
placing science, health, climate, and the environment at the heart of
the multilateral system. Building (or repairing) the bridges between
science and diplomacy will allow us to reframe our relationship with
each other and with the planet, as the impact of transboundary threats
to health and environment anywhere are felt everywhere. This point is
exemplified by the recent legal ruling in France that overturned a
deportation order against a man from Bangladesh with severe asthma, as
the dangerous air pollution in his country of origin is a threat to his
life should he return.26

Perhaps the most salient lesson from the analyses, reflections, and

Messages such as drink corona beer to get the corona virus, or to
prevent it, were sometimes sent for fun. Disinformation in the form of
conspiracy theories appear to be sent to recruit new believers, and to
reinforce or extend the conspiracy story. Other disinformation appears
orchestrated and is part of larger influence campaigns. In some of these
cases there are likely to be behind the scene marketers making money by
spreading disinformation as has happened in various elections around the
world. False images about the size of the re-open protests,
disinformation about anti-reopen public proponents, stories about empty
hospitals and the like are types of disinfor- mation used to promote
social behaviors such as protests, voting, and belief in public
institutions. [Disinformation about the CDC, WHO, and various medical
authorities]{.underline} was used to [reduce trust in]{.underline} these
public [institutions.]{.underline} [Disinformation linking different
vaccines, social distancing, and facemasks was used]{.underline} to
[build bridges between diverse groups]{.underline} in attempts [to
create or strengthen]{.underline} particular [movements and political
agendas]{.underline}. Such disinformation [supported the anti-science
movement and a far-right political agenda]{.underline}. [Disinformation
regarding the actions of governments]{.underline}, police, or leaders
such as [false descriptions of]{.underline} lock down [procedures
or]{.underline} their [role in promoting a vaccine]{.underline} was
[used to discredit and so decrease trust in these actors or to bring
them undue]{.underline} credit. Some disinformation was aimed at
specific minority groups---sometimes to harm and sometimes to keep their
voice out of the public debate.

Although this is a small exploration, it does show a connection among
conspiracy theories. It also shows an [interesting link to
China]{.underline}. In a further examination, we also found that the
[anti-vax community had more members who followed]{.underline} the
[state spon- sored media accounts from China and]{.underline}/or
[Russia]{.underline}. In other words, [the anti-vax groups]{.underline}
are [getting fodder for]{.underline} their [conspiracies]{.underline} in
part [from the disinformation coming from foreign states]{.underline}.
We also found that there were [more bots]{.underline}
[among]{.underline} the [anti-vaccination community than]{.underline}

the [bots on the anti]{.underline}- vaccination [side]{.underline} often
[promoted stories about Bill Gates inventing the virus or 5G towers used

Prior [studies]{.underline} have [show]{.underline}n that [Russian

divide into a partisan divide]{.underline} (Walter et al., 2020). They
were [also instru- mental in amplifying the debate]{.underline}
(Broniatowski et al., 2018). [Our results add to this]{.underline} by
showing that [the divide]{.underline} is not just due to trolls; but
that bots, and regular users are also [transforming the nature of the
vaccine debate through]{.underline} the use of
[disinfo]{.underline}rmation. Indeed we find that regular members of the
anti-vax group brought in disinformation to the community to foster
conspiracies about the effect of vaccinations and the need for them.
[Conspiracy stories]{.underline} were [used to bind individuals into

bring down a city\'s power grid", Aug 2020//SK

[Social media]{.underline} has dramatically altered the ways in which
conflicts are fought. By allowing belligerents to command the public
narrative, these technologies [have created a paradigm wherein the most
viral information can influence the outcome of wars]{.underline} \[1\].
This phenomenon has been exacerbated by social media algorithms that
value virality over veracity \[2,3\]. Unsurprisingly, many notable
skirmishes in recent years have used disinformation to manipulate
peoples\' behavior \[1,4\]. Such [campaigns have become particularly
effective due to the ever-increasing prevalence of big data and machine
learning techniques that allow the behavioral patterns of the masses to
be analyzed with unprecedented precision]{.underline}. Among the
clearest manifestations of such campaigns are the alleged Russian
interference into the 2016 US presidential election and the Brexit
referendum \[5,6\]. These incidents suggest that the [microtargeting
capabilities provided by companies such as Cambridge Analytica \[7\] can
be weaponized \[8\] to influence the long-term decisions of a
society.]{.underline} While many studies have analyzed campaigns
targeting long-term social behavior manipulation \[2,9-12\], little
attention has been given to targeted attacks that use disinformation as
a weapon to manipulate social behavior within a limited time span.

[One particularly sensitive target that is vulnerable to behavioral
manipulation is critical infrastructure, the attack of which may have
drastic implications nationwide]{.underline}. For instance, despite high
levels of security, human operators proved to be the weakest link during
the [Stuxnet attack on the Iranian nuclear program]{.underline},
unwittingly introducing malware into the facilities \[13,14\]. Another
attack of this kind that drew concern from governments worldwide was the
[Ukrainian power grid cyberattack of 2015]{.underline} \[15,16\]. [In
this incident, attackers deliberately cut off the power supply for
230,000 residents for several hours using operator credentials harvested
through one particular form of disinformation, namely,
spear-phishing]{.underline} \[17\].

In this study, we focus on the power grid-a choice motivated by the
devastation caused by historical power outages [including human
casualties and massive financial losses]{.underline} \[18-20\]. Yet,
while numerous blackout prevention and mitigation strategies have been
proposed in the literature \[21-32\], the link between disinformation
and blackouts has never been studied to date. Driven by this
observation, we seek to answer the following question: [can an adversary
bring down a city\'s power grid using disinformation without any
physical or cyber intrusions?]{.underline} The main contribution of this
analysis is to assess whether an adversary could attack the power
distribution system not by targeting its hardware or software
infrastructure, but by focusing entirely on [manipulating individual
consumers\' behavior]{.underline}.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We begin by describing
the mechanism of a disinformation attack on the power grid, and then
evaluate the impact of such an attack considering the distribution
network of the Greater London area as a case study. Subsequently, to
quantify the risk posed by disinformation attacks, we perform analyses
to estimate what disinformation follow-through rates could be achieved
by an adversary in reality. We conclude by highlighting the implications
of our study.

Attack impact on the power grid

We consider an attack in which an adversary attempts to [manipulate the
behavior of citizens by sending fake discount notifications encouraging
them to shift their energy consumption into the peak-demand
period]{.underline}. Such a shift may result in the tripping of
[overloaded power lines, leading to blackouts]{.underline} (see
Methods). An overview of this attack and the disinformation message are
shown in Fig 1. Ultimately, the success of such an attack depends on the
follow-through rate , i.e., the fraction of people who behave as
intended by the attacker. We analyze the impact caused by such
behavioral manipulation on the power grid. To this end, we modeled the
power grid of Greater London (see S1 Note in S1 File) and simulated the
behavior of residential energy consumers. Importantly, our model
considers residential electric vehicle (EV) adoption since the owners of
such EVs control a substantial amount of deferrable energy, and thus can
cause greater harm when manipulated by an adversary. We vary the EV
adoption level in the city, and model the capacity upgrades that are
necessary for the grid to support the demand corresponding to each such
level \[33-35\]; see Methods. Note that although the EV charging demand
is only one component of the total deferrable demand, it nevertheless
accounts for a significant part of the latter. Therefore, in the
following analysis, we use increasing EV adop-tion level as a synecdoche
for the increasing amount of deferrable demand in the grid.

Fig 1. An overview of a disinformation attack on the power system.
Illustrating how the disinformation attack is launched from an attacker,
thereby altering the energy consumption patterns of a portion of the
population. Importantly, not every recipient follows-through on the
notification. \[see PDF for image\]

We consider a scenario where the grid is heavily loaded and any
distribution line can sustain at a maximum a 10% increase in the peak
demand through it (see Methods). Fig 2a presents the percentage of
consumers who experience a blackout given varying follow-through and EV
adoption rates. As can be seen, increasing the EV adoption up to 20%
increases the system vulnerability to the attack, whereas beyond 20% the
system resilience increases, i.e., it requires a greater follow-through
rate to achieve the same attack magnitude. This trend is caused by two
opposing forces: (i) increased vulnerability due to the consumers
controlling more deferrable energy, and (ii) increased resilience due to
the grid\'s upgraded capacity to cope with the increased number of EVs.
When the EV adoption is smaller than or equal to 20%, the former force
outweighs the latter, and hence we see an increase in the system
vulnerability. The opposite is true when the EV adoption exceeds 20%,
leading to the observed increase in resilience. Next, to get a sense of
the distribution of the blackout across the city, we depict the state of
the system corresponding to two different cells in the heat map; see Fig
2b and 2c. As can be observed, [the impact is dispersed throughout the
city rather than being concentrated in very few massive
pockets.]{.underline}

Fig 2. Impact of an attack on the power distribution network of Greater
London. a: The percentage of consumers suffering from a blackout as a
result of the attack given different follow-through rates and EV
adoption rates. The figure also highlights the columns corresponding to
projected EV adoption rates for the UK in the years 2020, 2030, 2040,
and 2050. b: Visualization of the status of every power distribution
line in the system for a follow-through and EV adoption rates of 0.17
and 0.20, respectively. Grey indicates active lines, whereas red
indicates lines that have tripped as a result of overloading. c: The
same as (b), but for follow-through and EV adoption rates of 0.12 and
0.20, respectively. \[see PDF for image\]

We then study how the grid\'s vulnerability depends on the peak
overloading capacity of the distribution lines. Say the overloading
capacity is increased from 10% to 15%. Simulating the system for
follow-through and EV adoption rates of 0.17 and 0.20 respectively, we
find that the attack results in only 5.9% of consumers being offline.
This is in contrast to 35.4% of consumers that were affected by the
blackout when the line capacity was 10% (see Fig 2b). Further increasing
the overloading capacity to 20% reduces the size of the blackout to 1.4%
of the consumers. The heat maps corresponding to these scenarios are
presented in S2 Note in S1 File. To obtain more insight, we analyze the
grid in terms of the line capacity upgrades that are necessary to
support increasing EV adoption. The results shown thus far are for the
case where, for any given EV adoption rate, the grid is assumed to be
upgraded to support exactly that rate. However, if the grid is upgraded
to support more than this rate, the impact of the attack will be
substantially alleviated, and vice versa. Taking the year 2025 as an
example, [if by then the grid was not upgraded since 2020, then a mere
5% follow-through rate can bring the grid down completely.]{.underline}
On the other hand, if the grid in 2025 was upgraded to support the
projected EV adoption until 2030, then even a 100% follow-through rate
would cause a blackout for less than 20% of the residents. These results
highlight the need for future grid upgrades to not only be dictated by
the technical aspects governed by physical laws, but also consider the
behavioral aspects of the consumers who may act unpredictably and
irrationally, especially when subjected to disinformation. However,
since grid upgrades come at a high cost to the power utility \[35\],
perhaps a more realistic solution would be to [focus on increasing the
awareness of the consumers and immunizing them against
disinformation.]{.underline}

Estimating disinformation follow-through

Having assessed how the power grid is affected by the consumers who
follow-through on the fake notification, we now estimate what
follow-through rates could be achieved by an attacker in reality. Here,
the social aspect could play an important role, since people may
unknowingly amplify the attack by forwarding the disinformation
notification to their friends; see Fig 3a for an illustration. (Note
that the term \"friend\" is borrowed from the context of social media to
refer to any \"acquaintance\".) In this context, Goel et al. \[36\]
analyzed a billion diffusion events, and found that (dis)information is
unlikely to become viral through social media, since the vast majority
of the studied events terminated either right after the initial
broadcast itself, or after a single step of propagation through social
media. As such, assuming that the attack considered here has similar
limitations, our analysis considers only a single step of propagation,
whereby the initial recipients of the notification consider forwarding
it to some of their friends.

interests?

Yes. [Info]{.underline}rmation [warfare]{.underline} indeed [has a long
pedigree]{.underline} that reaches into the past for at least the three
millen- nia since the Trojan Horse enabled Greek warriors to breach the
walls around the city of Troy. Much more recently, the rise of the Nazi

Beyond these US, UK, and Finnish examples, [comprehensive approaches to
political warfare among NATO members and partners are less
prominent.]{.underline} Perhaps in part owing to bureaucratic
stovepiping and policymaking preferences, many capitals of [NATO member
states that are targets of these campaigns]{.underline} tend to view
each of Moscow and Beijing's actions discretely rather than as
constituent parts of a holistic strategy. Failure to consider these
activities and their implications holistically---and, therefore,
[failing to address their respective behaviors in a likewise holistic
manner--- risks the United States and its allies taking actions that
achieve short-term successes at the expense of longer-term
gains.]{.underline} Progress on areas like the EU-China Comprehensive
Agreement on Investment (CAI), for example, which seeks to replace
bilateral trade agreements between EU members and China with a common
EU-wide investment framework, can present longer-term strategic risks to
European states, including increased vulnerability to Chinese economic
coercion and influence campaigns---not to mention heightened tensions in
the transatlantic relationship due to increasingly divergent strategic
approaches to China.47 [In other words, a strategic-level approach
between NATO, its member states and partners]{.underline}, the private
sector, and like-minded multilateral organizations like the EU [is
needed, as is a framework to turn strategic consensus into concrete
action.]{.underline} Fortunately, both by treaty and by recent
operational practice, NATO is well positioned to serve as a bedrock for
both. [The Alliance can, therefore, usefully serve as a catalyst for
developing a Comprehensive Approach to combat coercion and political
warfare.]{.underline}

Article 2 and the Art of the Political: NATO's Strategic Role in
Countering Political Warfare

NATO stepping up to take on a larger role in countering political
warfare has its trade-offs, and some might reasonably express concern
about the knock-on effect that such an approach might have on the
conduct of military affairs. Some concerns may include: first, if NATO
is predominantly a military alliance, then it doesn't have a significant
role to play in countering political warfare, which is the realm of
politicians, statesmen, home departments, departments of commerce, and
so on. Second, to assign political warfare as a supporting task to
militaries, and military institutions like NATO, would likely dilute
their focus on their essential defense functions (which are hard enough
to perform on the best of days). It might also lessen the pressure on
NATO allies and partners to effectively share the costs of hard defense.
In the minds of critics, adding political warfare to the growing list of
NATO's tasks means diminishing Alliance effectiveness.

[These arguments---however well-intentioned---are unhelpfully divorced
from both NATO's history and current realities]{.underline}. NATO is,
and [always has been, a political-military alliance]{.underline} in
large part because contemporary alliances are themselves an inherently
political-military construct.48 To argue for the disaggregation of the
military from the economic and political spheres is a conceit, arguably
framed by present bureaucratic realities rather than institutional
history. The post-World War II order, of which NATO is a part, was
designed to be a proactive, forward-looking answer to the security
dilemmas and distrust that had previously characterized alliance
politics.49 "Despair, disorder, decay from within---these were the
likely dangers, not a Soviet invasion."50 As the USSR's aggressive
intentions became more clear[, NATO itself became a solution to enabling
European integration and economic revitalization rather than an end in
and of itself.51]{.underline}

As NATO was established, reconstituting the economic and political
health of its member states was seen as inextricably linked to military
strength; military strength was one important pillar of a comprehensive
strategy to counter Soviet influence and aggression. 52 NATO's purpose,
therefore, as established in the Washington Treaty, is not only to
grapple with military and defense challenges, but also to foster and
protect the values core to its mission and that distinguish NATO as an
alliance of like-minded nations. This is why NATO not only convenes
military leaders and defense ministers at regular defense ministerial
meetings,53 but it also hosts foreign ministers at the same regularity54
and heads of state and government roughly once a year at summits or
Leaders Meetings.55 Protecting the rights of its members as free and
self-determining nations means, in essence, NATO allies have committed
to upholding the integrity of the very institutions that are vulnerable
to political warfare. This is why Article 2 of the Washington Treaty
exists. It reads:

"The Parties will contribute toward the further development of peaceful
and friendly international relations by strengthening their free
institutions, by bringing about a better understanding of the principles
upon which these institutions are founded, and by promoting conditions
of stability and well-being. They will seek to eliminate conflict in
their international economic policies and will encourage economic
collaboration between any or all of them."56

Article 2 of NATO's founding charter is sometimes viewed as the
"Canadian clause" or a throwaway paragraph in the Washington Treaty.57
Yet negotiators of NATO agreements know that they should never discount
a good diplomatic "hook," especially when it might be used to prompt
positive action. Viewed in that light, Article 2 holds enormous utility
in supporting and justifying much-needed NATO action on the political
warfare challenges allies face on a routine basis. NATO has forgotten
how to exercise its political arm to proactively contend with political
and economic coercion as effectively as it does its military arm.
Article 2 is critical to establishing an effective counter-political
warfare response from NATO.

Specifically, in Article 2, allies have pledged to:

■ Shore up free institutions;

■ Establish public understanding of the principles undergirding
institutions;

■ Promote stability and well-being; and

■ Eliminate conflict from international economic policies

and promote economic collaboration.

These Article 2 principles are the very areas at risk from Russian and
Chinese political warfare today. NATO allies and partners have fallen
behind in combatting the political and economic components of political
warfare across the spectrum; as a result, NATO should rethink the
mandate it already has and reinvigorate Article 2 to help empower and
enable a more effective, comprehensive response to future political
warfare campaigns.

This leads to the second concern articulated above, namely, that
expanding the aperture of NATO's activities will inherently dilute the
Alliance and its military capabilities. This logic perhaps makes sense
in the narrower context of burden sharing and defense planning. Yet the
military is not an end in and of itself; rather, the object of the
military is to be one means toward the promotion of national security
and prosperity. Promotion of stability and security---and, therefore,
(if indirectly) prosperity---has been interpreted in a variety of
manners over the course of NATO's history: from deterring Soviet
aggression to responding to crises in the Balkans and the Middle East to
overcoming Franco-German and Greco-Turkish differences. Further,
identifying and countering political warfare is largely an intellectual
endeavor; organized appropriately, the cost of building a NATO
counter-political warfare capability would be miniscule in comparison to
the cost of purchasing defense equipment and acquiring capabilities.
Given that today the stability, security, and prosperity of NATO allies
and partners are being directly challenged by both Russia and China,
this marginal investment would likely yield enormous strategic
dividends.

Economic and political coercion campaigns have important linkages to
national security---linkages that are often difficult for agencies and
institutions to fully appreciate on their own. Trade ministries have a
different set of priorities than defense ministries, but they both work
on matters that have a direct bearing on the security and well-being of
their states. A greater cross-pollination of government efforts improves
assessments of the threat and development of potential solutions.

Taking Stock: Assessing Existing Alliance and Partner Efforts to Counter
Political Warfare

[NATO might usefully seek to build shared understandings of, and
approaches to, countering authoritarian coercion in two key areas:
disinformation and election interference]{.underline}, and coercive
diplomacy and economic subversion.58 What follows is an assessment of
the current state of play and areas ripe for multi-stakeholder
collaboration on these key issues. [Current efforts underway by the
Alliance and its members tend to focus on discrete areas of political
warfare rather than the full gambit. Countering disinformation and cyber
defense are the two most advanced areas of the transatlantic response to
hybrid warfare, yet NATO allies and partners lack advanced strategies to
mitigate coercive diplomacy and predatory economic
practices.]{.underline}

[Disinformation and Election Interference]{.underline}

Alliance-Wide Efforts

[Disinformation is one of the most nefarious challenges NATO faces.
False news and the spread of "alternative" facts and narratives creates
confusion, foments distrust in democratic institutions and government
itself, sharpens societal divisions, and creates negative psychological
and emotional responses that can be used to manipulate people's
viewpoints and beliefs.]{.underline} Across Europe, nations come under
near-daily attack from state-supported and rogue actor disinformation,
from Russian-language campaigns, Chinese propaganda, social media
swarms, and online bots. As Russia and China seek to shape the
information environment in their favor,59 NATO allies have put various
initiatives in place to help combat disinformation and build societal
resilience. Allies have pursued different national initiatives and the
Alliance has worked to share best practices. It is worth noting that
NATO is further advanced in its understanding and response to Russian
disinformation than it is of Chinese disinformation which is much less
analyzed and understood in a transatlantic context.

As tensions mount between Russia and the West over Ukraine, [the threat
of Russian cyberattacks against the U.S. increases]{.underline}. The
Department of Homeland Security issued an intelligence bulletin on Jan.
23, 2022, warning that Russia has the capability to carry out a range of
attacks, from denial-of-service attacks on websites to disrupting
critical infrastructure like power grids.

"We assess that Russia would consider initiating a cyber attack against
the Homeland if it perceived a US or NATO response to a possible Russian
invasion of Ukraine threatened its long-term national security," the DHS
stated in the bulletin, which it sent to law enforcement agencies, state
and local governments, and critical infrastructure operators.

Cybersecurity experts are concerned that in the wake of recent
cyberattacks by hackers affiliated with Russia, the Russian government
has the capability to carry out disruptive and destructive attacks
against targets in the U.S. The SolarWinds attack, uncovered in December
2020, gave the perpetrators access to the computer systems of many U.S.
government agencies and private businesses. The DHS and FBI accused
Russian hackers in March 2018 of infiltrating U.S. energy and
infrastructure networks.

[[Russian]{.mark} cyber[attacks]{.mark} could include continued attempts
to [diminish Americans' confidence in elections]{.mark}]{.underline},
undermine economic stability, damage the energy grid, and even disrupt
health care systems.

While some components of these systems almost certainly remain
vulnerable to Russian-aligned hackers, [the [Russia]{.mark}n government
[is likely to think twice before unleashing]{.mark} highly disruptive
[attacks]{.mark} against the U.S., because the U.S. government could
interpret such attacks]{.underline}, particularly those targeting
critical infrastructure, [as acts of war.]{.underline} The DHS bulletin
stated that [Russia has a high threshold for initiating disruptive
attacks. As a researcher who studies cyberwarfare, I believe [a more
likely threat from Russian hackers is launching disinformation
campaigns.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Distract, distort and divide]{.underline}

Americans can probably expect to see Russian-sponsored cyber activities
working in tandem with propaganda campaigns. These activities are likely
to be aimed at preventing a unified response to Russian aggression in
Ukraine.

Russian military doctrine includes the well-evolved concept of
information confrontation, which uses cyber means to create doubt about
what is true. Russia's information warfare strategy seeks to manipulate
information and relationships.

The specific maneuvers aim to bolster narratives, people and groups that
support Russian interests and undermine those that are counter to
Russian interests. The maneuvers, which include dismissing and
distorting information and undermining opinion leaders, are carried out
in the press and on social media.

Russian intelligence operatives are skilled at using technology,
including amplifying misinformation through fake accounts on popular
social media platforms. In effect, Russia uses social and other online
media like a military-grade fog machine that confuses the U.S.
population and encourages mistrust in the strength and validity of the
U.S. government.

[Repressive governments like those in Russia and China have perfected
the manipulation of online information as a way to control their own
populations. [Democracies are especially vulnerable]{.mark} to these
techniques, [given]{.mark} the open exchange of ideas and [lack of
centralized control over sources of
information]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

In addition, [[U.S. society is polarized]{.mark}, and that polarization
is occurring at an increasing rate. A study by researchers at the
University of Oxford examined [Russia's computational propaganda against
the U.S.]{.mark} between 2013 and 2018 and found that it [was designed
to boost U.S. political polarization.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The coming information dystopia

[Nuclear war and climate change]{.underline} are arguably the [most
important existential challenges today]{.underline} that are co[m-
pounded by the corruption of the information ecosys- tem. But even if a
single miraculous stroke the laws of physics were changed to make
nuclear weapons impos- sible]{.underline} to build and operate
[and]{.underline} to immediately [eliminate anthropogenic
emissions]{.underline} at zero cost, [cyber-enabled information warfare
could still can lead to an informa- tion dystopia]{.underline}. Here are
some possible elements:

- [Adversaries manufacture]{.underline} numerous [graphic videos of
  American soldiers]{.underline} (complete with sound effects)
  [committing battlefield atrocities]{.underline}, [and spread them
  widely through the Internet]{.underline}. Once upon a time, high-
  quality video forgeries were difficult and expensive to make.
  [AI-]{.underline}based technologies [will bring]{.underline} this so-
  called [deepfake capability to the masses,]{.underline} and
  [anyone]{.underline} with imagination, a modicum of technical skill,
  and a personal computer [will be able to distribute rea- sonably
  realistic forgeries]{.underline}. Denials will be issued but of course
  will also not be believed by large fractions of viewers. [Even if
  proof of inauthenticity can be provided]{.underline}, [such evidence
  will not affect the responses of many viewers.]{.underline}

- [Political campaigns]{.underline} conduct similar efforts to [dis-
  credit political opponents]{.underline} (e.g. "showing" an oppo- nent
  making controversial or disqualifying remarks before an election). But
  they also [use]{.underline} the existence of [deepfake
  tech]{.underline}nologies [to deflect attention from authentic and
  real evidence of their own]{.underline} political and personal
  [misdeeds]{.underline}. For example, [a real video of a candidate
  punching an old lady]{.underline} who supports his opponent [will be
  dismissed as]{.underline} "[one of those deepfakes]{.underline} that
  anyone could have produced."

- [Financial markets]{.underline} are [disrupted by falsified videos of
  CEOs making]{.underline} announcements regarding company
  [prospects]{.underline} that are [much more pessimistic than expected.
  Attempts]{.underline} [to correct the record are drowned
  out]{.underline} in a subsequent [flood of contradictory informa-
  tion, all of which appear at first glance to be
  authentic]{.underline}.

- [Public safety is compromised by reports of local
  disasters]{.underline} (e.g. explosions of chemical plants that result
  in the release large amounts of toxic gases). [These reports, along
  with "authentic" video]{.underline} of peo- ple choking amidst locally
  familiar locations (e.g. well-known fields or sport stadiums), [cause
  sponta- neous mass evacuations]{.underline}. [Contradictory
  directions]{.underline} for evacuation broadcast using social media
  [result in chaos]{.underline} on the streets and highways.

- [Public health is placed at risk when the safety and efficacy of
  medical treatments]{.underline} known to be safe and effective [are
  publicly questioned through active disinformation]{.underline}
  [campaigns]{.underline} conducted on the Internet and in bookstores.
  [Attempts to pro- vide valid information are met with responses such
  as]{.underline} "[that's what the]{.underline} pharmaceutical
  companies and [medical establishment want you to think]{.underline},
  but just look at what's happened to our children."

- Children in schools are threatened by online cam- paigns to spread
  rumor, innuendo, and positive or negative information about various
  students. Conducting such campaigns for pay becomes the business model
  of entrepreneurs who advertise that they can guarantee admission to
  selective colleges, boost the social standing of the children of their
  cli- ents, or take revenge on those who have harmed such children, all
  in anonymous and untraceable ways.

- Journalists, political leaders, and judges are com- promised by
  artfully forged emails and alterations to other documents that are
  mixed with entirely authentic leaked emails and documents and are
  indistinguishable from them.

[A world with these elements]{.underline} -- and many more comp- parable
ones -- [will be the inevitable result]{.underline} if and when
deployment and use [of]{.underline} the tools of [cyber-enabled infor-
mation warfare]{.underline} become widespread. And even more trou- bling
is the fact that not every bit of information needs to be corrupted for
this dystopian outcome to occur -- it will require only a fraction of it
to be corrupted for people to lose faith entirely in "objective" and
"trustworthy" sources of information, the result of which will be that
people will fractionate into their own information realities.

Information warfare involves several deceptive and manipulative tactics
employed by adversaries to achieve desired goals (Gill et al., 2019).
This includes the use of disinformation, which refers to a deceptive
technique that is based on the dissemina- tion of untrue information
with the intention to deceive, manipulate, create division and discord,
and sow doubt and fear, versus misinformation in which the disseminator
is unaware that the information is untrue and has no intention to
deceive (Pamment et al., 2018). The goal of disinformation is to divide,
foster confusion, and demotivate people. Disinformation is not new, it
is part of an old playbook of active measures; however what is new is
the development of the internet, more specifically social media
platforms, creating a [new medium to disseminate]{.underline} messages,
[expediting]{.underline} the [ability to propagate
disinformation]{.underline} (Gill et al., 2019). Weaponizing the
internet and social media for disinformation purposes, [adversaries have
an extensive network of internet trolls, bots, and sock puppets to
generate and spread disinformation]{.underline}, [permeating all areas
of the internet most likely to exert influence over people]{.underline}
and their perceptions (Gill et al., 2019). [Dominant disinformation
narratives]{.underline} surrounding COVID-19 [reveals that both Russia
and China have capitalized on the confusion generated by the pandemic to
spread disinformation and shape narratives consistent with their goals
of undermining key Western]{.underline} and European Union [nations
and]{.underline} the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([NATO]{.underline}) (Duncan et al., 2020).

#### Russia and China threaten liberal democracy---US social media exploited for information warfare---US gov key

David L. **Sloss 2022**, He is a professor at Santa Clara University
School of Law, received his JD from Stanford University, MPP from

Similarly, in the modern era of social media, many techno- utopians
mistakenly believe that any government regulation of social media is an
unwarranted infringement of individual liberty. In fact, such regulation
is necessary to protect our body politic from the threat posed by
Russian and Chinese information warfare. Let us be clear: [Liberal
democracy is under attack, not just in the United States but around the
world.]{.underline} As of 2019: "For the first time since 2001, there
are more autocracies than democracies in the world."2 To protect our
cherished liberties, [we need to protect democracies from Chinese and
Russian cyber troops because democratic self- government is the
foundation of individual liberty.]{.underline} The big technology
companies are not up to the task. [We need government regulation so that
Facebook, Twitter, and other social media companies do not continue to
function as Trojan horses, allowing the virus of information warfare to
infect and ultimately subvert liberal democracy]{.underline}. In the
current geopolitical and technological environment, proponents of
liberal democracy and liberal internationalism--- and I openly declare
myself a proponent of both--- confront a difficult choice. Advocates of
liberal democracy are committed to freedom of expression, with minimal
government controls. Advocates of liberal internationalism are committed
to reducing barriers to transnational fl ows of people, goods, and
information. [Russia and China are working "to upend the Western liberal
order by turning Western virtues of openness . . . into vulnerabilities
to be exploited.]{.underline}"3 Unfortunately, their strategy is working
because democratic governments have failed to regulate social media to
protect democracy. If we want to preserve both liberal democracy and
liberal internationalism, [Western democracies must restrict the ability
of Chinese and Russian cyber troops to exploit social media to conduct
information warfare]{.underline}. Until now, democratic governments have
given social media companies carte blanche to decide who is entitled to
create and operate accounts on their platforms. The companies have
adopted open- door policies, allowing almost all people from all
countries to create social media accounts. Consequently, Chinese and
Russian cyber troops have developed an active presence on U.S. social
media platforms. [Russia has taken advantage of U.S. social media
platforms to interfere with democratic elections and to erode faith in
democratic institutions.]{.underline}4 [China has exploited U.S. social
media platforms to disseminate foreign propaganda extolling the virtues
of its authoritarian system and highlighting the flaws of liberal
democracy]{.underline}.5 By granting Chinese and Russian agents
unrestricted access to U.S. social media platforms, democratic
governments are inadvertently making a significant, albeit indirect,
contribution to the worldwide erosion of liberal democratic norms. For
the foreseeable future, [the world will be divided between democratic
and authoritarian states]{.underline}. The United States will continue
to be the most powerful country in the democratic camp. China and Russia
will be the most powerful countries in the authoritarian camp. The
United States and its allies will engage in geopolitical competition
with China and Russia in both military and economic domains. However,
the present era differs from the Cold War in several respects. Most
importantly, for the purposes of this book, [due to the spread of
information technology, the domain of information operations has become
a much more significant battleground in the broader geopolitical
landscape.]{.underline} As one commentator noted: "The new great- power
competition won't necessarily take place on battlefields . . . it will
happen on smartphones, computers, and other connected devices and on the
digital infrastructure that supports them."6 Currently, [U.S. social
media platforms--- primarily Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and
Instagram--- are critical battlefields in the ongoing competition
between democratic and authoritarian states]{.underline}. Russian
citizens use VK to communicate with each other via social media, but
Russian agents exploit U.S. social media platforms to conduct
information warfare in foreign countries. Chinese citizens use Sina
Weibo and other platforms to communicate with each other, but Chinese
cyber troops often use U.S. social media platforms to disseminate
foreign propaganda. (Chinese agents also use WeChat, a Chinese platform,
for this purpose.7 [) The power of democratic governments to regulate
social media could potentially give liberal democracies a major
strategic advantage in the information warfare domain]{.underline}.
Until now, Western democracies have squandered that advantage by
granting Chinese and Russian agents unrestricted access to U.S. social
media platforms. Those platforms are some of the most powerful weapons
available in the modern information warfare arsenal. [Chinese and
Russian cyber troops are deploying those weapons with great effect to
undermine liberal democratic norms. U.S. technology companies are
effectively subsidizing their information warfare activities by granting
them access to U.S. social media platforms.]{.underline}

[In the past, the word "authoritarian" brought to mind images of violent
repression, censorship, and intensive surveillance]{.underline}, an
image that. Today, however, [autocrats have a new set of tools that
allow them to be subtler in their methods of control]{.underline}, both
at home and abroad. [[The internet and social media are key to
autocrats' strategies for]{.mark} domestic stability and have been used
to great effect in [damaging confidence in democracy
worldwide]{.mark}]{.underline}. Though it is not the only country to use
social media in this way, in the American consciousness Russia is the
most controversial and sensational, and a perfect case study of the ways
[authoritarian [governments use]{.mark} the internet and [disinformation
to increase control at home and destabilize the idea of]{.mark} liberal
[democracy.]{.mark}]{.underline}

How is disinformation used within Russia?

While Russia does engage in censorship and restrict criticism of the
government, [[they also have a unique method of spreading
propaganda]{.underline}]{.mark}, which Christopher Paul and Miriam
Matthews of RAND call a "[[firehose of falsehood]{.underline}]{.mark}".
[Disinformation is spread through every type of media, constantly, and
at a high volume]{.underline}. [[Different narratives are completely
drowned out by the amount of false information]{.mark} being
disseminated]{.underline}, and [the high volume of different sources
both increase the number of recipients and render similar content more
believable.]{.underline} Falsehoods are often founded in truth, and
[desirable interpretations of real events are attributed to experts with
views opposite to what is presented.]{.underline}

These tactics make truth and reality difficult to grasp. [[With so much
information being put out]{.mark} constantly, it is impossible to refute
all of it]{.underline}. Moreover, [[it makes domestic political
engagement difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russian trolls invade popular
discourse (Kurowska & Reshetnikov), and [making it harder for citizens
to know whether what they are receiving is real political dissent or
manufactured content]{.underline}. For some, [[this might result in
cynicism and disengagement, because]{.mark} of a perception that [their
voices will never be heard]{.mark}.]{.underline}

How is social media used to spread disinformation abroad?

[[Russia's aggressive disinformation campaign]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the US [began]{.underline} in late 2014[, with general attempts to sow
chaos rather than to promote any specific narrative]{.underline}. [The
goals of the propaganda followed four general themes, including
[attempts to undermine confidence in democratic leaders and
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as finding and [exploiting
fault lines in society to increase social divisions]{.underline}. Even
their attempts to influence the 2016 US presidential election were
focused as much on creating distrust in elected officials. [[The
"firehose of falsehood" was turned on the US, aiming to create a similar
suspicion of media sources, and making reality hard to distinguish from
lies.]{.underline}]{.mark}

All of these tactics were used to great effect in Ukraine in 2013-2014.
Crimea's ethnic Russian population was bombarded with disinformation
from Russian state media, widely available and popular on the peninsula.
The news being presented portrayed the Euromaidan protests against
corruption as a threat to the safety of ethnic Russians in Crimea. This
exploitation of social tensions ultimately led to the annexation of
Crimea by Russia. The ethnic Russian populations of Donetsk and Luhansk
were also targeted, contributing to the ongoing war in the Donbass
region of Ukraine.

2\. Russian information warfare

2.1 Russian perspective [[Russia perceives the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark}]{.underline} the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization [([NATO) as existential threats]{.mark} to Its
existence]{.underline} (Zwack and Marie-Charlotte, 2019). It views
western nations as actively trying to displace the regime and disarm its
military capability (Costello and McReynolds, 2018). In response to this
danger, real or perceived[, Russia has exerted itself more aggressively
across the globe]{.underline} (Zwack and Marie-Charlotte, 2019). [[Power
projection]{.mark} and global influence [are means for Russia to elevate
itself]{.mark} to a world power and discourage threats to its
survival]{.underline}.

[[Russia\'s quest]{.mark} to achieve global influence [rests heavily on
the use of info]{.mark}rmation
[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. This spans a wide set of
options, [ranging from strategic deception and information manipulation
to hybrid warfare and offensive attacks]{.underline} (Krinstiina, 2016;
Zwack and Marie-Charlotte, 2019).

One of the primary ways [[Russia uses]{.mark} cyber and
[info]{.mark}rmation operations is [to shape]{.mark} the [geopolitical
environment by manipulating public opinion]{.mark}, both across the
globe and within its borders]{.underline} (Hans, 2018; ICA, 2017).
[[Russia]{.mark} uses information campaigns to [destabilize democracies
and]{.mark} incite domestic chaos in the nations it views as
opponents]{.underline} (Hans, 2018). [Russia uses information shaping
conducted in peacetime as a method to deter aggression and
[erode]{.mark} adversary [readiness]{.mark}]{.underline} (Zwack and
Marie-Charlotte, 2019). [In addition to manipulating foreign
perceptions, Russia uses information operations to influence its own
populace by spreading anti-West sentiment across the nation]{.underline}
(Kostyuk, Powell, and Skach 2018). The goal of this is to temper
domestic unrest by uniting its citizens against a common enemy (Costello
and McReynolds, 2018).

Another way [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} perceives cyber and
information operations is as a way to [conduct aggressive actions under
a veil of deception and shadow]{.underline} (Hans, 2018). The concept of
maskirovka, or military deception, is a fundamental part of Russian
thinking (Zwack and Marie-Charlotte, 2019). Cyber [operations are
conducted with less visibility than kinetic operations, can be difficult
to attribute, and are employed not only within the boundaries of a
military engagement]{.underline}, but across all of society. This is
because the battlefield is primarily logical and has unclear borders
between military forces and civilians. [Russia leverages these features
of cyberspace to [conduct actions within a \"gray zone,\" where]{.mark}
their [actions fall short of inciting]{.mark} [conflict yet still
degrade]{.mark} adversary [military capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Bernstein and Ball, 2015; Zwack and Marie-Charlotte, 2019).

Thirdly, [Russia views information warfare as a new and transformational
method of waging war to prevail in conflict]{.underline} (Hans, 2018).
Russia\'s political and military strategy will use hybrid warfare by
emphasizing non-traditional weapons of power, such as cyber,
information, and psychological effects (Krinstlina, 2016). [[Kinetic
forces]{.underline}]{.mark} will still be employed, but not as the
primary tool relied upon for success. Instead, they [[will be used
alongside asymmetric warfare operations]{.underline}]{.mark} and to
protect information security within the cyber domain (Hans, 2018;
Kostyuk, Powell, and Skach 2018). [Cyber operations will be used as a
combination of indirectly shaping adversary decisions and directly
delivering effects to destroy or degrade a target]{.underline} (Zwack
and Marie-Charlotte, 2019)

2.2 Organization Russian information operations are executed by both
government and non-government entities (Connell and Vogler, 2017).
Within the government, major players are the Federal Security Service
(FSB), the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), and the Ministry of
Defense (MOD) (Connell and Vogler, 2017). Another information-related
organization is the Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of
Telecommunications, Information Technologies, and Mass Communications
(Roskomnadzor), responsible for media regulation (Connell and Vogler,
2017). By regulating what ideas are presented in the media, this
organization influences domestic opinion in favor of national goals.

An important element of Russian information warfare is that many
activities are conducted by organizations not directly affiliated with
the Russian government but believed to be sponsored by it (Zwack and
Marie-Charlotte, 2019). Adding to the deception of cyber warfare, Russia
denies the awareness or support of these groups. However, the actions
conducted by them match Russian objectives well (Connell and Vogler,
2017). Russia is believed to work with criminal networks, such as the
Russian Business Network (RBN), and commercial companies such as media
outlets (Connell and Vogler, 2017; Krinstiina, 2016). [Partnership with
these companies allows the government to exert greater control over the
narrative and ideas presented to its populace]{.underline}.

2.3 Examples Many examples could be used to demonstrate Russian use of
cyber operations. Below are two selected to show how Russia uses
information operations to shape the strategic environment and to assist
in military conflict.

[A well-publicized example of Russia using information
operations]{.underline} to influence the geopolitical environment [Is
the Russian election meddling In the 2016 United States presidential
election]{.underline}. In the unclassified report on these activities,
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI), and the National Security Agency (NSA) assessed \"with high
confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence
campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election, the consistent
goals of which were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic
process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and
potential presidency\" (ICA, 2017). Regardless of whether President
Trump would have been elected without the Russian interference, this act
demonstrated the disruptive effect that information operations can
create. This is evidenced by the consistent media attention on the
possibility of a Russian influence campaign and the public outcry of the
invasion into the American democratic process. As stated earlier, one of
the goals of using information operations to shape the strategic
environment is to cause chaos and uncertainty, thereby weakening the
united strength of a democracy (Hans, 2018). As President Lincoln
famously stated, \"[[A house divided against itself cannot
stand]{.underline}]{.mark}. By generating domestic turmoil, Russia has
at the least caused internal conflict within the U.S., which stole
attention that could have been focused on international issues.

An example of Russian information operations employed during military
conflict can be seen from the conflict in Ukraine. Russia has been in
conflict with Ukraine since 2013, with particularly strained relations
since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 (Zwack and Marie-Charlotte, 2019;
Connell and Vogler, 2017). Russia used information operations of various
types throughout the entirety of this conflict. One way in which they
used Information campaigns had similar intent as that in the U.S.
election meddling---to destabilize public support by creating an air of
confusion and mistrust (Krinstiina, 2016). For example, Russia used
media in Ukraine and Russia to negatively portray Ukrainian soldiers and
criticize the Ukrainian government (Krinstilna, 2016). However, In this
case, the use of information operations did not stop at causing chaos.
Escalating from creating an atmosphere of confusion, pro-Russian groups
caused soldiers to mistrust their information systems and data via cyber
attacks (Connell and Vogler, 2017). Escalating even further, a presumed
Russian or Russian-sponsored group known as Sandworm conducted a
cyber-attack directed at the Ukrainian power grid (Kostyuk, Powell, and
Skach 2018; FireEye, 2016). The attack resulted in the western part of
the country losing power for several hours (Kostyuk, Powell, and Skach
2018). These information operation activities provide a real-world
example of how Russia will use cyber and Information effects In a
declared conflict.

3\. Chinese information warfare

3.1 Chinese perspective [Globalization has forced China to confront a
world order that challenges its traditional governance and
regime]{.underline} (Waldron, 2019). China is a leader in the
international system but did not become one until more than a century of
lagging behind further developed nations (Kissinger, 2011). These years
of \"suffering\" are a lesson and motivator for China to gain and
maintain a position of strength (Kolton 2017; Kissinger, 2011). Once it
entered the international arena, China emerged as a world power,
primarily due to its economic influence (Waldron, 2019). Economic
prowess alone, however, is not enough to preserve China\'s global
standing. To protect its national sovereignty, regime stability, and
regional dominance, China seeks to expand its influence to other areas.
A primary way China has been doing this is by modernizing and expanding
its military to gain strategic influence and be prepared for future
conflict (Kania and Costello, 2018; Domingo, 2016).

[[China views \"informationized\" warfare as the key to military
success]{.mark} and national security]{.underline} (Kolton, 2017). This
emphasis on information warfare stems from the study of previous
conflicts and factors that led to the victor\'s success (Clarke, 2019).
The start of this realization was In 1991 with the Persian Gulf War,
where China concluded that [an advantage in [Info]{.mark}rmation
[tech]{.mark}nology could [lead to overwhelming military
advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, China observed that an
opponent\'s dependency on information systems was a vulnerability that
could be exploited (Costello and McReynolds, 2018). In this conflict and
others since then, [China has observed how [technological strength
contributes to military success]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition to
military support, [China views information and technology as a way to
maintain internal stability]{.underline}. It is perceived as a method to
achieve and protect domestic and regional sovereignty. Based on these
perceptions, [[China uses info]{.mark}rmation superiority [to project
power, strengthen military capabilities, and maintain domestic
control]{.mark}]{.underline} (Clarke, 2019).

Information Warfare

[[Russia has a long history]{.mark} of demonstrating its mastery [of

Putin's regime has shifted to manipulating foreign target
audiences]{.underline}. Admittedly, propaganda and censorship have a
strong position internally. Nevertheless, [[Russian info]{.mark}rmation
[war]{.mark}fare increasingly [undermines]{.mark} other states'
[decision-making]{.mark}, deteriorates societal cohesion, and disputes
foreign leaders' authority and competence]{.underline}. Authoritarian
[[Russia]{.mark} has [solidified its role as a]{.mark} modern
[propaganda hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}. Conversely, democracies have
problems retaliating against this new soft and hard power mixture.
Russia's [state-driven media, officials, proxies, trolls, and
[politicians promote]{.mark} ideas, rumors, and [conspiracy theories
favorable to Russia]{.mark}, unconfirmed truths via official digital
channels, and biased social media accounts]{.underline}. Open
[information networks and technologies give Russian influencers [a fast
and cheap means to spread propaganda globally]{.mark}]{.underline}.35 As
an authoritarian state, [Russia effectively controls influencers, proxy
actors, and agents to conceal the Kremlin's fingerprints]{.underline}.
[[Russia]{.mark} and China have [spent millions]{.mark} of dollars
[increasing]{.mark} an asymmetric, aggressive, [info]{.mark}rmation
[war]{.mark}fare--[based "sharp power]{.mark}]{.underline}."36 Their
sharp power creates a hostile environment, [amplifying distrust and
discord among people and state institutions by piercing and penetrating
political and informational environments]{.underline}. Thus, the
[Kremlin has used sharp power, [which is more harmful than]{.mark}
traditional culture-based [soft power]{.mark}, to meddle in other
nations' elections and corrupt information in recent
years]{.underline}.37 Russia's meddling in the 2016 US presidential
[[election is the most visible example]{.underline}]{.mark} of
comprehensive information warfare. Though foreign interference efforts
have always played a role in policy making, handy, cheap new
technologies made organized propaganda and disinformation campaigns more
efficient and widespread than ever before.38 [[Strategic]{.mark} level
[info]{.mark}rmation warfare [undermined the]{.mark} US-led
[liberal]{.mark} world [order]{.mark} and the populace's belief in the
democratic presidential election system, developing a clear advantage
for Trump]{.underline}.39 Russian intelligence agencies illegally
intruded and interfered with Hillary Clinton's and the Democratic
National Committee's email accounts and leaked content on WikiLeaks,
causing political and social discord in America.40 Russian intelligence
agencies cunningly exploited all modern digital networks'
vulnerabilities. More importantly, the nonregulated human social media
networks multiplied the effects of distortion, dispute, and distrust.41
According to the intelligence community's assessments, President
[[Putin]{.mark} [ordered]{.mark} the multifaceted 2016 US presidential
[election meddling]{.mark} campaign---[demonstrating how centralized
hybrid warfare is in Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}.42 The all-encompassing
information campaign consisted of cyber espionage and intrusions against
political organizations and electoral boards, public disclosure of
collected data, propaganda, Russian state-owned news agency (Russia
Today, Sputnik) misinformation campaigns, and fake social media profiles
controlled by professional trolls from the socalled Internet Research
Agency in St. Petersburg.43 One worrisome phenomenon was that
[information warfare targeted partisan winners and losers differently;
the campaign was not directed against the whole country]{.underline}
like the examples of Pearl Harbor and 9/11.44 [Social-engineered
[divisive]{.mark} information [war]{.mark}fare [increased
partisanship]{.mark} in the US [and was a detrimental sting against

CHINA AND THE GLOBAL SOUTH

China's activities in the global South related to information and
communications technology raise two distinct concerns that are relevant
to the central themes of this book. First, [Chinese companies are
exporting surveillance technology to authoritarian
governments]{.underline} around the world. Such [exports facilitate the
rise of authoritarianism]{.underline} in the global South. Second,
[Chinese companies]{.underline} and government entities
[are]{.underline} increasingly [exerting control over]{.underline} the
[channels of communication in countries throughout the global
South]{.underline}. By controlling the channels of communication, [China
can shape the overall information environment in a way that supports its
broader effort to make the world safe for autocracy]{.underline}.

Exporting Surveillance Technologies

[Digital authoritarianism]{.underline} can be [defined as "the use
of]{.underline} digital [information technology]{.underline} by
authoritarian regimes to surveil, repress, and manipulate domestic and
foreign populations."169 The technology includes "high- resolution
cameras, facial recognition, spying malware, automated text analysis,
and big- data processing,"170 all supported by sophisticated artificial
intelligence (AI) [to facilitate mass surveillance of]{.underline}
ordinary [citizens]{.underline}. "The Chinese Communist Party is forging
a future of mass surveillance . . . and rapidly exporting those tools to
other parts of the world."171

As discussed previously (see pp. 84--86), private [Chinese companies are
exporting]{.underline} the technology of [digital authoritarianism, but
they are not alone.]{.underline} ["Firms]{.underline} based [in the
United States, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and Israel
are]{.underline} also [key suppliers]{.underline}."172 The technologies
that support digital authoritarianism are not inherently evil. [With
appropriate]{.underline} laws and [regulations]{.underline} in place,
democratic [countries can ensure that governments employ the technology
to enhance public welfare in a manner that is consistent with liberal,
democratic ideals]{.underline}. Unfortunately, when Chinese companies
export the technology to authoritarian countries, neither the exporting
nor the importing country is likely to insist on regulations to promote
liberal, democratic ideals. Absent such regulations, the tools of
[digital authoritarianism enable autocratic rulers to conduct mass
surveillance and identify political opponents]{.underline}. All too
often, identifcation of opponents leads to arbitrary arrest, torture,
and/or extrajudicial killing. A 2019 Freedom House report stated "that
47 of the 65 countries assessed featured arrests of \[social media\]
users for political, social, or religious speech--- a record high."173

The tools of [digital authoritarianism strengthen autocratic
rule]{.underline}. "Between 1946 and 2000--- the year digital tools
began to proliferate--- the typical dictator ruled for around ten years.
Since 2000, this number has more than doubled, to nearly 25 years."174
Moreover, "those authoritarian regimes that rely more heavily on digital
repression are among the most durable."175 Hence, commentators
legitimately fear "the emergence of an AI- powered [authoritarian bloc
led by China]{.underline} . . . \[that\] [could prevent
billions]{.underline} of people, [across large swaths of the globe, from
ever securing]{.underline} any measure of [political
freedom."]{.underline}176 China doves contend that "material interests,
not a universalist mission of promoting autocracy abroad, are the key
drivers of China's global strategy."177 Assuming the doves are correct,
their analysis should not be construed as an argument for complacency.
Chinese companies driven by the profit motive will likely help
autocratic rulers entrench their control unless there is countervailing
pressure to regulate surveillance technologies. Notably, the Chinese
government is not applying any such pressure.

It bears emphasis that [U.S. social media platforms, in the hands of
autocratic rulers, function as surveillance technologies]{.underline}.
That is no accident. Facebook and Google earn most of their revenue
through advertising. Companies and political candidates pay substantial
amounts of money for microtargeted advertising because Facebook and
Google have amassed a tremendous amount of information about us, the
targets of the ads. Thus, private companies routinely engage in
surveillance of social media users by collecting huge amounts of
information from billions of internet users to support the delivery of
microtargeted advertising. The information that social media companies
collect from their users is the raw material of "surveillance
capitalism."178

In the United States and other liberal democracies, governments do not
generally conduct surveillance on social media platforms because laws
enacted by democratic legislatures restrict government surveillance.
However, [authoritarian governments are increasingly exploiting U.S.
social media platforms for surveillance purposes]{.underline}. A 2019
Freedom House report stated: "At least 40 of the 65 countries covered by
this report have instituted advanced social media monitoring
programs."179 Moreover, "of the 15 countries in Asia assessed by this
report, 13 have social media surveillance programs under development or
in use."180 The report notes that "China is a leader in developing,
employing, and exporting social media surveillance tools."181

For example, a Chinese company called Semptian has developed the Aegis
surveillance system. The Aegis system "is designed to be installed
inside phone and internet networks, where it is used to secretly collect
people's email records, phone calls, text messages, cellphone locations,
and web browsing histories."182 The company's equipment is helping the
CCP "covertly monitor the internet and cellphone activity of up to 200
million people" in China. More recently, Semptian "has supplied the
equipment to authoritarian governments in the Middle East and North
Africa." Although a company spokesman refused to identify those
countries, an investigative journalist suggests that Semptian may have
sold Aegis to "Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates,
Oman, Sudan, and Egypt."183

Knowlesys is a Chinese company described as "an award- winning
surveillance industry veteran."184 Knowlesys "sells social media and
open source internet monitoring and analysis tools to . . . private
sector giants from both the East and West." The Knowlesys Intelligence
System "is available in almost a dozen languages including Arabic,
English, Chinese and Uighur." Governments use it "to effectively monitor
and analyze social media."185 In August 2020, a group of hackers
"obtained internal fi les from three Chinese social media monitoring
companies," including Knowlesys.186 The hackers offered journalists "a
large dump of fi les" that allegedly exposed "social media monitoring
and disinformation campaigns conducted by \[Knowlesys and two other\]
companies at the behest of the Chinese government."187

Thus, Chinese companies are strengthening autocratic rule in the global
South by exporting surveillance technology to authoritarian governments,
including technology that helps those governments exploit U.S. social
media platforms to conduct surveillance of their own citizens.

Controlling Channels of Communication

Marshall McLuhan famously declared that ["the medium is the message."
The CCP has built a global information strategy around this
idea.]{.underline} According to Peter Mattis, a China expert at the
Jamestown Foundation:

"Over the last ten years . . . [the push has been less about messaging
and more about the medium]{.underline}. This way [they]{.underline} can
[crowd out other stories]{.underline}, they can [have]{.underline}
essentially [a monopoly on the information environment]{.underline}---
[that makes it easier for their narratives to be received and
accepted]{.underline}."188 [China's effort to augment its control over
communication channels in the global South includes both hardware and
communications media]{.underline}.

With respect to hardware, a report by the Australian Strategic Policy
Institute shows that twelve key Chinese technology companies, in the
aggregate, are involved in "52 5G initiatives, across 34 countries . . .
56 undersea cables, 31 leased cables and 17 terrestrial cables; 202 data
centres and 305 telecommunications & ICT projects spread across the
world."189 A 2018 Freedom House report notes that Chinese companies have
"installed internet and mobile network equipment in at least 38
countries."190 [China can]{.underline} potentially [use its control over
information pipelines to engage in both surveillance and
censorship]{.underline}. "As more of the world's critical
telecommunications infrastructure is built by China, [global data may
become more accessible to Chinese intelligence
agencies]{.underline}."191 Indeed, according to one source, "there is
already evidence of [Chinese companies using]{.underline} their [control
over dissemination channels]{.underline} . . . [to suppress information
deemed undesirable by Beijing]{.underline}. But even where this
potential has not yet been activated, the foundations are being laid to
facilitate future manipulation."192

With respect to communications media, as discussed previously, [Chinese
state-run media operate hundreds of television and radio stations and
dozens of newspaper]{.underline}s in countries [throughout the
world]{.underline}. In addition, [China has been engaged in an "opaque
campaign of buying up broadcast space on foreign airwaves and inside
newspaper]{.underline}s. . . . Beijing has been able [to infiltrate
local media across the world]{.underline} by using overseas airwaves to
disseminate its message."193 For example, a "Reuters investigation
revealed there were at least 33 radio stations across 14 countries that
are part of a global radio web structured in a way that obscures its
majority shareholder: state- run China Radio International (CRI)."194
Xinhua "has signed exchange agreements with local counterparts" in many
countries, including Bangladesh, India, Nigeria, Egypt, Thailand,
Vietnam, Belarus, and Laos.195 Xinhua concluded an agreement with the
Thai News Network china's global information operations 111 allowing
Xinhua to broadcast its "China Report program in Thailand on a daily
basis." In South America, "TV Peru's Channel 7 broadcast 12
documentaries about China . . . in 2016, nearly all of which were
produced by CGTN and aired during prime time."196

[China's attempt to contro]{.underline}l the [information environment in
the global South appears to be gaining substantial traction in
Africa]{.underline}. StarTimes is a privately owned Chinese television
distribution company with close ties to the Chinese government.
"StarTimes has been a key player in the transition from analog to
digital transmission \[in Africa\], accruing over 10 million subscribers
in 30 countries."197 The company determines "which stations those
viewers are able to access." It appears to prioritize channels operated
by Chinese state media "at the expense of independent international news
stations."198 In early 2020, StarTimes launched a daily TV show with
news about the coronavirus pandemic for an African audience.199
StarTimes also entered into a joint venture with the state broadcaster
in Zambia. The deal allegedly "paves the way for a Chinese company to
control Zambia's national broadcasting service."200

One analysis suggests that "audiences in the West may prove a challenge
to win over--- but there is concern that Africa is more vulnerable to
China's creeping media buy- ups. . . . With a less robust media
environment and countless cash- strapped local networks, China has been
more active in infi ltrating and controlling African media."201 Public
opinion polling data from the Pew Research Center suggest that [China's
information operations in Africa are yielding positive
results]{.underline}. Polling data "indicated an overall decrease in
China's global favorability rating--- but African nations were among the
most likely to express favorable attitudes towards Beijing."202

The next chapter focuses on a single question: "If China and Russia are
using information warfare to attack liberal democracies, why don't we do
the same to them?" The short answer is that the situation is not
symmetrical. Russia and China are closed societies. The United States
and other liberal democracies are open societies. Social media offers
Russia and China a powerful tool to exploit our openness to undermine
democratic governance. However, we cannot use social media to undermine
authoritarian control in China and Russia because, in both countries,
authoritarian governments control social media. Chapter 5 shows that the
playing field is not level because social media and other digital
technologies systematically tilt the fi eld in favor of authoritarian
governance and against liberal democracy. The tilt in favor of
authoritarianism is not an inherent feature of the technology. Rather,
the uneven playing fi eld results from the interaction between
technology and regulatory strategies.

[Despite repeated warnings about the threat of Russian]{.underline} and
[Chinese information warfare to Canadian democracy]{.underline} over the
past years, policy-makers have done nothing to address it. We're now
seeing the consequences of our negligence, and [we can no longer
hesitate to defend ourselves]{.underline} against it.

[From Chinese government interference in Canada's last federal election
to Russian disinformation targeting COVID vaccines, lockdowns and ethnic
communities, foreign information warfare and influence operations are
threatening to tear apart the core fabric of our democracy and
society.]{.underline}

[The warnings bells have grown]{.underline} to a deafening din, yet
[we've chosen to maintain a dangerously narrow focus on foreign
interference]{.underline} in our elections. Over the past 24 months,
hostile [foreign governments]{.underline}, and those aligned with them,
[have intensified their attacks on our democracy, leveraging the fear,
uncertainty and anger that the pandemic has caused to divide
us.]{.underline}

This is nothing new. The [Russian government used vaccine hesitancy to
manipulate western societies]{.underline} since 2014, when it published
amplified anti-vaccination narratives targeting left-leaning suburban
families. Those campaigns were so effective that [the WHO proclaimed
vaccine hesitancy as the top global health threat in 2019, over a year
before the COVID virus first appeared.]{.underline}

During the initial months of the COVID pandemic, the European Union and
experts on information warfare warned the [Russian government would
exploit the crisis to intensify its effects and to "generate panic and
sow distrust."]{.underline} Indeed, Russian state media and their
proxies have unleashed an unrelenting firehose of disinformation and
COVID-related conspiracies that have provoked civil unrest from Berlin
to Ottawa.

Ideologically agnostic, Putin's only doctrine is power and the
consolidation of it. He does not share any of our democratic values nor
those of any of our mainstream political parties.

Over the past 22 years, he and the corrupt oligarchs who support him
have robbed the Russian state and people blind. Russian incomes have not
risen in over a decade and there is deep concern about corruption.
Russia's basic civil infrastructure hasn't developed beyond the 1980s:
in 2020 Russia's chief auditor reported that one-in-three Russian
hospitals lack running water.

[To maintain]{.underline} the [support]{.underline} of his people,
[Putin has created one crisis after another]{.underline}, from the 1999
apartment bombings to the new "genocide" in Eastern Ukraine. [He
manufactures enemies]{.underline} who conspire to suppress Russian power
and the reconstitution of the Soviet Union. Russian propagandists vilify
the LGBTQ community, NATO and Ukraine, even as Putin positions himself
as a heroic leader who will save his people from the chaos of democracy.

Over the course of the pandemic, Russian state media and platforms
aligned with it, including here in Canada, have aggressively published
and amplified narratives that question the existence of COVID, the
legitimacy of Canadian public health protocols and the safety of
vaccines. These include wild conspiracy theories that claim "big pharma"
is using the cover of COVID to inject citizens with poisonous substances
masquerading as vaccines. The Russian embassy in Canada has directly
published stories to promote hesitancy in western vaccines on its own
website.

[The trucker protests have been fuelled]{.underline}, in part, [by this
wave of disinformation. Riding on top of that wave are radical
extremists who have injected themselves into the protests. Their
caustic, anti-democratic messaging is now being legitimized and
amplified by Russian state media.]{.underline}

In recent weeks, [Russia state media]{.underline} coverage of the
protests has provided an international platform for extremists, who have
taken advantage of otherwise peaceful protests, [calling for the removal
of Canada's government. This represents direct interference by a Russian
government owned and controlled agency in Canada's democracy. By
legitimizing anti-democratic extremism, the Russian government is
normalizing and promoting it.]{.underline} When Canadian elected
officials promote Russian propaganda on social media and endorse it,
they become direct participants in [the Kremlin's cognitive warfare
against our democracy.]{.underline}

Accordingly, the argument in this chapter is directed toward a target
audience who agree that democratic decay is a significant problem and
that foreign threats to liberal democracy are significant causal factors
contributing to that problem. If those two assumptions are correct, it
follows almost inexorably that Chinese and Russian information warfare
constitutes a significant threat to liberal democracy. Clearly the
category of foreign threats to liberal democracy is broader than just
information warfare (see figure 3 in chapter 1). Nevertheless, [[there
is]{.mark} a [broad consensus among]{.mark}]{.underline} relevant
[[experts that Chinese and Russian info]{.mark}rmation [war]{.mark}fare
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} one of the most salient foreign threats--- if

#### Democracy solves extinction

The Soviet Union was an existential threat, and this focused the
attention of the world, and the American people. There existential
threat today is not found on a map, but it is very real. [The forces of
the past are making steady progress against the modern world
order. Terrorist movements]{.underline} in the Middle East, [extremist
parties]{.underline} across Europe, a paranoid tyrant in [North
Korea]{.underline} [threatening nuclear blackmail]{.underline}, and, at
the center of the web, an aggressive KGB dictator
in [Russia]{.underline}. They all want to [turn the world back to a dark
past because their survival is threatened by the values of the free
world,]{.underline} epitomized by the United States. [And they are
thriving as the U.S. has retreated]{.underline}.The global freedom index
has declined for ten consecutive years. No one like to talk about the
United States as a global policeman, but this is what happens when there
is no cop on the beat. American leadership [begins at home]{.underline},
right here. [America cannot lead the world on democracy and human
rights if there is no unity on the meaning and importance of these
things]{.underline}. Leadership is required to make that case clearly
and powerfully. Right now, Americans are engaged in politics at a level
not seen in decades. It is an opportunity for them to rediscover that
making America great begins with believing America can be great. The
Cold War was won on American values that were shared by both parties and
nearly every American. Institutions that were created by a Democrat,
Truman, were triumphant forty years later thanks to the courage of a
Republican, Reagan. This bipartisan consistency created the decades
of [strategic stability that is the great strength of
democracies. Strong institutions that outlast politicians allow for
long-range planning]{.underline}. In
contrast, [dictators ]{.underline}can operate only tactically, not
strategically, because they are not constrained by the balance of
powers[, but cannot afford to think beyond their own
survival]{.underline}. This is why a dictator like Putin has an
advantage in chaos, the ability to move quickly. This can only be met by
strategy, by long-term goals that are based on shared values, not on
polls and cable news. The fear of making things worse has paralyzed the
United States from trying to make things better. There will always be
setbacks, but the United States cannot quit. The spread of [democracy is
the only proven remedy for nearly]{.underline} [every crisis that
plagues the world today. War, famine, poverty,
terrorism]{.underline}--[all are generated and exacerbated by
authoritarian regimes]{.underline}. A policy of America First inevitably
puts American security last.American leadership is required because
there is no one else, and because it is good for America. There is no
weapon[ or wall that is more powerful for security than America being
envied, imitated, and admired around the world]{.underline}. Admired not
for being perfect, but for having the exceptional courage to always try
to be better. Thank you.

countries]{.mark}.]{.underline} Specifically, there are three categories
of hypothetical and non-directional arguments why democracy can be
related to biodiversity conservation, all of them related to the
opportunity structure that actors face (see e.g. Midlarsky 1998;
Neumayer 2002; Li and Reuveny 2006 for a more detailed description of
the links between democracy, biodiversity conservation, and
environmental quality in general). [First, the political
rights]{.underline}, normally associated with democracy, including the
freedom of association, the freedom of expression, and the freedom of
press, together allow for a more productive involvement of citizens in
politics, [both through political parties and civil society
organizations and to participate in or lobby
decision-making]{.underline}. [[Political rights]{.mark} also [allow for
the media]{.mark} and other actors [to address biodiversity issues
through shaping the public opinion and affecting the policy
agenda]{.mark}]{.underline} (Li and Reuveny 2006). Second, when the
faith of political leaders are largely decided by citizens through
repeated, free, and fair elections with universal suffrage, the
expectation is that [this [vertical accountability electoral
mechanism]{.mark} should [promote the distribution of environmental
public goods]{.mark}]{.underline} (Li and Reuveny 2006), [[including
positive impacts on biodiversity conservation]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Additionally, [[elections]{.mark} as the normal way of selecting leaders
[tend to reduce short-term uncertainty about political
survival]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e. fear of being removed from office)
[thus [allowing actors to allocate more resources to long-term
strategies]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wurster 2013). [This can be expected
to, for example, promote policies that are better aligned with future
needs]{.underline} ([[i.e. conserving biodiversity]{.mark} for future
generations]{.underline}) or allow political parties to compete for
support with more or less ''green'' agendas. Third, through the
political constraints that leaders face with increasing liberal
democratic institutions, for example the rule of law, [[judicial
constraints, and legislative constraints can foster compliance with
legislation and international treaties]{.underline}]{.mark} (Li and
Reuveny 2006). [Constraining leaders also decreases their possibilities
to act opportunistically, [which]{.mark} should [provide incentives for
other actors to cooperate in the management of biodiversity]{.mark} as
it introduces stronger mutual expectations of lawful
behaviour]{.underline} (Sjo¨stedt 2013). [This may well be expected to
have a positive effect on biodiversity.]{.underline}

#### Biodiversity Loss causes [Extinction]{.underline}.

**Torres 16** Phil Torres 4-11-2016 "Biodiversity loss: An existential
risk comparable to climate change"
thebulletin.org/biodiversity-loss-existential-risk-comparable-climate-change9329
(founder of the X-Risks Institute, an affiliate scholar at the Institute
for Ethics and Emerging Technologies)

The sixth extinction. The repercussions of biodiversity loss are
potentially as severe as those anticipated from climate change, or even
a nuclear conflict. For example, according to a 2015 study published in
Science Advances, [the best available [evidence reveals]{.mark} "an
exceptionally [rapid loss of biodiversity]{.mark} over the last few
centuries, indicating that [a sixth mass extinction is]{.mark} already
[under way]{.mark}." This conclusion holds, even on the most optimistic
assumptions]{.underline} about the background rate of species losses and
the current rate of vertebrate extinctions. The group classified as
"vertebrates" includes mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and all other
creatures with a backbone. The article argues that, using its
conservative figures, [the average loss of vertebrate species was 100
times higher in the past century relative to the background rate of
extinction]{.underline}. (Other scientists have suggested that the
current extinction rate could be as much as 10,000 times higher than
normal.) As the authors write, "The evidence is incontrovertible that
recent extinction rates are unprecedented in human history and highly
unusual in Earth's history." Perhaps the term "Big Six" should enter the
popular lexicon---to add the current extinction to the previous "Big
Five," the last of which wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.
But [the concept of biodiversity encompasses more than just the total
number of species on the planet. It also refers to the size of different
populations of species.]{.underline} With respect to this phenomenon,
[multiple studies have confirmed that wild populations around the world
are dwindling and disappearing at an alarming rate.]{.underline} For
example, the 2010 Global Biodiversity Outlook report found that the
population of wild vertebrates living in the tropics dropped by 59
percent between 1970 and 2006. The report also found that the population
of farmland birds in Europe has dropped by 50 percent since 1980; bird
populations in the grasslands of North America declined by almost 40
percent between 1968 and 2003; and the population of birds in North
American arid lands has fallen by almost 30 percent since the 1960s.
Similarly, 42 percent of all amphibian species (a type of vertebrate
that is sometimes called an "ecological indicator") are undergoing
population declines, and 23 percent of all plant species "are estimated
to be threatened with extinction." Other studies have found that some 20
percent of all reptile species, 48 percent of the world's primates, and
50 percent of freshwater turtles are threatened. Underwater, about 10
percent of all coral reefs are now dead, and another 60 percent are in
danger of dying. Consistent with these data, the 2014 Living Planet
Report shows that the global population of wild vertebrates dropped by
52 percent in only four decades---from 1970 to 2010. While biologists
often avoid projecting historical trends into the future because of the
complexity of ecological systems, it's tempting to extrapolate this
figure to, say, the year 2050, which is four decades from 2010. As it
happens, [a 2006 study published in Science]{.underline} does precisely
this: It [projects past trends of marine biodiversity loss into the 21st
century, concluding that, unless significant changes are made to
patterns of human activity, there will be virtually no more wild-caught
seafood by 2048.]{.underline} Catastrophic consequences for
civilization. [The consequences of this rapid pruning of the
evolutionary tree of life extend beyond the obvious. There could be
surprising effects of biodiversity loss that scientists are unable to
fully anticipate in advance]{.underline}. For example, prior research
has shown that [localized ecosystems can undergo abrupt and irreversible
shifts when they reach a tipping point]{.underline}. According to a 2012
paper published in Nature, there are reasons for thinking that [[we may
be approaching a tipping point]{.mark} of this sort in the global
ecosystem]{.underline}, beyond which [the [consequences could be
catastrophic]{.mark}]{.underline} for civilization. As the authors
write, a planetary-scale transition [could precipitate ["substantial
losses of ecosystem services required to sustain the human
population]{.mark}."]{.underline} An ecosystem service is any ecological
process that benefits humanity, [[such as food production and crop
pollination]{.underline}]{.mark}. [If the global ecosystem were to cross
a tipping point and substantial ecosystem services were lost, [the
results]{.mark} could be "[widespread social unrest, economic
instability, and loss of human life."]{.mark}]{.underline} According to
Missouri Botanical Garden ecologist Adam Smith, one of the paper's
co-authors, [this could occur in]{.underline} a matter of
[decades]{.underline}---far more quickly than most of the expected
consequences of climate change, yet equally destructive. [[Biodiversity
loss is a "threat multiplier" that,]{.mark} by pushing societies to the
brink of collapse, [will exacerbate existing conflicts and introduce
entirely new struggles]{.mark} between state and non-state
actors.]{.underline} Indeed, [it could even fuel the rise of
terrorism]{.underline}. (After all, climate change has been linked to
the emergence of ISIS in Syria, and multiple high-ranking US officials,
such as former US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and CIA director John
Brennan, have affirmed that climate change and terrorism are connected.)
The reality is that we are entering the sixth mass extinction in the
3.8-billion-year history of life on Earth, and the impact of this event
could be felt by civilization "in as little as three human lifetimes,"
as the aforementioned 2012 Nature paper notes. Furthermore, [the
widespread decline of biological populations could plausibly initiate a
dramatic transformation of the global ecosystem on an even faster
timescale: perhaps a single human lifetime.]{.underline} The unavoidable
conclusion is that [[biodiversity loss constitutes an existential
threat]{.mark} in its own right]{.underline}. As such, [it ought to be
considered alongside climate change and nuclear weapons as one of the
most significant contemporary risks to human prosperity and
survival.]{.underline}

## IL\-\--Anti-Nuclear Movements 

### IL\-\--Anti-Nuclear Movements 

#### Targeted [misinformation campaigns]{.underline} erode [NATO cohesion]{.underline} and distract from regulation of [Russian nuclear stockpiling.]{.underline}

Lesley **Kucharski 18,** Counterproliferation Analyst at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, "Russian Multi-Domain Strategy against
NATO: information confrontation and U.S. forward-deployed nuclear
weapons in Europe,"

Western philosophical and moral principles incline strategic thinkers in
democratic societies to reject the notion that [information can be used
as a weapon or a domain of warfare]{.underline} instead of a tool of
freedom and truth. International law suggests that the vast majority of
societies and governments agree that freedom of information and truth
are crucial to healthy societies. In practice, however, there are also
governments that perceive them as both a form of strategic deception and
as a vulnerability that can be exploited through information operations.

[An increasingly common dimension of [Russian strategy
against]{.mark}]{.underline} the United States and its [[NATO]{.mark}
allies]{.underline} and partners [[is info]{.mark}rmation
[confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline} \[informatsionnoe protivoborstvo\],
or IPb. [[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} actively [[pursues a strategy of
exploiting perceived vulnerabilities]{.mark} of these democratic
societies [by]{.mark} carrying out [info]{.mark}rmational-technical
(e.g., [cyber]{.mark}]{.underline}) and informational-psychological
[[operations]{.underline}]{.mark} below the threshold of open military
conflict [in order [to exacerbate]{.mark} pre-existing societal,
political, and military [divisions]{.mark}, thereby [degrading NATO
cohesion.]{.mark}]{.underline} 1 The literature on IPb suggests that [a
key element of this strategy is an effort to create confusion and sow
doubt]{.underline} in the existence of truth.2 [Russia]{.underline} has
[also applied these operations]{.underline} alongside traditional
military means of armed conflict in NATO partner states, Georgia and
Ukraine, in order [to slow down the decision-making
processes]{.underline} in those countries as well as throughout the
international community. In Georgia and Ukraine, Russia has employed
both aspects of IPb to challenge the Westphalian international order and
achieve a fait accompli with a limited use of military force.

The body of literature dedicated to understanding the role of IPb in
Russian strategy has yet to explore its relationship to U.S. extended
nuclear deterrence. This topic merits study for at least three reasons.
First, [[Russian]{.underline}]{.mark} strategic thinkers and official
[strategic [documents identify]{.mark}]{.underline} [[NATO]{.mark} as
threat [and assign an increased role for]{.mark}]{.underline}
asymmetric, indirect, and non-military (including
[[info]{.mark}rmational) [measures]{.mark}]{.underline} [i]{.mark}n
conflict resolution (see section 3). Second, Russia has historically
used IPb against the Alliance with mixed success. In this regard, Soviet
active measures \[aktivnie meropriyatiya\] operations targeting
societal, political, and military divisions about NATO nuclear posture
in the late 1970s and early 1980s are illuminating (see section 4).
Finally, [[current Russian practice reflects an effort to propagate
disinformation about U.S. forward-deployed nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} (see section 5)

This study seeks to contribute to the body of literature on IPb by
analyzing the evolution of Russian strategic thought on and practice of
IPb in relation to U.S. forward-deployed nuclear weapons in Europe. It
explores the following questions: How and under which conditions does
[[Russia employ IPb]{.mark} in an effort [to achieve]{.mark} preferred
[strategic outcomes related to NATO nuclear force
structure]{.mark}?]{.underline} What insights about contemporary Russian
IPb efforts can be gained from studying Soviet active measures campaigns
against NATO nuclear force posture? [Analysis of trends in Russian
strategic thinking, official Russian strategic documents, and two cold
war case studies suggest that IPb operations targeting societal,
political, and military divisions within NATO regarding the role of U.S.
forward-deployed nuclear weapons in its defense and deterrence posture
are an important feature of Russia's multi-domain strategy against
NATO]{.underline}. As the Soviet Union did, Russia pursues a two-tiered
strategy "from above" and "from below" that exploits pre-existing
divisions and perceived vulnerabilities of democracies.3 Rather than
seeking to create confusion and sow doubt in the existence of truth in
order to exacerbate existing divisions as the literature on IPb
suggests, however, [[Russia promotes]{.mark} very specific, historically
consistent, and simple political and [security narratives]{.mark} about
U.S. forward deployed nuclear weapons [that]{.mark} resonate with the
growing anti-nuclear weapons movement in democratic societies and
[deflect attention from its own large stockpile of]{.mark} non-strategic
[nuclear weapons.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Russian IPb strategy differs from Soviet strategy due to three
structural factors: the characteristics of modern warfare, the
contemporary information ecosystem and its associated information
technologies, and the increased influence of non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) on global politics. These three structural changes
allow Russia to blur the distinction between its campaigns "from above"
and "from below" in a way that the Soviet Union could not. For example[,
it has covertly planted disinformation about U.S. forward-deployed
nuclear weapons into the information ecosystem using small independent
internet news agencies]{.underline} and enjoyed the subsequent
proliferation of its story and narrative across the world by other news
agencies which picked up the story and through social media websites
like Twitter. By leveraging this new information environment, Russia
seeks to influence government officials as well as the general public
rather than targeting one specific group. Furthermore, [[Russia
leverages the]{.mark} contemporary [information ecosystem to promote its
narratives without needing to tie its hands to the anti-nuclear weapons
movement]{.mark} through front organizations or foreign political
parties as the Soviet Union did.]{.underline} It no longer needs to fund
civil society organizations like the World Peace Council (WPC) in an
effort to enhance the legitimacy of its narratives because NGOs that
agree with Russian narratives about the dangers of NATO's nuclear
posture today are more numerous and have more political influence and
larger endowments than similar organizations during the cold war period.
The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN)---the NGO
which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017 for promoting nuclear
disarmament and its leadership in advocating the Treaty on the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW)---and its 532 partner
organizations in 103 countries is an example of this structural change.
One significant consequence of these structural changes is that the
pressure to pursue arms control arrangements is directed primarily at
NATO instead of being distributed across NATO and Russia as it was
distributed across NATO and the Soviet Union in the late 1970s and early
1980s.

1\. [Increase NATO's capacity to understand and respond to threats in
the information space]{.underline}

66\. [[Member states should expand NATO's]{.mark}]{.underline} human,
financial, and technological [[resources]{.mark} dedicated [to fighting
disinfo]{.mark}rmation and propaganda to match]{.underline} both [the
level of the threat]{.underline} and the Alliance's ambitions to counter
it. Such [resources would]{.underline} help [strengthen NATO's capacity
to monitor]{.underline} the [information]{.underline} environment in
which it operates [and respond to]{.underline} any [hostile information
activity]{.underline}.

67\. [NATO and its [member countries should improve]{.mark}]{.underline}
their [[understanding of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[domestic
vulnerabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} to disinformation and propaganda
faced by the Allies. In particular, the [Alliance should]{.underline}
better [account]{.underline} in its counter-disinformation efforts for
[the role of citizens]{.underline} within its borders [in the spread of
disinformation]{.underline}. Additionally, [[NATO should carry
out]{.underline}]{.mark} regular in-depth [[assessments]{.mark} in
all]{.underline} 30 member [states to identify]{.underline} and monitor
specific national [vulnerabilities]{.underline} to disinformation and
propaganda, similar to the surveys that it carries out every two years
to assess the state of civil preparedness in Allied countries. These
assessments could be [[carried out by]{.underline}]{.mark} peers or a
group of [[experts]{.underline}]{.mark}. Based on the insight gained in
such assessments, [NATO should shift from a]{.underline} broad and
[one-size-fits-all]{.underline} communication strategy [to
a]{.underline} more [tailored approach]{.underline} better
[targeting]{.underline} the [groups most vulnerable to
disinformation]{.underline} and propaganda in each Allied country. As
such, [these [assessments would]{.mark} help NATO make]{.underline} the
[most of its]{.underline} limited [resources and
[give]{.mark}]{.underline} member [[states]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[better [understanding of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[shortfall
areas]{.underline}]{.mark} in which they could focus their efforts. In
addition to this regular monitoring, member states should make more
frequent use of the NATO Counter-Hybrid Support Teams to identify
vulnerabilities to disinformation ahead of or during sensitive events,
such as elections. Similarly, [[Allied countries should]{.mark} actively
[use]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[expertise of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
relevant [[NATO centers]{.underline}]{.mark} of excellence, including
the Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence.

68\. [[NATO should step up its response to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[disinfo]{.mark}rmation and propaganda]{.underline} campaigns launched
[by authoritarian states,]{.underline} particularly Russia and China. As
[many of the]{.underline} [[false]{.underline}]{.mark} or misleading
[[narratives]{.underline}]{.mark} promoted by these actors [[are
predictable, NATO should increase]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[efforts to
prebunk]{.underline}]{.mark} such [messages]{.underline} at early stages
[before they spread]{.underline} widely, rather than debunk them once
they have achieved broad circulation. At the same time, careful
consideration must be given to which claims should be actively refuted
and which should not. Indeed, disproving claims that have not yet been
widely disseminated can be counterproductive as it may inadvertently
give them increased visibility.

69\. NATO and its member states should further bolster their efforts to
increase public knowledge about the Alliance. Better educating Allied
publics about the Alliance's values, objectives, and benefits would
indeed contribute to countering disinformation about NATO. To achieve
this goal, however, NATO and individual member countries should shift
the primary focus of their communications strategies from countering
negative narratives to actively communicating positive narratives about
the successes of the Alliance. They should continue promoting NATO's
achievements and solidarity, as they have successfully done in the
context of the response to the pandemic.

70\. [[NATO should]{.underline}]{.mark} further [[increase]{.mark} the
[coordination of counter-disinfo]{.mark}rmation efforts [between Allied
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} and with partners. The [[wide-reaching
nature]{.mark} of disinformation campaigns [means]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [[responses should be transatlantic]{.underline}]{.mark} in scope
[[and]{.mark} inherently [collaborative. NATO can]{.mark} play a more
active role in [coordinat]{.mark}ing [national efforts
and]{.mark}]{.underline} in [[shar]{.mark}ing [best practices]{.mark}
amongst member states]{.underline} and partner countries
[for]{.underline} possible [replication]{.underline}. To that end, [NATO
should develop a taxonomy of national measures adopted by NATO member
states]{.underline} and partner countries, as well as countries that are
not NATO partners but have experience in countering disinformation.

2\. Create a framework that places democratic resilience and efforts to
counter disinformation and propaganda at the center of NATO's future

71\. [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and the Allies [[should
ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[countering
disinfo]{.mark}rmation]{.underline} and propaganda, and strengthening
democratic resilience more broadly, [[are part and parcel
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [ongoing discussions on NATO's future,
including [the]{.mark}]{.underline} NATO 2030 process and the [update of
the [S]{.mark}trategic [C]{.mark}oncept]{.underline}.

72\. The Allies should reaffirm their shared commitment to democratic
values and principles by establishing a Center for Democratic Resilience
within NATO, as suggested by the NATO PA President Gerald Connolly and
subsequently recommended by the NATO 2030 Group of experts (Connolly,
2019; Group of experts, 2020). Structurally similar to the Euro-Atlantic
Disaster Response Coordination Centre, this Center would provide
technical and research support to member states in strengthening
democratic resilience, ensuring greater societal cohesion, resisting
hostile interference, and responding to disinformation from external and
internal actors. To do so, the Center would, first, monitor, identify,
and highlight vulnerabilities in member states in the areas of
democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Second, the Center would
assist member states, upon request, in the development of institutions,
laws, and policies to tackle corruption, foster trust in elections, and
respond to other governance challenges. Through these two strands of
work, the Center would play a key role in supporting member states in
recognizing and remedying democratic vulnerabilities that could
otherwise be used by malevolent actors to spread disinformation and
propaganda within the Alliance. Although institutionally part of NATO,
the Center would harness the experience and knowledge of civil society
experts and think tanks and could include an advisory group of external
experts. The creation of the Center for Democratic Resilience, as a
structure within NATO, would symbolize the enduring commitment of all
Allies to uphold the founding democratic principles of the North
Atlantic Treaty.

73\. Member states should support the development of the Euro-Atlantic
Centre for Resilience in Romania. This Centre, although not a NATO
structure, constitutes a useful international resource for NATO, Allied
countries and their partners to discuss threats to their resilience,
including in the information space; to develop analytical tools and best
practices to counter these threats; and to increase joint education and
training activities in this area. The development of this Centre and the
proposal to create a Center for Democratic Resilience within NATO should
not, however, be opposed, as both institutions will play complementary
roles. The Euro-Atlantic Centre for Resilience focuses on analysis,
exchange, training and cooperation (including with partners outside the
organization, notably neighboring countries and the EU), whereas the
Center for Democratic Resilience will internally assist member states in
operationally responding to threats to democratic values.

74\. [[NATO should make]{.underline}]{.mark} the ongoing [development of
[a counter]{.mark}-]{.underline}hostile information and
[[disinfo]{.mark}rmation [toolbox]{.mark}]{.underline} for Allies [[a
priority]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition to outlining key definitions,
approaches, and response options at the national level, [[it could be
used as a basis to establish NATO-level standards]{.mark} for resilience
to disinformation]{.underline} and propaganda. [Member states could
use]{.underline} such [standards [to set national targets]{.mark} and
compare]{.underline} their [progress]{.underline} to that of other
Allies. This could include common standards in terms of the
institutional structure designated to address disinformation threats,
the financial and human resources allocated, and the legal framework.

75\. NATO and Allied countries should reflect on options for a more
offensive counter-disinformation approach. [The [Alliance should]{.mark}
consider developing a strategy that would [impose]{.mark}]{.underline}
greater [[costs on malevolent actors]{.mark} aggressively
[disrupting]{.mark} the [info]{.mark}rmation space]{.underline}. NATO
has recognized that a serious hybrid attack, such as a cyberattack,
could trigger Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, where an attack
against one Ally is treated as an attack against all (Stoltenberg,
2019). Attention should be paid to the conditions under which a
disinformation or propaganda campaign could be considered a possible
trigger. [The [Alliance cannot remain passive in the face of hostile
infor]{.mark}mation [activity which]{.mark} threatens to
[undermine]{.mark} the [foundations of]{.mark} our [democratic
institutions]{.mark} and societies.]{.underline}

#### NATO is key to implement a cognitive warfare monitoring and alert system - that allows member states to effectively track and respond to cognitive warfare campaigns

[The need for awareness]{.underline}

[[The advantage in cognitive warfare goes to]{.underline}]{.mark} him
[[who moves first]{.mark} and chooses the time, place, and means of the
offensive.]{.underline} [Cognitive warfare can be waged using a variety
of vectors and media]{.underline}. The openness of social media
platforms allows [adversaries easily to target individuals, selected
groups, and the public]{.underline} via social messaging, social media
influencing, selective release of documents, video sharing, etc. [Cyber
capabilities permit the use of spearfishing, hacking, and tracking of
individuals and social networks.]{.underline}

[[A proper defence requires]{.mark} at the very least an [awareness that
a cognitive warfare campaign is underway]{.mark}]{.underline}. It
requires the ability to observe and orient before decision-makers can
decide to act. [Technology solutions can provide the means to answer
some key questions]{.underline}: Is there a campaign going on? Where did
it originate? Who is waging it? What might be its aims? Our research
indicates that [[there are patterns of such campaigns that
repeat]{.mark} and can be classified]{.underline}. [[They]{.mark} may
even [provide "signatures" unique to]{.mark} specific [actors that
can]{.mark} help to [identify them.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A particularly useful technology solution may be [[a cognitive warfare
monitoring and alert system]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such a system could
help to [[identify cognitive warfare campaigns as they arise, and to
track them as they progress. It]{.underline}]{.mark} could include a
dashboard that [[integrates data from a wide range of]{.mark} social
media, broadcast media, social messaging, and social networking
[sites]{.mark}]{.underline}. This would display geographic and social
network maps that show the development of suspected campaigns over time.

[By identifying the locations,]{.underline} both geographic and virtual,
in which social media posts, messages, and news articles originate, the
topics under discussion, sentiment and linguistic identifiers, pacing of
releases, and other factors, [[a dashboard]{.mark} could [reveal
connections and repeating patterns]{.mark}]{.underline}. Links between
social media accounts (for example, shares, comments, interactions) and
their timing could be observed. [The use of [machine learning and
pattern recognition algorithms]{.mark} could help [quickly]{.mark} to
[identify]{.mark} and classify [emerging campaigns without the need for
human intervention.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Such a system would allow real-time monitoring and provide timely alerts
to NATO and Alliance decision-makers, helping them to formulate
appropriate responses to campaigns as they emerge and evolve.

[Considerations on resilience]{.underline}

Since the early days of the Alliance, [[NATO]{.mark} has [played an
essential role in promoting]{.mark} and enhancing [civil
preparedness]{.mark} among its member states.]{.underline} Article 3 of
the NATO founding treaty establishes the principle of resilience, which
requires all Alliance member states to "maintain and develop their
individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack." This
includes supporting the continuity of government, and the provision of
essential services, including resilient civil communications systems.

Some key considerations for [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} at this time are
how [[best to take the lead in defining cognitive attacks]{.underline},
[how to help Alliance members maintain awareness]{.underline}]{.mark},
and how to support more robust civil communications infrastructures and
public education frameworks in order to enhance the capacity to resist
and to respond.

Russia could launch a conventional military invasion of Ukraine at any

Russia's Hybrid Warfare Strategy

Russia's strategy is centered on promoting a narrative of grievances.
Russia believes the United States is using Ukraine and promoting NATO
expansion to contain Russian national security interests and encroach on
its traditional spheres of influence. It also contends that Ukraine
should return to the Minsk Agreements and end its attempt to win back
Donbas. These are false narratives because sovereign and independent
states have the freedom to determine their own path and seek membership
in any alliance. And it would be madness for the Ukrainian government to
retake Donbas given the Russian military presence there. The [Russian
rhetoric is a trojan horse created by the Kremlin to]{.underline}
renegotiate the end of the Cold War and [redraw European
borders]{.underline} the same way Russia did when it illegally annexed
Crimea in 2014.

The [effectiveness of]{.underline} the [Russian narrative depends on
combining]{.underline} conventional [military]{.underline} positioning
[with hybrid tactics]{.underline} or "active measures." Hybrid actions
taken in the so-called "gray-zone" typically consist of measures short
of conventional warfare such as limited strikes, special operations
forces, raids, cyber attacks, and covert influence operations. [Hybrid
warfare is]{.underline} a [central]{.underline} element [of Russia's
military]{.underline} strategy, in which operatives remain just below
the radar and work with proxies to stage false flags to justify an
invasion. To crush the Prague Spring in 1968, Soviet operatives in
Czechoslovakia planted weapons in packages labeled "Made in the USA,"
which were published in Soviet state-controlled outlets as signs of a
U.S.-led plot. The KGB ran active measures during the Soviet war in
Afghanistan in the 1980's, often using "false bands" of Afghan units
posing as CIA-backed guerillas to justify Soviet military operations.

Misinformation and [disinformation are quickly and efficiently
distributed through news]{.underline} channels [and social
media]{.underline} to influence public opinion. Russian [state-owned
outlets]{.underline} Russia Today (RT), Tass, and Sputnik [have a strong
presence]{.underline} on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Telegram,
echoing the Kremlin's position and [portraying NATO]{.underline} and the
United States [as aggressors]{.underline}. In 2013-2014, [Russian
state]{.underline} media [framed the Maidan protests]{.underline} that
toppled Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych [as "fomented by the
U.S.]{.underline} in cooperation with fascist Ukrainian nationalists"
that were used as a pretext for Russia's little green men to seize
Crimea.

One Russian-backed channel on YouTube is НАШ or NASH TV, which has been
promoting Russia's narrative until it was banned in Ukraine. Founded by
former pro-Russia Ukraine parliament member Yevheniy Murayev, [NASH TV
is a Kremlin mouth piece flooding viewers with anti-American and
anti-NATO falsehoods]{.underline}. Last month, the United Kingdom
accused Russia of attempting to overthrow Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky and replace him with Murayev. This is the same approach used by
Russia when it seized Crimea and installed Sergey Aksyonov as the
so-called Prime Minister of Crimea.

[Sustained Russian information operations reinforce]{.underline}
specific elements in [Moscow's narrative of grievances]{.underline}.
First, [NATO's]{.underline} eastward [expansion]{.underline} since the
end of the Cold War [is the real threat, not Russia]{.underline}.
Second, [Ukraine and Georgia joining NATO would threaten]{.underline}
the European [security order]{.underline}. Third, the [annexation of
Crimea and support for separatists in Donbas are
liberations]{.underline} of Russian-speaking communities.

[Troll factories and bots spread large volumes of fake news]{.underline}
stories, making it almost impossible to counter the steady deluge of
disinformation. On January 31, it Western media reported that Russia
planted fake stories about bomb threats against Ukrainian schools and
shopping malls, forcing children to online learning and closing
businesses. Just last week, U.S. [officials uncovered a
plot]{.underline} by Russian intelligence [to fabricate a propaganda
video portraying fake explosions]{.underline}, corpses, [and grieving
women]{.underline} designed [to legitimate a Russian
invasion]{.underline} to protect civilians [in Ukraine]{.underline}.

[Russia supplements information operations with cyber attacks. Russian
hackers]{.underline} recently [breached Ukrainian networks]{.underline},
replacing publicly facing websites with messages in Ukrainian and Polish
designed to look like a Polish cyber operation. Russian cyber attacks
[targeted Georgian networks]{.underline} during the 2008 South Ossetia
War and again in 2015 when Sandworm, a hacking group linked with Russian
intelligence, [took down Ukraine's power grid.]{.underline}

[Russian]{.underline} state-sponsored [cyber attacks]{.underline}
targeting Ukraine [can devastate U.S. and NATO networks]{.underline}.
The 2017 Notpetya and WannaCry attacks spread throughout the world soon
after hitting their targets. In the 2020 Solar Winds hack, cyber
criminals directed by Russian intelligence inserted malicious code into
updates in Orion software that infected servers used by the U.S.
Treasury, Energy, and Defense Departments, as well as Microsoft, Intel,
and Cisco. The [U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency]{.underline} recently [warned U.S. networks are vulnerable to
more Russian cyber attacks.]{.underline}

[Russia]{.underline} also [uses blended cyber operations]{.underline},
in which governments tolerate cyber criminals and ransomware groups
operating in their countries. For example, the 2021 cyber attacks
against Colonial Pipeline, which controls much of the fuel along the
U.S. East Coast, were launched by criminal group Darkside operating in
Russia. Darkside locked up Colonial Pipeline's networks and held data
hostage until it paid a ransom of \$5 million.

Steps NATO Should Take

Information warfare and cyber attacks demonstrate that [NATO must get
serious about building resilience against hybrid]{.underline} war
[tactics]{.underline}. This means [prioritizing counter-hybrid measures
in NATO's next Strategic Concept]{.underline}, which will be developed
in June. [NATO should]{.underline} take the following steps to [counter
Russian information operations]{.underline}:

1.  [NATO's next Strategic Concept should update Article V]{.underline}
    of the North Atlantic Charter, which commits NATO members to defend
    one another, [to include hybrid war tactics]{.underline} in addition
    to conventional military actions. While the range of gray-zone
    operations makes it difficult to know when and how to trigger the
    collective defense mechanism, [NATO members should engage in
    deterrence in the contemporary battlespace.]{.underline}

2.  [NATO must establish]{.underline} a network of [innovation centers
    to expand on]{.underline} its [existing centers]{.underline} of
    excellence. NATO developed the Strategic Communications Centre of
    Excellence [in Latvia]{.underline} to identify disinformation
    [and]{.underline} the Cooperative Cyber Center of Excellence in
    [Estonia]{.underline} to monitor cyber operations. NATO also
    approved the NATO-Industry Cyber Partnership to improve the
    alliance's relationship with private firms and coordinate cyber
    defense efforts.

3.  [New NATO innovation centers could engage in cutting-edge research
    and development on artificial intelligence, quantum computing,
    autonomous machines, hypersonic technologies, and information and
    technology literacy]{.underline}. Innovation centers could be
    modeled on the European Union's East Stratcom Task Force, which is
    staffed with experts specializing in Russian propaganda through its
    EUDisinfo site. Innovation centers funded through NATO's Science for
    Peace and Security program could partner with NATO's Joint
    Intelligence and Security Division (JISD).These [centers
    could]{.underline} also [develop public-private partnerships
    with]{.underline} commercial [firms, academic institutions, and
    civil society groups to build resilience]{.underline} through
    training centers, research institutes, and information technology
    programming.

4.  [Governance and rule of law among alliance members must be improved
    as weak institutions provide maligned]{.underline} external [actors
    avenues to interfere]{.underline}. For example, while [an innovation
    center]{.underline} can improve North Macedonia's ability to combat
    disinformation and cyberattacks, it [must]{.underline} also [improve
    domestic governance, combat corruption, strengthen judicial
    practices, and enhance economic opportunities]{.underline}.
    President Biden's executive actions targeting corruption in the
    Western Balkans is a significant step to promote accountability.

The [most effective way to defend against]{.underline} Russian [hybrid
tactics is]{.underline} for NATO [to partner with the private
sector]{.underline} and academia [to lead research and development
initiatives that can boost alliance-wide]{.underline} emerging and
disruptive [technologies policies]{.underline}. Since [many
security-related applications]{.underline} of emerging and disruptive
technologies [are derived from private firms, partnering with
companies]{.underline}, start-ups, and universities and research
institutes [is essential to securing alliance members]{.underline} in
the 21st Century. [NATO should invest in strengthening capacity and
innovation against hybrid attacks]{.underline} as much as it invests in
conventional military hardware.

#### Cooperating with NATO via a central, coordinating counterinformation center successfully prevents Russia's disinformation campaign.

Recommendations

[The United States needs to address hostile information
activities]{.underline} from its adversaries [more
efectively]{.underline}. As observed in the recent hacking scandals
surrounding the US presidential election in which Russia targeted and,
[according to the US intelligence community]{.underline}, used
information to disrupt and ultimately help its candidate of choice to
win, [the]{.underline} soft [power most effective in confounding the
United States is information itself, and not]{.underline} necessarily
[any]{.underline} production or dissemination
[technology]{.underline}.65 Given the fact that Russia spends
approximately \$400--\$500 million per year on foreign information
efforts, while the US spends \$20 million USD on Russian language
services, it is easy to see that the United States is far behind.66 Some
[recommendations]{.underline} to address this shortcoming
[include]{.underline}:

National counterinformation strategy and center. [The United States'
offensive cybercapability is]{.underline} generally [considered among
the most sophisticated and powerful on the planet]{.underline}; however,
as observed in efforts against the Islamic State, [America has been less
adept in countering online messaging]{.underline} despite substantial
resources.67

In late December 2016, President Barack [Obama authorized \$611 billion
for the military]{.underline} in 2017 and to establish a Global
Engagement Center [to track foreign propaganda and
disinformation]{.underline} efforts [undermining]{.underline} US
[national security]{.underline} interests.68 Little information on the
development of this entity is available to date, although a similarly
named center focusing on Islamic State messaging is headquartered [in
the State Department. Such a center should serve as a central,
coordinating entity]{.underline} as well as model the operations of the
National Counterterrorism Center, which maintains cross-government
civilian and military representation and directly advises the Director
of National Intelligence. Furthermore, [this center needs to collaborate
with national security stakeholders to develop unique strategies for
each state and nonstate actor.]{.underline}

Protect against fake news. The [rampant proliferation of fake
news]{.underline}, such as observed during the US elections and
annexation of Crimea, undoubtedly [plays a pivotal role in Russian
information operations]{.underline}.69 One [initiative to]{.underline}
help [reduce fake news involves leveraging cutting-edge technology
to]{.underline} help [identify]{.underline} the
[fabrications]{.underline} as soon as they emerge.
[A]{.underline}rtificial [i]{.underline}ntelligence [and]{.underline}
[data analytics can be used to detect]{.underline} words or word
patterns that might indicate [deceitful stories]{.underline}. In
addition, the US government via the Department of Homeland Security
should implement a strategy for educating the public as well as
identifying and reporting fake news outlets in much the same way
cyberscams are reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

International engagement. [The global nature of the Internet
provides]{.underline} many [outlets for disseminating legitimate and
illegitimate information]{.underline}. [A myriad of social
media]{.underline} platforms [can]{.underline} also [be used to promote
slanted news]{.underline} stories and propaganda [via Internet trolls.
Increasing international collaboration among]{.underline} law
enforcement and [intelligence professionals who]{.underline}
specifically [focus on]{.underline} these outlets [will help agencies
identify and disable these sources]{.underline}.

Conclusions

[Applying information warfare theories in today's]{.underline}
geopolitical [climate remains a work in progress]{.underline}. An
around-the-clock news cycle and the various ways of disseminating and
consuming information worldwide make implementing information-based
operations and tailoring messaging against competing narratives
challenges. As observed in Georgia, smaller nations can competitively
control information and influence target audiences to at least mitigate
the efforts of, if not defeat, larger nations.

Even after learning from its missteps in Georgia, Russia, did not gain
many Ukrainian regions. Russia lost opportunities in Luhansk and Donetsk
when Russian troops were unable to penetrate the regions promptly.
[Russia]{.underline}, however, [appears to be]{.underline} guided by
Gerasimov's principle of [refining information confrontation strategies
by continuing]{.underline} to engage in [various forms of official and
unofficial messaging]{.underline} as well as [perfecting the
art]{.underline}.

One scholar of Russian propaganda refers to it as less of an information
war as much as a war on information. Given the value Russia places on
manipulating information, [perceptions of the information space
as]{.underline} potentially [dangerous]{.underline} and a successful
agent for ousting governments and influencing public opinion and
behavior [are understandable]{.underline}. A [former KGB general stated
the overall goal of]{.underline} Soviet Union propaganda was not far
from the "subversion" pursued by [Russia's modern]{.underline} Internet
[disinformation campaign: "active measures to weaken the West, to drive
wedges in]{.underline} the [Western]{.underline} community
[alliances]{.underline} of all sorts, [particularly NATO, to sow discord
among allies, to weaken the United States]{.underline} in the eyes of
the people in Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, [and]{.underline}
thus [to prepare ground in case the war really occurs]{.underline}."

While the media has focused on offensive cyberattacks and disruptive
efforts to cripple critical infrastructures and to impede public access
to financial institutions and emergency services, [Russia understands
the potential power]{.underline} associated with [influencing via
cyberspace]{.underline}. As such, [Russia continues to refine
its]{.underline} online [information operations]{.underline} against
regional and international targets, [outpacing the United States in
nonoffensive cybercapabilities]{.underline} and demonstrating not all
threats in cyberspace are written in binary.

[Russia]{.underline} "[is waging the most amazing information-warfare
blitzkrieg in the history of]{.underline} [information
warfare]{.underline}," Gen. Philip [Breedlove told NATO]{.underline}
leaders at their 2014 summit. [There's no evidence that Moscow's efforts
have]{.underline} since [slackened]{.underline}---[nor]{.underline} that
[the United States is institutionally equipped to develop an effective
response]{.underline}.

This was not always the case. During and just after the Cold War, the
U.S. more than held its own in the sphere of information operations. And
though the internet --- and particularly social media --- have greatly
increased the speed and scale (and decreased the cost) of such
operations, the experience of those years suggests a way to build and
run an IO organization to lead them successfully.

From 1953 until 1999, [the deployment and use of the nation's
information-warfare "instruments of power" were]{.underline} led and
[coordinated by the]{.underline} United States Information Agency, or
[USIA]{.underline}. The agency was created by President Eisenhower, a
military veteran who understood the power of information and alarmed by
the activities of the "psychological strategists of Communism." Among
other areas, [USIA was created to lead America's efforts in the field of
public diplomacy]{.underline} --- [the effort to influence foreign
audiences]{.underline} through messaging and organizations such as
[Voice of America]{.underline}. (Its creation was advocated by Secretary
of State John Foster Dulles, who wanted his own organization to
concentrate on traditional diplomacy.) [USIA's strategic communication
and counter-propaganda efforts helped shore up Western
resolve]{.underline} while exploiting cracks between Warsaw Pact
governments and their populations.

Even after the Berlin Wall fell, [USIA ably equipped policy-makers with
international public opinion atmospherics, aided in countering extensive
Iraqi misinformation campaigns, and managed messaging to media outlets
during]{.underline} 1990-91's [Desert Storm and Desert
Shield]{.underline}. During the Clinton administration, [USIA again
played a key role in consolidating and pushing strategic messaging to
foreign media outlets and audiences]{.underline} in reaction to a 1993
agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization,
[galvanizing world opinion in support of the U.S. government's role as a
peace broker]{.underline} and pushing for continued progress. And as the
1995 Dayton Peace Agreement began to send U.S. military forces into and
around Bosnia, [USIA's public-opinion polls]{.underline} in the region
[helped U.S. government leaders and organizations make policy
decisions]{.underline}.

But [desires to streamline the]{.underline} post-Cold War government
[bureaucracy]{.underline}, [coupled with State's desire to engulf the
agency]{.underline} and its budget, [made USIA an easy
target]{.underline}. In 1999, [[it was folded into the State
Department]{.underline}]{.mark}. As its advocates feared, a clash of
cultures and the weighted importance of traditional diplomacy pushed
public diplomacy to the backseat.

Within just a few years, the consequences of an absent information arm
made themselves apparent. [The 2003 Iraq invasion became known for its
IO missteps]{.underline} --- among them ["Mission Accomplished" and
"coalition of the willing."]{.underline} The problems were compounded by
general U.S. policy-maker naiveté toward Middle Eastern and global
public opinion on U.S. military actions. [A year later, the 9/11
Commission Report highlighted the deterioration of the informational
instruments of power, noting the monopoly enjoyed by al
Qaeda]{.underline} in the domain of Middle Eastern public opinion.

Skip forward to 2015, when former Director of [National
Intelligence]{.underline} James Clapper is [telling the Senate Armed
Services Committee]{.underline} that [the U.S. government
needs]{.underline} "[a]{.underline} much [more robust capability from
the standpoint of the resource commitment to
counter-messaging]{.underline}." His proposed [solution?]{.underline}
[A]{.underline} "U.S. Information Agency ([USIA]{.underline}) [on
steroids]{.underline}."

[Congress responded by establishing the Global Engagement
Center]{.underline}, an interagency office [[housed at the Department of
State]{.underline}]{.mark} "[to coordinate and synchronize
counter-propaganda efforts]{.underline}." [Lawmakers allocated the new
center \$120 million]{.underline} to start up in fiscal 2017, [but the
Trump administration spent none of it]{.underline}. [The GEC was to
receive \$60 million in fiscal 2018, but as of March had neither the
funds nor enough staff to do its job]{.underline}.

[Other parts of the U.S. government still do messaging, spending about
\$730 million annually]{.underline} on a wide range of international
media operations. [That is "a small fraction of what our adversaries are
spendin]{.underline}g," according to the chairman of the Broadcasting
Board of Governors, which supervises Voice of America, Radio Free
Europe, and other government broadcasters. Writes one independent
security researcher, "[The State Department estimates that the
Kremlin\'s sophisticated influence campaign effort includes a \$1.4
billion-a-year internal and external propaganda apparatus, claiming to
reach some six hundred million people in 130 countries and 30
languages]{.underline}."

[The USIA's key contributions during an earlier period of competition
underline the need for a concerted, interagency approach to strategic
information operations]{.underline}. Among the [requirements is a direct
link between policy-makers and the informational instruments of
power]{.underline}. [Its funding problems aside, the GEC is simply too
peripheral]{.underline}.

What is needed is a new organization --- call it [the Office of
Strategic Narratives]{.underline} --- and [the right institutional
placement]{.underline}. [It should be located within the National
Security Council]{.underline}, [under the existing Deputy National
Security Advisor for Strategic Communications]{.underline}. [This will
give it a direct line to the president and equal footing with the
departments that run the various U.S. messaging programs]{.underline}.
[This new office should include representatives from across the
government, and purview over the GEC and the BBG]{.underline}.

[The OSN would have responsibility for developing
narratives]{.underline} and counter-narratives [on issues of national
importance for U.S. communications]{.underline}, [based on bottom-up
interagency reporting]{.underline} from across the information
environment [and guidance from the president via the National Security
Advisor]{.underline}. [Its roles would include leading the informational
instruments of power, gauging public opinions, countering]{.underline}
mis/[disinformation]{.underline}, monitoring [and reporting on the
effects of adversarial messaging, monitoring the IE as a whole, and
disseminating presidential policies and messages]{.underline}. As part
of all this, [it would coordinate with the DOD's PSYOP and Public
Affairs service members nesting of messaging efforts under accepted
national strategic narratives]{.underline} --- not unlike how some
Combatant Commands operate. As well, [the new office might eventually
work with NATO]{.underline} partner-equivalent offices [to share the
costs and burdens in identifying and countering Russian]{.underline}
mis- and [disinformation.]{.underline}

Importantly, [the OSN should be established by executive order, which
would head off efforts by more senior agencies to protect their
parochial interests by not relinquishing control of assets and
budgets]{.underline}.

[The importance of the information environment has never
been]{.underline} more [greater]{.underline} --- [nor the need to move
beyond today's half-measures and establish a strong]{.underline} and
central [organization to coordinate America's messaging,
counter-messaging, and instruments of informational power]{.underline}.
[Establishing an Office of Strategic Narratives]{.underline} in the
National Security Council [offers the chance to duplicate]{.underline},
or even exceed, [the effectiveness of the Cold War's USIA.]{.underline}

Justin **Ling 22**, journalist for VICE News, has written in Medium, The
Guardian, Business Insider, MSN Canada, The Independent, and Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation, 5/13/2022, \"NATO Should Elevate Its Cyber
Game, and Quickly,\" Centre for International Governance Innovation,
https://www.cigionline.org/articles/nato-should-elevate-its-cyber-game-and-quickly/

When Moscow attacked Ukraine in February, President Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline} expected a quick victory.

Not only did the Kremlin have military superiority, but it [planned a
concerted]{.underline} cyber and [information campaign to disrupt the
Ukrainian state, galvanize support among Russophones, weaken Western
resolve and convince Ukrainians that resistance is futile]{.underline}.

Much like its resistance in the streets and on the battlefield, Ukraine
has put up a remarkable defence against Moscow's unconventional warfare.

"I believe that this war has been going on, not since February 24, but
since the beginning of 2014, when Russia first attacked us," Mykhailo
Fedorov, Ukraine's forward-looking vice prime minister and minister of
digital transformation, the man behind President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's
2019 win, told me in April from a location near Kyiv. "And as such, we
have had eight years to reform."

But while Federov may have helped prepare Ukraine for this moment,
[Russia's relentless efforts to destroy his country]{.underline} --- and
its evident resolve --- [mean the country needs further defences. Kyiv
requires help]{.underline} that [Western allied
governments]{.underline}, including Canada, [are in a position to
provide]{.underline}.

The Kremlin's Global Disinformation Network

[Russia's]{.underline} propaganda and [disinformation apparatus is
extraordinarily complex. Some]{.underline} outlets [are]{.underline}
fully [state-run, some are]{.underline} merely [state-funded, and others
are operated]{.underline} at arm's length [by Putin-linked oligarchs.
The system churns out conspiracy theories and whataboutism to aid
Moscow]{.underline}'s objectives.

From the start of the all-out invasion on February 24, [Russian
disinfo]{.underline}rmation [has thumped on a series of narratives:
that]{.underline} the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [(NATO) posed a
security risk to]{.underline} the [Russia]{.underline}n Federation;
[that Ukraine was run by neo-Nazis; that Ukraine is responsible for
slaughtering civilians]{.underline} on its own territory.

[Those narratives have]{.underline}, unfortunately, [been]{.underline}
somewhat [effective in discouraging a unified response from NATO.
They've influenced millions of Westerners]{.underline} and found
purchase with far-right and Russophilic politicians the world over.

The most visible Western response to date has been the collective taking
offline of Russia Today, or RT, the state-run television network.

Yet trying to ban Russian media is a mug's game. Any outlets forbidden
by law or suspended by the social media giants would simply jump to the
Russian-founded social media platform Telegram, which abhors regulation.

[Rather than playing whack-a-mole]{.underline} outlet by outlet,
[Ukraine's allies would be better off exposing how these disinformation
networks work]{.underline}.

Many of these social media pages, self-styled think tanks, blogs and
media outlets are designed to look fully independent and authentic.
Efforts by Twitter, Alphabet and Meta to expose them as disinformation
have been inconsistent.

Berlin-based, Moscow-run video aggregator Ruptly is "state-affiliated
media," according to Twitter, but "state-controlled media" per Facebook;
its"transparency" feature notes that the outlet's page administrators
are in three EU countries, but doesn't name them.

Some smaller but perhaps more effective outlets --- such as the
French-language Donbass Insider, which has used manipulative practices
to spread Kremlin disinformation on its Facebook page --- carry no
disclaimer at all.

Plenty can be done to identify and expose who runs these propaganda
outlets. Western intelligence can help shed light on how they interact
and fit in with Russian intelligence efforts. But social media companies
also need to deny their advertising services to these state-controlled
outlets.

"What's the currency of disinformation?" Marko Suprun, a Kyiv-based host
and producer, asked me recently. "AdSense."

Google's advertising platform will hardly make any disinformation agent
rich. But Suprun says it has created "a bit of a cottage industry ---
they make enough money to survive."

If the companies drag their feet --- in particular, those companies that
have suspended operations in Russia but haven't closed up shop entirely
--- moving to publicly shame them could be quite effective, as Kyiv has
shown.

"What we're trying to emphasize is that there are no grey areas here,"
Fedorov told me. "This is basically as good-versus-evil as it gets. So,
you either choose the path of good, and you stop operations in Russia
and you help fight disinformation. Or you choose the path of evil and
you stay in Russia and you pay taxes, which can, potentially, be used to
fund the army that's murdering civilians."

Why Have a Cyber Command if You're Not Going to Use It?

When the Islamic State used its al-Hayat Media Center to recruit
Westerners to its cause, a US-based coalition bombed the group's
propaganda hubs and hacked its websites. [Launching
airstrikes]{.underline} in Moscow [is obviously not an option. But that
doesn't mean NATO can't take]{.underline} these [stations
offline]{.underline}. After all, Russian disinformation and hacking have
targeted democratic systems and added fuel to extremist movements in the
West.

Ukraine has already taken the fight to Russia's doorstep. Aggressive
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaigns have knocked offline
various elements of the Russian state. A well-trained "IT Army," as
Fedorov dubs it, has hacked major state companies and dumped the
personal information of their employees and operations.

[For years, NATO has been skittish about deploying its newly beefed-up
cyber capacities]{.underline}, treating such powers as akin to missile
strikes or active warfare. Ahead of NATO's upcoming June summit, [there
are calls to come up with a more flexible policy on cyber
operations]{.underline}. [Giving member countries the freedom to target
infrastructure used for]{.underline} malicious cyber or [disinformation
activity would be a great place to start]{.underline}.

In effect, [NATO]{.underline} countries [should have the flexibility to
degrade Russia's ability to launch information]{.underline} and cyber
[operations against]{.underline} Ukraine and [the West]{.underline}.
That doesn't mean launching an operation that could be considered an act
of war, such as knocking a power plant offline (something Russia has
done both to the United States and Ukraine). [It could
mean]{.underline}, however, [launching DDoS attacks on Russian websites,
or attempting to spearphish access to a Telegram channel]{.underline}
linked to the Wagner Group, a quasi-private military contractor. Those
operations would be both proportionate and plausibly deniable.

The West also needs to help Kyiv continue its fight."We, of course, need
communications equipment, mostly satellite equipment --- including, but
not limited to, Starlink terminals," Fedorov told me. "So that we can
basically ensure connectivity whenever we can." And, he says, although
Ukraine has already been given a significant number of workstations,
laptops and tablets, it needs still more.

Not all Kremlin support originates in Russia.

As a 2020 report from the US Department of State notes, an incredibly
useful hub for Russian disinformation is the Canada-based "Centre for
Research on Globalization." The website, the report notes, boasts a
"large roster of fringe authors and conspiracy theorists \[that\] serves
as a talent pool for Russian and Chinese websites."

Conspiracy theories that pop up on sites like these --- such as the
notion that Moscow is striking Ukraine to destroy US-funded biolabs
similar to the equally fictional ones that other conspiracists claim
gave us COVID-19 --- have been adopted wholesale by Moscow.

Western intelligence agencies are aware, or should be aware, of the
level of involvement these hubs have with the Russian state. That State
Department [report is a great first step toward declassifying far more
intelligence]{.underline} than is currently done. [Washington and London
have started along that path, but all NATO members should
engage]{.underline} --- [in]{.underline} both [countering falsehoods and

7.5 [Four Lines of Defense]{.underline}

Currently, there appear to be four basic "lines of defense" [when
countering hostile info]{.underline}rmation
[op]{.underline}eration[s.]{.underline}

1\. [Documenting]{.underline} the [threat]{.underline}, in order to
[collect more data on]{.underline} the [threat and gain]{.underline} a
[stronger understanding of]{.underline} the [threat in]{.underline} the
[info]{.underline}rmation [environment.]{.underline}

2\. [Raising awareness about the threat]{.underline} to
[broaden]{.underline} the [audiences]{.underline} that are
[aware]{.underline} of it [and]{.underline}, thus, are [inoculated
against it]{.underline}. In contrast to the first line, which seeks to
obtain more information about the threat, the second line attempts to
[ensure]{.underline} that [more people have at least basic
info]{.underline}rmation about the threat.

3\. [Repairing, mitigating, and preventing weaknesses found within the
information system]{.underline}, in order to [decrease]{.underline} the
[ease of exploitation for attackers]{.underline} and to
[make]{.underline} their [target smaller and harder to hit.]{.underline}
This [line of defense should mitigate effect of the threat]{.underline}
on the target.

4\. [Limiting, challenging, constraining, punishing and deterring
information aggressors]{.underline}. This line of defense, unlike those
prior, is not directed at the victims of information aggression, but
[aims to decrease the aggressors' desire to be aggressive]{.underline}
instead.

[Within each]{.underline} of these lines of [defense contain various
tactical countermeasures]{.underline} that [can be
undertaken.]{.underline} To [underline the caveat]{.underline} above,
[none of these measures will solve one hundred per cent]{.underline} of
the problem. [However,]{.underline} this does not mean that the given
measure is necessarily useless---it merely [means]{.underline} that we
need to be [applying more such measures,]{.underline} [which constantly
adapt and evolve with the changing infor- mation environment and
aggressors. It is critical to act and adapt to
disinformation]{.underline}, [providing space to develop lessons learned
from efforts to counter disinformation versus searching for ideal
counter measures which can be unattainable]{.underline}. The subse-
quent section will discuss the tactical countermeasures relevant to each
line of defense one by one.

#### Documentation is an [imperative]{.underline} otherwise we're [fighting in a fog]{.underline}.

7.5.1 Line 1: Documenting the Threat

[Documentation is the imperative first step without]{.underline} which
almost [nothing else is possible]{.underline}; and at the same time,
still a [measure]{.underline} that is [gravely
underestimated]{.underline}. It is [necessary to document]{.underline}:
[the channels involved]{.underline} in spreading disinformation, [the
disinformation narratives themselves]{.underline} and how they change
with time, [how such information travels]{.underline} from one medium
(e.g., language, platform, "filter bubble", etc.) to another, [the
actors involved in proliferating them]{.underline} (both knowingly or
not), [and the effect that such disinformation has]{.underline} on given
audiences. While this task may sound relatively straightforward,
unfortunately, to date, [this task]{.underline} has not, and [is
currently not, being dealt with properly]{.underline}. [There are still
many questions that we do not have answers to,]{.underline} which means
that [we are fighting in a fog, not knowing what we are standing up
against.]{.underline}

The pioneer of systematic, day-to-day documentation of disinformation in
the twenty-first century is the Ukrainian project StopFake.7 This
project started right after the Anschluss of Crimea by the Russian Armed
Forces, and centers on exposing and refuting Russian disinformation
campaigns abroad. The project's focus is specifically on disinformation
campaigns targeting Ukraine, but StopFake has also debunked
disinformation surrounding other countries or individuals.

The [process of debunking may sometimes be quickly dismissed as too
laborious]{.underline}, [or as a "whack-a-mole" approach.]{.underline}
There is also an incorrect, though unfortunately relatively popular,
myth that debunking strengthens, rather than weakens, disinfor- mation
efforts (Global Engagement Center, 2020c; Swire-Thompson et al., 2020).
However, [in order to be able to label a piece of information as
disinformation]{.underline}, [it is necessary to fact-check the given
story and to identify whether and where, if at all, the piece distorts
realit]{.underline}y[,]{.underline} i.e., refute the disinformation
piece, debunk it. [There is no other way to identify
disinformation]{.underline}. [Without the process of debunking, it is
not even possible to have a conversation about
disinformation]{.underline}, [let alone to appro- priately document
instances of disinformation]{.underline}. [Without the documentation of
cases of disinformation, there are no facts on which a decision or
future learning may be based.]{.underline}

[Documenting]{.underline} disinformation, [no matter how underestimated
or dismissed]{.underline}, [is the imperative]{.underline} first step
towards countering disinformation, without which nothing else could be
done in an informed and verifiable manner. It is no coincidence that
much of the misunderstanding and underestimation of disinformation
campaigns and how to counter them comes from individuals and
organizations who have never undergone this critical first step. It is
also [not unusual that those experienced with the vast disin- formation
ecosystem]{.underline} often have to point out that their respective
[societies continue to underestimate the scope of Kremlin
disinformation]{.underline} and propaganda.8

StopFake's approach to countering disinformation has been emulated
around the world. After the Kremlin's Anschluss of Crimea and the
renewed Russian information aggression that followed, NATO has created a
factsheet called "Setting the Record Straight" (NATO, 2020), which
debunks some of the most notorious disinformation narratives spread by
the Kremlin and its disinformation ecosystem. Since 2015, the EU's
counter-disinformation unit, the East StratCom Task Force (EEAS, 2021),
has been publishing its "Disinformation Review", a project that
documents pro- Kremlin disinformation,9 and has since evolved into the
EUvsDisinfo campaign. As of April 2021, the Task Force collected over
11,000 cases of disinformation, which are presented within a searchable
database10---so far, the only such database of its kind in the world.

However, the work of EUvsDisinfo also indirectly shows us how much we
are missing. As of spring 2021, Brussels has not replicated this model
beyond addressing pro-Kremlin disinformation campaigns. There is no such
project, for example, that documents disinformation originating in
China.11 Rather, the coverage of Chinese Communist Party disseminated
disinformation seems to be based on the work of non- EU researchers and
journalists, as opposed to the EU's own data set (EUvsDisinfo, 2020b).
Similarly, hard data about disinformation campaigns such as that of
ISIS, or other so-called domestic actors, are not provided by the EU.

The refuting and documenting of disinformation is also done by think
tanks, NGOs and civic activists. The Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic
Research Lab focuses on "identifying, exposing and explaining
disinformation using open source research"12 and in 2021, the team
presented a report on COVID-related disinfor- mation (DFRLab, 2021). The
Prague-based European Values Center for Security Policy (European
Values) exposes "Russian influence and disinformation operations focused
against Western democracies."13 The Lithuanian "Elves"14 kick-started
their counter-trolling efforts following the Russian invasion of
Ukraine. Through their cooperation with established media and
information technology and artificial intel- ligence (AI) experts, a
unique system dubbed Debunk.eu has been built (Global Engagement Center,
2020a). Debunk.eu combines an algorithm which identifies potential
disinformation stories with robust manpower to verify the information
pinpointed by the algorithm, i.e., fact-checking and setting the record
straight (Delfi, 2020). The Czech company Semantic Visions also uses AI
to monitor the spread of disinformation stories (Semantic Visions,
2020).

The Czech version of the "Elves"15 are documenting what is happening
across disinformation-oriented outlets, and also across non-public
channels that spread disinformation, including chain emails (which are
still popular among the elderly population in the region; EUvsDisinfo,
2017a). Researchers in Ukraine have docu- mented the rise of pro-Kremlin
disinformation that has penetrated some of the country's most popular
Telegram channels (Velychko, 2020). Infiltrating such groups that use
closed channels of information is probably best done by actors within
civil society, rather than by formal institutions (governments and other
such organizations would be susceptible to accusations of "Big
Brother"-like espionage). Apart from the work undergone by the public
sphere, there are also institution- and government- level efforts
underway (Pogrund, 2020). This work, though sometimes very high in
quality, may be limited in impact if the work remains non-public.

[Even though there are already a few initiatives working on documenting
and refuting disinformation,]{.underline} [there are still many crucial
questions that remain unanswered]{.underline}. For example:

• How many disinformation channels are there? Is their number increasing
or decreasing? How many new channels have appeared in the last
week/month/year?

• How many messages do these channels spread on a daily/weekly/monthly
basis?

• How many people do these messages target and reach?16

• How many people believe the messages of each given disinformation
campaign?

(because, hypothetically, [the decreasing numbers of the disinformation
narratives or channels does not necessarily mean that the campaign would
be less successful]{.underline}, it can [just mean it is evolving into a
more effective stage, doing the same job with less
resources]{.underline})

[Without answers to these questions, we remain fighting in a
fog.]{.underline} [We are in a situation akin to a country that has been
attacked by an outside aggressor but does not have even the remotest of
ideas about how many soldiers, tanks, jets or missiles the enemy
has]{.underline} in their arsenal, or even how many people per day they
succeed in killing.

In addition to this, [without having the answers to these
questions]{.underline}, we [cannot address other crucial
questions]{.underline}. Following every major incident that the Kremlin
has lied about, many researchers and civil servants receive the same
question: Has there been an increase in disinformation? The issue here
is that, [if we are not properly measuring the extent to which
disinformation is present during the uneventful, or "calm", periods, we
cannot begin to address a potential increase, or lack thereof, following
major events, or "hot" periods. We do not know what the baseline is and,
therefore, we cannot talk about deviations from the
baseline]{.underline}, empirically speaking at least. We [cannot answer
questions about the potential success]{.underline}, [or lack
thereof]{.underline}, [of various disinformation campaigns]{.underline},
either, [if we do not have empirically certain data about
them]{.underline}. Essentially, [there is an unknown, but powerful,
force influencing our audiences]{.underline}, [and we cannot say how big
or how dangerous it actually is.]{.underline}

We are in a situation in which [we see but the proverbial tip of the
iceberg]{.underline}, without having a clue as to whether we are aware
of ten or only one per cent of the problem. [We need to be designing
various solutions to address one hundred per cent of the
problem.]{.underline} [Finding any missing information as soon as
possible should be the imper- ative.]{.underline} Governments should be
taking the lead or, at the very least, be providing the necessary
funding for relevant third-party actors, as many civil society
organizations do not have sufficient resources for adequate monitoring.

Aside from trying to document disinformation campaigns as exhaustively
as possible, [we also need to document the success, or lack thereof, of
each given campaign,]{.underline} while answering the following
question: "How many people believe each disinformation message?"
Unfortunately, the work that is being done to address this question is
quite sporadic and less systematic than required.

The question surrounding the impact of disinformation campaigns is one
of the most difficult in the field. Disinformation expert Ben Nimmo, the
head of Global Threat Intelligence Strategy at Facebook, has developed a
model based on whether information remains on one platform, or travels
across multiple, and whether this information similarly remains in one
community, or spreads across many (Nimmo, 2020). Other researchers have
measured the engagement rate of specific disinfor- mation narratives on
social media, often concluding that disinformation frequently beats true
information in this respect (Dizikes, 2018; RFE/RL, 2020a).

Another option is to [measure how many people believe a particular
disinforma- tion campaign via opinion polls]{.underline}---because it is
[highly probable]{.underline} that the [info]{.underline}rmation
aggressors are [more interested in turning peoples' hearts and
minds]{.underline}, rather [than in engagement numbers]{.underline} on
social media. This method is more precise in the cases where we know
that a particular message would never be in the information space if it
had not been introduced by various information aggressors, such as the
pro-Kremlin disinformation campaign surrounding the crash of flight
MH17, or the poisonings of Litvinenko, Skripal and Navalny. In instances
where a particular disinformation campaign builds upon pre-existing
conditions, such as low trust in authorities or fear of various
socio-economic groups, it is hard to distinguish between the impact, or
lack thereof, of the campaign itself, as opposed to other factors. That
being said, this can still provide valuable data to consider for policy
makers or opinion leaders dealing with the information space.17

A cause for concern is the tendency for significant numbers of the
population in several European countries to fall for disinformation
narratives (Shutov, 2020). For example, even in a country like Ukraine,
where the level of awareness about the Kremlin's disinformation
campaigns is very high, there remains a significant part of the
population that believes disinformation narratives that would not appear
within the information space if not for the pro-Kremlin disinformation
ecosystem (EUvsDisinfo, 2017b). Unfortunately, at present, there are no
individual actors or organizations, public or private that are
conducting regular opinion polls on the subject.18

[As of yet, we do not have consistent, reliable, and replicable
information about the potential successes of these disinformation
campaigns. Not only does this mean that we are uncertain as to how big
the threat is that we face, we also cannot reliably measure whether our
countermeasures work]{.underline} (i.e., whether the number of people
believing various disinformation narratives have decreased).

[Documenting the threat of disinformation may seem like a measure that
is critical only after a given event or campaign has occurred but, in
fact, this measure can be of use even during an ongoing disinformation
campaign.]{.underline} Following the poisonings of Sergei and Yulia
Skripal by Russian secret service agents, the British govern- ment
documented and exposed the various conflicting, constantly changing
narra- tives spread by the Kremlin as they appeared (Dettmer, 2018). In
so doing, the British government was swift and consistent in its
response to the disinformation, and the conflicting messages and lies
spread by the pro-Kremlin disinformation ecosystem were exposed
(EUvsDisinfo, 2018b). A simple timeline of the various messages spread
by Kremlin's propaganda bullhorns made it obvious as to the deception at
play.19

#### Raising awareness is paramount. Civilian awareness substantially hinders misinformation campaigns effectiveness.

7.5.2 Line 2: Raising Awareness About the Threat

Documenting the threat is the first step to countering systematic
disinformation campaigns, and the [raising of awareness afterwards, by
making use of the data collected, is the natural continuation of this
first step.]{.underline} Projects such as the DFRLab (Atlantic Council),
EUvsDisinfo (EU), and Kremlin Watch (European Values) are not only
documenting cases of disinformation, but are also publishing relevant
arti- cles and reports, as well as providing training and briefings for
governments, media, and the academic community. However, there is a
limit to these organizations' reach. Irrespective of whether the actor
is governmental or non-governmental, neither can reach nor persuade an
audience in full---they each have a limited target audience. It is
necessary not only to collect more data about disinformation campaigns
and to educate one's own audience about the threat, but also to
constantly broaden the audience that receives that message.

In addition to the organizations mentioned above, the Swedish Civil
Contingencies Agency (MSB) created a handbook for civil service
communicators intended to help them counter information influence
activities (MSB, 2019). A similar effort was initiated by the UK
government (UK Government, 2019). The MSB and the Security Service Säpo
have also been briefing politicians and media in Sweden (EUvsDisinfo,
2018c). The Czech Center for Countering Terrorism and Hybrid Threats is
also focusing on educating the country's civil service about hybrid
threats, including disinformation (Ministerstvo vnitra Cˇ R, 2016). In
some countries, it is the secret services that provide excellent
information on the threat, and their materials are highly valued by the
expert community and the media---see e.g., the annual reports of the
Estonian KAPO,20 or the Lithuanian National Threat Assessment.21

The [NATO StratCom]{.underline} Centre of Excellence ([CoE]{.underline})
in Riga publishes reports on the topic of disinformation and strategic
communication.22 They also [organize confer- ences targeted at civil
servants and experts dealing with the topi]{.underline}c. The [CoE also
provides briefings and training for governments in NATO's member
countries.]{.underline} The joint EU-NATO Hybrid CoE in Helsinki is
working in a similar manner.23

[Ideally, increasing awareness on a given disinformation campaign or
narrative may help to mitigate or dispel a false story before it has
time to spread]{.underline}. A [compar- ison between the infamous "Lisa
case"]{.underline} in Germany [with its Lithuanian counterpart
demonstrates]{.underline} the [difference between how a disinformation
campaign plays out in a country aware of the threat]{.underline}, versus
in a country where this awareness is not very high. The Lisa case took
place in Germany in January 2016 (Meister, 2016). A 13- year-old girl
from a Russian-speaking family, upon not making it home in time for her
curfew, told her parents that she had been raped as an excuse. While she
later admitted that the story was false, and the German authorities
confirmed this, pro- Kremlin media and activists in Germany ignored this
and continued to spread only the original falsehood. This resulted in
demonstrations and a public denunciation by Russian Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov of the German authorities, accusing them of a cover-up
(McGuiness, 2016).

By contrast, a year later, a similar fake story in which an underage
girl was allegedly raped appeared in Lithuania, failed completely
(Schultz, 2017). This was in [large part due to the Lithuanian Armed
Forces' StratCom team's preparation of the country's civil servants and
local authorities for such attacks, which had been anticipated prior to
the NATO Enhanced Forward Presence exercise in the country.]{.underline}
[Local authorities, once having registered the falsity of the planted
story, alerted the StratCom team]{.underline}, [which quickly debunked
it and alerted all relevant stakeholders]{.underline}. The first
Lithuanian media coverage on the subject was not "a little girl
allegedly raped", as with the German counterpart, but rather "another
information attack against Lithuania". An extremely high awareness of
disinformation campaigns in the country, as well as a timely exposure of
the false story (which by definition had to involve the often-dismissed
debunking of the story), resulted in one of the most instructive success
stories in the entirety of the EU thus far.

[However, given the fact that audiences today are more fragmented than
ever before,]{.underline} it is [necessary to move beyond the small
circle of government officials and experts]{.underline} focused on the
topic, and try to [raise the awareness among broader audi- ences as
well.]{.underline} [One proven way to attract wider audiences is through
humor. In]{.underline} fact, the ridiculous nature of some of the
falsehoods spread by disinformers may provide a lot of ammunition for
jokes and ridicule. The [tweet by]{.underline} the Canadian Permanent
Representation to [NATO]{.underline}, which [ridiculed Russia's repeated
"mistakes"]{.underline} regarding geography, has already [become
well-known]{.underline} (@CanadaNATO, 2014; Burtch, 2018). The official
account of the Ukrainian presidential office mocked the Kremlin's propa-
gandistic appropriation of Ukraine's history as being a part of Russian
history with a [GIF from The Simpsons]{.underline} (Thomsen, 2017). The
EUvsDisinfo project has a [rubric for lighter]{.underline}, [sarcastic
pieces that]{.underline} [make fun of recent propaganda]{.underline}.24
Taiwan's Prime Minister has also used [funny memes directed
towards]{.underline} COVID-related [disinformation]{.underline} (Yang,
2020).

Interestingly, [research shows that act of ridiculing can work well with
general audiences]{.underline}, although it is not advised when
appealing to conspiracy theorists (Lewandowsky & Cook, 2020). In spring
2021, EUvsDisinfo published a specialized guide to communicating with
those who believe the COVID-related conspiracy theo- ries (EUvsDisinfo,
2021a). The US State Department's Global Engagement Center (GEC) details
the use of a "counter-brand approach", in which those countering
disinformation should not refute every single false claim, but rather
point out the untrustworthiness of the source spreading disinformation,
thus reaching broader, mainstream audiences (GEC, 2020b).

Notably, [professional influencers are likely the most effective at
broadening their audiences and reaching beyond the typical filter
bubbles of civil servants]{.underline} and NGO activists. One such
success story once again takes place in Lithuania; a local TV
journalist, Andrius Tapinas, launched a show named "Hang in There"
(Schearf, 2017), in reference to the ridiculed response of then Russian
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev to a Crimean pensioner who confronted him
about the low pensions in Russia (RFE/RL, 2016). As Tapinas himself
describes, the aim of the show is to make fun of the Russian government
and politics. In the Czech Republic, the Youtuber known as Kovy has
filmed a series of videos aimed at increasing media literacy among the
country's younger generation, as well warning about the dangers of
manipulated information (Jeden sveˇt na školách, 2019). Kovy's primary
audience are Czech youth---an audience primarily untouched by both
government, NGO and CSO initiatives on the project.

It must be acknowledged that [some methods of communication may work
effec- tively for only a part of a given audience and may be ineffective
for another]{.underline}---[but this is not a justification to stop
implementing these various methods.]{.underline} As journalist Anne
Applebaum documented prior to the onset of COVID-19 in Italy regarding
the anti- vaccination disinformation campaign, [different approaches to
raising awareness of a threat will reach and impact different
people,]{.underline} but this does not make one approach better or worse
than another (Applebaum, 2019). [Efforts towards finding new opinion
leaders to reach new audiences should never stop---there is always a
means to make a given message resonate.]{.underline}

5 Conclusions

As the volume of online content continues to grow, [automated
fact-checking holds great potential as a speedier and cost-efficient
complement to]{.underline}, or even replacement of, [human
oversight]{.underline} -- [by blocking]{.underline} or removing [false
content before it is uploaded online]{.underline}. It might take another
five to ten years for AI to make nuanced distinctions and proactively
identify harmful content embedded in linguistic, cultural, and political
contexts with minimal to no human input.116 [For as long as AI does not
grasp context and grey areas, human supervision remains
critical.]{.underline} As regards their accuracy, detection algorithms
need to be further developed to reach the efficiency level of e-mail
spam filters.

As this paper demonstrates, the [development of AI systems is a
two-edged sword for democratic societies]{.underline}. On the one hand,
[AI]{.underline} systems [will improve human processes and tasks in the
online environment, such as detection of disinformation, bots, altered
text and images, and manipulated audio and video material.]{.underline}
On the other hand, [when the same technologies are adopted by
adversaries, they will enable them to magnify the effectiveness and
scale of]{.underline} [i]{.underline}nformation
[o]{.underline}peration[s]{.underline}. [As ideological and geopolitical
tensions between democratic and authoritarian states continue to grow,
AI]{.underline} and computational propaganda [are likely to become tools
of political warfare]{.underline} used [against]{.underline} [democratic
societies]{.underline}.

[There needs to be a greater global effort to work on ways to detect and
respond to AI-generated content. Policies aiming to combat false and
harmful content should]{.underline} already [be focusing on the next
generation of disinformation]{.underline} which, [fuelled by advances in
AI]{.underline} and decentralised computing, [promises to
spread]{.underline} [faster, to be more sophisticated, and harder to
detect]{.underline}.

New technologies evolve far quicker than government policies and often
undermine existing legal and policy frameworks. [In order to
ensure]{.underline} [responsible use of AI]{.underline}, as well as to
develop the right responses for its potential misuses early on,
[stronger connections, partnerships, and open conversations need to be
established between policymakers]{.underline}, engineers, [and
researchers]{.underline}.117 [Acknowledging that technology
companies]{.underline}, including social media platforms, [can provide
powerful solutions, governments]{.underline} and other stakeholders
[should strive to cooperate with them in order to develop better filters
to prevent the spread of disinformation.]{.underline} Broader ex-ante
consultation with online platforms, users, and other stakeholders would
help prevent pitfalls such as unrealistic legislative proposals, a lack
of balance in the distribution of responsibilities, and regulation or
infringement of freedom of expression. Enhancing dialogue between
relevant stakeholders will generate more realistic and agile policies.

The internet, social media, artificial intelligence, and other digital
technologies are enabling the manipulation of the information
environment for strategic purposes. Global [hyper-connectivity and
increasing competitiveness have propelled [info]{.mark}rmation
[warfare]{.mark}]{.underline} [as a viable means of
achieving]{.underline} strategic [objectives---but what its]{.underline}
theory and [[practice]{.mark} means can [vary from military to
military]{.mark}]{.underline} and expert to expert. Indeed, a lack of
universal definitions, combined with a desire by military thinkers to
carve things up into military domains and focus on hardware and
technology, has left the role of information in the context of 21st
century warfare insufficiently examined. This article, building on a
previous one entitled \"The Strategic Communication Ricochet,\"
considers why information is more than a domain, and how [[military
exercises must be adapted]{.mark} accordingly [to foster]{.mark}
increased [resilience to info]{.mark}rmation
[warfare]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The idea that information can be used in conflict is not new---great
military strategists such as Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, and Clausewitz all
emphasized using information to outmaneuver an enemy.\[1-3\] Despite an
historic awareness of information in warfare, finding an internationally
accepted definition of information warfare has been a challenge. Part of
the problem is the word information itself---which can encompass many
things. For example, one meaning as provided by the Oxford Dictionary is
"data as processed, stored, or transmitted by a computer"---this could
entail everything from code to content.\[4\] This understanding has been
reflected in some military materials, such as the U.S. handbook on
Inform and Influence Activities, which breaks the information
environment out into three dimensions:  the physical (e.g.,
infrastructure), informational (e.g., data) and cognitive (e.g., values,
beliefs).\[5\] Such scope, however, means that [[info]{.mark}rmation
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} actually [integrated [in]{.mark}to]{.underline}
nearly [[everything]{.mark} a [military does]{.mark}---from command and
control]{.underline} functions [to public affairs. [Yet,
info]{.mark}rmation [activities are]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[treated
as]{.mark} something stand alone,]{.underline} or [[unrelated
to]{.underline}]{.mark} more traditional [[military]{.mark}
domains]{.underline}. Moreover, when it comes to the [cognitive
dimension of [info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline} in particular, there is
an emphasis on outgoing communication with little attention to how such
content [[will]{.mark} be twisted]{.underline} and used by adversaries
against the sender [to [negatively affect leadership and
decision-making]{.mark}]{.underline}.

What is lacking at the moment, both conceptually and from a strategic
perspective, is an understanding for what information has become, and
how every action, from those of the top general at headquarters to those
of a private in theatre, carries with it challenges and opportunities
for friendly strategic communication as well as adversarial
exploitation. The [[ways information can be shaped
demands]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[each activity during mission
planning]{.underline}]{.mark} and corresponding exercises [[be
reimagined for its]{.mark}]{.underline} cascading [[exploitative
potential]{.underline}]{.mark}---which means [looking]{.underline} far
[beyond]{.underline} the [basics]{.underline} of public affairs or
social media messaging [in training scenarios]{.underline}.

[Despite]{.underline} the [changing information
environment]{.underline}, most [[military doctrine focuses only on
outgoing communications]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [practitioners conduct
military exercises]{.underline} as Ian Kippen notes in a recent Small
Wars Journal article, [in a linear fashion [putting]{.mark}]{.underline}
greater [[emphasis on later phases of]{.underline}]{.mark} operational
[[preparedness]{.underline}]{.mark} (such as defend, restore, and
transition).\[6\] [Such an approach [leaves]{.mark} the [most critical
first phase]{.mark}]{.underline} (deter) aiming to avoid conflict
entirely, or create a more favorable starting position for later
fighting, [[less practiced]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, [[this is
precisely]{.mark} the phase [where manipulation of]{.mark} the
[info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline} environment by an adversary [would
[occur, enabling them to mislead]{.mark} friendly [leadership and deny
time and opportunities for preparation and
coordination]{.mark}]{.underline} of activities. As it stands, most
[operational [exercises fail to integrate info]{.mark}rmation
[activities]{.mark}]{.underline} in a meaningful manner [[into]{.mark}
all phases of [training]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly the early
planning stages. As a result, while information and strategic
communication activities are continuously generated in support of other
operations, [there is [no]{.mark}]{.underline} fostering of the
[[necessary understanding for]{.mark} the [role of info]{.mark}rmation
[in modern warfare at all levels of military]{.mark}]{.underline} or
relevant supporting agencies within and outside of government.

[[NATO]{.mark} notes]{.underline} on its website that ["exercises are
important tools through which]{.underline} the [Alliance tests and
validates its concepts, procedures, systems and tactics]{.underline}.
More broadly, [they [enable militaries]{.mark}]{.underline} and civilian
organizations [deployed]{.underline} in theatres of operation [[to test
capabilities]{.mark} and practice working together]{.underline}
efficiently [[in a]{.mark} demanding [crisis
situation]{.mark}]{.underline}."\[7\] Arguably, [[in a digital
age]{.mark}, militaries]{.underline} and their partners [[must]{.mark}
also [do]{.mark} all of [this]{.mark} with[in a complex
info]{.mark}rmation [environment]{.mark}]{.underline}, and as such,
training must adapt to develop appropriate skills beyond specialist
units. Ultimately, these findings should bring about several key changes
in how the military structures their training exercises.

#### Military susceptibility to disinformation risks compromising US and allies deterrence capabilities

Armed Forces and Disinformation

Like the nation it protects, the US military is increasingly diverse.
Women made up 16 percent of the active-duty force in 2017, and ethnic
minorities currently comprise 42 percent of military personnel.20 This
diversity can leave [the military]{.underline}, like the country at
large, [vulnerable to disinformation campaigns]{.underline}. These
[campaigns represent a serious challenge to operational security
and]{.underline} the overall [cohesion of the armed forces, their
allies, and the wider defense community.]{.underline}

For example, [adversaries have consistently targeted]{.underline} the
[forces making up NATO's]{.underline} Enhanced Forward [Presence in
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland]{.underline}. In 2020,
Russian-sponsored actors released a forged letter online where Polish
Brigadier General Ryszard Parafianowicz appeared to criticize openly the
American presence in his country during the US-led exercise
DefenderEurope 20. During the same exercise, Russian sources also
claimed the US military had ignored COVID-19--related travel
restrictions, even though US officials had reduced the size and scope of
Defender-Europe 20 due to public health considerations.21 The [threat of
influence]{.underline} no longer [exists]{.underline} only during
deployment but also [in garrison]{.underline} [because of "the collapsed
nature of communication . . . and . . . porous boundaries between war
and everyday life,"]{.underline} which means [geography is no longer
enough to act as a defense]{.underline}.22

[Hostile actors consistently target]{.underline} members of [the US
armed forces]{.underline} and veteran communities online. Beginning in
2017, Vietnam Veterans of America, a congressionally chartered nonprofit
organization, began a two-year investigative study and discovered,
"[persistent, pervasive, and coordinated online targeting of American
servicemembers, veterans, and]{.underline} their [families by foreign
entities]{.underline}."23 The report demonstrated
[servicemembers]{.underline} and their social networks [are vulnerable
to disinformation]{.underline}. Foreign entities see members of the
military community, who often have access to confidential and classified
materials, as an attractive target. What is more, [active
members]{.underline} and veterans [are a significant influence
demographic in US political life]{.underline}. A team of Vietnam
Veterans of America researchers inspected hundreds of Facebook pages and
social media accounts and found American servicemembers, veterans, and
other social media followers of several veterans organizations were
specifically targeted by foreign entities.24 They also found individuals
from over 30 countries administered the sites they reviewed, and that
administrators of these imposter Facebook pages infiltrated other public
and private groups.

Imposter pages and accounts built a following by impersonating
legitimate military and veterans groups, like the Vietnam Veterans of
America, and used camaraderie and community as a way to attract new
members. This activity was so prolific Facebook shut down a third of the
reviewed accounts for inauthentic behavior or "misleading actions to
deceive others about who an individual/group is or what the individual
or group is doing."25 Before the shut down, the pages drew over 32
million users. Foreign administrators had used the platforms to "try to
drive wedges between groups along varying racial or ethnic identities or
prejudices, often pitting law enforcement against minorities."26 This
action frequently involved posting divisive content designed to polarize
group members, from sharing pictures of NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick
to spreading false information about controversial public figures like
Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and posting xenophobic statements
like "VETS BEFORE ILLEGALS" to play on sensitive topics like
immigration.27 Disinformation targets fault lines within a society, and
military personnel are not immune to these tactics.

[Adversary disinformation campaigns undermine servicemembers' ability to
discern fact from fiction]{.underline}. These [campaigns
penetrate]{.underline} their so[cial networks and make them susceptible
to conspiracy theories and extremist groups]{.underline}, [which
degrades unit cohesion and presents a real force protection
threat]{.underline}. Although there are no indications an adversary was
directly responsible for the US Capitol attack of 2021, years of
influence operations culminated in a distorted cognitive
environment---an alternate reality---for many who participated in the
riots, and implanted a lasting social and political division that could
continue for years.28 Using the attack as an example, adversaries will
continue active disinformation campaigns and employ all information
domain tools to exacerbate discord and strengthen their position.29
[Russia has used]{.underline} digital [media to fan]{.underline} the
[flames following the Capitol attack, and China's media has taken the
opportunity to create]{.underline} false [equivalencies to]{.underline}
justify its behaviors and [undermine]{.underline} faith in [democratic
processes]{.underline} and US legitimacy as a global leader.30

These effects offer clear evidence online conspiracy theories and
disinformation do not remain online only but can and do culminate in
violence. While [disinformation]{.underline} is insidious and [creates
long-lasting effects at]{.underline} the national, [strategic, and
tactical levels]{.underline}, it can be mitigated through awareness and
education.

#### The [Defense Department]{.underline} needs to take action on [information warfare]{.underline} \-\-- Russia Proves

Tonya **Riley 21** (Tonya, Technology and cybersecurity policy

National [security experts]{.underline} will [warn Congress]{.underline}
today that [the U.S. government]{.underline} [isn\'t doing enough to
fight]{.underline} back against [the]{.underline} growing [national
security threat of information warfare]{.underline} aimed at [sowing
distrust in the U.S. government at home and abroad.]{.underline}

"[Cyber-enabled disinformation]{.underline}, whether domestically or
foreign generated, [is a national security problem]{.underline},
[corroding our democracy and governmental institutions]{.underline}, and
[threatening our public health and]{.underline}, potentially, public
[safety]{.underline}," [former NSA general counsel]{.underline} Glenn
Gerstell will testify in front of the House Armed Services subcommittee
on cyber, innovative technologies and information systems.

Other witnesses include Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation fellow at the
Wilson Center; Herb Lin, senior research scholar at the center for
international security and cooperation at Stanford University; as well
as Joseph Kirschbaum, director of the defense capabilities and
management team at the Government Accountability Office.

The hearing underscores how [the United States has struggled to combat
the emerging cyberthreat of information warfare]{.underline}.

[The rise of social media and other emerging technologies]{.underline}
has [enabled foreign adversaries to escalate their offenses]{.underline}
in recent years. [Russia and other adversaries relied on social media,
bots and data leaks to stir up trouble in]{.underline} both the [2016
and 2020 elections]{.underline}. In 2019, the FBI became aware that
Trump campaign advisor Rudolph W. [Giuliani was the target of a Russian
influence campaign]{.underline}, as Ellen Nakashima, Shane Harris and
Tom Hamburger scooped yesterday. [The warning reflects a broader concern
by U.S. intelligence about Russia\'s influence operations during the
election]{.underline}, they wrote.

The [U.S. intelligence]{.underline} community [warned]{.underline} that
"[Russia will remain a top cyber threat as it refines and employs its
espionage, influence, and attack capabilities]{.underline}," in its
annual worldwide threats report earlier this year. Other adversaries,
such as [China and Iran, are also stepping up their information
warfare]{.underline}, the report warns.

Engagement in information operations also isn\'t limited to election
cycles: [China and Russia launched disinformation campaigns around the
coronavirus]{.underline}. Experts say that kind of [interference will
only get worse.]{.underline}

But so far [the United States has failed to respond to those escalations
with an integrated government approach]{.underline}, Jankowicz says in
her written testimony.

"[Rather than organizing crosscutting, proactive, whole-of-government
responses, we have mostly stood up ad hoc capabilities]{.underline} only
when necessary, [such as election war rooms]{.underline} before events
like the 2018 and 2020 elections," she writes.

#### Military cooperation with NATO is key\-\--[resources]{.underline} and [expertise.]{.underline}

In addition to the Three Warfares[, China has made advances
in]{.underline} conceptualizing "[strategic [info]{.mark}rmation
[war]{.mark}". This concept "refers to the use of information and
information technology in the political, economic, (science &
technology), diplomatic, cultural, and military arenas to secure
information advantage]{.underline}. In this broad sense, [information
war [spans military and civilian spheres,]{.mark} peacetime and wartime,
and has a global nature]{.underline}." \[35\]  Although there are a
variety of names for [[the Russian approach]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
most accurate [[appears to be "new generation warfare]{.mark}" which "is
manifested in five component elements: [political subversion]{.mark},
proxy sanctuary, intervention, coercive deterrence and negotiated
manipulation." ]{.underline}\[36[\] Together these two approaches
[provide a significant threat to the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates,
[NATO]{.mark} Allies [and]{.mark} like-minded [partners]{.mark} around
the world.]{.underline} This means that [we all need to be competing in
the information space.]{.underline} Information competition is so
important that the Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs]{.mark} of Staff
recently [designated "info]{.mark}rmation" to be [a joint
function]{.mark}, co-equal with the existing joint functions of command
and control, intelligence, fires, movement and maneuver, protection, and
sustainment.]{.underline} \[37\]

[The military has five functions that partially exist in the information
environment and seven that exist entirely within the environment:
[Info]{.mark}rmation Operations (IO), Military Deception, Psychological
Operations (PSYOPs]{.underline}, also known as Military Information
Support Operations or MISO), Public Affairs, and Strategic
Communications are entirely within the environment. [Communications &
Signals, Cyber, Electronic Warfare]{.underline} (EW), Intelligence,
Space operations and Operations Security (OPSEC) exist partially within.
Physical operations also have an information effect, as when a US Army
unit goes to a firing range in eastern Poland. [All of these functions
[are]{.mark} legitimate [military operations within
cyberspace.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Conventional information operations are the age-old arts of
persuasion.]{.underline} They are sometimes called propaganda (if your
opponents are performing the operations), educational material (if your
side is doing it) or even advertising via printed text, radio waves or
television. Since tribes formed before history was captured, [human
beings have shaped the cognition of other human beings, both in the 'in
group' and the 'out group.']{.underline} Even though operations in the
information environment have been central to civilization from the
beginning, these operations expanded dramatically with the
communications revolution inherent in the advent of the telegraph in the
1800s and accelerated with the further evolutionary additions of radio
and television.

[A new category of operations in the information environment is
cyber-enabled information operations,]{.underline} which began with the
arrival of the Internet. [This takes the form of a traditional operation
which uses cyber to magnify the Impact of the operation or to enable the
operation itself. The hack of the Democratic National Committee would be
an example of a cyber-enabled information operation.]{.underline} The
information was obtained through cyber operations (the enabling
function) but released via Wikileaks and thence to mainstream media
outlets, a more traditional method of disseminating information.

[[Cyber info]{.mark}rmation [op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} are a
relatively new set of information operations that takes place entirely
in cyberspace. An example would include Daesh recruiting videos. Videos
are smoothly produced in a variety of languages and are aimed at global
youth. As their target audience are digital natives, Daesh builds their
products to be consumed as they do other digital
materials. \[38\]]{.underline}

[Countering these types of operations [requires]{.mark} that the same
techniques be used. As the Carter Center says]{.underline}, "The
implementation of preventative community-based policies will equip
trusted Islamic scholars and religious leaders with [[the necessary
analysis and digital tools]{.underline}]{.mark}" \[39\] meaning that
[people hoping to counter them must use digital techniques to compete.
[This makes]{.mark} operations in [the info]{.mark}rmation [environment
a key cyber mission for militaries.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Military Operations and Cyberspace

Military operations can also be cyber-enabled or executed purely in
cyberspace. This analytic framework discusses two types of military
operations: conventional and special operations.

\[figure 5 omitted\]

Cyber can either enable an operation or can be the operation itself. As
such, there are cyber-enabled conventional operations, cyber-enabled
special operations, conventional cyber operations and special cyber
operations. Cyber-enabled conventional operations happen on a daily
basis while almost all special operations (due to the availability of
resources) are cyber-enabled. It is probably safe to assume that cyber
conventional operations happen frequently and regularly. Cyber special
operations, like their kinetic namesake, probably do not occur often.

An example of a conventional or normal military operation would be the
invasion of Iraq. An example of a special operation would be the raid to
eliminate Osama bin Laden. Although these operations occurred with a
minimum of cyber enabling, as time goes on and cyber capabilities
suffuse militaries, more and more of these operations will become
cyber-enabled. Eventually, all conventional and special operations will
become cyberenabled unless specific counter-cyber operations negate that
advantage.

An example of a cyber-enabled conventional military operation would be
Russian operations in Georgia in 2008. Although Russia previously
conducted purely cyber operations against Estonia in 2007, Georgia was
different in that Russia conducted cyber operations against targets in
Georgia to affect Georgian command and control in support of
conventional military operations on the ground and air. \[40\]

An example of a cyber-enabled special operation would be the Mumbai
attacks of 2008. Planners used a Go-Pro camera and walked the route so
everyone could see videos of their routes during their preparation for
the operation. Planners used Google Earth during their planning process.
The command and control element monitored Indian social media

and traditional media (such as radio and television) to track the
response by Indian security forces and steered the attacking force away
from reacting Indian forces, enabling the operation to continue much
longer than expected. \[41\]

As mentioned, cyber military operations also come in two flavors:
conventional and special operations. A conventional cyber operation
would be like "dropping cyber bombs on Daesh". Secretary of Defense Ash
Carter explained at an event at US Northern Command that "We're using
these tools to deny the ability of ISIL leadership to command and
finance their forces and control their populations; to identify and
locate ISIL cyber actors; and to undermine the ability of ISIL
recruiters to inspire or direct Homegrown Violent
Extremists," \[42\] Although the operations may be classified, mere
classification would not be sufficient to label this a special
operation. This is a conventional operation in that it does not require
special techniques or unique modes of employment, and does not require a
covert approach to the operation.

According to Joint Publication 3-05, Special Operations, these
operations require: ... unique modes of employment, tactics, techniques,
procedures, and equipment. They are often conducted in hostile, denied,
or politically and/or diplomatically sensitive environments, and are
characterized by one or more of the following: time-sensitivity,
clandestine or covert nature, low visibility, work with or through
indigenous forces, greater requirements for regional orientation and
cultural expertise, and a higher degree of risk...Special operations may
differ from conventional operations in degree of strategic, physical,
and political and/or diplomatic risk; operational techniques; modes of
employment; and dependence on intelligence and indigenous assets. \[43\]

A cyber special operation would be the Stuxtnet attacks on Iran. It
meets many of the criteria for a special operation as defined above. It
required unique modes of employment, tactics, techniques, procedures,
and equipment. It was conducted in a hostile, denied, or politically
and/or diplomatically sensitive environments. It was a low visibility
operation characterized by a clandestine or covert nature, as manifested
by the fact that no one has yet proved who conducted the operation.

As militaries routinely conduct conventional and special operations,
these types of operations involving cyberspace are appropriate for
militaries to conduct. All operations will eventually be cyber-enabled
while there will be more and distinct cyber operations.

CONCLUSION

Because cyberspace is so large, and so much cyber activity occurs in the
private sector, militaries do not have any business operating in most of
cyberspace. Although militaries should be able to range anywhere
throughout cyberspace to complete appropriate missions, most cyber
activity should not involve the military at all.

There are pressures for the military to become more involved in
cyberspace. [DoD leaders]{.underline} have thus far managed to avoid
being dragged into additional areas, mainly by [sticking to DoD's three
cyber missions: Defend DoD networks, systems, and
information;]{.underline} Defend the U.S. homeland and U.S. national
interests against cyberattacks of significant consequence; and Provide
cyber support to military operational and contingency plans. These are
legitimate cyber missions for any military. These have been clearly
articulated by the U.S. military; however, other militaries probably
have not thought this through as they are busy building their cyber
forces.

As manifestations of these legitimate cyber missions, [there are four
areas in cyberspace that are appropriate for the military to operate in
crime, intelligence, [information operations]{.mark} and military
operations. This article has provided examples of how the military would
be involved in all four of these areas. Although]{.underline} military
forces are involved in these areas, they are not involved in all
operations in these areas (for instance, the Department of Justice
handles most cybercrime) but are involved in these areas. [This, then,
is the circumscribed area that [should be called the military cyber
domain. Militaries and Alliances like NATO around the world would do
well to conceptualize these missions as appropriate for military cyber
forces]{.mark}]{.underline}, understand why they should not be
performing cyber missions outside of these areas, and inform their
political masters that expanding cyber operations away from those four
missions risks frittering away cyber combat, which would put at risk the
overall mission of the military, the defense of the nation. 

#### The AFF solves\-- Only a properly funded, strategic communication effort can counter Russia's attack on Western media

Henry **RIdgewell** **2016**, Henry Ridgwell reports for VOA from
London, September 2016, "NATO Warns West Is \'Losing Information War\'
Against Russia, IS", Voice of America News /sk

LONDON - [The West must step up its efforts to combat and counter the
information war being waged by its opponents, according to NATO
officials. They warn that countries like Russia are exploiting the
freedom of the press in Western media to spread
disinformation.]{.underline} The term \"hybrid warfare\" is frequently
used to describe the tactics used by the Kremlin in its forceful
takeover of Crimea in 2014, when unmarked, heavily armed gunmen now
widely known as the \'little green men\' began storming Ukrainian
military bases in the region. Moscow initially denied they were Russian
military, yet weeks later similar unidentified armed units appeared in
eastern Ukraine. That conflict between Russia-backed rebels and the
Ukrainian military is still continuing. The West is under attack
Speaking at this month\'s United Nations General Assembly, Ukraine\'s
President Petro Poroshenko said hybrid warfare is being waged against
the whole Western world. [\"Political pressure, blatant propaganda,
interference with the electoral process, economic coercion, secret
subversive and military operations, cyberattacks, misuse of diplomatic
measures, these are modern and congenial methods of the undeclared
war,\" Poroshenko said.]{.underline} At a recent conference on
Information Warfare at the London-based Royal United Services Institute,
the Director of the NATO StratCom Center of Excellence Janis Sarts said
[the West is playing catch-up.]{.underline} West not focused on this
type of warfare \"The technology is ours. The marketing powerhouses are
in our countries. Yet we\'re having this discussion against the feeling
of being pushed. Against the feeling of being pushed by different
actors: Russia, Daesh\... also China in more subtle ways,\" said Sarts,
using and Arabic term for the Islamic State. The conference focused on
the growing reach of Russian state media such as the 24-hour news
channel Russia Today or RT, often accused of being a propaganda outlet
for the Kremlin[. Senior editor at The Economist Edward Lucas argued
channels like RT should not be considered as journalism. \"Russia has
really grasped the post-truth environment. And they will lie about
things absolutely brazenly. They understand the weaknesses of our media
in the post-Cold War environment: that we prioritize fairness over
truth.\"]{.underline} Russia investing big money [Lucas added the West
should do more about what he termed \"social media hygiene.\" \"There\'s
a real problem with comment fields, and with fake social media accounts,
particularly on Twitter. The Russians are putting lots and lots of money
into creating tens of thousands of trolls.\" Mark Laity, the chief of
Strategic Communications at NATO\'s Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers
Europe or SHAPE, noted that Russia includes information strategy as a
key pillar of its conflict planning, but in the West the communications
are often handed off to separate public relations teams. \"We are still
fighting on the margins,\" he said, \"when actually a properly funded,
strategic communication effort is incredibly cheap compared to other
costs.\"]{.underline} Laity warned Russia was deploying disinformation
and hybrid warfare in its intervention in Syria - most recently in the
disputed bombing of an aid convoy outside Aleppo earlier this month. He
added [the West must learn how to fight back.]{.underline}

[Train for Disinformation]{.underline}, Focus on Key Demographics, and
[Minimize Widespread Bans]{.underline} on Smart Phone and Social Media
Use

[[The joint force]{.mark} has [made significant strides]{.mark} toward
[incorporating counter-disinformation]{.mark} efforts on social media
into their regimen. One way has been to simulate the social media
environment through such programs as ION. Another has been to make
real-world information environment monitoring a part of regular training
exercises, such as Trident Juncture.]{.underline} There are pros and
cons to both approaches, but [[detecting and responding to
disinfo]{.mark}rmation [needs to be built into training programs---from
the unit level down to the individual service member]{.mark}
level---[particularly as disinformation on social media becomes a staple
of great-power competition.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[This expansion of disinformation training will push the joint force to
reach new audiences]{.underline}, possibly in uncomfortable ways. U.S.
adversaries do not target all service members equally; they might not
even narrow their focus to just service members. China tends to base its
disinformation campaigns on ethnic lines, placing Chinese- and Taiwanese
Americans at greater risk of attack.7 Russia targets military family
members. In 2015 and 2016, several military spouses---many of whom led
military family support groups or wrote about military family matters---
received death threats on Facebook and Twitter from a group claiming to
be "Cyber Caliphate" but actually tied to Russian intelligence, possibly
in a bid to deflect attention from Russia's actions in Ukraine and
encourage support for Russia's action to fight the Islamic states in the
Syrian conflict.8 [[Both Russia and China could launch
disinfo]{.mark}rmation [campaigns that do not target U.S. audiences at
all but still hamper the joint force's ability to operate by
targeting]{.mark} local communities where the [joint force bases
overseas]{.mark}. Properly [training]{.mark} for disinformation
campaigns [requires reaching out to new audiences]{.mark} (such as
family members and base communities) [and tailoring modules]{.mark} for
specific at-risk groups.]{.underline}

Training all service members and family members to recognize
disinformation campaigns is a herculean task. A simpler solution would
be to ban the use of smartphones and social media during periods of
conflict. However, such a policy could prove impractical. As Ukraine's
experience during the height of the conflict in the Donbass
demonstrated, smartphone bans, even for front-line soldiers, proved
difficult to enforce because bored soldiers found ways to smuggle phones
to the front. 9 Theoretically, [the joint force could pursue limited
technological solutions]{.underline} (e.g[., jamming reception or
blocking access to certain sites]{.underline}) or selectively enforce
bans for certain key units for limited periods of time, but improving
force resiliency against disinformation will still depend mostly on
training.

### DOD Key\-\--Training 

#### DoD training is [key]{.underline}

In addition to the computer-based training, the [service components
should also implement focused in-person media literacy training at the
company level. Sessions should be held in small classrooms or town halls
and led by DoD facilitators,]{.underline} from public affairs or
communication strategy and operations, who have been trained by leading
public-sector practitioners. The training should address trouble areas
flagged by the annual computer-based class and facilitate practical
application exercises that test the students' ability to recognize and
counter disinformation using personal devices. The practical application
exercises would model leading public-sector courses but would focus on
DoD equities. The in-person class would also offer an opportunity for
servicemembers to discuss ongoing adversarial cyberattacks, media
influence, military actions, challenges faced by partners and allies,
and foreign interference in domestic events.

In addition, family [predeployment briefs should integrate media
literacy training]{.underline} to increase awareness [before a
servicemembers' deployment.]{.underline} Although the Department of
Defense cannot mandate family members take online media literacy
training, [many are concerned about the threat of false information and
welcome opportunities to understand and protect themselves from these
threats.]{.underline}43 Family readiness officers and key spouse leaders
are also conduits to promote and share online media literacy education
opportunities and encourage awareness.

[Servicemembers]{.underline} and their families [must learn]{.underline}
and practice media literacy skills [so they can protect themselves and
counter adversary initiatives]{.underline}.44 Awareness [programs would
help them realize the disinformation threat and encourage them to defend
themselves]{.underline}.45 [A DoD-mandated, standardized, and
multifaceted media literacy program that combines public-sector best
practices and DoD equities can produce a comprehensive computer-based
course]{.underline} and an in-person course that provides servicemembers
and families the skills they need to [confront adversary disinformation
threats successfully.]{.underline}

Conclusion

[The pace of technological acceleration and the division inherent in
recent politics shows no signs of abating]{.underline}. As a result,
[the world will continue to face a proliferation of
disinformation]{.underline} in online spaces, [enhanced by sophisticated
technology like deepfake videos]{.underline}.46 These [advancements make
it]{.underline} [difficult to determine attribution or debunk
disinformation]{.underline} and create a serious threat to democratic
institutions, [which are increasingly diverse]{.underline} in
composition.47

While decisionmakers have considered a variety of solutions, none are
likely to have the lasting impact of thorough media literacy
education.48 In 2017, former "Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
General Joseph Dunford Jr. . . . designat\[ed\] information as the
seventh joint warfare function."49 [For troops to be effective warriors,
they must possess the skills needed to navigate a deceptive environment
and recognize when and how they are being manipulated
online.]{.underline} In "Deepfakes and the New Disinformation War,"
Robert Chesney and Danielle Citron argue, "democracies will have to
accept an uncomfortable truth: in order to survive the threat . . .
[they are going to have to learn how to live with lies]{.underline}."50
If democratic societies are to function effectively, everyone will have
to learn to survive and thrive in a complicated digital landscape.

\*\*IO=Information Operation

[[Information Operations]{.underline}]{.mark}. Another [critical aspect
of [imposing costs and limiting options]{.mark} available through
Russia's hybrid warfare approach is effective IO attribution and
response]{.underline}. [IO is substantive enough a factor
in]{.underline} Russian [hybrid warfare to be considered]{.underline}
beyond comprehensive [defense]{.underline}. Staying abreast of Russian
hybrid objectives, methods, and tools prevents Allies and partners from
being caught flat-footed. [[It]{.mark} also [enables]{.mark} a better
[understanding of]{.mark}]{.underline} Russian [[intent]{.mark} and
options [for hybrid activity]{.mark}]{.underline}, both [in traditional
spheres and within the gaps and seams of 21st-century
technology]{.underline} as an information platform. [[This analysis
focuses on the intelligence]{.mark}- and information-[gathering and
strategic communication]{.mark} aspects of IO]{.underline}.
[Intelligence- and information-gathering are [critical to
identify]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia's [[hybrid options]{.mark} and
intent and [to mobilize NATO]{.mark} member [states]{.mark} toward the
activity]{.underline}. Conversely, [strategic communication is a
proactive, comprehensive defense measure to specifically
limit]{.underline} Russian [[hybrid options]{.underline}]{.mark} and to
broadcast the costs Russia would incur if it moved forward with them.

For intelligence-gathering to be effective in today's operating
environment, [[countries must]{.mark} be willing to [break down
stovepipes and]{.mark} widely [share info]{.mark}rmation [within
their]{.mark} own [government]{.mark} structures as well as with
Allies]{.underline} and partners. [The [coordinated actions of hybrid
warfare]{.mark} allow Russia to [exploit]{.mark} regional, national, and
international [seams]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Building
[intelligence-sharing apparatuses]{.mark}]{.underline} both within and
without ministries [among and across countries helps to [close those
seams]{.mark}]{.underline}. Effective [intelligence-sharing could occur
at levels ranging from joint/multinational collection teams to finished
intelligence analysis at ministerial or national levels]{.underline}. In
other words, information-sharing does not always have to be top-down
driven; sometimes bottom-up is effective.

[One goal of [shared intelligence]{.mark} is to [reduce the time]{.mark}
required [for NATO to consult]{.mark} and respond]{.underline} in part
or as a whole. This effort could be facilitated by a common intelligence
picture shared by all parties. Partial, inconsistent, or stovepiped
intelligence might slow NATO's response process by creating doubt or
failing to correctly attribute malign activity to the Russian
government. In addition, whether internal to a state or between allied
states, stovepiping challenges coordinated action against hybrid
warfare. [[Better intelligence-sharing]{.mark} would [allow states to
deny Russia the benefit of using IO]{.mark} techniques in hybrid warfare
to isolate specific states or populations]{.underline}. A [common
intelligence]{.underline} picture also [makes it more
likely]{.underline}, for example, [that a Russian intelligence operative
or team preparing to assassinate a dissident would be identified and
detained, and have the network and messaging compromised]{.underline}.
An example of intelligence-sharing success within NATO nations against
hybrid activity is the [[Baltic Special Operations Forces Intelligence
Fusion Cell]{.underline}]{.mark}, [a budding Estonian, Latvian,
Lithuanian, and Polish initiative that operates with assistance from the
United States]{.underline}. If implemented properly, [such intelligence
fusion cells might [provide key indications and warnings of Russian
hybrid warfare]{.mark} operations across the spectrum of
IO]{.underline}, denying Russia the benefit of being able to claim
noninvolvement/noninterference and could serve as a template for future
initiatives among other Allies and partners. Furthermore, such [[fusion
cells provide a path for connecting information across]{.mark} the
Alliance's multiple stovepipes, that is, the intra- and
inter-bureaucratic inertia and the multilingual nature of the
information environment. This enables a common intelligence
picture]{.underline} and, consequently, the ability of the Allies to
collectively deny Russian IO to access seams unfettered and without
attribution.

Once Russian hybrid warfare IO activity is recognized and NATO agrees a
response is appropriate, [[strategic communication would likely be
employed as the principal countermeasure]{.mark} and vanguard [to
prevent Russian activity]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The situational
awareness derived from the shared information and
intelligence]{.underline} discussed in the previous section [would be
critical to crafting targeted messages]{.underline}. Strategic
communication would likely be split between two audiences: external
actors and an audience internal to the conflict (that is, the targeted
population). [[Internal strategic communication efforts should focus on
countering the information aspect of hybrid
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}. Prior to a campaign, successful [strategic
communication might limit the vulnerability to target
audiences]{.underline}, such as the Russian-speaking minorities of the
Baltic states, or a Russian hybrid campaign. This is achieved by
negating Russia's plausible deniability concerning the sponsorship of
the conflict's version of "little green men" (or whatever the aggressor
looks like in that campaign). [Internal strategic messaging campaigns
must be swiftly organized and executed because they are most effective
if they prevent Russia from gaining a tactical advantage during the
initial "fog of war" period.]{.underline} Once a hybrid warfare campaign
has begun, [[the focus of external strategic communication
should]{.mark} be to [expose]{.mark} Russian [activities]{.mark} to
NATO]{.underline} (and the rest of the world). [[This might
undermine]{.mark} Russian [public support]{.mark} for such activities,
would [inform decisionmakers]{.mark} during NATO deliberations,
[and]{.mark} should [unite the international community]{.mark} against
the malign actor.]{.underline}

[Our unity and our ability to adapt is even more critical as we face a
more unpre- dictable, complex]{.underline}, [and rapidly changing sphere
of geopolitical conflict]{.underline}. We face [more sophisticated
cyber]{.underline}-[attacks and disinformation]{.underline}, a [more
assertive Russian, brutal terrorism, nuclear proliferation]{.underline},
[disruptive technologies ever.]{.underline} The [security impact of
climate change]{.underline}, so [crucial for own public
opinions]{.underline}, [and where NATO is embarking energetically in
that direction]{.underline}. [And, of course]{.underline}, the [most
critical game-changer]{.underline} in global affairs in many, many
decades, or probably centuries, is the [shift]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} the worldwide [balance of power with the rise of
China]{.underline}.

Such [hostile activities seek to undermine our democracies,]{.underline}
our institutions, our shared values on [which our Alliances is
founded]{.underline}. But perhaps more fundamentally, it [seeks to
undermine the trust of our citizens in]{.underline} the very
[institutions of democ- racy because]{.underline} this
[competition]{.underline}, global competition that never ends,
historically, is [today]{.underline} also a [competition of fundamental
ideas]{.underline}. And the most crucial part is what we do, not only to
describe this intimidation as worrisome and concerning but to take
concrete actions to face this phenomenon. We must continue to [invest in
our strategic communications capabilities and build an evidence-based
understanding of the (dis)information environment to contest a highly
contested communications space]{.underline}.

In the last past 18 months only, [COVID-19 has shown us how
disinformation and propaganda can be used to sow distrust, undermine
science, and threaten lives and our security.]{.underline} [We have
seen]{.underline} dangerous d[isinformation campaigns about]{.underline}
the [origins]{.underline} of the Coronavirus, [cyber-attacks on
hospitals]{.underline}, the nature of Alliance activities, [and online
espionage on medical research]{.underline} centers [working on
vaccines]{.underline} and treatments.

[Our information environment assessment capability must have
well-trained staff, supported by the right technology, with the right
scientifically informed under- standing to navigate this extraordinarily
complex field. It will be essential to develop objective-driven,
proactive communications strategies, responding rapidly to the
increasing volume of information attacks on our institutions, our
people, and our values.]{.underline}

NATO has shown that we remain ready and able to defend our nations, that
allies and partners are supporting each other, and that investing in our
Armed Forces is an investment in the strength and resilience of our
societies. This readiness was demonstrated in no uncertain terms by our
Alliance's vital role in fighting this deadly pandemic. This capacity
stretches across the maritime, land, air, cyber, and space domains, as
well as the information or cognitive sphere.

Taken together, this will help us build the resilience of our societies,
and building [resilience]{.underline} in our communities [requires a
whole-of-society approach]{.underline}. Everyone has a role to play; the
media, the private sector, academia, civil society, of course, the
whole-of-government. But it also includes all the relevant groups in our
communities to ensure that our institutions and citizens are equipped
for today's digital realities. [Beyond the nations that make up the
Alliance, we must work in concert with our partners to strengthen our
collective ability to prevent crisis and address
challenges.]{.underline} It is clear that [no nation alone,]{.underline}
no continent alone, [can cope with the magnitude of the challenges we
are now facing as democratic societies]{.underline}.

#### NATO action [now]{.underline} is [key]{.underline}\-\--the Strategic Concept provides [perfect timing]{.underline} for [renewed counterinformation tactics]{.underline}.

Towards a Consistent Response to Disinformation

At the same time, [the West has yet to prepare a coherent, comprehensive
and coordinated response to Russian disinformation. It is up to nations
to fully utilise NATO's potential]{.underline}. A response [practice has
been developed]{.underline} and seen partial success within some states
and Euro-Atlantic institutions, [but]{.underline} it has [not yet been
translated into a real common policy or strategy.]{.underline}

At national levels, [political declarations]{.underline} and agreed
action [plans are still not fully implemented]{.underline} in too many
instances. Western [states approach disinformation in varied
ways]{.underline} due to differences in history, regional security,
wealth, education, media quality, political and legal culture and --
most importantly -- the current state of their relations with Russia. As
a rule, some states prefer bilateral approaches that safeguard national
prerogatives. This may change now following the Russian invasion of
Ukraine.

Nevertheless, the challenge of [disinformation has begun to
attract]{.underline} higher [political attention.]{.underline} In the
European Union, this has transpired through the [adoption of the
European Democracy Action Plan]{.underline}4 [and]{.underline} the
presentation of [new regulations]{.underline} on digital services in
December 2020. These [regulations aim to address]{.underline} the core
issue of the business model developed by [disinformation
organisers]{.underline} who instrumentalise social media platforms. The
report by the Special Committee on Foreign Interference in all
Democratic Processes in the EU, including Disinformation (INGE), has
also promised that other means of influence will be addressed5.

In an effort to combat disinformation, the Digital Services Act (DSA)6
is a breakthrough legal instrument that will fundamentally change the
rules of the game for the information environment in the European Union,
member states and partner countries; it will also have an impact on
national approaches worldwide.7 The DSA will impose numerous legal
obligations on operators of online platforms that are more demanding
than the previous voluntary commitments outlined in the Code of Practice
for Fighting Disinformation. Companies will be obliged to cooperate with
independent researchers and allow them to access their data. They will
also participate in complaint and appeal procedures regarding content
moderation and dispute resolution. The DSA will provide for the
companies' obligatory consultations, including with civil society
organisations. It will also introduce the institution of trusted whistle
blowers, who, among other things, will notify the companies about
suspected crimes online. The act will correspondingly establish a
European Digital Services Council and advisory body made up of national
digital service coordinators responsible for implementing legislation at
the national level. It will impose specific additional duties on
exceptionally large online platforms with more than fortyfive million
users per month. These obligations will include assessing systemic risks
resulting from their services, identifying actions to reduce such risks,
conducting independent audits, setting appropriate conditions for
algorithmic recommendations of user content and ensuring additional
transparency in advertising (including political ads).

Among international organisations and institutions, the European Union
plays a leading role in counteracting disinformation and introducing new
effective measures against it. The future regulations on transparency in
financing political parties and election campaigns gives hope for
limiting corruption and external influence in the affairs of the member
states.8

NATO and the EU share similar membership compositions and were created
based on comparable value systems, so it is reasonable to assume that
counteracting disinformation will be more prominently reflected in
NATO's new Strategic Concept. A need for this has been suggested by the
authors of the NATO2030 expert group report prepared ahead of the Madrid
Summit in June 20229 . As a result, [countering disinformation could be
given a more visible place on the agenda of NATO ministerial meetings
and summits, and more proposals with clear commitments by member states
to tackle disinformation may be unveiled. NATO]{.underline} also [has
the opportunity to strengthen the mandates of existing committees to
better coordinate national efforts.]{.underline}

Strategic Context

[The Alliance's new Strategic Concept]{.underline} could therefore
reflect more comprehensively the key tenets of an enhanced approach to
disinformation, encompassing public diplomacy, strategic communication
and social resilience. Such an approach [could also consider new and
innovative tools to combat disinformation, given]{.underline} that
[these]{.underline} can [fit into a broader strategic context of NATO's
work]{.underline}.

In 2019, the Alliance approved not only the first secret military
strategy in over 50 years but also a strategy for developing the
necessary military and technological potential in connection with the
changing nature of conflicts (NATO Warfighting Capstone Concept). With
its stronger deterrence and defence approach to security, NATO began
implementing a policy that enabled the coordinated development of
breakthrough technologies, recognising that technology development will
be a priority in seven areas: (i) artificial intelligence, (ii) advanced
big data analysis, (iii) autonomous technologies, (iv) quantum computing
technologies, (v) biotechnology, (vi) hypersonic capabilities and (vii)
space technologies. In February 2021, the Allies approved the Coherent
Implementation Strategy on Emerging and Disruptive Technologies. Eight
months later, in October, the first NATO strategy on artificial
intelligence was approved. [From the perspective of
disinformation]{.underline} activities, the future of [artificial
intelligence can be seen as a dual-purpose tool]{.underline}. Depending
on human decisions, it can become a sword in the hands of opponents of
freedom or a shield that protects societies and individuals against the
consequences of their actions.

NATO Strategic Concept and Recommendations

[In light of the current security environment in Europe and
worldwide]{.underline}, traditional threats are still a priority, and
[collective defence will remain one of NATO's core
missions]{.underline}, even more so than in the 2010 document.

Among the tasks supporting this existing mission, [there
will]{.underline} also [be development of]{.underline} a full range of
instruments aimed at neutralising [new risks, including
disinformation]{.underline}. As experience has shown, [threats evolve
in]{.underline} terms of [intensity, goals]{.underline}, methods [and
means. The challenge for the]{.underline} negotiators of NATO's new
[Strategic Concept will]{.underline} therefore be to
[provide]{.underline} for [adequate flexibility]{.underline} [when
crafting]{.underline} current and future [countermeasures that will
guide the Alliance]{.underline}'s activities [for years to
come]{.underline}.

Overall, [NATO's]{.underline} (and the West's) [coherent
response]{.underline} and efforts [against]{.underline} foreign
[disinformation]{.underline}, both nationally and internationally,
[should focus on]{.underline}: (i) their [civic resilience]{.underline},
(ii) their [offensive capabilities as much as]{.underline} their
[defensive]{.underline} ones and (iii) [minimising]{.underline} the
[differences in how]{.underline} individual Western [countries approach
disinformation]{.underline} in practice. In other words, [deterrence
must be pursued through]{.underline} both [punishment and
denial]{.underline}. The [following recommendations apply specifically
to NATO but also]{.underline} to other organisations that can cooperate
more with the Alliance as well as [the member states]{.underline}
themselves, [for which NATO can act as a catalyst in the development of
national policies]{.underline} and practices10.

Disinformation campaigns are hardly new and have long been a staple of
geopolit- ical conflict. Nevertheless, [the precision, breadth, volume,
automation and audacity of such attacks are unprecedented.
Exploiting]{.underline} the situation, some states, social groups and
individuals with malice and forethought sought to conduct cognitive
warfare on entire populations, using the opportunities presented by
COVID-19 to seek political or social advantage. These have had, and will
continue to have, severe consequences for Alliance nations and the
health of its citizens. Ultimately, as we have discussed in this
chapter, the [NATO alliance has faced these issues through]{.underline}
the active [use of S&T and a focus on facts,]{.underline} concrete
actions, and trust-building. Nevertheless, [it is a well understood
psychological phenomenon that facts do not always win an
argument.]{.underline} While arguably a successful strategy, [the
lingering effects of these attacks suggest that the struggle is far from
over.]{.underline} In the end, whether it is at the strategic or
tactical level, conflict is a decidedly human activity. [The most
effective way to overcome an opponent is to impact their thoughts and
beliefs]{.underline}, [thereby turning them against themselves.
Continued research into disinformation and its impact on societies will
help develop new battle plans to counter these attacks]{.underline}.
Further, [the success and increasing development of more sophisticated
attacks suggest that cognitive warfare will become even more important
for the Alliance as potentially the sixth operational domain for
NATO.]{.underline}

The Future of US Information Warfare

Given the trends and convergence of information warfare, how might the
United States exploit these trends? On the face of it, [no country is
better positioned to carry out information war. US skills at cyberwar
have no equal. US institutions lead the world in the]{.underline}
commercialized [arts of persuasion, and the collection and analysis of
personal information for]{.underline} commercial and political [purposes
have proceeded farther in the United States than anywhere
else]{.underline}. No country is more advanced in digitizing and
networking things. [US expertise in systems integration is
unchallenged]{.underline}. But figuring out how to effectively harass
another country\'s citizens one at a time does not seem like an urgent
or important, much less permissible, US national security problem to
solve.

Nevertheless, [because other countries are interested in figuring out
how to combine]{.underline} these [elements of information warfare into
a unified whole, the United States ought to understand how to do so
itself]{.underline}. First, [there may be useful techniques
learned]{.underline} even if the larger idea is unacceptable. Second,
even though the prospect of operating a harassment campaign based on IW
is unpalatable, one cannot rule out occasions in which the only way to
stop others from doing so (short of armed conflict) may be a credible
offensive capability. Third, just as the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency was established shortly after Sputnik launched for the
purposes of preventing surprise- -and then went ahead to develop
technology that surprised others- dabbling in the arts of IW could help
prevent external developments from surprising the United States.

[If the United States were to embed cyber operations within a broader
context of IW]{.underline}, then [the mission and organization of US
Cyber Command would have to change]{.underline}. Today [it boggles the
mind to ask an organization]{.underline} (deservedly) [wrapped in great
secrecy to take the lead for influence operations]{.underline}, which
are ineluctably public. But in time, [the choice to overlook the
psychological effects of cyber operations or the potential synergy
between psychological operations and cyber operations would make just as
little sense]{.underline}.25 [Serious thought may be needed on how to
build an information warfare authority]{.underline}, whether housed
under one organization or achieved [through]{.underline} intense
[coordination among]{.underline} the [various communities: cyber
warriors, cyber intelligence collectors, electronic warriors,
psychological operators, and, in some cases, special
operators]{.underline}.

Perceptions of cyberwar might also need rethinking. One could debate the
plausibility of a determined cyber attack campaign unaccompanied by
violence. However, [it is hard]{.underline}er [to imagine a cyber attack
campaign unaccompanied by]{.underline} other elements of [information
warfare]{.underline}, in large part [because]{.underline} almost [all
situations where cyber attacks are useful are]{.underline} also [those
which offer no good reason not to use other elements of IW]{.underline}.
For instance, if another country is trying to exhaust US will by
conducting cyber attacks on information systems that underlie US
commerce, they would not necessarily try to blow up trucks. Rather,
cyber attacks that compromise trucks, to reduce confidence in their safe
operation, are more plausible, if achievable. It is also quite likely
that in a systematic campaign, attackers would try to jam GPS or
override satellite uplinks, using cyber espionage to create the
impression that they are watching Americans and are prepared to dox
particular individuals, or letting a thousand trolls bloom to create a
news environment that would pit Americans against each other. The latter
activities have attributes of nonlethality, unpredictability, ambiguity,
and persistence that allow them to fit the strategic niche occupied by
cyber attacks. [Preparations to retain resilience and accelerate
recovery after a cyber attack campaign would also do well to address the
complications that could arise if other elements of IW]{.underline} were
used in conjunction with cyber attacks.

Russia's Influence Operations in the Balkans,\"

Even the pandemic has the potential for fomenting political unrest. 

In recent days, thousands of Serbs have taken to the streets to protest
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic's announced strict curfew in response
to a surge in Covid-19 cases. Many have pointed a finger
at pro-Russia ultra-right groups and foreign intelligence services for
fueling the violent riots.

Moscow denies any "Russian trace" in the unrest. Whether Russia is
behind the violent protests in Belgrade remains to be seen. One thing is
for certain. The Kremlin's efforts to sow mayhem in the Balkans would
not be new; this would merely be the latest attempt by a resurgent
Russia to threaten Euro-Atlantic security and challenge the United
States' ability to defend its interests in Europe. 

[Russia is promoting]{.underline} its [interests in the]{.underline}
Western [Balkans through the widespread use of disinformation and
cyberwarfare. The U.S.]{.underline}, however, [isn't helpless. It has an
opportunity to]{.underline} obtain insights into these efforts and
[counter Russia\'s influence]{.underline} campaigns. [It is time to
confront]{.underline} Russia\'s strongman Vladimir [Putin\'s cyber
games]{.underline} before American interests are permanently damaged in
the Balkans. 

The U.S. and the E.U. have long been ambivalent about defining their
interests in the Western Balkans. [Russia has capitalized
on]{.underline} these [years of neglect and leveraged a power
vacuum]{.underline} in the former Yugoslavia [to gain]{.underline}
economic and political [influence. The region is now at the forefront of
Russia\'s]{.underline} use of low-cost [strategies to]{.underline}
expand its global influence and [undermine western
interests]{.underline}. 

[Russian disinformation]{.underline}, aided by repeated cyberattacks on
government institutions, [was instrumental in]{.underline} the
[2016]{.underline} Moscow-sponsored coup attempt [in
Montenegro]{.underline}. In North Macedonia, Russia spread
disinformation prior to the name-change referendum that finally enabled
North Macedonia to join NATO. It also established hundreds of North
Macedonia-based "troll factories,\" from which Russia pedaled fake news
against the 2016 U.S. elections. Facebook recently banned troll farms
from North Macedonia that pushed COVID-19 disinformation. 

Moscow has also been investing in critical sectors in Croatia. With its
strategy of fomenting political divisions, the Kremlin has been
exploiting internal conflicts in Albania. In Bosnia and Herzegovina,
disinformation campaigns have sown ethnic and religious discord,
while promoting the secession of ethnic Serb regions from Bosnia. In
response, the U.S. should encourage the transatlantic integration for
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Western Balkans' most fragile country. 

Russia has used state-sponsored media to promote nationalist and
anti-Western narratives in Serbia, including the opening of
a Sputnik office in Belgrade. Also,  Russian-run "Humanitarian
Center" in Serbia is very close to the main NATO based in Kosovo (Camp
Bondsteel). Some European and American officials fear that it serves as
a base for the Kremlin intelligence-gathering activities to eavesdrop on
U.S. interests in the Balkans. 

[Russia's]{.underline} preeminent [goals in the Balkans have been to
refine their disinformation tactics and erode Western influence in the
region]{.underline}, including in Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia
and Albania, which are all NATO members. [The West needs to aggressively
respond to this Russian posture, including using a cyber-focused
campaign to counter Russia\'s provocations. ]{.underline}

For crafting such a strategy, [the West should look to
Estonia]{.underline}. After the 2007 Russian cyberattack on Estonian
government institutions, [Estonia became a global leader in
cybersecurity and home to the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of
Excellence, which is a cyber-defense hub that supports member nations
with cyber-defense expertise]{.underline}. A similar approach by the
West would benefit the Western Balkans, where information and
communication technology sector is the most promising and the fastest
growing economic sector in the region. In Serbia alone, the I.T. sector
generates more than 10% of GDP with a similar trend in other countries
in the region, which have some of the highest numbers of outsourced I.T.
workers per capita in Europe. 

[An]{.underline} [American-led strategy should focus on creating
a]{.underline} [regional cyber-security infrastructure]{.underline} in
the Western Balkans, [modeled on Estonia\'s example]{.underline}. Given
that countries in the Western Balkans share the same cyber-security
threats from Russia and, more recently, from China, [a regional hub for
cybersecurity would allow states to cooperate among each other in cyber
deterrence, attribution of attacks and collective
countermeasures]{.underline}. 

Several countries [in the Western Balkans]{.underline} have joined NATO,
but [alliances are]{.underline} notoriously [unreliable]{.underline},
especially among the smaller states. [Countries in the Western Balkans
need strong NATO]{.underline} and E.U. [ties to withstand Russian
influence. Cyber-security is one of the areas where they can strengthen
their positions in allegiance with the western
democracies.]{.underline} 

[The timing is excellent for the U.S. to establish a regional
cyber-security hub in the Western Balkans. Immediate steps need to be
taken to halt malign Russian influence.]{.underline} With elections
approaching this year in the U.S., North Macedonia, Croatia and
Montenegro, [countries should continue cooperating to counter malicious
Russian cyber activities. ]{.underline}

[The U.S. can]{.underline} learn more about Russian cyber tactics at the
same time. One way to send a strong message would be to [deploy a
cyber-team to strengthen NATO's countries' cyber-capabilities in an
effort to thwart future Russian network intrusions]{.underline} such as
the one that was undertaken by Russian intelligence operators in
Bulgaria in 2017. 

Serbia, a key ally to Moscow in the region, remains the biggest obstacle
to countering Russian influence. Serbia just had parliamentary elections
boycotted by the opposition that resulted in Vucic\'s Serbian
Progressive party winning a landslide victory and further strengthening
his power. The close Russia-Serbian relationship can make it difficult
to detect Russia\'s subversive activities. 

Of all the Western Balkans countries, Serbia had the highest military
expenditure in 2019, and President Vucic thanked Russia for making
Serbia's military 10 times stronger since NATO intervention in 1999.
After Russia employed an S-400 missile system in Serbia for a military
drill, the Pantsir S1 air-defense systems were delivered this past
February, despite a looming U.S. sanctions threat.  

Should Serbia continue obtaining Russian weapons, Washington should
impose sanctions. Serbia must understand that its strategy of neutrality
is unacceptable to the U.S., as are its claims to balance their
interests among Russia, China and the West. [The U.S. should remain
solidly committed]{.underline}, leading efforts to solve the Kosovo
dispute and wrest control of that narrative from Russia. 

While variances in the national interests may complicate cooperation
among the Western Balkan [countries]{.underline}, they [share similar
vital objectives that make cooperation possible and]{.underline} even
[attractive under U.S. leadership]{.underline}. Among these are the
historical fear of Russian domination and a desire for E.U. and NATO
membership. [A U.S.-led strategy with NATO country participation to
enhance their cyber-capabilities will improve their security in
countering nefarious Russian influence while enhancing cooperation
between Balkan nations. ]{.underline}

[Moscow is determined to expand its influence]{.underline} in the
Western Balkans, [using cyber-warfare at the expense of U.S. and western
interests. To prevent it, the U.S. should design a new
strategy]{.underline} for the Western Balkans [that demonstrates that
the U.S. is committed to countering Russia\'s disruptive
activities]{.underline} in the Western Balkans and beyond. The time for
that response is now.

# Add-Ons

## DOD Innovation 

### Add-On\-\--DoD Innovation\-\--2AC

#### Countering adversaries' disinformation solves [DoD innovation]{.underline}. 

Sydney **Litterer 22**, Research Assistant at the RAND Corporation; and
Krista Romita Grocholski, physical scientist at the RAND Corporation,
4/22/2022, \"Effective Use of Nonlethal Weapons Could Require Combating
Disinformation,\" No Publication,
https://www.rand.org/blog/2022/04/effective-use-of-nonlethal-weapons-could-require-combating.html,
RMax

In an era of strategic competition, nonlethal [weapons can]{.underline}
potentially [bolster]{.underline} U.S. Department of Defense [(DoD)
capabilities]{.underline}. The [temporary and reversible effects
of]{.underline} these [weapons can provide DoD with]{.underline} an
[appropriate response to provocations that don\'t merit]{.underline} the
use of [lethal force, reducing]{.underline} the potential for
[collateral damage while mitigating]{.underline} the [risk of
inadvertent escalation in peacetime and gray-zone
situations]{.underline}.

[Public perceptions]{.underline} can [have powerful effects on
how]{.underline} these [systems are employed and the impact of their
use. Understanding these factors, and]{.underline} particularly [the
potential for negative narratives]{.underline} emerging from the use of
novel technologies [could be vital for DoD as it develops
innovative]{.underline} nonlethal [weapons because]{.underline} the
[technologies]{.underline} they rely on [may be poorly
understood]{.underline} by the general public.

The Joint Intermediate Force Capabilities Office, which oversees
nonlethal weapons for DoD, is already conducting proactive public
outreach to ensure that the new and useful nonlethal weapons it develops
don\'t become the object of public misperceptions. However, these
[efforts]{.underline} may [need to be bolstered to effectively
counter]{.underline} the spread of [disinformation when]{.underline}
nonlethal [weapons are employed in contentious situations. DoD might
consider whether pre-emptive]{.underline}, [large-scale
public-information efforts or focused counterdisinformation
campaigns]{.underline} [could effectively address the risk of
controversies]{.underline} stemming [from inaccurate
information]{.underline} regarding nonlethal weapons. After all, [if a
weapon is too controversial]{.underline} to use, [its technical
capabilities are irrelevant.]{.underline}

This issue is far from hypothetical. For example, [DoD has]{.underline}
a nonlethal, directed-energy weapon---the [Active Denial System
(ADS)]{.underline}---[that uses a beam of millimeter]{.underline} waves
[to create an intense heating sensation that goes away as soon as a
person leaves the beam]{.underline}. Millimeter waves are incapable of
penetrating beyond the outermost layer of skin, so their effects are
superficial and do not cause long-term damage. Nevertheless, [ADS has
been the subject of]{.underline} a great deal of
[controversy]{.underline}. Because most people outside of DoD are
unfamiliar with millimeter waves, perceptions that DoD has developed a
"heat ray" meant to microwave people have gained traction. ADS is also
sometimes brought up in discussions of "Havana syndrome," a type of
brain damage potentially caused by microwave attacks, even though its
effects are temporary and entirely different. [This controversy may
inhibit the deployment of ADS]{.underline}, despite its proven safety
record and impressive efficacy.

[Expanding]{.underline} public-information [efforts to address
controversies surrounding novel technologies]{.underline} like ADS
[could be important as the United States engages with]{.underline}
near-peer [competitors like Russia and China, who both recognize the
power of narratives in shaping competition and conflict]{.underline}. In
particular, [Russia\'s]{.underline} recent [use of disinformation to
justify]{.underline} its invasion of [Ukraine is but one facet of its
extensive engagement in information operations]{.underline}. RAND
research describes these efforts as a "firehose of falsehood," in which
[Russia uses]{.underline} traditional and social [media]{.underline}
channels [to flood foreign audiences with unreliable information that
exploits]{.underline} existing [societal tensions to
increase]{.underline} feelings of [alienation]{.underline} among
Russian-speaking populations in neighboring countries and introduce
social and political instability more broadly. [Portraying U.S. and NATO
actions as aggressive]{.underline} and escalatory contributes to both
aims---and [has been a key component of Russian rhetoric]{.underline} in
recent days. [In future gray zone conflicts, where other nations can
take advantage of ambiguity]{.underline} and misdirection while using
purported civilians as proxies (and the United States may face
significant incentives to avoid escalation), [use of new]{.underline}
nonlethal [weapons may provide fertile ground for disinformation by U.S.
rivals]{.underline}.

All of this is already possible for nations skilled in information
operations, and, as the COVID-19 pandemic has made abundantly clear,
[disinformation spreads like wildfire]{.underline}. Acknowledging that
DoD may not be the only arbiter of how these weapons are perceived could
be critical. Furthermore, what\'s unknown is easily demonized, and
what\'s demonized may never be used and thus remains unknown.

[If DoD wants to introduce novel capabilities]{.underline} that
commanders feel comfortable using, [it could work to ensure that its
current public outreach efforts aren\'t undone by the unopposed spread
of disinformation]{.underline} during a crisis. [Taking
this]{.underline} risk [seriously could mean exploring how large-scale,
pre-emptive public-information efforts or responsive
counterdisinformation]{.underline} campaigns coul[d prevent adversaries
from turning U.S. forces\' use of nonlethal weapons against
them]{.underline} in the realm of public opinion. [Addressing the
problem could enable U.S. forces to use]{.underline} nonlethal [weapons
confidently and successfully to reduce casualties and achieve narrative
dominance.]{.underline}

VIII\. CONCLUSION

[Innovation Warfare is a competitive strategy prosecuted by nation
states against the innovation infrastructure of the U.S. Innovation
Warfare is a means to a geopolitical end and does not constitute
economic competition as usual. Countries engaging in Innovation Warfare
pose]{.underline} both [a national security and economic
risk]{.underline} to the United States [because those countries threaten
the innovation ecosystem at the root of]{.underline} economic [power and
prosperity]{.underline}, and at the root of military technological
superiority.

[China is]{.underline} currently [prosecuting an Innovation
Warfare]{.underline} competitive strategy [against the United
States]{.underline}. As documented and described herein,
[there]{.underline} currently [exists a comprehensive, coordinated
effort by China to]{.underline} acquire U.S. technology and to
[co-opt]{.underline} the [U.S. innovation]{.underline} base for its own
purposes. [A future in which China prevails in the Innovation Warfare
"fight" is one in which the United States cedes the technological future
to another, and one in which its geopolitical power and the prosperity
of its citizens is at risk. The danger presented by China's Innovation
Warfare]{.underline} tactics [is]{.underline} also [an existential
one]{.underline}.

A technological future dictated by Chinese interests is unlikely to
incorporate western values of privacy and personal liberties into that
technology. [Innovation Warfare]{.underline} thus [constitutes a threat
against which the United States must defend]{.underline} itself.
Development and [execution of an Innovation Warfare counterstrategy
are]{.underline} therefore [critical to protecting the national security
and economic interests of the United States and negating
the]{.underline} type of economic and [geopolitical aggression
that]{.underline} previously [led to two World Wars. Executing a
counterstrategy]{.underline} not only [preserves the peace]{.underline}
but ensures [that]{.underline} peace [is one in which American
welfare]{.underline} and liberties [remain intact]{.underline}. There
are four things the United States must do to execute an effective
counterstrategy. These four things are:

1)  Future-Oriented Technology Intelligence -- Develop machine learning
    tools to identify the possible technological futures and drive
    towards the preferred future(s);

2)  Strategic Technology Development -- Optimize and scope federal R&D
    spending to seed the innovations necessary to attain the preferred
    future(s);

3)  Secure Technology Control Positions -- Identify and secure control
    positions along the preferred future technology implementation path,
    including deploying and protecting intellectual property as an
    armament in the Innovation Warfare battlespace; and

4)  Organize to Win -- Develop the cross-functional capabilities and
    inter-organizational coordination both within the government and
    across the public-private interface.

[Innovation Warfare]{.underline} distilled down to its most basic truth
[is a footrace to control the technological future]{.underline}. FTA
[capabilities are]{.underline} thus [vital]{.underline} not just [to
winning]{.underline}, but [also to defining the mileposts]{.underline}
along the racecourse. Future [investments]{.underline} in FTA
capabilities [will be critical to overtake the lead]{.underline} others
have built in this field. One cannot influence the attainment of a
future one cannot see, or which others can see well in advance. In a
world where others have advanced FTA capabilities, it will be difficult
to optimize research into new technologies with equivalent speed and
insightfulness absent those investments.

[The capabilities necessary to implement]{.underline} the remaining
elements of [the Innovation Warfare counterstrategy]{.underline} already
exist but [must be marshalled and aligned with strategic
goals]{.underline}. In particular, the government, and specifically [the
D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense, [should
work to expand its]{.underline} intellectual property [portfolios and
align them with Innovation Warfare objectives]{.underline}. Intellectual
property constitutes a crucial armament in the Innovation Warfare
battlespace. Intellectual property establishes control positions along
the racecourse to the technological future(s). According to the
principles of strategic openness, these control positions can be gated
open to encourage technology adoption, or gated closed to prevent it.
Deft use of advanced licensing techniques employs these principles to
manage the established control positions and ensures that the
technological future arrived at is the one preferred.

Each of these enumerated counterstrategy elements stands not alone but
works in concert with the others. Leadership must organize nationally
and at the agency levels to synchronize these efforts. Agencies with
strong research portfolios, such as the Department of Defense and
Department of Energy, will require a designated leader or function to
coordinate the intellectual property and control position aspects of the
counterstrategy across various internal stakeholders. This functionality
can be achieved by appointing a CIPO or by expanding the
responsibilities of existing personnel. Within the Department of
Defense, it may additionally be possible to designate one department,
for example, the Navy, as the lead executive agency with overall
responsibility for implementing the counterstrategy. Sufficient
statutory authority exists to execute the Innovation Warfare
counterstrategy and organizational design, without the need for
additional legislation or rulemaking.

[Innovation Warfare]{.underline} may exist in the gray area between
peace and war, but it nonetheless [is a conflict the United States must
win]{.underline}.

**CSC 21**, The United States Cyberspace Solarium Commission, December
2021, \"Cyberspace Solarium Commission,\" No Publication,
<https://www.solarium.gov/public-communications/disinformation-white-paper>

[INTRODUCTION -- WHY DISINFORMATION IS A CYBERSPACE ISSUE]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} United States Cyberspace Solarium Commission [(CSC)
was created by Congress]{.underline} in the National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019 [to answer two fundamental
questions: What]{.underline} strategic [approach will defend the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [against
cyberattacks]{.underline} of significant consequences? [And what
policies and legislation are required to implement that]{.underline}
strategy? [While disinformation is considered by some an
issue]{.underline} largely [separate from cybersecurity]{.underline} or
network security,1 the Commission addressed disinformation in the very
narrow context of elections in its final report in March 2020. As the
COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe, [the Commission]{.underline}
revisited the issue, this time in the context of disinformation about
the pandemic itself, [not]{.underline}ing, "[Our adversaries'
disinformation campaigns]{.underline} focused on the pandemic
[illustrate that disinformation]{.underline} activities [can reach far
beyond the political and electoral contexts]{.underline} with which
Americans are best acquainted."2

Over the course of the intervening months, [the Commission received
demand signals from]{.underline} constituents within
[Congress]{.underline} and the executive branch [to treat the topic of
disinformation]{.underline} and potential policy recommendations [more
extensively]{.underline}. The Commission has previously been reluctant
to delve deeply into the topic of disinformation for two reasons.

First, disinformation as a policy issue, unlike many aspects of
cybersecurity policy, has been marked by a strong partisan divide.
Researchers have identified an association between strong partisanship
and vulnerability to misinformation;3 more than two-thirds of U.S.
citizens believe that Republicans and Democrats disagree about basic
facts;4 and while U.S. citizens in both major parties agree that
disinformation is a problem, they disagree about who is responsible for
it and what ways to tackle the threat are appropriate.5 Although this
partisan divide persists today, it is the sense of the members of the
Commission that there is room to reach some agreement on core issues.

Second, as noted above, [disinformation is seen by many as]{.underline}
an issue largely [separate from cybersecurity]{.underline} and cyber
policy in the United States. While the Commission understands this view,
[continuing to bifurcate these issues has become untenable]{.underline}.
From a strategic perspective, [the United States]{.underline} and its
policymakers [do themselves a disservice by continuing to differentiate
between the two when our adversaries do not]{.underline}.6

In order to craft a comprehensive strategy to defend the United States
from cyberattacks of significant consequence, [policy-makers must
account for the entire arsenal employed by adversaries to cause harm in
cyberspace, including information]{.underline}. It is also important to
take a more operational or risk management perspective: [disinformation
campaigns waged against the United States]{.underline} by foreign actors
[are often carried out]{.underline} by many of the same threat actors as
are active [in cyberspace and are often the consequence of
cyberattacks]{.underline}.

For these reasons, members of the Commission believe that elements of
the topic of disinformation are within our mandate. [This]{.underline}
white [paper is the result of]{.underline} [deep research, interviews
with experts, and deliberations by the Commission]{.underline}. It seeks
to explain how the Commission's proposed strategy of layered cyber
deterrence applies to combating disinformation and contributes a set of
policy recommendations to better position the United States to prevent,
counter, and withstand the consequences of disinformation launched
against it.

#### Countering disinformation [is]{.underline} cybersecurity\-\--terrain, tactics, targets, and temptations prove. The EU votes aff.

**DisinfoLab 21** -- The EU DisinfoLab, 5/24/2021, \"Why Disinformation
is a Cybersecurity Threat,\" EU DisinfoLab,
<https://www.disinfo.eu/advocacy/why-disinformation-is-a-cybersecurity-threat/>,
RMax

Context: Why [Disinformation is a Cybersecurity Issue]{.underline}

Drawing on our research into coordinated disinformation campaigns and
our own experience as an NGO in the field, we wish to highlight [four
areas of convergence between disinformation and
cybersecurity]{.underline} of relevance to EU policymakers: [the
"terrain" on which disinformation is distributed (the social web
and]{.underline} the [internet stack, networking infrastructure, routing
services]{.underline}), [the "tactics" that increasingly combine
disinformation as part of the cyberattack delivery package, the
"targets" leading to victims of cyberattacks simultaneously being victim
of disinformation, and]{.underline} what we could call [the
"temptation",]{.underline} ie. [the lucrative possibility of both
disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks]{.underline}.

[Terrain:]{.underline} While there is much focus on disinformation
across major social media platforms, [disinformation is an inherently
distributed phenomenon]{.underline}. [Disinformation campaigns continue
to make use of networking infrastructure and routing services,
leveraging]{.underline} different levels of [the internet
stack]{.underline}. As EU DisinfoLab's  recent investigations have
demonstrated, [social media]{.underline} platforms often [serve as
gateways and amplifiers of disinformation websites]{.underline}. In this
way, [disinformation and cybersecurity implicate many of the same
members of the private sector and the internet technical
community]{.underline}. 

[Tactics: There is significant overlap between disinformation and
cybersecurity regarding the tools and methods of attack]{.underline}.
[Disinformation is increasingly part of the cyberattack delivery
package, used to deliver malware by manipulating people's fears and
heightened emotions]{.underline} (for instance the deployment of
"fearware", a subset of phishing lures that rose in prominence during
the pandemic and rely on anxieties and informational deficits). The
continuous proliferation of hack and leak operations as well as the
coordination between hybrid tactics (illustrated in the Sandworm case)
demonstrates this convergence. There is also significant convergence
between disinformation campaigns and the  tactics used in cybercrime,
for example, via illegal dark web transactions, illegally obtained
documents, and various kinds of fraud.

[Targets: Disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks can cause similar
harms and are sometimes combined to reach the same targets]{.underline}.
While [a data breach can compromise information security]{.underline},
[so can the manipulation of data]{.underline}. We saw an example of this
related to Covid-19 vaccines early this year, when hackers stole
confidential documents from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) a
European Union regulatory body to  seow mistrust in the Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccine. Meanwhile, so-called "anti-democracy attacks" and "cyber
influencing attacks" like media manipulation and astroturfing in the
context of elections illustrate the hybrid nature of interference in
democratic processes. 

[Temptations: Hacking, cybercrime and influence operations are lucrative
endeavors]{.underline}, often [outsourced to skilled
professionals]{.underline}. While individuals and businesses may have

cybersecurity issue**]{.mark} as well.]{.underline}

Text: On February 16, 2018, U.S. Department of Justice Special Counsel
Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russians for interfering in the 2016 United
States presidential election \[1\]. Beyond the important legal and
political ramifications of this event, this indictment should make one
thing clear: information warfare is a cybersecurity issue.

It shouldn't be surprising that Russia created fake social media
profiles to spread disinformation on sites like Facebook. This tactic
had been demonstrated for some time, and the Russians have done this in
numerous other countries as well\[2\]. Instead, what's noteworthy about
the investigation's findings, is that Russian hackers also stole the
identities of real American citizens to spread disinformation\[3\].
Whether the Russian hackers compromised accounts through technical
hacking, social engineering, or other means, this technique proved
remarkably effective; masquerading as American citizens lent
significantly greater credibility to trolls (who purposely sow discord
on the Internet) and bots (automated information-spreaders) that pushed
Russian narratives.

Information warfare has traditionally been viewed as an issue of
fact-checking or information filtering, which it certainly still is
today. Nonetheless, traditional information warfare was conducted before
the advent of modern cyber technologies, which have greatly changed the
ways in which information campaigns are executed. Whereas historical
campaigns took time to spread information and did so through in-person
speeches or printed news articles, social media enables instantaneous,
low-cost, and scalable access to the world's populations, as does the
simplicity of online blogging and information forgery (e.g., using
software to manufacture false images). Those looking to wage information
warfare can do so with relative ease in today's digital world.

The effectiveness of modern information warfare, then, is heavily
dependent upon the security of these technologies and platforms -- or,
in many cases, the total lack thereof. In this situation, the success of
the Russian hackers was propelled by the average U.S. citizen's
ignorance of basic cyber "hygiene" rules, such as strong password
creation. If cybersecurity mechanisms hadn't failed to keep these
hackers out, Russian "agents of influence" would have gained access to
far fewer legitimate social media profiles -- making their overall
campaign significantly less effective.

To be clear, this is not to blame the campaign's effectiveness on
specific end users; with over 100,000 Facebook accounts hacked every
single day we can imagine it wouldn't be difficult for any other country
to use this same technique\[4\]. However, it's important to understand
the relevance of cybersecurity here. User access control, strong
passwords, mandated multi-factor authentication, fraud detection, and
identity theft prevention were just some of the cybersecurity best
practices that failed to combat Russian disinformation just as much as
fact-checking mechanisms or counter-narrative strategies.

[These **[technical and behavioral failures]{.mark}** didn't just
[compromise]{.mark} the integrity of information, a **[pillar of
cybersecurity]{.mark}**;]{.underline} they also enabled the campaign to
become incredibly more effective. [As the hackers planned to **[exploit
the]{.mark} polarized [election environment]{.mark},** access to
American profiles made this far easier: by **[manipulating]{.mark}** and
distorting **[info]{.mark}**rmation **[to]{.mark} make it [seem
legitimate]{.mark}**]{.underline} (i.e., opinions coming from actual
Americans), these Russians **[[undermined law]{.mark} enforcement
[operations,]{.mark} [election
processes]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} and more. [We are quick to
ask: how much of this information was correct and how much of it wasn't?
**Who can tell whether the information originated from un-compromised,
credible sources** or from credible sources that have actually been
hacked?]{.underline}

[However, we should also consider another angle: what if the hackers
hadn't won access to those American profiles in the first place? What if
the hackers were forced to almost entirely use fraudulent accounts,
which are prone to be detected by Facebook's algorithms? It is for these
reasons that **[info]{.mark}rmation [warf]{.mark}are [is]{.mark}** so
**[critical for cybersecurity]{.mark}**, and why **[Russian
info]{.mark}rmation [war]{.mark}fare campaigns of the past [cannot
be]{.mark}** equally **[compared]{.mark} to** the **digital
info**rmation **wars** of the modern era.]{.underline}

The global cybersecurity community can take an even greater, active role
in addressing the account access component of disinformation.
Additionally, those working on information warfare and other narrative
strategies could leverage cybersecurity for defensive operations.
Without a coordinated and integrated effort between these two sectors of
the cyber and security communities, the inability to effectively combat
disinformation will only continue as false information penetrates our
social media feeds, news cycles, and overall public discourse.

More than ever, a demand signal is present to educate the world's
citizens on cyber risks and basic cyber "hygiene," and to even mandate
the use of multi-factor authentication, encrypted Internet connections,
and other critical security features. The security of social media and
other mass-content-sharing platforms has become an information warfare
issue, both within respective countries and across the planet as a
whole. When rhetoric and narrative can spread (or at least appear to
spread) from within, the effectiveness of a campaign is amplified. The
cybersecurity angle of information warfare, in addition to the
misinformation, disinformation, and rhetoric itself, will remain
integral to effectively combating the propaganda and narrative campaigns
of the modern age.

#### **EU 21,** Official EU document citing 2016 Cybersecurity Strategy, "[Why [Disinformation is a Cybersecurity Threat]{.mark}]{.underline}," https://www.disinfo.eu/advocacy/why-disinformation-is-a-cybersecurity-threat//

Overview

The EU's "[Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade" is a
compelling attempt to link the various foreign, digital, penal, and
economic dimensions of the EU's cybersecurity strategy, it is therefore
essential that **disinformatio**n be **firmly included** in this
frame]{.underline}. Especially now. Over the course of the Coronavirus
pandemic, [**disinformation and cyberattacks have grown in parallel,**
exposing existing fragilities and novel risks.]{.underline} For
end-users and cybersecurity professionals, the [growing attack surface
and the growing quantity of data make distinguishing safe and unsafe
content more difficult.]{.underline} Meanwhile it remains all too easy
to [create and maintain assets for **cybercrime** and disinformation
campaigns]{.underline} (single-use email addresses, fraudulent domains
and accounts, etc.). [The EU's Cybersecurity Strategy must show an
evolved understanding of what constitutes abusive and illegal
behavior]{.underline}. [**The EU should recognise** [high-impact]{.mark}
coordinated **[disinfo]{.mark}**rmation campaigns **[as]{.mark} [cyber
attacks.]{.mark}**]{.underline} This recognition will allow it to
establish the frameworks needed for effective attribution and
dissuasion, first and foremost by improving information sharing and
situational awareness among stakeholders from both the disinformation
and cybersecurity fields, as well as governments, the private sector,
and the technical community.

Context: Why Disinformation is a Cybersecurity Issue

Drawing on our research into coordinated disinformation campaigns and
our own experience as an NGO in the field, we wish to highlight four
areas of convergence between disinformation and cybersecurity of
relevance to EU policymakers: the "terrain" on which disinformation is
distributed (the social web and the internet stack, networking
infrastructure, routing services), the "tactics" that increasingly
combine disinformation as part of the cyberattack delivery package, the
"targets" leading to victims of cyberattacks simultaneously being victim
of disinformation, and what we could call the "temptation", ie. the
lucrative possibility of both disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks.

Terrain: While there is much focus on disinformation across major social
media platforms, disinformation is an inherently distributed phenomenon.
Disinformation campaigns continue to make use of networking
infrastructure and routing services, leveraging different levels of the
internet stack. As EU DisinfoLab's recent investigations have
demonstrated, social media platforms often serve as gateways and
amplifiers of disinformation websites. In this way, disinformation and
cybersecurity implicate many of the same members of the private sector
and the internet technical community.

Tactics: There is significant overlap between disinformation and
cybersecurity regarding the tools and methods of attack. Disinformation
is increasingly part of the cyberattack delivery package, used to
deliver malware by manipulating people's fears and heightened emotions
(for instance the deployment of "fearware", a subset of phishing lures
that rose in prominence during the pandemic and rely on anxieties and
informational deficits). The continuous proliferation of hack and leak
operations as well as the coordination between hybrid tactics
(illustrated in the Sandworm case) demonstrates this convergence. There
is also significant convergence between disinformation campaigns and the
tactics used in cybercrime, for example, via illegal dark web
transactions, illegally obtained documents, and various kinds of fraud.

[Targets: **[Disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks]{.mark}** can
cause similar harms and are sometimes combined to [reach the same
targets]{.mark}**. [While a data breach can compromise information
security, so can]{.mark} the [manipulation]{.mark} of
data.**]{.underline} We saw an example of this related to Covid-19
vaccines early this year, [when **[hackers stole confidential
documents]{.mark}** from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) a European
Union regulatory body **[to sow mistrust]{.mark}** in the
Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.]{.underline} [Meanwhile, so-called
"anti-democracy attacks" and "[cyber]{.mark} influencing
[attacks]{.mark}" like media manipulation and astroturfing in the
context of elections **[illustrate the hybrid nature]{.mark}** of
interference in democratic processes.]{.underline}

Temptations: Hacking, cybercrime and influence operations are lucrative
endeavors, often outsourced to skilled professionals. [While individuals
and businesses may have increased their readiness for ransomware
attacks, [disinfo]{.mark}rmation [strategies]{.mark} like defamation and
extortion are now being used to [cause reputational damage]{.mark} and
seek profit]{.underline}. These activities all have strong financial
incentives and as yet insufficient consequences, due in part to the
challenges of attribution but also to the lack of dissuasive/restrictive
measures.

Saj **Huq 20,** leads cyber innovation at Plexal and is director of
Lorca, the London Office for Rapid Cybersecurity Advancement, "It's time
to accept that disinformation is a cyber security issue," Computer
Weekly, 12/23/2020,
https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Its-time-to-accept-that-disinformation-is-a-cyber-security-issue

The internet, as life-changing as it can be for digitising businesses,
connecting communities and informing individuals, doesn't come with a
user guide to help us navigate it. And as people become more aware of
the dark side of the web, they are looking for tools that help to defend
them against campaigns designed to manipulate how they think or behave.

[**[Mis]{.mark}**information **[and disinformation]{.mark}** are rife,
but so far it's been **[seen as a challenge]{.mark}** for policy-makers
and big tech, including social media platforms]{.underline}. However,
because disinformation is by nature an online risk, it is a [challenge
**[for our cyber security]{.mark}** ecosystem to tackle,
too.]{.underline}

But tackling the manipulation of truth is no easy task. [The sheer
volume of data being created makes it hard to tell what's real and
what's not.]{.underline} From destroying 5G towers to conspiracies like
QAnon and unfounded concern about election fraud, distrust is becoming
the default -- and this [**[can have incredibly damaging
effects]{.mark}** on society.]{.underline}

[**Disinfo**rmation and **fake news** is also part of the delivery
package, rather than being the end goal -- it **is increasingly [being
used to deliver malware]{.mark}** by **[manipulating]{.mark}** people's
**[fears]{.mark}** and heightened emotions.]{.underline} [For example,
Avast has found that **[fake shops claiming to sell Covid-19
cures]{.mark}** that use the World Health Organization's logo were
**intended to [get people to download malware.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

So far, the tech sector -- primarily social media companies, given that
their platforms enable fake news to spread exponentially -- have tried
to implement some measures, with varying levels of success. For example,
WhatsApp has placed a stricter limit on its message-forwarding
capability and Twitter has begun to flag misleading posts.

Despite these efforts, reports stressing concerns about the issue from
intelligence services and independent committees are being overlooked,
while policies can't be put in place fast enough to keep up with the
ever-changing ways that fake news spreads. But it's not just an issue of
having more laws -- in fact, too much regulation in some cases can be
used as a guise for clamping down on free speech. We should be very wary
of overusing it as a tool.

We are also seeing the rise of tech startups that are exploring ways to
detect and stem the flow of disinformation, such Right of Reply,
Astroscreen and Logically. These companies don't tend to refer to
themselves as cyber security companies, but you can argue that this is,
in effect, what they are.

[[**It's a question of definitions**:]{.mark} **if we agree that cyber
security isn't just about data breaches** but data integrity, then it's
clear that **these companies come under the umbrella of
security**]{.underline}**.**

[More than that, **[disinformation]{.mark} has the potential to
[undermine national security]{.mark}** -- and it **[should be at the
core of]{.mark}** our **[cyber defence]{.mark}s.**]{.underline}

However, the cyber security innovation ecosystem as a whole has been
under-utilised and under-motivated to play a role in this landscape.
Plenty of spinouts and startups have the tools to combat disinformation
and take on botnets, such as automated threat detection, but don't
regard stemming the flow of disinformation to be in their domain.

This will change as businesses increasingly become the target of
disinformation, which will create more market demand among IT teams. We
are seeing cyber espionage techniques such as creating fake news to hold
influential members of a competitor company ransom or damage the
reputation of a brand, and this will shift our perception of the
challenge as it becomes more rife in the corporate world.

Data breaches result in the loss of value, but so can data manipulation.
This reflects the changing nature of cyber security at large -- it's now
more about protecting an enterprise's values, brand and reputation
rather than just a network security issue.

Disinformation is still an emerging frontier for cyber security, and we
will need unconventional techniques far beyond data breach notifications
and regulatory fines. New alliances and partnerships must emerge between
industry and government. More than that, our fundamental assumptions of
what a cyber attack looks like must also evolve

[But **[the first step is recognising it as]{.mark}** a new type of
online risk where effective **[cyber security]{.mark}** is part of the
solution.]{.underline}

[According to a report by the Institute for Public Relations, 63% of
Americans view **disinformation** as **a major problem** in
society,]{.underline} yet there are limited avenues to combat it outside
of media literacy and news spaces \[1\]. similarly, a report by Neustar

[cybersecurity professionals think of disinfo]{.mark}rmation [as a
threat]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} of which **49%** say the threat is **very
significant**]{.underline}. The study also found that 91% of
cybersecurity professionals thought that stricter measures should be
implemented on the Internet \[2\]. [**The [gravity of the

[[The State Department\'s]{.underline} [counter-propaganda

[report on]{.underline} [Russian disinformation]{.underline} [in Africa
as]{.underline} the Joe [Biden]{.underline} administration [looks to
expose the Kremlin following]{.underline} the invasion of
[Ukraine]{.underline}.

[[The]{.mark} [G]{.mark}lobal]{.underline}
[[E]{.mark}ngagement]{.underline} [[C]{.mark}entre]{.underline}, which
leads and coordinates US efforts to "recognize, understand, expose, and
counter foreign propaganda and disinformation", released a three-page
bulletin on Russian activities on 24 May. The report focuses
particularly on Mali and other Sahel countries where the Kremlin-linked
Wagner Group of mercenaries operates.

"Russia deploys disinformation across different continents for varied
objectives, often working through tested proxies to support Kremlin
foreign policy objectives indirectly, which provides a level of
deniability," the report states. "In some parts of Africa -- including,
most recently, Mali -- Kremlin-linked proxies exploit instability to
gain influence, particularly through disinformation and the deployment
of the Wagner Group forces."

A spokesperson for the State Department describes the report as "part of
the State Department's overall public exposure efforts to counter
Russian disinformation".

"We are releasing these substantive products to the public to counter
Russia's false narratives and propaganda with reporting that shines the
light on Kremlin lies," the spokesperson tells The Africa Report. "This
bulletin is our first on Russia's disinformation efforts in Africa."

[The US military's approach to information warfare relies on personnel,
organizations, techniques, and procedures grounded in conventional
doctrine.]{.underline}1 [When it comes to]{.underline} tactical
[information operations, instead of doing what the Joint force needs
them to do, US military]{.underline} members [do what they know how to
do. This]{.underline} reality [leaves combatant commanders at a
comparative disadvantage relative to foes who use the information space
to exploit a vulnerability of the United States]{.underline} while
avoiding its historic conventional military strengths.
[Winning]{.underline} in [the information domain]{.underline} today and
tomorrow [will require the D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f
[D]{.underline}efense [to acquire a new capability. In conflicts
with]{.underline} peer [competitors, clear, concise, and correct
communication is a major weapon of warfare]{.underline}.

This article advocates for a new kind of fires team to assist with this
problem. The proposed "anti-disinformation" cell would compete in the
cognitive rather than physical domain. [The Department
should]{.underline} begin to [think about force packaging that
includes]{.underline} not only traditional military hardware like ships,
aircraft, and munitions, but also [people who can help understand the
geopolitical situation and communicate in a way advantageous for US
national interests]{.underline}. Recommendations in this article are
also pertinent to civilian national security leaders as they consider
ways to respond to adversary moves and inform public opinion to help
achieve political ends.

In a prescient 1997 essay, Richard [Szafranski lays bare the
consequences of falling behind adversaries who]{.underline} attempt to
[gain information advantages]{.underline}. When a citizenry's will,
their country's technological edge, and that nation's claim to the moral
high ground are in alignment, the pursuit of the profession of arms is
useful and important. "[If]{.underline}, however, [the moral high ground
is lost, a domino effect occurs: public support is lost, the
technological high ground is lost, and the armed forces are
lost]{.underline}."2

In cyberspace, U.S. Cyber Command [(USCYBERCOM) can play an important
role in disrupting adversary disinformation campaigns. Operations such
as USCYBERCOM's campaign against the TrickBot]{.underline} botnet in the
lead up to the 2020 general election [and its]{.underline} paralysis
[\[stoppage\] of Russia's Internet Research Agency on the day of the
2018 midterms must continue for effective deterrence by
denial]{.underline}.

[Information conflict is reshaping]{.underline} the future of [cyber
conflict. If the U.S. national security]{.underline} community
[continues to focus just on the 1s and 0s, it will doom the United
States to continually suffer successful attacks against its democracy
and security]{.underline}. Similarly, [to the extent]{.underline} that
the government continues to pursue cyber conflict as a purely government
problem, as opposed to part of a broader contest involving the likes of
media outlets and internet platforms, the United States will fail to
mount the society-wide response needed to effectively deter harmful
foreign activities and better compete in this contest for information.

### 2AC\-\--DoS CP\-\--DoS Fails 

#### The DoS fails\-\--surge capacity, expeditionary capability, and flexibility limit their effectiveness.

Also, Defense responsibilities for contingency response necessitate
retaining capabilities to inform, influence, and persuade. [Even the
most robust State Department imaginable will lack the]{.underline} kind
of [surge capacity and expeditionary capability needed to respond
to]{.underline} the [crises and contingencies for which our military
prepares]{.underline}. [When the US military presence]{.underline} in a
foreign country [expands from negligible to massive, who will be
alongside]{.underline} the [operating forces]{.underline}, explaining
and making their presence palatable? [The answer is military
communicators]{.underline}. If all the military communicators went away,
no one would conduct critical inform, influence, and persuade missions
at the outset of an emergent crisis, which is why the DoD needs to
remain capable. In fact, [Defense personnel]{.underline}, as argued
above, [should continue to become more capable]{.underline}, given the
possible savings for other defense capabilities.

Further, [military leaders should be encouraged to use informational
combat power as part of their combined arms approach to prevail over our
nation's foes]{.underline}, rather than outsourcing the capability to
other parts of the government.

[The]{.underline} existing [structure and organization]{.underline} [at
DoS limits its absorptive capacity for quickly building new]{.underline}
or assuming existing [responsibilities for]{.underline} informing,
influencing, and [persuading]{.underline}. Considerably smaller than
DoD, [State personnel allocations are also less flexible]{.underline}.
Culturally, [the State Department views its primary mission as
traditional state-to-state diplomacy, not public diplomacy]{.underline},
and the public diplomacy apparatus is currently quite small.30 To become
the home for government capabilities in this area, DoS will need to
pursue organizational and cultural changes and increase or transfer
resource allocations in moderate, absorbable amounts.

V. INTERNATIONAL LAW AND INFORMATION WARFARE

This Part of the Article includes an explanation of the relevant rules
of international law that can be applied to the sphere of information
warfare. Some of these rules---for instance the Outer Space Treaty
1967---end up indirectly facilitating the conditions that support the
continuation of information warfare, leaving information warfare
unchecked under international law. On the other hand, the complex and
variegated arena of information warfare makes it challenging for
international norms and principles to regulate and control information
operations.177 For instance, [although]{.underline} the [law of
war]{.underline}, the law of [armed conflict, and IHL make attempts to
regulate]{.underline} the conduct of actors involved in [information
warfare,]{.underline} the [intangibility of]{.underline} the
[damage]{.underline} caused by information warfare [makes it difficult
for IHL to impose restrictions on information warfare]{.underline}.178

A. The Law of War

The law of war or the law of armed conflict protects civilians and
noncombatants in an armed conflict.179 Likewise, the law of war also
attempts to protect civilians from any information warfare attack. That
is, the [parties engaged in information warfare]{.underline} must [cause
no harm to the civilian population]{.underline}.180 This rule can be
applied to the activity of hacking or the disruption of any
technological transmission of an adversary state by a wager of
information warfare.181 [If such an activity harms
civilians]{.underline} in any manner---for instance in disrupting their
businesses, daily routines, etc.---[then]{.underline} such an [activity
ought to be considered illegal under IHL]{.underline} or the law of
war.182 Several other inferences can similarly be made that could ensure
protection for civilians and noncombatants.183

B. Challenges Faced by International Law in Regulating Information
Warfare

In fact, [there are many challenges faced by international
law]{.underline}, in particular by IHL or the law of war, [in regulating
information warfare]{.underline}.184 These [challenges mainly derive
from]{.underline} the [intangibility]{.underline} of the damage brought
up by information warfare. Unfortunately, because of such challenges,
[international law becomes]{.underline} paralyzed
\[[stymied]{.underline}\] in an attempt [to regulate]{.underline} or
control [the broad and complicated field of information
warfare]{.underline}.185

1\. Intangibility

The [essential challenge to international law posed by information
warfare is]{.underline} the [intangibility of]{.underline} the
[damage]{.underline} caused by the information operations instituted by
an entity against its adversary.186 [International law]{.underline}, in
particular the international law of armed conflict, [is silent
on]{.underline} any [intangible damage caused to an
adversary]{.underline} in times of war and peace.187 Therefore, [it
becomes difficult for international law to regulate]{.underline} or
restrict those [information operations]{.underline} that specifically
produce intangible damages in times of war and peace.188

## Private Sector 

### Private Sector Fails 

#### Private sector actions [fail]{.underline}. Enforcement gets [politicized]{.underline}, technical [limitations]{.underline}, perceived as [overreach]{.underline}, identification is [difficult]{.underline}, and actors [shift]{.underline} to [other platforms]{.underline} or make [new accounts.]{.underline}

On the good news side, [social media]{.underline} platforms took
[action]{.underline} and new laws [regulating
disinfo]{.underline}rmation [came into play]{.underline}. However, [many
of the laws are difficult to enforce. Actions]{.underline} taken
[by]{.underline} the [platforms]{.underline} have [not]{.underline} been
[universally welcomed]{.underline} as: they [often appear
capricious]{.underline}, may be [interfering with free
speech]{.underline}, might [not]{.underline} be [applied in]{.underline}
a [uniform non-partisan global fashion]{.underline}, may be based on
[biased algorithms,]{.underline} [afford]{.underline} the [platforms too
much power]{.underline}, [and interfere with science]{.underline}. The
[global nature of social media]{.underline}, [countering
laws]{.underline} [focused on]{.underline} freedom of
[speech]{.underline}, and [technical difficulties in
identifying]{.underline} the actual [human behind]{.underline} specific
[posts]{.underline} [effectively makes policy and law enforcement
difficult.]{.underline} From a platform perspective it is important to
note that [there is an ecology of platforms.]{.underline} [Information
or actors banned from one]{.underline} platform may [simply migrate to
another]{.underline} platform. For disinformation, it often
[simultaneously exists on multiple platforms]{.underline}---[so
banning]{.underline} [it from one is a temporary measure a]{.underline}s
it will [simply get rewritten]{.underline}, [turned into]{.underline} a
[meme]{.underline}, [or combine]{.underline}d [with other
info]{.underline}rmation [and]{.underline} then [re-appear
on]{.underline} the [platform that banned it.]{.underline} Since a
[typical user employs eight social media platforms]{.underline}, it is
relatively [easy for anyone to move disinformation between
platforms.]{.underline}

2\. FUTURES AND IMAGINATION

[The further we]{.underline} seek to [gaze into the future, the more we
have to employ]{.underline} our [imaginative]{.underline} rather than
our analytical [faculties]{.underline} because of the increased
uncertainty. Just consider science fiction literature, which often seems
to become more far-fetched the further into the future it is set. At the
same time, [[futures imagined]{.mark} on a short]{.underline}er [time
frame [can]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[be
realistic]{.underline}]{.mark}; consider the apparent prescience of some
of the works from authors like H. G. Wells (1908).

[[When we play games, we exercise]{.mark} our [ability to
imagine]{.mark} the [future]{.mark}]{.underline} because [we need to
imagine]{.underline} the [context [in which]{.mark}]{.underline} future
game [[actions]{.mark} will [take place]{.mark}]{.underline}. After
studying competitive chess players, Gary Fine (2014) concluded that
players' strategy, consisting of a series of planned moves---or 'the
line'---is the core mechanic in that game, not the moves themselves (p.
323). These 'lines' require an ability to anticipate the opponent's
strategy to construct the imagined game future.

Chess, however, is a highly abstract game and teaches us little about
contemporary strategy or politics. In his later life, political theorist
Guy [Debord attempted to amalgamate]{.underline} the [imaginative
capacities of wargaming with]{.underline} his leftist [political ideals.
His Game]{.underline} of War [set out to capture]{.underline} the
struggle between a bleak 'historical present' and [an
unattainable]{.underline} future of ['utopian imagination']{.underline}
(Galloway, 2009: pp. 151-152). Ultimately, Debord became obsessed with
'the sublimation of antagonistic desire into an abstract rulebook' and
Game of War ended up as something which looked more like chess with some
added mechanics around military logistics than a game of political
strife (Galloway, 2009: p. 28).

Perhaps Debord, and others seeking to invoke imagined futures, can learn
from Pericles of ancient Athens. Pericles was a master orator, able to
convincingly convey potential futures to spur Athenians to action. What
made Periclean futures so potent was their grounding in reality.
According to Lawrence Freedman (2013), Pericles drew 'from an existing
reality but moved beyond it' and the plausibility of a future was
'derived from its practicability' (p. 49). As an example, in cyber
security, a future where only friendly actors derive the benefits from a
technology like quantum computing seems more Debordian than Periclean.
Instead, an imagined future involving quantum computing must consider
the viability of this technology also being in the hands of hostile
actors.

When designing wargames, the key to success is to understand the purpose
of the game and the future it is intended to explore. A tactical
awareness training tool might lend itself to a chess-like design where
players can imagine 'lines' such as hopping from node to node while
penetrating a network. Conversely, [a [strategic game exploring
international political dimensions]{.mark} may
[need]{.mark}]{.underline} less of a strict rule set and instead provide
[[realistic foundations]{.mark} for players [to extrapolate]{.mark}
their own imagined [futures]{.mark}.]{.underline}

3\. FUTURES AND ANTICIPATION

As an extension of imagining futures,
[[anticipation]{.underline}]{.mark} has been [described]{.underline} by
Vincanne Adams et al. (2009) [[as]{.mark} 'an [epistemic orientation
towards]{.mark} the [future']{.mark}]{.underline} (p. 254). In other
words, [[anticipating futures involves creating knowledge]{.mark} about
the future]{.underline}, thereby [[negating
surprise]{.underline}]{.mark}. In everyday usage, 'surprise' can be used
either positively or negatively---compare a surprise birthday party to a
surprise conference paper rejection. [Wargaming is]{.underline} often
[concerned with negating negative surprises]{.underline}. David Hulse et
al. (2016) identify that a core use of modelling (closely allied to
wargaming) is understanding 'when, where and how "reducible ignorance"
can be most effectually reduced vis-a-vis anticipated surprises' (p.
41). As tools for anticipating futures, [wargames enable knowledge
creation which can]{.underline} help [reduce surprise]{.underline}.

An important aspect of anticipation is the emotion contained within
surprises. A birthday party is a pleasant surprise, while a paper
rejection is unpleasant. When it comes to drivers of human behaviour,
Roy Baumeister et al. (2007) attest that 'anticipation of emotion is
more important than the actual emotion' (p. 174). While writing a paper,
an author might contemplate the hurt associated with rejection and be
compelled to make a greater effort to write a brilliant paper.

Because of its ludic nature, [[wargaming is closely associated with
competition and]{.mark} personal performance. Wargames]{.underline}
usually [have [winners and losers]{.mark}]{.underline}; the [winners
experience joy]{.underline}, elation and satisfaction, the [losers are
disappointed]{.underline}, angry and dissatisfied. One of the insidious
features of wargaming is that players' in-game behaviour can be driven
by anticipation of these emotions, rather than reasoned actions.
However, the other side of this coin is that [[players become better
prepared]{.mark} for]{.underline} the [[future by anticipating
and]{.underline}]{.mark} eventually [[experiencing]{.mark} these
[emotions in]{.mark} the safety of [the game
environment]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Wargames]{.underline} can help
[desensitise players to the extremes of emotions contained within
surprises]{.underline}---or, indeed, other adverse experiences such as
frustration, confusion, information deficiency or
excess---[so]{.underline} that [when they encounter similar
surprises]{.underline} and emotions in real life, the [effects on their
behaviour are not as drastic.]{.underline}

4\. CYBER FUTURES

As domains of warfare have increased from two (land and sea), to three
(air), to four (cyberspace) and five (space) (NATO, 2020), wargaming has
been increasingly challenged to tackle the technological developments of
the day. Sharon Ghamari-Tabrizi (2000) writes that during the Cold War,
'the technical horizon within which future wars would be fought would
change constantly, albeit uncertainly' (p. 164). In the Cold War
context, nuclear weapons dominated wargaming scenarios, yet the
'technical horizon' did not fluctuate as wildly as game designers of the
time might have envisaged. With the benefit of hindsight, we can say
that nuclear weapons of greater yields could be delivered further and
faster in the 1980s than the 1950s, but the overall nature of these
weapons did not change, and indeed remains the same today.

[[With cyber capabilities, wargaming]{.mark} finds itself looking at
another technical horizon]{.underline}. The past 15 years have only
provided glimpses of what cyber operations might look like at full
scale---Estonia in 2007, Stuxnet in 2010 and NotPetya in 2017 are
excellent examples. [It is possible to imagine a future where cities go
dark]{.underline} as power plants are shut down at the whim of an
adversary. Indeed, such [[doom-mongering]{.underline}]{.mark} has been
[[successful at capturing]{.mark} public and [political
attention]{.mark}]{.underline}---not dissimilar from the scenarios of
the Cold War.

However, perhaps these examples are more than glimpses---do these
totemic operations represent the zenith of cyber capabilities? It is
possible to imagine a future not unlike today where cyber capabilities
are used sparingly because of their expense and their limited and
unpredictable effects.

Or perhaps both of these imagined futures are incorrect and cyber
capabilities have yet to reveal their final form. In the early 20th
century, reams of strategic thinking were expounded on the novel concept
of airpower and yet the technology that prompted this thinking was
airships, not aeroplanes--- recall that the Wright Flyer first took off
in 1903, and that Giulio Douhet's seminal The Command of the Air was not
published until 1921. Strategic thinking around cyber has similarly
boomed in the early 21st century, but cyber capabilities of the future
may make Stuxnet look like an inflatable blimp by comparison. The point
here is that it is difficult to know when, or even if, technology will
outpace strategic thinking.

5\. CYBER WARGAMING

[When imagining and anticipating cyber futures]{.underline}, the lesson
for wargaming is similar as for Wells' science fiction, Wells himself
being an avid wargamer. In The War in the Air, Wells' characterisation
of airpower was not wholly incorrect, though it was exaggerated because
the technology in the novel was swiftly superseded. In cyber wargames,
the [technical aspects of cyber capabilities should be deemphasised and
potential effects should be based on current observable
reality]{.underline} rather than unsubstantiated hype.

That is not to say that cyber wargames should ignore technology. After
all, cyber is a technical domain, not a natural one. But cyber wargames
at the strategic level should not get bogged down in the relative merits
of, say, ElGamal versus RSA encryption algorithms. Instead, the effect
'data is encrypted' would reasonably be the level of detail required for
strategy games. By focusing away from the micro-level details of
technology, [[participants]{.mark} in wargames can
[explore]{.mark}]{.underline} the [macro-level strategic and [political
reasons why]{.mark} a [cyber attack might occur and how to
respond]{.mark} to it]{.underline}, without being burdened with the
tactical minutiae of cyber security. These minutiae have their place in
attack-defence exercises and capture-the-flag events, but these types of
games do not readily lend themselves to the imaginative and anticipatory
dimensions of wargaming.

From his experience of the 2010 Schriever Wargame organised by the US
Air Force, George Foresman, former Undersecretary at the US Department
of Homeland Security, stated that 'the lessons identified \[\...\] are
not futuristic concepts' (2010: p. 8). This sentiment seems to intimate
a sweet spot for [[wargames]{.underline}]{.mark} to hit: [[create a
scenario that participants]{.underline}]{.mark} can
[[imagine]{.underline}]{.mark} as [a plausible [future]{.mark} and [from
which they]{.mark} can [anticipate and learn lessons; but avoid a
scenario]{.mark} that is [overly 'futuristic']{.mark} and which
participants relegate to the realms of science fiction]{.underline}.

For those seeking to use wargames and who want to hit that sweet spot
while avoiding the trappings of technology, a good starting point would
be to keep it simple. A game does not necessarily need intricate
graphics and advanced gameplay mechanics to be effective. For example,
sample games found in Dark Guest (Curry & Rice, 2013) or The Handbook of
Cyber Wargames (Curry & Drage, 2020) require only basic gaming
paraphernalia -- in many cases just a die. The real value comes from the
players rather than the games themselves.

In the author's own experience, a cyber strategy wargame with a moderate
degree of gaming paraphernalia has been successful at eliciting learning
moments for players (Haggman, 2019). The game in question was loosely
based on the UK National Cyber Security Strategy (HM Government, 2016)
and used a game board, cards, dice, player characters and a set of rules
to convey some limited detail about cyber security topics and dynamics.
This was less simple than a matrix game but provided very direct
discussion opportunities because players could assess the game
components. Asking players what they would add to the game was often
revealing in terms of what they understood to be important in cyber
security, at both strategic and operational levels. Moreover, because
the game was relatively easy to learn and purposely designed to be fun,
it was highly engaging for players. Overcomplication can discourage
player engagement. [[Simplicity incites imagination and
anticipation]{.underline}]{.mark}, thereby [[realising]{.mark} the
[benefits associated with wargaming futures]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[While it is]{.underline} a [common perception]{.underline} in the West
[that Russia is acting offensively, there lies [explanatory
power]{.mark}]{.underline} as well [[in
understanding]{.underline}]{.mark} that the [[Russian]{.mark}s view
their [actions as]{.mark} being [defensive]{.mark}]{.underline} in
nature. In the Russian view, [[tech]{.mark}nology [is]{.mark}
a]{.underline} particular [[method]{.mark} the [West uses to
"attack"]{.mark} it]{.underline}---but [[less for]{.mark}
inflicting]{.underline} crippling [[\[brutal\] blows
than]{.underline}]{.mark} as a way [[to spread]{.underline}]{.mark}
unacceptable [[ideas]{.mark}, norms, practices, and
behaviors]{.underline}. [[Russian intel]{.mark}ligence services
are]{.underline} increasingly [[worried about]{.underline}]{.mark} the
potential detrimental national security effects arising from [[the
internet]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact, [the vast majority]{.underline}
[of [Russian writing on info]{.mark}rmation [conflict is
defensive]{.mark} in tone and focused on]{.underline} information
[security due to their perception of]{.underline} the [global
information space as a]{.underline} serious [threat to Russian
sovereignty. The original [Russian]{.mark}]{.underline} source
government [[doc]{.mark}ument]{.underline} "Doctrine of Information
Security of the Russian Federation" [[states]{.mark} that [there
is]{.mark} a [trend in foreign media to publish biased
info]{.mark}rmation about Russian]{.underline} state [policy and that
there is discrimination against Russian]{.underline} mass
[media]{.underline}. Additionally, [they observe]{.underline} what they
perceive as [increasing pressure on]{.underline} the [Russian population
through Western propaganda]{.underline} efforts [that "erode
Russian]{.underline} traditional and spiritual and moral
[values]{.underline}."2 [The belief]{.underline} that [the West was
heavily involved in the color revolutions and]{.underline} in the [Arab
Spring, as well as with]{.underline} the protests preceding [Putin's
reelection in 2012, is a deeply held one]{.underline}. In response,
[Russia views the media]{.underline} and the internet [as tools to
defend its authoritarian state and ideology]{.underline} both at home
and abroad [through dissemination of its own views and

first consider Russian information warfare concepts before examining
three specific Russian information warfare tools.

And now [some who call themselves leftists]{.underline} (I wouldn't)
[are blaming the West for the fact that US]{.underline} President Joe
Biden [was right about Putin's intentions]{.underline}. [The argument is
well-known: NATO was slowly encircling Russia, fomenting color
revolutions in its near-abroad]{.underline}, and [ignoring the
reasonable fears of a country that had been attacked from the West in
the last century.]{.underline}

There is, of course, an element of truth here. But [saying only this is
equivalent to justifying Hitler by blaming the unjust Treaty of
Versailles]{.underline}. Worse, [it concedes that big powers have the
right to spheres of influence]{.underline}, to [which all others must
submit for the sake of global stability]{.underline}. [Putin's
assumption that i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations [is a
contest of great powers is reflected in his repeated]{.underline} [claim
that he had no choice but to intervene]{.underline} militarily in
Ukraine.

Is that true? [Is the problem really]{.underline} Ukrainian
[fascism?]{.underline} The question is better directed at Putin's
Russia. [Putin's intellectual lodestar is Ivan Ilyin]{.underline}, whose
works are back in print and given to state apparatchiks and military
conscripts. [After being expelled from the Soviet Union]{.underline} in
the early 1920s, Ilyin [advocated a Russian version of
fascism]{.underline}: the state as an organic community led by a
paternal monarch, in which freedom is knowing one's place. The purpose
of voting for Ilyin (and for Putin) is to express collective support for
the leader, not to legitimate or choose him.

Aleksandr Dugin, Putin's court-philosopher, closely follows in Ilyin's
steps, adding a postmodern garnish of historicist relativism:

"\[E\]very so-called truth is a matter of believing. So we believe in
what we do, we believe in what we say. And that is the only way to
define the truth. So we have our special Russian truth that you need to
accept. If the United States does not want to start a war, you should
recognize that \[the\] United States is not any more a unique master.
And \[with\] the situation in Syria and Ukraine, Russia says, 'No you
are not any more the boss.' That is the question of who rules the world.
Only war could decide really."

But what about the people of Syria and Ukraine? Can they also choose
their truth or are they just a battlefield for would-be world rulers?

[The idea that each "way of life" has its own truth]{.underline} is what
[endears Putin to right-wing populists like]{.underline} former US
President Donald [Trump,]{.underline} who praised Russia's invasion of
Ukraine as the act of a "genius." And the feeling is mutual: When [Putin
talks about "denazification"]{.underline} in Ukraine, we should [bear in
mind his support for]{.underline} Marine le Pen's National Rally in
France, Matteo Salvini's Lega in Italy, and other [actual neo-fascist
movements.]{.underline}

[The "Russian truth" is only a convenient myth to justify Putin's
imperial vision]{.underline}, and the best way for Europe to counter it
is to build bridges to developing and emerging countries, many of which
have a long list of justified grievances against Western colonization
and exploitation. It's not enough to "defend Europe." [The true task is
to persuade other countries that the West can offer them better choices
than Russia or China can.]{.underline} And [the only way to achieve that
is to change ourselves by ruthlessly uprooting
neo-colonialism,]{.underline} even when it comes packaged as
humanitarian help.

Are we ready to prove that in defending Europe, we are fighting for
freedom everywhere? Our disgraceful refusal to treat refugees equally
sends the world a very different message.

[Our view of how states interact]{.underline} and compete [is expanded
when we combine IW with OS]{.underline}. Much as with any other interest
(e.g., physical or economic security), [the desire for OS can be
manipulated and undermined]{.underline}. Facets of [IW can]{.underline}
thus [be viewed as part of]{.underline} a spectrum of [tactics used to
target]{.underline} the [endogenous sources of OS]{.underline}. While
[representational force and counterpower]{.underline} both target
subjectivity, their [applicability is limited]{.underline}, either
[to]{.underline} when [a victim's subjectivity]{.underline} depends upon
its relationship with the speaker or to large egoistical states,
respectively. Moreover, their overt nature means the speaker is exposed
to backlash, potentially diluting the impact external actors have. Given
these limitations, [actors have impetus to pursue IW]{.underline}. By
covertly perverting the information landscape, [IW can
manipulat]{.underline}e domestic [efforts at relating
events]{.underline} or policies [to national narrative,
making]{.underline} certain [options appear more/less
shameful]{.underline}. Actors might also polarize debates between
subgroups in an effort to undermine the perceived stability of the
national narrative, erode a sense of home, and increase challenges to
the positive recognition of subgroups. As seen during the 2016 U.S.
election, Russia was able to exploit technological advances to
exacerbate and polarize debates and foster misperceptions between
ideological cleavages, eroding the foundations of OS and generating
anxiety. The [result was a divided American populace preoccupied with
regaining stability and the preservation of specific interpretations of
the meta-national narrative.]{.underline}

Conclusion and implications

[This article]{.underline} has raised questions about the role of the
prevalent discourses on information warfare in Russia and the West for
the relations between them. On the basis of poststructuralist
theoretical premises, it [analysed Russian and German media publications
since]{.underline} the onset of [the Ukrainian crisis]{.underline} in
2014. The comparative Discourse Analysis revealed an ambiguous
positioning of a Russian and a Western Self towards each other. With
representations building on long-established genealogies, Russian and
Western discourses engage interactively in political struggles.

But what are the implications of this discussion for Russia and the West
as (discursive) subjects engaging in Russia-West relations? Wæver (2002)
contends that ['\[overall\] policy in particular must hold a definite
relationship to discursive structures' since it defines what is deemed
sayable or doable]{.underline} (p. 27). This follows the Foucauldian
tradition, seeking to elucidate 'the rules for what can and cannot be
said and the rules for what is considered true and false' (Jorgensen &
Phillips, 2002, pp. 12--13). [It seems obvious that]{.underline}
currently, [both subjects are constrained by a]{.underline} rather
[hostile discourse that constructs the respective Other as offensive
opponent. That the domestic discourse constrains extreme dissident
positions became visible when]{.underline} Donald [Trump
was]{.underline} heavily [criticised]{.underline} by both Democrats and
Republicans for doubting Russian interference in the United States'
elections during a press conference with Putin in 2018.

[However, the preceding discussion has shown]{.underline}, firstly, that
these [hostile dispositions are]{.underline} relatively [malleable.
Rhetoric and policies in the longer run are]{.underline} thus
[not]{.underline} necessarily [doomed to remain
confrontational]{.underline}. Moreover, [the fact]{.underline} that the
[Western derogatory discourse is stuck]{.underline} primarily [with the
Russian government and]{.underline} President [Putin suggests
that]{.underline} any [political change in Russia could facilitate a
major change in discourse]{.underline}. Secondly, [the]{.underline}
sedimented [nature of liberal ideals in]{.underline} the [discursive
structure implies]{.underline} that [both Russia and the West still
speak]{.underline} to some extent [the same language.]{.underline} The
[current confrontational posture is]{.underline} thus [not]{.underline}
necessarily a [long-term]{.underline} development. However, given that
even the most sedimented discursive structures are not immune to change,
it is likely that the antagonistic discourse becomes more fundamental,
should the current cool down of relations persist. Finally, given that
both discourses reveal each other's contingency by representing
different, alternative interpretations of the world, neither appears
objective. For all participants within the West and Russia it thus
appears less natural what is 'right' or 'wrong', 'true' or 'false'.

While sharing similar sentimentalities regarding how states "trap" one
another, Steele (2007) views biographical narratives as the foundation
of subjectivity. He argues that [[when responding to]{.mark}
humanitarian [crises]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather than appeal to
international identities or norms, which large and proud states are
likely to be unmoved by, [[reflexive discourse becomes a potent
tool]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here [weaker [actors]{.mark} use rhetoric
that openly acknowledges their asymmetric power
relationship]{.underline} while also highlighting the incongruence
between the larger state's self-narrative and its failure to intervene,
thereby [provoking shame and [stimulat]{.mark}ing [behavioral
change]{.mark}]{.underline}. This can be seen in the [U.S. decision to
increase funding for Asian tsunami relief after being labeled "stingy"
by the U.N Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs]{.underline}.
Reflexive [discourse is]{.underline} one of three forms of
counterpower---[a challenge towards the aesthetics of a
state]{.underline}. In other words, if the state is "a work of art,"
counterpower are instances that stimulate the state to "engage its own
'art of living'" (Steele, 2012, p. 47). The second form is parrhesia,
instances wherein the parrhesiastes, a truth teller, openly criticizes
and reveals contradictions within a dominant actor, removing their
certainty over past and present behavior (p. 107). Cynic parrhesiastes
do this through particularly "provocative dialogue" as exemplified by
Osama bin Laden's 2004 speech using specific examples to portray
Washington as "incompetent, feckless, and even helpless" (p. 116). The
final form is self-interrogative imaging---distributing images that
force states to engage their sense of Self, as seen, for example, in the
United States when images of prisoners in Abu Graib were circulated
during the Iraq War. [While providing important insight regarding the
manipulation of endogenous sources of OS]{.underline}, [counterpower's
emphasis on power disparity and its focus on large egoistical
states]{.underline} (Steele, 2007, p. 906, 2012, Chap. 1) [constrains
its applicability]{.underline}. Moreover, given its overt nature, those
employing counterpower risk being vilified as the targeted population
seeks to maintain positive views of Self (Chernobrov,  2016),
potentially limiting the influence of external actors. Thus counterpower
is only momentary and ends once it is "captured by power...when it
becomes 'classified'" (Steele, 2012, p. 49), often allowing states to
discredit external challengers. While similarly focused on the
endogenous sources of OS, [[IW]{.mark} allows us to expand how, and to
what end, [actors target subjectivity]{.mark} and OS]{.underline}. [By
covertly distorting the [information]{.mark} environment of any state,
IW [facilitates domestic questioning of]{.mark} the congruence between
policy and national subjectivity and/or the very existence of [national
subjectivity]{.mark} itself]{.underline}. In this sense, IW provides
fodder to encourage/strengthen domestic "counterpower," making domestic
actors the target of potential backlash. Indeed, [part of [IW's]{.mark}
power comes from [encourag]{.mark}ing such [internal
hostility]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather than seeking behavioral
adjustment by threatening the "exposure of intolerable incongruities"
(Bially Mattern, 2004, p. 99) within a victim's subjectivity, [IW [might
thus enflame internal discrepancies]{.mark} towards this very
end]{.underline}. Here the aim is not merely to encourage "engagement"
with Self, but to [radicalize internal debates to erode the Self,
[generating]{.mark} a sense of [existential crisis]{.mark} and
anxiety--- ontological insecurity]{.underline}. To establish this
process, we must begin with the fact that [national narratives are not
independent objects removed from human agency]{.underline}. They are
formed and maintained through inherently political processes
(Bell, 2003, p. 75). Tellingly, Renan (1992) writes "historical error"
is essential for nations, while Smith (1999, p. 16) suggests internal
diversity most likely prevents a single version of the past. At the same
time, while nations are "contingent," they are also "situated, ordered
and bound" (Berenskoetter, 2014, p. 264), premised upon a "bedrock of
shared meanings and ideals" (Smith, 1999, p. 56) upon which a dominant
account usually takes hold (Ringmar, 2011, p. 7). While there is always
negotiation and contestation amongst derivative narratives, this often
occurs without jeopardizing the metanarrative (Berenskoetter, 2014, p.
279), allowing it to provide OS for a large majority of the population
(Skey, 2010) who become emotionally attached to it (Steele, 2007, p.
912). [IW allows external actors to impinge upon this
process]{.underline}. Following the USSR's collapse and unraveling of
communist ideology, Thomas (1998, pp. 9--10) notes how [[Russian society
lost its "cementing mechanism" and had to rely on controlling the
information psychological]{.mark} to recoup mental
stability]{.underline}. However, this position can easily be reversed;
[actors can employ IW to target OS by intruding upon domestic narrative
debates]{.underline}. Turning to Berzina's overview of Russian IW
scholarship, this connection is seen rather explicitly. For example,
given Russian scholars' view of humans and nations as "informative
self-learning systems," IW can insert new information into this system
to "destroy national consciousness" (Berzina, 2018, p. 165).
Technological advances and the emergence of the "networked society,"
which facilitated the rise of societal debate (Cronin & Crawford, 1999,
p. 260), provide actors with increasing opportunities to pursue such
aims. For one, [[debates are increasingly polarized]{.mark}, as
technological advances enable the avoidance of dissonant, and
acquisition of affirming, information]{.underline} (Lupovici, 2012, p.
818). Second, the [[Internet]{.mark} has become a primary "transitional
object]{.underline}" for achieving OS, [[embedding individuals within
online networks]{.underline}]{.mark} (Areni,  2019) that reinforce
social affiliations and deliver digital sources of news (Milina, 2012,
p. 55), providing the "warmth and information" critical for OS (Cohen &
Metzger, 1998, p. 52). A consequence, however, is individuals are
progressively interacting within "identity bubbles" (Kaakinen, Sirola,
Savolainen, & Oksanen, 2020), helping increase partisanship as a salient
social identity (Lupton, Singh, & Thorton, 2015; McCoy, Rahman, & Somer,
2018, p. 22). While ingroup bias does not presuppose intergroup conflict
(Allport, 1954/1979, p. 42), IW is positioned to exploit the role
digital and social media play in fostering/reinforcing partisan views to
accentuate perceived incompatibility. Studies have already found
consumers of partisan news "tend to express less accurate beliefs about
a host of politically charged topics" (Garrett, Long, & Jeong,  2019, p.
490). Given digital and social media lack the restraints found in
traditional media outlets (Cronin & Crawford, 1999, pp. 260, 492),
external actors are readily able to interject dis/misinformation or
masquerade as members of the targeted society to push these trends
further, manipulating the propensity to seek out validating information
and the ability to quickly circulate information throughout online
identity bubbles to influence intergroup perceptions. As perceived
estrangement and incompatibility grows, the subnational other
progressively appears "undomesticated" (Skey, 2010, p. 729), as
transgressing social convention and championing a radicalism that
transforms them from "normal political adversar\[ies\]" into an
"existential threat" (McCoy et al., 2018, p. 19). This can degrade into
"mass hysteria" (Umbrasas, 2018)---[periods when distorted [perceptions
of]{.mark} "social, cultural, or political [issues]{.mark}" take hold,
[sparking anxiety]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead of a "taken-for-granted"
national identity (Skey, 2010, p. 716), individuals thus face intense
competition for ownership over defining national subjectivity,
particularly as subgroups strives to maintain positive self-images
(Chernobrov, 2016). Accordingly, [such [rifts]{.mark} generate a
[break]{.mark}down in social interaction]{.underline} (Mitzen, 2006, p.
348) [and disrupt daily life, making it difficult to sustain [a sense of
constancy]{.mark} in one's "social and material
environment]{.underline}"---of being "at home" (Kinnvall, 2004, p. 747).
[Individuals are thus faced with a "fateful moment"---"phases at which
[things are wrenched out of joint]{.mark}]{.underline}" and
consequential decisions must be made (Giddens, 1991, pp. 113--114). As
individuals seek to grapple with this challenge, [they are
simultaneously confronted with reduced cognitive
certainty]{.underline}---the result of IW helping establish and then
broadcasting the existence of alternative "perceptions of reality"
(Umbrasas, 2018), making knowledge appear increasingly contingent.
Through these processes, IW comes to challenge OS on two fronts. First,
[by undermining a stable metanarrative and sense of home, IW
destabilizes individuals' biographical narratives]{.underline}. Second,
[by pol[arizing debates and augmenting]{.mark} perceived
[incompatibilities]{.mark} to the point former compatriots appear
"undomesticated]{.underline}," IW subverts existing frameworks for
managing anxiety around existential questions: [eroding certainty over
where threats reside (existence), [undermining the stability of
established belief systems]{.mark}]{.underline} (meaninglessness), [and
curbing positive subgroup recognition]{.underline} (condemnation). [This
re[sults in]{.mark}]{.underline} [[heightened anxiety and an existential
crisis]{.mark} as "the 'business as usual' attitude]{.underline}"
critical to OS is eroded (Giddens, 1991, p. 114). Overall, the
digitalization of society has raised the prospect for actors to target
the endogenous sources of OS. Increasingly, this means [all information
is now strategic]{.underline}; for example, acquiring/stealing troves of
digital data, personal and corporate, facilitates machine learning and
refines algorisms to allow for more efficient messaging in IW (Rosenbach
& Mansted, 2019, pp. 5--6). [[Russia has actively]{.mark} recognized and
[sought to capitalize on these]{.mark} changes]{.underline}
(Gerasimov, 2016, p. 24), investing into "enabling factors to adapt the
principles of subversion to the internet age" (Abrams, 2016, pp. 19--20;
Giles, 2016a, pp. 27, 36)---tactics increasingly employed by other
actors (Robinson et al., 2018). Fusing IW and OS helps to better
conceptualize such efforts. Specifically, the next section further
develops how actors target the endogenous sources of OS to influence
policy or foster ontological insecurity with reference to various
Russian IW operations.
