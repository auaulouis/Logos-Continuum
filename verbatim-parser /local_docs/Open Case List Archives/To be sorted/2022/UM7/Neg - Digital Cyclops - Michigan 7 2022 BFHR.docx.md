### 1NC\-\--Policy Debate is Aesthetic

#### The imagination and debate over competing words is artistic, playful, and scholarly simultaneously. 

**Chia, 96.** (Robert Chia, University of Stirling. "The Problem of
Reflexivity in Organizational Research: Towards a Postmodern Science of
Organization" Organization, Volume 3, No. 1, February. SAGE Journals.
Online.)

One more recent development in organizational theorizing results from
taking the problem of reflexivity seriously. Such organizational writers
accept that both their own accounts and those generated by others are
first and foremost linguistic constructions which operate according to
established conventional linguistic codes. Theories of organization are
deemed to be self-­justifying \'intelligible narratives\' which enable a
community of inquirers to arrive at some consensus regarding their
social experiences. As Gergen (1992) puts it: If there is one theme that
unites most of those confronting the postmodern irony, it is a **certain
sense of ludic humility. The view of knowledge‑making as a
transcendental pursuit removed from the trivial enthralments of daily
life, pristinely rational and transparently virtuous**, becomes so much
puffery. We should view these bodies of language we call knowledge in a
lighter vein‑as ways of putting things together, some pretty and others
petty. (Gergen, 1992: 215) **[Hence, [\'irony\',]{.mark}
\'self‑reflection\' [and \'playful seriousness\' replace the]{.mark}
rational [quest for \'certain\' or]{.mark} even [\'partially
true\']{.mark} [knowledge of an external organizational reality. For
these \'meta­reflexive\' theorists, both the bodyof‑knowledge claims in
organization theory and their own claims are to be understood in a
lighter vein as artistically crafted pieces of work]{.mark} in their own
right. [Theories generated mirror the concerns and preoccupations of the
theorists themselves and do not]{.mark}, as such, [claim any absolute,
groun­ded connexion with a reality beyond]{.mark}. Such writers would
argue that these crafted pieces of \'linguistic web\' contribute to the
making of our organizational reality.]{.underline}**

### 1NC\-\--Kroker Wrong

#### Kroker's thesis is wrong and they devolve into the same humanistic principles he criticizes

James **Steinhoff 16**, The University of Western Ontario, "Exits to the
Posthuman Future," Canadian Journal of Communication, Vol. 41, No. 3,
2016, p. 533-536

In Exits to the Posthuman Future (2014), Arthur [[Kroker
deploys]{.underline}]{.mark} a mutant strain of Marshall McLuhan's
(McLuhan and McLuhan 1988) medium theory to paint [[a dark picture
of]{.mark} high-technology [capitalist societies]{.mark}]{.underline}.
At its most dire points [this]{.underline} book [appears to be an
affirmation of]{.underline} Friedrich Nietzsche (1964) and Jean
[Baudrillard's]{.underline} (1994) [theses that God is dead and meaning
is impossible. Advanced [tech]{.mark}nology [is the primary cause of
this condition]{.mark}, [which is the posthuman era]{.mark}. Kroker
contends that previous conceptions of the posthuman were misguidedly
optimistic and that the posthuman must be grasped as a state of total
indeterminacy in which a literally **living technology dominates human
agency**. Yet, [there is a **tension**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Throughout
the text there are moments of tangible hope for a traditionally
humanistic future and, perplexingly, [[the book closes with an explicit
call to recover]{.mark} the social and ethical [values lost in]{.mark}
the ravages of [capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the end, it is hard
to say what this book is intended to do. [Kroker's dark posthumanist
prognosis [stands starkly juxtaposed with his latent
humanism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Arthur Kroker is a postmodernist Canadian
theorist who has been studying the intersections of technology and
culture since the mid-1980s. This new book consists of several essays
comprised of original material and new versions of previously presented
material. It is wide-ranging in topic, roving from drone warfare to
Obama's political rhetoric to media theory. In a high-speed and prolix
style that recalls William Gibson's cyberpunk fiction and the work of
McLuhan and Paul Virilio, [[Kroker sets out a way of thinking]{.mark}
about contemporary high-technological society\' [that follows
the]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}McLuhanian [[insistence on the
constant and unavoidable influence of media on humans]{.mark}---but
inverts it]{.underline}. The theoretical linchpin of this text is the
"dark tetrad" (p. 25), Kroker's inversion of McLuhan's four laws of
media. McLuhan asserted that all media have four effects on individuals
and societies: to enhance something, to obsolesce something, to retrieve
something that was previously obsolesced, and to intensify something to
the point of its reversal (McLuhan & McLuhan, 4988). Kroker presents
another side to the tetrad, which he describes, following Jacques
Derrida (2006), as "hauntological" (p. 193). The dark tetrad describes
disappearance instead of enhancement, substitution instead of
obsolescence, abandonment instead of retrieval, and stasis instead of
reversal (Kroker, 2014). These four functions describe the actions of
media from a non-anthropomorphic standpoint. This dehumanization of
McLuhan is necessary, Kroker asserts, because a fundamental feature of
the posthuman era is that technology has "in the most literal sense \...
now come alive" (p. 28). Yet Kroker's main interest here is not the
autonomous artificial intelligences of transhumanist speculation, nor is
it the academic posthumanisms of Katherine Hayles (2008) or Donna
Harraway (2000). [[Kroker's posthuman age is]{.mark} "[that]{.mark}
historical [moment when the power of tech]{.mark}nology [turns back on
itself]{.mark}, effectively [undermining traditional concepts such as
**subjectivity**]{.mark}, **[privacy]{.mark}**, **[and bounded
consciousness]{.mark}** in order to render all things truly uncertain
and unknowable"]{.underline} (p. 7). It is a "dystopian phase of
information technology" in which "the informatics of domination has
appropriated the resistance spirit of the borderlands" (p. 96). [Kroker
argues that the permeable human/machine boundaries]{.underline} of
Hayles and Hanaway [have been superseded by]{.underline}7
all-encompassing [machinic control]{.underline}. Kroker's posthuman is
thus a dark time for beings that still think of themselves as human. It
is also a dark time because it is quite literally haunted. Kroker holds
that: "the essence of the posthuman axiomatic inheres in the fact that
technology now eagerly seeks out that which was previously marginalized
as simultaneously ways of mobilizing itself as it effectively recodes
every aspect of social and nonsocial existence" (p. 6). This is the
hauntological aspect of media: that which was previously marginalized is
resurrected by technologies to serve as their contents and reasons for
being with no logic discernable to humans. [The result is the
bewildering posthuman era, which Kroker adumbrates using the concepts of
acceleration, drift, and crash]{.underline}. Acceleration will be
familiar to readers of other postmodernist technology theorists, such as
Virilio, and needs little elaboration. Crash depicts the collision
between accelerated technologies and traditional human qualities. Drift
is Kroker's most compelling contribution to thinking the posthuman.
[[Drift describes the perturbations of a society no longer directed by
human intention]{.mark}, but by myriad, incremental, and unpredictable
mutations in the codes that underlie molar reality]{.underline}. Code
drift "is the spectral destiny of the story of technology," (p. 50) but
it is also "nothing new," (p. 52) in that human evolution is a history
of sampling errors. The posthuman era is described as one of "drift
culture" in that the randomness and non-teleological nature of the
molecular realm takes over the molar. The dark tetrad is thus to be
understood as a schematic of how code drift rearranges the world without
intention or consciousness. Code drift converts humans to "data flesh"
that fully absorbs the primary modernist disavowal---the sense of the
absurd in all the great referentials---as its key conditions of
possibility" (p. 53). Drift culture is the technological proof of
existentialism. [[Kroker is]{.underline}]{.mark} quite [[brief on
suggesting how we ought to proceed with social life]{.underline}]{.mark}
in the drifting absurdity of the posthuman era. He devotes only a
four-page epilogue to the question of what is to be done now. [Not
surprisingly, given the existentialist tone of the work, he advocates an
aesthetic comportment toward the posthuman]{.underline}. Specifically,
he endorses an aesthetics based on Jean-Frangois Lyotard's (2011) notion
of the "figural" or adiscursive gestalt---presumably adapting it to
grasp the adiscursivity of ubiquitous code: "Art of this (posthuman)
order recodes the question of aesthetics by the creation of a mode of
perception that fully opens to the discontinuous, tire fragmentary, the
uncertain, the reversal" (Kroker 2014, P-197)- [[This call for extreme
openness evokes]{.mark} Nietzsche's [Dionysian]{.mark} mode of
[being]{.mark}, [in which destruction and creation possess equal
valence]{.mark}]{.underline}, but Kroker quickly qualifies this,
asserting that since: the posthuman condition has revealed decadence
\... as the basic ontology of late capitalism, the point of a figural
art that would "harden, worsen, accelerate decadence" would be precisely
the reverse, that is to say, it would draw into a greater visibility
those intangible, but very real, impulses to social solidarity and
ethical probity that haunt the order of the real. (p. 198) [[This foray
into the]{.mark} supposedly [posthuman ends with a call for]{.mark} the
[reinstatement of the most humanistic]{.mark} of [principles]{.mark}.
The idea seems to be that the novel form of living in the posthuman era
is analogous to the collective yearnings of the "spirit of
'68."]{.underline}

technology: reconfiguring Martin Heidegger's thinking," 2-8-2011

Moreover, Heidegger maintains: ''Readiness-to-hand is the way in which
entities as they are 'in themselves' are defined
ontologico-categorially.''47 According to Heidegger's fundamental
phenomenology, which he unfolds in detail in Being and Time and
reaffirms a decisive part of in ''The Question Concerning Technology,''
[nature is]{.underline} ''primally'' [revealed in its
''usability'']{.underline} and ''serviceability-for-;'' [that is to
say]{.underline}, ['['nature'' is a resource **long before the**]{.mark}
**actual [rise of]{.mark} modern and ancient [tech]{.mark}nology**,
namely **[simultaneously with the]{.mark} very [origin of human]{.mark}
being[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That something is primordially revealed
in its ''usability'' and ''serviceability-for-'' does not imply that it
is actually used or serves accordingly, but that it is revealed as
standing ready to be utilized in the corresponding context. As such, it
is revealed as ''standing-reserve.'' This, for example, also
[corresponds to the **[empirical fact]{.mark}** that **[prehistoric
humans]{.mark}**]{.underline} settled close to woods and rivers. In
these areas they [[**always** had **stockpiles of timber**]{.mark},
power for [**transportation**, and]{.mark} easy **[access to drinking
water]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Based on ''The Question Concerning
Technology'' and completed through references to Being and Time, we now
have an interpretation of the origin of the essence of modern
technology, which traces back the characteristic revealing of das
Gestell to the beginning of humankind.48 This does not imply that
prehistoric technology is identical with contemporary technology; rather
the third [[genealogy]{.underline}]{.mark} of the rule of das Gestell
[[suggests]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[when ''we]{.mark} still more
primally'' [try to consider the origin of the challenging revealing
characterizing the rule of das Gestell]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
**[we]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in fact [rediscover that it is connected
to being human]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The rule of das Gestell **[has
challenged humans as long as they have existed]{.mark}**. In this sense,
**[humans first and foremost exist under the rule of das
Gestell]{.mark}**]{.underline}.49 [This]{.underline} also [entails a
revision]{.underline} and precision [of Heidegger's renowned formula
characterizing the world-connectedness of human existence:
being-in-the-world]{.underline}. Based on the comparison of ''The
Question Concerning Technology'' and Being and Time, [human existence is
better described as being-under-the-spell-of-das-Gestell.]{.underline}
Trying to understand the various more-or-less explicit accounts of the
origin of the rule of das Gestell in ''The Question Concerning
Technology'' and the resulting ambiguity is not just an exercise, nor
only a way to criticize Heidegger. Rather, it is a way to better
understand the nuances and layers in Heidegger's thinking concerning
technology and to warn against a short-sighted ''saving'' from an
alleged danger. If the challenging revealing of nature, which
characterizes the rule of das Gestell is taken seriously, then we cannot
avoid it just by revolutionizing our technology, instead, we must revise
our very human existence.

#### Kroker is wrong -- doesn't understand biotechnology, doesn't understand his own philosophy, and ignores that the will to technology is inevitable

Kroker is correct that the science most prevalent in the 20th century is
that of biology rather than physics, and the most controversial
technology therefore bio-technology. [Kroker, like much of the public
**not actually versed** in the technology part of bio-technology, jumps
to the assumption that the small successes (such as bio-engineering
bacteria to produce insulin) indicate that large scale human
bio-engineering is 'just around the corner'. The reality is **far
different**]{.underline} --- having just completed a short stint at a
firm involved with Google in producing a genome variant search engine
that meets all the security and identity management requirements that
each genetic database owner puts on their data, [we're **not even at the
point** where a reasonably simple search for a given genome variant can
be accomplished.]{.underline}

Biology itself is in much the same state as physics in 1900 when Planck
first called for a quantum theory --- there's a strong sense that our
past biology is overly simplistic, but not a clear path forward.

The human genome project has taught us plenty of things, but the most
important of those is that most genes or [gene combinations are
interpreted dynamically in some way based on the environment, and since
we know **neither the meaning of most of the genetic code, nor how the
interpreter works**, and we have no Rosetta Stone to give us a clue to
either, bio-engineering at the human level is going to remain relatively
simplistic for some time. We're not in the bionic age quite yet, though
Kroker appears to believe we are]{.underline}. There are genes that map
directly to phenotypes, such as eye colour, but that appears to be
largely true only in phenotypes that are relatively unimportant, again
such as eye colour, which makes little difference to anyone other than
cosmeticians.

[I won't go into the number of more important predictions made by
Heidegger in particular that **Kroker is apparently completely oblivious
to**,]{.underline} despite many of them having already come to pass in
the short time since his death in 1976, or in danger of coming to pass
imminently. [However omissions such as the identity of the 'last god';
the 'thin wall' that separates our pure imagination (as in dreams) with
our experience of reality; and the notion of Being as change are
somewhat]{.underline} [unforgivable]{.underline}. Of course, that takes
us back to the omission of Hegel and the light Hegel's work shines on
the three thinkers Kroker does deal with.

[Kroker seems to miss that for Heidegger technology is a 'destining',
i.e. a dispensation of Being itself (and in some senses the most overt
manifestation of Being in postmodern times), and therefore **not
something to be either for or against**, but something one needs to
discover a "free relation" to. This destining subverts the title of the
work itself, in that technology as a dispensation of Being has nothing
to do with will in Nietzsche's sense, where will to power reverts almost
immediately to will to will, since power is only the ability to will
more.]{.underline}

[He also skims over the important notion of the ontological transparency
of technology, i.e. given an iPhone, nearly **anyone can see almost
immediately how it could be better**, how it doesn't (yet) quite
substitute for the essence of technology, though we do use specific
technological artifacts of that kind in substitution for technology as a
whole in our daily speech without thinking much if anything about it.
The same cannot be said when we look at a tree or a horse, for
instance.]{.underline}

The book is written in a fast-paced style apparently intended to get
average readers interested in the work of these thinkers and how it both
affects and is affected by events in the world since their work was

### 1NC\-\--Improvement Good

#### Productivity is good for [global quality of life]{.underline} and [reducing structural violence]{.underline}---they're [reductionist]{.underline}.

Just kidding, that's not what happened at all. In fact, [[as the
world]{.mark} has [become more capitalist]{.mark} and]{.underline} more
[globalized]{.underline}, the **[[quality of life]{.underline}]{.mark}**
for the average person, and **[especially for the average poor
person]{.underline}**, **[[has increased]{.mark}
substantially]{.underline}**. [[In 1990, 37% of the]{.mark} global
[population lived]{.mark} on less than [\$1.90 per
day]{.mark}]{.underline}. [By 2012, that number had been reduced to
12.8%, and [in 2015 it was under 10%]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The source
of this progress is]{.underline}n't a massive wealth redistribution
program; it's massive wealth creation --- that is, **[economic
growth]{.underline}**. [Economists]{.underline} David Dollar and Aart
Kraay [found]{.underline} that, **[[in a]{.mark} global [sample
of]{.mark} over [100 countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [changes
in]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [income]{.mark} growth of the bottom 40% of
the world's income earners [are]{.mark} **highly [correlated
with]{.mark} economic [growth]{.mark} rates**]{.underline}. On the other
hand, changes in inequality contributed relatively little to changes in
social welfare of the poor over the last few decades. [There is good
reason to believe]{.underline} that **[the expansion of [free
trade]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [facilitated by international
organizations]{.underline} like the World Trade Organization (WTO) and
its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),
[have [had a]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[considerable impact in
accelerating]{.mark} the economic [development]{.mark} of developing
countries]{.underline}**. In the 1990s GATT facilitated reforms which
moved 125 countries towards freer trade by reducing the burden of
government imposed trade barriers like tariffs. This was the first
serious attempt at trade reform for most developing countries at the
time, and arguably presents a unique natural experiment on the economic
effects of trade reform. In fact, [a paper]{.underline} published by the
National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), [specifically examined how
trade reforms]{.underline} facilitated by GATT [affected the economic
development of the reforming countries]{.underline}. In the paper, [the
authors compared the trends in economic growth before and after trade
reform in the reforming countries]{.underline}. [Then they compared
those results to trends in economic growth of a control group of
countries which didn't undergo trade reform. What they found was very
encouraging for proponents of free trade]{.underline}. [Prior to reform,
the economic development of reformers and non-reformers was practically
identical]{.underline}, **[but after reform]{.underline}**, **[the
economic development of reforming countries accelerated while
[non-reforming countries saw]{.mark} their economies stagnate and
[decline]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The results suggest that the
**[[reforms]{.mark} towards freer trade lead to an [increase]{.mark} in
[income]{.mark} per capita]{.underline}** of around 20% in the long-run,
[an effect [so large]{.mark} that [it]{.mark} almost [**certainly** had
a **positive**]{.mark} **and non-trivial [impact on poverty
reduction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Similarly, other [research has
shown]{.underline} that [more free market trade policies result in
**lower rates of extreme poverty**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[child mortality]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in developing
countries]{.underline}. There are other benefits as well. One study on
trade reform in Indonesia found that [reductions of import tariffs led
to an **increase in disposable income among poor
households**]{.underline}, which allowed them to pull their children out
of the labor force, **[leading to "a strong decline" in the incidence of
child labor.]{.underline}** Unfortunately, many [activists have
reflexively taken up the cause of opposing the expansion of global
capitalism]{.underline}, for a number of reasons. Western anti-sweatshop
activists, for example, will often argue in favor of government imposed
barriers to trade with poor countries because their working conditions
are terrible in comparison to those in developed Western nations. In
their view, western consumers should not be promoting a cycle of
capitalist exploitation by buying products made in Vietnamese
sweat-shops. [But [satisfactory working conditions]{.mark} aren't the
natural state]{.underline} of mankind; **[they [are a consequence
of]{.mark} decades of economic [development]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Erecting barriers to trade with poor countries is surely a large
impediment to their development, in fact, research suggests that
existing developed world tariffs depress economic growth rates in the
developing world by 0.6 to 1.6 percent per person, a considerably large
effect. Moreover, [the sweat-shops which produce clothing for Westerners
are often **much better than alternative forms of domestic
employment**]{.underline}. In poor countries like Bangladesh, China, and
Vietnam, the apparel industry consistently pays more than most other
domestic industries. According to research by economist Ben Powell, [in
poor countries "most sweatshop jobs provide an **above average standard
of living** for their workers."]{.underline} Notably, a [paper published
in the Journal of Development Economics found]{.underline} that [the
expansion of the garments industry in Bangladesh lead to an increase in
employment and income among **young women**]{.underline}, **[giving them
the means to finance their own education]{.underline}**. Remarkably the
authors found that, "**[the demand for education generated through
manufacturing growth appears to have a much larger effect on female
educational attainment compared to a large-scale government conditional
cash transfer program to encourage female schooling]{.underline}**."
Foreign investment is also more desirable than opponents of capitalism
and globalization give it credit for. The conventional wisdom among
activists in wealthy countries is that multinational corporations
exploit poor workers in third world countries for cheap labor, profiting
off people working in sweatshop conditions. It should come as a surprise
to the individuals who hold this view to learn that 85% of people in
developing countries believe that foreign companies building factories
in their countries is a good thing, according to Pew Research. In fact,
[for all the talk of exploitative multinational
corporations]{.underline}, [[research shows]{.underline}]{.mark} that,
in general, **[these [corporations provide higher wages]{.mark} and
better working conditions [than domestic employers]{.mark} in developing
countries]{.underline}**. Additionally, [when multinational corporations
build factories in poor countries, it raises the demand for low-skilled
workers, resulting in higher wages for local workers]{.underline}.
Consistent with this fact, **[recent empirical evidence demonstrates
that investment by foreign companies in developing countries reduces
both poverty and income inequality by raising the incomes of low-skilled
workers]{.underline}**. Foreign investment can also make people in
relatively low-income countries better off by providing better or more
inexpensive products. A recent analysis published by the [NBER found
that foreign retailers like Wal-Mart greatly reduce the cost of living
for both the rich and poor in Mexico]{.underline}, **[making everyone
along the income distribution better off]{.underline}**. Global
capitalism is by no means a perfect phenomenon. Many businesses do have
questionable labor practices that are worthy of contempt. And free
market policies may in many instances lead to socially undesirable
outcomes, sometimes on a large scale. However, **[the one-dimensional,
automatic [denunciation of capitalism]{.mark} and the accompanying
refusal to give it any credit for its successes]{.underline}** --- as
social media activists have done --- **[[reflects an]{.mark}
uncompromising, and]{.underline}** quite frankly **[[ignorant
worldview]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[It is one in which capitalism is
always bad, no matter what the evidence tells us.]{.underline}**

### 1NC\-\--Tech Debates Good

Heidegger (1962) and Feenberg, in his critical theory (2003), suggest
that a synthesis between these [opposing polarities of rules versus
interpretation is **possible**. Both argue that, in association with the
instrumental role a technology may have, we must also give consideration
to the **essence of the technology** in terms of its social and cultural
implications]{.underline}. Out of this emerges a synthesis that leads to
an anamorphosis in technology education. In other words, the
technologies that we simply accept as presented are often distortions of
the truth, much as the lettering used in road markings appears to be
elongated and distorted from the point of view of a pedestrian. However,
the same markings when viewed from a driver's point of view, seen head
on and from a different perspective, appear, as a result of
foreshortening, to be perfectly in proportion. This is deliberate on the
part of the designers, but significantly, very few of us, drivers or
pedestrians, are actually aware of this. [It is only by repositioning
ourselves that we may begin to see a different perspective, and this
may, in turn, serve to transform our previously distorted values by
illuminating and clarifying the **controlling logic of the
technologically mediated world** we inhabit (Dakers,
2005a).]{.underline} A technological literacy in which the dialectics of
"calculation versus meditation, objectification versus art, 'world'
versus 'earth', identity versus difference" (Kroker, 2004: 38) are
explored is therefore a crucial part of a learner's technological
development.

Technology education in this synthesis should have a "relationship" with
industry, but not a subservient one, not one that is simply in the
service of industry. Critical [**debate about technology** and the role
that industry has in its development **must be encouraged**. These
debates must engage with global issues relating the sustainable
development of technology, methods and patterns of consumption, and
their relationship to ecological sustainability. Technology is not
neutral, and its proliferation in terms of mass production, if not
challenged, threatens the democratic process.]{.underline}

[Technology education in the twenty-first century can therefore **no
longer be programmed instruction**]{.underline} with behavioral
objectives that set out a "divide and conquer" approach to learning.
[The vocational and academic polarities in terms of technology education
must "dissolve into reciprocity, each constituting the other" (Grumet,
1992: 31). **Discourse regarding the very essence of technology**, the
way technology affects our cultural development and our participation in
a global society, **must become embedded into technology education**. We
must learn to interpret the world of technology for ourselves, and we
can only do that through the engagement of discourse about
technology]{.underline}. In order to do this, we urgently need to
develop a new philosophy for technology education that has at its center
[the development of a **technological literacy**.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Tech Debates Good

#### Attempts to manage technological problems are inevitable and good -- they tend to a fragile working order WITHOUT falling into a strictly managerial approach. That uniquely lets us recognize complexity and accept insecurity

**Nordmann**, Professor of Philosophy and History of Science and
Technoscience at Darmstadt Technical University, **'18**

(Alfred, "Four Horsemen and a Rotten Apple. On the Technological
Rationality of Nuclear Security," in *Jahrbuch Technikphilosophie:
Arbeit und Spiel*, pg. 279 -- 294)

The apple is rotting. [[During]{.underline}]{.mark} the times of [[the
Cold War]{.underline}, [the]{.underline}]{.mark} [precarious
[equilibrium]{.mark}]{.underline} [of strategic threats had its own
working order]{.underline}. **[It [could be
trusted]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}, in fact, **[had to be
trusted]{.underline}** in many ways. [The [weapons were]{.mark}
carefully **[monitored]{.mark}**]{.underline}, subject to permanent
surveillance from many points of view. [They were closely
watched]{.underline} through the eyes of one\'s own strategists,
technicians and engineers, military personnel, local opposition forces,
but also through the eyes of friends and foes, international agencies
and monitoring groups. [Everyone was attending to the
weapons]{.underline} [for different]{.underline}, [perhaps conflicting
reasons]{.underline}, and yet the many observations were maintained in a
relation of mutual support. The weapons themselves became fixated and
paralyzed at their center of attention.

[When the so-called **»four horsemen«**]{.underline} (Henry Kissinger,
George Shultz, William Perry, Sam Nunn) and political leaders like
Barack Obama have [called for a world without nuclear arms]{.underline},
[it is because they are worried about the **break-down of**]{.underline}
this **[working order]{.underline}**.24 [In their view, the
[current]{.mark} modes of [monitoring]{.mark},]{.underline}
proliferation, negotiation, [and sanctioning [represent a deviation
from]{.mark}]{.underline} the Cold War rationality [of deterrence with
its system of **[mutual checks and balances]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Accordingly, [[they call for]{.mark} **adequate ways of [controlling
material flows]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [of regulating
access]{.underline}, of instituting transparency and accountability.
**[[Their question is]{.mark} a [technical]{.mark}
question]{.underline}**: [[Given]{.mark} the half-life of
plutonium]{.underline} [and given the [volatility of]{.mark} systems of
[government]{.mark}]{.underline} in many parts of the world, [[how does
one institute]{.mark} a robust international system of
[arms-control]{.mark}?]{.underline} Thus, [they worry only
secondarily]{.underline} [whether]{.underline} the [weapons might get
into the wrong hands]{.underline}, politically speaking and in the short
term. [They pose **primarily** a question]{.underline} [from within a
technologically advanced]{.underline}, economically and politically
[robust knowledge society]{.underline} --- aside from the United States,
[who can be counted upon to reliably provide the necessary know-how in
the long term?]{.underline} Who can take responsibility for the
management of what was once and is no longer a denumerable, firmly
circumscribed set of nuclear things?

This point can be further developed by briefly considering three other
aspects of the current state of debate: First, as Christopher Daase has
pointed out, the extension into the future of the nuclear privilege of
weapon states in the NPT becomes questionable when this privilege no
longer serves to maintain a taboo in times of strategic conflict but
when it somewhat arrogantly declares whose hands are the good hands such
that they can be entrusted to carry out a managerial process. Inclusion
and exclusion can be justified more easily on the criterion of the
possession of nuclear weapons, it becomes contestable if the criterion
is the cultural competence of handling with due diligence and care a
dangerous and globally endangering commodity.25 Second, this may prove
to be the reason why some of the non-nuclear states like Norway,
Austria, Mexico are seizing the moment to claim that, if anyone, they
are best suited to frame the question or redefine the terms of the
debate. They wish to bring the humanitarian consequences to the fore and
thus the mishandling of the bomb, irrespective of a balance of power or
terror.26 Finally, [[when the question is]{.mark} one of
[maintaining]{.mark} or recreating [a safe working order **for a
dangerous tech**]{.mark}**nology**]{.underline} [and when the arms race
is taking place between knowledge societies and their claims that the
technology is with them in good hands]{.underline}, [[the general
tech]{.mark}nical [capabilities]{.mark} of these societies [become
**increasingly important**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The responsibility of
diplomats and negotiators in the political and military sphere to create
conditions for global security is shifting to the maintenance, broadly
speaking, of a safety culture in civil society.

If this diagnosis is correct, the rules of the game have changed as has
the rationale for inclusion and exclusion in the club of nuclear-weapon
states, and the definition of the community of responsible actors.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} global [[challenge]{.underline}
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} defined [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} as
**[[preserving peace]{.underline}]{.mark}** or security in an age of
ideological conflict and competing national interests.
[I[nstead]{.underline}]{.mark}[, the challenge is one of **[tending to a
working order]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} nuclear
[safety]{.mark}]{.underline} and safeguards[. [Issues of
prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline} and disarmament,
[transparency]{.underline} [[and **control**]{.underline}]{.mark} now
[[appear]{.mark} in the collective consciousness]{.underline} [as
[analogous to]{.mark} the global threat of [climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Both put]{.underline}]{.mark} [national
and stakeholder [interests **into a managerial
mode**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The Earth and the Bomb need to be
**handled with care**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[grounded in the]{.mark}
perhaps illusory [hope that]{.mark} in good hands]{.underline},
[with]{.mark} a technical mindset, [and [attunement **to**]{.mark} **the
[complexity]{.mark} of affairs**]{.underline}, [[the challenge can be
**met**]{.mark} and the danger **contained**.]{.underline}

Hazardous Waste

At this point [it may appear as if I wanted to recommend or **valorize
an engineering approach**]{.underline} [that **abstains from moral and
political judgement**]{.underline} but brings to the table the requisite
understanding for maintaining, modulating, recreating a working order or
technological system. **[This is not the case.]{.underline}** [I am
arguing merely that [one need to **take seriously**]{.mark} the
**different [modes of conceiving]{.mark} the [problems]{.mark}** that
are **in need of solution**]{.underline} --- [not only because the
definition of [a problem **entails a**]{.mark} **conception of its
[solution]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the **[reasoning processes]{.mark}
adequate to it**]{.underline}. **[If only for heuristic
purposes]{.underline}** [[we should attend to]{.mark} the implications
of [a shift]{.mark} from the logic of warfare and deterrence [to a
**logic of attunement and trust**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [attunement
to a working order and trust in the good hands of technical
expertise]{.underline}. In conclusion, here are some of these
implications, briefly stated.

First of all, [the [acquisition of]{.mark} working
[knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and the ability to]{.mark}
**maintain**]{.underline} [and [**modulate** a working
order]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[does nothing to justify technocratic
approaches o]{.mark}r to [en-throne]{.mark} the expertise of [managers
and engineers.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As the case of the klu(d)ge served
to remind us, [deviations from strategic rationality]{.underline}
[coincide with deviations from top-down engineering or rational
design]{.underline}. [The situations in which working
knowledge]{.underline} [comes to the fore are **highly
ambivalent**,]{.underline} [whether]{.underline} [it is the challenge of
maintaining a rotten apple]{.underline} [or]{.underline} of
[managing]{.underline} material flows in [an ageing nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}. [In these situations]{.underline}, [[rational
decision making is]{.mark} of the kind [where a]{.mark}]{.underline}
security [**[update]{.underline}** [is scheduled to the
o]{.underline}]{.mark}[perating [s]{.mark}ystem]{.underline} of a
computer [[and users wonder]{.mark} a bit nervously whether it is
**really such a good idea** to install the update.]{.underline} Not only
the [[r]{.mark}eaders]{.underline} of Charles Per-row\'s Normal
Accidents [will wonder [whether the]{.mark} security [update]{.mark}s
[might **increase**]{.mark} the **complexity**]{.underline}, perhaps
**[[instability]{.underline}]{.mark}**, perhaps
**[insecurity]{.underline}** [of the operating system]{.underline}.27
And of course, with the end of the Cold War, the operating system of
nuclear security has been changed, prompting us to ask anew what are the
conditions for stability and security.

### 1NC\-\--Aesthetics Fails

#### Aesthetics doesn't solve anything but attempting to endorse it both reentrenches capitalism and enables racialized capitalist oppression

**Bromberg 13** (Svenja Bromberg PhD - social theorist and philosopher
with expertise in French and German thought from the 19th to the 21st
century, "THE ANTI-POLITICAL AESTHETICS OF OBJECTS AND WORLDS BEYOND",
MetaMute, 25 July 2013,
<https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond>,
MG)

There is at first a very material sense in which its advocates justify
the turn to objects. [We are at a point where our faith in the powers of
the subject to critique and subvert reality, as grounded in
Enlightenment theory, **has been truly defeated**, not least by
capitalism's now much discussed ability to demand precisely subjective
-- emotional or affective -- investments in its exploitative
machinery.]{.underline}[[^5^](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote5sym) Thus,
it is not only the fact that '**subjects are always already
subjected'**,]{.underline} which we have learned from Foucault, Butler
and other
poststructuralists.[[6]{.underline}](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote6sym) [But
if capitalism wants us to be ever more alive, happy and truly engaged in
shaping our own lives on the basis of the endless possibilities this
world has to offer, then the critique offered by vitalist theories,
aesthetic modes such as Bourriaud's '**relational aesthetics'** and more
critical forms of emancipated spectatorship against an objectifying and
alienating capitalist reality **appear assimilated and
defused**.]{.underline}[^[7]{.underline}^](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote7sym) As
Diedrich Diederichsen outlines in a recent e-flux article, it is
precisely what was still antithetical to the Fordist assembly line --
[different modes of dreaming 'dangerously' or living authentic or
alternative lives -- that seems to have become part of the post-Fordist
'imperative to produce a perfect self as a perfect
thing'.]{.underline}[[^8^](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote8sym) Smiles
or grins, day-dreams and ways of being that could formerly help
alleviate or escape the alienated existence of the labourer have
themselves become reified as part of the **requisite service we are
compelled to
provide**.]{.underline}[^[9]{.underline}^](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote9sym) Diederichsen
describes a sense, similar to the German theatre director René Pollesch
in his play *Love is Colder than Capital* in which **[all relations have
become toxic and emotions have been rendered cold objects for
capital.]{.underline}**[[^10^](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote10sym) Thus,
the primary concern seems to be with oppressive, exploitative and
reified capitalist social relations and how to break out of them -- but
the solutions we're confronted with from the diverse strands of the 'new
materialisms' no longer lie in the critique of these relations, but
rather in a nonrelational and un-dialectical gesture that posits the
world of matter against the man-made disaster of a neoliberal
existence.]{.underline}[^[11]{.underline}^](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote11sym)

[The search for what Diederichsen calls 'de-reification' ventures
towards that which evades representation, which is not rendered
object *qua* instrumental reason but *qua* its own force, the dark, the
mystic, the animate but soul-less -- something that is more truly cold
and yet not cold at all. This line of argument, however -- which is
echoed in Hito Steyerl's emphatic call for us to finally accept the
death of the subject and embrace the forces of construction and
destruction, of violence and the possibility stored within things --
problematically **sidelines the classed, racialised and gendered
oppressions of capitalist reality**]{.underline}**.** Within this,
masses of people have never been granted any 'subject status' in the
first place and are, instead, rendered mere objects or even superfluous,
because not productive, for capital. From the point of view of these
relations, [the move towards accepting or even embracing objectification
as in itself emancipatory can be **nothing more than a bad
joke.**]{.underline}

[This sentiment, which shares its focus with the new materialisms, tends
to uphold a mind-body dualism in which the subject is associated with
the mind and the bad effects of Enlightenment rationalism, whereas the
physical body with its pre-cognitive responses and movements is often,
and rather miraculously, able to maintain a certain independence from
worldly subjections. Even if there is an investment in overcoming this
dualism and a certain caution against glorifying 'nature' as the
unchanging outside of the human world to be called upon when attempts to
elevate culture fail, the new materialisms' emphasis on pre-cognitive
affects, feelings and touch in the realm of the natural, or as moments
of 'matter receiving form', **cannot escape the body's
prioritisation.**]{.underline}[**^[12]{.underline}^**](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote12sym) This
tendency towards an 'aesthetics through
embodiment'[^13^](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote13sym),
which finds its theoretical anchor in Brian Massumi's work and other
thinkers in the field of **Affect Studies,** is still very much
entangled with the **human** body and its ability to be drawn into new
relational and animate fields through or as part of an
artwork.[^14^](https://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/anti-political-aesthetics-objects-and-worlds-beyond#sdfootnote14sym)

### 2NC\-\--Aesthetics Fails

#### Aesthetics as a method is dead in the 21**^st^** century

**Zubatov 19** (Alexander Zubatov - practicing attorney specializing in
general commercial litigation, "Politics vs. Aesthetics: Why Great Art
Cannot Conform to Our Political Views", Aero Magazine, 26 July 2019,
<https://areomagazine.com/2019/07/26/politics-vs-aesthetics-why-great-art-cannot-conform-to-our-political-views/>,
MG)

[The Aesthetic Achieves Lift-Off and Comes Back Down with a
Thud]{.underline}

This exalted vision of the purity and autonomy of art, in which the
artist is a creative visionary, a Promethean hero, gave rise to the
Romantic sensibility of the late eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries---and to much that followed. It informs Swinburne's bold
pronouncement, "Art for Art's sake first of all, and afterwards the rest
shall be added to her ... but from the man who falls to artistic work
with a moral purpose shall be taken away even that which he has"; the
Russian formalists' elevation of the self-referential patterns of
aesthetic form as art's singular guiding light; and even Carl Jung's
vision of the artist as the expression of the highest truths of our
collective unconscious, "the unwitting mouthpiece of the psychic secrets
of his time."

This reverential tradition led to the canonization of aesthetic works as
academic literature departments took shape in the late nineteenth
century. These masterpieces, T. S. Eliot writes in his 1919 essay,
"Tradition and the Individual Talent," are monuments in an imaginary
library and "form an ideal order among themselves." By Eliot's time,
Shiner tells us, art and culture---and their accompanying norms of
manners and refinement---had become a great dividing line, replacing an
earlier divide between the large mass of common folk and a tiny
hereditary aristocracy:

[The emergence of new art institutions like art museums, literary
reviews and secular concerts led to the use of cultural choices to mark
social ascension, and a consequent withdrawal of art from lower-class
culture, so that whereas in 1500, popular culture was everyone's
culture, by 1800, the clergy, nobility, merchants and professional men
and their wives had **abandoned popular culture to the lower classes**
...]{.underline}

By the late nineteenth century, the kind of multilevel culture with
which we are now familiar began to emerge. [One could identify a
person's social class in part by what papers or books they read, what
music they listened to, what plays they saw, what sort of pictures they
preferred.]{.underline}

[But this is becoming less and less true today; art and culture have
**ceased to serve** as the dividing line between the elites and the
unschooled, unwashed masses. Art lost that status when, as I argue here,
the vaguely literate but entirely uncultivated post-war techno-financial
elite **replaced the old literary intelligentsia**, whereupon literature
and other hallmarks of high culture began to undergo a first gradual and
then more rapid rot on the vine. Marxist and Marx-inspired class
prejudice, together with Dadaism and postmodernism, leveled the
distinctions between high and low, avant-garde and kitsch, originality
and banality and ultimately between art and everything else, resulting
in profound and sweeping biases against perceived elites and difficult
elite culture. Ultimately, conventional aesthetic merit ceased to
matter.]{.underline}

[But banal or low art]{.underline} differs fundamentally from high art:
[it **lacks the visionary gleam**; it can only **reflect society back to
itself**. Such art could no longer be credibly thought to **fulfill
anything like the transformative**, redemptive function attributed to
art by Schiller and his followers. The special status of the great
artist, the creative genius, the echo of divinity, quickly fell away, to
be replaced by market values,]{.underline} which equate genius with
worldly success and relegate the true geniuses toiling in obscurity to
the realm of oddball quackery, making them figures of ridicule. And woe
be to those effete intellectuals and elitist critics that still dare
abide by the traditional distinction between high and low and speak ill
of comics, comic book films, sitcoms, reality TV, pop music, hip hop and
so on.

### 1NC\-\--Tech Good

#### Only by enveloping every conversation and reinstating the will to technology in all can AI be developed correctly

**Bell 20** (Genevieve Bell -- Distinguished Professor and Violet
McKenzie Chair at the Australian National University, "Why we need a
cybernetic future", Australian National University, 14 November 2020,
<https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/2020/11/14/why-we-need-cybernetic-future/>,
MG)

Our possible futures

So why is this story important to engineering and its possible futures?
Well, because [right now we are living in a time when the power of
computing seems limitless. We are still gobsmacked by the volume of data
generated every day. Our conversations are **still about what to do with
all that** computing power and all that data]{.underline}. Right now,
governments, universities and companies are all competing to take
advantage of recent and forthcoming innovations. And [everyone is
worrying for the future, and also wondering about it.]{.underline}

[I believe engineers and engineering offer us a way to navigate that
future. But to do that successfully, we will need to change and adapt.
An historical analysis of cybernetics and the Macy Conferences reveal
that the early conversations were characterised by a systems approach to
how society **should integrate and develop artificial intelligence**,
focusing on how humanity might be enhanced]{.underline}. Economic
benefit was a secondary consideration, in stark contrast to how AI
applications are positioned and employed in the majority cases today.
This lesson tells us about innovation and impact on society, and about
[the need to keep everyone in the loop. Not just the technical loop, but
the societal one, too.]{.underline}

The good news is that engineering has always been about precisely this.
The whole history of engineering is about a body of knowledge that grew
up around the need to keep humans safe as technical systems achieved
increasing degrees of scale and scope. So really, engineers have never
been more relevant or more necessary. Some 200 years ago, the rise of
trains and railways required engineers to help ensure steam engines
could get to scale safely; we need engineers and their allies to help
bring artificial intelligence safely to scale.

[It takes a village]{.underline}

[The world is moving at the speed of light towards a **more
technologised state**. We can call it the digital revolution, the fourth
industrial revolution, or the computer age (if you're of a certain
vintage).]{.underline}

[I imagine this is a future where **artificial intelligence goes to
scale**. I am not talking generalised intelligence and singularity. I'm
talking about that time in between, where AI engines are sophisticated
enough to get put into lots of machines and autonomous systems, and into
the world around us. And start --- inevitably imperfectly --- making
decisions that affect people's lives. That is a very complex
future.]{.underline}

[If we translate the skills we have today onto that future, **we come up
short**]{.underline}. We have lawyers who are trying to regulate
configurations of technologies they don't understand. We have computer
programmers who are coding algorithms for machines they are not sure how
will act in response to algorithmic output. And we have engineering
teams trying to put autonomous vehicles on roads who don't understand
the social and political context of transport.

[I believe that the world needs a new way of thinking to tackle these
coming challenges. I think the answer lies with a re-imagining of
**cybernetics** and re-capturing the systems theory core of that nascent
conversation. This new body of knowledge would be more closely tied to
Wiener's notion of cybernetics, which, for all its madness, can be
re-interpreted for the 21st century in ways that we desperately
need.]{.underline}

The practitioners in the new field will have to be able to ask the right
questions. They will integrate scientific insights across disciplines
examining intelligence, including computer science, systems theory,
psychology, anthropology, the law and so on. And they must use them in a
practical decision-making framework that will assist them to design,
build, scale, manage, regulate and decommission cyber-physical systems
(autonomous systems super-charged by AI and the Internet of Things).

[When we build, every step of the way is a decision with real-world
impact. We must equip our engineers with the skills they need to bring
in diverse voices and make good decisions at every point. **We need
thinkers who see the whole**. Genuine, society-wide innovation is
different to making gadgets. It is hard work. And **it is better with
more voices than fewer**. It is part luck, part hubris]{.underline}. A
willingness to fail a little, to be reborn as something else. It is also
persistence and purpose.

I hope we are up for the challenge!

#### AI solves every existential threat and inevitable death -- leads to immortality

**Tzimas 21** (Themistoklis Tzimas PhD - post- doc researcher in
international law at the University of Macedonia and assistant professor

Ethical Challenges of Artificial Intelligence from an International Law
Perspective", Law Governance and Technology Series Volume 46, 30 July

<https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-78585-7_7#DOI>,
MG)

However, we need to consider the expectations as well. [The positive
side focuses on the so-called [friendly AI,]{.mark} meaning AI which
**will [benefit and not harm humans]{.mark}**, thanks to its advanced
intelligence.23]{.underline}

[[AI]{.mark} bears the [promise]{.mark} of significantly [enhancing
human life]{.mark} on various aspects, beginning from the already
existing, narrow applications. The enhanced automation24 in the industry
and the shift to autonomy,]{.underline}25 the take---over by AI of tasks
even at the service sector which can be considered as "tedious"---i.e.
in the banking sector---[**[climate]{.mark}** and weather forecasting,
**[disaster response]{.mark}**,26 the potentially **[better
coop]{.mark}eration** among different actors in complicated matters such
as in matters of information, [geopolitics]{.mark} and international
relations, logistics, [resources]{.mark} ex.27]{.underline}

The realization of the positive expectations depends up to some extent
upon the complementarity or not, of AI with human intelligence. However,
what friendly AI will bring in our societies constitutes a matter of
debate, given our lack of unanimous approach on what should be
considered as beneficial and therefore friendly to humans---as is
analyzed in the next chapter.

[[Friendly AI]{.mark} for example bears the prospect of [free]{.mark}ing
[us from hard]{.mark} labor [or]{.mark} even further from [unwanted
labor]{.mark};]{.underline} of generating further economic growth; of
dealing in unbiased, speedy, effective and cheaper ways with sectors
such as policing, [justice, [health, **environmental crisis, natural
disasters**, education, governance, defense]{.mark} and several more of
them which necessitate decision-making, with the involvement of
sophisticated intelligence.]{.underline}

The synergies between human intelligence and AI "promise" the
enhancement of humans in most of their aspects. Such synergies may
remain external---humans using AI as external to themselves, in terms of
analysis, forecasts, decision---making and in general as a type of
assistant28 or may evolve into the merging of the two forms of
intelligence either temporarily or permanently.

The second profoundly enters humanity, existentially---speaking, into
uncharted waters. Elon Musk argues in favor of "having some sort of
merger of biological intelligence and machine intelligence" and his
company "Neuralink" aims at implanting chips in human brain. Musk argues
that through this way humans will keep artificial intelligence under
control.29 The proposition is that of "mind design", with humans playing
the role that God had according to theologies.30

While the temptation is strong---exceeding human mind's capacities, far
beyond what nature "created", by acquiring the capacity for example to
connect directly to the cyberspace or to break the barriers of
biology31---the risks are significant too: what if a microchip
malfunction? Will such a brain be usurped or become captive to
malfunctioning AI?

The merging of the two intelligences is most likely to evolve initially
by invoking medical reasons, instead of human enhancement. But the
merging of the two will most likely continue, as after all the limits
between healing and enhancement are most often blurry. This development
will give rise, as is analyzed below, to significant questions and
issues, the most of crucial of which is the setting of a threshold for
the prevalence of the human aspect of intelligence over the artificial
one.

[[Human nature]{.mark} is historically improved, enhanced, healed and
now, potentially even [re-designed]{.mark} in the future.32]{.underline}
Can a "medical science" endorsing such a goal be ethically acceptable
and if yes, under what conditions, when, for whom and by what means? The
answers are more difficult than it seems. As the World Health
Organization---WHO---provides in its constitution, "Health is a state of
complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the
absence of disease or infirmity". 33

Therefore, why discourage science which aims at human-enhancement, even
reaching the levels of post-humanism?34 Or if restrictions are to be
imposed on human enhancement, on what ethics and laws will they be
justified? How ethically acceptable is it to prohibit or delay
technological evolution, which among several other magnificent
achievements, [promises to **[treat death as a disease and cure
it]{.mark},** by reducing soul to self, self to mind, and mind to brain,
which will then be preserved as a "softwarized" program in a hardware
other than the human body?35]{.underline}

After all, "According to the strong artificial intelligence program
there is no fundamental difference between computers and brains: a
computer is different machinery than a person in terms of speed and
memory capacity." 36

While such a scientific development and the ones leading potentially to
it will be undoubtedly, groundbreaking technologically-speaking, is it
actually---ethicallyspeaking---as ambivalent as it may sound or is it
already justified by our well--- rooted human-centrism?37

Secular humanism may have very well outdated religious beliefs about
afterlife in the area of science but has [not diminished **[the hope for
immortality]{.mark}**; on the contrary, science, implicitly or
explicitly predicts that [matter can]{.mark} in various ways [surpass
death]{.mark}, albeit by means which belong in the realm of scientific
proof, instead of that of metaphysical belief.38]{.underline}

[If this is the philosophical case, **the quest for [immortality]{.mark}
becomes [ethically acceptable]{.mark}**; it can be considered as
[embedded]{.mark} both [in]{.mark} the [existential anxiety]{.mark} of
humans, as well as in the human-centrism of secular philosophical and
political victory over the dei-centric approach to the world and to our
existence.]{.underline}

From another perspective of course and for the not that distant
philosophical reasons, the quest for immortality becomes ethically
ambiguous or even unacceptable.39 By seeking endless life we may miss
all these that make life worth living in the framework of finiteness. As
the gerontologist Paul Hayflick cautioned "Given the possibility that
you could replace all your parts, including your brain, then you lose
your self-identity, your self-recognition. You lose who you are! You are
who you are because of your memory." 40

In other words, once we begin to integrate the two types of
intelligence, within ourselves, until when and how we will be sure that
it is human intelligence that guides us, instead of the AI? And if we
are not guided completely or---even further---at all by human
intelligence but on the contrary we are guided by AI which we have
embodied and which is trained by our human intelligence, will we be
remaining humans or we will have evolved to some type of meta-human or
transhumant species, being different persons as well?41

AI promises tor threatens to offer a solution by breaking down our
consciousness into small "particles" of information---simplistically
speaking---which can then be "software-ized" and therefore "uploaded"
into different forms of physical or non-physical existence.

[Diane Ackerman states that "The brain is silent, the brain is dark, the
brain tastes nothing, the brain hears nothing. All it receives are
electrical impulses\--not the sumptuous chocolate melting sweetly, not
the oboe solo like the flight of a bird, not the pastel pink and
lavender sunset over the coral reef\--only impulses." 42 Therefore, all
that is needed---although it is of course much more complicated than we
can imagine---is a way to code and reproduce such impulses.]{.underline}

Even if we consider that without death, we will no more be humans but
something else, why should we remain humans once technologies allow us
be something "more", in the sense of an enhanced version of "being"? Why
are we to remain bound by biological evolution if we can re-design it
and our future form of existence?

[Why not try to achieve the major breakthrough, the anticipated or hoped
[digitalization]{.mark} of the human mind, which **[promises
immortality]{.mark}** of consciousness via the cyberspace or artificial
bodies: the uploading of our consciousness so that it can live on
forever, [turning **death into an optional
condition**]{.mark}.43]{.underline}

[Either through an artificial body or emulation-a living, conscious
avatar---we hope---or fear---that **[the domain of immortality will be
within reach]{.mark}**. It is the prospect of a "substrate-independent
minds," in which human and machine consciousness will merge,
transcending biological limits of time, space and memory" that
fascinates us.44]{.underline}

#### Using technical data and information to drive policymaking is good

**Reiter 15**---Professor of Political Science at Emory University
\[Dan, "Scholars Help Policymakers Know Their Tools," *War on the
Rocks*, 27 Aug,
<https://warontherocks.com/2015/08/scholars-help-policymakers-know-their-tools/>,
accessed 11 Jan 2017\]

This critique is both narrowly true and narrow in perspective. [Context
is]{.underline} of course [important, but foreign [policy choices are
**not sui generis**]{.mark}, there are [patterns]{.mark} across space
and time that **[inform decision-making]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Policymakers recognize this and routinely draw lessons from history when
making foreign policy decisions. As noted below, policymakers in other
areas such as development and public health routinely rely on broader,
more general studies to craft policy. And, [[**broader scholarship** can
**improve** foreign policy performance]{.mark}, as [evidenced by the
ability of]{.mark} IR [academics to build on their]{.mark} own [work to
**predict outcomes**]{.mark}, including for example forecasting the
lengths of the conventional and insurgency phases of the U.S.--Iraq
conflict in the 2000s]{.underline}.

But, even if one were to accept the limits of general work, there is a
growing body of academic work that evaluates foreign policy tools as
applied to a specific country or region. These studies ask questions
such as whether:

Development projects reduced insurgent violence in Afghanistan; Drone
strikes reduced insurgent violence in Pakistan; Development programs
increased civic participation and social capital in Sudan; Building cell
phone towers in Iraq reduced insurgent violence; Attempts to reintegrate
combatants into society in Burundi succeeded; Security sector reform in
Liberia increased the legitimacy of the government there; Road projects
in India reduced insurgent violence; We can understand peacekeeping's
failure in Congo; Israel's targeted assassinations reduced violent
attacks from militants.

This is not by any means a dismissal of professional intelligence work.
Academics are not intelligence analysts: They do not have access to
contemporary intelligence data, nor are they generally trained to do
things like examine the latest satellite photos of North Korean nuclear
activities and make judgments about North Korea's current plutonium
production. And certainly, academic IR work can never replace
professional intelligence work. But the best policy decisions marry
timely, specific intelligence with academic work that has a more general
perspective.

A third critique is that much of this academic work on foreign policy
tools is unusable by policymakers because it is too quantitative and
technically complex. Here, echoing a point made by Erik Voeten, [[there
is a **danger** in **not appreciating** the importance of rigorous
research design]{.mark}, including sophisticated [quantitative
techniques, for **crafting effective policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Sophisticated [research]{.mark} design is not the enemy of effective
policy, it [is **critically necessary**]{.mark} for it]{.underline}.
Certainly, [the current academic focus on building research designs that
permit causal inference speaks exactly to what policymakers care about
the most: if implementing a certain policy will cause the desired
outcome]{.underline}.

Or, put differently, [**[bad research]{.mark}** designs [make for **bad
public policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A classic example is school
busing]{.underline}. [In the]{.underline} 19[60s]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} early 19[70s]{.underline}, [some cities adopted
voluntary integration programs for public schools]{.underline}, in which
families could volunteer to bus their children to schools in
neighborhoods with different racial majorities. [Policymakers used the
favorable results for the voluntary programs to make the improper
inference that mandatory busing policies would also work]{.underline}.
[The result was bad public policy and violence]{.underline} in the
streets.

[Sophisticated [technical methods]{.mark} can [improve our ability to
make **causal inferences**, and]{.mark}]{.underline} can help
[[solve]{.underline}]{.mark} other **[[empirical
problems]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Consider that the heart of successful
counterinsurgency is, according to U.S. military doctrine, winning the
support of the population. [Assessing whether certain policies do win
public support requires collecting opinion data]{.underline}. A
conventional method for measuring popular opinion is the survey, but of
course, individuals in insurgency-stricken areas may be unwilling to
reveal their true opinions to a survey-taker out of fear for their
personal safety. [Methodologists have crafted sophisticated techniques
for addressing this issue, improving our ability to measure public
support for the government in these areas]{.underline}. These techniques
have been used to assess better the determinants of public support in
insurgency-affected countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India.

[Going forward, we will continue to need advanced methodologies to
address pressing policy questions]{.underline}. Consider the U.S.
military's commitment to gender integration. The implementation of this
commitment will be best informed if it rests on rigorous social science
that address outstanding questions. Is there a Sacagawea effect, in
which mixed gender units engaged in counterinsurgency are more effective
than male-only units? How might mixed gender affect small unit cohesion
in combat? How might mixed gender units reduce the incidence of sexual
assault, both within the military and of assault committed by troops
against civilians?

[Certainly, **[other areas]{.mark}** of public policy [understand the
importance]{.mark} of rigorous research design]{.underline}. [Economic
and development policy communities read the work of and employ economics
Ph.D.s.]{.underline} [[Policymakers incorporate the findings of]{.mark}
sophisticated [studies on policy areas such as **microfinance**,
**gender empowerment**, and **foreign aid**]{.mark}, knowing the best
policy decisions must incorporate these studies' findings]{.underline}.

Or consider public health policy. [**[Lives are literally on the
line]{.mark}** as [decision-makers must make decisions about]{.mark}
issues such as [**vaccinations**, **nutritional recommendations**, and
**air quality**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Policymakers know they must use
sophisticated technical studies executed by epidemiologists and other
public health academics to craft the best policies]{.underline}.

Critics will argue that some U.S. policymakers remain alienated from
contemporary academic IR work, with the suggestion that if IR academics
let go of an obsession with technique, they will then be better able to
connect with policymakers and help them craft better policy. I agree
that IR academics need to find ways to communicate their results in
clear, non-technical language. But [[the **technical
components**]{.mark} of the work **[need to be
there]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Stripping them out **directly
undermines** the ability of the research to give the **right**]{.mark}
kinds of policy **[recommendations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Let me conclude by noting that I am sympathetic to the concern that IR
academics should think about the big picture as well as smaller
questions, the forest of grand strategy as well as the trees of foreign
policy tools. [IR [academics have the potential to **make real
contributions** to]{.mark} big picture
**[debates]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to think hard about the essence of
grand strategy by assembling a framework that effectively integrates
foreign policy means and ends. [The nature of the IR subfield and its
integration of political economy and security, and its ability to think
about structure as well as units, make it especially well positioned to
consider these broad questions]{.underline}. The ability of IR academics
to contribute to contemporary foreign policy debates is one of many
reasons why [political science should retain]{.underline} the subfield
of [IR and resist the temptation to replace the traditional empirical
subfields]{.underline} of IR, comparative, and American [with new
subfields of conflict, political economy, behavior, and
institutions]{.underline}.

Like good carpenters, [foreign policymakers need to know their
tools]{.underline}. [Rigorous IR research is the only way to evaluate
them effectively]{.underline}.

#### [Unsustainability]{.underline} claims are suspect because our brains are wired for [techno-pessimism]{.underline} -- digital synchronicity can [fix]{.underline} racism embedded in cybernetics thru [human ingenuity]{.underline} and make the world [materially]{.underline} better

[[Many are]{.underline}]{.mark} understandably [[pessimistic
about]{.underline}]{.mark} platforms and
[[tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}. This year has been a tough one, [from
Cambridge Analytica and Russian trolls to]{.underline} the
implementation of [GDPR and data breaches]{.underline} galore. Those who
think about the world, about the problems that we see every day, and
about their own place in it, will quickly realize the immense frailty of
humankind. Fear and worry makes sense. We are flawed, each one of us.
And technology only seems to exacerbate those problems. [[But life is
getting better]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Poverty continues
nose-diving]{.mark};]{.underline} adult literacy is at an all-time high;
[[people]{.mark} around the world [are living
longer]{.mark}]{.underline}, living in democracies, and are better
educated than at any other time in history. Meanwhile, [[the digital
revolution has resulted in]{.underline}]{.mark} a glut of
[[informational abundance, helping to correct]{.mark} the informational
[asymmetries that]{.mark} have long [plagued
humankind]{.mark}]{.underline}. The problem we now face is not how to
address informational constraints, but how to provide the means for
people to sort through and make sense of this abundant trove of data.
These macro trends don't make headlines. [[Psychologists know]{.mark}
that people love to read negative articles. [Our brains are wired for
pessimism]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the shadow of a year of bad news, it
helpful to remember that Facebook and Google and Reddit and Twitter also
support humane conversations. Most people aren't going online to talk
about politics and if you are, then you are rare. These sites are places
where families and friends can connect. They offer a space of solace --
like when chronic pain sufferers find others on Facebook, or when widows
vent, rage, laugh and cry without judgement through the Hot Young Widows
Club. Let's also not forget that Reddit, while sometimes a place of rage
and spite, is also where a weight lifter with cerebral palsy can become
a hero and where those with addiction can find healing. And in the
hardest to reach places in Canada, in Iqaluit, people say that "Amazon
Prime has done more toward elevating the standard of living of my family
than any territorial or federal program. Full stop. Period"
Three-fourths of Americans say major technology companies' products and
services have been more good than bad for them personally. But when it
comes to the whole of society, they are more skeptical about technology
bringing benefits. Here is how I read that disparity: Most of us think
that we have benefited from technology, but we worry about where it is
taking the human collective. That is an understandable worry, but one
that shouldn't hobble us to inaction. Nor is technology making us
stupid. Indeed, quite the opposite is happening. Technology use in those
aged 50 and above seems to have caused them to be cognitively younger
than their parents to the tune of 4 to 8 years. While the use of Google
does seem to reduce our ability to recall information, studies find that
it has boosted other kinds of memory, like retrieving information. Why
remember a fact when you can remember where it is located? Concerned how
audiobooks might be affecting people, Beth Rogowsky, an associate
professor of education, compared them to physical reading and was
surprised to find "no significant differences in comprehension between
reading, listening, or reading and listening simultaneously."
Cyberbullying and excessive use might make parents worry, but NIH
supported work found that "Heavy use of the Internet and video gaming
may be more a symptom of mental health problems than a cause. Moderate
use of the Internet, especially for acquiring information, is most
supportive of healthy development." Don't worry. The kids are going to
be alright. And [yes, [there is a lot]{.mark} we still need [to fix.
There is]{.mark} cruelty, [racism]{.mark}, sexism, and poverty of all
kinds [embedded in]{.mark} our [tech]{.mark}nological [systems]{.mark}.
But [the best way to handle]{.mark} these [issues is]{.mark} through the
application of [human ingenuity]{.mark}. Human ingenuity begets
technology in all of its varieties]{.underline}. When Scott Alexander
over at Star Slate Codex recently looked at 52
[[startups]{.underline}]{.mark} being groomed by startup incubator Y
Combinator, he rightly pointed out that many of them were working for
the betterment of all: Thirteen of them [[had an
altruistic]{.underline}]{.mark} or international development
[[focus]{.underline}]{.mark}, including Neema, an app to help poor
people without access to banks gain financial services; Kangpe,
[[online]{.mark} health [services for people]{.mark} in Africa [without
access to doctors]{.mark}]{.underline}; Credy, a peer-to-peer lending
service in India; Clear Genetics, [[an automated gene]{.mark}tic
[counseling tool]{.mark} for at-risk parents]{.underline}; and Dost
Education, helping to teach literacy skills in India via a \$1/month
course. Twelve of them seemed like really exciting cutting-edge
technology, including CBAS, which describes itself as "human bionics
plug-and-play"; Solugen, which has a way to manufacture hydrogen
peroxide from plant sugars; AON3D, which makes 3D printers for
industrial uses; Indee, a new genetic engineering system; Alem Health,
applying AI to radiology, and of course the obligatory drone delivery
startup. Eighteen of them seemed like boring meat-and-potatoes companies
aimed at businesses that need enterprise data solution software
application package analytics targeting management something something
something "the cloud". As for the other companies, they were the kind of
niche products that Silicon Valley has come to be criticized for
supporting. [Perhaps the Valley deserves some criticism, but perhaps it
deserves more credit than it's been receiving as-of-late. Contemporary
tech criticism displays a kind of anti-nostalgia]{.underline}. Instead
of being reverent for the past, anxiety for the future abounds. In these
visions, the future is imagined as a strange, foreign land, beset with
problems. And yet, to quote that old adage, tomorrow is the visitor that
is always coming but never arrives. The future never arrives because we
are assembling it today. We need to work diligently together to piece
together a better world. [But [if we]{.mark} constantly [live in fear of
what comes next]{.mark}, [that future won't be built. Optimism needn't
be pollyannaish]{.mark}. It only needs to be hopeful of a better
world]{.underline}.

#### Conversations are uniquely key towards making the AI cybernetic world possible

**Bell 20** (Genevieve Bell -- Distinguished Professor and Violet
McKenzie Chair at the Australian National University, "Why we need a
cybernetic future", Australian National University, 14 November 2020,
<https://cybernetics.anu.edu.au/2020/11/14/why-we-need-cybernetic-future/>,
MG)

[Making cybernetics real, however, required **more** than just a name.
It required **conversations**]{.underline}, champions, [and **framing
questions** in such a way as to reveal the edges of the cybernetics
potential]{.underline}. From 1946 to 1953 a series of conferences took
place to try to do just that. Created and curated by anthropologists
Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, in collaboration with Wiener, these
conferences, later known as the Macy cybernetics conferences, took place
in New York. And the participants were strikingly diverse --- there were
mathematicians and philosophers, physicists and psychologists,
anthropologists and historians, hailing from North America including
Mexico, Europe and Asia. They were at different points in their careers
and they had different lived experiences. What Mead, Bateson and Wiener
knew was that building something new like this was not a task for one
scientific discipline. It could, in fact, only be built in the
intersections between fields and existing ideas.

Cybernetics or AI?

In 1953 the Macy Conferences came to an end but the conversations
didn't. And in 1956, 10 years after Wiener had coined the term
cybernetics, a new term would come to take its place: "artificial
intelligence". This, too, was born at a conference of sorts, the
Dartmouth Summer Research Project. The proposal for the project stated
that:

["The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every
aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle
be so precisely described that a **machine can be made to simulate
it."**]{.underline}

[The future was being built, again, but this time with fewer voices, and
fewer questions. This group, it seemed, already knew the answers ---
make a machine that can think like a human. Indeed, many ideas were lost
in the transition from cybernetics to artificial intelligence, such as
the idea of dynamic systems that included technology, people and
ecology; the idea of feedback; and the idea that the world you were
making should be subject to critical inquiry.]{.underline}

[The thing about ideas, though, is that **they move, grow and adapt**.
Your ideas will always end up in someone else's hands and, when they do,
you hope you gave them enough grace and enough shape to hold
up.]{.underline} Mary Catherine Bateson, daughter of Gregory Bateson and
Margaret Mead, wrote of the moment cybernetics gave way to artificial
intelligence:

["The tragedy of the cybernetic revolution, which had two phases, the
computer science side and the systems theory side, has been the neglect
of the systems theory side of it. We chose marketable gadgets in
preference to a **deeper understanding of the world we live
in."**]{.underline}

2\. What Is GCR And Why Is It Important? [Taken **literally**, a global
catastrophe can be any event that is in some way catastrophic across the
globe]{.underline}. [This suggests a rather low threshold]{.underline}
for what counts as a global catastrophe. An event causing just one death
on each continent (say, from a jet-setting assassin) could rate as a
global catastrophe, because surely these deaths would be catastrophic
for the deceased and their loved ones. [However, in common usage, a
global catastrophe would be **catastrophic** for a significant portion
of the globe]{.underline}. Minimum thresholds have variously been set
around ten thousand to ten million deaths or \$10 billion to \$10
trillion in damages (Bostrom and Ćirković 2008), or death of one quarter
of the human population (Atkinson 1999; Hempsell 2004). [Others have
emphasized catastrophes that cause **long-term declines in the
trajectory of human civilization**]{.underline} (Beckstead 2013), [that
human civilization **does not recover from**]{.underline} (Maher and
Baum 2013), [that drastically reduce humanity's potential for future
achievements]{.underline} ([Bostrom]{.underline} 2002, [using the term
"**existential risk**"), or that result in **human
extinction**]{.underline} (Matheny 2007; Posner 2004). [A common theme
across all these treatments of GCR is that **[some catastrophes are
vastly more important than others]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Carl Sagan was
perhaps the first to recognize this, in his commentary on nuclear winter
(Sagan 1983). [Without nuclear winter, a [global nuclear war]{.mark}
might kill several hundred million people. This is obviously a major
catastrophe, but humanity would presumably carry on. However,
[with]{.mark} **[nuclear winter]{.mark}**]{.underline}, per Sagan,
[**[humanity]{.mark} could [go extinct]{.mark}**. The loss would be not
just an additional four billion or so deaths, but the [loss of **all
future generations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To paraphrase Sagan, [the
loss would be billions and billions of lives, or even
**more**]{.underline}. [Sagan estimated **[500 trillion lives]{.mark}**,
assuming humanity would continue for ten million more years, which he
cited as typical for a successful species. Sagan's 500 trillion number
may even be [an **underestimate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The analysis
here takes an adventurous turn, hinging on the evolution of the human
species and the long-term fate of the universe. On these long time
scales, the descendants of contemporary humans may no longer be
recognizably "human". The issue then is whether the descendants are
still worth caring about, whatever they are. If they are, then it begs
the question of how many of them there will be. Barring major global
catastrophe, Earth will remain habitable for about one billion more
years 2 until the Sun gets too warm and large. The rest of the Solar
System, Milky Way galaxy, universe, and (if it exists) the multiverse
will remain habitable for a lot longer than that (Adams and Laughlin
1997), should our descendants gain the capacity to migrate there. [An
open question in astronomy is whether it is possible for the descendants
of humanity to continue living for an **infinite length of time** or
instead merely an **astronomically large but finite** length of
time]{.underline} (see e.g. Ćirković 2002; Kaku 2005). Either way, [the
stakes with global catastrophes **could** be **much larger than the loss
of 500 trillion lives.** Debates about the infinite vs. the merely
astronomical are of theoretical interest]{.underline} (Ng 1991; Bossert
et al. 2007), [but they have **limited practical significance**. This
can be seen when **evaluating GCRs from a standard
[risk-equals-probability-times-magnitude]{.mark} framework**. Using
Sagan's 500 trillion lives estimate, it follows that reducing the
probability of global catastrophe by a mere one-in-500-trillion chance
is of the same significance as saving one human life. Phrased
differently, [society should **try 500 trillion times harder to prevent
a global catastrophe than**]{.mark} **it should to [save a person's
life]{.mark}**. Or, preventing one million deaths is equivalent to a
one-in500-million reduction in the probability of global catastrophe.
This suggests [society should **make**]{.mark} **extremely large
[investment in GCR reduction]{.mark}, [at the expense of]{.mark}
virtually [all other objectives]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Judge and legal
scholar Richard Posner made a similar point in monetary terms (Posner
2004). Posner used \$50,000 as the value of a statistical human life
(VSL) and 12 billion humans as the total loss of life (double the 2004
world population); he describes both figures as significant
underestimates. Multiplying them gives \$600 trillion as an
underestimate of the value of preventing global catastrophe. For
comparison, the United States government typically uses a VSL of around
one to ten million dollars (Robinson 2007). Multiplying a \$10 million
VSL with 500 trillion lives gives \$5x1021 as the value of preventing
global catastrophe. But even using "just\" \$600 trillion, [society
should be willing to spend]{.underline} at least that much to prevent a
global catastrophe, which converts to being willing to spend at least
[\$1 million for a one-in-500-million reduction in the probability of
global catastrophe]{.underline}. Thus [while reasonable disagreement
exists on how large of a VSL to use and how much to count future
generations, even low-end positions suggest **vast resource
allocations** should be redirected to reducing GCR. This conclusion is
only **strengthened** when considering the **astronomical size of the
stakes**]{.underline}, but the same point holds either way. The bottom
line is that, [as long as something along the lines of the standard
riskequals-probability-times-magnitude framework is being used, then
**even tiny GCR reductions** merit significant effort. This point holds
especially strongly for risks of catastrophes that would cause
**permanent harm to global human civilization**. The discussion thus far
has assumed that all human lives are valued equally. This assumption is
**not universally held**]{.underline}. [People often value some people
more than others]{.underline}, favoring themselves, their family and
friends, their compatriots, their generation, or others whom they
identify with. [Great debates rage on across moral philosophy,
economics, and other fields about how much people should value
others]{.underline} who are distant in space, time, or social relation,
as well as the unborn members of future generations. [This debate is
crucial]{.underline} for all valuations of risk, including GCR. Indeed,
if each of us only cares about our immediate selves, then global
catastrophes may not be especially important, and we probably have
better things to do with our time than worry about them. [While everyone
has the right to their **own views and feelings**]{.underline}, we find
that [the strongest arguments are for the **widely held position** that
**[all human lives should be valued equally]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This
position is succinctly stated in the United States Declaration of
Independence, updated in the 1848 Declaration of Sentiments: "We hold
these truths to be self-evident: that all men and 3 women are created
equal". [Philosophers speak of an agent-neutral, objective "view from
nowhere"]{.underline} (Nagel 1986) [or a "veil of
ignorance"]{.underline} (Rawls 1971) [in which each person considers
what is best for society **irrespective of which member of society they
happen to be**]{.underline}. [Such a perspective **suggests [valuing
everyone equally]{.mark}**, regardless of who they are or where or when
they live. This in turn [suggests a]{.mark} **very [high value for
reducing GCR]{.mark}**, or a high degree of priority for GCR reduction
efforts.]{.underline}

our chances of improving and saving lives, creating a healthier world
and making businesses more efficient, [the better chance we have to
stall or even reverse the climate change trajectory we're
on]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Here are just a few of the ways AI and
machine learning are helping us tackle climate change. Machines can
analyze the flood of data that is generated every day from sensors,
gauges and monitors to spot patterns quickly and automatically. [By
looking at data about the changing conditions of the world's land
surfaces]{.underline} that is gathered by NASA and aggregated at
Landsat, [[it provides]{.mark} a very [accurate]{.mark} [picture]{.mark}
of how the world is changing.]{.underline} The more accurate we're able
to be at the current status of our climate, the better our climate
models will be. [This information can be used to identify our biggest
vulnerabilities and risk zones.]{.underline} **[This [knowledge]{.mark}
from climate scientists can [be shared]{.mark} [with decision-makers so
they know how to respond]{.mark} to the impact of climate
change---severe weather such as hurricanes, rising sea levels and higher
temperatures.]{.underline}** [Artificial intelligence and deep learning
can help climate researchers and innovators test out their theories and
solutions about how to reduce air pollution and other climate-friendly
innovations.]{.underline} One example of this is the Green Horizon
Project from IBM that analyzes environmental data and predicts pollution
as well as tests "what-if" scenarios that involve pollution-reducing
tactics. By using the information provided by machine learning
algorithms, Google was able to cut the amount of energy it used at its
data centers by 15%. Similar insights can help other companies reduce
their carbon footprint. While businesses and manufacturing might
contribute significantly to greenhouse gas levels, it's still imperative
that each citizen commits to reducing their impact as well. The easier
we make green initiatives for each person, the higher the adoption rate
and the more progress we make to save the environment. [Artificial
intelligence and machine learning innovations can help create products
and services that make it easier to take care of our
planet]{.underline}. There are several consumer-facing [AI]{.underline}
devices such as smart thermostats (which could save up to 15% on cooling
annually for each household) and irrigation systems (which could save up
to 8,800 gallons of water per home per year) that [help conserve
resources.]{.underline} Everyone doing their part over time will add up.
The damage to human lives and property can be reduced if there are
earlier warning signs of a catastrophic weather event. There has been
significant progress in using machine-learning algorithms that were
trained on data from other extreme weather events to identify tropical
cyclones and atmospheric rivers. **[[The earlier warning]{.mark} that
[governments]{.mark} and citizens [can get]{.mark} about severe weather,
[the better the]{.mark}y [are able to respond]{.mark} and protect
themselves.]{.underline}** Machines are also being deployed to assess
the strengths of models that are used to investigate climate change by
reviewing the dozens of them that are in use and extracting intelligence
from them. They also help predict how long a storm will last and its
severity. Since machines can't tell you "how" it arrived at its
prediction or decisions, most climate professionals don't feel
comfortable relying on only what the machines suggest will happen, but
use machine insight along with their own professional analysis to
complement one another. Climate change is a gargantuan problem and its
complexity is exacerbated by the many people and players involved from
divergent worldwide government entities to profit-driven corporations
and individuals who aren't always open to change. Therefore, **[the
[faster]{.mark} and smarter [we can beco]{.mark}me through the use of AI
and machine learning [the higher our probability of success to at least
slow down the damage caused by climate change.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

2018; Osmond and Klausmeier, 2017; Rothman, 2017; Schuur et al., 2015;
Sims and Finnoff, 2016; Van Aalst, 2006).7

[A possibly]{.underline} **[imminent]{.underline}** [tipping point could
be in the form of 'an]{.underline} **[[abrupt ice sheet

[cause]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[[rapid sea]{.mark} level

are]{.underline} **[many avenues]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[positive feedback]{.underline}** in global warming,
[including:]{.underline}

[Though there are also avenues for]{.underline}
**[negative]{.underline}** [feedback, the]{.underline} **[scientific
consensus]{.underline}** [is for an]{.underline} **[overall net positive
feedback]{.underline}** (Roe and Baker, 2007). [Thus]{.underline}, the
Global Challenges Foundation (2017, p. 25) concludes, '[The world is
currently]{.underline} **[completely unprepared]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} envisage, and even less **[deal with]{.underline}**,
the consequences of **[CCC']{.underline}**.

[The threat of sea-level rising from global warming is well known, but
there are also other likely and more imminent threats to the
survivability of mankind and other living things. For
example]{.underline}, Sherwood and Huber (2010) emphasize
[the]{.underline} **[adaptability limit]{.underline}** [to climate
change due to]{.underline} **[heat stress]{.underline}** [from high
environmental wet-bulb temperature.]{.underline} They show that
['[even]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[modest]{.underline}**]{.mark} global

fractions of the]{.underline} \[world\] [[population
to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[unprecedented [heat
stress']{.mark}]{.underline}** p. 9552 and that [with substantial global
warming, 'the area of land rendered **uninhabitable by heat stress**

**[sea level']{.underline}** p. 9555, [[making]{.underline}
**[extinction]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[much more
[likely]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the relatively moderate damages
estimated by most integrated assessment models unreliably low.

[While]{.underline} **[imminent]{.underline}** [extinction
is]{.underline} very [unlikely]{.underline} and may not come for a long
time even under business as usual, the main point is that
[we]{.underline} **[cannot rule it out]{.underline}**. Annan and
Hargreaves (2011, pp. 434--435) may be right that [there is 'an upper 95
per cent probability limit for S \[temperature increase\] \... to lie
close to 4°C, and certainly well below 6°C'. However, probabilities of 5
per cent, 0.5 per cent, 0.05 per cent or even 0.005 per cent of
excessive warming and the resulting extinction probabilities **cannot be
ruled out**]{.underline} [and are]{.underline} [**unacceptable**. Even
if there is only a]{.underline} **[1 per cent probability]{.underline}**
[that there is a]{.underline} time **[bomb in the]{.underline}**

James **Tully 6**, "Communication and Imperialism," CTheory, 2-22-2006,
http://ctheory.net/communication-and-imperialism/

[Arthur [**Kroker** suggests]{.mark} that the genetic engineering of the
"codes" of life in humans and other organic resources, at one end, and
the monitoring, surveillance and precision targeting of the global
population in space-based network warfare through full spectrum global
dominance at the other, represent the two extremes of [this way of being
in the world]{.mark}]{.underline} (legitimated in terms of "openness" of
scientific inquiry and "security" of individuals and the species). Here
life itself is pictured as both a network and an object of manipulation
and control by informational technologies. Human nature and the
environment are absorbed into culture, and so culture/nature is pictured
as a kind of standing reserve of manipulable networks. \[21\] \[22\]
[This is not a form of subjectivity and intersubjectivity that a person
bears in one particular role among many. It [is a **communicative
habitus** that **communicators**]{.mark} tend to [**operate within** at
**work and leisure**]{.mark}, on the home computer, the cell phone, the
wireless laptop, and the BlackBerry. When networkers put these more
interactive modes of communication down, they tend to turn to the
technology of the communication of "affects": radio, television, movies
and videos. As a result, this worldview and skill set is carried into
other areas of life, either colonizing them or disregarding them if they
are inaccessible through the network technology]{.underline}. [[The form
of subjectivity]{.mark} and intersubjectivity of network communicators
[is not an ideology]{.mark} or a worldview in the traditional sense. [It
is rather the opposite: a mode of being that is **skilled in**]{.mark}
and accustomed to **["worldviewing" --- surfing through]{.mark},
interacting with [and negotiating a kaleidoscope of shifting
ideologies]{.mark}** and worldviews. [Secular modernists]{.mark},
western [scientists]{.mark}, indigenous peoples, [neo-liberals]{.mark},
non-governmental organizations, [anti-globalization activists]{.mark},
hyper-globalisers, [deep ecologists]{.mark}, apocalyptic religious
fundamentalists in the Bush administration and Bin Laden terrorist
networks [are all]{.mark} at home [in this habitat]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Yet, it is not a neutral, all-inclusive medium of communication. It
substantially modifies the pre-network forms of subjectivity it
includes, transforming them into contingent and malleable worldviews,
civilizations, codes, programs, and "scapes", [[yet, **paradoxically,
placing beyond question its own background horizon of disclosure of the
world as a complex system of**]{.mark} **contingent and [programmable
networks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This taken-for-granted form of
subjectification tends to come with the network and goes without saying.
It is the characteristic form of subjectivity of network imperialism. We
are just beginning to study and make explicit the tacit ways
communication networks are re-organizing human subjectivity. Boaventura
de Sousa Santos and other [critical sociologists of network
communication and control argue that the net brings with it, in tandem
with programmability, other taken-for-granted ways of organizing and
imagining experience, privileging certain forms of communication,
communicative rationality, knowledge, problem solving, cooperation and
competition]{.underline}, and production and consumption, and
discounting or excluding others.\[23\] [Finally, [although this is a
powerful]{.mark} new [form of]{.mark} subjectivity and [social ordering,
it is one form among many that we bear as modern subjects, and **we are
not passive recipients of it**]{.mark}]{.underline} (as we will see in
section 3).

### 1nc\-\--AT: Future Military Tech

#### No impact to future military tech -- it's non-unique and inevitable -- but, [testing]{.underline} and [safeguards]{.underline} solve. 

**Ackerman, 15**---senior writer for IEEE Spectrum's award-winning
robotics blog, Automaton (Evan, "We Should Not Ban 'Killer Robots,' and
Here's Why,"
<https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/artificial-intelligence/we-should-not-ban-killer-robots>,
dml)

The problem with this argument is that **[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}**
letter, [**UN [declaration]{.mark}**[, or]{.mark} even a **formal
[ban]{.mark}** ratified by multiple nations [is **going to
prevent**]{.mark} **people** from being able to build
[a]{.mark}utonomous, [w]{.mark}eaponized robot[s]{.mark}. [The
barriers]{.mark} keeping people from developing this kind of system
[are]{.mark} **just [too low]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Consider the "armed
quadcopters." Today you can buy a smartphone-controlled quadrotor for US
\$300 at Toys R Us. Just imagine what you'll be able to buy tomorrow.
[This [tech]{.mark}nology [**exists**. It's **improving**]{.mark} **all
the time**. [There's]{.mark} simply **[too much]{.mark} commercial
[value]{.mark}** in creating]{.underline} quadcopters (and other robots)
that have longer endurance, more autonomy, bigger payloads, and
[everything]{.underline} else [that you'd also want in a military
system]{.underline}. And at this point, it's entirely possible that
small commercial quadcopters are just as advanced as (and way cheaper
than) small military quadcopters, anyway. [[We're **not going to
stop**]{.mark} **that research**, though, because everybody wants
delivery drones (among other things)]{.underline}. Generally speaking,
technology itself is not inherently good or bad: it's what we choose to
do with it that's good or bad, and you can't just cover your eyes and
start screaming "STOP!!!" if you see something sinister on the horizon
when there's so much simultaneous potential for positive progress.

What [we really need]{.underline}, then, is [a way of making autonomous
armed robots **ethical**, because we're **not going to be able to
prevent them from existing**]{.underline}. In fact, [the most
significant assumption]{.underline} that this letter makes [is
[that]{.mark} armed autonomous [robots]{.mark} are **inherently more
likely to [cause]{.mark} unintended [destruction]{.mark}** and **death**
than armed autonomous humans are. This may or may not be the case right
now, and either way]{.underline}, I genuinely believe that [it **[won't
be the case]{.mark}** in the future, perhaps the **very near
future**]{.underline}. I think that [it will be possible for robots to
be **as good** (or **better**) at identifying hostile enemy combatants
as humans, since there are rules that can be followed]{.underline}
(called Rules of Engagement, for an example see page 27 of this) [to
determine whether or not using force is justified]{.underline}. For
example, does your target have a weapon? Is that weapon pointed at you?
Has the weapon been fired? Have you been hit? [These are all things that
a robot can determine using any number of sensors that currently
exist]{.underline}.

It's worth noting that Rules of Engagement generally allow for
engagement in the event of an imminent attack. In other words, if a
hostile target has a weapon and that weapon is pointed at you, you can
engage before the weapon is fired rather than after in the interests of
self-protection. [[Robots could]{.mark} be **even more
cautious**]{.underline} than this: [you could **program them to [not
engage a hostile target]{.mark} with deadly force** unless they confirm
with whatever level of certainty that you want that the target is
actively engaging them already]{.underline}. Since robots aren't alive
and don't have emotions and don't get tired or stressed or distracted,
[[it's possible]{.mark} for them [to]{.mark} **just [sit]{.mark}
there**, **[under fire]{.mark}**, until **all necessary criteria for
engagement** are met. [Humans **can't**]{.mark} **do
this**]{.underline}.

[The argument against this is that a robot autonomously making a
decision to engage a target with deadly force]{.underline}, no matter
how certain the robot may be, [is **dangerous** and
**unethical**]{.underline}. It is dangerous, and it may be unethical, as
well. [However, is it **any more dangerous** or **unethical than asking
a human to do the same thing**?]{.underline} The real question that we
should be asking is this: [Could autonomous armed [robots **perform
better** than]{.mark} armed [humans]{.mark} in combat, resulting in
**fewer casualties**]{.underline} (combatant or non-combatant) [on both
sides?]{.underline} I believe so, which doesn't really matter, but so do
people who are actually working on this stuff, which does.

In 2009, Ronald C. Arkin, Patrick Ulam, and Brittany Duncan published a
paper entitled "An Ethical Governor for Constraining Lethal Action in an
Autonomous System," which was about how to program an armed, autonomous
robot to act within the Laws of War and Rules of Engagement. h+ Magazine
interviewed Arkin on the subject (read the whole thing here), and here's
what he said:

h+: Some researchers assert that no robots or AI systems will be able to
discriminate between a combatant and an innocent, that this sensing
ability currently just does not exist. Do you think this is just a
short-term technology limitation? What such technological assumptions do
you make in the design of your ethical governor?

RA: I agree this discrimination technology does not effectively exist
today, nor is it intended that these systems should be fielded in
current conflicts. These are for the so-called war after next, and the
DoD would need to conduct extensive additional research in order to
develop the accompanying technology to support the proof-of-concept work
I have developed. But [[I **don't believe there is any**]{.mark}
**fundamental scientific [limitation]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} achieving the
goal of these machines being able to **[discriminate better]{.mark} than
humans can** in the fog of war]{.underline}, again in tightly specified
situations. This is the benchmark that I use, rather than perfection.
But if [that]{.underline} standard is achieved, it [can **succeed** in
reducing noncombatant casualties]{.underline} and thus is a goal worth
pursuing in my estimation.

One way to [think about this]{.underline} is [like autonomous cars.
Expecting an autonomous car to keep you safe 100 percent of the time is
**unrealistic**. But, if an autonomous car is]{.underline} (say) [**5
percent more likely** to keep you safe than if you were driving
yourself, you'd still be **much better off** letting it take over.
Autonomous cars]{.underline}, by the way, [will likely be **much safer**
than that, and]{.underline} it's entirely possible that [**autonomous
armed robots will be**, **too**]{.underline}. And if autonomous armed
robots really do have at least the potential reduce casualties, aren't
we then ethically obligated to develop them?

[If there are **any doubts** about how effective or ethical [these
systems]{.mark} might be, just **[test]{.mark} them
[exhaustively]{.mark}**. **Deploy them**, **load them up with blanks**,
[and **watch**]{.mark} **how they do**]{.underline}. Will they screw up
sometimes? Of course they will, both during testing and after. But
setting aside the point above about relative effectiveness, [[the **big
advantage**]{.mark} of robots is that their behavior [is **traceable**
and]{.mark} they **learn [programmatic]{.mark}ally**: if one robot does
something wrong, [it's possible to **trace the**]{.mark} **chain of
[decisions]{.mark}** that it made]{.underline} (decisions programmed
into it by a human, by the way) [to find out what happened. Once the
error is located, it can be **resolved**, and you can be **confident**
that [the robot **will not make that**]{.mark} **same [mistake]{.mark}
again**. Furthermore, [you can **update every**]{.mark} **other [robot
at the same time]{.mark}**. This is **not something we can do with
humans**]{.underline}.

I do agree that [there is a potential risk with autonomous weapons of
making it **easier to decide to use force**. But, that's been true
**ever since someone realized that they could throw a rock at someone
else** instead of **walking up** and **punching them**. There's been
**continual development** of technologies that allow us to engage our
enemies while minimizing our own risk]{.underline}, and what with the
ballistic and cruise missiles that we've had for the last half century,
we've got that pretty well figured out. [If you want to argue that
autonomous drones or armed ground robots will lower the bar even
farther, then okay, but [it's a]{.mark} **pretty [low bar]{.mark}** [as
is]{.mark}. And]{.underline} fundamentally, [you're then placing the
blame on **technology**, **not the people**]{.underline} deciding how to
use the technology.

And that's the point that I keep coming back to on this: [[blaming
tech]{.mark}nology for the decisions that we make involving it
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} at best
**[[counterproductive]{.underline}]{.mark}** and at worst nonsensical.
[**[Any tech]{.mark}nology** [can be used for evil]{.mark}, and many
technologies that were [developed to kill people]{.mark} are [now
responsible for]{.mark} **some of [our greatest
achievements]{.mark}**]{.underline}, from harnessing nuclear power to
riding a ballistic missile into space. If you want to make the argument
that this is really about the decision to use the technology, not the
technology itself, then that's awesome. I'm totally with you. But
[banning the technology is **not going to solve the problem** if [the
problem is the **willingness of humans** to use]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nology [for evil]{.mark}]{.underline}: we'd need a much
bigger petition for that.

#### [Increasing informatization of war net reduces violence]{.underline}\-\--alternative's worse

Thomas **Rid 13**, THOMAS RID is a Reader in War Studies at King's
College London, 12-1-2013, \"Cyberwar and Peace,\" Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2013-10-15/cyberwar-and-peace

Cyberwar Is Coming!" declared the title of a seminal 1993 article by the
RAND Corporation analysts John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, who argued
that the nascent Internet would fundamentally transform warfare. The
idea seemed fanciful at the time, and it took more than a decade for
members of the U.S. national security establishment to catch on. But
once they did, a chorus of voices resounded in the mass media,
proclaiming the dawn of the era of cyberwar and warning of its
terrifying potential. In February 2011, then CIA Director [Leon Panetta
warned]{.underline} Congress that "[the **next Pearl Harbor could very
well be a cyberattack**]{.underline}." And in late 2012, Mike
[McConnell]{.underline}, who had served as director of national
intelligence under President George W. Bush, [warned]{.underline} darkly
[that the United States could not "wait for the cyber equivalent of the
collapse of the World Trade Centers]{.underline}." [Yet the
**[hype]{.mark}**]{.underline} about everything "cyber" [has
[obscured]{.mark}]{.underline} three [**[basic truths:]{.underline}**
[cyberwar has **never happened**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the past, [it
is **not occurring**]{.underline} in the present, [and it is **highly
unlikely**]{.underline} [that it will disturb the future]{.underline}.
Indeed, rather than heralding a new era of violent conflict, [[so
far]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark}-era [has been defined by]{.mark} **the
opposite trend: [a computer-enabled assault on]{.mark} political
[violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[diminish]{.underline}]{.mark}** rather than accentuate **[political
[violence]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[by making it easier]{.mark} for
states, groups, and individuals [to **engage in**]{.mark} **two kinds of
[aggression that do not rise to]{.mark} the level of [war]{.mark}:
sabotage and espionage**]{.underline}. [Weaponized computer code and
computer-based sabotage operations make it possible to carry out highly
targeted attacks on an adversary's technical systems **without directly
and physically harming human operators and managers**]{.underline}.
Computer-assisted attacks make it possible to steal data without placing
operatives in dangerous environments, [[thus **reducing**]{.mark} **the
level of**]{.underline} personal and political
**[[risk]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These developments represent important
changes in the nature of political violence, but they also highlight
[limitations inherent in cyberweapons]{.underline} that **[greatly
curtail the utility of cyberattacks]{.underline}**. Those limitations
seem to make it difficult to use cyberweapons for anything other than
one-off, hard-to-repeat sabotage operations of questionable strategic
value that might even prove counterproductive. And cyber-espionage often
requires improving traditional spycraft techniques and relying even more
heavily on human intelligence. Taken together, these factors call into
question the very idea that computer-assisted attacks will usher in a
profoundly new era. THE THIN CASE FOR CYBERWAR One reason discussions
about cyberwar have become disconnected from reality is that many
commentators fail to grapple with a basic question: What counts as
warfare? Carl von Clausewitz, the nineteenth-century Prussian military
theorist, still offers the most concise answer to that question.
Clausewitz identified three main criteria that any aggressive or
defensive action must meet in order to qualify as an act of war. First,
and most simply, all acts of war are violent or potentially violent.
Second, an act of war is always instrumental: physical violence or the
threat of force is a means to compel the enemy to accept the attacker's
will. Finally, to qualify as an act of war, an attack must have some
kind of political goal or intention. For that reason, acts of war must
be attributable to one side at some point during a confrontation. No
known cyberattack has met all three of those criteria; indeed, very few
have met even one. Consider three incidents that today's Cassandras
frequently point to as evidence that warfare has entered a new era. The
first of these, a massive pipeline explosion in the Soviet Union in June
1982, would count as the most violent cyberattack to date \-- if it
actually happened. According to a 2004 book by Thomas Reed, who was
serving as a staffer on the U.S. National Security Council at the time
of the alleged incident, a covert U.S. operation used rigged software to
engineer a massive explosion in the Urengoy-Surgut-Chelyabinsk pipeline,
which connected Siberian natural gas fields to Europe. Reed claims that
the CIA managed to insert malicious code into the software that
controlled the pipeline's pumps and valves. The rigged valves supposedly
resulted in an explosion that, according to Reed, the U.S. Air Force
rated at three kilotons, equivalent to the force of a small nuclear
device. But aside from Reed's account, there is hardly any evidence to
prove that any such thing happened, and plenty of reasons to doubt that
it did. After Reed published his book, Vasily Pchelintsev, who was
reportedly the KGB head of the region when the explosion was supposed to
have taken place, denied the story. He surmised that Reed might have
been referring to a harmless explosion that happened not in June but on
a warm April day that year, caused by pipes shifting in the thawing
ground of the tundra. Moreover, no Soviet media reports from 1982
confirm that Reed's explosion took place, although the Soviet media
regularly reported on accidents and pipeline explosions at the time.
What's more, given the technologies available to the United States at
that time, it would have been very difficult to hide malicious software
of the kind Reed describes from its Soviet users. Another incident often
related by promoters of the concept of cyberwar occurred in Estonia in
2007. After Estonian authorities decided to move a Soviet-era memorial
to Russian soldiers who died in World War II from the center of Tallinn
to the city's outskirts, outraged Russian-speaking Estonians launched
violent riots that threatened to paralyze the city. The riots were
accompanied by cyber-assaults, which began as crude disruptions but
became more sophisticated after a few days, culminating in a "denial of
service" attack. Hackers hijacked up to 85,000 computers and used them
to overwhelm 58 Estonian websites, including that of the country's
largest bank, which the attacks rendered useless for a few hours.
Estonia's defense minister and the country's top diplomat pointed their
fingers at the Kremlin, but they were unable to muster any evidence. For
its part, the Russian government denied any involvement. In the wake of
the incident, Estonia's prime minister, Andrus Ansip, likened the attack
to an act of war. "What's the difference between a blockade of harbors
or airports of sovereign states and the blockade of government
institutions and newspaper websites?" he asked. It was a rhetorical
question, but the answer is important: unlike a naval blockade, the
disruption of websites is not violent \-- indeed, not even potentially
violent. The choice of targets also seemed unconnected to the presumed
tactical objective of forcing the government to reverse its decision on
the memorial. And unlike a naval blockade, the attacks remained
anonymous, without political backing, and thus unattributable. A year
later, a third major event entered the cyber-Cassandras' repertoire. In
August 2008, the Georgian army attacked separatists in the province of
South Ossetia. Russia backed the separatists and responded militarily.
The prior month, in what might have been the first time that an
independent cyberattack was launched in coordination with a conventional
military operation, unknown attackers had begun a campaign of
cyber-sabotage, defacing prominent Georgian websites, including those of
the country's national bank and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and
launching denial-of-service attacks against the websites of Georgia's
parliament, its largest commercial bank, and Georgian news outlets. The
Georgian government blamed the Kremlin, just as the Estonians had done.
But Russia again denied sponsoring the attacks, and a NATO investigation
later found "no conclusive proof" of who had carried them out. The
attack set off increasingly familiar alarm bells within American media
and the U.S. national security establishment. "The July attack may have
been a dress rehearsal for an all-out cyberwar," an article in The New
York Times declared. Richard Clarke, a former White House cybersecurity
czar, warned that the worst was yet to come: the Georgian attack did not
"begin to reveal what the Russian military and intelligence agencies
could do if they were truly on the attack in cyberspace." Yet the actual
effects of these nonviolent events were quite mild. The main damage they
caused was to the Georgian government's ability to communicate
internationally, thus preventing it from getting out its message at a
critical moment. But even if the attackers intended this effect, it
proved short-lived: within four days after military confrontations had
begun in earnest, the Georgian Foreign Ministry had set up an account on
Google's blog-hosting service. This move helped the government keep open
a channel to the public and the news media. What the Internet took away,
the Internet returned. ISTOCK.COM / -ANTONIO- Overblown: keyboard as
grenade. IN CODE WE TRUST? Perhaps the strongest evidence presented by
advocates of the concept of cyberwar is the Stuxnet operation launched
against Iran by the United States and Israel. Stuxnet, part of a set of
attacks known as Operation Olympic Games, was a sophisticated multiyear
campaign to sabotage Iran's nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz by
inserting a harmful computer worm into the software that ran the
facility's centrifuges, causing them to overload. American and Israeli
developers started designing the project as early as 2005, and it
launched in 2007, growing more sophisticated until its discovery in
2010. The attack was groundbreaking in several ways. The developers
built highly target-specific intelligence into the code, enabling the
Stuxnet software to make autonomous decisions in its target environment.
Most important, Stuxnet represented the first and only physically
destructive cyberattack launched by one state (or, in this case, two
states) against another. Yet even [cyberattacks that cause damage do so
only **indirectly**]{.underline}. As an agent of violence, [[computer
code]{.mark} faces a very basic limit: it **[does not have its own
force]{.mark} or energy**]{.underline}. Instead, [any cyberattack with
the goal of material destruction or harming human life must utilize the
force or energy **embedded in its target**]{.underline}: for example,
shutting down an air traffic control system and causing trains or planes
to crash or disrupting a power plant and sparking an explosion. Yet
besides Stuxnet, [there is no proof that **anyone has ever successfully
launched a major attack of this sort**]{.underline}. [[Lethal
cyberattacks]{.mark}, while certainly possible, [remain]{.mark} the
**stuff of [fiction]{.mark}**]{.underline}: none has ever killed or even
injured a single human being. [Thanks to its lack of direct physical
impact, code-induced violence also has **less emotional
impact**]{.underline}. [It would be difficult for a cyberattack to
produce]{.underline} the level of **[fear]{.underline}** [that
coordinated]{.underline} campaigns of [terrorism]{.underline} or
conventional military operations [produce]{.underline}. Owing to their
invisibility, [[cyberweapons also lack]{.mark} the **[symbolic
power]{.mark}** of traditional ones]{.underline}. Displays of weaponry,
such as the elaborate military parades put on by China and North Korea,
sometimes represent nothing more than nationalist pageantry. But
revealing one's arsenal can also serve tactical and strategic ends, as
when countries deploy aircraft carriers to demonstrate their readiness
to use force or carry out operations designed to intimidate the enemy,
such as using military aircraft to conduct deliberately low flyovers.
Indeed, displaying weapons systems and threatening to use them can prove
more cost-efficient than their actual use. But cyberweapons are hard to
brandish. Perhaps the most crucial limitation of violence in cyberspace
is its almost entirely destructive quality: unlike traditional political
violence, which can maintain trust in institutions and states as well as
undermine it, violence in cyberspace can do only the latter. Any
established political order comes with a certain degree of inherent
violence; consolidated states, after all, survive only if they maintain
monopolies on the legitimate use of force. By encouraging trust in the
ability of state institutions to protect property and safeguard
citizens, this inherent violence buttresses a state's power and allows
the state to establish the rule of law. But cyber-violence lacks this
ability, since it does little or nothing to build up trust in
institutions; indeed, it is very difficult to imagine how cyberattacks
could be used to enforce rules or laws, either domestically or
internationally. Digital surveillance presents a more complicated
picture. In democracies, intelligence agencies tread a thin line between
providing security and eroding public trust in the state, as
demonstrated by the recent controversy over the U.S. National Security
Agency's data-collection practices. In authoritarian countries, digital
surveillance can assist the state's coercive use of force, but it cannot
replace it. Such limitations, however, should not lead anyone to dismiss
the corrosive potential of cyberattacks. Indeed, such assaults can
undermine social trust in a more direct way than traditional political
violence. Cyberattacks are more precise; they do not necessarily
undermine the state's monopoly of force in a wholesale fashion. Instead,
they can be tailored to attack specific companies or public-sector
organizations and used to undermine those groups' authority selectively.
Stuxnet provides a good example of this dynamic. Putting aside the
question of whether the attack was an act of war, its primary intention
was to undermine the trust of the Iranian scientists in their systems
and in themselves and the trust of the Iranian regime in its ability to
build nuclear weapons. The original intention was to cause physical
damage to as many Iranian centrifuges as possible. But the American and
Israeli attackers knew that the physical effect could be exploited to
unleash a much more damaging psychological effect. "The intent was that
the failures should make them feel they were stupid, which is what
happened," an American participant told The New York Times. The
Americans and the Israelis hoped that once a few machines failed, the
Iranian engineers would shut down more machines because they distrusted
their own technology or indeed their own skills. At the headquarters of
the International Atomic Energy Agency, in Vienna, rumors circulated
that the Iranians had lost so much confidence in their own systems and
instruments that the management of the Natanz facility took the
extraordinary step of assigning engineers to sit in the plant and radio
back what they saw to confirm the instrument readings. "They
overreacted," one of the attackers revealed to David Sanger of The New
York Times, "and that delayed them even more." The Iranians also began
to assign blame internally, pointing fingers at one another and even
firing some personnel. DIGITAL UNDERGROUND Damaging though it may have
been, Stuxnet, along with the cyber-scuffles in Estonia and Georgia,
represents not a new form of warfare but something more akin to other,
less lethal forms of aggression: sabotage and espionage. Unlike acts of
war, these political crimes, which are often committed by nonstate
actors, need not be violent to work. And although saboteurs and spies do
act politically, they often seek to avoid attribution, unlike those who
launch acts of war. For those reasons, the cyber-era has been a boon for
political crime. Consider sabotage. Before the computer age, saboteurs
had trouble calibrating and controlling the effects of their actions.
Sabotage had to target physical property and relied on physical
violence, which often proves unpredictable. During postal and railway
strikes in France in 1909 and 1910, for instance, saboteurs cut signal
wires and tore down telegraph posts. Destroying property risked running
afoul of public opinion, and the tactic ultimately divided the workers.
The strikes themselves, as a form of sabotage, also ran the risk of
leading to unpredictable violence: indeed, labor demonstrations often
intensified into riots, making it easier for opponents to portray the
strikers as uncompromising radicals. It is much easier for saboteurs to
avoid counterproductive side effects in the age of computer-assisted
attacks, which can contain violence and generally avoid it altogether.
Cyberattacks can maliciously affect software and business processes
without interfering with physical industrial processes, remaining
nonviolent but sometimes still causing greater damage than a traditional
assault. A 2012 attack against the computer network of the oil company
Saudi Aramco illustrates this potential. The attack physically harmed
neither hardware nor humans. Yet by allegedly erasing the hard disks of
some 30,000 computers, the attackers likely did much more monetary
damage to Saudi Aramco than they could have through an act of
traditional sabotage against machinery in one of the company's plants.
The oil giant reportedly had to hire six specialized computer security
firms to help with its forensic investigation and post-attack cleanup.
Despite such potential, it is also important to remember the inherent
limitations of computer-assisted political crime and to note that human
agents remain critical in the age of digital violence. Even Stuxnet, the
most successful example of cyber-sabotage, demonstrates this fact. For
the United States and Israel, the "holy grail," in the words of one of
the attack's architects, was getting a piece of malicious software into
the control system at Natanz. The Americans and Israelis needed
fine-grained data from inside the Iranian plant to develop their
weaponized code. The problem was that the control system was protected
by an air gap: it was not connected to the Internet or even internal
networks. As a result, the attackers had to deliver the malicious code
via a removable hard drive such as a USB flash drive \-- delivered by a
human hand. To make this happen, U.S. intelligence operatives first
obtained a list of the people who were visiting the targeted plant to
work on its computer equipment and who could carry the payload there.
"We had to find an unwitting person on the Iranian side of the house who
could jump the gap," one planner later told Sanger. The list of possible
carriers included engineers from the German company Siemens, who were
helping their Iranian colleagues maintain the control system \-- work
that required the Siemens engineers to bring portable computers into the
plant. Precisely how the U.S.-Israeli team managed to exploit this
vulnerability remains unknown. Suffice it to say that although "Siemens
had no idea they were a carrier," in the words of one U.S. official
quoted by Sanger, "it turns out there is always an idiot around who
doesn't think much about the thumb drive in their hand." SAFETY IN ONES

3.4 [The **Failure of Cyber Deterrence?** The potency of cyber
deterrence is difficult to judge]{.underline}. This is partly [because
there exists no consensus on what constitutes an act of
sufficient]{.underline} cyber [aggression]{.underline}. Therefore, it is
not entirely clear what is to be deterred. Where exactly the threshold
for response should be will be discussed in section three of this paper.
[For now]{.underline}, we can state that **[low-level [nuisance
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[are]{.mark} a **[daily]{.mark}
occurrence**]{.underline}. For example, U.S. military networks are
probed and scanned millions of times each day (Work 2015, 1). Similarly,
[acts of cyber espionage are reasonably common]{.underline}.
[[However]{.mark}, what is also [evident is the **lack of
major**]{.mark} **cyber [attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [For a while,
Stuxnet, Wiper, Shamoon and Bronze Soldier appeared to signal the rise
of cyber attack as a potent new instrument of policy. However, **medium
to [large]{.mark}-scale [attacks]{.mark} have essentially
[dried-up]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Indeed, reflecting the empirical
evidence, and marking a shift in tone, in his]{.underline} September
[2015 testimony]{.underline} to the Senate Armed Services Committee,
Director of National Intelligence, James [[Clapper]{.underline},
**[talked down]{.underline}**]{.mark} the possibility of **[[an
'electronic Pearl Harbor']{.underline}]{.mark}**. Instead, he focused on
ongoing 'low-to-moderate' level threats (Clapper 2015, 2). What does
this all tell us? **[Is deterrence working?]{.underline}** If one
considers low-to-moderate threats as deterrable, then the answer would
seem to be no. From this perspective, and according to some policy
makers, deterrence is already failing. In a 2015 Senate Armed Services
Committee Hearing, Chairman John McCain was scathing in his assessment:
'Our adversaries view our response \... as timid and ineffectual. Put
simply, the problem is a lack of deterrence. The administration has not
demonstrated to our adversaries that the consequence of continued cyber
attacks against us outweigh the benefit.' (Takala 2015) However, [if we
take the view that cyber [deterrence should]{.mark}]{.underline} really
[[concern itself only with **large**]{.mark}**-scale
[attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the picture is]{.underline} more
**[positive]{.underline}**. Indeed, [Valeriano and
[Maness]{.mark}]{.underline} (2015) have
[[identified]{.underline}]{.mark} **[considerable]{.underline}** levels
of [**[restraint]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}]{.mark} [state [cyber
behaviour]{.mark}]{.underline}. This could be [[due to]{.mark} a **[lack
of confidence in the]{.mark} strategic [utility of]{.mark} cyber
[attack]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[It may also reflect]{.mark} the
development of **[norms]{.mark}**]{.underline} [against
aggressive]{.underline} forms of [cyber behaviour [and]{.mark} the
efficacy of **[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed,
[norms]{.underline} increasingly [form part of '**complex deterrence'**,
within which military and non-military elements operate
together]{.underline}. In cyberspace, although a settled understanding
of universal rules of behaviour is still lacking, [[norms]{.mark} appear
to be [crystalis]{.mark}ing [around **acceptable**]{.mark}]{.underline}
forms of [**[intrusion]{.underline}** [rather than]{.underline}]{.mark}
[a **blanket [non-use]{.mark} position**]{.underline} (Stevens 2012,
25). [[This]{.mark} may [explain]{.mark} the continuance of [lowlevel
probes]{.mark} whilst large attacks have trailed off.]{.underline}

Boboi Rahedi, Student Conversations about Professional Responsibilities
of the Engineer @ The University of Sheffield, "THE ETHICS OF ADVANCED
WEAPONRY: SHOULD WE EXPECT BAE SYSTEMS TO CARE?",
https://prestudentconversation.wordpress.com/2017/04/07/group-2/

BAE Systems engages in sales of advanced weaponry to the United
Kingdom's allies globally, directly contributing to the 7,665 airstrikes
that have hit Syria in the last two years. [Is it ethically
accountable]{.underline} for the UK [to be a leading power in creating
advanced weaponry when it gives rise to unfavorable impacts on human
life? Or are the net benefits of weapons as deterrents and economic
stimuli a force for good?]{.underline} This article aims to create
discussion around BAE Systems' role as a weapons manufacturer and its
impact around the world. **[Weapons as deterrents]{.underline}** "There
is, in the world in which we all live, the principle of speaking softly
but carrying a big stick -- and that very often encourages people to
negotiate" argued Sir Roger Carr at the recent BAE Systems annual
general meeting -- "[we try and provide our people, our government, our
allies with the very best weapons, the very best sticks they can have,
to encourage peace]{.underline}." Applying ethics of care principles to
the business of warmongering is useless in the realm of engineering,
rather, [one must take a pragmatic view of the ethical
cycle]{.underline}. The question of whether BAE Systems conducts its
advanced weaponry business ethically is grounded by the principle that
conflict will always exist; as such, it is human nature for distrust to
fester. Hence, a case can be made that [[to cease the supply of advanced
weaponry]{.mark} to responsible nations [would]{.mark} in fact not
[be]{.mark} principled martyrdom, but **[ethical
suicide.]{.mark}**]{.underline} As Carr points out, [[advanced weaponry
can]{.mark} often [prove a very **effective deterrent to
conflict**]{.mark} in the first place -- but furthermore, as an
influential western arms dealer, BAE Systems also has the opportunity to
**minimize collateral damage in war zones**.]{.underline} [The supply of
advanced weaponry with high levels of precision allows for targeted
airstrikes that eliminate the specific threat to life posed by the
target, with a **minimal loss of civilian life**]{.underline}. Now
contrast this with the alternative of withdrawing supply. Undoubtedly,
**[[unprincipled arms distributors would step into cover the gap in the
market, supplying less precise weaponry]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The most
recent major example of aging, unguided weaponry being supplied to a war
zone is Russian support of President Assad's disputed and morally
reprehensible regime in Syria -- which has since caused a humanitarian
crisis in Aleppo. [[Permitting the growth of such regressive means of
conflict (potentially including]{.mark} the rise of [chemical weaponry)
is the alternative]{.mark} to BAE supplying advanced weaponry, and [so
abandoning western influence]{.mark} on the global arms market can only
lead one way -- to a **greater disregard for international humanitarian
law**.]{.underline} In any case, **[this [cannot be considered a morally
acceptable action]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- and so by default, if
nothing else, the alternative of BAE Systems supplying sophisticated
weaponry must be considered ethical. Such rationality illustrates why
ethics of care fails to provide an acceptable moral solution in this
case. Utilitarianism and regulation of the arms market [From a
utilitarian viewpoint, the sustainment of powerful weaponry enables a
country to defend its people and provide assistance in foreign conflicts
where there is a suffering population. Doing so arguably **protects a
majority of people.**]{.underline} Furthermore, with the FTSE 100 index
about to suffer from Brexit uncertainty, the nation's industrial future
is at risk. BAE System's economic contribution is critical for jobs in
turbulent times. The UK defence industry employs 300,000 people,
supplies 10 per cent of the country's manufacturing and engineering
jobs, and has a turnover of £35bn through 9,000 different companies. BAE
Systems has a pivotal role in ensuring the UK economy's prosperous
future by being the real driver of the next skills generation: promoting
STEM subject pathways, through which graduates get into engineering.
Additionally, as a result of the profits from the manufacture and sale
of arms, BAE Systems provides a backbone of technical support to other
market sectors -- for example building solutions for other industries
such as transport; including the digital transformation of the UK rail
network. There are a number of key international weapons regulations,
whereby some governments have very robust arms trade control systems in
place, but [other governments are fuelling the illicit and irresponsible
trade in arms by having weak control systems or none at
all]{.underline}. BAE [Systems ensures risks like this are minimised by
implementing an Arms Trade Treaty that reduces and prevents excessive
conflict, via making it difficult for armed groups that commit human
rights abuses to acquire a ready flow of arms.]{.underline} The treaty
provides an important framework for well-regulated defence trade and the
reduction of illegal arms sales around the world. Money should be
invested in diplomacy instead of fuelling war and destruction. BAE
Systems deals with numerous countries which do not rank favorably on the
human freedom index. The sale of advanced weaponry demonstrates, solely,
an archaic form of diplomacy which is not apt for the modern world,
where conflict is rife and human life is priceless. **[Arms do not have
to be the prime medium through which diplomacy is
navigated.]{.underline}** The UK should explore other avenues; China for
all its prowess utilizes Pandas as a bargaining tool to advance their
agenda with other world powers. Joseph Nye, named this "Soft Power". [By
using civilian instruments of national security such as strategic
communications, foreign assistance, civic action and economic
reconstruction -- relationships are built on the exchange of culture and
knowledge as opposed to exploiting their perceived
insecurity.]{.underline} BAE Systems could incorporate promotion of this
moral intellectualism into their budget, where **[[exchange of
intelligence and civic action lead to stronger mutual relationships
developing without the transfer of arms]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Destruction created by the weaponry not only physically affects those
that are targeted but also creates a long-term drop in quality of life
for citizens. Millions of civilians have fled Syria due to the
destruction of their homes and lack of basic amenities. Around two
million people struggle to find clean water in Aleppo, as airstrikes
have been targeted the water infrastructure of the city and this has cut
civilian access to clean drinking water. Furthermore, refugee camps such
as those in Za'atari camp in Jordan contain only temporary solutions for
progressively longer-term issues such as maternity centres and wash
blocks. This is the environment the next generation are being born into
and are therefore starting life with an inherent ~~handicap~~. BAE
Systems could adopt an ethics of care framework which would allow them
to reconsider and understand the severity of the consequences of their
actions; principally selling such weapons. [[There is no foolproof way
of determining the end user of advanced weaponry]{.mark}, or of usage
intentions -- but by not producing such weaponry, BAE Systems could
avoid any risk of misuse.]{.underline}

Taking a cue from Simpson and Tuck and Yang, I turn to Tuck's 2010
critique of Deleuze's notion of "desire" as an example of the
theoretical practice of refusal, which Simpson wonders about and which
Tuck and Yang elaborated on in 2014. Eve [Tuck]{.underline}'s 2010
article "Breaking Up with Deleuze" [refuses Deleuze's understanding and
imposition of his definition of desire for Native studies and Native
resurgence in particular]{.underline}. [Tuck refuses the
Deleuzoguattarian nomadic due to its totalizing moves and specifically
its evasion and refusal of Native and alternative notions of refusal
that emerge from Native struggles for survival]{.underline}.24 For Tuck,
[paying attention to "the continuity of ancestors," or genealogies, in
Native and in all modes of knowledge production is
imperative.]{.underline} For Indigenous and Native studies, [it reverses
the erasure enacted by continental European and settler- colonial
theory, which uses a tradition of ongoing genocide to annihilate Native
thinkers and subsequently their epistemologies and
theories.]{.underline} Prior to Byrd's indictment of Deleuzoguattarian
laudatory accounts of America's terrain of "Indians without Ancestry,"
Tuck reroutes us back to ancestral and genealogical thinking as a way of
asserting Indigenous presence and its epistemological systems and
traditions, devoid of Cartesian boundary- making impulses and desires.
Tuck's work also prepares us in 2010 for the critique that Byrd levies
in 2011, which exposes the traditions, roots, and genealogies of
**[Western poststructuralist theory]{.underline}**. Such theory [created
the conditions of possibility and emergence for **Deleuzoguattarian
genocidal forms** of **rhizomatic and nonrepresentational**
thought.]{.underline} Black Caribbean feminist Michelle V. Rowley argues
we need to especially attend to a theory's "politics and conditions of
emergence."25 In other words, we need to consider on whose backs or
through whose blood a theory developed and then circulated while hiding
its own violence. Jodi Byrd in particular attends to the colonialist,
genocidal, and therefore humanist impulses of the rhizome in her book
Transit of Empire.26 What is particularly instructive is the way that
Byrd operationalizes her critique of Deleuze and Guattari's first
chapter, "Rhizome," in their tome A Thousand Plateaus.27 [Byrd's
deconstruction, or picking apart, of the poststructuralist and
nonsubject- and nonobject- related Deleuzoguattarian rhizomatics are a
masterfu]{.underline}l (and frankly thuggish and rude) [demonstration of
refusing to adapt or "repair" colonial epistemologies and
geographies]{.underline}. [Byrd's refusal is a moment that further helps
one distinguish between the works of postcolonial and decolonial
studies]{.underline}. [Byrd performs an outright refusal that short
circuits the colonial and postcolonial comportments of politesse, which
allow genocidal Western thought to continue uninterrupted]{.underline}.
Byrd's [interrogation of the "colonial nostalgia" latent in
poststructural and nonrepresentational forms of thought like Deleuze and
Guattari's rhizome is an explicit example of how the violence of white
nonrepresentational theory creates an immediate space of impasse for
Indigenous, decolonial, Black, and abolitionist intellectual
traditions]{.underline}. As Byrd argues[, the **Deleuzian and Guattarian
rhizome** assumes its **errant**, **untraceable**, and
**de/reterritorializing path** through **Native genocide**]{.underline}.
[The rhizome obtains its **metaphorical and theoretical elasticity**
from the **discursive genocide of Indigenous peoples**. The territory of
maneuver or ground that the rhizome gains its bearing on is unwittingly
or perhaps indifferently **anchored in the disavowal** of the
**Indigenous ancestral claims**, **history**, **presence**, and
**ongoing relationship** with the land in North America. Deleuze and
Guattari covet the **free- range and bloody movements** in the West,
described as a land of "Indians without Ancestry" primarily because they
do not have to contend with the presence of Indigenous peoples and their
prior relationships (ancestors) to the land and space through which they
move and clear as nomads]{.underline}. There are no existing people to
which [Deleuze and Guattari]{.underline} have to be accountable.
Therefore, their own and others' [self- actualizing, free- form
whiteness can proceed unimpeded]{.underline}. **[The rhizomatic
West]{.underline}**--- **[terra nullius]{.underline}**--- [is without a
people, history, or a cosmology to navigate.]{.underline} Byrd's reading
of Deleuze and Guattari's reproduction or transit of the "Indian" in
their book A Thousand Plateaus limns some of the methods in which
[**colonialism and modes of conquest** are enacted on behalf of the
**self-actualization of white subjects** who produce nonrepresentational
theory.]{.underline} In fact, Byrd argues that [the "Indian is the
**ontological prior through which poststructuralism
functions."**]{.underline}28 Byrd traces [the appearance or deployment
of the Indian as a simulation or "present absent" in Jacques Derrida's
and then Deleuze and Guattari's work,]{.underline} which [creates
**space for the white subject and the unending frontier**.]{.underline}
Byrd also argues that [nonrepresentational theory **heralded as a
liberatory path beyond the subject** is **colonialist**]{.underline}.
Byr[d indicts Deleuze and Guattari's use of]{.underline} Leslie
Fiedler's work in order to invoke [the American West and the Indian as
exceptional cases that inspire rhizomatic movement through the notion of
an ever- receding frontier]{.underline}.29 [It is
colonialist]{.underline} on (at least) two accounts[: in its need to
render the Indian **already and inevitably (ontologically) dead** as
"it" has no ancestors or living community to whom one needs to be
accountable; and in its **invocation of the vanishing "Indian**," which
opens up the possibility **of an "ever- receding frontier**" and
inspiration for the metaphor of the rhizome]{.underline}. [**This logic
and mode of conquistador thought undergirds the Deleuzian and Guattarian
ethos of experimental and rhizomatic lines of flight**. Their
nonrepresentational theory of lines of flight are only possible as a
form of **white self-actualizing posthumanism** due to the **death of
Indigenous peoples** and their **excision from the
Earth/land**]{.underline}. **[White posthumanism and its flows and lines
of flight are made possible through Native death.]{.underline}**

#### Lines of flight are colonial imaginings that require a structural opposition to indigeneity, giving geospatial birth to the 'line' itself

If Byrd's refusal is a first- order engagement and argument, then Linda
Tuhiwai Smith's [interrogation of the spatial vocabularies of the human
and colonialism is a]{.underline} second- order analysis and [practice
of refusal]{.underline}, one that reroutes us and makes us ask new
questions. As Smith has argued in her classic work Decolonizing
Methodologies, "[there is a very specific spatial vocabulary of
colonialism which can be assembled around three concepts: (1) the line,
(2) the centre, and (3) the outside.]{.underline}"33 [The **Deleuzian
and Guattarian line of flight** then also emerges from the **colonial
spatial imaginings of the colonizer**.]{.underline} [Within Western
ideas and philosophical conceptions of temporality and spatiality, like
Deleuze and Guattari's line, time and space have been categorized and
imagined as entities that can be measured]{.underline}. In Smith's
account, "Space came to be seen as consisting of lines which were either
parallel or elliptical."34 [Rather than escaping the reterritorializing
capture of colonial and state power, **Deleuzian and Guattarian "lines
of flight**" coalesce with the **line's emergence as a way to map
"territory**, to **[survey land]{.mark}**, to **establish boundaries**,
and **mark the limits of colonial power**]{.underline}."35 While not
intended to mark boundaries or colonize [Deleuze and Guattari's use of
the line of flight, **rhizomatic and violent movements** to **produce a
land of Indigenous peoples without ancestors** continues rather than
ruptures **colonial violence**]{.underline}.36 [As Deleuze and Guattari
attempt to move away from an "I" or "a subject," through the use of
nonrepresentational and nomadic "lines of flight," they successfully
resurrect the human through the geo- epistemology of the
"line."]{.underline} Within humanist cognitive frames, lines emerge in
response to chaos. The line, which seeks to separate "order" from
"chaos," falls into formation with what Sylvia Wynter identifies as "the
structural oppositions" that order humanist thought.37 Even [the "line
of flight" establishes a **linear/nonlinear structural opposition** that
**demarcates the "order**" of the **invisible white "self** " in
**opposition to the "chaotic" realm of the dead Indigenous and Black
"nonbeing**." The line in all of its Deleuzian and Guattarian "molar,
molecular, and nomadic" iterations is a **humanist geospatial and
epistemic configuration**. The **molar lines that make smooth space** do
so through the **clearing of Indigenous peoples** (clear to smooth) in
order to **produce a colonial grid of order**]{.underline}. Deleuze and
Guattari even fret over the potential susceptibility of the molecular (a
more supple and ambiguous line not so prone to segmentation and
rigidity) and the liberatory line of flight to become susceptible to the
pull of the state. In A Thousand Plateaus, one can sense the anxiety
they have about the molecular and nomadic line of flight. There is one
last problem, the most anguishing one, concerning the dangers specific
to each line. There is not much to say about the danger confronting the
first \[molar line\], for the chances are slim that its rigidification
will fail. There is not much to say about the ambiguity of the second
\[molecular line\]. But why is the line of flight, even aside from the
danger it runs of reverting to one of the other two lines, imbued with
such singular despair in spite of its message of joy, as if at the very
moment things are coming to a resolution its undertaking were threatened
by something reaching down to its core, by a death, a demolition?38 The
"something" that is reaching down and can be found in its core are the
very traces of the human. [Humanist secular thought that emerged from
the fifteenth- century conquest and enslavement of Native and Black
peoples produced the geometry of the line. The line is a way or an
episteme used by the human to distinguish self from the other and
produce the very structural oppositions]{.underline} that Sylvia Wynter
names as [essential to the human and its various genres.]{.underline}
Smith's [deconstruction of the geo- epistemologies of "the center, the
line," and the "outside" poses questions and prods Western critical
theory in ways that Western theory has yet to do itself, particularly
about its subjectless and more specifically nonrepresentational
moves.]{.underline} In addition to Wynter's structural oppositions, it
is also productive to think about how Wynter's "beyond" has us contend
with the underlying epistemes that make the human possible. Zakiyyah
Iman Jackson's engagement with Wynter's "beyond" also interrogates the
call to transcend the human. In a recent GLQ roundtable discussion
titled "Queer Inhumanisms," Jackson asks what it means when Black life
is asked to make this transcendent move.39 Finally, I more carefully
consider the work of Amber Jamilla Musser, who makes room for Deleuze
and Guattari's influence while being skeptical of and drawing attention
to the specific ways that [affect, sensation, and other
nonrepresentational theories end up hailing and producing subjects even
as they try and avoid systems of representation.]{.underline} GETTING ON
AND BEYOND Throughout Sylvia Wynter's body of work, particularly the
portion that Greg Thomas calls the "beyond" work,40 Wynter attends to
the epistemic, aesthetic, performative, and moral technologies such as
structural oppositions, which are needed in order to write the human as
an exclusive mode of being. Sylvia Wynter is concerned with getting rid
of the epistemic systems and orders of knowledge (e.g., biological
determinism, economic rationalization, performances, and epistemes) that
make the very emergence of exclusionary categories like the human
possible. Without getting rid of these systems or artifacts, even if the
category of the human is eliminated from language, it will be replaced
with something else as long as biological determinism, economic
rationalization, oppositions, and lines continue to order and govern
thought. [The problem with the human is its scaffolding, not the
category itself.]{.underline} [The emergence of the human and
specifically the overrepresentation of the human as man depends on the
continual reproduction of and sometimes destruction of oppositional
frames--- in order to replace a structural oppositional with
another]{.underline}. Wynter contends that "all founding oppositions . .
. express the fact that humans as organized orders not only struggle
against the opposing "chaos," but have need of it as well, not only
destroying but also continually creating it."41 Over the course of
Wynter's work, there is a protracted discussion about the usefulness of
the opposition "order/chaos" as a primary ordering force, which has
persisted throughout time yet makes adjustments to what it posits as
abject difference or the chaotic outside of man at any given moment.
[Within the secular human's mode of man, the ordered self, culture, or
"we" needs the chaotic, not- us, or them]{.underline} in the Negro and
the Indian [in order to know itself as culture--- Logos, Reason--- and
therefore as human]{.underline}. [The human as man, in its ordered,
rational, gendered, sexed, European, bourgeois form, needs chaos in
order to secure a self, even as what is human changes.]{.underline}
[While the human as man may become elastic and more diverse]{.underline}
(as proletariat and woman), [it still requires an outside]{.underline}.
[It still requires chaos, even if those who were previously a part of
the realm of chaos enter into the zone of order. It is within this
lineated orbit of chaos and order that even nonrepresentational
poststructuralist theories retain the trace of the human as a narrow
ordering line of the self]{.underline} (even in subjectless guise). [The
line is but one **geo- epistemology of white posthumanist thought**. The
**Deleuzoguattarian "lines of flight,"** even as a nomadic line though
supposedly not attached to a self or a subject, **carry the specter and
trace of the human** in the **ordering and disciplining colonial lines
of flight of conquest**]{.underline}. As Wynter argues, [there are often
reversals of the order and hierarchies of structural oppositions; the
reversals fail to actually overcome and annihilate the need and desire
for structural opposition as an actual order of
knowledge]{.underline}.42 While "natural man" may prevail over
ecclesiastical, clergical, or theological man, [natural or rational man
still needs to create himself as the center or norm in relation to those
who lack rationality and reason (the Black and Native).]{.underline}
Similarly, poststructuralist theory may prevail over structuralist
narratives that center the self or the "I"; however, [the impulse to
kill and create the Indian without ancestors alongside crafting a new
self- annihilating posthumanist subject is still part of the order of
knowledge of structural opposition]{.underline}. [The **selfless,
subjectless, posthuman** still **persists as the realm of life** because
of the **annihilation of Indigenous and Black life.**]{.underline}
Within critical theories, [**Black and Native people** are **rendered
structuralist (or modernist and dead**) as **white self- actualizing
subjects disguise** themselves **as rhizomatic movements** that
**transcend representation and the human.** Epistemes such as the line
segregate the chaotic realm of death (Black and Native) from the
poststructuralist realm of life (white transcendence) through
**structural opposition marked with blood.**]{.underline} [The line is a
**humanist geo- form and geo- episteme**, which makes the kinds of
**segmentation that structural oppositions are based on**
possible]{.underline}.43 Humans must perceive and come to some social or
human agreement that lines even exist in the social (cultural) and
natural world. [Even in Deleuze and Guattari's ideal scenario in which
lines are drawn and (re)drawn again outside the state's mandates,
someone (as a subject) must still render them as an outside to
something.]{.underline}

#### The 1AC is a performance of white fluidity -- their forwarding of "becoming" is a ruse of subjectlessness that allows Settler's to rescue settler futurity at the expense of genocide.

[Poststructuralist traditions that attempt to transcend identity
actually function as a **ruse of subjectlessness**]{.underline}. In
fact, queer [subjectlessness and nonrepresentational rhizomes are an
**expression of a posthumanism** that **resuscitates normative
subjects** through the **death of Black and Indigenous
peoples.**]{.underline} Continental theory has not typically had the
stomach for sustaining an investigation of the kind of unspeakable
violence that enabled the Marxist worker, queer, and affective
subjectless discourses (one can only strive for subjectlessness if you
possess it) to exist. [The **erasure** of the (**white) body-as-
subject- as- ontology** has been more effective in **covering the bloody
trail of white/human- self- actualization** than it has been at
successfully offering a way around and beyond the **entrapments of
liberal humanism**]{.underline}. According to Amber Jamilla Musser,
[even in its postidentitarian and subjectless modes, continental
theories' transgressive moves (affective, sensational, masochistic) tend
to reinstantiate the white male]{.underline} (sometimes queer)
[subject]{.underline} that it hopes to overcome.44 While not throwing
away affect theory in Sensational Flesh, Musser scrutinizes white queer
theory's moves toward subjectless, futurelessnes, and masochism as
gestures that actually recover and reify a subject (often white male
gay) as they seek to annihilate the subject. Because of this, Musser
refuses to read sensations like masochism in an exceptional vein. She
explains, "I seek to reinvigorate these other ways of reading masochism,
particularly because reading it as exceptional reifies norms of
whiteness and masculinity and suppresses other modes of reading power,
agency, and experience."45 As Musser suspects, [those who claim a
radical subjectless must do so through the abjection of
others]{.underline}. Men who claim masochism must become like (or reify)
the position of the feminine-as- debased other without a self in order
to then occupy this position of subjectlessness. [A fixing of an abject
position through the (female, Black, Indigenous) body of the other must
occur]{.underline}; then, [an evacuation of the other's body must take
place in order for the embalming of or supplanting of the body with the
white normative male figure]{.underline}. While Musser does not entirely
refuse Deleuze and Guattari's nonrepresentational gesture, she does
practice a kind of detached and suspicious read of the forms of violence
that can be enacted in white moves beyond the human. Musser treats queer
theories' evangelists of loss and futurelessness, Leo Bersani and Lee
Edelman, as nonexceptional and even potentially dangerous to subjects
who inhabit the abject spaces that white bourgeois men try to occupy. In
the 2015 GLQ roundtable discussion titled "Queer Inhumanisms," Zakiyyah
Iman Jackson reiterated the suspicion that [posthumanism is a ruse for
white human ascendency.]{.underline} Similar to Musser, Jackson knows
that [there is often a subject lurking within the bowels or lines of
nonrepresentational discourse]{.underline}. Jackson indicts
**[posthumanist calls to move to the "beyond"]{.underline}** for
**[reproduc]{.underline}**ing a **[false and dishonest European
transcendentalism.]{.underline}** Thus [a call for **movement in the
direction of the "beyond**," issued in a manner that **suggests that
this call is without location,** and therefore with the **appearance of
incognizance** regarding its **situated claims and internal limits**,
returns us to a **Eurocentric transcendentalism**]{.underline} long
challenged.46 Jackson argues that a [call for movement beyond always
happens from a very specific place. The posthumanist's horn often blows
from a place situated securely within the folds of
humanity]{.underline}. [This is a very different place than the space of
nonbeing from which Black and Indigenous peoples moan, sing, or speak.
Native feminist refusal and Black feminist abolitionist skepticism
function as intervening comportments, dispositions, and modes of
critique that expose the violent and unself- conscious ways that Western
theory attempts to move beyond the human through the annihilation of the
Other]{.underline}. [Because the **crafting of the human is** a process
of relations, specifically the **relations of negation**, then **moving
beyond the violence of the human** is **also a relational
process**]{.underline}. **[Transcendence is a relational process of
accountability]{.underline}**. **[White subjects cannot transcend
identity]{.underline}** (e.g., whiteness, queerness), **[the
subject]{.underline}** (self- writing and autonomy**[), or the
human]{.underline}** (self- actualization) **[without ending Native
genocide and anti- Black racism]{.underline}**. [Identities, subjects,
and the human as they are currently configured come into formation
through processes of negation. If there is no plan to enable Black and
Indigenous life, then there is **no transcending the violence of the
human**]{.underline}. [The scholarship of Native/Indigenous and Black
feminists force continental theory to come outside itself and gaze on
the way even the various **attempts of nonrepresentational theory to
annihilate the self** actually **end up reinventing the subject and the
human** through **new forms of violent invention**]{.underline}. This
article argues that [both refusal and skepticism can work in tandem and
interrupt the performance of white innocence through less- than-
effective attempts to evade representation that jettison the garb of the
human without abolishing the need for Black and Indigenous
death]{.underline}.47

#### The affirmative's free flowingness and multiplicity places indigeneity as a transient quality -- "becoming" reduces the native to a colonial reverent, but never as a milieu from which becoming emerges. 

**Byrd 11** \[Jodi A. Byrd (Chickasaw) is assistant professor of
American Indian studies and English at the University of Illinois at
Urbana--Champaign.; "The Transit of Empire"; pp. 17-21; 2011;
https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-transit-of-empire#:\~:text=Jodi%20Byrd\'s%20book%20The%20Transit,the%20larger%20project%20of%20decolonization.\]//eleanor

[The Indian]{.underline}---as a threshold of past and future, regimes of
signs, alea, becoming, and death---[combats mechanisms of interpretation
through an asignifying disruption that stops, alters, and redirects
flow]{.underline}. This stopping of the world of signification is the
same as Derrida's "tattooed ~~savage~~" at the beginning of
deconstruction. [The Indian sign is the field through which
poststructuralism makes its intervention]{.underline}, and as a result,
this paradigmatic and pathological Indianness cannot be circumvented as
a colonialist trace. In fact, this [colonialist trace is exactly why
"the Indian" is so disruptive to flow and to
experimentation]{.underline}. [Every time **flow or a line of flight
approaches**, touches, or encounters Indianness, it also **confronts the
colonialist project** that has **made that flow possible**.]{.underline}
The choice is to either confront that colonialism or to deflect it. And
[not being prepared to disrupt the logics of settler colonialism
necessary for the terra nullius through which to wander, the entire
system either freezes or reboots]{.underline}. It seems slightly ironic,
then, that [many who pick up Deleuze and Guattari's work use language
similar to "Experiment, don't signify and interpret!" to describe the
possibilities of reframing the world through affect and affective
relationships that move toward the states of enchantment, ecstasy, and
the everyday.]{.underline} Brian Massumi's cultivation of deviation and
contagion to foster radicalism at the crossroads between science,
humanities, and cultural studies contains similar Castanedian staccato
imperatives: "Let it. Then reconnect it to other concepts, drawn from
other systems, until a whole new system of connection starts to form.
Then, take another example. See what happens. Follow the new growth. You
end up with many buds. Incipient systems."⁶⁶ In a gesture towards "a
thousand tiny races" in which he provides an alternative future for race
to that of Paul Gilroy's After Race, Arun Saldanha writes, "Race should
not be eliminated, but proliferated, its many energies directed at
multiplying racial differences so as to render them joyfully
cacophonic."⁶⁷ Jasbir Puar's delineation of the biopolitics of the now
in Terrorist Assemblages depends on A cacophony of informational flows,
energetic intensities, bodies, and practices that undermine coherent
identity and even queer anti-identity narratives . . . assemblages allow
for complicities of privilege and the production of new normativities
even as they cannot anticipate spaces and moments of resistance,
resistance that is not primarily characterized by oppositional stances,
but includes frictional forces, discomfiting encounters, and spurts of
unsynchronized delinquency.⁶⁸ Each of these [cultural studies moments
flow from the phrase **"Experiment, don't signify and interpret!"** that
functions as a call for transformational new worlds of relation and
relationship that move us toward a **joyously cacophonic multiplicity**
and away from the **lived colonial conditions of indigeneity** within
**the postcolonizing settler society**]{.underline}.⁶⁹ [This Deleuzian
and Guattarian motif]{.underline}, even if it acknowledges all the
divergent discourses that come into race, gender, sexual, and class
assemblages, [smoothes once again into uncultivated wilderness that
allows any trajectory or cultivation to enter it, but not arise from
it.]{.underline} By extension, and even if one cannot access how these
evocations of "the Indian" function within the plateaus opened by
Deleuze and Guattari, ["the Indian" serves as an **errant return of the
repressed** that **spreads along its own line of infection** once the
theory is taken up]{.underline}.⁷⁰ For example, Jasbir Puar, by
restricting her analysis to the biopolitics of the post-9/11 coming out
of U.S. empire as "an event in the Deleuzian sense, privileging lines of
flight, an assemblage of spatial and temporal intensities, coming
together, dispersing, reconverg- ing," can discuss as sui generis the
monster-terrorist-~~fag~~ that emerges in the twenty-first century as a
new phenomenon, despite the Wanted posters in New York the week after
9/11 that compared Osama bin Laden to Geronimo.⁷¹ Additionally, Puar
discusses Jessica Lynch as a "heroic girlnext-door" in conversation with
a "depraved, cigarette-toting, dark-haired, pregnant and unmarried,
racialized" Lynndie England at Abu Ghraib. Puar does not even
acknowledge Hopi Lori Piestewa, reportedly the first American Indian
woman to die in combat while fighting for the United States. Piestewa
died in the same attack in which Jessica Lynch was captured, and her
absence is a telling amnesia within Puar's discussion of how
"nostalgically mourning the loss of the liberal feminist subject"
converges "white liberal feminists and white gay men" and "unwittingly
reorganizes the Abu Ghraib tragedy around their desires" through the now
racialized body of the no longer white Lynndie England.⁷² Piestewa's
absence is yet another deferral that vanishes the violences done to
indigenous women, and those same indigenous soldiers' cathexis of U.S.
nationalism and imperialism that signals an indigenationalism compatriot
to the homonationalism that Puar defines as "the arrangements of U.S.
sexual exceptionalisms \[marked\] explicitly in relation to the nation"
that demobilize queer identities by normativizing certain bodies but not
others within the enfranchisements of the state.⁷³ To phrase this
slightly differently, [the Indian is]{.underline} simultaneously,
multiply, [a **colonial, imperial referent** that continues to produce
knowledge about the indigenous as "primitive" and "savage" otherness
within poststructuralist and postcolonial theory and philosophy. As a
philosophical sign, **the Indian is the transit**, the **field through
which presignifying polyvocality** is **re/introduced into the
signifying regime**, and signs begin to proliferate through a series of
becomings---**becoming-animal**, **becoming-woman**,
**becoming-Indian**, **becoming-multiplicity**---that **serves all
regimes of signs**. And the Indian is a **ghost in the system**, an
**errant or virus** that **disrupts the virtual flows** by **stopping
them, redirecting them**, or **revealing them** to be what they are and
will have been all along: colonialist. The Indian, then, is a Deleuzian
event within poststructuralism:]{.underline} "To the extent that events
are actualized in us," Deleuze writes, "they wait for us and invite us
in."⁷⁴ For Derrida, as he grieved and mourned the loss of his friend and
colleague, and saw in that loss the passing of a generation of thought,
the event in Deleuze's work becomes the Event, death, the paradox of
humorous conformity of a leaping in place, an apotheosis of will. "'It
is in this sense that Amor fati is one with the struggle of free men,'"
Derrida quotes from Deleuze.⁷⁵ Nietzsche's love of fate, the invitation
inherent in the will of the event opposes the ressentiment of
resignation to become the point "at which war is waged against war, the
wound would be the living trace of all wounds, and death turned on
itself would be willed against all death."⁷⁶ On the threshold, then, of
"the necessity with the aleatory, chaos and the untimely" that is both
the work of Derrida's mourning of Deleuze and the haksuba of
Southeastern cosmologies that Choctaw scholar LeAnne Howe defines in her
work as headache, chaos, the collision of Upper and Lower Worlds
initiated by colonialism, the Indian wills against the signifying
system.⁷⁷ [That the Indian represents the violent slamming of worlds in
what might otherwise be fluidity and flow helps us frame the problem
within a U.S. empire, with ties to Enlightenment liberalism, that
continues to transit itself globally along lines put to flight by "the
Indian without ancestry" that makes everyone its progeny. It is untimely
as a **site of the death of signification.**]{.underline} That haksuba
can additionally mean "to be stunned with noise, confused, deafened"
signals the degree to which cacophony, whether joyous or colonialist,
hinges upon the disruptions caused when "[the Indian" collides with the
racial, gendered, classed, and sexed normativities of an imperialism
that has arisen out of an ongoing settler colonialism]{.underline}.⁷⁸
The Southeastern cosmologies of the Chickasaw and Choctaw imagine worlds
with relational spirals and a center that does not so much hold as
stretches, links, and ties everything within to worlds that look in all
directions. It is an ontology that privileges balance, but understands
that we are constant movement and exist simultaneously among Upper and
Lower Worlds, this world and the next. In her poem "The Place the
Musician Became a Bear," Mvskoke poet and musician Joy Harjo sings about
how Southeastern Indians have always known "where to go to become
ourselves again in the human comedy. / It's the how that baffles, the
saxophone can complicate things."⁷⁹ Harjo reminds us that [there is
always a prior "becoming-human]{.underline}" within Southeastern worlds
that links us to the complications and improvisations of stars, spirals,
and jazz. [Much of the scholarship on U.S. imperialism and its possible
postcoloniality sees it as enough to challenge the wilderness as
anything but vacant; to list the annihilation of indigenous nations,
cultures, and languages in a chain of --isms; and then still to relegate
American Indians to the site of the already-doneness that begins to
linger as unwelcome guest to the future.]{.underline} This last is
particularly relevant to understanding how [the United States propagates
itself as empire transhemispherically and transoceanically, not just
through whiteness, but through the **continued settling and colonizing**
of indigenous peoples' lands, histories, identities, and very lives that
**implicate all arrivants and settlers** regardless of their own
experiences of race, class, gender, colonial, and imperial oppressions.
My point in **tracing the Deleuzian wilderness** and the Indian deferred
is to **detail the ways** in which "**the Indian" is put to flight**
within **Western philosophical traditions** in order to understand how
the United States **transits itself globally as an imperial project.**
As Derrida and Deleuze are evoked within affect theories, the
"Indian"]{.underline} and "tattooed ~~savages~~" [remain as
traces]{.underline}. **[Any assemblage that arises from such horizons
becomes a colonialist one,]{.underline}** and it is the work of
indigenous critical theory both to rearticulate indigenous
phenomenologies and to provide (alter)native interpretative strategies
through which to apprehend the **[colonialist nostalgias]{.underline}**
that [continue to shape affective liberal democracy's investment in
state sovereignty as a source of violence, remedy, memory, and
grievability]{.underline}.

#### Embracing "fluidity" and "flux" pathologizes tribal notions of fixed relationships to land and place.

[The **forces of identity appropriation**, **cultural encroachment**,
and **corporate commodification** pressure American Indian communities
to employ essen- tialist tactics and **construct relatively fixed
notions of identity**, and to render the **concepts of fluidity and
transgression highly problematic**]{.underline}. It is evident from the
examples above that **[the notion of fluid boundaries]{.underline}**
[has **never worked to the advantage of Indigenous peoples**: **federal
agencies have in- voked** the **language offluid or unstable
identities** as the **rationale** for **disman- tling the structures of
tribal life** and creating greater dependency on the U.S. government;
**Whitestream America** has **seized its message** to declare open
season on Indians, thereby **appropriating Native lands, culture,
spiritual practices, history, and literature**; and **Whitestream
academics** have now **em- ployed the language of postmodern fluidity**
to]{.underline} unwittingly [**transmute centu- ries of war** between
Indigenous peoples and their respective nation-states into a \"genetic
and cultural dialogue]{.underline}\" (Valle & Torres, 1995, p. 141).
Thus, in spite of its aspirations to social justice, the notion of a new
cultural democ- racy based on the ideal of mestizaje represents a rather
ominous threat to American Indian communities. In addition, **[the
undercurrent of fluidity]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[sense of
displacedness]{.underline}** that permeates, if not defines, mestizaje
[runs contrary to American Indian sensi- bilities of **connection to
place, land, and the Earth** itself.]{.underline} Consider, for exam-
ple, the following statement on the nature of critical subjectivity by
Peter Mc- Laren: The struggle for critical subjectivity is the struggle
to occupy a space of hope --- a liminal space, an intimation of the
anti-structure, Of What lives in the in-between zone of
undecided-ability --- in which one can work toward a praxis of redemp-
tion\.... A sense of atopy has always bccn with me, a resplendent
placelessness, a feeling ofliving in germinal formlessness\.... I cannot
find words to express what this border identity means to me. All I have
are what Gcorgres Bastille (1988) calls mots glissants (slippery words).
(1997, pp. 13---14) McLaren speaks passionately and directly about the
crisis of modern society and the need for a \"praxis of redemption.\" As
he perceives it, the very possi- bility of redemption is situated in our
willingness not only to accept but to flourish in the \"liminal\"
spaces, border identities, and postcolonial hybrid- ities that are
inherent in postmodern life and subjectivity. In fact, McLaren perceives
the fostering of a \"resplendent placelessness\" itself as the gateway
to a more just, democratic society. [While American Indian intellectuals
also seek to embrace the notion of transcendent subjectivities, they
seek a notion of transcendence that remains **rooted in historical
place** and the **sacred connection to land**]{.underline}. Consider,
for example, the following commentary by Deloria (1992) on the
centrality of place and land in the construction of American Indian
subjectivity: [Recognizing the sacredness of lands on which previous
generations have lived and died is the foundation of all other
sentiment]{.underline}. Instead of denying this di- mension of our
emotional lives, we should be setting aside additional places that have
transcendent meaning. Sacred sites that higher spiritual powers have
chosen for manifestation enable us to focus our concerns on the specific
form Of our lives\.... [Sacred places are the foundation of all other
beliefs and prac- tices because they represent the presence of the
sacred in Our lives. They prop- crly inform us that we are not larger
than nature and that we have responsibili- ties to the rest of the

(pp. 278, 281) [Gross misunderstanding of this connection between
American Indian sub- jectivity and land, and, more importantly, between
sovereignty and land has been the source of numerous injustices in
Indian country]{.underline}. For instance, I be- lieve there was little
understanding on the part of government officials that passage of the
Indian Religious Freedom Act (1978) would open a Pandora\'s box of
discord over land, setting up an intractable conflict between property
rights and religious freedom. American Indians, on the other hand,
viewed the act as a invitation to return to their sacred sites, several
of which were on government lands and were being damaged by commercial
use. As a result, a flurry of lawsuits alleging mismanagement and
destruction of sacred sites was filed by numerous tribes. Similarly,
corporations, tourists, and even rock climbers filed suits accusing land
managers of unlawfully restricting access to public places by
implementing policies that violate the constitutional separa- tion
between church and state. All of this is to point out that the critical
pro- ject of mestizaje continues to operate on the same assumption made
by the U. S. government in this instance, that in a democratic society,
human subjec- riviry --- and liberation for that matter --- is conceived
of as inherently rights- based as opposed to land-based. To be fair, I
believe that both American Indian intellectuals and critical theorists
share a similar vision --- a time, place, and space free of the compul-
sions Of Whitestream, global capitalism and the racism, sexism,
classism, and xenophobia it engenders. But where [critical scholars
ground their vision in Western conceptions of democracy and justice that
presume a \*liberated\" self]{.underline}, [American Indian
intellectuals ground their vision in conceptions of sov- ereignty that
presume a sacred connection to place and land.]{.underline} Thus, to a
large degree, [the **seemingly liberatory constructs** of **fluidity,
mobility, and trans- gression** are perceived not only as the language
of critical subjectivity, but also as part of the **fundamental lexicon
Of Western imperialism**]{.underline}. Deloria (1999) writes: Although
the loss of land must be seen as a political and economic disaster of
the first magnitude, the real exile of the tribes occurred With the
destruction Of ceremonial life (associated with the loss of land) and
the failure or inability of white society to offer a sensible and
cohesive alternative to the traditions which Indians remembered. People
became disoriented with respect to the world in which they lived. They
could not practice their old ways, and the new ways which they were
expected to learn were in a constant State Of change because they were
not a cohesive view of the world but simply adjustments which whites
were making to the technology they had invented. (p. 247). In summary,
[insofar as American Indian identities continue to be defined and shaped
in interdependence with place, the transgressive]{.underline} mestizaje
[func- tions as a potentially homogenizing force that presumes the
continued exile of tribal peoples and their enduring absorption into the
American \"demo- cratic\" Whitestream.]{.underline} The notion of
mestizaje as absorption is particularly problematic for the Indigenous
peoples of Central and South America, where the myth of the mestizaje
(belief that the continent\'s original cultures and inhabitants no
longer exist) has been used for centuries to force the in- tegration of
Indigenous communities into the national mestizo model (Van Cott, 1994).
According to Rodolfo Stavenhagen (1992) , the myth of mestiza- je has
provided the ideological pretext for numerous South American gov-
ernmental laws and policies expressly designed to strengthen the nation-
state through incorporation of all \"non-national\" (read
\"Indigenous\") ele- ments into the mainstream. Thus, What Valle and
Torres (1995) previously describe as \"the continent\'s unfinished
business of cultural hybridization\" (p. 141), Indigenous peoples view
as the continents\' long and bloody battle to absorb their existence
into the master narrative of the mestizo. While critical scholars do
construct a very different kind of democratic solidarity that disrupts
the sociopolitical and economic hegemony of the dominant culture around
a transformed notion of mestizaje (one committed to the destabilization
of the isolationist narratives of nationalism and cul- tural
chauvinism), I argue that [any liberatory project that does not begin
with a clear understanding of the difference of American Indianness
will, in the end, work to undermine tribal life.]{.underline} Moreover,
there is a potential danger that the ostensibly \"new\" cultural
democracy based upon the radical mes- tizaje will continue to mute
tribal differences and erase distinctive Indian identities. Therefore,
[as the physical and metaphysical borders of the post- modern world
**become increasingly fluid**, the desire of American Indian communities
to **protect geographic borders** and **employ \"essentialist\"
tactics** also increases.]{.underline} Though such tactics may be viewed
by critical scholars as highly problematic, they are viewed by American
Indian intellectuals as a last line of defense against the steady
erosion of tribal culture, political sover- eignty, Native resources,
and Native lands. [The tensions described above indicate the dire need
for an Indigenous, revolutionary theory that maintains the
distinctiveness of American Indians as tribal peoples of sovereign
nations]{.underline} (border patrolling) [and also encour- ages the
building of coalitions and political solidarity]{.underline} (border
crossing). In contrast to critical scholars McLaren and Kris Gutierrez
(1997) , who admon- ish educators to develop a concept of and difference
as political mobili- zation rather than cultural authenticity, I urge
American Indian intellectuals to develop a language that operates at the
crossroads of unity and difference and defines this space in terms of
political mobilization and cultural authen- ticity, thus expressing both
the interdependence and distinctiveness of tribal peoples.

#### The affirmative is a settler move to innocence par excellence -- pedagogical projects of critical enlightenment through research and knowledge production do not translate into action but rather serve as a diversion that attempt to displace settler culpability without giving up land or power.

Fanon told us in 1963 that decolonizing the mind is the first step, not
the only step toward overthrowing colonial regimes. Yet we wonder
whether **[[another settler move to innocence is to focus on
decolonizing the mind]{.mark}, or the cultivation of critical
consciousness, [as if it were the sole activity of decolonization; to
allow conscientization to stand in for the]{.mark} more [uncomfortable
task of relinquishing stolen]{.mark} [land]{.mark}.]{.underline}** We
agree that curricula, literature, and pedagogy can be crafted to aid
people in learning to see settler colonialism, to articulate critiques
of settler epistemology, and set aside settler histories and values in
search of ethics that reject domination and exploitation; this is not
unimportant work. However, [the [front-loading]{.mark} of [critical
consciousness]{.mark} building can [waylay decolonization,]{.mark} even
though the experience of teaching and learning to be critical of settler
colonialism can be so powerful it can feel like it is indeed making
change. Until stolen land is relinquished, critical [consciousness does
not translate into action]{.mark} that disrupts settler
colonialism]{.underline}. So, we respectfully disagree with George
Clinton and Funkadelic (1970) and En Vogue (1992) when they assert that
if you "free your mind, the rest (your ass) will follow."

Paulo Freire, eminent education philosopher, popular educator, and
liberation theologian, wrote his celebrated book, Pedagogy of the
Oppressed, in no small part as a response to Fanon's Wretched of the
Earth. Its influence upon critical pedagogy and on the practices of
educators committed to social justice cannot be overstated. Therefore,
it is important to point out significant differences between Freire and
Fanon, especially with regard to de/colonization. Freire situates the
work of liberation in the minds of the oppressed, an abstract category
of dehumanized worker vis-a-vis a similarly abstract category of
oppressor. This is a sharp right turn away from Fanon's work, which
always positioned the work of liberation in the particularities of
colonization, in the specific structural and interpersonal categories of
Native and settler. Under Freire's paradigm, it is unclear who the
oppressed are, even more ambiguous who the oppressors are, and it is
inferred throughout that an innocent third category of enlightened human
exists: "those who suffer with \[the oppressed\] and fight at their
side" (Freire, 2000, p. 42). These words, taken from the opening
dedication of Pedagogy of the Oppressed, invoke the same settler fantasy
of mutuality based on sympathy and suffering.

Fanon positions decolonization as chaotic, an unclean break from a
colonial condition that is already over determined by the violence of
the colonizer and unresolved in its possible futures. By contrast,
Freire positions liberation as redemption, a freeing of both oppressor
and oppressed through their humanity. Humans become 'subjects' who then
proceed to work on the 'objects' of the world (animals, earth, water),
and indeed read the word (critical consciousness) in order to write the
world (exploit nature). For Freire, there are no Natives, no Settlers,
and indeed no history, and the future is simply a rupture from the
timeless present. Settler colonialism is absent from his discussion,
implying either that it is an unimportant analytic or that it is an
already completed project of the past (a past oppression perhaps).
Freire's theories of liberation resoundingly echo the allegory of
Plato's Cave, a continental philosophy of mental emancipation, whereby
the thinking man individualistically emerges from the dark cave of
ignorance into the light of critical consciousness.

By contrast, black feminist thought roots freedom in the darkness of the
cave, in that well of feeling and wisdom from which all knowledge is
recreated. These places of possibility within ourselves are dark because
they are ancient and hidden; they have survived and grown strong through
darkness. Within these deep places, each one of us holds an incredible
reserve of creativity and power, of unexamined and unrecorded emotion
and feeling. The woman\'s place of power within each of us is neither
white nor surface; it is dark, it is ancient, and it is deep. (Lorde,
1984, pp. 36-37)

Audre Lorde's words provide a sharp contrast to Plato's sight-centric
image of liberation: "The white fathers told us, I think therefore I am;
and the black mothers in each of us - the poet - whispers in our dreams,
I feel therefore I can be free" (p. 38). For Lorde, writing is not
action upon the world. Rather, poetry is giving a name to the nameless,
"first made into language, then into idea, then into more tangible
action" (p. 37). Importantly, freedom is a possibility that is not just
mentally generated; it is particular and felt.

Freire's [philosophies have encouraged educators to use "colonization"
as a metaphor for oppression. In such a paradigm, "[internal
colonization" reduces to "mental colonization]{.mark}", logically
leading to the solution of decolonizing one's mind and the rest will
follow. [Such]{.mark} philosophy conveniently [sidesteps the most
unsettling]{.mark} of [questions]{.mark}:]{.underline}

The essential thing is to see clearly, to think clearly - that is,
dangerously and to answer clearly the innocent first question: [what,
fundamentally, is colonization?]{.underline} (Cesaire, 2000, p. 32)

Because colonialism is comprised of global and historical relations,
Cesaire's question must be considered globally and historically.
However, it cannot be reduced to a global answer, nor a historical
answer. To do so is to use colonization metaphorically. "What is
colonization?" must be answered specifically, with attention to the
colonial apparatus that is assembled to order the relationships between
particular peoples, lands, the 'natural world', and 'civilization'.
Colonialism is marked by its specializations. In North America and other
settings, settler sovereignty imposes sexuality, legality, raciality,
language, religion and property in specific ways. Decolonization
likewise must be thought through in these particularities.

To agree on what \[decolonization\] is not: neither evangelization, nor
a philanthropic enterprise, nor a desire to push back the frontiers of
ignorance, disease, and tyranny\... (Cesaire, 2000, p. 32) We
deliberately extend Cesaire's words above to assert what [decolonization
is not]{.underline}. It is not [converting Indigenous politics to a
Western doctrine of liberation; it is not a philanthropic process of
'helping' the at-risk and alleviating suffering; it is not a generic
term for struggle against oppressive conditions and outcomes. The broad
umbrella of social justice may have room underneath for all of these
efforts. By contrast, decolonization specifically requires the
repatriation of Indigenous land and life. **[Decolonization is not a
metonym for social justice.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

We don't intend to discourage those who have dedicated careers and lives
to teaching themselves and others to be critically conscious of racism,
sexism, homophobia, classism, xenophobia, and settler colonialism. [We
are asking them/you to consider how the pursuit of critical
consciousness, the **[pursuit of social justice through a critical
enlightenment, can]{.mark} also [be settler moves to
innocence]{.mark}** - **[diversions]{.mark}, distractions,**
[which]{.mark} [relieve the settler of]{.mark} **feelings of guilt or
[responsibility]{.mark}**[, and **conceal the need to give up
land**]{.mark} **or power or privilege**.]{.underline}

Anna Jacobs' 2009 Master's thesis explores the possibilities for what
she calls white harm reduction models. [Harm reduction models attempt to
reduce the harm or risk of specific practices.]{.underline} Jacobs
identifies white supremacy as a public health issue that is at the root
of most other public health issues. The goal of white harm reduction
models, Jacobs says, is to reduce the harm that white supremacy has had
on white people, and the deep harm it has caused non-white people over
generations. Learning from Jacobs' analysis, [[we understand the]{.mark}
curricular [pedagogical project of critical consciousness as settler
harm reduction, crucial in the resuscitation of]{.mark} practices and
intellectual [life outside of settler ontologies]{.mark}. (Settler) harm
reduction is intended only as a stopgap.]{.underline} As the
environmental crisis escalates and peoples around the globe are exposed
to greater concentrations of violence and poverty, the need for settler
harm reduction is acute, profoundly so. At the same time we remember
that, by definition, [settler harm reduction, like **[conscientization,
is not the same as decol]{.mark}onization [and does not]{.mark}
inherently [offer]{.mark} any [pathways that lead to
decol]{.mark}onization.**]{.underline}

[An ethic of incommensurability, which guides moves that unsettle
innocence, stands in contrast to aims of reconciliation, which motivate
settler moves to innocence. Reconciliation is about rescuing settler
normalcy, about rescuing a settler future. Reconciliation is concerned
with questions of what will decolonization look like?]{.underline} What
will happen after abolition? [What will be the consequences of
decolonization for the settler?]{.underline} [Incommensurability
acknowledges that these questions need not, and perhaps cannot, be
answered in order for decolonization to exist as a
framework.]{.underline}

We want to say, first, that [**decolonization is not obliged to answer**
those questions]{.underline} - [decolonization is **not accountable to
settlers, or settler futurity**. Decolonization is **accountable to
Indigenous sovereignty and futurity**]{.underline}. Still, we
acknowledge the questions of those wary participants in Occupy Oakland
and other settlers who want to know what decolonization will require of
them. [The answers are not fully in view and can't be as long as
decolonization remains punctuated by metaphor. The answers will not
emerge from friendly understanding, and indeed require a dangerous
understanding of uncommonality that un-coalesces coalition politics -
moves that may feel very unfriendly. But we will find out the answers as
we get there, "in the exact measure that we can discern the movements
which give \[decolonization\] historical form and content"]{.underline}
(Fanon, 1963, p. 36).

[To fully enact an ethic of incommensurability means **relinquishing
settler futurity**, abandoning the hope that settlers may one day be
commensurable to Native peoples. It means **removing the asterisks**,
**periods**, **commas**, **apostrophes**, **the whereas's**, **buts, and
conditional clauses** that **punctuate decolonization** and **underwrite
settler innocence.**]{.underline} [The Native futures, the lives to be
lived once the settler nation is gone - these are the unwritten
possibilities made possible by an ethic of
incommensurability.]{.underline}

[Decolonization offers a different perspective to human and civil rights
based approaches to justice, an unsettling one, rather than a
complementary one. Decolonization is not an "and". It is an

This article tracks how [traditions of "decolonial refusal" and
"abolitionist skepticism" that emerge from Native/Indigenous and Black
studies expose the limits and violence of contemporary nonidentitarian
and nonrepresentational impulses within white "critical"
theory.]{.underline} Further, this article asks whether Western forms of
nonrepresentational (subjectless and nonidentitarian) theory can truly
transcend the human through self- critique, selfabnegation, and
masochism alone. External pressure, specifically [the kind of pressure
that "decolonial refusal" and "abolitionist skepticism" as forms of
resistance that enact outright rejection of or view "posthumanist"
attempts with a "hermeneutics of suspicion]{.underline},"7 [is needed in
order to truly address the recurrent problem of the violence of the
human in continental theory.]{.underline} While this article does not
directly stake a claim in embracing or rejecting identity per se, it
does take up the category of the human. Because [the category of the
human is modified by identity in ways that position certain people
(white, male, able- bodied) within greater or lesser proximity to
humanness, identity is already taken up in this discussion]{.underline}.
Conversations about the human are very much tethered to conversations
about identity. In the final section, the article will explore how Black
and Native/Indigenous absorption into the category of the human would
disfigure the category of the human beyond recognition. Engaging how
forms of Native decolonization and Black abolition scrutinize the
violently exclusive means in which the human has been written and
conceived is generative because it sets some workable terms of
engagement for interrogating Western and mainstream claims to and
disavowals of identity. Rather than answer how Native decolonization and
Black abolition construe the human or identity, the article examines how
Native and Black feminists use refusal and misandry to question the very
systems, institutions, and order of knowledge that secure humanity as an
exclusive experience and bound identity in violent ways. I consider [the
practices and postures of refusal assumed by Native/Indigenous scholars
such as Audra Simpson, Eve Tuck, Jodi Byrd, and Linda Tuhiwai Smith to
be]{.underline} particularly [instructive for exposing the violence of
ostensibly nonrepresentational Deleuzoguattarian rhizomes and lines of
flight]{.underline}. While reparative readings and "working with what is
productive" about Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's work is certainly
a part of the Native feminist scholarly tradition, this article focuses
on the underexamined ways that [**Native feminists refuse** to entertain
**certain logics and foundations** that actually **structure
Deleuzoguattarian thought**]{.underline}.8 Further, I discuss
"decolonial refusal" in relation to how [Black scholars like Sylvia
Wynter, Zakiyyah Iman Jackson, and Amber Jamilla Musser work within a
Black feminist tradition animated by a kind of skepticism or suspicion
capable of **ferreting out the trace of the white liberal human** within
**(self- )professed subjectless**, **futureless, and
nonrepresentational** **white theoretical traditions**]{.underline}. In
other words, in the work of Sylvia Wynter, [one senses a general
suspicion and deep distrust of the ability of Western
theory]{.underline}--- specifically its attempt at self- critique and
self- correction in the name of justice for humanity[--- to revise its
cognitive orders to work itself out of its current "closed system,"
which reproduces exclusion and structural oppositions based on the
negation of the other.]{.underline}9 Wynter's study of decolonial theory
and its elaboration of autopoiesis informs her understanding of how the
human and its overrepresentation as man emerges. Recognizing that humans
(of various genres) write themselves through a "self- perpetuating and
self- referencing closed belief system" that often prevents them from
seeing or noticing "the process of recursion," Wynter works to expose
these blind spots.10 Wynter understands that [one of the limitations of
Western liberal thought is that it cannot see itself in the process of
writing itself.]{.underline} I observe a similar kind of cynicism about
the way the academic left invokes "post humanism" in the work of Jackson
and Musser. Musser in particular questions the capacity of queer
theories to turn to sensations like masochism within the field of affect
studies to overcome the subject. Further, Jackson's and Musser's work is
skeptical that white transcendence can happen on its own terms or rely
solely on its own processes of self- critique and self- correction. I
read Jackson's and Musser's work as distrustful of the ability for
"posthumanism" to be accountable to Black and Indigenous peoples or for
affect theory on its own to not replicate and reinforce the subjugation
of the other as it moves toward self- annihilation. Both the human and
the post human are causes for suspicion within Black studies. Like
Wynter, the field of Black studies has consistently made the liberal
human an object of study and scrutiny, particularly the nefarious manner
in which it violently produces Black existence as other than and at
times nonhuman. Wynter's empirical method of tracking the internal
epistemic crises and revolutions of Europe from the outside has
functioned as a model for one way that Black studies can unfurl a
critique of the human as well as Western modes of thought. I use the
terms "misanthropy" and "misandry" in this article to evoke how Black
studies has remained attentive to, wary about, and deeply distrustful of
the human condition, humankind, and the humanas- man/men in the case of
Black "feminists." Both Black studies' distrust of the "human" and Black
feminism's distrust of humanism in its version as man/men (which at
times seeks to incorporate Black men) relentlessly scrutinize how the
category of the human and in this case the "posthuman" reproduce Black
death. I link misandry (skepticism of humankind- as- man) to the kind of
skepticism and "hermeneutics of suspicion" that Black feminist scholars
like Wynter, Jackson, and Musser at times apply to their reading and
engagement with revisions to or expansions of the category of the human,
posthuman discourses, and nonrepresentational theory. In this article, I
connect [discursive performance of skepticism]{.underline} to embodied
[and affective responses]{.underline} I have witnessed in the academy
that [challenge the sanctioned modes of protocol, politesse, and decorum
in the university]{.underline}. For example, Wynter assumes a critically
disinterested posture as she gazes empirically on and examines intra-
European epistemic shifts over time. Paget Henry has described Wynter as
an anthropologist of the Occident, as Europe becomes an object of study
rather than the center of thought and humanity.11 Throughout the body of
Wynter's work, she seems to be more interested in drawing our attention
to the capacity of European orders of knowledge to shift over time--- or
their fragility--- than in celebrating the progress that European
systems of knowledge have claimed to make. Wynter's tracking is just a
tracking and not a celebration of the progress narrative that Western
civilization tells about itself and its capacity to define, refine, and
recognize new kinds of humanity over time. This comportment of critical
disinterest is often read as an affront to the codes and customs of
scholarly discourse and dialogue in the academic community, particularly
when it is in response to the white thinkers of the Western cannon.
[**Decolonial refusal** and **abolitionist skepticism** respond to how
**perverse and reprehensible** it is **to ask Indigenous and Black
people** who **cannot seem to escape death** to **move beyond** the
**human or the desire to be human.**]{.underline} In fact, [Black and
Indigenous people have never been fully folded into the category of the
human]{.underline}. As Zakiyyah Iman Jackson has argued, [It has largely
gone unnoticed by posthumanists that their queries into ontology often
find their homologous (even anticipatory) appearance in decolonial
philosophies that confront slavery and colonialism's inextricability
from the Enlightenment humanism they are trying to
displace]{.underline}. Perhaps this foresight on the part of decolonial
theory is rather unsurprising considering that [exigencies of race have
crucially anticipated and shaped discourses governing the non- human
(animal, technology, object, and plant]{.underline}).12 A crucial point
that Jackson emphasizes is that Black and Indigenous studies,
particularly decolonial studies, has already grappled with and
anticipated the late twentieth- century impulses inspired by Leo Bersani
and Lee Edelman to annihilate the self and jettison the future.
Indigenous and Black "sex" (as activity, reproduction, pleasure, world-
building, and not- human sexuality) are already subsumed by death. For
some reason, [white critical theory cannot seem to fathom that self-
annihilation is something white people need to figure out by
themse]{.underline}lves. In other words, "they can have that."13

Because of this, [Byrd haltingly stops the reader's momentum as she
critiques Deleuzoguattarian and poststructuralist tendencies that often
emerge in postcolonial work.]{.underline} [Rather than allow the
preemptive rejoinder that white and some postcolonial scholars use, such
as "I know that theorist X did not consider race or was racist, but he
enables us to do XYZ with his work]{.underline},"30 [Byrd instead cuts
off Deleuze and Guattari's rhizomatics at the path]{.underline}. As Byrd
anticipates that [**following Deleuze and Guattari will end in
genocide,** she allows the reader the time and space to let this reality
sink in and consider a different route than the normative impulse and
course of action that is to repair Deleuze and Guattari's work. Byrd's
work slows us down and brings us to a point of impasse and a resting
place where one can slow down, stop, and make a choice to stay put or
move forward with the dismissive, whimsical, white conceit that
tolerates Native death]{.underline}. Byrd's [refusal allows the reader
to feel the **violent puncture of the nonrepresentational gash that it
tries to disavow**]{.underline}. Byrd gives her reader the space and
time to say, "**[Yes, I understand your attempt to evade signification
and thus representation but it is not compelling enough for me to
overlook the reality that it requires Native genocide]{.underline}**."
The way that Byrd's and others' decolonial work brings these kinds of
tensions and violence to a head enables us to make other kinds of
analytic and conceptual choices. The reader is allowed to think and then
say, "[If this line of thought requires Indigenous death, why even
venture down it? **What could one possibly repair or salvage of
it?"**]{.underline} PARSING OUT THE "POST" FROM THE "DE" OF COLONIALIT Y
Byrd's work, which is often postcolonial and has cited Jasbir Puar's
appropriation of Deleuze and Guattari as an example, seeks out
opportunities to repair and reclaim Western modes of critique such as
feminism, queer, and nonrepresentational theories. [Postcolonial
work]{.underline} (as well as white settlercolonial studies) [often goes
along with the linearity and temporality of white equivocations that
attempt to excuse how the feminist, the queer (nonsubject), and
Deleuzoguattarian lines of connectivity function as parasitic forms of
situated knowledge and epistemes. This kind of **acquiescence** makes
the **epistemic revolutions internal to white European humanity**
possible and seem natural as they **dehumanize and kill Indigenous and
Black people**]{.underline}.31 [Byrd's indictment of Deleuze and
Guattari's rhizomatics **refuses and cuts off the colonial and
postcolonial equivocations**, **sanitization of affects**, and **speed
and pace of the rhizomatic and nomadic line.**]{.underline} As an
example of how the protocols, codes of conduct, and politesse of
postcolonial "business as usual" unfold in the university, I reflect on
my encounters as a student and now professor in the graduate classroom,
reading scholarly texts, listening, and taking part in scholarly
critique and the collegial repartee that occurs at academic conferences.
Within these scenarios, I have observed the decorum of supposedly
"engaged and rigorous" critique proceed in the following ways. Often
postcolonial interventions into colonial or critical theory travel
through phases, stages of progression, and levels of engagement with
continental philosophy. First, in order to demonstrate your scholarly
due diligence, capacity for rigor, and abstraction, you must learn and
rehearse the origins of and become fluent in the language, idioms, and
grammar of Deleuze and Guattari or whichever white scholar is in
fashion. Second, you must figuratively inhabit and empathize with the
white scholar's very personal and particular existential and ethical
questions (even if you cannot relate to her particular kind of
situatedness or experience). It is often in graduate seminars where you
have been asked--- and we have been trained as faculty--- to have you
think about what it must have been like to be Karl Marx, Michel
Foucault, or Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari in the moment in which
they lived. Imagine the trials and tribulations of being a European
bourgeois male maverick in the academy and civil society. In other
words, you must internalize and perform this worldview as if it applies
to you. After you internalize and perform, the third thing that [you are
allowed but by no means required to]{.underline} do is [list the
problems with this theory or worldview. Once you have identified the
problems, even irreconcilable ones, you are **[encouraged to make an
intervention or slight adjustment]{.mark}** to the discourse or theory
by **asserting that you will now put Indigenous or Black life at the
center** of this body of thought. The challenge or intervention usually
reads as "what if we put Native or Black studies at the center of
Deleuzoguattarian thought?" Although we may become disillusioned with
and challenge a metanarrative, we are rarely encouraged to]{.underline}
do what Eve Tuck does when she "[Break]{.underline}\[s\] [Up with
Deleuze." We are often prevented from getting to this stage of
exasperation or justified disgust because we are not allowed to stop,
look at, and more importantly feel the violence of Western turns in
critical theory]{.underline}. Because of [academic respectability
politics]{.underline} that [impose a kind of bourgeois politesse on all
"communicative acts," be they in person or in writing, it is impolite
and more importantly irrational to be rendered devastated,]{.underline}
enraged, ~~mute, or immobile~~ [by the violent terms on which
continental theory proceeds]{.underline}. [One must tolerate that
**Deleuzoguattarian rhizomatic movements require Indigenous
genocide**]{.underline}. In fact, [it is a **necessary evil** in order
for **the West to model** the kind of **unfettered nomadic movement**
that Deleuze and Guattari privilege. The neoliberal temporality of
productivity also requires that scholars keep moving unaffected in the
midst of the violence.]{.underline} In fact, **[one is required to work
through and repair or do damage control for Deleuze and
Guattari]{.underline}**. [**This is what a "good scholar" does**: **puts
Black or Native studies at the center of rhizomes rather than contesting
the very terms in which lines of flight become epistemic
entities**]{.underline}. But how do we perform or act otherwise in the
face of this kind of violence?

#### Settler move to innocence DA -- voting neg is necessary to produce settler discomfort -- anything less allows for settler recuperation.

**Tuck and Yang 12** \[Eve Tuck, Unangax, State University of New York

We observe that another component of a desire to play Indian is [[a
settler desire to be made innocent]{.mark}, to find some mercy or relief
[in face o]{.mark}f the relentlessness of settler [guilt]{.mark} and
haunting]{.underline} (see Tuck and Ree, forthcoming, on mercy and
haunting). Directly and indirectly [[benefitting from the
erasure]{.mark} and assimilation [of Indigenous peoples is a difficult
reality for settlers to accept]{.mark}]{.underline}. The weight of [this
reality is uncomfortable]{.underline}; the misery of guilt makes one
hurry toward any reprieve. In her 1998 Master's thesis, Janet Mawhinney
analyzed the ways in which [[white people maintained]{.mark} and
(re)produced white [privilege in self-defined anti-racist
settings]{.mark} and organizations]{.underline}.8 She examined the role
of storytelling and self-confession - [which serves to equate stories of
personal exclusion with stories of structural racism and
exclusion]{.underline} - and [what she terms 'moves to innocence,' or
"strategies to remove involvement in and culpability for systems of
domination]{.underline}" (p. 17). Mawhinney builds upon Mary Louise
Fellows and Sherene Razack's (1998) conceptualization of, 'the race to
innocence', "the process through which a woman comes to believe her own
claim of subordination is the most urgent, and that she is unimplicated
in the subordination of other women" (p. 335). Mawhinney's thesis
theorizes [[the self-positioning]{.underline}]{.mark} of white people
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} simultaneously [[the]{.underline} [oppressed
and never an oppressor]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} and as having
an absence of experience of oppressive power relations (p. 100). This
simultaneous self-positioning afforded white people in various
purportedly anti-racist settings to say to people of color, "I don't
experience the problems you do, so I don't think about it," and "tell me
what to do, you're the experts here" (p. 103). "The commonsense appeal
of such statements," Malwhinney observes, enables white speakers to
"utter them sanguine in \[their\] appearance of equanimity, is rooted in
the normalization of a liberal analysis of power relations" (ibid.). In
the discussion that follows, we will do some work to identify and argue
against a series of what we call 'settler moves to innocence'.
**[[Settler moves to innocence are those strategies or positionings that
attempt to relieve the settler of feelings of]{.mark} guilt or
[responsibility without giving up land or power]{.mark} or privilege,
[without having to change much at all]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In fact,
settler scholars may gain professional kudos or a boost in their
reputations for being so sensitive or self-aware. Yet [settler moves to
innocence are hollow, [they only serve the settler]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This discussion will likely cause discomfort in our settler readers, may
embarrass you/us or make us/you feel implicated. Because of the
racialized flights and flows of settler colonial empire described above,
settlers are diverse - there are white settlers and brown settlers, and
peoples in both groups make moves to innocence that attempt to deny and
deflect their own complicity in settler colonialism. When it makes sense
to do so, we attend to moves to innocence enacted differently by white
people and by brown and Black people. In describing settler moves to
innocence, our goal is to provide a framework of excuses, distractions,
and diversions from decolonization. We discuss some of the moves to
innocence at greater length than others, mostly because some require
less explanation and because others are more central to our initial
argument for the demetaphorization of decolonization. [We provide this
framework so that we can be]{.underline} more impatient with each other,
[less likely to accept gestures and half-steps, and more willing to
press for acts which unsettle innocence]{.underline}, which we discuss
in the final section of this article.

## Feminist Cyborg K

### 1NC\-\--Shell

#### The more robotic we become the better -- only as we reincarnate as the cyborg can feminism be uplifted

**Haraway 85** (Donna Haraway - American Professor Emerita in the
History of Consciousness Department and Feminist Studies Department at
the University of California, "A Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science,
Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980s", Australian Feminism
Studies, Pages 1-4, 1985, MG)

[A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a
creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. Social
reality is **lived social relations**, our most important political
construction, a world-changing fiction]{.underline}. The international
women\'s movements have constructed \'women\'s experience\', as well as
uncovered or discovered this crucial collective object. [This experience
is a fiction and fact of the most crucial, political kind. Liberation
rests on the construction of the consciousness, the imaginative
apprehension, of oppression, and so of possibility. The **cyborg** is a
**matter of fiction and lived experience** that changes what counts as
women\'s experience in the late twentieth century. This is a struggle
over **life and death**, but the boundary between science fiction and
social reality is an optical illusion.]{.underline}

[Contemporary science fiction is full of cyborgs --- creatures
simultaneously animal and machine, who populate worlds ambiguously
natural and crafted]{.underline}. Modern medicine is also full of
cyborgs, of couplings between organism and machine, each conceived as
coded devices, in an intimacy and with a power that was not generated in
the history of sexuality. Cyborg \'sex\' restores some of the lovely
replicative baroque of ferns and invertebrates (such nice organic
prophylactics against heterosexism). [Cyborg replication is
**uncoupled** from organic reproduction. Modern production seems like a
dream of cyborg colonization of work, a dream that makes the nightmare
of Taylorism seem idyllic. And modern war is a cyborg orgy, coded by C3
I, command-controlcommunication-intelligence]{.underline}, an \$84
billion item in 1984\'s U.S. defence budget[. I am making an argument
for the **cyborg as a fiction mapping our social and bodily reality**
and as an imaginative resource suggesting some very fruitful
couplings]{.underline}. Foucault\'s biopolitics is a flaccid premonition
of cyborg politics, a very open field.

[By the late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time, **we are all
chimeras**, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism; in
short, we are cyborgs. **The cyborg is our ontology; it gives us our
politics**. The cyborg is a condensed image of both imagination and
material reality, the two joined centers structuring any possibility of
historical transformation. In the traditions of \'Western\' science and
politics --- the tradition of racist, male-dominant capitalism; the
tradition of progress; the tradition of the appropriation of nature as
resource for the production of culture; the tradition of reproduction of
the self from the reflections of the other --- the relation between
organism and machine has been a border war. The stakesin the border war
have been the territories of production, reproduction, and
imagination]{.underline}. This essay is an argument for pleasure in the
confusion of boundaries and for responsibility\'\^ their construction.
[It is also an effort to contribute to socialist-feminist culture and
theory in a post-modernist, non-naturalist mode and in the Utopian
tradition of imagining a world without gender, which is perhaps a world
without genesis, but maybe also a world without end. **The cyborg
incarnation is outside salvation history.**]{.underline}

[The cyborg is a creature in a post-gender world; it has no truck with
bisexuality, pre-Oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labor]{.underline}, or
other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of
all the powers of the parts into a higher unity. [In a sense, the cyborg
has no origin story in the Western sense; a \'final\' irony since the
cyborg is also the awful apocalyptic telos of the \'West\'s\' escalating
dominations of abstract individuation, an ultimate self untied at last
from all dependency]{.underline}, a man in space. An origin story in the
\'Western\', humanist sense depends on the myth of original unity,
fullness, bliss and terror, represented by the phallic mother from whom
all humans must separate, the task of individual development and of
history, the twin potent myths inscribed most powerfully for us in
psychoanalysis and Marxism. Hilary Klein has argued that both Marxism
and psychoanalysis, in their concepts of labor and of individuation and
gender formation, depend on the plot of original unity out of which
difference must be produced and enlisted in a drama of escalating
domination of woman/nature. [The cyborg **skips the step of original
unity**, **of identification with nature** in the Western sense. This is
its illegitimate promise that might lead to subversion of its teleology
as star wars.]{.underline}

[The cyborg is resolutely committed to partiality, irony, intimacy, and
perversity. It is **oppositional**, Utopian, and completely without
innocence. No longer structured by the polarity of public and private,
the cyborg defines a technological polis based partly on a revolution of
social relations in the oikos, the household. Nature and culture are
reworked; the one can no longer be the resource for appropriation or
incorporation by the other. The relationships for forming wholes from
parts, including those of polarity and hierarchical domination, are at
issue in the cyborg world]{.underline}. Unlike the hopes of
Frankenstein\'s monster, the cyborg does not expect its father to save
it through a restoration of the garden; i.e., through the fabrication of
a heterosexual mate, through its completion in a finished whole, a city
and cosmos. [The cyborg **does not dream of community** on the model of
the organic family, this time without the Oedipal project. The cyborg
**would not recognize the Garden of Eden**; it is not made of mud and
cannot dream of returning to dust]{.underline}. Perhaps that is why I
want to see if cyborgs can subvert the apocalypse of returning to
nuclear dust in the manic compulsion to name the Enemy. Cyborgs are not
reverent; they do not re-member the cosmos. They are wary of holism, but
needy for connection --- they seem to have a natural feel for united
front politics, but without the vanguard party. [The main trouble with
cyborgs, of course, is that **they are the illegitimate offspring of
militarism and patriarchal capitalism**, not to mention state socialism.
But illegitimate offspring are often **exceedingly unfaithful to their
origins**. Their fathers, after all, are inessential.]{.underline}

#### Refusing to succumb to a cyborg world is complicit in the masculine orgy of war -- they had their chance to unify and they didn't, attempting to have them unify now fractures us all

**Haraway 85** (Donna Haraway - American Professor Emerita in the
History of Consciousness Department and Feminist Studies Department at
the University of California, "A Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science,
Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980s", Australian Feminism
Studies, Pages 7-9, 1985, MG)

[So my cyborg myth is about **transgressed boundaries, potent fusions,
and dangerous possibilities**]{.underline} which progressive people
might explore as one part of needed political work. One of my premises
is that most American [socialists and feminists see deepened dualisms of
mind and body, animal and machine, idealism and materialism in the
social practices, symbolic formulations, and physical artifacts
associated with \'high technology\' and scientific culture]{.underline}.
From One-Dimensional Man to The Death of Nature,6 the analytic resources
developed by progressives have insisted on the necessary domination of
technics and recalled us to an imagined organic body to integrate our
resistance. Another of my premises is that [the need for unity of people
trying to resist worldwide intensification of domination has never been
more acute. But a slightly perverse shift of perspective might better
enable us to **contest for meanings**, as well as for other forms of
power and pleasure in **technologically-mediated**
societies.]{.underline}

[From one perspective, a cyborg world is about the final imposition of a
grid of control on the planet, about the final abstraction embodied in a
Star War apocalypse waged in the name of defense, about the final
**appropriation of women\'s bodies in a masculinist orgy of war**.7 From
another perspective, a cyborg world might be about lived social and
bodily realities in which people are not afraid of their joint kinship
with animals and machines, not afraid of permanently partial identities
and contradictory standpoints]{.underline}. The political struggle is to
see from both perspectives at once because each reveals both dominations
and possibilities unimaginable from the other vantage point. Single
vision produces worse illusions than double vision or many-headed
monsters. [Cyborg unities are monstrous and illegitimate; in our present
political circumstances, we could hardly hope for more potent myths for
resistance and recouping. I like to imagine]{.underline} LAG, the
Livermore Action Group, as [a kind of **cyborg society**, dedicated to
realistically converting the laboratories that most fiercely embody and
spew out the tools of technological apocalypse, and committed to
building a political form that actually manages to hold together
witches, engineers, elders, perverts, Christians, mothers, and Leninists
long enough to disarm the state]{.underline}. Fission Impossible is the
name of the affinity group in my town. (Affinity: related not by blood
but by choice, the appeal of one chemical nuclear group for another,
avidity.)

Fractured identities

[It has become difficult to name one\'s feminism by a single adjective
--- or even to insist in every circumstance upon the noun.
**Consciousness of exclusion through naming is acute**. Identities seem
contradictory, partial, and strategic. With the hard-won recognition of
their social and historical constitution, gender, race, and class cannot
provide the basis for belief in \'essential\' unity. There is nothing
about being \'female\' that naturally binds women. There is not even
such a **state as \'being\' female,** itself a highly complex category
constructed in contested sexual scientific discourses and other social
practices. Gender, race, or class consciousness is an achievementforced
on us by the terrible historical experience of the contradictory social
realities of patriarchy, colonialism, and capitalism.]{.underline} And
who counts as \'us\' in my own rhetoric? Which identities are available
to ground such a potent political myth called \'us\', and what could
motivate enlistment in this collectivity? Painful fragmentation among
feminists (not to mention among women) along every possible fault line
has made the concept of woman elusive, an excuse for the matrix of
women\'s dominations of each other. For me --- and for many who share a
similar historical location in white, professional middle class, female,
radical, North American, mid-adult bodies --- [the sources of a crisis
in political identity are **legion**. The recent history for much of the
U.S. left and U.S. feminism has been a response to this kind of crisis
by endless splitting and searches for a new essential unity. But there
has also been a growing recognition of another response through
coalition --- affinity, not identity.8]{.underline}

#### Thus, you should vote negative to become the Cyborg -- control isn't cybernetic, it's aesthetic and oriented against women

**Haraway 85** (Donna Haraway - American Professor Emerita in the
History of Consciousness Department and Feminist Studies Department at
the University of California, "A Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science,
Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980s", Australian Feminism
Studies, Pages 17-19, 1985, MG)

[One should expect control strategies to concentrate on **boundary
conditions and interfaces**, on rates of flow across boundaries --- and
**not on the integrity of natural objects**]{.underline}. \'Integrity\'
or \'sincerity\' of the Western self gives way to decision procedures
and expert systems. For example, [co**ntrol strategies applied to
women\'s capacitie**s to give birth to new human beings will be
developed in the languages of population control and maximization of
goal achievement for individual decision-makers. Control strategies will
be formulated in terms of rates, costs of constraints, degrees of
freedom. Human beings, like any other component or subsystem, must be
localized in a system architecture whose basic modes of operation are
probabilistic, statistical. **No objects, spaces, or bodies are sacred
in themselves**; any component can be interfaced with any other if the
proper standard, the proper code, can be constructed for processing
signals in a common language]{.underline}. Exchange in this world
transcends the universal translation effected by capitalist markets that
Marx analyzed so well. The privileged pathology affecting all kinds of
components in this universe is stress --- communications breakdown.16
[The cyborg is not subject to Foucault\'s biopolitics; the **cyborg
simulates politics**, a much more potent field of
operations.]{.underline}

This kind of analysis of scientific and cultural objects of knowledge
which have appeared historically since World War II prepares us to
notice some important inadequacies in [feminist analysis]{.underline}
which has proceeded as if the organic, hierarchical dualisms ordering
discourse in \'the West\' since Aristotle still ruled. They [have been
**cannibalized**, or as Zoe Sofia (Sofoulis) might put it, they have
been **\'techno-digested\'**. The dichotomies between mind and body,
animal and human, organism and machine, public and private, nature and
culture, men and women, primitive and civilized are all in question
ideologically. The actual situation of women is their
integration/exploitation into a world system of production/ reproduction
and communication called the informatics of domination]{.underline}. The
home, workplace, market, public arena, the body itself --- all can be
dispersed and interfaced in nearly infinite, polymorphous ways, with
large consequences for women and others --- consequences that themselves
are very different for different people and which make potent
oppositional international movements difficult to imagine and essential
for survival. [One important route for reconstructing socialist-feminist
politics is through theory and practice addressed to the social
relations of science and technology, including crucially the systems of
myth and meanings structuring our imaginations. The cyborg is a kind of
**disassembled and reassembled**, post-modern collective and personal
self. **This is the self feminists must code.**]{.underline}

[Communications technologies and biotechnologies are the crucial tools
recrafting our bodies. These tools embody and enforce new social
relations for women worldwide. Technologies and scientific discourses
can be partially understood as formalizations, i.e., as frozen moments,
of the fluid social interactions constituting them, but they should also
be viewed as instruments for enforcing meanings]{.underline}. The
boundary is permeable between tool and myth, instrument and concept,
historical systems of social relations and historical anatomies of
possible bodies, including objects of knowledge. Indeed, myth and tool
mutually constitute each other.

Furthermore, communications sciences and modern biologies are
constructed by a common move --- [the translation of the world into a
**problem of coding**, a search for a common language in which all
resistance to instrumental control disappears and all **heterogeneity
can be submitted to disassembly**, reassembly, investment, and
exchange.]{.underline}

[In communications sciences, the translation of the world into a problem
in coding can be illustrated by looking at cybernetic (feedback
controlled) systems theories]{.underline} applied to telephone
technology, computer design, weapons deployment, or data base
construction and maintenance. In each case, [solution to the key
questions rests on a theory of **language and control**; the key
operation is determining the rates, directions, and probabilities of
flow of a quantity called information. The world is subdivided by
boundaries differentially permeable to information]{.underline}.
Information is just that kind of quantifiable element (unit, basis of
unity) which allows universal translation, and so unhindered
instrumental power (called effective communication). [The biggest threat
to such power is **interruption of communicatio**]{.underline}**n**. Any
system breakdown is a function of stress. The fundamentals of this
technology can be condensed into the metaphor C3 I,
command-control-communicationintelligence, the military\'s symbol for
its operations theory.

### L -- Dualisms

#### Drawing dualisms between the "[natural]{.underline}" and the "[robotic]{.underline}", the "[flawed]{.underline}" vs the "[perfect]{.underline}", and the "[self]{.underline}" vs the "[controlled]{.underline}" solely work to reproduce women under [masculine autonomy]{.underline} and enable [domination]{.underline} of the [Other]{.underline}

**Haraway 85** (Donna Haraway - American Professor Emerita in the
History of Consciousness Department and Feminist Studies Department at
the University of California, "A Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science,
Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980s", Australian Feminism
Studies, Pages 32-34, 1985, MG)

[This is not just literary deconstruction, but liminal transformation.
Every story that begins with original innocence and privileges the
return to wholeness imagines the drama of life to be individuation,
separation, the birth of the self, the tragedy of autonomy, the fall
into writing, alienation; i.e., war, tempered by imaginary respite in
the bosom of the Other. These plots are ruled by a **reproductive
politics** --- rebirth without flaw, **perfection**, abstraction. In
this plot women are imagined either better or worse off, but all agree
they have **less selfhood, weaker individuation, more fusion to the
oral**]{.underline}**,** to Mother, **[less at stake in masculine
autonomy]{.underline}**. But there is another route to having less at
stake in masculine autonomy, a route that does not pass through Woman,
Primitive, Zero, the Mirror Stage and its imaginary. It passes through
women and other present-tense, [illegitimate cyborgs, not of Woman born,
who refuse the ideological resources of victimization so as to have a
real life. These cyborgs are the people who refuse to disappear on cue,
no matter how many times a \'Western\' commentator remarks on **the sad
passing of another primitive, another organic group done in by
\'Western\' technology**]{.underline}, by writing.33 These real-life
cyborgs, e.g., the Southeast Asian village women workers in Japanese and
U.S. electronics firms described by Aiwa Ong, are actively rewriting the
texts of their bodies and societies. **[Survival is the
stakes]{.underline}** in this play of readings. \*

To recapitulate, [certain dualisms have been persistent in Western
traditions; they have all been systemic to the logics and practices of
**domination of women, people of colour, nature, workers,
animals**]{.underline} --- in short, domination of all constituted as
others, whose task is to mirror the self. [Chief among these troubling
dualisms are]{.underline} self/other, [mind/body, **culture/nature**,
male/female, **civilized/primitive**]{.underline}, reality/ appearance,
whole/part, agent/resource, maker/made, active/ passive, right/wrong,
truth/illusion, total/partial, God/man. The self is the One who is not
dominated, who knows that by the service of the other; the other is the
one who holds the future, who knows that by the experience of
domination, which gives the lie to the autonomy of the self. To be One
is to be autonomous, to be powerful, to be God; but to be One is to be
an illusion, and so to be involved in a dialectic of apocalypse with the
other. Yet to be other is to be multiple, without clear boundary,
frayed, insubstantial. One is too few, but two are too many.

[High-tech culture challenges these dualisms in intriguing ways. It is
not clear who makes and who is made in the relation between human and
machine. It is not clear what is mind and what body in machines that
resolve into coding practices. Insofar as we know ourselves in both
formal discourse (e.g., biology) and in daily practice (e.g., the
homework economy in the integrated circuit), we find ourselves to be
**cyborgs, hybrids, mosaics, chimeras**. Biological organisms have
become biotic systems, communications devices like others. There is no
fundamental, ontological separation in our formal knowledge of machine
and organism, of technical and organic.]{.underline}

[One consequence is that our sense of **connection to our tools is
heightened**.]{.underline} The trance state experienced by many computer
users has become a staple of science-fiction film and cultural jokes.
Perhaps paraplegics and other severely handicapped people can (and
sometimes do) have the most intense experiences of complex hybridization
with other communication devices. Anne McCaffrey\'s The Ship Who Sang
explored the consciousness of a cyborg, hybrid of girl\'s brain and
complex machinery, formed after the birth of a severely handicapped
child. Gender, sexuality, embodiment, skill: all were reconstituted in
the story. Why should our bodies end at the skin, or include at best
other beings encapsulated by skin? From the seventeenth century till
now, machines could be animated --- given ghostly souls to make them
speak or move or to account for their orderly development and mental
capacities. [Or organisms could be mechanized --- reduced to body
understood as resource of mind. These machine/organism relationships are
obsolete, unnecessary. For us, in imagination and in other practice,
machines can be prosthetic devices, intimate components, friendly
selves. **We don\'t need organic holism** to give impermeable wholeness,
the total woman and her feminist variants (mutants?).]{.underline} Let
me conclude this point by a very partial reading of the logic of the
cyborg monsters of my second group of texts, feminist science fiction.

[The cyborgs populating feminist science fiction make very
**problematic** **the statuses of man or woman,** human, artifact,
member of a race, individual identity, or]{.underline}
[body]{.underline}. Katie King clarifies how pleasure in reading these
fictions is not largely based on identification. Students facing Joanna
Russ for the first time, students who have learned to take modernist
writers like James Joyce or Virginia Woolf without flinching, do not
know what to make of The Adventures of Alyx or The Female Man, where
characters refuse the reader\'s search for innocent wholeness while
granting the wish for heroic quests, exuberant eroticism, and serious
politics. The Female Man is the story of four versions of one genotype,
all of whom meet, but even taken together do not make a whole, resolve
the dilemmas of violent moral action, nor remove the growing scandal of
gender. The feminist science fiction of Samuel Delany, especially Tales
of Neveryon, mocks stories of origin by redoing the neolithic
revolution, replaying the founding moves of Western civilization to
subvert their plausibility. James Tiptree, Jr., an author whose fiction
was regarded as particularly manly until her \'true\' gender was
revealed, [tells tales of reproduction based on non-mammalian
technologies like alternation of generations or male brood pouches and
male nurturing]{.underline}. John Varley constructs a supreme cyborg in
his archfeminist exploration of Gaea, a mad goddess-planet-trickster-old
woman-technological device on whose surface an extraordinary array of
post-cyborg symbioses are spawned. Octavia Butler writes of an African
sorceress pitting her powers of transformation against the genetic
manipulations of her rival {Wild Seed), of time warps that bring a
modern U.S. black woman into slavery where her actions in relation to
her white master-ancestor determine the possibility of her own birth
(Kindred), and of the illegitimate insights into identity and community
of an adopted cross-species child who came to know the enemy as self
(Survivor).

### 2NC\-\--AT: Permutation

#### The perm fails -- it's imperialist and totalizes feminist analysis -- inclusion of the affirmative saves oppression, while the alt intentionally loses out on it

**Haraway 85** (Donna Haraway - American Professor Emerita in the
History of Consciousness Department and Feminist Studies Department at
the University of California, "A Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science,
Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980s", Australian Feminism
Studies, Pages 26-28, 1985, MG)

[The only way to characterize the informatics of domination is as a
massive intensification of insecurity and cultural impoverishment, with
common failure of subsistence networks for the most
vulnerable.]{.underline} Since much of this picture interweaves with the
social relations of science and technology[, the urgency of a
socialist-feminist politics addressed to science and technology is
**plain**]{.underline}. There is much now being done, and the grounds
for political work are rich. For example, the efforts to develop forms
of collective struggle for women in paid work, like SEIU\'s District
925, should be a high priority for all of us. These efforts are
profoundly tied to technical restructuring of labor processes and
reformations of working classes. These efforts also are providing
understanding of a more comprehensive kind of labor organization,
involving community, sexuality, and family issues never privileged in
the largely white male industrial unions.

[The structural rearrangements related to the social relations of
science and technology evoke strong ambivalence. But it is not necessary
to be ultimately depressed by the implications of latetwentieth-century
women\'s relation to all aspects of work, culture, production of
knowledge, sexuality, and reproduction. For]{.underline} excellent
reasons, most Marxisms see domination best and have trouble
understanding [what can only look like **false consciousness and
people\'s complicity** in their own domination in late capitalism. It is
crucial to remember that what is lost, perhaps especially from women\'s
points of view, is often **virulent forms of oppression**, nostalgically
naturalized in the face of current violation. Ambivalence toward the
disrupted unities mediated by high-tech culture requires **not sorting**
**consciousness** into categories of \'clear-sighted critique grounding
a solid political epistemology\' versus \'manipulated false
consciousness\', but subtle understanding of emerging pleasures,
experiences, and powers with serious potential for changing the rules of
the game.]{.underline}

There are grounds for hope in the emerging bases for new kinds of unity
across race, gender, and class, as these elementary units of
socialist-feminist analysis themselves suffer protean transformations.
Intensifications of hardship experienced worldwide in connection with
the social relations of science and technology are severe. But what
people are experiencing is not transparently clear, and we lack
sufficiently subtle connections for collectively building effective
theories of experience. [Present efforts --- Marxist, psychoanalytic,
feminist, anthropological --- to clarify even \'our\' experience are
**rudimentary**.]{.underline}

I am conscious of the odd perspective provided by my historical position
--- a Ph.D. in biology for an Irish Catholic girl was made possible by
Sputnik\'s impact on U.S. national science-education policy. I have a
body and mind as much constructed by the postWorld War II arms race and
cold war as by the women\'s movements. [There are more grounds for hope
by focusing on the contradictory effects of politics designed to produce
loyal American technocrats, which as well produced large numbers of
dissidents, rather than by focusing on the present defeats.]{.underline}

[The permanent partiality of feminist points of view has consequences
for our expectations of forms of political organization and
participation. **We do not need a totality in order to work well**. The
feminist dream of a common language, like all dreams for a perfectly
true language, of perfectly faithful naming of experience, **is a
totalizing and imperialist one**. In that sense, dialectics too is a
dream language, longing to resolve contradiction]{.underline}. Perhaps,
ironically, we can learn from our fusions with animals and machines how
not to be Man, the embodiment of Western logos. [From the point of view
of pleasure in these potent and taboo fusions, made inevitable by the
social relations of science and technology, there might indeed be a
feminist science.]{.underline}

## Silence K

### **1NC\-\--Shell**

#### We endorse subversive silence as a counter-act to their loud politics -- that's the only way to create a true aesthetic revolution

**Kaura-aho 21** (Katariina Kaura-aho - doctoral candidate in the
Faculty of Law at the University of Helsinki, "The aesthetics of
political resistance: On silent politics", Thesis Eleven 65, 2021,
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/07255136211035154>, MG)

[Silent protests, such as the two refugees' protest in Finland, can be
described as expressions of a certain kind of **political 'spirit'**.
This spirit can be defined in many ways. It can be named, for example,
the spirit of autonomy, the spirit of freedom or the spirit of
equality.]{.underline} In On Revolution (1963), Hannah Arendt discusses
the idea of the revolutionary spirit, which is the spirit of actualising
something new politically. In Arendtian theory, this spirit appears as
the urge and courage for miraculous political action that initiates
something new in the world (Arendt, 1958, 1963).

[An alternative way of describing the spirit of politics would be to
call it a '**revolting spirit'**. This definition would perhaps capture
something of the Zapatista conception of political refusal as an
expression of that something that in us intuitively says **no to
domination**]{.underline} (Holloway and Pel´aez, 1998: 184--5).
[Expressions of a revolting spirit can be politically
meaningful.]{.underline} We must here argue against, for example, Slavoj
Zizek, who attacks as a basic weakness of many contemporary political
protests the fact that they remain mere expressions of rage and, as
such, cannot result in positive programs of socio-political change. The
problem, Zizek argues, is that ['(t)hey express a spirit of revolt
without revolution' (Zizek, 2012: 78). As the spirit of political
subversion, however, and of the active representation of autonomous
definitions of the world, the revolting spirit can be politically
meaningful. This spirit can materialise in acts of resistance that
powerfully bring into view the oppressiveness of the prevailing
aesthetic political order and point toward the possibility of realising
a more egalitarian one.]{.underline} The revolting spirit can thus
indeed be just another name for the revolutionary spirit: the spirit of
actualising something new politically. Refugee protests are examples of
the emergence of the revolting, revolutionary spirit in contemporary
political contexts.

Refugee protests expressing this spirit undermine the aesthetic
sensibility of prevailing aesthetic refugee regimes. The persistent
reoccurrence of protests led by this spirit holds the potential for
bringing about continual aesthetic revolutions in the sensibility of law
and politics.

[Especially silent protests can initiate such **aesthetic revolutions**.
Against the backdrop of what could be described as frameworks of **loud
representative vocalisation** and the noise pollution of statist
rhetoric, they emerge as a radical, subversive form of political
communication. The refugees' protest in Finland, for example, as a
verbally silent, **embodied act of political communication**, appeared
as a potentially subversive act. In the statist context of
citizen-centred politics and a representative speech system privileging
loud extrovert modes of verbal speech, its silent reaching out had a
**special quieting effect**.]{.underline}

[Silent protest acts by politically marginalised people can sometimes
succeed in making their audience speechless as well. A silent act can
cause a pause in the midst of a loud message-filled reality and it can
be experienced as something meaningful. In these moments of silence, the
logic of prevailing **aesthetic orders of politics can be sensed anew**.
When many such silences take place simultaneously, a broader, common
subversion in the aesthetic orders can start to evolve. The silent
political act that brought about these many silences can then be
understood as an aesthetically revolutionary act.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Solves

#### It's [aesthetic]{.underline} and they exclude [refugees]{.underline} from their method otherwise

**Kaura-aho 21** (Katariina Kaura-aho - doctoral candidate in the
Faculty of Law at the University of Helsinki, "The aesthetics of
political resistance: On silent politics", Thesis Eleven 65, 2021,
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/07255136211035154>, MG)

[The refugees' protest evokes many pressing political questions calling
for theoretical analysis. One key question the protest evokes is to what
extent the human right to sexuality is in practice recognised as a
ground for asylum and protected in contemporary political]{.underline}
contexts (see, for example, Spijkerboer, 2013).2 In this article,
however, I will not focus on the question of the right to sexuality as
such, but specifically on the mode of the political action through which
the refugees resisted their denial of this right. In the article, I
focus especially on the silent character of the refugees' protest.

[The central problem the article attempts to address is the
**marginalisation of refugees from political speech** in contemporary
liberal, statist political contexts. Refugees often **cannot participate
in verbal political speech** in a way that their speech would be
recognised as politically meaningful in these contexts (see Arendt,
1951). In frameworks where verbal political speech has been mainly
privatised to citizen subjects, often the only possibility for refugees
to communicate politically is through acts of resistance. Such acts can
convey the political messages that would otherwise remain unheard and
unrecognised in statist settings. One mode in which refugees' acts of
resistance can then emerge is **silent resistance**. In silent
resistance, silence speaks or **enables the body to speak in visually
strong ways.**]{.underline}

In the article, by applying radical democratic theory as well as
somewhat phenomenological insights, I analyse how [silent resistance can
be a politically emancipatory mode of politics for refugees as well as,
more generally, a **politically subversive mode of political action** in
prevailing 'Western', liberal, statist political contexts of
representative democracy. I interpret how silent refugee
protests]{.underline}, such as the two refugees' protest in Finland,
[can disrupt the prevailing logic and 'sense' of politics and instead
introduce an **alternative sensibility on politics** and common life.
The subversive effect that silent resistance can have, I argue, can be
understood as an **aesthetic effect**. I analyse silent resistance from
this aesthetic perspective. By focusing on the aesthetic, politically
subversive potential in silent refugee activism]{.underline}, my attempt
is to introduce a new perspective for theoretical discussions on refugee
politics.

### L -- Cybernationalism

#### The will to technology came to pass as a digital "scramble for Africa" -- sadly for them, Black bodies were able to win the race through the utilization of said will and create African unity and Diasporic Cybernationalism. Now, they want to dismantle the will to technology because they lost the race, isn't that crazy?

Geopolitics in the Digital Age

[The hyperbolic rhetoric designating the Internet and the World Wide Web
as "super information highways" and as the gateway or on-ramp to the
information age did not go unnoticed by the African diasporic
community]{.underline}. While some remained skeptical of the discursive
onslaught of utopic claims for the revolutionary digital democracy,
[many were affected by the **gold rush mentality** that seems to have
triggered a bout of global **cyberfever**. It is important to understand
that the current scramble for domination and domestication of the
Internet and the World Wide Web is not unlike that unleashed on the
African continent by the West in the nineteenth century. This "scramble
for Africa" analogy as a narrative frame for contextualizing the stakes
involved in the Internet revolution was dually inspired. One inspiration
was the spate of newspaper articles covering the speed with which
African Americans were entering the fast lanes of the global infobahn
discussed earlier]{.underline}. Another suggested itself as news
surfaced of the global media corporations' scramble to colonize the
Internet through their highly publicized strategies of merger mania and
media convergence rhetoric. And while print reports detailing an
unanticipated surge in black on-line connectivity only hint at what any
netizen (virtual citizen of the Internet) or Net novice today who types
in the keywords "black" and "African" as any portion of a keyword search
quickly discovers: these search commands yield hundreds to hundreds of
thousands of "results," "hits," or "category matches" (in the argot of
Internet search engines Lycos, Yahoo, and many others). This study
reveals that [since 1991, black people throughout the African diaspora
have mounted their **own scramble for a secure share** of the Internet
spoils in the intensifying **global grab for Internet
dominance**.]{.underline}

As one of history's most profound and far-reaching cycles of corporate
expansion and domination since the industrial age's robber barons and
corporate trusts, [today's megamedia mergers threaten to obliterate any
remaining optimism about preserving the last vestiges of a viable and
unsponsored public sphere.12 Indeed, the political engine of
deregulation responsible for powering the economic force of the
ascendant global media behemoths has the capacity and intent now to
**rock our worlds**]{.underline}. No sooner had the centripetal forces
of technological innovation produced newer, democratizing models of mass
media diversity such as cable, satellite, Internet, wireless, and other
wide-ranging digital communications systems, than the older media
concerns set in motion a centrifugal countermodel of mass media
monopolizing and reconsolidation, better known as convergence. Because
these newer media were poised to undermine what Ben Bagdikian calls the
media monopoly, many believed [the decentralized nature and
transnational reach of these new media industries signaled a new age of
participatory democracy and by extension progressive social equity and
creative cultural rejuvenation. It seemed that finally new multimedia
forms might function to serve and **promote the diverse communicative
needs of a changing, multicultural world.** The arrival and rapid
diffusion of the Internet and the World Wide Web were central to this
vision of inevitable global transformation, as the Internet's role in
prodemocracy movements in several developing nations
attest]{.underline}. One contemporary critic, who underscores the
connection between the Internet and geopolitical change, is Ingrid
Volkmer. In Volkmer's estimation:

[the Internet can be regarded as an icon of a globalized media world
that has **shifted global communication to a new level**]{.underline}.
Whereas television was a harbinger of this new era of global
communication by reaching a worldwide audience with worldwide
distribution and innovative global programming (such as that of CNN and
MTV), the Internet reveals the full vision of a global community. . . .
the implications are obvious: [national borders are increasingly
**disappearing** within cyberspace. (1997, 48)]{.underline}

[Not only do national borders increasingly disappear in cyberspace, they
are replaced by new kinship structures now predicated on the **fluidity
of cybernetic virtual communities and homelands**.]{.underline}

In his influential work Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin
and Spread of Nationalism, Benedict Anderson (1993) reminds us that
"[nationality, or . . . \[the\] world's multiple significations,
nation-ness, as well as nationalism, are cultural artifacts of a
particular kind" (4). It is essential to Anderson that we understand how
"nation-ness" is often historically determined and its meanings subject
to change over time (4).]{.underline} And yet for Anderson it is crucial
to recognize the profound emotional legitimacy of nationalisms despite
the challenge of subnationalisms within many tenuous nationalist
borders, as the recent dissolution of the Soviet Union, the fall of the
Berlin Wall, and the bloody coups responsible for reconfiguring many
"Third World" nations clearly attest. "Nation, nationality,
nationalism," as Anderson points out, "all have proved notoriously
difficult to define, let alone analyse" (3). Clearly then, [the
historical changes and technological innovations responsible for the
Internet threaten to exacerbate the slippery and increasingly fragile
traditional nationalisms while simultaneously strengthening the
affective dimensions of a newer virtual or cybernationalism now unbound
by traditional ideological, political, economic, geographical, and even
temporal boundaries and limitations]{.underline}. Moreover, we must now
work to proffer new definitions and analyses of [these **new brands of
African diasporic cybernationalisms** as they existed in the early years
of the Internet's global formation.]{.underline}

[As early as 1992 the African diaspora was willfully and optimistically
dispersed into the transnational ether of the Internet by many
tech-savvy African nationals and expatriates living and working abroad.
For these black geeks the **lure of cyberspace represents "the
possibility of vast, unexplored territory**" (Balsamo 1996, 116) capable
of sustaining **new modes of postcolonial African unity,** of sorts,
often untenable on the continent given the political and military
economies of "real" space. Among African early adopters of the Internet
and the World Wide Web were those visionary tech-evangelists---or
cyberwitchdoctors, if you will---who conjured such new Africanities
on-line as Naijanet]{.underline}, the Association of Nigerians Abroad,
the Buganda Home Page, the African National Congress Home Page, and
others. By 1997 more black diasporic Web sites began appearing,
including ones for the Republic of Ghana, the AfroCaribbean Chamber of
Commerce, Camden (UK) Black Parents' and Teachers' Association, Canadian
Artists' Network: Black Artists In Action, Egypt's Information Highway
Project, and Africa Online, among others too numerous to consider here.

#### "Debate-as-potlatch" is [meaningless]{.underline} and devolves into a [forensic reenactment of bygone revolutions]{.underline} that takes flaunting the rules as an [endpoint]{.underline} and becomes [complacent]{.underline} in the [same sterilizing practices they criticize]{.underline}. Our framework doesn't mold debaters in any particular way---it breeds the skills to make [trained]{.underline} and [tested actions]{.underline} through a ritualized policy debate-game that [looks a lot like a potlatch]{.underline}!

**Snider, 3**---former director of debate at the University of Vermont
(Alfred, "Paris Nocturne," CAD 24 (2003): 16-101)

First, [[Schnurer]{.mark} offers]{.underline} what appears to me to be
[a **major contradiction**. He **savages the game concept**. He then
[introduces]{.mark} us to the game of "**[Potlatch]{.mark}**," and sings
its praises [as a way to **tear down consumerist society** and]{.mark}
as a model [for **inspiring exchange of ideas**]{.mark}]{.underline}. He
finishes with an exhortation to "find games that fulfill our
revolutionary potential, take whatever moments we can for ourselves to
try and push for as much change as we possibly can." [**[How "Potlatch"
avoids his]{.mark} earlier [criticisms]{.mark}** or how his search for
"game to fulfill our revolutionary potential" can avoid them [is **not
explained**. He]{.mark} **simply [cannot have it both ways]{.mark}**
[absent]{.mark} a **[substantial explanation]{.mark}** of how this
contradiction is bridged]{.underline}.

Second, I believe that [[Schnurer]{.mark} **misunderstands**
the]{.underline} concept of "[paradigm]{.underline}" as used in these
discussions. [He [states]{.mark}]{.underline} that debate "paradigms are
boundaries drawn to include and exclude certain types of behavior. At
their most mundane, [[debate paradigms **establish**]{.mark} **the
'[rules']{.mark}** [that **encircle the activity**]{.mark} of
debating]{.underline}." [[He offers **no supporting
documentation**]{.mark} for this claim]{.underline}. Thomas Kuhn (1962,
p. viii) has noted that [[paradigms **set the stage** for discussions,
but are **not controlling**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in that [[they are
"**sufficiently open-ended** to leave **all sorts of problems**]{.mark}
for the redefined practitioners to solve."]{.underline} I have found the
work of Masterman (1970, p. 68) to be very useful. She notes that there
are three sorts of paradigms, being philosophical, sociological, and
construct paradigms. A debate paradigm would seem to be a construct
paradigm. The construct paradigm is an instrument or tool for learning.
The focus is what a paradigm can do to guide our actions (p. 71). A
construct paradigm is a "way of seeing" and helps guide us in how we
understand a given situation or organize a set of data. She sees the
Kuhnian construct paradigm as a starting point or "research vehicle" (p.
78). It is a beginning for theory, an analogy we can employ in
understanding a process such as academic debate. It is not an iron set
of rules, but a perspective. A paradigm is a beginning for theory, an
analogy we can employ in understanding a process such as academic
debate. [These understandings are **quite different** from those of
Schnurer]{.underline}.

Third, [[Schnurer seems to **glorify** the **flaunting**]{.mark} and
**breaking [of rules]{.mark}**. He wants to "agitate the gamers, and
push them to look beyond the game and consider breaking even the most
solid rules." He longs for a world and a debate activity **more like the
revolution in Paris of May 1968** than a standard debate tournament. It
is clear that [in debate the "rules" (**about which there can be no
argument**) are few, including]{.mark} **the time limits**, **[the
wording of the topic]{.mark}**, and **the identity of the speakers**.
**[Which]{.mark} of these rules [would he have us throw aside]{.mark}**?
All of the rest resides in the world of "**procedures**," **common
practices** that are **still open for debate** and
**disputation**]{.underline}.

[[The "rules]{.mark}" of debate [are **not so constricting**]{.mark},
and the relevance of procedures]{.underline} (common understandings that
can be challenged at any time, such as the role of the topic in the
debate) [teaches students to **question major guidelines**, **not to
obey them \[unquestioningly\]**]{.underline} ~~blindly~~. [I would
defend a game with **limited rules** and **debatable procedures**,
**not** an activity in which **all rules** should be **boldly
disregarded** and **violated**]{.underline}. Just as Schnurer probably
has limits to what is acceptable in his classroom, **[there should be
some limits in a debate]{.underline}**.

Fourth, [[Schnurer seems **fascinated** by]{.mark} the]{.underline}
strategies and approaches of the Situationists embodied in the
["revolution" that took place in Paris in May 1968. I find this to be an
**entertaining** and **romantic vision**, but **not necessarily a valid
one**. If [Paris in May]{.mark} 19[68]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is his
"paradigm" for]{.mark} revolutionary potential in [debate]{.mark}, I am
not a supporter.]{.underline}

[[This]{.mark} sort of revolution [is **neither "real" nor productive**
and is **guilty of many of the same errors that Schnurer attaches to
"debating**]{.mark}**"** as opposed to "acting."]{.underline} Dirk Jan
van Baar (1998) wrote:

[[May]{.mark}, 19[68]{.mark} [was **not a "real" revolution**. The
students "**played**" revolution.]{.mark} It was the **last attempt** of
Paris to justify itself as the '**revolutionary centre**' of the world.
But [the French were **lagging behind**]{.mark}, [the 'counter-culture'
**commercialized**]{.mark} and **globalized**, [and were **not**
]{.mark}**really [interested]{.mark}** [in leftist ideology. Playing the
revolution was **fun**, **not serious stuff**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
generation of 1968 contributed --- contrary to its own aims --- to the
further Americanization of Europe (France). [Today\'s revolutions that
**really matter**]{.underline} --- such as [the imaginative
revolutions]{.underline} in Information Technology --- [are **more
virtual**, and **can do without Paris**.]{.underline}

[[It is **not the "riots in Paris**]{.mark}, with upended cars" [that
have the **most real impact for change**, but]{.mark} the "virtual"
[revolutions]{.mark} that take place **[inside the minds]{.mark} of
individuals**, [something that **happens regularly through debate
participation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Fifth, [[Schnurer **ignores the realities that can emerge** from]{.mark}
**what we do here on [the "playing fields]{.mark} of
earth."**]{.underline} It seems clear to me that [[**real social
change** comes from **skilled**, **thoughtful**, and **practiced human
agents**.]{.mark} **Student [debaters do not hover endlessly in]{.mark}
the game of [debate]{.mark}**[. They]{.mark} **graduate** and **[move
on]{.mark}** to lives and careers **outside of the game**. [Yet, they
**take with them**]{.mark} **the [skills]{.mark} they have learned**. By
demanding that the game of debate **also become direct action**,
Schnurer **denies them** the **training in a safe place** that can
**facilitate later success**.]{.underline}

Sixth, ["[Potlatch" may have **more in common with**]{.mark} **the game
of [debate than Schnurer realizes]{.mark}**. The game of debate is a
process by which participants **offer their lofty ideas**, **goals**,
and **proposals** for **exchange** and **mutual analysis**.]{.underline}
Borrowing the rhetoric of Hussey used by Schnurer, [academic [debate
is]{.mark} also [a "**living moment of poetry**" that "**breaks down**
and **reverses conventional**]{.mark} **chronological
[patterns]{.mark}**." Academic [debate **offers arguments** as
"**gifts**]{.mark}," **often lofty** and **sometimes utopian**.
[These]{.mark} gifts [**can easily be seen** as a "**catalyst of the
future** in the form of a **crystallization of
desire**]{.mark}."]{.underline} The rhetoric of Debord also makes this
point, that [[the game "is **able to distribute**" our "**novel
desires**]{.mark} and **problems**" [and creates a process where "**only
the further elaboration of these by others can constitute the
corresponding return gift**]{.mark}.]{.underline}" Both Hussey and
Debord are describing "[[Potlatch]{.underline}]{.mark}," but it
[[seems]{.underline}]{.mark} to me to be **[[very much like]{.mark} the
game of [debate]{.mark}]{.underline}** I have been describing for over
twenty years.

Maxwell Schnurer is a gifted, insightful, and inspiring debate
professional. His thesis, however, that gaming as a concept strips
debating of its revolutionary potential, is incomplete. [The game of
[debate is a **training ground** for **future action**]{.mark} **for
social change**, [**first** and **foremost**]{.mark}. His
[vision]{.mark} of a revolutionary debate [where **all rules are
gleefully violated** in a **forensic reenactment of Paris**]{.mark} in
May, 1968 [would **damage the ultimate potential** debate]{.mark}
training [has]{.mark} for **real citizenship**, **social evolution** and
**change**. We need **trained** and **tested actions** and
**decisions**, **not spontaneous revolution**.]{.underline}

### at: ssd bad

#### switch-side debate is good and any alternative links worse to their criticism of debate

**Stannard 2006** -- Director of Forensics and Associate Lecturer in the
Department of Communication and Journalism at the University of Wyoming
(4/18, Matt, The Underview, Spring 2006 Faculty Senate Speaker Series
Speech, "Deliberation, Debate, and Democracy in the Academy and Beyond",
http://theunderview.blogspot.com/2006/04/deliberation-democracy-and-debate.html,
3NR)

If it is indeed true that debate inevitably produces other-oriented
deliberative discourse at the expense of students\' confidence in their
first-order convictions, this would indeed be a trade-off worth
criticizing. In all fairness, Hicks and Greene do not overclaim their
critique, and they take care to acknowledge the important ethical and
cognitive virtues of deliberative debating. When represented as anything
other than a political-ethical concern, however, Hicks and Greene\'s
critique has several problems: First, as my colleague J.P. Lacy recently
pointed out, it seems a tremendous causal (or even rhetorical) stretch
to go from \"debating both sides of an issue creates civic
responsibility essential to liberal democracy\" to \"this civic
responsibility upholds the worst forms of American exceptionalism.\"
Second, Hicks and Greene do not make any comparison of the potentially
bad power of debate to any alternative. Their implied alternative,
however, is a form of forensic speech that privileges personal
conviction. The idea that students should be able to preserve their
personal convictions at all costs seems far more immediately tyrannical,
far more immediately damaging to either liberal or participatory
democracy, than the ritualized requirements that students occasionally
take the opposite side of what they believe. Third, as I have suggested
and will continue to suggest, while a debate project requiring
participants to understand and often \"speak for\" opposing points of
view may carry a great deal of liberal baggage, it is at its core a
project more ethically deliberative than institutionally liberal. Where
Hicks and Greene see debate producing \"the liberal citizen-subject,\"
[I see debate at least having the potential to produce \"the
deliberative human being.\" [The fact that some]{.mark} academic
[debaters are recruited by]{.mark} the [CSIS and the CIA does not
undermine this thesis. Absent]{.mark} healthy [debate]{.mark} programs[,
these think-tanks]{.mark} and government agencies [would still
recruit]{.mark} what they saw as the best and brightest students. [And
absent a debate community that rewards anti-institutional]{.mark}
political [rhetoric as much as liberal rhetoric, those students would
have little]{.mark}-to-no [chance of being exposed to]{.mark} truly
[oppositional ideas.]{.mark} Moreover, if we allow ourselves to believe
that it is \"culturally imperialist\" to help other peoples build
institutions of debate and deliberation, we not only ignore living
political struggles that occur in every culture, but we fall victim to a
dangerous ethnocentrism in holding that \"they do not value deliberation
like we do.\" If the argument is that our participation in fostering
debate communities abroad greases the wheels of globalization, the
correct response, in debate terminology, is that such [globalization is
non-unique, inevitable, and there is only a risk that
collaborating]{.mark} across cultures in public debate and deliberation
will [foster resistance to domination]{.mark}---just as debate
accomplishes wherever it goes]{.underline}. Indeed, Andy Wallace, in a
recent article, suggests that Islamic fundamentalism is a byproduct of
the colonization of the lifeworld of the Middle East; if this is true,
then one solution would be to foster cross-cultural deliberation among
people on both sides of the cultural divide willing to question their
own preconceptions of the social good. [Hicks and Greene might be
correct insofar as elites in various cultures can either forbid or
reappropriate deliberation, but for those outside of that institutional
power, democratic discussion would have a positively subversive
effect]{.underline}.

We can read such criticisms in two ways. The first way is as a warning:
That we ought to remain cautious of how academic debate will be
represented and deployed outside of the academy, in the ruthless
political realm, by those who use it to dodge truthful assertions, by
underrepresented groups, of instances of material injustice. In this
sense, the fear is one of a "legalistic" evasion of substantive
injustice by those privileging procedure over substance, a trained style
over the primordial truth of marginalized groups.

I prefer that interpretation to the second one: That the switch-side,
research-driven "game" of debate is politically bankrupt and should give
way to several simultaneous zones of speech [activism, [where]{.mark}
[speakers]{.mark}]{.underline} can and should [[only fight for their own
beliefs]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Gordon Mitchell has pointed out, [such
balkanized [speech will break down into several enclaves of speaking,
each with its own political criteria for entry]{.mark}. In such a
collection]{.underline} of impassable and unpermeable communities,
[those power relations, those material power entities, that evade
political speech will remain unaccountable, will be given a "free pass"
by [the]{.mark} speech [community]{.mark}, who will be so [wrapped up in
their own micropolitics]{.mark}, or so [busy preaching to]{.mark}
themselves and [their choirs, that they will never understand or
confront the rhetorical tropes used to mobilize]{.mark} both resources
and true believers in the service of continued material
[domination]{.mark}]{.underline}. Habermas's defense of the unfinished
Enlightenment is my defense of academic debate: Don't throw the baby out
with the bathwater. Instead, seek to expand this method of deliberation
to those who will use it to liberate themselves, confront power, and
create ethical, nonviolent patterns of problem resolution. If capitalism
corrupts debate, well, then I say we save debate.

[In generative grammar the set of such highly abstract principles is
called Universal grammar]{.underline}. [The nature of this grammar which
is the reality of language is not given but is to be
hypostatized]{.underline}. [Its reality is the fact that speakers have
an internal knowledge about it although they are unable to externalize
that knowledge. In this sense, then, language as it is known exists only
as an epiphenomenon]{.underline}, as used by Chomsky. [From such a
perspective, it is easy to see how **[grammar is the real thing and
language an appearance]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Thus, what is called as
[[grammar]{.underline}]{.mark} in this abstract sense [[is]{.mark} to be
seen as [a set of boundary conditions under which language becomes
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. Within the boundaries however various
further possibilities exist, giving rise to a whole range of
multiplicities and variations. Internal choices are also responsible for
language change in course of time[. [Languages]{.mark} [change because
of many factors]{.mark}]{.underline}, sometimes accidentally but often
due to contact situations. [This is not denied when it is said that
'grammar' is a priori; for whatever roles these forces play, they do not
change the basic shape of language]{.underline}. Grammar is also the
pursuit of an activity as much the way Collingwood says what art is. In
trying to arrive at an understanding of any activity, one must begin
with a mass of experience related to that activity; and this experience
cannot be acquired by philosophical thinking, or by scientific
experiments, or by observation of the activity in other people, but only
by a long and specialized pursuit of activity itself. Only after this
experience has been acquired is it possible to reflect upon it and to
bring to light the principles underlying it (Collingwood, 1925, pp.
8-9). From this it is clear, that one cannot reflect on grammar without
actually doing grammar. These remarks of Collingwood, made in respect of
the philosophy of art, underscore the importance of doing something well
before venturing to talk about it, and that applies to the field of
grammar without doubt. It is liked to be said by us that doing grammar
and thinking about it are simultaneous and mutually supportive
activities. In the end of history, does each speaker decide his or her
own grammar? Many people believe that that is how it is going to be. If
so then grammar gradually loses its authenticity and we will have only a
naïve theory of language. But grammar has been continuously resisting
that end, and in that resistance, history too may have some hopes of
survival! 4. Different perspectives on competence According to Chomsky,
Linguistic theory is concerned primarily with an ideal speaker-listener,
in a completely homogeneous speech community, who knows language
perfectly and is unaffected by such grammatically irrelevant conditions
as memory limitations, distractions, shifts of attention and interest,
errors (random or characteristic) in applying his knowledge of the
language in actual performance (Chomsky, 1965, p. 3). Chomsky clearly
distinguished the description of language form (competence) and language
use (performance) and established that the speaker-listener's internal
grammar that judges the grammaticality of sentences should be the main
object of investigation for linguists. ￼100 Consortia Academia
Publishing According to Dell Hymes communicative competence is
"appropriateness of sociocultural significance of utterance" (Canale &
Swain, 1980). Hymes (1974), retaining the idea of Chomsky's underlying
grammatical competence, looks at contextual relevance as one of the
crucial aspects of one's knowledge of language and claims that meaning
in communication is determined by its speech community and actual
communicative event in question, which consists of the following
components he calls SPEAKING (a mnemonic code word): Setting,
Participants, Ends, Act sequence, Key, Instrumentalities, Norms of
interaction and interpretation and Genre (Hymes, 1974). These are
broadly considered speech contexts in which real verbal interactions
takes place. 5. Conclusion From what has been read before it is realized
that without rules there is chaos. [Grammar is merely a set of rules to
preserve the written word]{.underline}. Without these standards there
would be no continuity of language and over time communication of ideas
would suffer. As people from different parts of the world try to talk in
English which is influenced by their own mother tongue, there are errors
in grammar and sentence pattern. [If one can master grammar, He or She
can unlock ideas and thoughts that were written across time and
place.]{.underline} [Proper grammar is very important. [Correct grammar
keeps from being misunderstood and lets us effectively express our
thoughts and ideas.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The way we
communicate]{.mark} is [extremely important]{.mark} in our profession
and society]{.underline}. While modern technology and social media have
less formal forms of communication, [we are expected to produce perfect
grammar in professional settings]{.underline}. Glaring errors in
spellings and punctuation are judged before the content of the work.
Grammar gives language users the control of expression and communication
in everyday life[. [Mastery over the words help]{.mark} speakers
[communicate]{.mark} their [emotions and purpose more
effectively]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even though changes in grammar are
made from old to contemporary, grammar can change its shape according to
the trend but the importance or the role played by grammar still remains
the same]{.underline}.

### at: truth is violent

#### Making truth claims is inevitable, vital to solve either team's impacts, and unrelated to "imposing" truths violently

**Eagleton '3** \[Terry; 2003; Distinguished Professor of English
Literature at Lancaster University; *After Theory*, Basic Books: New
York, NY, p. 105-9\]

[If it is true that a situation is racist, then it is absolutely true.
It is not just my opinion, or yours]{.underline}. But of course it may
not be true. [Or it may be partially true - in which case it absolutely
is partially true, as opposed to being completely true or not true at
all. [Defenders of]{.mark} **absolute [truth]{.mark}** [are not]{.mark}
necessarily **[dogmatists]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In any case,
[dogmatism does just not mean thumping the table with one hand and
clutching your opponent by the throat with the other]{.underline}. It
means refusing to give grounds for your beliefs, appealing instead
simply to authority. [There are plenty of courteous, soft-spoken
dogmatists]{.underline}. [[Holding something]{.mark} to be [absolutely
true does not mean]{.mark} affirming it against all conceivable evidence
and argument, and **[refusing]{.mark}** in any circumstances [to]{.mark}
[**concede**]{.mark} that [you are **mistaken**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[Those who believe in absolute truth may]{.underline}]{.mark} [well
[be]{.mark} the kind of people who are [pathologically cautious about
**accepting anything as true**]{.mark} unless it seems **plainly
undeniable**]{.underline}. They may stumble through life in a haze of
scepticism and a miasma of doubt. [It is just]{.underline} that [when
they do]{.underline}, **[perhaps once every decade or so]{.underline}**,
[come grudgingly to accept a proposition such as 'The head gardener has
just shot himself through the foot' as true, they recognize that its
opposite cannot also be true]{.underline}, [and that its **being true
for them means** its being **true for everyone else as
well**.]{.underline} [Nor does 'absolutely true' mean true independently
of any context. We can only judge the world from within some kind of
framework]{.underline}. But this does not necessarily mean that what is
true from one viewpoint is false from another. [Elephants may be sacred
for you but not for me, if this represents a difference between our ways
of signifying them]{.underline}. **[But it cannot be true that elephants
really are sacred,]{.underline}** [in the same way that they really have
four legs]{.underline}, and that they are in the same sense not sacred.
[Cultures make sense of the world in different ways]{.underline}, [and
what some see as a fact others do not]{.underline}; **[but if truth
simply means truth-for-us]{.underline}**, **[then there can be no
conflict between us and other cultures]{.underline}**, since truth is
equally just truth-for-them. [This is tolerable enough when it comes to
the sacred status of elephants, as well as being extremely convenient
for us if we hold that forcing sexual relations on toddlers contributes
to their emotional well-being and psychological stability in later
years, and the culture next door does not]{.underline}. Since their view
is entirely relative to their own way of life, [it can naturally have no
effect on our behaviour.]{.underline} In any case, [if each cultural
framework constructs the world differently enough, it is hard to see how
they could share the same proposition in common. A different world
yields a different meaning. **Absolute truth has nothing to do with
fanaticism.**]{.underline} It does not necessarily mean the kind of
truth to which you are fervently committed. 'Erlangen is in Germany' is
absolutely true, but one would not go to one's death for it. [It is not
the kind of truth which sets the blood coursing and quickens the
heartbeat]{.underline}. **[It does not have the same emotional force as
'You strangled my great-aunt, you despicable bastard!]{.underline}**'
**[[Most absolute truths are pretty trivial]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Much
the same goes for the word 'absolute' when used in some moral discourse.
For Thomas Aquinas, '**[absolutely]{.underline}** wrong' [does not
necessarily mean '**very, very wrong'**]{.underline}. The word
'**[[absolute']{.mark} here [is not an
intensifier]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [It just means 'shouldn't
be done under any circumstances']{.underline}. Aquinas thought rather
strangely that lying was absolutely wrong, but not killing; but he did
not of course believe that lying was always more grievous an offence
than killing. Being of reasonable intelligence, he appreciated well
enough that lying is sometimes pretty harmless. It was just that for him
it was absolutely wrong. **[[Absolute truth is not]{.mark} truth
[removed from time]{.mark} and change]{.underline}**. Things that are
true at one time can cease to be true at another, or new truths can
emerge. [The claim that some truth is absolute is a claim about what it
means to call something true, not a denial that there are different
truths at different times]{.underline}. [Absolute truth does not mean
non-historical truth: it does not mean the kind of truths which drop
from the sky]{.underline}, [or which are vouchsafed to us by some bogus
prophet from Utah]{.underline}. On the contrary, [[they are]{.mark}
truths which are [discovered by **argument, evidence, experiment,
investigation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[A lot of what is taken
as]{.mark} (absolutely) [true]{.mark} at any given time [will]{.mark} no
doubt [turn out to be false]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[Most apparently
watertight scientific hypotheses have turned out to be full of
holes]{.underline}**. [Not everything which is considered to be true is
actually true. But it remains the case that it cannot just be raining
from my viewpoint.]{.underline} Why does any of this matter? It matters,
for one thing, because it belongs to our dignity as moderately rational
creatures to know the truth. And that includes knowing the truth about
truth. It is best not to be deceived if we can possibly help it. But it
also matters because a ludicrous bugbear has been made of the word
\'absolute\' in this context; and because if the relativist is right,
then truth is emptied of much of its value. As Bernard Williams points
out, **[relativism is really a way of explaining away
conflict]{.underline}**.2 [If you maintain that democracy means everyone
being allowed to vote, while I maintain it means that only those people
may vote who have passed a set of fiendishly complicated intelligence
tests]{.underline}, [there]{.underline} [will always be **a liberal on
hand to claim that we are both right from our different points of
view**]{.underline}. [[If true loses its force]{.underline}, **[then
political radicals can stop talking]{.underline}** [as though it
is]{.underline} ]{.mark}[unequivocally [true that **women are
oppressed** or]{.mark} that [the **planet is being** ]{.mark}**gradually
[poisoned by corporate greed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They may still want
to insist that logic is a ruling-class conspiracy, but they cannot
logically expect anyone to believe them. The champions of Enlightenment
are right: truth indeed exists. But so are their counter-Enlightenment
critics: there is indeed truth, but it is monstrous.

### 2nc mcgee / support for creative tva

#### Debate is a game played by students who want to win. Debating about [utopian imaginaries]{.underline} of plans enacted by the USFG [effectively positions]{.underline} debaters and judges as [budding social critics]{.underline}---[without]{.underline} positioning debate as anything [more]{.underline} than a game. 

**McGee and Romanelli, 97**---Assistant Professor in Communication
Studies at Texas Tech AND Director of Debate at Loyola University of
Chicago (Brian and David, "Policy Debate as Fiction: In Defense of
Utopian Fiat," Contemporary Argumentation and Debate 18 (1997) 23-35,

Snider argued several years ago that [a suitable [paradigm should
address "something we can]{.mark} **ACTUALLY [DO]{.mark}**[" as opposed
to something we]{.mark} can **[MAKE BELIEVE
ABOUT]{.mark}**"]{.underline} ("Fantasy as Reality" 14[). [A
utopian]{.underline}]{.mark} literature [[metaphor is beneficial]{.mark}
**precisely [because it is within the power of debaters]{.mark}** [to
perform the]{.mark} desired [action]{.mark} suggested]{.underline} by
the metaphor, [[if not]{.mark} always to [demonstrate that the desired
action is **politically feasible**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Instead of [debaters]{.mark} playing to an audience of those who make
public policy, debaters [should understand themselves as]{.mark}
**budding [social critics]{.mark}** [in search of a]{.mark}n **optimal
[practical]{.mark}** and **cultural
[politics]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[While few of us will ever
hold a]{.mark} formal [policy-making position]{.mark}, nearly [all of us
grow up]{.mark} [with]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**social** and
**political [criticism]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the newspaper editorial
page, the high school civics class, and, at least in homes that do not
ban the juxtaposition of food and politics, the lively dinner table
conversation. [We complain about high income taxes, declining state
subsidies for public education, and crumbling interstate
highways]{.underline}. [We worry about the rising cost of health
care]{.underline} and wonder if we will have access to high-quality
medical assistance when we need it. Finally, we bemoan the decline of
moral consensus, rising rates of divorce, drug use among high school
students, and disturbing numbers of pregnant teen-agers. From childhood
on, we are told that good citizenship demands that we educate ourselves
on political matters and vote to protect the polis; the success of
democracy allegedly demands no less. For those who accept this challenge
instead of embracing the political alienation of Generation X and
becoming devotees of Beavis and Butthead, social criticism is what good
citizens do.

[[Debate differs from other]{.mark} species of social [criticism because
**debate is a game played by students who want to win**]{.mark}.
However, conceiving of debate as a kind of social criticism has
**considerable merit**. [Social criticism is **not restricted to a
technocratic elite**]{.mark} or **group of elected
officials**]{.underline}. Moreover, [social criticism [is
**not**]{.mark}]{.underline} necessarily idle or **[[wholly]{.mark}
[deconstructive]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Instead, [[such
criticism]{.mark} **necessarily [is a prerequisite to]{.mark} any effort
to create [policy change]{.mark}**, [whether]{.mark} that criticism is
[articulated by an]{.mark} **elected [official]{.mark}** [or by a
**mother**]{.mark} **of six** whose primary workplace is the home. [When
one]{.mark} **[challenges the s]{.mark}tatus [quo]{.mark}**,
[one]{.mark} normally [implies that a]{.mark} **better [alternative
course of action exists]{.mark}**. Given that]{.underline}
intercollegiate [debate]{.underline} frequently [involves **exchanges
over a proposition of policy** by student advocates who are **relatively
unlikely ever to debate before Congress**, envisioning]{.underline}
intercollegiate [debate as a **specialized extension of**]{.underline}
ordinary citizen [**inquiry** and **advocacy** in the public sphere
seems attractive. Thinking of debate as]{.underline} a variety of
[social criticism gives debate an **added dimension of public
relevance**]{.underline}.

[[One way to understand the distinction]{.mark} [between]{.mark} [debate
as policy-making and]{.mark} debate as [social criticism
is]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}to examine Roger W. Cobb and Charles D.
Elder's agenda-building theory.5 Cobb and Elder are well known for their
[analytic [split of the]{.mark} **[formal]{.mark} [agenda]{.mark}** [for
policy change]{.mark}, which includes legislation or other action
proposed by policy makers with formal power]{.underline} (e.g.,
government bureaucrats, U.S. Senators), [[from the **public
agenda**]{.mark} for policy change, [which is composed of]{.mark} all
[those who **work outside formal**]{.mark} **policy-making
[circles]{.mark}** to exert influence on the formal agenda]{.underline}.
[Social movements]{.underline}, lobbyists, political action committees,
mass media outlets, and public opinion polls all constitute the public
agenda, which, in turn, [has an effect on **what issues come to the
forefront** on the formal agenda]{.underline}. From the agenda-building
perspective, [[one **cannot understand**]{.mark} **the making of [public
policy]{.mark}** [in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [without
comprehending]{.mark} the confluence of [the]{.mark} [**formal** and
**public agenda**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[In]{.underline} intercollegiate [debate, the policy-making metaphor has
**given primacy** to formal agenda functions at the expense of the
public agenda]{.underline}. Debaters are encouraged to bypass thinking
about the public agenda in outlining policy alternatives; appeals for
policy change frequently are made by debaters under the strange pretense
that they and/or their judges are members of the formal agenda elite.
Even arguments about the role of the public in framing public policy are
typically issued by debaters as if those debaters were working within
the confines of the formal agenda for their own, instrumental advantage.
(For example, one thinks of various social movement "backlash"
disadvantage arguments, which advocate a temporary policy paralysis in
order to stir up public outrage and mobilize social movements whose
leaders will demand the formal adoption of a presumably superior policy
alternative.) [The policy-making metaphor concentrates on the formal
agenda to the **near exclusion** of the public agenda]{.underline}, as
the focus of a Katsulas or a Dempsey on the "real-world" limitations for
making policy indicates.

[Deb[ate as social criticism **does not entail exclusion of formal
agenda concerns** from intercollegiate debate. The **specified
agent**]{.mark} **of action**]{.underline} in typical policy resolutions
[[makes ignoring the formal agenda]{.mark} of the United States
government [an **impossibility**]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [[one
**need not be able to influence**]{.mark} [**the formal agenda
directly** in order to discuss **what**]{.mark} **it is that [the
U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[gov]{.mark}ernment [should do]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Undergraduate
debaters and their judges usually are far removed---both physically and
functionally---from the arena of formal-agenda deliberation. [[What the
disputation of]{.mark} student [debaters]{.mark} **most closely
[resembles]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to the extent that it resembles any
real-world analog, [[is **public-agenda**]{.mark} **social
[criticism]{.mark}**. What students are doing is **something they really
CAN do** as students and ordinary citizens; they are **working in their
own modest way** to shape the public agenda]{.underline}.

While "social criticism" is the best explanation for what debaters do,
this essay goes a step further. [The mode of criticism in which debaters
operate is the **production of utopian literature**]{.underline}.
Strictly speaking, [[debaters engage in the **creation** ]{.mark}**of
fictions** [and]{.mark} the **[comparison of fictions to]{.mark} one
[another]{.mark}**. [How else does one]{.mark} [explain the]{.mark}
**affirmative advocacy of a [plan]{.mark}**, a **counterfactual world**
[that]{.mark}, by definition, **[does not exist]{.mark}**?]{.underline}
Indeed, traditional [[inherency]{.mark} burdens **[demand]{.mark} that
such [plans be utopian]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} in the sense
that current attitudes or structures make the immediate enactments of
such plans unlikely in the "real world" of the formal agenda.
Intercollegiate [debate is utopian because plan]{.underline} and/or
counterplan [enactment is **improbable**. While one can distinguish
between **incremental** and **radical policy change proposals**, the
distinction **makes no difference** in the utopian practice of
intercollegiate debate.]{.underline}

More importantly, intercollegiate [[debate is utopian]{.mark} in another
sense. [Policy]{.mark} [change is considered]{.mark} [because such
change]{.mark}, it is hoped, [will **facilitate the pursuit of the good
life**]{.mark}. For decades]{.underline}, intercollegiate [[debaters
have used **fiat**]{.mark} [or]{.mark} the authority of [the word
"**should**" to propose **radical changes**]{.mark} in the social order,
in addition to advocacy of the **incremental policy changes** typical of
the U.S. formal agenda. [This]{.mark} **wide range of policy
alternatives** discussed]{.underline} in contemporary intercollegiate
debate [[is the sign of a **healthy public sphere**,]{.mark} where
**thorough consideration of all policy alternatives** is a possibility.
Utopian fiction]{.underline}, in which the good place that is no place
is envisioned, [makes possible the **instantiation of a rhetorical
vision prerequisite to building that good place** in our tiny corner of
the universe]{.underline}. Even Lewis Mumford, a critic of utopian
thought, concedes that we "can never reach the points of the compass;
and so no doubt we shall never live in utopia; but without the magnetic
needle we should not be able to travel intelligently at all" (Mumford
24-25).

[An objection]{.underline} to this guiding metaphor [is that it
encourages debaters to]{.underline} do precisely that to which Snider
would object, which is to ["**make believe**" that utopia is
**possible**. This]{.underline} objection **[misunderstands the
argument]{.underline}**. These [[students]{.mark} [**already are writers
of utopian fiction** from the **moment they construct their**]{.mark}
[**first plan** or **counterplan text**]{.mark}. Debaters who advocate
policy change **announce their commitment to changing the organization
of society** in pursuit of the good life, even though they have **no
formal power** to call this counterfactual world into being. **[Any
proposed change]{.mark}**, **no matter how small**, [is a **repudiation
of policy**]{.mark}]{.underline} paralysis [**\[[limitations]{.mark}\]**
[and]{.mark} the **maintenance [of the s]{.mark}tatus [quo]{.mark}**. As
**already practiced**, debate **revolves around utopian
proposals**]{.underline}, at least in the sense that debaters and judges
lack the formal authority to enact their proposals. Even those negatives
who defend the current social order frequently do so by pointing to the
potential dystopic consequences of accepting such proposals for change.

[[Understanding debate as utopian]{.underline}]{.mark} literature
[**[would not eliminate references to]{.mark} the vagaries of making
[public policy]{.mark}**, [including **debates over**]{.mark} **the
advantageousness of [plans]{.mark}** [and
**counterplans**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As noted above, [talking about
public policy is **not making public policy**, and a **retreat** from
the policy-making metaphor would have **relatively little
effect**]{.underline} on the contemporary practice of intercollegiate
debate.6 For example, while space constraints prevent a thorough
discussion of this point, the utopian literature metaphor would not
necessitate the removal of all constraints on fiat, although some
utopian proposals will tax the imagination where formal-agenda policy
change is concerned.

[The utopian literature metaphor **does not ineluctably divorce debate**
from the problems and concerns of **ordinary people** and **everyday
life**. There will continue to be debates focused on **incremental
policy changes** as steps along the path to utopia. [What the]{.mark}
utopian literature [metaphor does is]{.mark} to [**position debaters**,
**coaches**, and **judges** as]{.mark} [the]{.mark} **unapologetic
[social critics]{.mark}** that [they]{.mark} are and [have always
been]{.mark}]{.underline}, without the confining influence of a guiding
metaphor that limits their ability to search for the good life. Further,
this metaphor does not encourage the debaters to carry the utopian
literature metaphor to extremes by imagining that they are sitting in a
corner and penning the next great American novel. [The metaphor is
useful because it [**orients debaters to their role as social critics**,
**without**]{.mark} **the [suggestion that debate is anything other than
a]{.mark}n educational [game]{.mark}** played by undergraduate
students.]{.underline}

### 2nc limits k/t creativity

#### Constraints actually fuel innovation and creativity

David [Intrator,]{.underline} President of The Creative Organization,
October 21, [2010]{.underline}, "Thinking Inside the Box,"
http://www.trainingmag.com/article/thinking-inside-box

[One of the **[most pernicious myths]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[about
creativity,]{.underline}** one [[that]{.underline} **[seriously inhibits
creative thinking]{.underline}**]{.mark} and innovation, **[[is the
belief that one needs to "think outside the box]{.underline}]{.mark}**."
As someone who has worked for decades as a professional creative,
**[[nothing could be further from the truth]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[[This a is view shared by the **vast majority** of
creative]{.underline}s]{.mark}, expressed famously by the modernist
designer Charles Eames when he wrote, "**[[Design depends]{.mark}
largely [upon constraints]{.mark}."]{.underline}** The myth of [thinking
outside the box stems from a]{.underline} **[fundamental misconception
of what creativity is]{.underline}**, and what it's not. [In the popular
imagination, creativity is something weird and wacky.]{.underline} The
creative process is magical, or divinely inspired. But, in fact,
[[creativity is]{.underline}]{.mark} not about divine inspiration or
magic. It's **[[about problem-solving, and by definition a problem is a
constraint, a limit]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a box. One of the best
illustrations of this is the work of [photographers]{.underline}. They
[create by excluding the great mass what's before them]{.underline},
**[choosing a small frame in which to work]{.underline}**. Within that
tiny frame, literally a box, they uncover relationships and establish
priorities. What makes creative problem-solving uniquely challenging is
that you, as the creator, are the one defining the problem. You're the
one choosing the frame. And you alone determine what's an effective
solution. This can be quite demanding, both intellectually and
emotionally. [[Intellectually,]{.underline} **[you are required to
establish limits]{.underline}**]{.mark}, set priorities, and cull
patterns and relationships **[[from a great deal of
material]{.underline}]{.mark}**, much of it fragmentary. More often than
not, this is the material you generated during brainstorming sessions.
At the end of these sessions, you're usually left with a big mess of
ideas, half-ideas, vague notions, and the like. Now, chances are you've
had a great time making your mess. You might have gone off-site, enjoyed
a "brainstorming camp," played a number of warm-up games. You feel
artistic and empowered. But [[to be truly creative]{.mark}, you have to
clean up your mess, organizing those fragments into
something]{.underline} real, something [useful]{.underline}, something
that actually works. That's the hard part. It takes a lot of energy,
time, and willpower to make sense of the mess you've just generated. It
also can be emotionally difficult. **[[You'll need to throw out many
ideas you originally thought were grea]{.mark}t]{.underline}**, ideas
you've become attached to, [[because they simply don't fit into the
rules you're creating as you build your box]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Our framework preserves switch side debate, which is key to critical thinking

**Harrigan 8** (Casey, Associate Director of Debate at UGA, Master's in
Communications -- Wake Forest U., "A Defense of Switch Side Debate",
Master's thesis at Wake Forest, Department of Communication, May, pp.
6-9)

Additionally, there are social benefits to the practice of requiring
students to debate both sides of controversial issues. Dating back to
the Greek rhetorical tradition, great value has been placed on the
benefit of testing each argument relative to all others in the
marketplace of ideas. Like those who argue on behalf of the
efficiency-maximizing benefits of free market competition, it is
believed that [arguments are most rigorously tested (and conceivably
refined and improved) when compared to all available alternatives. Even
for beliefs that have seemingly been ingrained in consensus
opinion]{.underline} or in cases where the public at-large is unlikely
to accept a particular position, it has been argued that [they should
remain open for public [discussion]{.mark} and deliberation]{.underline}
(Mill, 1975). Along these lines, [[the greatest benefit of switching
sides]{.mark}, which goes to the heart of contemporary debate,
[is]{.mark} its inducement of [critical thinking]{.mark}. Defined as
\"reasonable reflective thinking that is focused on deciding what to
believe or do]{.underline}\" (Ennis, 1987, p.10), [[critical thinking
learned through debate teaches students not just how advocate and argue,
but how to decide]{.mark} as well.]{.underline} [Each]{.underline} and
every [student]{.underline}, whether in debate or (more likely) at some
later point in life, [will be placed in the position of the
decision-maker]{.underline}. Faced with competing options whose costs
and benefits are initially unclear, [critical thinking is necessary to
assess all]{.underline} the [possible outcomes]{.underline} of each
choice, compare their relative merits, [and arrive at some final
decision about which is preferable.]{.underline} In some instances, such
as choosing whether to eat Chinese or Indian food for dinner, the
importance of making the correct decision is minor. For many other
decisions, however, the implications of choosing an imprudent course of
action are potentially grave. As Robert Crawford notes, there are
\"issues of unsurpassed important in the daily lives of millions upon
millions of people\...being decided to a considerable extent by the
power of public speaking\" (2003). Although the days of the Cold War are
over, and the risk that \"The next Pearl Harbor could be \'compounded by
hydrogen\" (Ehninger and Brockriede, 1978, p.3) is greatly reduced, [the
manipulation of public support before the invasion of Iraq in 2003
points to the continuing necessity of training a well-informed and
critically-aware public]{.underline} (Zarefsky, 2007). [[In the absence
of debate-trained critical thinking, ignorant but ambitious politicians
and persuasive]{.mark} but nefarious [leaders would be much more likely
to draw the]{.mark}]{.underline} country, and possibly the [[world, into
conflicts with incalculable losses]{.mark} in terms of human well-being.
[Given]{.mark} the]{.underline} [[myriad]{.underline}
[threats]{.underline}]{.mark} of global proportions [[that will require
incisive solutions]{.mark}, including global warming, the spread of
pandemic diseases, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
[cultivating a robust and effective society of critical decision-makers
is ess]{.mark}ential]{.underline}. As Louis Rene Beres writes,
\"[with]{.underline} such [learning, we]{.underline} Americans [could
prepare]{.underline}\...not as immobilized objects of false contentment,
but [as authentic citizens of an endangered planet]{.underline}\"
(2003). Thus, it is not surprising that critical thinking has been
called \"the highest educational goal of the activity\" (Parcher, 1998).
While arguing from conviction can foster limited critical thinking
skills, [[the element of switching sides is necessary to]{.mark} sharpen
debate\'s critical edge and [ensure]{.mark} that [decisions are made in
a reasoned manner instead of being driven by ideology. Debaters trained
in SSD are more likely to evaluate both sides of an argument before
arriving at a conclusion and are less likely to dismiss potential
arguments based on his or her prior beliefs]{.mark}]{.underline} (Muir
1993). In addition, [[debating both sides teaches \"conceptual
flexibility,\" where]{.mark} [decision-makers are more likely to reflect
upon the beliefs that are held before coming to a final
opinion]{.mark}]{.underline} (Muir, 1993, p,290). Exposed to many
arguments on each side of an issue, [debaters learn that public policy
is characterized by extraordinary complexity]{.underline} that requires
careful consideration before action. Finally, [[these arguments are
confirmed by preponderance of empirical research demonstrating a link
between competitive SSD and critical thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Allen, Berkowitz, Hunt and Louden, 1999; Colbert, 2002, p.82).

### limits (grossberg)

#### Their interpretation unlimits debate to the point of meaninglessness -- it makes engagement [impossible]{.underline} and eliminates all educational value of the 1ac and [foregoes a genuine conversation with difference]{.underline}

**Grossberg, 15 -** Morris Davis Distinguished Professor University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Lawrence, [We All Want to Change the
World THE PARADOX OF THE U.S. LEFT A POLEMIC]{.underline},
<http://www.lwbooks.co.uk/ebooks/we_all_want_to_change_the_world.pdf>)//DH

I will, in the following description, focus on the situation in the
human sciences (rather than the hard sciences), where [the explosion of
publication creates an ever-expanding circle in which there is always
**too much to read**]{.underline}---[too many positions, too many
arguments, too much contradictory evidence]{.underline}---so that
scholars have to rely on either the author\'s stature or theoretical
and/or political agreement. [It has become]{.underline} almost
[**impossible to read everything** one must read]{.underline},
everything necessary to legitimate, at least in traditional terms, the
claim of academic expertise or scholarship. In fact, given this
situation (and its consequences as I will describe below), the most
surprising thing is how much good work continues to be produced.

[This]{.underline} situation [has **serious consequences**]{.underline}:
[First,]{.underline} one\'s [expertise becomes defined in increasingly
narrow terms, resulting in the proliferation of
sub-fields.]{.underline}9 **\[insert footnote 9\]** [For example, one
might point to security studies, surveillance studies, transition
studies, game studies, code studies, hip-hop studies, horror studies,
etc.]{.underline} **\[Footnote 9 ends\]** And while each of them is
valuable for their interdisciplinary efforts around a new empirical
field, they all too often act as if the questions (and the realities
they interrogate) are new; unfortunately, [they rarely say anything new
or surprising]{.underline}, anything that has not been said elsewhere.
[They frequently simply re-discover in their own empirical \"pocket\"
universe what others have said previously in other fields]{.underline}.
For example, all sorts of technologically defined sub-fields rediscover
the rather old assumption that media audiences are active. This is
partly because, [within each subfield, one gets the impression of
witnessing endless redistributions of a highly circumscribed set of
citations and authors, under a series of ever-changing terms to describe
their]{.underline} fields or [positions]{.underline}. So, academics
create ever shrinking circles in which authors cite a few theoretically
and politically compatible works, and then follow the footnotes, all of
which ultimately lead back to the original authors, creating an
endlessly self-referential closed system of citations, a numbingly
predictable, circular tissue of references. [Second, one is less likely
to read work that appears tangential but may nevertheless be absolutely
decisive to producing truly interesting and insightful
research]{.underline}. Asking significant questions should demand that
one makes reference to all sorts of concepts and questions which would
lead one to follow other unexpected traditions and lines of research,
since [any investigation]{.underline} (e.g., around questions of
participation, publics, or leadership, to use only a few examples that
have irked me recently) [is likely to open up to an entire history of
problematization, of conversations and debates, but]{.underline} **[who
can afford the time and energy anymore]{.underline}**. [Third, one tends
to read only the most recent work since so much is being
published]{.underline}---in various media---[so rapidly that there is
**little time to go back and read**]{.underline}. [Fourth, one tends to
select one\'s sources according to criteria that have more to do
with]{.underline} theoretical and [political sympathies than with an
understanding of research as **a conversation with
difference**]{.underline}. [One reads selectively, finding those ideas
that are already in line with what one assumes one already
knows]{.underline}, and one establishes a body of near-sacred texts;
fifth, one selects topics that are au courant, partly because there is
less scaffolding that one has to build upon and partly because one\'s
work is more likely to gain visibility and impact. Sixth, [**complexity
goes out the door** as one increasingly \"sees the world in a grain of
sand]{.underline}.\" One can no longer be satisfied claiming to have
discovered merely a new piece of a complex puzzle or even an interesting
redeployment of an older practice or structure, because such claims do
not bring fame and glory---either to oneself or the university. Instead,
one has to have discovered the leading edge, the new key or essence. One
good but relatively small idea is expanded into a metonym for the entire
economy, culture or society. Instead of seeking new discursive forms to
embody complexity, uncertainty and humility, one goes with elegance,
hyperbole and the ever receding new.

### fairness/monologues (dascal and knoll)

#### [FAIRNESS]{.underline}\-\--post-facto revision of the topic [unlimits]{.underline} and produces [incentives to avoid]{.underline} due to lack of a stable [agent]{.underline} or [mechanism]{.underline}.

**Dascal and Knoll '11** \[Marcelo and Amnon; May 18th; former Professor

He opposes positions whose 'exclusionist' outlook rejects the normative
approach to the political sphere on the grounds that "normative
statements can never be subjected to a reasonable discussion" (ibid.:
2), because---he argues---the discussion of politics "is an area of
vital interest to all of us and should clearly not be excluded from
argumentative reasonableness" (ibid.: 3)---a view with which we are
prone to agree. Nevertheless, he admits that [[in the
**present**]{.underline}]{.mark} situation [critical discussion is far
from being systematically]{.underline} and [successfully
applied]{.underline} to that vital area: "In representative democracies,
however, the out-comes of the political process tend to be predominantly
the product of negotiations be-tween political leaders rather than the
result of a universal and mutual process of deliberative disputation"
(ibid.). Political **[[debates]{.underline}]{.mark}**, therefore,
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} 'quasi-discussions', i.e., "[[**monologues
calculated** only to **win**]{.mark} the **audience's [consent]{.mark}**
[to one's]{.mark} **own [views]{.mark}**[", rather than
'**genuine**]{.mark} discussions']{.underline}, i.e., serious attempts
to have an **[intellectual [exchange]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which is
typical of critical discussions (ibid.). In order to overcome this
situation, "democracy should always have promoted such a critical
discussion of standpoints as a central aim. Only if this is the case can
stimulating participation in political discourse enhance the quality of
democracy\" (ibid.). [[This can be achieved]{.underline}]{.mark},
however, [[**only** by following]{.mark} "the dialectical **[rules for
argument]{.mark}ative discourse**]{.underline} that make up a code of
conduct for political discourse \[and\] are therefore of crucial
importance to giving substance to the ideal of participatory democracy"
(ibid.: 4); thereby fully acknowledging that "education in processing
argumentation in a critical discussion is indispensable for a democratic
society (van Eemeren 1995: 145-146).

The reasons provided for the failure of the adoption of the critical
discussion model in reality ranges from a general allusion to human
nature ("in real-life contexts, it has to be taken into account that
human interaction is not always automatically \'naturally\' and fully
oriented toward the ideal of dialectical reasonableness \"; van Eemeren
2010: 4) to specific political sphere argumentation handicaps
(unwillingness of people "to subject their thinking to critical
scrutiny"; "vested interest in particular outcome"; "inequality in power
and resources; "different levels of critical skills"; and "a practical
demand for an immediate settlement"; van Eemeren 2010: 4). Although
these causes may have some explanatory value in some cases, in our
opinion their modus operandi is not accounted for and, what is more
important, they do not cover the full spectrum of challenges that the
successful use of critical discussion in the public and political
spheres must face, as we have seen (cf. sections 2 and 3).

No wonder that van Eemeren himself raises the question "whether
maintaining the dialectical ideal of critical discussion in political
and other real-life contexts is not utopian" (ibid.), to which he
replies by admitting that \"\[t\]he ideal of a critical discussion is by
definition not a description of any kind of reality but sets a
theoretical standard that can be used for heuristic, analytic and
evaluative purpose" (ibid.). This ideal seems to be so inspiring that it
remains valid as a pure theoretical ideal, "even if the argumentative
discourse falls short of the dialectical ideal" (ibid.).

In the light of the substantial gap between the normative ideal and the
actual practices of public and political argumentation that PD's
description and explanation provides, a number of doubts arise: [[Are
there **structural**]{.mark},]{.underline} rather than merely contingent
[[obstacles in idealized]{.mark} **critical [discussion]{.mark}** [that
prevents]{.mark} even [its **approximate use**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the public sphere**[[?]{.underline}]{.mark}** Can a theory that claims
to be a praxis based normative system fulfill its promise if it sets up
a threshold that no one who tries to apply it to the public sphere can
reach? Doesn't the very fact that argumentation is excessively idealized
in the model PD proposes cause the gap by distancing people concerned by
public issues from argumentation at all? All [[these
doubts]{.underline}]{.mark} suggest that a powerful structural
phenomenon like the existence of CSDs in the public sphere is perhaps
overlooked by PD and **[[require]{.underline}]{.mark}**s, for its
overcoming, a radically different approach.

4.2 Discrepancies between the PD approach and reasonable argumentation
in the public sphere

The discrepancies in question have to do with basic
**[[parameters]{.underline}]{.mark}** relevant to every argumentative
process, namely[[:]{.underline}]{.mark}

\(A\) The discussants' goals and targets: what do they expect to achieve
through the argumentation process and what is it capable of providing.

\(B\) [The [**preconditions** for initiating]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[**critical [discussion]{.mark}**:]{.underline} what are the discussants
presumed to know and accept of these preconditions.

\(C\) [The **[argumentative process]{.mark}**]{.underline} that is
supposed to lead to the achievement of the discussants' goals.

\(D\) The influence of **[[context and agents]{.underline}]{.mark}** on
the argumentative process.

4.2.1 Goals

Assuming that [[argumentation is]{.mark} a **[voluntary]{.mark}
endeavor**]{.underline}, the parties are presumed to engage in it if and
only if: (i) the process will serve their goals; (ii) these goals cannot
be achieved by different, better means.

PD describes as follows the aim of engaging in an argumentative process:

**[[Argument]{.mark}ation]{.underline}** is basically aimed at resolving
a difference of opinion about the acceptability of a standpoint by
making an appeal to the other party\'s reasonableness. (van Eemeren
2010: 1, with reference to van Eemeren & Grootendorst 2004: 11-18)

The difference of opinion is resolved when the antagonist accepts the
protagonist\'s viewpoint on the basis of the arguments advanced or when
the protagonist abandons his viewpoint as a result of the critical
responses of the antagonist. (van Eemeren 2010: 33)

Simply put, the basic assumption is that a critical discussion's aim
[[consists]{.mark} in [putting forth a]{.mark}]{.underline} certain
[[**position** by one of the parties for]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[**critical [examination]{.mark}** [of the other]{.mark}]{.underline},
who calls it into question. The latter undertakes to refute the former's
position, while its proponent is committed to defend it. Four stages
(see below) are supposed to ensure a valid performance of the refutation
and defense tasks. The essential point is that at the end of the four
stages the parties clearly agree whether the proponent's position has
been refuted or not and, accordingly, change their position (either
retracting it or withdrawing from his questioning). In 'mixed'
disagreements, in which the antagonist not only questions but also puts
forth an opposed position, the same process takes place sequentially,
i.e., at first one side (A) attacks trying to refute the other's (B)
position, and after this stage is concluded, they switch roles and the
second side (B) proceeds to attack the first (A) in the same fashion.

Regardless of whether the described process is indeed capable to yield a
conclusive decision about the refutation of a position, and of whether
the linearity of the refutation process makes sense, it is obvious that
debates in the public sphere are for the most part 'mixed'. Furthermore,
in so far as these debates involve dichotomous positions (rather than
just opposed ones), it is necessary that at the end of the PD process
one of the parties accept the position of the other.

It is also worth noticing that, contrary to deliberative democracy
approaches, which in some cases approve the attempt to reach agreement
in a (public) debate as a form of justification of political systems, PD
claims that it is not a consensus theory at all. Instead, it conceives
itself as a theory based on Popper's critical rationality, i.e., as
having as its principal goal to provide each party with the
means---i.e., refutation attempts---to test critically its position:

\[T\]he conception of reasonableness upheld in pragma-dialectics
insights from critical rationalist epistemology and utilitarian ethics
conjoin ... The intersubjective acceptability we attribute to the
procedure, which is eventually expected to lend conventional validity to
the procedure, is primarily based on its instrumentality in doing the
job it is intended to do: re-solving a difference of opinion. ... This
means that, philosophically speaking, the rationale for accepting the
pragma-dialectical procedure is pragmatic---more precisely, utilitarian
\[italics in quoted text\]. ... However, based on Popper\'s
falsification idea, this is a 'negative' and not 'positive',
utilitarianism. ... Rather than maximization of agreement, minimization
of disagreement is to be aimed for. (van Eemeren 2010: 34)

The distinction between maximization of agreement and minimization of
disagreement purports to stress that PD doesn't view agreement as the
suitable end of the process, but just as "an intermediate step on the
way to new, and more advanced, disagreements" (van Eemeren 2010: 26n).
Nevertheless, no explanation is given of how these "more advanced
disagreements" are engendered as a part of the dynamics of the critical
process, nor what is the role or value of such disagreements in the
public sphere or elsewhere. This may be due to the fact that PD's
'critical discussion' is not tuned to the generation of new positions or
ideas but only to the testing of extant ones, thus echoing once again
Popper, now in his focus on the justification rather than on the
discovery of theories (see sections 4.2.4 and 5).

In any case, it is quite clear that the only practical result of the
critical discussion à la PD of opposed positions on a public issue is to
determine whether one discussant succeeded in refuting the other's
position, thus obtaining the adversary's agreement, who will then share
his/her position, at least for some time. In this respect, PD's critical
discussion is close to Habermas's 'reasonable argumentation', whose aim
is to reach consensus.15 In spite of the apparent difference between a
critical examination of a position aiming at its refutation or at its
acceptance, even van Eemeren admits, to some extent, their similarity.
He points out that "the pragma-dialectical procedure deals only with
'first order' conditions for resolving differences of opinion on the
merits by means of critical discussion" (van Eemeren 2010: 34), and
stresses that there are 'higher order' conditions, 'internal' and
'external', that are "beyond the agent's control", conditions that are
similar to Habermas's "ideal speech conditions" (van Eemeren 2010: 35n).
Anyhow, whether according to PD the main goal of the critical discussion
process in the public alliance is to create the opportunity for
refutation or for agreement (meaning that one of the discussants
acknowledges that his position is wrong), the essential assumption of
this process is that the participants in it in the public sphere (or
elsewhere) must be aware that one of them holds a wrong position and
will have to explicitly acknowledge this.

Is such a goal, especially when conceived as the ultimate aim of the
proposed argumentative process, feasible and acceptable in the public
sphere?

In our opinion, there are at least four reasons for arguing that it is a
utopian, hence unacceptable goal, if one takes seriously what should be
expected from argumentative practice and theory in the public sphere.
First, because PD deserves a critique similar to the one leveled against
the Popperian version of critical rationalism it espouses,16 which
defends a theory of knowledge "without a knowing subject" (Popper 1972);
obviously, such a-contextual position becomes even more problematic if
applied to the public and political spheres, where it must operate in a
context essentially involved with practical rationality. Second, due to
its analogy with theories such as Habermas's that were discussed in this
section as well as in 2.2---an analogy that deserves additional
criticism because, unlike Habermasianism, PD overlooks the relationship
between the political and public context and argumentative practice.
Third, because of PD's total overlooking of the role of CSDs in public
argumentation (cf. 4.2.2). And fourth, due to unilateral value judgments
of positions in the public sphere, which lead to simplistic criteria of
refutation or acceptance in a domain where complexity is the rule (cf.
2.1.1 and 4.2.3).

\(ii\) Let us admit, for the sake of argument, that the refutation goal
as claimed by PD is central, feasible, acceptable, and useful in public
argumentation. Aren't there better ways to achieve this goal?

The refutation and defense moves stipulated by the PD critical
discussion model include, on the one side, the antagonist's critical
remarks or demands and on the other, the proponent's replies. We believe
that it must be assumed that neither the critique nor the replies are
previously known to the contenders, which is why they have an interest
in engage in the argumentation process: presumably, the expression of
both, counter-arguments and defensive-arguments, is good to both sides.
In spite of its usefulness in certain situations, this kind of exchange
does not amount to the full manifestation of the dialectical critical
process, wherein the context and co-text of the dialectical exchange, as
well as the cognitive interaction that takes place and evolves
throughout the exchange, play a decisive role in the design and 'inner'
justification of each of the participants' moves. Argumentation
strategies that take into account these resources and make full use of
their potential are no doubt setting up another, broader span of goals
for the argumentative process, and are more likely to achieve these
goals more effectively than they certainly would achieve their PD more
limited counterparts (cf. 4.2.4 and 5).

4.2.2 Preconditions

The ideal PD [**critical [discussion]{.mark}** [can **only** be realized
if]{.mark}]{.underline} some [[**preconditions** are **satisfied**. The
most important]{.underline}]{.mark} ones [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} a)
[a **[clear]{.mark}-cut** [identification of the **standpoint** that
provokes]{.mark} the **[disagreement]{.mark}**]{.underline}, b) the
decision of the parties to engage in a discussion,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} c) the participants' [[commitment
to]{.underline}]{.mark} obey the **[procedural
[rules]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As we shall see, these preconditions
share a common assumption, which calls into question the feasibility of
using critical discussion in the public sphere.

\(A\) [[This **precondition** assumes]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[it is
possible to **isolate**]{.mark} **rigorously** [the **subject**]{.mark}
**matter**]{.underline} of a critical discussion, so as [[to
conduct]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[focused
[discussion]{.mark}]{.underline}** that makes use only of relevant
arguments. This precondition is quite strict, for whenever both
discussants defend contrary standpoints, their disagreement should be
treated as two separate fully fledged discussions: "... if another
discussion begins, it must go through the same stages again---from
confrontation stage to concluding stage" (van Eemeren 2010: 10n).

\(B\) This precondition subordinates the decision to engage in the
discussion to the evaluation that the discussants share enough common
ground to pursue it adequately: "After the parties have decided that
there is enough common ground to conduct a discussion ..." (van Eemeren
2010: 33).

\(C\) [[This **precondition**]{.mark} stresses the 'contractual'
character of a critical discussion, which [requires]{.mark} **explicit
[mutual commitments]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} the
[discussants]{.mark}.]{.underline} Its rationale is that
[[without]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[**commitments** the aim
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**critical [discussion]{.mark}**[, i.e.
**the resolution**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the difference of opinions,
[[will **not be achieved**, which makes engaging]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the discussion **[[pointless]{.underline}]{.mark}**: "There is no point
in venturing to resolve a difference ... if there is no mutual
commitment to a common starting point, which may include procedural
commitments as well as substantive agreement" (van Eemeren and
Grootendorst 2004: 60).

These **['first order' [preconditions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as they
are labeled in PD (cf. van Eemeren 2010: 33), [[are]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[conditions that candidates]{.mark} to participate]{.underline} in
a critical discussion **[[must fulfill]{.underline}]{.mark}** if they
intend to do so and can afford it personally (a 'second order'
condition) and politically (a 'third order' condition).17 In addition,
the first order conditions demand from the prospective discussants a
clear, distinct, and detailed picture of the scope of the discussion
that they are about to engage in. This means not mixing up the various
differences of opinion that the discussion may involve, and being able
to separate them properly as the subject matter for independent
discussions; [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} further [[**requirement**
is]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**anticipated [identification]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} the pieces of the 'substantive agreement'
forming [[the **starting point**]{.mark} in order [to
ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} that they are sufficient for conducting the
discussion up to a **[satisfactory [closure]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Mitchell (1998) provides a thorough examination of the pedagogical
implication for academic debate. Although Mitchell acknowledges
that [[**debate** provides **preparation** for]{.mark} participation in
democracy]{.underline}, limiting debate to a laboratory where students
practice their skill for future participation is criticized. Mitchell
contends:

For students and teachers of argumentation, the heightened salience of
this question should signal the danger that critical thinking and oral
advocacy skills alone may not be sufficient for citizens to assert their
voices in public deliberation. (p. 45)

Mitchell contends that the laboratory style setting creates barriers to
other spheres, creates a \"sense of detachment\" and causes debaters to
see research from the role of spectators. Mitchell further calls for
\"**[[argumentative agency]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[[which\] involves
[the **capacity** to]{.mark} contextualize]{.underline} and
[[employ]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[skills
and [strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}** of argumentative
discourse [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} fields
of **[social [action]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially wider spheres of
public deliberation\" (p. 45). Although we agree with Mitchell
that [debate can]{.underline} be an even greater instrument of
empowerment for students, we are more interested in examining the impact
of the intermediary step of research. In each of Mitchell\'s examples
of debaters finding creative avenues for agency, there had to be a
motivation to act. It is our contention that the [**[research]{.mark}**
conducted [for **competition** is a]{.mark}]{.underline}
major **[[catalyst]{.underline}]{.mark}** to propel their action,
change their opinions, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[provide a ]{.mark}**greater [depth]{.mark}**
[of **understanding**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the issues involved.

The level of research involved in debate creates an in-depth
understanding of issues. The level of research conducted during a year
of debate is quite extensive. Goodman (1993) references a Chronicle of
Higher Education article that estimated \"the level and extent of
research required of the average college debater for each topic is
equivalent to the amount of research required for a Master\'s
Thesis (cited in Mitchell, 1998, p. 55). With this extensive quantity of
research, debaters attain a high level of investigation and
(presumably) understanding of a topic. As a result of this level of
understanding, debaters become knowledgeable citizens who are further
empowered to make informed opinions and energized to take
action. Research helps to educate students (and coaches) about the state
of the world.

[[Without the guidance of a]{.mark} **debate [topic]{.mark}**[, how many
students would
do ]{.mark}**in-depth [research]{.mark}**[ on ]{.mark}**female genital
[mutilation]{.mark}** [in Africa,

debate. This in turn fuels students' awareness of issues that go
[[beyond their **front doors**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Advocacy flows from
this increased awareness. Reading books and articles about the suffering
of people thousands of miles away or right in our own communities drives
people to become involved in the community at large.

Research has also focused on how debate prepares us for life in the
public sphere. Issues that we discuss in debate have found their way
onto the national policy stage, and training in intercollegiate debate
[[makes us good]{.mark} **public [advocates]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
public sphere is the arena in which we all must participate to be active
citizens. Even after we leave debate, the skills that we have gained
should help us to be better advocates and citizens. Research has looked
at how debate impacts education (Matlon and Keele 1984), legal
training (Parkinson, Gisler and Pelias 1983, Nobles 19850 and behavioral
traits (McGlone 1974, Colbert 1994). These works illustrate the impact
that public debate has on students as they prepare to enter the public
sphere.

Furthermore, the process of intense research for debate may actually
change the positions debaters hold. Since debaters typically enter into
a topic with only cursory (if any) knowledge of the issue, the research
process provides exposure to issues that were previously
unknown. Exposure to the literature on a topic can create, reinforce
or alter an individual\'s opinions. Before learning of the School for
the America\'s, having an opinion of the place is impossible. After
hearing about the systematic training of torturers and oppressors in a
debate round and reading the research, an opinion of the \"school\" was
developed. In this manner, [exposure to debate research as the
person finding the evidence]{.underline}, hearing it as the opponent in
a debate round (or as judge) [acts as a]{.underline}n initial [spark of
awareness on an issue]{.underline}. This process of discovery seems to
have a similar impact to watching an investigative news report.

Mitchell claimed that debate could be more than it was traditionally
seen as, that it could be a catalyst to empower people to act in the
social arena. We surmise that there is a step in between the debate and
the action. The intermediary step where people are inspired to agency is
based on the research that they do. If students are compelled to act,
research is a main factor in compelling them to do so. [[Even
if]{.underline}]{.mark} students are [[**not compelled** to
take]{.underline}]{.mark} direct [[action, research]{.mark} **still
[changes]{.mark}** [opinions]{.mark}]{.underline} and attitudes.

Research often compels students to take action in the social
arena. Debate topics guide students in a direction that allows them to
explore what is going on in the world. Last
year [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} college policy
debate [[topic]{.underline}]{.mark} was,

Resolved: That the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[F]{.underline}]{.mark}**ederal **[[G]{.underline}]{.mark}**overnment [[should]{.underline}]{.mark}
adopt a policy of constructive engagement, including
the immediate removal of all or nearly all economic sanctions, with the
government(s) of one or more of the following nation-states: Cuba, Iran,
Iraq, Syria, North Korea. 

This topic [[spurred]{.underline}]{.mark} quite a bit
of [[activism]{.underline}]{.mark} on the college debate circuit.
Many students become actively involved in protesting for the removal of
sanctions from at least one of the topic countries. The
[[college]{.underline}]{.mark} listserve [[was used to **rally people**
in support of]{.underline}]{.mark}** **various
**[[movements]{.underline}]{.mark}** to remove sanctions on both Iraq
and Cuba. These messages were posted after the research on the topic
began. While this topic did not lend itself to activism beyond rallying
the government, other topics have allowed students to take their
beliefs outside of the laboratory and into action.

In addition to creating awareness, the research process can also
reinforce or alter opinions. By discovering new information in the
research process, people can question their current assumptions
and perhaps formulate a more informed opinion. One example comes from
a summer debate class for children of Migrant workers in North
Dakota (Iverson, 1999). The Junior High aged students chose to debate
the adoption of Spanish as an official language in the U.S. Many
students expressed their concern that they could not argue effectively
against the proposed change because it was a \"truism.\" They were
wholly in favor of Spanish as an official language. After researching
the topic throughout their six week course, many realized much more was
involved in adopting an official language and that they did not \"speak
\'pure\' Spanish or English, but speak a unique dialect and hybrid\"
(Iverson, p. 3). At the end of the class many students became opposed to
adopting Spanish as an official language, but found other ways Spanish
should be integrated into American culture. Without research, these
students would have maintained their opinions and not enhanced their
knowledge of the issue. The students who maintained support of Spanish
as an official language were better informed and thus also more capable
of articulating support for their beliefs. 

The examples of debate and research impacting the opinions and actions
of debaters indicate the strong potential for a direct relationship
between debate research and personal advocacy. However, the debate
community has not created a new sea of activists immersing this planet
in waves of protest and political action. The level of influence debater
search has on people needs further exploration. Also, the process of
research needs to be more fully explored in order to understand if and
why researching for the competitive activity of debate generates more
interest than research for other purposes such as classroom projects.

Since parliamentary debate does not involve research into a single
topic, it can provide an important reference point for examining the
impact of research in other forms of debate. Based upon limited
conversations with competitors and coaches as well as some direct
coaching and judging experience in parliamentary debate, parliamentary
forms of debate has not seen an increase in activism on the part of
debaters in the United States. Although some coaches require research in
order to find examples and to stay updated on current events, the basic
principle of this research is to have a commonsense level of
understanding(Venette, 1998). As the NPDA website explains, \"the reader
is encouraged to be well-read in current events, as well as history,
philosophy, etc. Remember: the realm of knowledge is that of a
\'well-read college student\'\" (NPDA
Homepage,<http://www.bethel.edu/Majors/Communication/npda/faq2.html>).
The focus of research is breadth, not depth. In fact, in-depth research
into one topic for parliamentary debate would seem to be
counterproductive. Every round has a different resolution and for APDA,
at least, those resolutions are generally written so they are open to a
wide array of case examples, So, developing too narrow of a focus could
be competitively fatal. However, research is apparently increasing for
parliamentary teams as reports of \"stock cases\" used by teams for
numerous rounds have recently appeared. One coach did state that a
perceived \"stock case\" by one team pushed his debaters to research the
topic of AIDS in Africa in order to be equally knowledgeable in that
case. Interestingly, the coach also stated that some of their research
in preparation for parliamentary debate was affecting the opinions and
attitudes of the debaters on the team.

Not all debate research appears to generate personal advocacy and
challenge peoples\' assumptions. Debaters must switch sides, so they
must inevitably debate against various cases. While this may seem to be
inconsistent with advocacy, [**supporting and
[researching]{.mark}**[ both sides of]{.mark}]{.underline} an
[[argument]{.underline}]{.mark} actually [[created ]{.mark}**stronger
[advocates]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Not only did [[debaters learn both
sides]{.underline}]{.mark} of an
argument, [[so]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[they could **defend** their
positions **against attack**]{.underline}]{.mark}, they also learned the
nuances of each
position. [[Learning]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[the]{.mark} **intricate
[nature]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}]{.underline} various [**policy
[proposals]{.mark}**[ helps debaters]{.mark} to [strengthen
their]{.mark} **own [stance]{.mark}** on issues]{.underline}.

### role experimentation (connolly) 

#### Role experimentation should orient our politics. the lens of a policymaker can alter our perception in ways that catalyze micro and macro political action. Investigating politics can expose faults in the system in order to foster broader forms of resistance 

**Connolly 13.** William E. Connolly, Krieger-Eisenhower Professor of
Political Science at Johns Hopkins University, The Fragility of Things:

Activism, Duke University Press, 2013, 186

[There is no zone of complete neutrality in a world of role
performances]{.underline}. [Obedient performances in cumulative effect
tend to support the existing regime as they insinuate its dictates into
our collective habits of perception, judgment, and action]{.underline}.
**[Unless a dissident group of workers meticulously "works according to
rule" to disrupt production through excruciating obedience in a way that
discloses how tangled formal rules can become]{.underline}**. Or a group
creatively improvises on the performance of Bartleby the Scrivener,
posing endless questions about the orders given to it until the machine
overflows itself or is jammed. **[These indeed are creative role
experimentations]{.underline}**. [So was the practice in Eastern Europe
during the late stages of Soviet rule to clap endlessly when a Soviet
stooge spoke]{.underline}, [until the bewildered speaker was moved to
sit down amid the roar around him]{.underline}. [I recently attended a
faculty meeting with the president of my university at which the entire
faculty remained silent after his Ceo-style talk ended and he departed
slowly up the aisle. **Sometimes [silence sends a message to
power.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

**[Our lives are messages]{.underline}**.5 **[[Role experimentation can
disrupt and redirect]{.mark} the flow of [authority, habit,
institutional regularity]{.mark}, and future projection]{.underline}**.
**[[It can also encourage others to look more closely at their own
performances]{.mark} in this or that domain]{.underline}**. **[Such
[experiments can]{.mark} also [set the stage for]{.mark} more
adventurous and [larger scale actions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. My
examples will be limited to con- stituencies who are the most apt to
read this book, though they could easily be adjusted to a broader array.

**[[Suppose a constellation of students]{.mark}, studying to enter
professional life, [forms study groups to explore]{.mark} more closely
how those [professions]{.mark} presuppose and enforce a set of practices
that contribute to the fragility of things as they simultaneously draw
attention away from that contribution]{.underline}**. [[The students may
pose **untimely questions** in their political science]{.underline},
[economics, engineering, medical, business, legal, and biology
classes]{.underline}.]{.mark} [If in a secular institution, they may
seek out courses that complicate the assumptions of secularism. If in a
religious school, they may organize a group to explore the history of
atheism or of minority faiths that eschew the theme of a per- sonal
God]{.underline}. **[They can engage experimental artistic work that
stretches their habitual patterns of perception and
judgment]{.underline}**. The nature- and soundscape compositions of John
Luther Adams have salutary effects on many in this respect. **[[Such
activities can]{.mark} also [prime you to experiment with other role
performances once you enter professional life]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
**[If a lawyer, you may]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[organize to [rethink
your connections to the ugly prison system and to adjust your
practice]{.mark} to protest its ugliness]{.underline}**. Or **[[you may
give a portion of your time to challenge corporations]{.mark},
localities, and states [that defile the
environment]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [If a doctor, you may organize
voluntary medical care for the poor and publicize what you are
doing]{.underline}. In both cases **[[these experimentations]{.mark}
make a modest difference on their own, prime our capacities for more
sensitive perception in other domains of life, [and may prepare us to
participate]{.mark} with others [in yet more adventurous
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[These are [minor moments]{.mark},
but an accumulation of minor moments [can jostle settled habits of
perception]{.mark}; they can encourage a readiness to become more
exploratory; and [they can extend the time horizon within which we think
and act]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

[Suppose]{.underline}, now, [you are middle- or upper-middle-class
citizens in a polity that has competitive elections]{.underline}. [You
have become increasingly dissatisfied with the course your society is
taking. **[Voting]{.mark}**]{.underline}, while pertinent, **[[seems
radically insufficient]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the issues involved.
Its time horizon is too short and the strategic place of ill-informed
undecided voters in electoral politics skews campaigns too sharply.
[Inequality has been extended]{.underline}. The [lower reaches of
society are left out in the cold and often blamed for the suffering they
undergo. The news media are organized around scandal and a brief time
horizon]{.underline}. **[Racial differences are exploited to break up
potential coalitions on the left.]{.underline}** [A large slice of the
population is periodically suscep- tible to war fever. Climate change is
widely subjected to deferral, denial, or formal acceptance disconnected
from action. And the right wing actively promotes filibusters and
legislative stalemates to encourage more and more people to withdraw
from citizenship and to tolerate the privatization of more and more of
life.]{.underline}

The sciences and professions with which you are familiar are often too
narrowly defined. Too many churches either provide refuges from the
world or serve as sites of aggressive attack on ecological concerns,
homosexu- ality, carriers of alternative faiths, or poor minorities. You
know what po- litical party you support; [you vote regularly; and you
give time and money to your party. But you also find it difficult to
connect the sentiments you profess to the role expectations sedimented
into your practices of work, church, consumption, neighborhood
association, investment portfolio, children's school, artistic pursuits,
and local news reporting. **[Now is the time to join others in becoming
role experimentalists]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[[You may]{.mark} actively support the **farm-to-table movement** in the
restaurants you visit]{.underline}; you may support **[the slow food
movement]{.underline}**; you may [frequent stores that offer food based
on sustainable processes]{.underline}; you may **[[buy a hybrid]{.mark}
or, if feasible, join an urban zip-car collective]{.underline}**,
explaining to friends, family, and neighbors what effect [such choices
could have on late modern ecology if a majority of the populace did one
or the other]{.underline}; you may press your neighborhood association
and workplace to buy solar panels and install them yourself; **[[you
may]{.mark} use writing and media skills developed in school to [write
for a blog]{.mark}]{.underline}**[; **[you may
shift]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[a large portion of [your]{.mark}
retirement [account into investments that support sustainable
energy]{.mark}]{.underline}**; you may withdraw from aggressive
investments that presuppose an unsustainable growth pattern, threaten
economic collapse, and/or undermine the collec- tive future; you may
bring new issues and visitors to your church, temple, or mosque to
support rethinking about interdenominational issues and the contemporary
fragility of things; you may found, join, or frequent a repair club, at
which volunteers collect and repair old appliances, furni- ture, and
vehicles to cut back on urban waste and increase the longevity of these
items; [you may probe and publicize the multimodal tactics by which
twenty-four-hour news stations work on the visceral register of their
viewers, as you explore ways to counter those techniques]{.underline};
you may travel to places where unconscious American assumptions about
world entitlement are challenged on a regular basis; you may augment
your pattern of films and artistic exhibits attended to stretch your
habitual powers of perception and to challenge some affect-imbued
prejudgments embedded in them; [you may seek out new friends who are
also moving in these directions. You may regularly relay pregnant essays
you encounter to friends, colleagues, and relatives. **[A series of
minor role experiments.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[As we proceed our aspirational selves may now begin to exceed our
operational selves, and the shame we feel about the discrepancy between
these two aspects of the self [may **generate energy to enter into yet
new modes of role experimentation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.6
[We]{.underline} thus [begin to make ourselves and our engagements
**more experimental** rather than simply falling into a ready- made set
of role expectations]{.underline}. We have begun to become what
Nietzsche calls "our own guinea pigs" rather than merely being the
guinea pigs of those in charge of these institutions.

[As such experiments accumulate, the ice in and around us begins to
crack]{.underline}. First, [[the **shaky perceptions**]{.mark}**,
feelings, and beliefs** [with which we started these experimentations
now become more refined]{.mark} and more entrenched]{.underline}.
Second, **[[we are now better situated to forge connections with]{.mark}
yet [larger constituencies]{.mark} engaging in similar
experiments]{.underline}**. Third, [as these connections accumulate we
may be more inspired to join macropolitical movements that speak to the
issues]{.underline}. Fourth, **[as we now join protests, slowdowns, and
confrontational meetings with corporate managers, church leaders, union
officials, university officials, and neighborhood leaders, we may now
become more alert to the institutional pressures that propel these
constituencies forward too]{.underline}**. They are also both enmeshed
in a web of roles that en- able and constrain them and often more than
mere role bearers. These roles too exhibit varying degrees of pressure
and slack as they link the details of daily conduct to the strategic
practices of the larger political economy.

[One advantage of [role experimentation]{.mark} by several
constituencies at multiple sites is that it [speaks to a time in which
**the drive to significant change must today be mobilized by a**]{.mark}
**large, [pluralist assemblage rather than]{.mark} by [a]{.mark} single
class or other [core constituency]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Such an
assemblage must be primed and loaded by several constituencies at many
sites. **Role experimentations and the shape of a pluralist assemblage
thus inflect one another.**]{.underline}

We must condense some of the steps involved. But [perhaps **the
multidimensional pluralist assemblage** in which you have now **begun to
participate** approaches a **tipping point**---crystallized, say, by
movement back and forth between role experiments, shifts in the
priorities of some strategic in- stitutions, and a change in the
contours of electoral politics]{.underline}. Now [a surprising event may
occur, allowing these emergent energies to be crystallized]{.underline}.
At this point **[[some will]{.mark} enter the scene to say [that no kind
of "reformism]{.mark}," no matter how extensive[, is
acceptable]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[We must wait for a]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[bigger[, more total transformation, they will
say]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Such an account will
be]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[offered at]{.mark} precisely [this tipping
point as the only sophisticated reading of the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[But it is not]{.underline}**. Yes,
**[roles, institutions, events, constitutive acts, and larger structures
are interinvolved, with each enabling and limiting
others]{.underline}**. Yes, [we do inhabit a world of multiple
entanglements and interconnections]{.underline}. Yes, [[the primacy of
capitalist markets]{.mark} and private ownership [does give
owners]{.mark} and high-rolling investors [key advantages]{.mark} in
setting the agenda of the state]{.underline}. [Yes, states subject to
public elections are also limited by systemic relations to corporate
structures and the threat of capital strikes]{.underline}. **[Yes,
extreme inequality, combined with legislative and court decisions
inspired by neo- liberal ideology, do disenfranchise many as they
release billions of dollars to right-wing electoral
campaigns]{.underline}**. Yes, private ownership of the media does give
great advantages to the corporate establishment. Yes, dependent workers
do face uphill battles in limiting capital through labor organiza- tion.
Yes, the limited reach of semisovereign states in the global economy
exerts corporate pressure on them, just as, inside the United States at
least, the right-wing Supreme Court's devolution of authority to states
in a fed- eral system forces states to compete with each other for
corporate favors. [Yes, elected representatives are dependent on
campaign money and their desires to find jobs as lobbyists after they
leave office]{.underline}. Yes, [there are pressures on many in the
lower middle class to identify with the vision of the future publicized
by those above them]{.underline}. **[It may therefore appear that there
are no cracks and fissures in these interconnected
processes]{.underline}**. **[I[t may seem that you must either embrace
the system with fervor,]{.mark} withdraw as much as possible from it,
[or wait for an explosio]{.mark}n that changes everything
rapidly.]{.underline}**

**[[The hegemony of neoliberal ideology reinforces such a reading of the
alternatives]{.mark}, in its way, even as it otherwise emphasizes our
inability to have a bird's-eye view of the system]{.underline}**. It
offers a bird's-eye view of the whole whenever it insists that market
self-organization means impersonal market rationality. But repeated
experience belies such an equation. **[There are numerous examples of
surprising economic meltdowns, often ushered into being by submission to
that very ideology]{.underline}**. And **[[periodically critical
movements emerge]{.mark}, as if from nowhere, [to challenge existing
priorities]{.mark} at vulnerable sites]{.underline}**. [There
is]{.underline}, for starters, [[the surprise of **the Arab
Spring**]{.mark}, with its ambivalent possibilities]{.underline}; [[the
**emergence of a New Left**]{.mark} in Euro-American countries in the
1960s and 1970s]{.underline}; [[the birth of **feminist and gay rights
movements**]{.mark} in those same countries that have probed soft spots
in churches, the media, corporate benefit packages, universities, state
policy, and families]{.underline}; [[there is **the "slut
walk"**]{.mark} by which young women challenged the idea that how they
dress determines whether they deserve sexual assault]{.underline};
[[there is **Tiananmen Square**]{.mark}, which revealed currents of
energy and protest in China that are still festering]{.underline};
[[there is the **Occupy**]{.mark} movement]{.underline}, springing as if
from nowhere, [to galvanize previously isolated pockets of
dissatisfaction and unrest]{.underline}; [[there is the **civil rights**
movement]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [has reenergized itself several
times]{.underline}; [[there are]{.mark} several **[ecological
movements]{.mark}**, mobilizing diffuse dissatisfactions with the
direction neoliberal regimes have taken]{.underline}. **[Each of [these
events and movements exposes soft spots]{.mark}, cracks, uneven edges,
and leakages [in "the system]{.mark}," through which new lines of
creative activity can form and pass.]{.underline}**

While under way, [these become creative forays with differing degrees of
self-organization built into them]{.underline}. If and [**[as their
success grows]{.underline}**, **[they may expose]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[yet [more seams and cracks in a system]{.mark} that is far more
replete with rough edges between its subsystems than either its most
ardent ideologues or some of its structural critics may
acknowledge]{.underline}**. **[The [cracks]{.mark}, edges, fissures,
noise, and renegade flows in these processes, hidden by this or that
streamlined view, [are]{.mark} often [rendered visible by such
experimental actions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. One creative thing about
that slut walk is how it incited erotic energy and recruited that energy
for critical politics. More such experiments of this sort are needed in
other domains. [There is no reason in the world to allow sensual desire
to flow into the advertisement, sale, and purchase of cars, clothing,
perfume, vacations, and jewelry but yet to purge it from areas in which
it could help to instigate and mobilize productive political activism.
**Except a self-denying Puritanism within radicalism
itself.**]{.underline}

### ir framework

#### We should debate international relations as a [normative sphere]{.underline} for developing [prescriptive frameworks]{.underline} that are [exportable]{.underline} -- but, it's only effective if debates are [structured]{.underline} and positions are [known in advance]{.underline}, which allows [abstracting]{.underline} hypothetical scenarios from [individual experience]{.underline} to develop [universal principles]{.underline}

[**[Structured debates]{.underline}** [for
**i**]{.underline}]{.mark}[nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations]{.underline} courses [[represent a **synthesis**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[active teaching]{.mark}
[methods]{.mark}]{.underline} described here. [[They draw
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[role-playing]{.mark}
dynamics]{.underline}** [of **[simulations]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the
[**narrative foundation** of the **case method**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[and a system for debate]{.underline}]{.mark} and critical analysis
[[grounded in]{.mark} the [argumentation]{.mark}
literature]{.underline}.

[[Structured debates force students to **define and defend policy
positions**]{.underline}]{.mark} [that are **[assigned in
advance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this way, [[debates demand]{.mark} a
level of personal engagement in the process]{.underline}, a [measure of
group collaboration]{.underline} on debate points, [and a [willingness
to participate in]{.mark}]{.underline} a critical
[[dialogue]{.underline}]{.mark} with the larger group [[about]{.mark}
theoretically [significant policy questions]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Classroom debates are built on the foundation of a common narrative or
background material similar to the case method. For example, students
who are assigned to support the establishment of the International
Criminal Court (ICC) have reviewed similar materials and issues as have
those who must oppose it. Furthermore, they are encouraged to define the
issue, interpret it through theory frameworks, and prescribe policy
options to address specific, real-world problems.

These exercises are structured according to guidelines found in the
argumentation literature. Students are sometimes assigned roles for
debates in advance, and other times they are forced to defend a position
assigned minutes earlier. Debates run according to the systematized
format of some forensics programs, and discourse is structured in a way
to achieve educational objectives. Students may be motivated by
"winning" some of these debates, but they achieve important educational
objectives in the process (Wood and Rowland-Morin, 1989).
[[Argumentation]{.underline}]{.mark} in this form [[can serve as a
medium for]{.underline}]{.mark} both engaged citizenship and
[**[critical thinking]{.underline}** [about **potential solutions** to
**contemporary challenges**]{.underline}]{.mark}. But Cox rightly
cautions that [[political argumentation should be seen as a "**normative
sphere"**]{.mark} where [there is **less absolute truth than** issues
**subject to interpretation**]{.mark}]{.underline} (1981:127).

The literature on active teaching and learning stresses that [exercises
should be **designed** and implemented to **fulfill** a set of
**educational goals**]{.underline}. While objectives may vary, these
[[techniques]{.underline}]{.mark} [are]{.underline} generally [designed
to [help students **move** from **theoretical**
discussions]{.mark}]{.underline} in the classroom [[to **real-world**
experience]{.underline}]{.mark}. The incorporation of active teaching
and learning exercises into international relations courses should also
take into account the time requirement and intensity of the exercise,
the amount of student preparation needed, and related resource concerns.
Finally, most successful active teaching approaches include a period for
reflection on theory applications and lessons learned from the
experience. In Kolb's experiential learning preference model, for
example, particular attention is devoted to the importance of reflective
observation about the exercise (Kolb, 1976, 1984; Fox and Ronkowski,
1997; Brock and Cameron, 1999). On a more practical level, debriefing
can provide necessary closure and encourage students toward further
discoveries.

[The [**study** of **ethical dilemmas** in **foreign policy**]{.mark}
can achieve **important educational objectives** in courses on
international relations]{.underline}. First, [ethical dilemmas can be
used to [illustrate]{.mark} the [**complexities** of]{.mark}
contemporary **[global politics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Perennial
themes like [the struggle for]{.mark} **state
[sovereignty]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[identity]{.underline}, [and
**globalization**]{.underline} [may be viewed
through]{.underline}]{.mark} [the optic of [ethical
debates]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second, collaborative learning projects
with defined objectives allow students to explore many avenues in
relating theories to case studies in a highly systematic format.
[[Debates with **assigned roles**]{.mark} also [provide students]{.mark}
with **greater [understanding]{.mark}** [of **diverse
perspectives**]{.mark} on major issues]{.underline}. [[They
learn]{.mark} more [about]{.mark} the [**background** and
**orientation** of **key players**]{.mark}]{.underline} [involved in
political discourse]{.underline}, and [[this may]{.mark} promote a
**[widen]{.mark}**ing of their **[worldviews]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Finally, [students can increase their **communications
skills**]{.underline} [through interactions with their peers in the
context of **structured debates**]{.underline}. These and other
objectives are described in practical application below.

#### Interpersonal and international conflicts are [analogous]{.underline} -- they share [structure]{.underline} and [mechanisms for resolution]{.underline} because they are both defined by [pursuit of incompatible goals]{.underline} -- debate's key to [resolving those disputes]{.underline}

[[**Conflict** is experienced at **all levels** of **human
activity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the
[diversity in level]{.mark}]{.underline} ([[from **interpersonal to
international**]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[and
intensity]{.underline}]{.mark} ([[from **minor disagreements**

**[[wars]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [[there are **common
insights**]{.underline} [and **approaches** to
**understanding**]{.underline}]{.mark} [the nature of [**conflict** and
**managing it**]{.mark} **peacefully**]{.underline}.

In its simplest form, [[conflict refers to]{.mark} the **[pursuit of
incompatible goals]{.mark}** by individuals or groups]{.underline}. In
other words, conflict situations arise when individuals or groups
identify a goal they want to secure in order to satisfy material
interests, needs or values. [[When]{.underline}]{.mark} these
[[perceptions lead to actions]{.mark} that come up [against]{.mark} the
[interests]{.mark}]{.underline}, [needs [and values of
others]{.mark}]{.underline}, [a [conflict]{.mark} dynamic
[occurs]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} definition
[[suggests a]{.underline}]{.mark} broader span of time and a [**[wider
class of struggle]{.underline}** [than **just armed
conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The use of such a broad definition
allows for the consideration of any conflict, **[whether]{.mark}** it is
**[interpersonal or international]{.mark}**]{.underline}, whether it is
[[pursued]{.mark} [by peaceful means or]{.mark}]{.underline} by the use
of [[force]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Armed conflict is a narrower category, denoting conflicts whereby
parties on both sides resort to the use of force. It is difficult to
define, as it includes situations ranging from a military overflight, an
attack on a civilian by a single soldier, or an all-out war with massive
casualties. Violent conflict or deadly conflict is similar to armed
conflict, but it also includes one-sided violence, for example, genocide
against unarmed civilians. It also encompasses the broader peace
research concept of violence that includes exploitative social relations
that cause unnecessary suffering (that is, structural violence).
Contemporary conflict refers to the prevailing pattern of political and
violent conflicts in the post-Cold War world, while contemporary armed
conflict refers to those that involve the use of force.

3\. Conflict Structure and Dynamics

[[Conflicts are complex]{.mark} processes]{.underline}. [[However, **all
conflict situations** have]{.mark} certain **[basic elements in
common]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [One way of conceptualising the
relationship between these]{.underline} elements [is [a **"conflict
triangle"**]{.mark}]{.underline} (illustrated in Diagram 2-2), [[with
**structures**]{.mark}, **[attitudes]{.mark}**, [and
**behaviours**]{.mark}]{.underline} [at the points]{.underline}.
[**[Galtung]{.underline}** [first proposed]{.underline}]{.mark} [this
model for understanding conflict]{.underline}.

- **[[Structures]{.underline}]{.mark}** [refer to the **political
  [mechanisms]{.mark}**, **[processes]{.mark}**, [and **institutions**
  that influence]{.mark} the [satisfaction of security]{.mark}, welfare,
  [recognition and identity needs]{.mark}]{.underline}.

- **[[Attitudes]{.underline}]{.mark}** [include the parties'
  [**perceptions** and **misperceptions** of **each other** and]{.mark}
  of **[themselves]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [These may be positive or
  negative]{.underline}, but in violent conflict parties tend to develop
  increasingly negative stereotypes of the other and an increasingly
  positive selfgroup identity. [Attitudes are often influenced by
  emotions such as fear, anger, bitterness and hatred]{.underline}.

- **[[Behaviours]{.underline}]{.mark}** [are **[actions]{.mark}**
  undertaken by one party in conflict [aimed at the opposing party
  with]{.mark} the [intention of making that party]{.mark} abandon or
  **[change its goals]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [It includes
  **coop**]{.underline}]{.mark}[eration and
  **[coercion]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[**gestures signifying
  conciliation** or **hostility**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Violent conflict
  behaviour is characterised by threats, coercion and destructive
  attacks.

[[Conflict is]{.mark} a [dynamic]{.mark} process in which structures,
[attitudes and behaviours are **constantly changing** and **influencing
one another**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A [conflict emerges as parties'
**interests come into conflict** or the **relationship**]{.underline}
they are in [becomes **oppressive**]{.underline}. [Conflict parties then
begin to **develop hostile attitudes** and **conflictual
behaviour**]{.underline}. The conflict formation starts to grow and
develop. As it does so, the [[conflict may
**widen**]{.underline}]{.mark} ([drawing in other parties]{.underline}),
**[[deepen]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([becoming more
protracted]{.underline} and possibly violent), [[and
**spread**]{.underline}]{.mark} (generating secondary conflicts within
the main parties or among outsiders). [This complicates the task of
addressing the original, core conflict]{.underline}.
[[Eventually]{.mark}, [resolving]{.mark} the [conflict must involve a
set of]{.mark} **dynamic**]{.underline}, [**[interdependent
changes]{.underline}** [that involve
**de-escalation**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of **conflict
behaviour**]{.underline}, [**[change in attitudes]{.underline}**, [and
**transformation** of **relationships**]{.underline}]{.mark} [or
structures]{.underline}.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} term ['[security
dilemma']{.mark}]{.underline} describes a familiar predicament
experienced by decision-makers in a world already overflowing with
dilemmas. Despite its ubiquity, our claim is that the concept has been
invariably misconceived by academic theorists, yet - properly
understood - it [[should be regarded as the **most fundamental**]{.mark}
concept of **all** in sec**urity studies**]{.underline}, and as such
should be at the centre of a reformed agenda of this field.1 [[The
security dilemma is]{.mark} a **[foundational]{.mark}** concept
[because]{.mark}]{.underline}, above all, [[it engages with the
**existential condition** of **uncertainty** that characterizes **all
human relations**]{.underline}, [not least]{.underline}]{.mark} [those
interactions on the biggest and most violent stage of all -
[international]{.mark} politics]{.underline}. That its significance has
not been properly recognized has been the result of orthodox thinking
failing to give due credit to the work and insights of its major early
theorists (John H. Herz and Herbert Butterfield, and later Robert
Jervis) and at the same time missing the opportunity (as a result of
paradigm blinkers) to appreciate the extent of the theoretical and
practical horizons it opens up. Our claim is that an understanding of
the dynamics and potentialities involved in thinking about the security
dilemma gets to the heart of the central questions of security studies
more profoundly than do even the traditional canon of concepts such as
'war', 'strategy', 'conflict' and the rest.

The house of uncertainty

[By describing uncertainty [as the 'existential' condition]{.mark} of
human relations we mean that [it is]{.mark} **not** an
**occasional**]{.underline} and passing **[phenomenon]{.underline}**,
[but]{.underline} rather [[an **everyday part** of]{.mark} the
[**existence** of **individuals and groups**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is
uneven in its significance and how it is felt, but [[it is]{.mark}
ultimately **[inescapable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Insecurity, however,
cannot be simply correlated with uncertainty, since uncertainty is a
house in which there are many rooms, and in some life is much less
insecure than in others. [[It is preferable to live
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[uncertainties]{.underline}]{.mark} of
what Kenneth Boulding (1979) called 'stable peace'
[[than]{.underline}]{.mark} with the insecurities of Stanley Hoffmann's
(1965) condition of'state of [[war]{.underline}']{.mark}. [[When
states]{.underline}]{.mark} practise
**[[coop]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration, or societies even embed trust in
security communities, [[significant]{.mark} degrees of [security are
attained, even within]{.mark}]{.underline} the house of
[[uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[In the context of **I**nternational **R**elations]{.underline}, [the
existential condition of uncertainty means]{.underline} that
[[governments]{.underline}]{.mark} (their decision-makers, military
planners, foreign policy analysts) [[can never be 100 per cent certain
about]{.mark} the current and future [motives]{.mark} and intentions [of
those able to harm them]{.mark}]{.underline} in a military sense. [[We
call this]{.mark} situation one of **[unresolvable
uncertainty]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and see it as the **core** of the
predicaments that make up the **security dilemma**]{.underline}.

The drivers of unresolvable uncertainty are multiple, but they can be
reduced to the combination of material and psychological phenomena, and
primarily the ambiguous symbolism of weapons and the psychological
dynamic philosophers call the other minds problem. Together, these
create the conditions for the concept first theorized by Herz (1951) and
Butterfield (1951). [Students of **disarm**ament are familiar
with]{.underline} the strategic meaning of the idea of the ambiguous
symbolism of weapons, if not this actual label. The term refers to the
[difficulty]{.underline} (many would say the impossibility) [of safely
distinguishing between 'offensive' and 'defensive' weapons]{.underline}.
As the old adage has it, whether you regard a gun as defensive or
offensive depends on whether or not you have your finger on the trigger.
This subjective interpretation, in principle, is the same in
international politics, though in practice it is more complex. If, for
example, it is argued that it is possible to distinguish between what is
clearly offensive (a sword) from what is clearly defensive (a shield)
with respect to individual weapons, strategists are likely to reply,
unanimously, that such distinctions are operationally meaningless when
interpreted as a whole, because a shield can be a vital part of an
offensive move when used in combination with a sword.

[Such an understanding has informed Russian, Chinese and other strategic
planners in their interpretation of various plans for US **ballistic
missile** 'shields' over the years]{.underline}. In the early
twenty-first century, the Administration of George W. Bush attempted to
justify deploying missile defence systems with the argument that they
would help protect the US homeland against limited missile attack from
'rogue states' in general, and crucially Iran and North Korea in
particular. Washington's critics (in potential target countries and
elsewhere)claimed to the contrary that the shield of missile defence can
potentially be used in combination with the sword of US offensive
nuclear missiles in a disarming strike against their enemies at some
point in the future. The domestic critics of such a deployment in the
USA for this reason see the move as destabilizing. 'What is not a weapon
in the wrong hands?' is the question delegates at the World Disarmament
Conference asked themselves in the early 1930s.

[[The]{.mark} closely related [second dimension]{.mark} of unresolvable
uncertainty [is the **other minds problem**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This
refers to]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [**inability** of]{.mark} the
**[decision-makers]{.mark}** of one state [ever to **get fully into the
minds** of]{.mark} their **[counterparts]{.mark}** in other
states]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} so **[fully
understand]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[their
**motives**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
**[[intentions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[hopes]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and **[[fears]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and **[emotions]{.underline}**
[[and **feelings**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Obviously, [some degree of
understanding]{.underline}, sympathy, and (even) empathy [is usually
possible]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} when it comes to matters of
national security, the [degree of confidence required by national
security planners has to be very high]{.underline}, [since the cost of
getting it wrong is never trivial]{.underline}. A serious misjudgement
could result in a waste of money and loss of prestige through the
pursuit of bad policies; ultimately, defeat in war and foreign
occupation might be the outcome.

#### Even abstract concepts like [negotiating]{.underline} between the US and Russia provides a [template]{.underline} for studying [human interactions]{.underline} and [negotiating self-interest]{.underline} -- even if it doesn't [solve conflict]{.underline}, studying IR helps break down the [impulse]{.underline} for [rightness vs. transgression]{.underline} dichotomies which characterized [both]{.underline} interpersonal [hostility]{.underline} and [global war]{.underline}

Research into the psychology of control has revealed that control needs
are key elements of individual psychological functioning. [[This
paper]{.underline}]{.mark} argues that a "need for control'' framework
is also useful for understanding actions and ideologies at the national
and international levels. It [[critically analyzes]{.mark} prevalent
[strategies for **exerting control**]{.mark}]{.underline} in this domain
[and [proposes alternative strategies]{.mark} which permit greater
fulfillment of control needs]{.underline}. [These [alternatives emerge
from an **examination**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark}
potential [**[similarities]{.mark}** [between **satisfaction
of**]{.mark} **control [needs]{.mark}** with[in]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[**separate** but **parallel**]{.mark} **domains**]{.underline} [of
**[international]{.mark} relations** [and **interpersonal
relations**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Political psychology has]{.mark} the [potential to
**translate**]{.mark} [issues]{.mark} of **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations]{.underline} [[into]{.mark} the [**terms** of
**human interpersonal encounte**]{.mark}**r**]{.underline}. In my view,
[[such]{.mark} a translation [**enhances** our **ability** to **think
creatively**]{.mark}]{.underline} about the current world situation.

The [[students in my]{.underline}]{.mark} freshman psychology
[[course]{.underline}]{.mark} recently surprised me by adopting this
approach for an in-class assignment. [[I]{.underline}]{.mark} had
[[asked]{.underline} [them to **role-play**]{.underline}]{.mark} [a
**[negotiating]{.mark}** session [between the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark} the [**Soviet Union** on]{.mark} the
issue of **[arms control]{.mark}**]{.underline}. My assumption had been
that they would act out the roles of political leaders on both sides,
and would proceed by exchanging official positions on arms control
issues. Instead, [[they took the view]{.mark}point [of]{.mark} ordinary
Ameri-can and Soviet [citizens]{.mark} and exchanged candid
remarks]{.underline} concerning their feelings about the nuclear danger.

Their tone of earnest sincerity was in stark contrast to the kind of
elaborate posturing, deceitfulness, and strategic "positioning" that
usually characterizes this kind of endeavor at the diplomatic level.
Having translated the arms race into its smallest constituent
parts---the feelings of individual Soviet and American citizens---they
had stripped away the layers of pretense and revealed the rigidly
arbitrary nature of their country's "party line." After the role-play
had ended, the students pressed me to admit that, if the political and
military leaders on both sides were removed from the picture, much of
the current conflict between the two countries could be settled by a
consensus of common citizens from both sides.

It only occurred to me later that, regardless of the practicality of
their solution, my class had arrived at it by a highly unusual means:
[[They]{.mark} had [asserted]{.mark} that the [**problems** were
**amenable to human control** by acknowledging]{.mark} their own
[**individual human reactions** to]{.mark} the dangers of continued
**[international confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I choose to focus
here not on the solution my students proposed but on the impulse behind
their proposal. The need expressed by these students to render these
issues "controllable" in some fashion is a basic one. Perhaps an
examination of this need, and the more vs. less healthy ways it can be
satisfied, holds the key to a novel approach to international relations.

The concept of a "need for control" has recently received much attention
within the field of psychology. The belief that one can exercise control
over one's outcomes is said to be critical to psychological well-being
(Glass and Singer, 1972; Langer, 1983; Seligman, 1975; Wortman and
Brehm, 1975). Research has shown that the negative consequences of a
stressful event on physical and mental health can be overcome by a sense
of control---i.e., a belief in one's ability to cope with (respond
effectively to) the event (Anderson, 1982; Langer and Rodin, 1976;
Perlmuter and Monty, 1979; Weiss, 1972). The accumulating body of
research in this area has promising applications for the restoration and
maintenance of psychological health in a wide range of human
environmental settings.

To date, feelings of control have been studied as an attribute of
individual psychological functioning. However, the recent work of Fred
Rothbaum and John Weisz and their colleagues (Rothbaum et al., 1982;
Weisz et al., 1984) suggests that a "need for control" analysis may also
be useful for understanding the functioning of individual nations within
the international arena. Rothbaum et al. distinguish between primary and
secondary forms of control. Primary control is the ability to enhance
one's rewards by doing something to influence existing realities (e.g.,
other people, circumstances). In secondary control, rewards are obtained
by accommodating to existing realities and maximizing satisfaction with
things as they are.

In other words, people attempt to gain control not only by bringing the
environment into line with their wishes (primary control) but also by
bringing themselves into line with environmental forces (secondary
control). Weisz et al. argue that cultures differ in the extent to which
they emphasize primary vs. secondary forms of control. They conclude
that the proper relation between the two forms of control involves a
dynamic interplay between them, and warn that too heavy an emphasis on
either primary or secondary control may be maladaptive for cultures as
well as individuals.

Extending the logic of Weisz et al. to the realm of international
relations, it can be assumed that [[**citizens** and **policymakers
alike** define]{.mark} the [**requirements** of **national
self-interest** in]{.mark} somewhat [the **same terms** they use to
evaluate]{.mark} their own **[individual]{.mark} sense of
[well-being]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, there is widespread
agreement that a key element of a "healthy" American psyche is a sense
of national potency ("primary control," in our terms) in the
international arena. Ronald Reagan's Presidency has been lauded by both
supporters and detractors for its "restoration" of this sense of control
after the "humiliating" decade of the 1970s---a legacy of Vietnam, the
oil embargo, and the Iranian hostage crisis (cf. Yankelovich, 1982).
Whether or not such a felt sense of control (or lack of same) would be
sustained by an objective appraisal, it is nonetheless real if it has
real consequences for domestic political priorities and foreign policy
actions.

Given the present context of international relations, is an enhanced
sense of control by one nation purchased at the expense of diminished
control by other nations? \[The Weisz et al. analysis does not attempt
to address this key issue.\] Under what conditions can this zero-sum
notion of control be overcome? If the attainment of a sense of control
is indeed an important objective within the world community, then these
questions are critical.

[The answer may lie in exploring **alternative strategies** for
attaining **[primary control]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [the
prevailing strategy requires nations to **maximize their power** vis a
vis **potential adversaries**]{.underline}. [Yet the **sense of
control** thus attained [is **always tenuous**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[because]{.underline} (a) [the tech]{.underline}nological [basis for
maintaining]{.underline} such [relative power may be eclipsed by
breakthroughs]{.underline} on the other side, (b) such technology is
subject to dissemination to third parties, thus diluting the power of
its former owners, and (c) power that involves the domination of one
nation by another (either directly or through surrogates) is bound to be
resisted by those subject peoples whose own needs for control have been
thwarted. Numerous examples attest to the existence of these needs
(under the guise of "nationalism" and "self-determination" or
"revolution" and "rebellion"---depending on the orientation of the
describer) as a continued source of frustration for the great powers in
their attempts to maintain the stability of client states.

[Faced with these difficulties of asserting primary control, both [the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark} the [**Soviet
Union** have come to rely]{.mark} heavily [on]{.mark}]{.underline} a
form of secondary control that Weisz et al. refer to as **[[interpretive
control]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This is [the attempt to **interpret
events**]{.mark} so as [to **derive**]{.mark} a sense of
**[meaning]{.mark} and purpose** from them]{.underline}. In the current
great power struggle, [[this assumes the form of **rigidly ideological
beliefs** about the]{.mark} **nature** of the **["other side'']{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} the [**necessity** of **continued
struggle**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It allows **individual persons** and
**actions** to be **subsumed** under a **"grand scheme"** of]{.mark}
impersonal global forces]{.underline} (e.g., **[["good" vs.
"evil"]{.underline}]{.mark}**). The interpretive route to control works
to the extent that it provides a reassuring sense of order and
predictability. However, [[this]{.mark} [**unifying vision** is
**purchased** at]{.mark} the [**expense** of]{.mark} an [**empirically
based analysis** of what the **rest of the world** is doing and
**why**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Reality]{.mark} [is
distorted]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to fit the **dichotomy of
rightness**]{.underline}]{.mark} (on one's own behalf) **[[vs.
transgression]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The selective "management" of information about foreign policy successes
vs. failures is essential to this enterprise \[the U.S. invasion of
Grenada provides a recent example; see e.g., Middleton (1984) and Nelson
(1983)\]. Unfortunately, such selective information-gathering seriously
impairs foreign policy. Numerous authors have described occasions on
which great powers have become the captives of their own over-simplified
world views (e.g., Didion, 1983; Tuchman, 1984; Sick, 1985).

Extended use of this secondary control strategy requires a blurring of
the distinction between international politics and fiction. The Soviet
Union does not enjoy a monopoly in this regard. Within the last year,
the Vietnam War veteran has been resurrected as an American hero, and
American audiences have eagerly imbibed his cinematic revenge against
the North Vietnamese in "Rambo," "Missing in Action," and their
television counterparts.

A related phenomenon is the president's identification with the
on-screen personas of fellow actors Clint Eastwood and Sylvester
Stallone, whose adherence to simplified credos belie the gnawing
complexities of value choices in the real world. Such reactions are
likely not unique to Americans or to their current president. Instead,
they are symptomatic of the frustrations incurred by nations who have
failed in their attempts to exert active control over world events.

The control needs themselves are legitimate; the strategies that are
currently employed for satisfying those needs are not. Use of such
measures guarantees that the cycle will repeat itself---i.e., that
unrealistic thinking and erroneous judgment will serve as the basis for
future foreign policy actions.

The question remains: If the nations of the world cannot afford
continued reliance on such an ineffective (and unbalanced) "mix" of
control strategies, what are the alternatives? As suggested above, the
answer lies in exploring alternative conceptions of "control." Rather
than conceiving of control as a subject-object relationship, in which
the "object" is a fixed quantity (of land, resources, subject
populations) to be apportioned among contending powers, one could
instead consider it in the context of a subject-subject relationship, a
dy-namic system in which control needs are realized by the exercise of
mutual influence.

[[An **analogy** between]{.mark} the realms of **[international]{.mark}
relations** [and **interpersonal relations**]{.mark} may serve to
[illustrate this]{.mark} distinction]{.underline}. [In [a **personal
relationship** that is **subject-object-based**]{.mark}, [each]{.mark}
party [has]{.mark} a **[mutually exclusive]{.mark} sphere** of
**[self-interest]{.mark}**]{.underline} ("turf") [to be
protected]{.underline}; [[the **relationship** must be **negotiated**
on]{.mark} the basis of [how much turf each]{.mark} party [will
cede]{.mark} to the other in exchange for similar
consideration]{.underline}. [A **[failure of negotiation]{.mark}** may
[lead to **unilateral attempts**]{.mark} by either/both parties to grab
some of the other's turf]{.underline}. [**"[Compromise"]{.mark}** [and
**"confrontation"**]{.mark} thus **[define]{.mark}** the parameters of
[this]{.mark} type of [relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[**Alternatively**, a personal relationship may be
**subject-subject-based**]{.mark}, to the extent that [the relationship
is not]{.mark} primarily [directed toward]{.mark} the issue of [sharing
vs. hoarding]{.mark}]{.underline} (of a separate domain of
self-interest) [[but]{.mark} rather toward a [redefinition of self and
self-interest]{.mark} in terms of the relationship]{.underline}.
[Satisfaction]{.underline} in such a relationship is not derived from
the amount of turf seized from, or conceded by, the other party. Instead
it [obtains from the opportunity to exert positive influence over the
other's outcomes]{.underline}, and in turn to be the beneficiary of the
other's positive consideration and favorable regard (cf. Kelley, 1979;
Kelley and Thi-baut, 1978).

Starting next week and through October, President Barack Obama and Gov.
Mitt Romney will face off in a series of four televised debates,
designed to clarify the candidates' positions on the most pressing
public policy issues confronting the nation today. In place of the
ideals and elegant rhetoric of the campaign trail, the leaders of the
two major parties will have an opportunity to describe the nitty-gritty
of governing: how they will deal with complex matters like affordable
health care, foreign policy in the Middle East, job creation, equitable
taxation, and more.

But [the unfortunate reality is that **Americans** won't get much in the
way of detail and explanation]{.underline}. If history is any guide, the
[[debate moderators]{.mark} will [not press very hard for nuts and
bolts]{.mark}, instead]{.underline} allowing the candidates to evade and
attack and [talk in unhelpful generalities. They will [**preach in
pre-tested catch phrases** to the already converted **rather
than**]{.mark} **really [explaining]{.mark} the difficult day-to-day
realities of decision** making]{.underline} in a democracy.

Cynics will say that it doesn't matter, that voters' minds are made up
anyway. But if national debates aren't the venue for challenging
citizens' thinking, then what is? [Voters need to understand [the
**prosaic details of complex policies**]{.mark}. Most have staked out
positions on these issues, but they are not often reasoned positions,
which take hard intellectual work.]{.underline} Most citizens opt
instead for simplistic explanations, assuming wrongly that they
comprehend the nuances of issues.

[Psychological scientists have a name for this easy, automatic,
simplistic thinking: the illusion of explanatory depth. [We strongly
believe that we understand complex matters, when]{.mark} in fact **[we
are clueless]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and these false and extreme beliefs
shape our preferences, judgments, and actions --- including our votes.

[Is it possible [to shake]{.mark} such [deep-rooted
convictions]{.mark}?]{.underline} That's the question that Philip
Fernbach, [a **psychological scientist at the University of Colorado's**
Leeds School of Business,]{.underline} wanted to explore. Fernbach and
his colleagues wondered if [**[forcing people to explain complex
policies in detail]{.mark}** --- not cheerleading for a position but
really [considering the mechanics of implementation]{.mark} --- might
[force them to confront their ignorance]{.mark} and]{.underline} thus
[weaken their extremist stands on issues. They ran a series of lab
experiments to test this idea.]{.underline}

They started by recruiting a group of volunteers in their 30s ---
Democrats, Republicans, and Independents --- and asking them to state
their positions on a variety of issues, from a national flat tax to a
cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions. They indicated how strongly
the felt about each issue and also rated their own understanding of the
issues. Then the volunteers were instructed to write elaborate
explanations of two issues. If the issue was cap and trade, for example,
they would first explain precisely what cap and trade means, how it is
implemented, whom it benefits and whom it could hurt, the sources of
carbon emissions, and so forth. They were not asked for value judgments
about the policy or about the environment or business, but only for a
highly detailed description of the mechanics of the policy in action.

Let's be honest: [Most of us never do this]{.underline}. Fernbach's
[idea was that such an exercise would force many to realize just how
little they really know]{.underline} about cap and trade, and confronted
with their own ignorance, they would dampen their own enthusiasm. [They
would]{.underline} [be humbled and as a result take less extreme
positions]{.underline}. And that's just what happened.
[Trying]{.underline} --- and failing --- [to explain complex policies
undermined the extremists' illusions about being
well-informed]{.underline}. They became more moderate in their views as
a result.

[[Being forced to articulate the nuts and bolts]{.mark} of a policy
[is]{.mark} not the same as trying to sell that policy]{.underline}. In
fact, talking about one's views can often strengthen them. Fernbach
believes [it's **[the slow, cognitive work]{.mark} --- the [deliberate
analysis]{.mark} --- [that changes people's
judgments]{.mark}**,]{.underline} but he wanted to check this in another
experiment. This one was very similar to the first, but some volunteers,
instead of explaining a policy, merely listed reasons for liking it.
Consider universal health care, for example: It's highly complex and
challenging to explain, but much easier to label it "compassionate" or,
alternatively, "European" or "socialist." So some volunteers were
assigned to do the hard explaining and others the simplistic labeling.

The results were clear. As described in a forthcoming issue of the
journal Psychological Science, [[those who **simply**]{.mark} listed
reasons for their positions --- [**articulating** their **values** ---
were **less shaken**]{.mark} in their views]{.underline}. They continued
to think they understood the policies in their complexity, and, notably,
they remained extreme in their passion for their positions. In a final
version of the study, volunteers who were forced to confront their
inadequate knowledge actually gave less money to the cause, suggesting
that with their extremism attenuated, they actually acted more
moderately.

[Americans in 2012 are about as polarized and partisan as they've ever
been, and such polarization tends to reinforce itself. People are
unaware of their own ignorance, and they seek out information that
bolsters their views,]{.underline} often without knowing it. They also
process new information in biased ways, and they hang out with people
like themselves. All of these [psychological forces increase political
extremism, and no simple measure will change that. But]{.underline}
forcing the candidates to [provide concrete and elaborate plans might be
a start]{.underline}; it gives citizens a starting place. As former
presidential hopeful Ross Perot famously stated, "[The devil is in the
details."]{.underline}

#### Predictable limits are critical to issue specialization\-\--opening discussion to every important issue simultaneously causes cognitive overstretch and undermines the educational potential of debate to loosen elites monopoly on expertise

Kevin J. **Elliott 19**, Assistant Professor of Political Science at
Murray State University, 11/14/19, "Democracy\'s Pin Factory: Issue
Specialization, the Division of Cognitive Labor, and Epistemic
Performance," American Journal of Political Science,
<https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12486>

[In this article, I present an [underappreciated mechanism of collective
wisdom]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[by which cognitively average
individuals]{.mark} can, taken [as a group, **make better decisions
than**]{.mark} **even [the smartest ]{.mark}**[and most informed
**citizens**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [individually]{.underline} or in
small groups1---[[based on **issue specialization** through
**deliberative enclaves**]{.mark} **called "issue
publics."**]{.underline} Though this epistemic mechanism does not
entirely answer the epistemic challenge, it responds to it in the same
instrumental terms in which it is put and [avoids appeals to
democracy\'s intrinsic worth]{.underline}, which critics might view as
evading the question. I hope that issue specialization enters the debate
over the wisdom of democracy alongside promising epistemic mechanisms
like diversity. I also aim to show that issue specialization is a
promising subject for renewed empirical investigation since topics
discussed here, such as the specialization of citizens' political
knowledge, need more study.2

It must be emphasized, however, that this mechanism is broadly Hayekian
in its operation, rather than Condorcetian; it does not promise right
answers but rather helps inform decisions by gathering information
widely dispersed in society. My modest claim is therefore that [issue
specialization makes]{.underline} democratic [choices more
informed]{.underline}, not that it makes democracy "truth tracking" or
leads to optimal decisions. At best, it [may eliminate some of the worst
options by defining a broad top set among which informed citizens
disagree.]{.underline} Like diversity, [issue specialization **[does not
render bad policy impossible but]{.mark} merely [less
likely.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Because [this article engages deeply [with empirical
evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}, I must clarify the status of the claims I
make. One might wonder, for instance, whether I use the evidence to
contend that issue specialization through issue publics is something
that currently happens in democracies or whether it is an aspiration
that could improve democratic performance after reform. My response is
both. It is generally agreed that issue publics (which instantiate issue
specialization) exist at least to some degree, but not necessarily to
the extent required to generate the epistemic performance I suggest.
This makes issue specialization both something that can potentially
explain the excellent performance of many democracies today, as well as
a realistic ideal toward which we might aspire. I therefore highlight
how existing evidence is consistent with or positively supports issue
publics, with the main purpose of illustrating the conditional claim
that if we made issue specialization more central to our expectations of
citizenship and democracy, the potential exists for it to do good
epistemic work.

The Cognitive Division of Labor in Democracy

In Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith claims that the specialization of tasks
in an economic division of labor allows for great advances in
productivity and the alleviation of scarcity (Smith 2008). In this
section, I analogize Smith\'s claims to issue specialization in a
division of the cognitive labor involved in making democratic decisions
and argue that [issue specialization generates an epistemic advantage
for large groups over smaller ones, even if the latter are made up of
the smartest or most competent individuals.]{.underline}

Consider the task facing citizens trying to make democratic
decisions---that is, [[decisions about what policies to
enact]{.underline}]{.mark} or who should have political power. This is
[[conventionally understood to require]{.mark} citizens to consider and
**[learn about every possible issue, figure out]{.mark} what [the
best]{.mark} policy is [regarding each issue,]{.mark}** [and then trade
off]{.mark} those policies against each other [to construct an optimal
political program]{.mark}]{.underline} [(]{.mark}Beerbohm 2012). Then,
in representative democracies, citizens must further consider which
party or candidate most closely matches that program, bearing in mind
that further trade‐offs are often necessary since none are likely to be
a perfect match.

This [[presents]{.mark} citizens with [an **immensely complex
task**]{.mark}]{.underline}, akin to an individual manufacturing, say, a
modern car. But, like making a car, the difficulty of the task can be
alleviated by breaking it up into smaller pieces, just as in Smith\'s
pin factory. Democracy\'s pin factory, I argue, is found in breaking up
and specializing the task of democratic choice through issue
specialization and, to a lesser extent, by functional differentiation.

Issue specialization is the first and most powerful element of this
division of labor (Beerbohm 2012, 180--81; Elkins 1993).3 If we use a
spatial metaphor and think of all the potential issues on the political
agenda as occupying space on a landscape, then [[issue
specialization]{.underline}]{.mark} operates by dividing that space into
limited parcels corresponding to specific issues and having particular
groups attend to each area. This [[vastly simplifies]{.mark} the task of
coming to [informed decisions]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lupia 2006, 227).
[**Instead of becoming informed about every possible issue** and trading
off between them, [members of each specialized group]{.mark} need only
[become informed about a single area ]{.mark}]{.underline}and make their
decisions on the merits of that issue.

This specialization also allows members of these groups to develop a
kind of issue expertise through surveillance of news and familiarity
with the facts, organizations, and coalitions surrounding it.4 This is
analogous to the dexterity Smith argues workers develop through the
economic division of labor. In particular, specialized citizens are
likely to have identified trustworthy groups or individuals from whom to
take informational cues, reducing the costs of staying informed (Lupia
1994). This expertise enables them to do a better job than others at
judging the performance or promises of candidates on that issue.

Likewise, by concentrating on limited issue areas, citizens gain issue
focus, which eliminates the costs of following every twist and turn of
political events and learning about entirely new issues every few weeks.
This is analogous to the elimination of changeover costs from one task
to another highlighted by Smith. Issue focus also alleviates worries of
activist fatigue arising from being pulled in several directions at once
by a fragmented political agenda. Finally, [by specializing and
focusing, citizens are able to make maximally **[efficient use of the
limited time, attention, and resources]{.mark}** they can devote to
politics,]{.underline} improving the "productivity" of their
"citizenship time."

The complexity of the task is further simplified by another division of
cognitive labor: functional differentiation. This is familiar in
democratic theory and consists in dividing labor between individuals
with different but complementary roles in a democratic system, in the
way that the functions of representatives, activists, journalists, and
ordinary citizens mutually complement each other (Christiano 2015;
Parkinson and Mansbridge 2012). In this way, the task facing ordinary
citizens is made even more tractable. Not only do they focus their
attention on a limited share of the overall issue space, but they also
share the burdens of surveilling and making decisions about that space
with others fulfilling different roles.

The two dimensions of divided labor work together, yet issue
specialization is primary. We can see this by imagining the functional
division of labor replicating itself within each of the specialized
issue areas, as activists, journalists, and citizens specialize by
issue, along with civil society. It may seem that functional
differentiation is doing the work, but it must be remembered that it
only comes into play on a field that has already been differentiated by
issue. Issue specialization easily falls out of notice because it
defines the ground over which first‐order political contestation occurs.
It tends to disappear into the background because we take it for granted
in any particular political debate. Though both kinds of division of
labor are at work, the main source of epistemic merit is the topical
division of labor that divides the decision task into limited parcels of
issues.

One question arising from the analogy between the economic and
democratic division of labor is this: What mechanism aggregates the
specialized work of these groups? In factories, aggregation happens
spontaneously because the output of each specialized worker serves as
input for the next step in production. But there is no obvious analogue
among groups attending to different issues. In this account, the main
agents of aggregation are representatives and political parties. As
discussed below, in seeking election and building coalitions, these
actors look to issue‐specialized groups for electoral support and for
information about the sorts of policies they should advocate. Thus,
aggregation mainly occurs through governing and competing to do so
(e.g., constructing electoral platforms).

If this account is correct, it creates a scalable advantage for mass
publics over individuals and small groups because they cannot specialize
in an analogous way. [Individuals must decide using only the scarce
attention and limited ability they individually possess]{.underline}.
Small groups can, of course, specialize---there are, after all,
Secretaries of Defense, Commerce, Education, and so on---but this
[specialization is severely limited by numbers and the broad diversity
of issues.]{.underline} **[[No matter how informed]{.mark} or
sophisticated [an individual or]{.mark} small [group is, they will
be]{.mark} importantly [blinkered by their inherent cognitive
limits]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [They [can only admit a finite number of
issues]{.mark} as important enough to command their direct attention. As
a result, [they will neglect many]{.mark} other [important
issues]{.mark}]{.underline}. A democratic public specialized by issue
faces no such limits. Mass publics can be endlessly subdivided such that
every issue has its specialists. Within this group of relative
specialists, moreover, there is a further division of labor along the
axis of functional complementarity, between ordinary citizens,
activists, experts, and so forth. Democracy thereby reaps epistemic
gains from specialization at a scale no individual or small group can
match.

[One might ask what is specifically democratic about this mechanism
since it might seem to be primarily about expertise and interest groups.
The answer is that **[ordinary citizens---not just elites---are
cultivating]{.mark} issue [expertise]{.mark}** and]{.underline} that it
is the openness of democratic processes of aggregation and deliberation
that mobilizes this [distributed expertise]{.underline}, whereas
nondemocratic or epistocratic institutions more closed to popular input
cannot.

#### The terminal impact is objectivity\-\--the value of critical social inquiry doesn't come from flashy labels or superficial inclusion, but from the hard work of providing correct explanations of the world\-\--reclaiming critical objectivity is crucial to undermine elite-driven ossification of social relations

[The '[common-sense' view]{.mark}]{.underline} pervading recent
discussions of epistemology, ontology and methodology [[in IR
asserts]{.mark} that [objectivity implies value-free
neutrality]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, [objective social inquiry has
an inherent tendency to be critical, in various senses. [To the
extent]{.mark} that **[objective knowledge provides a better]{.mark} and
more adequate [account of reality than other ideas]{.mark}**[, such
**knowledge is inherently critical**]{.mark}]{.underline} (implicitly or
explicitly[) of those ideas]{.underline}. 30 In other words [**[critical
social inquiry does not]{.mark}**]{.underline} (or not only)
[[**manifest** its 'criticalness' **through self-claimed labels of being
critical or siding with the oppressed**, but through]{.mark} the
[substantive critique]{.mark} of prevailing ideas.]{.underline}
Objective [social knowledge constitutes a specific form of criticism:
explanatory critique]{.underline}. [The **critique** [of dominant
ideas]{.mark} or ideologies is [elaborated **through providing a more
adequate explanation**]{.mark} of aspects of the world, **[and in so
doing exposing what is wrong]{.mark}** with the dominant
ideology]{.underline}. This may also entail revealing the social
conditions which give rise to ideologies, thus exposing the necessary
and causal relation between particular social relations and particular
ideological conceptions.

[In societies which are constituted by unequal structures of social
relations giving rise to unequal power and conflicting interests, the
reproduction of those structured relations is in the interests of the
powerful, whereas transformation of existing structured relations is in
the interests of the weak. [Because **ideas inform social
action**]{.mark} **they are casually efficacious** either in securing
the reproduction of existing social relations]{.underline} (usually as
an unintended consequence of social practice), or in informing social
action aimed at transforming social relations. This is why ideas cannot
be 'neutral'. [Ideas which provide a misrepresentation of the nature of
society, the causes of unequal social conditions, and the conflicting
interests of the weak and powerful]{.underline}, will tend to [help
secure the reproduction of prevailing social relations]{.underline}.
Ideas which provide a more adequate account of the way society is
structured and how structured social relations produce concrete
conditions of inequality and exploitation can potentially inform efforts
to change those social relations. In this sense, [**[ideas which are
false]{.mark}** are ideological and, in serving to [promote the
reproduction of the status quo and]{.mark} avoid attempts at radical
change, [**are in the interests of the powerful**.]{.mark} An account
which is objective will contradict ideological ideas, implicitly or
explicitly criticising them for their false or flawed accounts of
reality.]{.underline} The criticism here arises not, or not only, from
pointing out the coincidence between ideologies and the interests of the
powerful, nor from a prior normative stance of solidarity with the
oppressed, but from exposing the flaws in dominant ideologies through a
more adequate account of the nature and causes of social conditions 31.

A [normative [commitment to the oppressed must entail]{.mark} a
[commitment to truth and objectivity]{.mark}, because true ideas are in
the interest of the oppressed, false ideas are in the interest of the
oppressors.]{.underline} In other words, **[the best way to declare
solidarity with the oppressed is to declare one's commitment to
objective inquiry]{.underline}** 32 . As Nzongola-Ntalaja (1986: 10) has
put it:

It is a question of whether one analyses society from the standpoint of
the **[[dominant groups]{.underline}]{.mark}**, who [**[have a vested
interest in mystifying]{.mark}** the way **[society]{.mark}**
works]{.underline}, or from the standpoint of [[ordinary
people]{.underline}]{.mark}, who [[have nothing to lose from truthful
analyses]{.mark} of their predicament.]{.underline}

The philosophical realist theory of [science, objectivity and
explanatory critique thus provides an alternative response to the
relationship between knowledge and power]{.underline}. Instead of
choosing perspectives on the basis of our ethical commitment to the
cause of the oppressed and to emancipatory social change, we should
choose between contending ideas on the basis of which provides a better
account of objective social reality. [This will inherently provide a
critique of the ideologies which, by virtue of their flawed account of
the social world, serve the interests of the powerful.]{.underline}

Exemplars of [**[explanatory critique in I]{.mark}nternational
[R]{.mark}elations** are provided in the work of scholars such as Siba
Grovogui, James Gathii, Anthony Anghie, Bhupinder Chimni, Jacques
Depelchin, Hilbourne Watson, Robert Vitalis, Sankaran Krishna,
Michel-Rolph Trouillot]{.underline} 33 . Their work provides critiques
of central categories, theories and [discourses in the theory and
practice of IR and narratives of world history, **[including assumptions
about sovereignty]{.mark}, international society, [international law,
global governance, the nature of the state]{.mark}.**]{.underline} They
expose [the ideological and racialised nature of central aspects of
IR]{.underline} [[through a **critical examination of** both the long
**historical trajectory of imperial ideologies**]{.mark} regarding
colonized peoples]{.underline}, and the actual practices of colonialism
and [decolonisation in the constitution of international orders and
local social conditions]{.underline}. Their work identifies the flaws in
current ideas by revealing how they systematically misrepresent or
ignore the actual history of social change in Africa, the Caribbean and
other regions of the Third World, both past and present -- during both
colonial and neo-colonial periods of the imperial world order. [Their
[work reveals how racism, violence,]{.mark} exploitation and
dispossession, [colonialism]{.mark} and neo-colonialism [have been
central to the]{.mark} making of [contemporary international
order]{.mark} and contemporary [doctrines of international law]{.mark},
sovereignty and rights, and how such themes are glaring in their absence
from histories and theories of international relations and international
history.]{.underline}

Objective social knowledge which accurately depicts and explains social
reality has these qualities by virtue of its relation to its object, not
its subject. As Collier argues, "[The science/ideology distinction is an
epistemological one, not a social one]{.underline}." (Collier 1979: 60).
So, for example, in the work of Grovogui, Gathii and Depelchin, the
general perspective and knowledge of conditions in and the history of
Africa might be due largely to the African social origins of the
authors. However the judgement that their accounts are superior to those
of mainstream IR rests not on the fact that the authors are African, but
on the greater adequacy of their accounts with respect to the actual
historical and contemporary production of conditions and change in
Africa and elsewhere in the Third World. The criteria for choosing their
accounts over others derives from the relation between the ideas and
their objects (what they are about), not from the relation between the
ideas and their subjects (who produced them). It is vital to retain
explicitly some commitment to objectivity in social inquiry, to the
notion that the proper criterion for judging ideas about the world lies
in what they say about the world, not whose ideas they are.

A [fundamental problem which underlies the origin and reproduction of
IR's eurocentricity is]{.underline} the overwhelming dominance of ideas
produced in and by the west, and the wilful and [determined silencing of
the voices and histories of the colonised.]{.underline} But the result
of this [fundamental problem is flawed knowledge about the
world]{.underline}. Eurocentricity is therefore a dual problem
concerning both the authors and the content of knowledge, and [cannot be
resolved through normative commitments alone.]{.underline} It is not
only the voices of the colonised, but the histories of colonialism,
which have been glaring in their absence from the discipline of
International Relations.

[**[Overcoming eurocentricity]{.mark}** therefore
**[requires]{.mark}**]{.underline} not only concerted effort from the
centre to create space and listen to hitherto marginalised voices, but
also **[[commitment to correcting]{.mark} the [flaws in prevailing
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- and [it is [not only 'the Other'
who]{.mark} can and [should elaborate this]{.mark}
critique]{.underline}. A vitally important implication of objectivity is
that [[it is the responsibility of European]{.mark} and American, [just
as much as]{.mark} non-American or [non-European scholars, to
decolonise]{.mark} IR]{.underline}. The [importance of objectivity in
social inquiry defended here can perhaps be seen as a form of
epistemological internationalism. **It is [not necessary to be African
to ]{.mark}**[attempt to **tell a more accurate account of**]{.mark}
**the history of [Europe's role]{.mark}** [in the making of]{.mark} the
[contemporary Africa]{.mark} and the rest of the world, for example,
**or to write counter-histories of 'the expansion of international
society'** which detail the systematic barbarity of so-called Western
civilisation]{.underline}. It is not necessary to have been colonised to
recognise and document the violence, racism, genocide and dispossession
which have characterised European expansion over five hundred years.

#### It turns case\-\--the state intentionally creates seemingly radical, but politically bankrup leftist positions to discredit and undermine their positions\-\--being able to effectively analyse policies is key to prevent it

September 18, 2017. "Agents provocateurs and the manipulation of the
radical left."
<https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/agents-provocateurs-and-the-manipulation-of-the-radical-left/>

[History teaches us is that **[the ruling class]{.mark}**, the [state
and non-state institutions it controls, as well as the right]{.mark}
**have [learned]{.mark} the [political judo whereby the left's actions
may be turned around]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} used to **[strengthen the
right and weaken the left]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Specifically, [we
should learn from the history of the agent provocateur]{.underline}, a
specialist in manipulating conflict so as to benefit our
enemie[s]{.underline}. [Agents provocateurs are not merely]{.underline}
enemy [spies]{.underline} within the people's movement. The provocateur
[has an even more sinister mission]{.underline}, which sometimes has
deadly results. [What the provocateur frequently provokes is actions
that either discredit the left or the people's movement in the eyes of
large numbers of people, or which entrap the unwary into acts that will
allow police to pounce]{.underline}, accuse activists of plotting
violent or other anti-social acts, and then lock them up. [[Agents
provocateurs]{.mark} have been [known for well over a century]{.mark},
in many countries]{.underline}; the breed was especially rife in tsarist
Russia in the late 1800s and early 1900s. In the United States, agents
provocateurs often targeted labor union organizing efforts. Since the
end of the Second World War and the beginning of the Cold War, there are
many accounts of the FBI, other police bodies, the military, and private
right-wing vigilante groups sending agents provocateurs into people's
organizations with the purpose of dividing, disrupting, and discrediting
them and then laying them open to arrest and prosecution, or worse.

More radical than thou

In the 1960s and 1970s, there was a great outpouring of grassroots
rejection of the policies, domestic and international, of the Cold War.
The Civil Rights Movement, plus the movement against the Vietnam War,
brought millions into the streets protesting courageously against the
many injustices of our society. The Cold Warriors and the ruling class
did not like this, as they saw their interests threatened. So [they
developed open and [covert strategies for undermining]{.mark} the [new
radicalism]{.mark} as well as the "old left"]{.underline} (communists
and socialists). The [**idea was [to make sure that the left did
not]{.mark} continue to [win over the support of the mass of]{.mark} the
[people]{.mark}** of the United States to progressive and ultimately,
revolutionary, socialist ideas]{.underline}. The "new left" tendencies
that arose at this time included many positive features but had some
dangerous flaws also. One flaw was that too often, a fetish was made of
the absolute right of anybody involved in an organization to express his
or her opinion no matter how divergent from the main goals of the
organization, or to engage in any activity which was "radical"
regardless of whether it helped or harmed the cause. This extreme
liberalism laid many organizations open to manipulation of some of their
weakest elements by agents provocateurs. [There was also a tendency to
compete to see who was most radical. The **[competition for
revolutionary "cred" was a godsend for agents
provocateurs]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [who]{.underline}]{.mark}
[actively [encouraged such competition]{.mark}]{.underline}. The lack of
connections, especially among campus-based white radicals, to the
working class and its politics exacerbated this trend by eliminating an
important reality check.

Picking off leaders and undermining public support

There also tended to be a cult of leadership within many radical
organizations which put their leaders into a vulnerable position in
which they could be targeted for neutralization so as to undermine the
whole movement. J. Edgar Hoover's FBI, for instance, put a huge amount
of effort into neutralizing leaders. The [agents provocateurs were
deployed in such a way as to discredit the leaders and their
organizations, to create splits in the movement, and in some cases to
provoke violence which would lead to]{.underline} physical elimination
of leaders plus a [societal repudiation of the movement.]{.underline}
The 1960s campus-based movement against the Vietnam War was a top target
for agents provocateurs. There were several at work, but one, known as
["[Tommy the
Traveler](https://jeffsharletandvietnamgi.blogspot.com/2011/04/tommy-traveler.html)"
was particularly memorable]{.underline}. He, too, [**[concentrated on
enticing impressionable young]{.mark}** would-be "**[revolutionaries" to
commit acts that]{.mark} would [divide the movement]{.mark}** while
landing them in jail]{.underline}. Hoover, a crusading anti-communist
and paranoid racist, paid particular attention to disrupting the
[highly-effective](http://www.peoplesworld.org/article/want-to-punch-a-nazi-think-twice/)
African American people's movement, often employing agents provocateurs
to create friction within and between liberation organizations. [This
led to several murders.]{.underline} In 1967, for example, agents
provocateurs, especially a certain [William
O'Neal](https://www.thenation.com/article/was-fred-hampton-executed/),
described in a Nation article as "infatuated with weapons," played a
role in the police murder of Illinois Black Panther Party leaders Fred
Hampton and Mark Clark. Hampton had been suspicious of O'Neal because of
his violent talk, but others did not see through him, with tragic
results. O'Neal's promotion of crackpot violent schemes should have been
a giveaway. When O'Neal set up Hampton and Clark for a brutal murder by
police acting under the orders of Cook County State's Attorney Ed
Hanrahan, the perpetrators were able to convince sectors of the public
that the Panthers were prone to violence and shot first, which was
untrue. Another example was the crime of Cerro Maravilla, in Puerto
Rico, on July 25, 1978. An agent provocateur, [Alejandro González
Malavé](https://nacla.org/article/cerro-maravilla-deaths-police-cover-rock-puerto-rico),
working undercover for the Puerto Rican police, enticed two idealistic
young supporters of independence for Puerto Rico into a reckless act
that cost them their lives. One was Carlos Enrique Soto Areví, the son
of one of [[Puerto Rico's most important literary
figures]{.underline}]{.mark}, the novelist Pedro Juan Soto. The second
was a self-taught worker, Arnaldo Dario Rosado. [Both [were on fire with
indignation a]{.mark}t the [colonialist treatment]{.mark} that Puerto
Rico received]{.underline} at the hands of the United States (treatment
which continues today[). They [wanted to demonstrate]{.mark} this
indignation]{.underline} in some dramatic way. [Their [lack of practical
political experience made them easy prey]{.mark}]{.underline} for
González Malavé. [He **[persuaded them that a noble act]{.mark}** for
their homeland **[would be to destroy some communications
towers]{.mark}** on the top of a hill called "Cerro Maravilla." This
**[was supposed to express solidarity]{.mark}** with some imprisoned
Puerto Rican independence fighters]{.underline}. The three kidnapped a
taxi driver and forced him to drive them up to Cerro Maravilla. But when
they arrived, they found [they [had been led into a police
ambush]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the armed police approached, González
Malavé identified himself as an agent, but Soto and Rosado were killed,
and the "[official" story was put out that they had been shot in a
firefight with the cops]{.underline}. The [[right-wing]{.mark},
pro-statehood governor at the time,]{.underline} Carlos Romero Barceló,
[[hailed the police as heroes,]{.mark} and the [FBI helpfully pitched
in]{.mark} to support the Puerto Rican Justice Department [with the
cover-up]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} However, the police had left a
"loose end," namely the taxi driver, who spoke to the press and revealed
that in fact González Malavé was a police agent and that the two young
men were still alive when he left the place. The police had entrapped
the two men, then murdered them after they surrendered. This became a
big scandal, and eventually led to prosecutions and the defeat of Romero
Barceló's party in the next elections. But the use of agents
provocateurs to divide and isolate the Puerto Rican left has been
unrelenting, both before and after that incident.

Disrupting today's movements

[Such [agent provocateur tactics **surfaced again during**]{.mark} **the
protests against the [Iraq War, and in the "Occupy"]{.mark}
movement**]{.underline}. In each case, glib charismatic strangers wormed
their way into protest organizations, and then entrapped inexperienced
young radicals to get involved in plans, which were sometimes really
just talk, to engage in violence. A typical case is that of the
"[Cleveland bomb
plot](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/02/nation/la-na-nn-fbi-stings-20120502)"
of 2012. Another is the San Francisco [Mission District
riot](https://missionlocal.org/2012/05/occupysf-reacts-to-monday-nights-destruction-of-valencia/)
of May 2012, when a mysterious black-clad contingent hijacked part of a
peaceful "Occupy" demonstration and turned it toward random violence. In
both cases, [the purpose of the provocateurs was to discredit the
movement in the eyes of the public, which otherwise might have been
receptive to Occupy's "99 percent versus one percent" message. **This
[kind of manipulation still continues by all
account]{.mark}**]{.underline}[s]{.mark}. As before, [the purpose is [to
**discredit the movement, divide it, deprive it of allies**, and **set
up** leaders]{.mark} and **organizations [for repressive
action]{.mark}** [while making sure]{.mark} that this [repression will
not produce a wave of public indignation]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
happened with the Cerro Maravilla case. The right and the ruling class
always try to portray these people's movements as violent, because this
is the alchemy best suited to turn public opinion against them. This is
the main lesson to be learned from the agent provocateur experiences of
the past. In the conditions of our country today, injecting violent
tactics into the mass movement of protest undermines that movement and
plays the enemy's game. Loose talk about violence can be just as
dangerous. This [[danger is multiplied by]{.mark} the development of
online communications and [social media]{.mark}---there are no secrets
now.]{.underline} Hijacking other people's protest actions to "move them
to a higher level," meaning toward violent confrontations, is really a
dirty kind of pseudo-left politics. [What is needed now is to build the
movement into a great wave of **rejection against the reactionary
policies**]{.underline} of the ruling class, the right, and the Trump
administration and its allies. [Let us work on that basis and avoid
tactics that undermine it.]{.underline}

#### Even though issue specialization means that not every issue will be discussed directly every year, the skills and habits inculcated by our model are broadly transferable to issues of structural exclusion

Kevin J. **Elliott 19**, Assistant Professor of Political Science at
Murray State University, 11/14/19, "Democracy\'s Pin Factory: Issue
Specialization, the Division of Cognitive Labor, and Epistemic
Performance," American Journal of Political Science,
<https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12486>

Perhaps [the **biggest problem** with this]{.underline} hopeful [vision
of]{.underline} specialization\'s [epistemic power is that **[not every
issue will receive the attention of an issue
public]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Somin 2013, 106). [This is because issue
publics are an emergent phenomenon]{.underline} in the mass public
[and]{.underline} are thus [constituted through self‐selection. This
could bias their composition due to inequalities]{.underline} in civic
skills and motivation (Verba, Schlozman, and Brady 1995). Self‐selection
is exacerbated by the inclusion of associations and civil society groups
within the issue public matrix, since such groups have a well‐known
socioeconomic bias (Schattschneider 1960). Moreover, [[issue publics are
endogenous to issue salience]{.mark}, or the public attention paid to an
issue, since media coverage often plays a decisive role in directing
public attention to certain issues.]{.underline} Media coverage can also
be [biased toward conflictual stories and insubstantial soft
news]{.underline} (Shapiro 1998). This means not only that abstruse or
technical issues may receive less attention in favor of the trivial yet
telegenic, but also that those issues affecting marginalized groups
might attract smaller issue publics than their objective importance11
demands. These biases create a serious problem for an epistemic account
of issue specialization since it suggests there are pathologies of
attention that can prevent issue publics from bringing their powers to
bear on important issues.

[These [biases necessitate focused, institutional efforts to cultivate
an interest in politics among disadvantaged]{.mark} citizens so they can
help constitute new or less biased issue publics]{.underline}. For
instance, Lisa García Bedolla and Melissa Michelson (2012) argue that
campaigns' efforts to bolster turnout among marginalized groups cause
these groups to become durably politicized beyond a specific election,
suggesting lasting prodemocratic changes in their cognitive and
motivational orientation to politics. Such efforts should be
systematically encouraged.

A more ambitious approach can be found in the online deliberative forums
piloted by Neblo, Esterling, and Lazer (2018) involving elected
representatives and randomly invited constituents. [Three features of
these forums make them well suited to addressing bias in [issue
publics]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**First**, they **[reverse the usual
direction of participatory bias, disproportionately engaging poorer and
politically disconnected citizens]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Neblo,
Esterling, and Lazer 2018, 65). **[[Second]{.underline}]{.mark}**, by
[[focusing on single issues]{.mark}, they concentrate citizen attention
on issues that may not receive media coverage and [**offer** disengaged
citizens **a manageable**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[because issue
limited---**[entry point into politics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Lastly,
unlike most blue‐sky reforms cooked up by political scientists, these
forums incentivize their own adoption because representatives who
participate enjoy a several‐point electoral advantage from satisfied
constituents (Neblo, Esterling, and Lazer 2018, 109). Due to their
electoral incentives, representatives want to participate and so need
not be motivated by any special prodemocratic reform attitudes. Thus,
there are ways to build complementary institutions to stem the biases
inherent in issue publics.

[[Two considerations further lessen concerns about bias]{.mark}. First,
issue specialization highlights the importance of the less organized
part]{.underline} of issue publics---reversing the pluralist\'s error of
[emphasizing organized groups in the mistaken belief they are
approximately representative]{.underline}---by emphasizing electoral
incentives and information shortcuts, which operate in the mass public.
Second, [**[issue publics largely reflect inequalities in the political
system rather than originate them]{.underline}**. [To the extent biases
in issue salience]{.underline}]{.mark} [and attention [are corrected,
biases in issue publics will also subside]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is
important because it illustrates the neutrality of specialization;
whatever issues attract public attention gain epistemically via this
mechanism. In conditions of participatory inequality, this may lead to
important pathologies. Yet [[examples like the civil rights movement and
B]{.mark}lack [L]{.mark}ives [M]{.mark}atter [suggest]{.mark} that
[injustice can often attract as much attention as the]{.mark} latest
shiny bit of [political ephemera.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### ethos of humility (andreotti)

#### Debate's [not]{.underline} about finding the perfect solution, it's about [learning from the failures of our imperfect ones]{.underline}---the belief that any one debate can translate to material outcomes is [naïve at best]{.underline} and [complicit in the systems they critique at worst]{.underline}---topical advocacy encourages an ethos of [humility]{.underline} and [interconnectedness]{.underline} which can engender [ontological shifts]{.underline} in society and [confront the crises of modernity]{.underline}---but that requires a [willingness to be wrong]{.underline}

**Andreotti, 18**---Canada Research Chair in Race, Inequalities and
Global Change at University of British Columbia and Associate Professor
in the Faculty of Education (Vanessa de Oliviera, interviewed by Scott
Baker, "Countless Rebellions -- Decolonizing education,"
<https://mcconnellfoundation.ca/interview/vanessa-andreotti/>, dml)

Andreotti: When I talk about **[[humility]{.underline}]{.mark}**, it
[[is about]{.mark} **sitting at the edge**, [understanding the **limits
of knowing**]{.mark}, [not only of **our own knowledge**]{.mark}, [the
limits of **knowing itself**]{.mark}, the limits [of **making sense of
the world**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- understanding that it's possible to
reason with other senses. [Although we see ourselves as]{.underline}
individuated or as [**individuals**, we are **interwoven with everything
else**. [If we are going to **engage with the world in
change-making**]{.mark}, [it would be important to]{.mark} both
[**understand the contradictions** and **paradoxes**]{.mark} of our own
ways of knowing, but also to **sit at the edge of the way of being**
that engendered this way of knowing so that we can engage with the world
**[without trying to project]{.mark} our [delusions onto the world
itself]{.mark}**, without trying to **over-determine** both the
**direction** and **how the relationship should happen**]{.underline}.
So, starting from a place of not knowing and engaging with the world as
if we are not individuals, as we inhibit each other in multiple
temporalities, and taking responsibility for this form of engagement, I
think, for me, is what humility entails.

If we are able to be humble and accept that we exist as a part of a much
larger society and ecosystem, how do we then go about creating systems
change?

Andreotti: A system rises, peaks, and starts its decline. And,
generally, [[when a **system is in decline**,]{.mark} a lot of [people
want to **walk out**]{.mark} from that system]{.underline}. This is the
work of Debra Friesen. But one important thing to remember [when we are
walking out]{.underline} is that [**[we can't]{.mark} [create a
different system from the hot ashes of the system that hasn't yet cooled
down]{.mark}**[. In many alternative]{.mark} movements, [people **want
results straight away**]{.mark}. They want to **substitute the system**
that they had before for something that they **already know that they
can control**[. This is]{.mark}]{.underline} just again [[a
**replacement** of the securities]{.mark} that were [promised]{.mark} by
the system, the other system, [and now these]{.mark} promises [are
**perceived as broken**]{.mark}. But [what if]{.mark} [we understand the
promises of the systems as **unrealistic**]{.mark} **from the outset**
and start to look for other securities?]{.underline} In that sense,
[what we need is **not to replace it straight away**, because **we
can't**]{.underline}, basically. [We will end up **reproducing the old
system whether we like it or not**]{.underline}. But what if [[what we
need]{.mark} to do [is **experimentation**]{.mark}]{.underline}? [If we
want to experiment, [we need to **start from a place of not knowing**,
because **otherwise it's not an experiment**, it's you trying to
**engineer something**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [[if it is an
experiment]{.underline}]{.mark}, you are kind of doing it, [[you are
designing something that **you**]{.mark} [**know is going to fail**,
and]{.mark} the **[learning from this]{.mark} failure** is the **most
important thing**]{.underline}.

How do you go about making sure that you fail in the right way?

Andreotti: The same way that a new system cannot be built on the hot
ashes of the old, the role of improvisation here is that the
difficulties that we face --- [this sitting at the limits of what is
perceived as possible of what we know, the **[learning]{.mark} that [can
take place]{.mark}** in that space, [through
**failure**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[becomes a **fertilizer for
something**]{.mark} **else [that happens when these ashes cool]{.mark}
down**, the ashes of the old system]{.underline}.
[[What]{.underline}]{.mark} I think [[is important]{.underline}]{.mark}
here [[is **not to see failure as failure**]{.mark}. Failure is also
**success**. It's success in terms of the **learning that it generates**
--- for the **possibility that it opens**, in terms of the **new world
that it can create**]{.underline}. As a researcher, for example, in an
experiment, [[if I **keep doing the same experiment**, with the]{.mark}
[**same results**, it becomes]{.mark} not only [a **waste of
energy**,]{.mark} but, because [I'm **not**]{.mark} **deriving any
[learning]{.mark} out of it**, also **boring**!]{.underline} There is a
sense of it in this experimentation and improvisation, [that [in order
for it to be]{.underline}]{.mark} [**fulfilling**, and [**rewarding**,
and]{.mark} **exciting**, [and **fun** even]{.mark}, [it needs to be
**learning**]{.mark}. And it needs to be **learning [from
failure]{.mark}**. [And it needs to **make**]{.mark}
**[mistakes]{.mark}** too!]{.underline} [It's **part of the
process**.]{.underline}

### confirmation bias (manin)

#### Debate is [distinct]{.underline} from discussion due to its [adversarial nature]{.underline}---we control uniqueness and the internal link is linear, multiple factors predispose us to avoiding clash, so you should seek to guarantee it as much as possible---the mere presence of limits or concessionary ground lapse into [confirmation bias]{.underline} at best and [mutual ignorance]{.underline} at worst. Centering debate on the [instrumental consequences]{.underline} of the 1AC's proposal solves.

**Manin, 17**---Professor of Politics, NYU (Bernard, "Political
Deliberation & the Adversarial Principle," Daedalus, Volume 146, Issue
3, Summer 2017, p.39-50, dml)

[The idea of organizing [collective deliberation as an **adversarial
debate**,]{.mark} a debate **for** and **against** a position, is not
new]{.underline}. It has its origins, or at least one of its early
illustrations, in classical antiquity. Recent conceptions of
deliberative democracy and the practices they have inspired (such as
Deliberative Polls, citizens\' juries, and consensus conferences) have
led us to forget an older idea of political deliberation, formulated by
Greek and Roman historians and theorists of rhetoric, from Herodotus to
Quintilian via Thucydides, Aristotle, and Cicero. [Today\'s
conceptions]{.underline} of deliberative democracy [[put the emphasis on
**discussion**]{.mark}, making it essential that the members of the
deliberating group **discuss among themselves**, **engage in dialogue**,
and **exchange arguments** with one another. The **[opposition of points
of view]{.mark}**]{.underline}, if mentioned, [[occupies a **secondary
place**]{.mark}. It is viewed]{.underline} either as a precondition to
deliberation proper or **[simply as a natural consequence]{.underline}**
of pluralistic societies in which the expression of opinions is free.
[Yet in the ancient idea]{.underline} of deliberation, [the opposition
of points of view occupied a **central** place]{.underline}. To
simplify, in the ancient conception, [orators advocating opposed
policies each presented arguments in favor of their position and against
their opponent\'s]{.underline}. These arguments were presented before an
assembly that subsequently decided on the policy. It seems reasonable to
assume that members of the assembly also discussed the arguments among
themselves. But [the **opposition of points of view** -- **not mutual
discussion** -- constituted the **motor** and **chief element** of
deliberation]{.underline}.

It is in this way, for example, that Thucydides presents the major
scenes of deliberation in The Peloponnesian War: the debate at Sparta
about the decision to enter the war, the Athenian debate over the
punishment to inflict on the inhabitants of Mytilene between Cleon and
Diodotus, and the debate in the Athenian assembly over the Sicilian
expedition where Nicias and Alcibiades confronted one another.1 In these
scenes, the orators who advance opposing points of view do not discuss
among themselves and do not seek to persuade their opposition. Rather,
they seek to convince the assembly to whom they address their speeches.
Thucydides presents these scenes as deliberations of the assembly. At
various points in his account of the debate over Mytilene, he refers to
it as "deliberation."2 In such deliberation, the driving element is the
hearing of opposed persuasive speeches. Similarly, on several occasions
in Politics, Aristotle indicates that the task of the assembly is to
deliberate on common affairs.3 In Rhetoric, we find a more precise
description of the assembly\'s deliberative activity: orators arguing
for and against the decisions being contemplated.4 Here, as well, the
orators speak, offering opposed opinions and arguments, but the citizens
deliberate. In a scene of deliberation among the Persians recounted in
The Histories, Herodotus reflects on the benefits expected from the
method of opposed speeches. "If opinions contrary to one another have
not been expressed," he has Artabanus explain, "it is not possible to
choose the one which it is best to adopt."5 Note that this argument is
purely epistemic: to hear contrary opinions is necessary for discovering
the right answer. No consideration of fairness enters. The importance of
the adversarial principle in the ancients appears not only in
theoretical writings; we also find its reflection in institutional
practices. To wit, after the oligarchical revolutions and the
restoration of democracy at the start of the fourth century bce, the
Athenians adopted two institutions that mandated a for-and-against
debate: the graphè paranomon and the nomothetai.6 The graphè paranomon
authorized a decision already voted on by the assembly to be brought
before the courts (in which the judges were ordinary citizens selected
by lot) on the grounds that the decision was contrary to the law or
simply harmful to the Athenian people. The plaintiff and the citizen who
had proposed the contested decree would then plead their cases before
the courts. The decree was annulled if the verdict went in favor of the
accusation. Any of the assembly\'s decisions could thereby be submitted
to a sort of second reading before the courts. However, this second
reading, which possessed greater authority than the first, needed to
include an adversarial debate, while the first examination by the
assembly might have proceeded without oppositions. The institution of
the nomothetai illustrates even more clearly the benefits expected from
the use of the adversarial method in the political realm. Here, the
action did not unfold before the courts, and there was neither plaintiff
nor defendant. The adversarial form, nevertheless, was maintained.
Whenever it seemed desirable to abrogate and replace certain laws,
proposals for new laws were put forth and announced in public venues in
advance. These proposals were then defended before the nomothetai by
their initiators. At the same time, five citizens were elected for the
purpose of defending the existing laws whose abrogation had been
proposed. The institutions of the nomothetai and the graphè paranomon
were adopted as means for protecting the newly restored democracy from
the impassioned and hasty decisions from which the city had suffered,
especially during the Peloponnesian War. To protect against this
outcome, Athenian democrats turned to institutions that conferred the
most authoritative decisions on groups of citizens who would necessarily
have heard the arguments for and against the measures under
consideration. Just because the ancients conceived of political
deliberation as a confrontation between opposing views is not, in
itself, a reason for adopting their models. All that history can do is
open us to perspectives we perhaps would not have otherwise thought of.
We must now ask ourselves why it might be desirable to organize
political deliberation according to the principle of hearing both sides.
I see four principal reasons for doing so: 1) Improving the quality of
collective decisions 2) Counteracting the fragmentation of the public
sphere 3) Facilitating the comprehension of choices 4) Treating the
minority with respect.

Let us begin with improving the quality of collective decisions. A long
tradition of thought, including, in particular, the reflections of John
Stuart Mill and Karl Popper, has highlighted what we can call the
epistemic virtues of criticism. Several arguments have shown that [[to
submit an idea to criticism constitutes]{.mark} one of [the **best means
of testing**]{.mark} **its [validity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This holds
for practical ideas. [[A decision is **more likely** to be]{.mark} of a
**[high quality]{.mark}** -- whether in **factual** and **technical
terms**, or in terms of **values** -- [if the proposals for action have
been **submitted to criticism** ]{.mark}**beforehand**. Criticism
[permits]{.mark} the **elimination**, or at least the **reduction**, of
proposals involving **false factual beliefs**, **logical errors**, or
**objectionable moral choices**]{.underline}. We do not need to repeat
here the arguments establishing the epistemic merits of criticism. No
one today would deny that criticism is one of the best means at our
disposal to test the quality, technical and moral, of practical
proposals.

Nevertheless, [the conclusion that we **generally draw** from these
arguments is that it is enough **simply to establish the freedom to
express criticism** to produce its benefits]{.underline}. This is
without doubt how Mill reasoned. We find an even more striking
expression of this position in the famous free-speech dissent of Supreme
Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. Men, he wrote, will eventually
realize "that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade
in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to
get itself accepted in the competition of the market."7 [Yet the
conclusion that the free exchange of ideas is a sufficient guarantee is
**not justified**. Freedom of speech on its own **does not ensure** that
the **right to criticize** will be exercised]{.underline}. Furthermore,
as we shall see, [[the fact]{.mark} that [criticisms are put forward
**does not guarantee**]{.mark} that [they will **receive proper
consideration**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Several mechanisms can prevent the ability to criticize freely from
leading to its exercise. I group these together here under the label of
conformism. Social psychology has long told us (with elaboration in
Rousseau) that people want to be liked. Being esteemed and approved of
by others also provides a gratifying image of one\'s self. It follows
that when people perceive that, in a given social environment, others\'
opinions lean in a certain direction, they tend to bend their own
expressions in the same direction to gain the approval of their peers.
They avoid expressing dissenting or critical views, reinforcing the
mechanism of the "spiral of silence."8 Even in the context of
discussion, we observe the disposition to conform to what is perceived
as the norm within the group. This phenomenon is at the heart of what
has been named, since the works of psychologist Serge Moscovici, the
polarizing effect of group discussions.9 Thus, even if criticism is
formally free, a powerful social force works to marginalize, or even to
stifle, its expression.

Contrary to what liberal theorists often affirm, social or cultural
[diversity within a group **does not suffice** to assure a confrontation
of opinions **critically opposed to one another**. Suppose, for example,
a deliberating body whose members, **while being diverse** with regard
to social position, education, and beliefs, also **share a fear** of
some danger]{.underline}. Let us imagine, furthermore, that this
assembly discusses a measure that would contribute to the reduction of
this danger; for example, strengthening the powers of the police. [In
this context, it is **unlikely** that collective deliberation will
**bring forth many arguments against the adoption** of this measure,
**however much social** or **cultural diversity** there may be in the
group]{.underline}. Rather, the discussion will produce an accumulation
of reasons in favor of increased police power, with various members
finding, from within their own particular perspectives, diverse reasons
for adopting this course of action that others, differently situated,
may not have seen on their own. Yet even if increasing the prerogatives
of the police did, in fact, contribute to the realization of the desired
end, [the measure might also **present undesirable effects** or
**features** in other ways. Collective deliberation should **precisely
bring to light these potential negative effects** and **weigh them in
the balance against the benefits** of the measure]{.underline}. But in
our case, the assembly will systematically underestimate these possible
negative features even though members of the assembly have the liberty
to oppose the measure and criticize one another.

It appears, then, that [if one wants [to obtain]{.mark} from political
deliberation the **[favorable epistemic effects]{.mark} of criticism**,
the expression of [opposing opinions **must be encouraged**, **not
merely permitted**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

But there is another reason to ensure that the participants in a
deliberation are actually confronted with opposing points of view; it
concerns the reception of arguments, rather than their production.
Studies in social and cognitive psychology show that, confronted with
new information or evidence, people have a systematic propensity to see
in it a confirmation of their previous beliefs. In a now-classic
experiment, psychologists presented the same ensemble of documents and
studies concerning the death penalty and its effects to two groups of
subjects selected on the basis of their antecedent opinions: one group
composed of subjects favorable to the death penalty, the other subjects
who are rather hostile to it. After being confronted with these
documents, the group that was favorable to the death penalty became more
favorable to it, and the group hostile to it became still more
hostile.10 This phenomenon is particularly marked when the documents
presented to the subjects were ambiguous and called for interpretation.
The propensity to find support for one\'s antecedent beliefs is known as
"confirmation bias."11 Research has also shown that group discussion
reinforces the effects of confirmation bias. Groups interpret
information with more bias than do individuals; and they privilege
information that supports their antecedent beliefs to an even greater
degree than do individuals.12 Two mechanisms explain this tendency.
First, as noted earlier, group settings accentuate tendencies that
predominate among individuals. If privileging information supportive of
prior beliefs is already the dominant tendency among individuals, it is
not surprising that this tendency should be amplified in group
discussion. But a second, and more surprising, mechanism is also at
work. It seems that groups tend to discuss principally the information
that was already known to all the members before the beginning of the
discussion. Within groups, it turns out, discussion turns essentially on
shared knowledge. Members of the group are reluctant to discuss those
bits of information that are known only to one or a few other members
prior to the discussion.13 Shared information appears to have more
weight in the eyes of the group members, and has a greater chance of
being mentioned during the discussion, and thus remembered later.14
Finally, information supporting the position preferred by the greatest
number of group members has a greater likelihood of becoming the object
of discussion than information supporting the contrary position.15
Collective discussion thus tends to produce a disproportionate volume of
information and arguments in favor of the already-dominant belief in the
group.

[If one wishes [to check]{.mark} the effects of **[confirmation
bias]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}-- a phenomenon to which groups are
particularly vulnerable -- [one must take **proactive measures**. One
can]{.underline}, for example, [**call special attention to arguments
contrary to prior beliefs** by]{.underline} highlighting them
(literally) or by [making them **cognitively more salient**. Not only is
the free expression of a multiplicity of voices **not sufficient** to
assure the **confrontation of opposing views**, but the **mere
[expression]{.mark} of contrary arguments** [is **not
sufficient**]{.mark} for others [to **understand**]{.mark} **those
[arguments]{.mark}** [or **consider them
objectively**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[In the absence of measures that **actively induce individuals** to pay
particular attention to **evidence** and **points of view opposed to
their own**, collective deliberation will have the **greatest
likelihood** of simply **reinforcing antecedent opinions**. In a
political deliberation]{.underline}, in short, [[we **cannot
expect**]{.mark} that the [gathering of diverse points of view will
**spontaneously produce** ]{.mark}**a [clash]{.mark} of arguments pro**
and **contra**, nor that it will **bring about a balanced consideration
of views**]{.underline}. Mill was [wrong to assume that, in a society or
an assembly composed of diverse members, opposing opinions would
**already be there**, **waiting to be set against one another** once
they were **allowed to be uttered**]{.underline}. Mill wrote: "The most
intolerant of churches, the Roman Catholic Church, even at the
canonization of a saint, admits, and listens patiently to, a 'devil\'s
advocate.\'"16 He failed to see that [the **presence of a devil\'s
advocate was required**, not merely **admitted**]{.underline}. And
through [the requirement]{.underline}, the Church [**secured** that
objections]{.underline} to the canonization of a given person [were
**aired** and **considered**, even if no individual would otherwise have
spontaneously offered them]{.underline}.17

[The confrontation of opposing opinions also has merit beyond eliciting
unshared perspectives. It **unifies the field** in which opinions are
formed and expressed, **counteracting the fragmentation** of the public
sphere. [In order to be **opposed to an opinion** and]{.mark} to
[**contest it**, it is **necessary** that one]{.mark} be **cognizant**
of that opinion and **[take it into consideration]{.mark}**. In a
society in which points of view are objectively diverse, the [**open**
and **explicit clash**]{.mark} of opposing ideas [is neither the
**natural state** nor the **sole possible condition**.]{.mark} Another
configuration is **just as likely**: **mutual ignorance**]{.underline}.
The German sociologist Georg Simmel therefore argued that conflict
between social groups paradoxically served the cause of social
integration: first, by placing the conflicting groups into a
relationship with one another and, second, by exerting a pressure for
unity among the secondary divisions within each group. We can advance a
similar argument in matters of opinion. [The clash of opinions **unifies
the field** in which beliefs confront one another, **creating a space**
in which those beliefs are **addressed to** and **respond to one
another**. [This task of mutual addressing is **harder**]{.mark} [when
the space of opinions is **fragmented**]{.mark}]{.underline} into a
multitude of islets, homogenous within themselves but formed [in
conditions of **little communication** with outsiders]{.underline}.

[Several factors]{.underline} -- some older, some of more recent origin
-- [now **trend in the direction** of this sort of
fragmentation]{.underline}. First, we have long known that
[[people]{.mark} are **selective** in their choice of contacts and
social relations. They [**tend disproportionately** to be in contact
with people who **share their political
opinions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.18 Psychologically, [many **fear the
face-to-face expression** of political disagreement and **want to avoid
it as much as possible**]{.underline}.

[More recent factors also work in the direction of fragmentation: the
development of **cable television**]{.underline} and its thematic
stations, [the spread of the **Internet**, and]{.underline} finally the
movement toward [**residential** and **territorial
segregation**]{.underline}. Although the effects of these
transformations are still difficult to estimate, they all present an
analogous structure: [people are now offered, in multiple ways, greater
opportunities for communicating and coming into contact **only with
other individuals like themselves**]{.underline}.

Cable television and the rise of opinion-based television stations (a
phenomenon currently more pronounced in the United States than in
Europe) provide viewers with the possibility of receiving a high
proportion of their information only from a channel to which they feel
ideologically close. Worse still, cable TV allows individuals with
little interest in politics to avoid political news altogether and watch
only entertainment programs.19 For its part, the Internet has
dramatically increased the number and types of people with whom one can
enter into contact. But studies on the usage of the Web suggest that
contacts and links are established primarily through personal
affinities, and in particular through ideological affinities within the
political domain. Progressive blogs and forums link to other progressive
sites but not to conservative sites, and vice versa. From these islets
and networks of like-minded individuals we can expect the increased
effects of reinforcement and polarization, because, in general,
interacting with people of similar beliefs pushes one more toward the
extreme positions of the views common to the group.20 Finally, the
movement toward residential segregation, which has already progressed in
the United States and is at work today in Europe, further contributes to
the fragmentation of the public space of communication. If it is true
that opinions are strongly correlated with sociocultural and ethnic
factors, then in a neighborhood whose inhabitants share the same
sociocultural or ethnic profile, each person is likely, for the most
part, to encounter neighbors who share the same opinions. A selective
exposure to similar opinions emerges de facto.

Faced with these forces of fragmentation, [**only intentional collective
action** can be expected to **produce a degree of unification** of the
public political sphere. This second justification for the deliberate
encouragement of adversarial political debates is particularly salient
today]{.underline}.

True, [[adversarial debate is **by nature reductive**.]{.mark} Faced
with some political problem, the polity usually has a **multitude of
possible courses** of action, not all of which will be **mutually
exclusive**. Yet the reductive character of the adversarial method is
also **one of its merits**. It **simplifies complexity**, making the
choices **easier to grasp**]{.underline}. There is no doubt, for
example, that the current economic situation in Europe and the United
States calls for a range of measures that are more or less intermingled
and complementary to one another. [To obtain a **synoptic view**
of]{.underline} these [measures]{.underline} and their relations [and to
**choose among them** would require **considerable cognitive
effort**]{.underline}. There are cognitive advantages to presenting the
policy response as a choice between reducing public deficits now and
maintaining or increasing these deficits in the short term to prevent
further decline until the economy has regained its normal growth rate.
As democrats, [[we **cannot discount the value** of such cognitive
simplicity]{.mark}. Groups of experts may be able to deliberate without
using the adversarial method. But if we want ordinary (or even
well-informed) citizens to **participate ably** in collective
deliberation, the simplification achieved by the adversary system is an
**almost indispensable instrument**.]{.underline}

The fourth principle in support of the adversarial method is the value
of treating the minority with respect. [[No matter how]{.mark}
conscientiously citizens deliberate, it is likely that **[disagreement
will remain]{.mark}** at the end of the process]{.underline}. Decisions
will therefore be taken by the majority. [The majority of people will
get to live with the decision they desired; a minority of [people will
have to **live under a decision they did not
support**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To be sure, the decision itself formed
the minority: it did not exist per se before the vote. But the manner of
conducting the deliberation before the vote entails consequences for the
treatment of those who, after the vote, will make up the minority.

[If the deliberation has been conducted as a **debate between opposed
positions**, with each camp presenting its reasons in favor of its
position and criticizing those advanced by the opposition, two
consequences follow]{.underline}. After a vote has been taken, the
minority must obey the decision, but at least [the reasons aiming to
justify this decision will have been **formulated** and **made public**.
The minority might still refuse to listen to these reasons seriously and
in good faith, but it was **given the chance to consider them**. The
minority members were therefore treated with the **respect owed to
autonomous beings**]{.underline}. Once children have reached the age of
autonomy, parents must justify the orders they give them. When they are
not yet autonomous, children must obey orders simply because they are
orders. So, too, [if the minority members **have not had the possibility
of hearing the reasons** for the decision they must obey against their
wishes, they are placed in a situation of having to obey the order
**simply because it is an order**, or simply because it obtained the
most votes. I do not mean to imply that the members of the minority will
consequently be more disposed to obey the decision]{.underline}.
Sometimes justifications exacerbate the opposition. [But justifying
orders **shows greater respect** for the autonomy of those receiving
them]{.underline}.

On the flip side, [the reasons for not taking the decision that
ultimately triumphed would also have been put forward. These criticisms
and objections **did not prevail**, but they were at least
**articulated** and **made public**. From the majority\'s perspective,
because it won, it will naturally think that it was right; but in the
process, it **had to listen to the opposition** explaining their
justification]{.underline}. [The [members of the majority were **at
minimum forced to see that there were reasons supporting the other
side**]{.mark}. It seems reasonable to think that, as a result, the
majority will be **less inclined** to consider the minority as
**unintelligent** or **ill-intentioned**]{.underline}.

Before I proceed to the practical consequences that we can draw from my
argument, I must first respond to an objection: that rendering
obligatory the presentation of opposing points of view in the public
sphere would require constraints on public discourse and encroachments
on freedom of speech. In response to this objection I would first
suggest turning to an institution that in the relatively recent past
followed just this path: the fairness doctrine in effect in the United
States from 1927 to 1987. The fairness doctrine, implemented by the
Federal Communications Commission, made it obligatory for radio and
television stations to give an evenly balanced presentation of "opposing
viewpoints on controversial issues of public importance." The fairness
doctrine not only imposed equality in airtime; it also required the
presentation of viewpoints opposed to one another. The doctrine did not
apply to airtime during electoral campaigns, which was regulated on
other terms. It applied instead to any question that became the object
of public controversy outside of electoral periods. The
constitutionality of this doctrine was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court
in the famous 1969 decision of Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC.21 The
central argument that the Court invoked in support of the
constitutionality of the fairness doctrine was that, in regard to
liberty of expression on the airwaves, it is "the right of the viewing
and listening public, and not the right of the broadcasters, which is
paramount." The Court thus held that listeners and viewers had the right
to hear conflicting viewpoints in order to make up their mind on the
issues: "Speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression;
it is the essence of self-government."22 The fairness doctrine was
abandoned for two reasons. First, the doctrine led radio and television
stations to avoid controversial subjects for the sake of not exposing
themselves to lawsuits claiming they had violated the law. Second, the
question of what exactly constituted the opposition of one point of view
against another became the subject of repeated litigation, and the fcc
proved unable to reduce the insecurity and juridical uncertainty that
arose on this front. Despite its eventual abandonment, however, the Red
Lion decision shows that the obligation for the media to present
conflicting viewpoints is compatible with a certain interpretation of
freedom of speech in the public sphere, an interpretation that focuses
on the rights of the receiving public. That the U.S. Supreme Court has
since rejected this interpretation does not mean that the arguments
advanced in Red Lion were objectively weak. They are, in any case,
consistent with the claims of this essay. What, then, should we do in
practice to foster the confrontation of opposing arguments in today\'s
democracies? Without claiming to provide a complete and detailed
response to this question, I will conclude by suggesting two concrete
means for promoting the adversarial principle in politics. The first is
a practice yet to be invented, which would be implemented outside of
electoral periods. The second consists of reinforcing a practice already
used in electoral campaigns. First, my suggestion for the future.
Outside of electoral periods, civil-society actors (such as foundations
or think tanks) could organize adversarial debates on subjects of public
interest. These debates would not be regularly scheduled, but would be
organized only when a question sparked significant interest from the
public (as with such topics as nuclear energy, assisted suicide, or, in
certain countries, the wearing of the hijab) or when a large number of
citizens mobilized in favor of a cause. More generally, these public
debates would not aim to replace any existing democratic practices (such
as electoral campaigns or parliamentary debates), but would complement
them.

[Neither the exposition of conflicting viewpoints nor communication
across ideological divides can be made mandatory. This **does not mean**
that it is **useless to try to facilitate them**]{.underline}. Indeed,
[[**the probability of being confronted with opposing points of view
matters**: it]{.mark} tends to [make one\'s thoughts]{.mark} **more
anticipatory**, **[careful]{.mark}**, and **subtle**]{.underline}.23 [In
contemporary circumstances, this probability **tends to diminish**. The
**active promotion** of adversarial debates aims to **counteract this
pernicious tendency**]{.underline}.

Given that the goal of these debates would be to further the formulation
and diffusion of arguments for and against a given public decision, they
should be guided by the following principle: [speakers should defend or
criticize a given policy or position **only with reference to its own
merits**, and not in response to reasons **external to the policy** or
**position**. The arguments advanced in these debates should concern the
**advantages** or **disadvantages**]{.underline} -- whether technical or
moral -- **[inherent in the decision]{.underline}**. I call this the
principle of relevant reasons. This principle has two implications: the
first concerns simplifying the debate to one issue; the second concerns
choosing the right participants.

[In order to encourage citizens to **take account of** and **weigh the
reasons for** and **against a given decision**, each question that can
be **defined objectively** and **independent** from other questions
should be **debated separately**. [Multidimensionality]{.mark} and the
bundling of different questions [**undermine the coherence** of the
arguments]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

To be sure, at election time, the voter will vote for a candidate or
party that has bundled questions without an objective connection between
them. Such grouping may be desirable, because it permits negotiations
between different strands of the party. Nevertheless, [to understand the
bundling and negotiation **well enough to cast an informed vote**, the
voter needs to have thought through the different issues **separately**,
aided by adversarial debate]{.underline}.

[It is]{.underline} probably [too difficult to completely exclude
nonrelevant reasons]{.underline} -- that is, [reasons **not
substantively linked to the policy in question**]{.underline} -- [at the
moment of organizing [a deliberative debate.]{.mark} But the principle
**remains valid**: nonrelevant arguments should be **sidelined as much
as possible**. As a consequence, each debate [should **focus on a
specific theme**,]{.mark} rather than on **platforms comprising multiple
dimensions**]{.underline}.

The other implication of the principle of relevant reasons concerns the
choice of participants. [Speakers should be permitted to defend policies
that promote their own interests, but **only** on the condition that
their interests be both **publicly declared** and **linked to the
substance of the policy they recommend** -- not to **external
interests**]{.underline} like advancing their careers [or]{.underline}
promoting [objectives that have **no connection with the policy under
debate**]{.underline}. Speakers should thus mainly be experts,
representatives of associations, activists, and persons enjoying a
recognized moral authority. Politicians might participate so long as
that participation satisfies the principle of relevant reasons: namely,
that they address themselves solely to the question under debate, to the
exclusion of other themes in the platform of their party. Their
professional and career prospects should play no role in these debates.

I've come to appreciate what a crucial tool it is for learning,
[especially [in an **increasingly interconnected**]{.mark} and
**[complicated world]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [As]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[tech]{.mark}nology** [makes it **easier to lie** and **spread false
info**]{.mark}rmation incredibly **quickly**]{.underline}, [[we need
**intellectually humble**]{.mark}, **[curious
people]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

I've also realized how difficult it is to foster intellectual humility.
In my reporting on this, I've learned there are three main challenges on
the path to humility:

1\. In order for us to acquire more intellectual humility,
[[we]{.underline}]{.mark} all, even the smartest among us, [[need to
**better appreciate** our **cognitive blind spots**]{.mark}. Our minds
are more imperfect and imprecise than we'd often like to
admit]{.underline}. Our ignorance can be invisible.

2\. Even when we overcome that immense challenge and figure out our
errors, we need to remember we won't necessarily be punished for saying,
"I was wrong." And we need to be braver about saying it. We need a
culture that celebrates those words.

3\. We'll never achieve perfect intellectual humility. So we need to
choose our convictions thoughtfully.

This is all to say: Intellectual humility isn't easy. But damn, it's a
virtue worth striving for, and failing for, in this new year.

Intellectual humility, explained

Intellectual humility is simply "the recognition that the things you
believe in might in fact be wrong," as Mark Leary, a social and
personality psychologist at Duke University, tells me.

But don't confuse it with overall humility or bashfulness. It's not
about being a pushover; it's not about lacking confidence, or
self-esteem. The intellectually humble don't cave every time their
thoughts are challenged.

Instead, [[it's a **method of thinking**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It's
about **[entertaining the possibility]{.mark}** that **[you may be
wrong]{.mark}** and being open to learning from the experience of
others]{.underline}. [Intellectual humility is about being **actively
curious**]{.underline} about your blind spots. [One **illustration** is
in the **ideal** of the **scientific method**, where a scientist
**actively works against her own hypothesis**]{.underline}, [attempting
to **rule out any other** alternative **explanations**]{.underline} for
a phenomenon [**before settling** on a **conclusion**]{.underline}. It's
about asking: What am I missing here?

It doesn't require a high IQ or a particular skill set. [It
does]{.underline}, however, [require **making a habit** of **thinking
about your limits**]{.underline}, which can be painful. "It's a process
of monitoring your own confidence," Leary says.

This idea is older than social psychology. Philosophers from the
earliest days have grappled with the limits of human knowledge. Michel
de Montaigne, the 16th-century French philosopher credited with
inventing the essay, wrote that "the plague of man is boasting of his
knowledge."

Social psychologists have learned that humility is associated with other
valuable character traits: People who score higher on intellectual
humility questionnaires are more open to hearing opposing views. They
more readily seek out information that conflicts with their worldview.
They pay more attention to evidence and have a stronger self-awareness
when they answer a question incorrectly.

When you ask the intellectually arrogant if they've heard of bogus
historical events like "Hamrick's Rebellion," they'll say, "Sure." The
intellectually humble are less likely to do so. Studies have found that
cognitive reflection --- i.e., analytic thinking --- is correlated with
being better able to discern fake news stories from real ones. These
studies haven't looked at intellectual humility per se, but it's
plausible there's an overlap.

Most important of all, the intellectually humble are more likely to
admit it when they are wrong. When we admit we're wrong, we can grow
closer to the truth.

One reason I've been thinking about the virtue of humility recently is
because our president, Donald Trump, is one of the least humble people
on the planet.

It was Trump who said on the night of his nomination, "I alone can fix
it," with the "it" being our entire political system. It was Trump who
once said, "I have one of the great memories of all time." More
recently, Trump told the Associated Press, "I have a natural instinct
for science," in dodging a question on climate change.

A frustration I feel about **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the era
of history he represents is that his pride and his success --- he is
among the most powerful people on earth --- seem to be related. He
[[exemplifies how]{.mark} our [**society rewards confidence** and
**bluster**, **not truthfulness**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Yet we've also seen some very high-profile examples lately of how
overconfident leadership can be ruinous for companies. Look at what
happened to Theranos, a company that promised to change the way blood
samples are drawn. It was all hype, all bluster, and it collapsed. Or
consider Enron's overconfident executives, who were often hailed for
their intellectual brilliance --- they ran the company into the ground
with risky, suspect financial decisions.

The problem with arrogance is that the truth always catches up. Trump
may be president and confident in his denials of climate change, but the
changes to our environment will still ruin so many things in the future.

Why it's so hard to see our blind spots: "Our ignorance is invisible to
us"

As I've been reading the psychological research on intellectual humility
and the character traits it correlates with, I can't help but fume: Why
can't more people be like this?

We need more intellectual humility for two reasons. One is that our
culture promotes and rewards overconfidence and arrogance (think Trump
and Theranos, or the advice your career counselor gave you when going
into job interviews). At the same time, when we are wrong --- out of
ignorance or error --- and realize it, our culture doesn't make it easy
to admit it. Humbling moments too easily can turn into moments of
humiliation.

So how can we promote intellectual humility for both of these
conditions?

In asking that question of researchers and scholars, I've learned to
appreciate how hard a challenge it is to foster intellectual humility.

First off, I think it's helpful to remember how flawed the human brain
can be and how prone we all are to intellectual blind spots. [**[When
you learn]{.mark}** about **[how]{.mark} [the brain]{.mark}** actually
**[works]{.mark}**, **how it** actually **perceives the world**, **[it's
hard not to be]{.mark}** a bit **[horrified]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and
a bit humbled.

[We]{.underline} often **[can't see]{.underline}** --- [**or** even
**sense**]{.underline} --- **[what we don't know]{.underline}**. It
helps to realize that [it's **normal**]{.underline} and human [to be
**wrong**]{.underline}.

It's rare that a viral meme also provides a surprisingly deep lesson on
the imperfect nature of the human mind. But believe it or not, the great
"Yanny or Laurel" debate of 2018 fits the bill.

For the very few of you who didn't catch it --- I hope you're recovering
nicely from that coma --- here's what happened.

An audio clip (you can hear it below) says the name "Laurel" in a
robotic voice. Or does it? Some people hear the clip and immediately
hear "Yanny." And both sets of people --- Team Yanny and Team Laurel ---
are indeed hearing the same thing.

Hearing, the perception of sound, ought to be a simple thing for our
brains to do. That so many people can listen to the same clip and hear
such different things should give us humbling pause. Hearing "Yanny" or
"Laurel" in any given moment ultimately depends on a whole host of
factors: the quality of the speakers you're using, whether you have
hearing loss, your expectations.

Here's the deep lesson to draw from all of this: Much as we might tell
ourselves our experience of the world is the truth, our reality will
always be an interpretation. Light enters our eyes, sound waves enter
our ears, chemicals waft into our noses, and it's up to our brains to
make a guess about what it all is.

Perceptual tricks like this ("the dress" is another one) reveal that our
perceptions are not the absolute truth, that the physical phenomena of
the universe are indifferent to whether our feeble sensory organs can
perceive them correctly. We're just guessing. Yet these phenomena leave
us indignant: How could it be that our perception of the world isn't the
only one?

That sense of indignation is called naive realism: the feeling that our
perception of the world is the truth. "I think we sometimes confuse
effortlessness with accuracy," Chris Chabris, a psychological researcher
who co-authored a book on the challenges of human perception, tells me.
When something is so immediate and effortless to us --- hearing the
sound of "Yanny" --- it just feels true. (Similarly, psychologists find
when a lie is repeated, it's more likely to be misremembered as being
true, and for a similar reason: When you're hearing something for the
second or third time, your brain becomes faster to respond to it. And
that fluency is confused with truth.)

[[Our **interpretations of reality** are often
**arbitrary**]{.underline}, [but we're]{.underline}]{.mark} still
**[[stubborn]{.mark} about them]{.underline}**. Nonetheless, [[the
**same observations**]{.mark} can [lead to **wildly different
conclusions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

(Here's that same sentence in GIF form.)

For every sense and every component of human judgment, there are
illusions and ambiguities we interpret arbitrarily.

[Some are **gravely serious**]{.underline}. **[[White
people]{.underline}]{.mark}** often [[perceive black men to be]{.mark}
bigger, taller, and more muscular (and]{.underline} therefore **[[more
threatening]{.underline}]{.mark}**) than they really are. [[That's
**racial bias**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- but it's also a socially
constructed illusion. [When we're taught or learn to fear other people,
our **brains distort** their **potential threat**]{.underline}. They
seem more menacing, and we want to build walls around them. When we
learn or are taught that other people are less than human, we're less
likely to look upon them kindly and more likely to be okay when violence
is committed against them.

Not only are our interpretations of the world often arbitrary, but we're
often overconfident in them. "Our ignorance is invisible to us," David
Dunning, an expert on human blind spots, says.

You might recognize his name as half of the psychological phenomenon
that bears his name: [[the Dunning-Kruger effect]{.underline}]{.mark}.
That's [[where people]{.mark} of low ability]{.underline} --- let's say,
those who fail to understand logic puzzles --- [tend to unduly
[overestimate their abilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Inexperience
masquerades as expertise]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

An irony of the Dunning-Kruger effect is that so many people
misinterpret it, are overconfident in their understanding of it, and get
it wrong.

When people talk or write about the Dunning-Kruger effect, it's almost
always in reference to other people. "The fact is this is a phenomenon
that visits all of us sooner or later," Dunning says. We're all
overconfident in our ignorance from time to time. (Perhaps related: Some
65 percent of Americans believe they're more intelligent than average,
which is wishful thinking.)

Similarly, we're overconfident in our ability to remember. Human memory
is extremely malleable, prone to small changes. When we remember, we
don't wind back our minds to a certain time and relive that exact
moment, yet many of us think our memories work like a videotape.

Dunning hopes his work helps people understand that "not knowing the
scope of your own ignorance is part of the human condition," he says.
"But [the problem with it is **we see it in other people**, and **we
don't see it in ourselves**]{.underline}. [The **first rule** of the
**Dunning-Kruger club** is **you don't know you're a member** of the
Dunning-Kruger club]{.underline}."

People are unlikely to judge you harshly for admitting you're wrong

In 2012, psychologist Will Gervais scored an honor any PhD science
student would covet: a co-authored paper in the journal Science, one of
the top interdisciplinary scientific journals in the world. Publishing
in Science doesn't just help a researcher rise up in academic circles;
it often gets them a lot of media attention too.

One of the experiments in the paper tried to see if getting people to
think more rationally would make them less willing to report religious
beliefs. They had people look at a picture of Rodin's The Thinker or
another statue. They thought The Thinker would nudge people to think
harder, more analytically. In this more rational frame of mind, then,
the participants would be less likely to endorse believing in something
as faith-based and invisible as religion, and that's what the study
found. It was catnip for science journalists: one small trick to change
the way we think.

But it was a tiny, small-sample study, the exact type that is prone to
yielding false positives. Several years later, another lab attempted to
replicate the findings with a much larger sample size, and failed to
find any evidence for the effect.

And while Gervais knew that the original study wasn't rigorous, he
couldn't help but feel a twinge of discomfort.

"Intellectually, I could say the original data weren't strong," he says.
"That's very different from the human, personal reaction to it. Which is
like, 'Oh, shit, there's going to be a published failure to replicate my
most cited finding that's gotten the most media attention.' You start
worrying about stuff like, 'Are there going to be career repercussions?
Are people going to think less of my other work and stuff I've done?'"

Gervais's story is familiar: Many of us fear we'll be seen as less
competent, less trustworthy, if we admit wrongness. Even when we can see
our own errors --- which, as outlined above, is not easy to do --- we're
hesitant to admit it.

But turns out this assumption is false. As Adam Fetterman, a social
psychologist at the University of Texas El Paso, has found in a few
studies, wrongness admission isn't usually judged harshly. "When we do
see someone admit that they are wrong, the wrongness admitter is seen as
more communal, more friendly," he says. It's almost never the case, in
his studies, "that when you admit you're wrong, people think you are
less competent."

Sure, there might be some people who will troll you for your mistakes.
There might be a mob on Twitter that converges in order to shame you.
Some moments of humility could be humiliating. But this fear must be
vanquished if we are to become less intellectually arrogant and more
intellectually humble.

[[Humility **can't just come from within**]{.mark} --- [we need
**environments** where it can **thrive**]{.mark}]{.underline}

But even if you're motivated to be more intellectually humble, our
culture doesn't always reward it.

The field of psychology, overall, has been reckoning with a "replication
crisis" where many classic findings in the science don't hold up under
rigorous scrutiny. Incredibly influential textbook findings in
psychology --- like the "ego depletion" theory of willpower or the
"marshmallow test" --- have been bending or breaking.

I've found it fascinating to watch the field of psychology deal with
this. For some researchers, the reckoning has been personally
unsettling. "I'm in a dark place," Michael Inzlicht, a University of
Toronto psychologist, wrote in a 2016 blog post after seeing the theory
of ego depletion crumble before his eyes. "Have I been chasing puffs of
smoke for all these years?"

What I've learned from reporting on the "replication crisis" is that
[[**intellectual humility requires** **support** from **peers** and
**institutions**]{.mark}.]{.underline} And that environment is hard to
build.

"What we teach undergrads is that scientists want to prove themselves
wrong," says Simine Vazire, a psychologist and journal editor who often
writes and speaks about replication issues. "But, 'How would I know if I
was wrong?' is actually a really, really hard question to answer. [[It
involves]{.underline}]{.mark} things like [[having **critics yell at
you** and **telling you**]{.mark} that **[you did things
wrong]{.mark}**]{.underline} and reanalyze your data."

And **[[that's not fun]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Again: Even among
scientists --- people who ought to question everything --- [intellectual
humility is **hard**]{.underline}. In some cases, researchers have
refused to concede their original conclusions despite the unveiling of
new evidence. (One famous psychologist under fire recently told me
angrily, "I will stand by that conclusion for the rest of my life, no
matter what anyone says.")

Psychologists are human. When they reach a conclusion, it becomes hard
to see things another way. Plus, the incentives for a successful career
in science push researchers to publish as many positive findings as
possible.

There are two solutions --- among many --- to make psychological science
more humble, and I think we can learn from them.

[One is that [humility needs to be built into]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[standard practices]{.underline}]{.mark} of the science. And [[that
happens through **transparency**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It's becoming
more commonplace for scientists to preregister --- i.e., commit to --- a
study design before even embarking on an experiment. That way, it's
harder for them to deviate from the plan and cherry-pick results. It
also makes sure all data is open and accessible to anyone who wants to
conduct a reanalysis.

That "sort of builds humility into the structure of the scientific
enterprise," Chabris says. "We're not all-knowing and all-seeing and
perfect at our jobs, so [[**we put \[the data\] out there** for **other
people to check**]{.mark} **out**, [to **improve**]{.mark} **upon
[it]{.mark}**[, **come up with new ideas**]{.mark} from and so
on]{.underline}." [**To be** more **intellectually
humble**,]{.underline} [**we need to be** more **transparent about our
knowledge**]{.underline}. [We need to **show others** **what we know**
and **what we don't**]{.underline}.

And two, there needs to be more celebration of failure, and a culture
that accepts it. That includes building safe places for people to admit
they were wrong, like the Loss of Confidence Project.

But it's clear this cultural change won't come easily.

"In the end," Rohrer says, after getting a lot of positive feedback on
the project, "we ended up with just a handful of statements."

We need a balance between convictions and humility

There's a personal cost to an intellectually humble outlook. For me, at
least, it's anxiety.

When I open myself up to the vastness of my own ignorance, I can't help
but feel a sudden suffocating feeling. I have just one small mind, a
tiny, leaky boat upon which to go exploring knowledge in a vast and
knotty sea of which I carry no clear map.

Why is it that some people never seem to wrestle with those waters? That
they stand on the shore, squint their eyes, and transform that sea into
a puddle in their minds and then get awarded for their false certainty?
"I don't know if I can tell you that humility will get you farther than
arrogance," says Tenelle Porter, a University of California Davis
psychologist who has studied intellectual humility.

Of course, following humility to an extreme end isn't enough. You don't
need to be humble about your belief that the world is round. I just
think more humility, sprinkled here and there, would be quite nice.

"It's bad to think of problems like this like a Rubik's cube: a puzzle
that has a neat and satisfying solution that you can put on your desk,"
says Michael Lynch, a University of Connecticut philosophy professor.
Instead, it's a problem "you can make progress at a moment in time, and
make things better. And that we can do --- that we can definitely do."

For a democracy to flourish, Lynch argues, [[we need]{.mark} a
**[balance between convictions]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- our firmly
held beliefs --- [[and **humility**]{.underline}]{.mark}. We need
convictions, because "an apathetic electorate is no electorate at all,"
he says. And we need humility because [we need to **listen to one
another**]{.underline}. Those two things will always be in tension.

The **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** presidency [[suggests there's **too
much conviction** and **not enough humility** in]{.mark} our **[current
culture]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

"The personal question, the existential question that faces you and I
and every thinking human being, is, 'How do you maintain an open mind
toward others and yet, at the same time, keep your strong moral
convictions?'" Lynch says. "That's an issue for all of us."

[To be intellectually humble **doesn't mean giving up on** the **ideas
we**]{.underline} love and [**believe in**. It just means we need to be
**thoughtful** in **choosing** our **convictions**, be **open to
adjusting them**, **seek out their flaws**, and **never stop being
curious** about why we believe what we believe]{.underline}. Again,
that's not easy.

#### It turns case\-\--unlimited topics overstretch negative research burdens and undermines genuine understandings of the affirmatives position for both teams

**Grossberg 15 -** Morris Davis Distinguished Professor University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Lawrence, We All Want to Change the World
THE PARADOX OF THE U.S. LEFT A POLEMIC,
<http://www.lwbooks.co.uk/ebooks/we_all_want_to_change_the_world.pdf>)

I will, in the following description, focus on the situation in the
human sciences (rather than the hard sciences), where [the explosion of
publication creates an ever-expanding circle in which there is always
**too much to read**]{.underline}---[too many positions, too many
arguments, too much contradictory evidence]{.underline}---so that
scholars have to rely on either the author\'s stature or theoretical
and/or political agreement. [[It has become]{.mark}]{.underline} almost
[**[impossible to read everything]{.mark}** one must read]{.underline},
everything necessary to legitimate, at least in traditional terms, the
claim of academic expertise or scholarship. In fact, given this
situation (and its consequences as I will describe below), the most
surprising thing is how much good work continues to be produced.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} situation [[has **serious
consequences**]{.underline}]{.mark}: [First,]{.underline} one\'s
[expertise becomes defined in increasingly narrow terms, resulting in
[the proliferation of]{.mark} sub-fields.]{.underline}9 **\[insert
footnote 9\]** [For example, one might point to [security
studies]{.mark}, surveillance studies, [transition studies, game
studies]{.mark}, code studies, [hip-hop studies, horror studies,]{.mark}
etc.]{.underline} **\[Footnote 9 ends\]** And [[while each of them is
valuable]{.underline}]{.mark} for their interdisciplinary efforts around
a new empirical field, they all too often act as if the questions (and
the realities they interrogate) are new; unfortunately, [they rarely say
anything new or surprising]{.underline}, anything that has not been said
elsewhere. [They frequently simply re-discover in their own empirical
\"pocket\" universe what others have said previously in other
fields]{.underline}. For example, all sorts of technologically defined
sub-fields rediscover the rather old assumption that media audiences are
active. This is partly because, [within each subfield, one gets the
impression of witnessing endless redistributions of a highly
circumscribed set of citations and authors, under a series of
ever-changing terms to describe their]{.underline} fields or
[positions]{.underline}. So, [[academics create]{.underline}]{.mark}
ever shrinking circles in which authors cite a few theoretically and
politically compatible works, and then follow the footnotes, all of
which ultimately lead back to the original authors, creating **[[an
endlessly self-referential closed system of citations,]{.mark} a
numbingly predictable, circular tissue of references]{.underline}**.
[Second, one is less likely to read work that appears tangential but may
nevertheless be absolutely decisive to producing truly interesting and
insightful research]{.underline}. Asking significant questions should
demand that one makes reference to all sorts of concepts and questions
which would lead one to follow other unexpected traditions and lines of
research, since [[any investigation]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., around
questions of participation, publics, or leadership, to use only a few
examples that have irked me recently) [[is likely to open up to an
entire history of]{.mark} problematization, of conversations and
[debates, but]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[who can afford the time and
energy]{.mark} anymore]{.underline}**. [Third, one tends to read only
the most recent work since so much is being published]{.underline}---in
various media---[so rapidly that there is **little time to go back and
read**]{.underline}. [Fourth, one tends to select one\'s sources
according to criteria that have more to do with]{.underline} theoretical
and [political sympathies than with an understanding of research as **a
conversation with difference**]{.underline}. [One reads selectively,
finding those ideas that are already in line with what one assumes one
already knows]{.underline}, and one establishes a body of near-sacred
texts; fifth, one selects topics that are au courant, partly because
there is less scaffolding that one has to build upon and partly because
one\'s work is more likely to gain visibility and impact. Sixth,
**[[complexity goes out the door]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as one
increasingly \"sees the world in a grain of sand]{.underline}.\" One can
no longer be satisfied claiming to have discovered merely a new piece of
a complex puzzle or even an interesting redeployment of an older
practice or structure, because such claims do not bring fame and
glory---either to oneself or the university. Instead, one has to have
discovered the leading edge, the new key or essence. One good but
relatively small idea is expanded into a metonym for the entire economy,
culture or society. Instead of seeking new discursive forms to embody
complexity, uncertainty and humility, one goes with elegance, hyperbole
and the ever receding new.

[The [**results** of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [two **[case
studies]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in this article [suggest]{.mark} that
[**deliberation** **does not**]{.mark} fundamentally **[change
individuals]{.mark}** or inculcate a sense of moral duty]{.underline}.
[The particular **[values]{.mark}** that prevailed in both issues [were
**always present**]{.mark}]{.underline} (and measurable), [**[even
if]{.mark}** they were **[latent]{.mark}**]{.underline} in expressed
preferences. Before deliberation, most participants believed they were
acting in the public interest,69 but good intentions alone are not
sufficient to formulate civic-minded preferences. [**Predeliberative
preferences** were more **strongly influenced** by discourses associated
with **symbolic politics**]{.underline}. Following deliberation,
symbolic cues reduced the "cost" of arriving at a decision,70 but the
cognitive shortcut resulted in positions that did not properly reflect
participants' overall subjectivity.

[Before deliberation, symbolic politics]{.underline}---or at least the
mere presence of potent symbols---**[distorted]{.underline}**
[participants' **preferences**]{.underline}. [This process may be
**manipulative and overt**]{.underline}, as in the case of the
Bloomfield Track, [or **incidental**]{.underline}, as in the case of the
Fremantle Bridge. [**[Deliberation]{.mark}** successfully
**[corrected]{.mark}** [the **influence** of **symbolic
politics**]{.mark} because [it provided]{.mark} both the [**incentive**
and]{.mark} the **[means to develop]{.mark} positions** on an
**intersubjective set** of **recognized issues** that **extended
beyond** the **narrow set** of **unhelpful symbolic ones**]{.underline}.
The mechanism whereby this occurred did not so much involve changing
incentive structures, as predicted by institutional rational choice.71
Rather, [it **changed the decision pathway** [from]{.mark} a [**casual
understanding** of **emotionally appealing content** to a **deeper
understanding**]{.mark}]{.underline} that allowed participants to better
express their own subjectivity. [The change was as much a function of
**stripping away** the impact of **symbolic arguments** as it was due to
participants' **[increased]{.mark} [ability]{.mark}** [and
**willingness** to **deal with issue complexity**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This suggests that [the transformative effect might be more **easily
replicated** in the wider **public sphere** than is
ordinarily]{.underline}

#### 2\-\--Scope\-\--We're predisposed to weigh the [immediate gratification]{.underline} of voting aff higher than the [long-term benefits]{.underline} of better decision-making

**Princeton 4** \[Princeton University Office of Communications. Study:
Brain battles itself over short-term rewards, long-term goals. October
14, 2004. https://pr.princeton.edu/news/04/q4/1014-brain.htm\]

[[Researchers at four universities found]{.mark} two [areas of the
brain]{.mark} that appear to [compete]{.mark} for control over behavior
[when a person attempts to balance **near-term rewards** with
**long-term goals**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The research involved imaging
people\'s brains as they made choices between small but immediate
rewards or larger awards that they would receive later. The study grew
out of the emerging discipline of neuroeconomics, which investigates the
mental and neural processes that drive economic decision-making.

The study was a collaboration between Jonathan Cohen and Samuel McClure
at Princeton\'s Center for the Study of Brain, Mind and Behavior; David
Laibson, professor of economics at Harvard University; and George
Loewenstein, professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon
University. Their study appears in the Oct. 15 issue of Science.

\"This is part of a series of studies we\'ve done that illustrate that
we are rarely of one mind,\" said Cohen, also a faculty member at the
University of Pittsburgh. \"We [have different neural systems that
evolved to solve different types of problems, and our behavior is
dictated by the competition or cooperation between them]{.underline}.\"

The researchers examined a much-studied economic dilemma in which
consumers behave impatiently today but prefer or plan to act patiently
in the future. For example, [people who are offered the choice of \$10
today or \$11 tomorrow are likely to choose to receive the lesser amount
immediately]{.underline}. But [if given a choice between \$10 in one
year or \$11 in a year and a day, people often choose the higher,
delayed amount]{.underline}.

In classic economic theory, this choice is irrational because people are
inconsistent in their treatment of the day-long time delay. Until now,
the cause of this pattern was unclear: Some argued that the brain has a
single decision-making process with a built-in inconsistency, and others
\-- including the authors of the Science paper \-- argued that the
pattern results from the competing influence of two brain systems.

The researchers studied 14 Princeton University students who were asked
to consider delayed reward problems while undergoing functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI), a procedure that shows what parts of the brain
are active at all times. The students were offered choices between
Amazon.com gift certificates ranging from \$5 to \$40 in value and
larger amounts that could be obtained only by waiting some period, from
two weeks to six weeks.

The study showed that [decisions involving the possibility of
**immediate reward** activated parts of the brain influenced heavily by
**neural systems** associated with **emotion**]{.underline}. In
contrast, [all the decisions the students made \-- whether short- or
long-term \-- activated brain systems that are associated with
**abstract reasoning**]{.underline}.

Most important, [when students had the choice of an immediate reward but
chose the delayed option, the calculating regions of their brains were
more strongly activated than their emotion systems. When they chose the
immediate reward, the activity of the two areas was comparable, with a
slight trend toward more activity in the emotion system]{.underline}.

The [researchers concluded]{.underline} that [impulsive choices or
[**preferences for short-term rewards** result from]{.mark} the
**[emotion]{.mark}-related [parts of the brain]{.mark}** [**winning**
out over]{.mark} the **[abstract-reasoning]{.mark} parts**]{.underline}.
\"[There are two different brain systems, and one of them kicks in as
you get really proximate to the reward]{.underline},\" McClure said.

The finding supports the growing view among economists that
psychological factors other than pure reasoning often drive people\'s
decisions.

\"[[Our **emotional brain** has a **hard time imagining the
future**]{.mark}, [even though our **logical brain** **clearly
sees**]{.mark} the **[future consequences]{.mark}** of our current
actions]{.underline},\" Laibson said. \"[Our emotional brain wants to
max out the credit card, order dessert and smoke a cigarette. Our
logical brain knows we should save for retirement, go for a jog and quit
smoking]{.underline}. To understand why we feel internally conflicted,
it will help to know how myopic and forward-looking brain systems value
rewards and how these systems talk to one another.\"

The findings also may cast light on other forms of impulsive behavior
and drug addiction.

\"Our results help explain how and why a wide range of situations that
produce emotional reactions, such as the sight, touch or smell of a
desirable object, often cause people to take impulsive actions that they
later regret,\" Loewenstein said. [[Such]{.mark} psychological
[cues]{.mark} are known to [trigger **dopamine**]{.mark}-related
**[circuits]{.mark}** in the brain [similar to the ones that responded
to **immediate rewards** in the]{.mark} current
[study]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Concerning addiction, said Loewenstein, the findings help explain some
aspects of the problem, such as why addicts become so focused on
immediate gratification when they are craving a drug. The
dopamine-related brain areas that dominated short-term choices among the
study subjects also are known to be activated when addicts are craving
drugs.

#### And it turns case\-\--failure to effectively test the content of the aff undermines the depth of our understanding and makes us unable to determine whether it's content is accurate, which also proves if we win our internal links, the 1AC should be viewed as presumptively false.

Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry wants to clear a few things up regarding
**[["science."]{.underline}]{.mark}** First, he wants to make sure that
we have the definition correct.

If that is what "science" is, [[what is]{.mark} "almost [**everyone"
else** talking about?]{.mark}]{.underline}

> [[To **most**]{.mark} **people**, [**capital-S Science** is]{.mark}

Gobry explains that Aristotle is partially to blame (yes, that
Aristotle.) Aristotle put the cart before the proverbial horse, when it
comes to science.

> Aristotle's definition of science became famous in its Latin
> translation as: rerum cognoscere causas, or, "knowledge of the
> ultimate causes of things." For this, you can often see in manuals

And [it's [this view]{.mark} of science that many people hold until this
day. Which is a problem. Because [it's backwards]{.mark}. [Science means
"**Here's an idea**]{.mark} of how things work. **[Let's test that
idea]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[A lot]{.underline}**]{.mark}. The
outcome of those tests will tell us if that idea is true or not."
Instead, we have people who think science means, "This idea is True.
Smart people believe it's True. I think it's True. Evidence
not-withstanding, this is True."

As Gobry points out, [[science is **not interested** in
"**Truth**."]{.underline} [It's interested in what it can
**prove**]{.underline}]{.mark}[, **[over and over
again]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in a controlled manner. [[It's
**not**]{.mark} a belief or an idea **[chiseled in

brother believes.

[Human [history is not only social]{.mark} history [but]{.mark} also
**[neurobiological]{.mark}** history]{.underline}. [Throughout most of
the 20th century, social and biological explanations were widely viewed
as incompatible]{.underline}. However, from the 1990s, the emergence of
social neuroscience6 vindicates Aristotle's pioneering deductions. The
young [[science]{.mark} accepts that the brain is a single, pivotal
component of an undeniably social species and that it is orderly in its
complexity]{.underline}. [It [treats the]{.mark} human [brain as a
social organ]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [whose]{.underline}]{.mark}
[physiological and [neurological reactions are]{.mark} directly and
profoundly [shaped by social interaction]{.mark}]{.underline}. (To a
mammal, being socially connected to caregivers is indispensable for
survival: this, incidentally, suggests that Abraham Maslow's hierarchy
of needs might need to be revised to ascribe more weight to social
needs, e.g., love and belonging, and esteem, in relation to
self-actualization.) Nondualistic and nonreductionistic, [[social
