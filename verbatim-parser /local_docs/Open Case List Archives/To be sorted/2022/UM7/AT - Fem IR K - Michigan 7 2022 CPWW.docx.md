#### Women are being taking more seriously now and not seen as the victims -- UN actions prove

Security, pgs. 103-104 /// MF)

Although part of a longer and wider struggle for women's security from
militarized violence, the NGO Working Group on Women and International
Peace and Security, consisting of the century-old WILPF, the Women's
Caucus for Gender Justice, Amnesty International, International Alert,
the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, and the Hague
Appeal for Peace in collaboration with UNIFEM, is credited with the fi
nal push to have the [UN Security Council pass Resolution 1325 in
2000]{.underline} (Cohn 2008: 187). Although non-binding, [1325 "calls
on" the UN and member countries to do the following: protect women from
gender-based violence (GBV) in war zones and include women (and gender
perspectives) in peace negoti-ations, support their peacemaking
initiatives in addition to providing gender-sensitive train-ing to
peacekeepers, and engage in gender mainstreaming through UN monitoring
of and reporting on the gender dimensions of confl ict and confl ict
resolution, including the impact of armed confl ict on women and girls
and the roles of women in peacemaking.]{.underline} As noted in Chapter
1 , this is part of the larger UN Women, Peace, and Security (WPS)
agenda, which promotes the implementation of such resolutions, including
the development of national action plans on women, peace, and security.
12 [Within the context of this, TFNs have also been successful in having
GBV included in the 2013 Arms Trade Treaty that obligates ratifying
countries to ensure that the small arms they export are not used to
conduct widespread GBV]{.underline} (Enloe 2014: 27).

However, the eff ects of 1325 have been muted at best. Widespread rapes
in the DRC con-fl ict as well as in the Darfur genocide in Sudan and
increased reports of rape by peacekeeping forces were featured in
subsequent UN secretary-general studies and reports on women, peace, and
security that were mandated by 1325. [This acknowledgment of worsening
gender violence in war led to the passage of additional UN Security
Council resolutions that codify sexual violence as a matter of peace and
security, call for the development and strengthening of measures to
address sexual violence and to have more women present in peace
operations and negotiations, mandate tracking of the implementation of
1325 and documenting of "credibly suspected" perpetrators of sexual
violence in armed confl icts, and make HIV/AIDS resulting from sexual
violence in armed confl icts a focus in peacekeeping and peacebuilding
processes]{.underline} (DeLargy 2013).

[These resolutions, which have been the fi rst to address women and,
most notably, women as security actors rather than only as victims in
the history of the Security Council]{.underline} (Enloe 2007: 129), were
preceded by the formation of international criminal tribunals for former
Yugoslavia (ICTY) and Rwanda (ICTR) in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Rape
was fi rst prosecuted by a World War II military tribunal that found
several Japanese commanders responsible for systematic rapes in Nanking,
and the 1946 Fourth Geneva Convention and 1974 UN Declaration on the
Protection of Women and Children in Emergency and Armed Confl ict speak
amorphously to protecting women from war violence (Oosterveld 2005:
68--69). However, the ICTY and ICTR were the fi rst tribunals to begin
developing international case law and precedents that spell out a wide
range of gender violence (including gender violence perpetrated against
men) that is prosecutable as a crime of war and a tool of genocide
(Oosterveld 2005: 79). 13By 1998, these were codifi ed in the Rome
Statute of the ICC, which recognizes multiple forms of gender violence
in armed confl ict as crimes against humanity and war crimes, and
requires gender-sensitive judges and court proceedings that do not
retraumatize victims (Oosterveld 2005: 67).

### perm

#### Current practices of working within the state prove that the perm -- incorporating research into policy -- works best

Global Politics, pg 46 /// MF)

[Recent generations of feminist IR researchers (some of whom have worked
in or with international agencies) also engage in a signifi cant amount
of quantitative research to have a greater and more meaningful impact on
international policymaking]{.underline} (Den Boer 2016). Although
feminist IR scholars have long relied on governmental, non-governmental,
and UN gender-diff erentiated data produced during and continuously
since the UN Decade for Women (which are also used in this text), but
knowing how incomplete and insuffi cient this most often statistical
information can be, some are now producing extensive and continuously
expanded and updated databases, such as WomanStats (see Box 2.1 ). [Some
have also engaged in large-scale studies, drawing upon existing, and
creating new, databases, on the impact of international policymaking on
women and the relationship between women's status and global problems.
For example, in the last decade, such research has showed that women's
literacy, access to reproductive health services, and employment have
increased in states that have ratifi ed and observed CEDAW, most
markedly in secular states with eff ective legal systems]{.underline}
(Simmons 2009), and that the higher the level of violence against women
within a state, the higher the likelihood it will engage in war, with
violence against women rates being more signifi cant than levels of
democracy, religion, wealth, and racial disparities as predictors of
state peacefulness or bellicosity (Hudson et al. 2008/9). Such research
is positivist to the degree that it treats gender (as well as race,
class, nationality, and so on) as a variable, operationalizing it often
as female sex and women's rights in relation to a host of other
variables. [While this has yielded major fi ndings which tell us gender
not only matters, but centrally matters in global politics,]{.underline}
fem-inist IR researchers cannot control if and how policymakers make use
of such fi ndings, nor does it particularly challenge the preference for
positivist, quantitative measures in inter-national policymaking.

### alt fails 

#### Viewing things thorough with a gender lens fails -- empirically proven

Anne **Runyan**, 20**19** (Runyan, professor in the School of Public and

Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in

In my work with V. Spike Peterson over several editions of Global Gender
Issues between 1993 and 2014 and in my most recent [Global Gender
Politics](https://www.routledge.com/Global-Gender-Politics-5th-Edition/Runyan/p/book/9780813350851)[, I
came to make a distinction between a gender lens, which foregrounds
masculine and feminine dynamics through which hierarchical dichotomies
are naturalized and enforced in world politics, and a gendered lens,
which attends to the ways in which race, class, sexual, and national
power relations intersect with gender power relations to produce
multiple, differing, and shifting femininities and
masculinities.]{.underline} A gendered lens is necessary for seeing how
gender combines in complex ways with other structural power relations,
such as colonialism, imperialism, racism, and economic and environmental
exploitation, to normalize a range of social, political, and economic
divisions, inequalities, and injustices.

A gendered lens also resists the reduction of gender to "adding women"
as is popular and problematic in policymaking circles. [And it alerts us
to the work that gender does, especially when deployed in this fashion,
to cover up and smooth over what Spike and I termed global and systemic
crises of representation, insecurity, and sustainability. An exemplar of
how this works, which I address in the postscript of the second edition
of [Gender and Global
Restructuring](https://www.routledge.com/Gender-and-Global-Restructuring-Sightings-Sites-and-Resistances-2nd/Marchand-Sisson-Runyan/p/book/9780415776806),
is in the case of the immediate aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis,
when increasing the number of risk-averse women financial managers was
briefly trumpeted as a panacea for avoiding such crises in future,
relying on biologically determinist constructions of women saviors from
testosterone-fueled men. This discursive move (which did not result in
any serious material change in the gender make-up of financial services
personnel) served to sidestep critical analysis of the systemic nature
and costs of gendered financialization.]{.underline}

#### There are weaknesses within a gendered lens 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Introduction, pg 24///
MF)

The gender(ed), or intersectional feminist, lenses that arise from
feminist in combination with other critical perspectives on global
politics are applied to the traditional categories of global politics
inquiry: global governance ( Chapter 3 ), global security ( Chapter 4 ),
and global political economy ( Chapter 5 ). It is within these chapters
that historical and contemporary gender(ed) divisions of power,
violence, and labor and resources and the global crises of
representation, insecurity, and sustainability they spawn are fl eshed
out empirically and ana-lytically. The employment of multiple feminist
perspectives and the empirical research they are generating foregrounds
the substantial body of work that now exists in feminist IR, 6which is
contributing to, as well as based on, data now being produced by IGOs
and NGOs on the gender(ed) eff ects of global political priorities,
processes, and institutions and attempts to ameliorate them. [The
diversity of feminist IR thought and research also aff ords more
com-plex and sometimes confl icting gender or gendered analyses of
global politics.]{.underline} The benefi ts of this diversity are that
it militates against resorts to "quick fi xes" that can do more harm
than good and ensures no single or hegemonic analysis that forecloses
debate and further investigation within feminist inquiry. [At the same
time, weaknesses in feminist inquiry and appropriations of gender
analysis in policymaking are raised when they fail to address the
gendered power relations among women and among men that forestall more
comprehensive critiques and resistances to processes that widen and
deepen global and local inequalities.]{.underline}

#### Adding women is the best first step -- not the alt

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Gender(ed) Lenses on
Global Politics, pgs 42-43/// MF)

[Asking initially "Where are the women?" and subsequently "adding
women"---and com-paring their positions to those of men---were and
remain productive orientations. They make embodied women (and men)
visible in our picture of world politics, illuminate how women and men
are diff erently engaged with and aff ected by international politics,
and reveal women as agents and activists, as well as victims of
sociocultural, economic, and political oppres-sions.]{.underline} But
adding women to existing paradigms also raised deeper questions by
exposing how the conceptual structures themselves presuppose masculine
experience and perspective. For example, women/femininity cannot simply
be added to constructions that are constituted as masculine: the public
sphere, rationality, political identity, objectivity, "economic man."
Either women as feminine cannot be added (e.g., women must become like
men) or the con-structions themselves are transformed (e.g., adding
women as feminine alters the masculine premise of the constructions and
changes their meaning). In this sense, the exclusions of fem-ininity are
not accidental or coincidental but rather are required for the
analytical consistency of reigning explanatory frameworks.

#### Feminist perspectives in IR come from a variety of different sources -- the K homogenizes these view points and fem has existed for 50 years, they should've solved already or the impacts should've happened

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Gender(ed) Lenses on
Global Politics, pgs 40-41/// MF)

[Over a half-century since feminist studies emerged and became
institutionalized in the academy, feminist scholarship is now produced
within and across most academic disciplines. Both within and outside IR,
feminist critiques have altered disciplinary givens, challenged
conventional explanations, and expanded the reach of intellectual
inquiry]{.underline}. As noted earlier, feminists share a commitment to
investigating gendered inequalities and to improving the conditions of
women's lives. [But neither feminists nor women constitute a homogeneous
category, and there is no single meaning of feminism. Like theoretical
lenses or perspectives in IR, feminist approaches vary and have been
characterized in a number of ways. 1 Most importantly, endless mixing is
the rule, not the exception, so assuming that lenses constitute discrete
"boxes" misrepresents the diversity, the range, and especially the
extensive overlap among many perspectives. Individuals make assumptions
that may be common to various lenses, they may make diff erent
assumptions when focusing on diff erent substantive topics or normative
issues, and how assumptions are mixed is an eff ect of learning,
objectives, experience, and context.]{.underline} With these thoughts in
mind, the following presents a very brief introduction to feminist
lenses, especially those applied in the context of IR work, though
transgressing the conventional boundaries of it.

### Essentialism 

#### A new way of looking into policy making can strategically play on essentialism 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Gender and Global
Security, pgs 85-86/// MF)

[As argued in this chapter, the power of gender obscures and militates
against the potential alliances between diverse women and men and among
them across borders to resist war and other forms of violence. In the
process, this chapter problematizes dominant constructions of
security,]{.underline} examines the strategy of "adding women" to
security structures and policies, desta-bilizes assumptions undergirding
the gendered divisions of violence, and takes on contempo-rary forces
that are expanding the crisis of insecurity. [It is critical of
"solutions" that put peacemaking and peacebuilding solely on the backs
of poorly resourced and marginalized women and vilify only certain men
to defl ect attention away from elites]{.underline} (including some
women) who promote militarism and war in the name of security. [But it
also sees some value in what has been called "strategic essentialism"
(Spivak 1987), which refers to the way groups of people like "women,"
who are, in reality, non-homogeneous, have diverse experiences, and have
multiple and even confl icting interests, can still make political
claims as a group on the basis of what they perceive as their shared
perspectives and conditions on the understanding that the commonalities
they identify and strategically mobilize to make political demands for
change are not timeless or the result of innate traits. As such,
strategic essentialism constitutes a political strategy for diverse
women to articulate interests in and paths to peace and act together
(with supportive men) to bring about disarmed security.]{.underline}

#### "Solutions" place the responsibility on women and absolve all others of blame

### Backlash

#### Alt is already happening now and it causes backlash

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Introduction, pg 1///
MF)

Why does gender matter in global politics? What difference does it make
to view global politics through a gendered lens? What becomes visible
when we see "international relations" as interconnected relations of
inequality---among genders, races, classes, sexualities, and
nationalities---as opposed to simply interactions between and among
self-interested states? What are the costs of being inattentive to
gendered dynamics in global politics for addressing a myriad of world
problems that ultimately aff ect us all?

In this introductory chapter, an overview is presented of the
contemporary relationships between gender and global politics. It begins
with a conceptual discussion of gender as a dichotomous power relation
and normative ordering power, referred to as the power of gen-der , a
meta-lens that fosters dichotomization, stratifi cation, and
depoliticization in thought and action through the processes of
masculinization and feminization , thereby sustaining global power
structures and crises that prevent, militate against, or reverse
meaningful advances in social equality and justice. It then addresses
why adopting not only a gender lens , but more importantly a gendered
lens , informed by intersectional thinking, is important for
understanding how the gender interacts with other power relations, such
as race, class, sexuality, and nationality (including power relations
among nations as well as those based on national origin) to produce both
gender and gendered divisions of power , violence , and labor and
resources in global governance, global security, and global political
economy, the principal areas of inquiry in the study of International
Relations (IR). These divisions, in turn, keep in place and exacerbate
the crises of representation, insecurity, and sustainability in global
politics, which are also introduced.

[In the remainder of this introductory chapter, how gender politics
became more salient in national and international policymaking in recent
decades is raised. A host of international institutions have been
adopting some understandings produced by gender-centered research in IR
that make links between raising the status of women worldwide and
addressing global crises, including democratic deficits, armed conflict
and other violence, and poverty and environmental degradation. However,
as also raised, the deepening of such crises has also led to a backlash
not only against international institutions, but also with respect to
nascent attention to women's rights with the recent rise of ethnic,
economic, and belligerent nationalisms in several parts of the world.
This rise of such new authoritarianisms associated with "strong man"
politics, as also pointed out, is also a feature of contemporary global
gender politics.]{.underline} Thus, a gendered lens is required to
better understand these conflicting responses to global crises and the
insufficiencies and problematics of both to address them.

### Biotech

#### Advances in biotech helps promote equality for women -- it doesn't make them more marginalized or reinforce hierarchies -- proven by reproductive health 

Alex **Zhavoronkov**, 20**22** (Zhavoronkov, author, writer of over 150
peer-reviewed journals and an expert in AI in relation to healthcare,

/// MF)

Evolution is a great concept. As AI scientists we use it all the time to
develop better algorithms rewarding and punishing them according to
their actions in simulated environments. But when nature does it to us
it feels very cruel. Our objective is to master our environment,
compete, reproduce, take care of our young, the young of our young, and
then gracefully decline and die. And when it comes to females nature is
especially unfair as they carry much of the burden of reproduction and
caring for the young. And while males can reproduce almost as long as
they can live, the female reproductive period is limited and while they
generally live longer, after reaching menopause they need to adjust to
the new realities as their bodies shift gears. 

Aging is generally unfair but it is especially unfair to women.

By 20 weeks, a female fetus has a fully developed reproductive system;
by the time this fetus is born, she will have approximately one million
eggs. Yet, by the age of 30 a woman will have lost 90 percent of those
eggs. What's more, by the time a woman is 40 years old, roughly three
percent of a woman's eggs remain. As time continues on, this
girl-turned-woman ages and so do her ovaries, but at a pace five times
faster than any other human organ. Menopause lurks around the corner,
with the onset between the ages of 40 and 60. This brings an onslaught
of unfavorable symptoms including but not limited to fatigue, anxiety,
vaginal dryness, and low libido. A taboo of a topic. [Fact is, there's
not a lot about women's reproductive health that is not taboo. From
painful menstrual cycles to assisted fertility, to menopause, women
suffer, and often suffer alone. ]{.underline}

To make matters worse, there are serious medical consequences of
menopause that go beyond "symptoms." Menopause causes medical diseases
including osteoporosis, heart disease, and dementia.

Whether female or not, nearly everyone can relate to being ill. However,
the severity of illness caused by a complex amalgamation of hormonal
changes that has been historically beyond a woman's control is likely
hard to relate to unless having lived experience. But female-related
struggles do not cease at the health level, the issues permeate beyond a
diagnosis. 

Women are accustomed to either a healthcare provider or family member
discussing fertility in some capacity. They may be informed about the
"decrease in chances" of conception that comes with age; or, the higher
probability of a genetic disorder for their unborn child should they
choose to wait much longer to become pregnant. This pressure is fueled
by an underlying fear -- a fear that all women possess in some way. The
ticking "biological clock" chimes louder with each year and women are
met with a decision they feel they must make -- and soon. It can consume
a mind: What if I waited too long and can no longer have children? How
can I balance my career and my family? Should I freeze my eggs? 

[It's fairly possible that by the time a woman finishes college, earns
well-deserved promotions, builds a career, establishes financial
stability, or demonstrates exceptional emotional maturity, she may have
been failed by her ovaries. Critical career moments seemingly coincide
with the time in a woman's life when she needs to decide whether or not
to have children. This has women caught in the crossroads of compromise.
Or, the reality might spark an interest in leveraging an alternative
method. ]{.underline}

The technology of egg freezing has existed since the 1980s; however, in
the past decade, technological advances have improved the efficacy of
the method. Even so, the process of freezing eggs is cost-prohibitive
and only a small percentage of corporations offer it as a medical
benefit. Beyond the cost alone, the success rates are not overwhelming.
While different fertility clinics vary on the percent of successful
pregnancies, the average is 20%.

[Much can be accomplished in a lifetime, especially since our life
expectancy is increasing. If a woman's average [life
expectancy](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/VSRR10-508.pdf) is 80
years in the United States, is it not peculiar that her family planning
needs to be achieved by her 30s]{.underline}? This point is dramatized
when looking at men's capability to produce sperm (spermatogenesis)
throughout a lifetime without the existence of premature reproductive
aging. [If overall life expectancy is increasing, and it has
consistently over the past decade, we must realize that without
extending female reproductive life, we are worsening gender
inequality. ]{.underline}

[In recent years, the phenomenon of opting out of bearing children has
burgeoned]{.underline}. In fact, the Census Bureau accounts for the
United States having the [slowest
increase](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/21/united-states-population-growth-2021-525832#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20population%20grew%20just,from%20the%20U.S.%20Census%20Bureau.) in
population since the Bureau began making population estimates in the
18th century. From 2020 to 2021 year, the United States population grew
only 0.1 percent. [This is a significant socioeconomic
concern.]{.underline}

We have witnessed this unraveling at the seams amidst the COVID-19
pandemic. Since September 2021 alone, [300,00 women have [left the
workforce](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/14/more-than-300000-women-left-the-labor-force-in-september-.html).
As people have been pushed to work remotely, women have reportedly
assumed the responsibility for both domestic work and childcare. It is
no mystery as to why women are departing their places of work, as
detrimental as it may be.]{.underline} These cumulative departures over
the past two years will be costly to the United States economy, costing
around [\$650
billion](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2021/08/women-s-workforce-exits-cost-us-economy-650b-an.html?page=all#:~:text=A%20new%20report%20details%20the,National%20Partnership%20for%20Women%20%26%20Families.) each
year. [These departures also threaten women's financial independence and
set back the clock on pay equity. Women are more aware than ever that
the social construction of "having it all" may very well be false. The
cards seem stacked against women both in health and in career
parity. ]{.underline}

But it is not all doom and gloom -- [there are women writing a new
chapter for their time on this earth, just as women have done before
them. But this time, it involves money. ]{.underline}

[While the richest men in the world may be worth trillions, women have
shattered enough glass to be worth billions, and they're putting it to
good use. Women's wealth is increasing as the recent [Forbes America's
Richest Self-Made Women
article](https://www.forbes.com/self-made-women/) demonstrated by the
notable cutoff increase to \$225mm: a \$75mm increase. ]{.underline}

[These women have earned their stripes as founders, co-founders, CEOs,
public figures, artists, and much more]{.underline}, and many are taking
a stand for women by making impactful decisions about their employees'
health care choices, as demonstrated by [Whitney
Wolfe](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/03/1033980404/texas-abortion-ban-bumble-match-funds).
Others, such as Anne Wojcicki, have taken successful
healthcare [companies
public](https://twitter.com/BW/status/1456235796214730760/photo/1),
while simultaneously acting as a lead investor in the female
reproductive and fertility space. [Women are starting new venture firms,
creating powerful networks, and are investing in companies with female
leadership. ]{.underline}

It makes sense women are investing in companies that serve women. It's a
true demonstration of women supporting women. And getting older is no
longer a deterrent, instead, it's a second life. From the comeback of
Sex & the City to the influx of Botox use, to in vitro fertilization
(IVF), [women are creating their options rather than waiting for better
options to come their way.]{.underline} Consider Viagra. This was a
problem worth solving for men and thus scientists pursued solutions.
Have we thought about the female equivalent of Viagra? What if just as
erectile dysfunction can be circumvented, so too can menopause? 

[What is surprising, is that there are very few research institutions
and companies going after female reproductive longevity and
inequality.]{.underline} I personally got interested in the field when
Nicole Shanaghan, at that time the founder and CEO of ClearAccessIP, an
AI-powered IP management company that helped manage the IP of Insilico
Medicine, got into this field from the philanthropic angle. That was
around 2017-2018. She helped establish the research institutes on this
subject at [The Buck Institute for Research on Aging, and at the
National University of Singapore. The Buck is, without doubt, the most
reputable and productive non-profit research institution focusing
exclusively on aging and with support from BiaEcho, their brilliant CEO,
Dr. Eric Verdin set up a research center in record time.]{.underline}
The center is now led by Jennifer Garrison, who I hope to interview for
one of the follow-up articles. 

However, on the commercial front, the situation is even bleaker. [I
would not be able to name even a dozen companies aiming to extend female
reproductive longevity]{.underline}. It is not easy to start a company
in this field. [It requires very specific talent and experience,
established animal models, regulatory pathways, expert investors, and
pharmaceutical partners]{.underline}. It resembles the field of
AI-powered drug discovery in 2013. 

To understand this field a bit better, I recently chatted about this
topic with [Dina Radenkovic,
MD](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexzhavoronkov/2021/01/11/women-in-longevity-medicine-dr-dina-radenkovic/?sh=417d2742b444),
a longevity physician and entrepreneur, who has recently revealed her
new company [Gameto](https://gametogen.com/). And while I do not know
much about their technology and can not make any claims in this area,
the team looks impressive. Dina joined forces with Martin Varsavsky, a
leader in the fertility space and founder of Prelude Fertility and
Overture Life. Gameto is women-backed with six female investors:

Tigipko of TA Ventures and Caterina Fake of Yes VC. [As a medical doctor
with a background in aging, Dina is intent to position Gameto as a
company redefining the narrative around female reproductive longevity
and making it more around health and longevity. Gameto is applying the
advances of cellular reprogramming to offer solutions for both menopause
and fertility. This may just offer the optionality women are looking for
and Dina hopes they might be able to make women suffer fewer health
problems in their later life. ]{.underline}

"When ovaries are termed 'geriatric' by many traditional medical
criteria, the rest of the body is certainly not and this creates
conflict for people pushing them to make compromises they may not wish
to make. [I hope our technology can in the future empower women and also
make the second half of our lives, the best one.]{.underline}" said Dr.
Dina Radenkovic, CEO of Gameto.

Every woman has a unique story to be told, but it is the cumulation of
these stories that evoke fundamental change about how women choose to
live. A selection of Gameto investors chose to share their sentiments on
the essentiality of investment in women's reproductive health --

"[Women\'s health is one of the highest potential and most important
investment areas. It\'s been underfunded, and because of the
acceleration of science/tech, now is the time. Gameto combines a
powerful mission to make the biological clock option with strong
science.]{.underline}" Said Kristina Simmons, Founder & Managing Partner
of Overwater Ventures who previously worked at Lululemon and Khosla
Ventures. 

Deborah Jackson, CEO of [Plum Alley](https://plumalley.co/), a venture
capital firm formed by previous Wall St. executives who are backing
women in STEMM -- such as Jennifer Doudna, Co-Founder of Mammoth
Biosciences and Mary Lou Japsen, CEO of Openwater -- shared, \"The
health of a woman\'s ovary is one of the fundamental drivers of her
health over her lifetime, in addition to giving her the ability to
conceive and make healthy offspring. [As a woman, mother of two adult
daughters and investor in frontier technologies, I have long been
searching for breakthroughs that prioritize the uniqueness and
brilliance of the female body. If we prevent disease and extend healthy
living for women because of the work of Gameto, we will make one of the
most profound scientific advances that is possible for all of
humanity.\"]{.underline}

Deena Shakir, Partner at Lux Capital and investor in Gameto, recently
wrote about this topic
in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/deenashakir/2021/12/16/4-predictions-from-top-vcs-for-womens-health-in-2022/?sh=ecd9e364e8da) and
it seems her predictions may be coming true. She has shared that,
\"[Transformative innovations in women's and family health not only
advance health equity, but can also improve individual family finances
and contribute more broadly to economic productivity.\"]{.underline}

"Beyond the clear need in IVF/oocyte freezing, we are deeply excited
about the prospect of a better standard of care for women undergoing
menopause. The suffering caused by menopause is not a biological
imperative, and the many complications that come along with menopause,
particularly early-onset menopause, can be entirely avoided." - Maryanna
Saenko and Steve Jurvetson of Future Ventures venture fund that led
Gameto's series A and backed an aging company [Cambrian
Biopharma](https://www.cambrianbio.com/) as well as Neuralink, Deep
Genomics and [Space X](https://www.spacex.com/).

While Gameto is still in the early days, solving the problem of
accelerated ovarian aging for women's health and equality is a worthy
cause, and a problem worth discussing.  

[There is a new season of women bound together by life experiences and
by the realized necessity of optionality. The option of having a
successful career without foregoing having children. The option to
leverage biotechnology for relief from menopause or infertility. The
option to discuss reproductive health without being shamed or
silenced.]{.underline}

#### Women have supported wars in the past -- empirically proven and not questioning their role subjects them to being more controlled by the men around them 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and

Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in

[Both kinds of political motherhood are at work in the fact that women
have historically supported wars (both imperialist wars and wars of
national liberation) and fought in them, often in the name of
maternalism.]{.underline} Sending sons and daughters to war can be seen
as a patri-otic motherly duty, and fi ghting in wars can be seen as a
form of motherly protection of the homeland or mothering in a new nation
(Elshtain 1987[). At the same time, many women have become soldiers out
of economic necessity or sought gender equality in soldiering as a
ticket to full citizenship and a path to public power for women. Thus,
the idea that women are either naturally or socially geared for peace
has been put in question and can be an impediment, particularly in cases
of state-led political motherhood, to women seeking gen-der equality
because it bars them from or marginalizes them in militaries that
control signif-icant resources and are particularly valorized in the
stories of nations and the fabric of national life. This produces a
"gendered nationalism" in which only men who forged a nation in blood
get to defi ne what that nation is, regardless of whether women spilled
blood for it or on its altar as (fewer) combatants or (many)
non-combatants, and regardless of the many other contributions that
women make to (re)producing and sustaining the life of a
nation]{.underline} (Enloe 1989: 63). [When women are seen only as the
symbols and the reproducers of the nation, not as agents in its
narratives, then they become subject to an array of controls over their
bodies and their beings by men of the nation]{.underline} (Kaufman and
Williams 2007: 16--18; Yuval-Davis 1997).
