The **[celebration of NATO]{.underline}**'s 70 years of existence
[provides]{.underline} another [opportunity to unearth]{.underline} the
[**real history** of]{.underline} the [ideas]{.underline}, [practices
and destruction wrought by]{.underline} this [military
alliance]{.underline}. [[Even with]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[clear]{.mark} exposure of]{.underline} the [[cooperation between
NATO]{.underline}, [the CIA and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [British [MI6
to spread **terror**]{.mark} [and **psychological
warfare**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Europe immediately after the formation
of this military alliance, the [[mainstream media]{.underline},
[academics and policy makers]{.underline}]{.mark} [[remain silent
on]{.underline}]{.mark} activities of the 'stay behind armies' and
'[**[false flag]{.underline}**'
[op]{.underline}]{.mark}[eration[s]{.mark} [that
distorted]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[real]{.mark} causes of
[insecurity]{.mark} in the world]{.underline} after 1945. The [evidence
of]{.underline} the [[manipulations]{.mark} of the peoples of the world
to ensure]{.underline} the [[**continued survival** of
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} has been [**well documented** in]{.underline}
the [[**fraudulent interventions** and bombings in the
Balkans]{.underline}]{.mark} right up the [present [multiple wars
against]{.mark}]{.underline} [the]{.mark} [peoples of
[Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Vijay Prashad had identified [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} as [[the
**prime defender** of the]{.mark} Atlantic project]{.underline}. This
Atlantic project, he noted was, "[a]{.underline} fairly straightforward
[[campaign]{.mark} by the propertied classes]{.underline}
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [[maintain or restore]{.underline}]{.mark}
their [[position of dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}." This Atlantic
Project was anchored in the military alliance called [NATO]{.underline}
with its principal work, that of **[[reversing the South
Project]{.underline}]{.mark}**; the [[struggles for peace bread and
justice by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[poorer citizens]{.mark} of the
planet]{.underline}, especially those who had emerged on the world stage
after the decolonization of Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} [**ostensive [reason]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}
the [founding]{.mark} of [NATO was]{.mark} to]{.underline}
[']{.mark}[thwart]{.underline}' [Soviet aggression]{.underline}, [but in
practice the organization was [a prop for **western**]{.mark}
**[capital]{.mark}**]{.underline} and after the fall of the Berlin Wall,
became the core prop for Wall Street. In this year, there will be many
commentaries on the fact that the existence of NATO reflects a Cold War
relic, that NATO is obsolete and lost its mandate, but very few will
[link]{.underline} the [expansion of NATO to]{.underline} the
[**military management** of the international system]{.underline}. Prior
to 1991, [the planners of [NATO could justify]{.mark} the existence of
NATO on [ideological and political grounds, but with the]{.mark} [threat
of a multi polar world]{.mark} and the diminution of the dollar, [NATO
expanded to]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}the point where this author
joined with others in labelling this organization Global NATO to
[[reflect its]{.mark} **current [imperial
mandate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Global thrust of NATO now comprises
29 members from Europe and North America along with 41 'partners' that
had [started off under the banner of]{.underline} the North Atlantic
[Cooperation]{.underline} Council (NACC) in 1991. [Since that
time]{.underline}, [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[launched a lengthy
war]{.underline}]{.mark} without end [[in]{.mark}
[Afghanistan]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [colluded in]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[the]{.underline} [destruction of Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
[conspired with **militarists**]{.mark}]{.underline} to forge
'Partnership for Peace' (with most members of the former Warsaw Pact
states). The core 29 members are now enmeshed with treaties and
undertakings from states involved in the Mediterranean Dialog and
Istanbul Cooperation Initiative: Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and United Arab
Emirates. There are also the 'partners' from across the globe:
Afghanistan, Australia, Colombia, Iraq, Japan, Republic of Korea,
Mongolia, New Zealand and Pakistan. This enlargement served the military
purposes of encircling China and Russia who military planners in the
West targeted.

There is [**no shortage** of literature on NATO]{.underline} and its
[milestones]{.underline}, [but **very [few]{.mark}**]{.underline} have
[[documented]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[real crimes
of]{.underline}]{.mark} this [global network of]{.underline}
anticommunist [[operatives who precipitated **real terror**]{.mark} and
psychological warfare [against]{.mark}]{.underline} the [citizens of
[Europe and North America while]{.mark} [supporting **mass atrocities**
from Algeria to]{.mark} Indonesia]{.underline}, and [[South
Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}. Books such as that of NATO's Secret Armies:
Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe by Danielle Ganser and
The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and Their Secret World
War, by Stephen Kinzer [used **rigorous research
techniques**]{.underline} to [uncover]{.underline} the [**dark history**
of NATO]{.underline}. These two books can be distinguished from the
[**bland** **i**nternational **r**elations]{.underline} texts that
[discusses NATO inside]{.underline} the old calculations of
'[strategy]{.underline},' '[concert of democracies]{.underline}',
'**[security cooperation]{.underline}**' and the [balance of
power]{.underline},' [and **s**pheres **o**f **i**nfluence]{.underline}.
Most recently, this IR rendering of the history of NATO has been served
up in a document entitled, NATO at Seventy: An Alliance in Crisis.
Published by Harvard University with one of the coauthors being a former
US ambassador to NATO. This document spelt out ten challenges.\[1\]
However, in a testimony before Congress, Nicolas Burns boiled down the
challenge of NATO to one objective; that the current role of NATO must
be to contain Russia and China.\[2\] On the day before the actual
70thanniversary, on April 3, the Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
delivered an address to a joint session of the US Congress advocating an
expansion of the alliance while promoting a military buildup against
Russia. \[3\] European progressives will have to reflect deeply on
whether the current sanctions regime and the special propose vehicle
called the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), is
ushering in another round of inter imperialist rivalry reminiscent of
the currency wars of 1929-1939. Then, the shifting alliances yielded
confusion among working peoples who ultimately went to fight against
each other in Europe, spreading barbarism throughout the world, from
Auschwitz to Hiroshima.

The continued struggles for bread, peace and justice ensure that it is
only the authoritarian leaders from [[the **Global
South**]{.underline}]{.mark} who [[are compromised
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[real]{.mark} [meaning]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} the **existence of [NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the
present era, there is a [new capitalist competition]{.underline} while
North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([NATO]{.underline}) [serves as
[an]{.mark} [**integral part** of the]{.mark} Pentagon's **[world
command structure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Recent
experiences]{.underline} have [demonstrated]{.underline} in
[Afghanistan]{.underline}, [Iraq]{.underline} and [Libya]{.underline}
that the **[[moguls]{.mark} of Wall Street [are willing to wage as many
wars]{.mark}, to [destroy as many countries]{.mark} and to [kill as many
people as necessary to achieve the]{.mark} [dominance of US
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The [destruction of Libya was a
classic example]{.underline} of the convergence of finance as warfare,
the weaponization of information and incessant bombing to destroy a
society. Where at the start of NATO the [[war scare]{.underline}]{.mark}
was [the **[propaganda]{.mark} method**]{.underline}, [In the **current
digital age**]{.underline}, [[brain]{.mark} [hacking
and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[engineering of]{.underline}]{.mark} smart
phones have placed the **[[giant technology]{.underline}]{.mark}** firms
of Apple , Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook [[at the forefront
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[new weapons platform]{.mark}** of
NATO]{.underline} and Wall Street. [[This]{.underline}
[analysis]{.underline} [is]{.underline}]{.mark} in three parts
[[spelling out the rationale for]{.underline}]{.mark} the call for
[**all progressive forces** to join together to concentrate]{.underline}
their [energies in the **[dismantling of
NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

#### The 1AC extends the expansion of warfighting's newest terrain: Human brains --- their obsession with hacking and weaponizing cognition as a new frontier of great power warfare is a mode of neuro-geopolitical entanglement that annihilates value to life through a regime of cognitive discipline. 

#### Cognition has become the newest battlefield -- subtle disciplinary strategies create a neuro-geopolitical entanglement

This is the terror that keeps Jürgen Habermas up at night. What will we
do if we discover our freedom is contingent, that our very nature can
change?31 The plan of the rest of this chapter is to follow Malabou's
provocation through to the heart of that terror. However, unlike
Habermas and others, I hope to do so without the sentimental attachment
to a humanity that never existed. Rather, I want to push Malabou's
concepts further. I want to consider what happens to plasticity and
destructive plasticity when they are let loose in the wilds of politics.
As knowledge of our formable and forming nature becomes not just known
but made practical, the nightmare of humanists becomes real.
[**Populations of [human bodies]{.mark}** [without essential identities
**can be altered**]{.mark} or, [in the language of cybernetics]{.mark},
[steered]{.mark}.]{.underline} Unlike understandings of power, [even
[**subtle forms of disciplinary power**, **plasticity on the scale of
the individual**]{.mark} and the polis [represents]{.mark} the
possibility of **[change without subjection]{.mark}**]{.underline}, that
is, **[[without resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Rather than the
relations of power that make subjects in the Foucauldian image, [we have
the possibility of **designing or steering subjects** that have no index
of what they were before, such that something could resist. Instead,
plasticity represents the possibility of a frictionless change---[in the
sense that one can imagine]{.mark} (and has imagined) [the alteration of
the brain or the assemblage of
bodies-brains]{.mark}-[semiotics-technics]{.mark} that is often [called
the social]{.mark}---[that would leave no trace of what could be called
an alternative]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is not the failure of
resistance to produce an outcome, as in the case of the noncompliant
prisoner who nonetheless remains imprisoned. Instead, [plasticity raises
the question of techniques that produce bodies that do not know that the
"they" that they once were wanted to resist or even are
imprisoned.]{.underline} The incorporation of plasticity into politics
raises the specter of Gilles Deleuze's "societies of control," in which
[**individuals become "dividuals**"--- **humans as counters** in a
**flexible and constantly "modulating" economy**]{.underline}.32 Control
in this context is often read systemically, as if only the "society"
views humans as counters but the "dividuals" themselves, like Robert
Duvall's character in thx 1138, yearn to be free, to be unique.
[[Confronting]{.mark} plasticity and [its]{.mark} explosive [potential
to obliterate precursors poses a]{.mark} dif­ferent dividual, a [real
dividual]{.mark}: bodies [stripped not just of their identity
but]{.mark} of [the desire to have an identity]{.mark} or to have an
identity [nonidentical to the]{.mark} [identity that preceded it.
**Control** represents]{.mark} the **real possibility of
[order]{.mark}** [without the leverage]{.mark} or friction [of
ordering]{.mark}.]{.underline} Normatively I do not disagree with
Habermas and others that this reduction of freedom to an engineering
problem is horrifying. The point of disagreement is that arguing against
the existence of such a possibility will have an effect on the
probability of this nightmare.33 The attempt to safeguard humanity
through the scapegoating of materialist thinking is self-defeating, as
it insists that human freedom and dignity are independent of the brain
while also decrying the possibility of each "becoming material." In its
cruelest form, this line of argument amounts to trying to cure someone
with Alzheimer's by scolding her about the intrinsic dignity and
rationality of humans. Lesions beat argument every time. So rather than
taking recourse to moralize the horror of control[, [it is necessary to
take seriously]{.mark} the possibility of [control as a material
configuration enabled]{.mark} [by the inessential nature of
humans]{.mark}: their [plasticity]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, I
ask the reader to affirm the horror of destructive plasticity rather
than look away or flee into the arms of humanist sentimentality.

#### Here, the exploited participates in the same neoliberal logics of pragmatism, implicitly consenting to become sites of [knowledge extraction]{.underline}

A well-known slogan that emerged from the disability movement during the
1990s goes: "Nothing about us without us." It stresses that no policy
should be adopted without fully involving those who are affected by that
policy. Nowadays, it is a catchphrase used across different fields and
institutional settings, signaling that "[participation]{.underline}"
[has become a **placeholder** for **inclusion**]{.underline},
**[democracy]{.underline}**, [and **horizontal decision-making
processes**]{.underline}. Yet, [[what does]{.underline}
"[participation]{.underline}]{.mark}" in a given system [[mean
when]{.mark} the **[epistemic-political codes]{.mark}**]{.underline},
the ability to maneuver, and the stakes of the participation [[are **set
in advance**]{.mark} by the party in control]{.underline}? So-called
"participatory programs," like surveys and other forms of data
acquisition, have been used extensively by humanitarian agencies since
the 1990s, and more recently have shifted into systems for practicing
what I instead call "participatory confinement." In such systems,
[[individuals]{.mark} are **nudged** and [**encouraged** to]{.mark}
**actively [participate]{.mark}** [in their own confinement and
governmentality]{.mark}]{.underline}, "**[for their own
good]{.underline}**." Christopher Kelty, a scholar of science studies
and anthropology, rightly claims that [this]{.underline} sort of
"participation [is more often a **formatted procedure** by which
autonomous individuals attempt to reach **calculated
consensus**]{.underline}." [Not only are the [**goals** and
**forms**]{.mark} of participation often [**preestablished** and]{.mark}
**surreptitiously [imposed]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[but individuals
are]{.mark} also [**de facto** pushed to
**corroborate**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[contribute to]{.underline}**,
[and **improve** mechanisms of **confinement** and
**coercion**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here, I focus on refugee
humanitarianism as a case study for coming to grips with modes of
participatory confinement as a systematic political technology of
governmentality.

Modes of participatory confinement in refugee humanitarianism are
inflected by clear-cut asymmetric relations between asylum seekers on
one side, and humanitarian actors on the other. This initial condition
and its trend towards reform by way of inviting participation is
reminiscent of the diagnosis of prison reform by Michel Foucault in a
lecture he gave in 1976. Furnishing an anticipatory example of
participatory confinement, he writes: "[There is an attempt t[o **make
prisoners**]{.mark} **themselves [participate]{.mark}** in devising the
very programmes for their punishment]{.underline}, through the
prisoners' councils and so on. This is the idea that [the
individual]{.underline}, [**singly** or **collectively**]{.underline},
[is meant to **accept the punitive procedure**]{.underline}." Nowadays,
[participatory approaches]{.underline} are center stage on the agendas
of international agencies and NGOs in the context of the so-called
"refugee crisis" in Europe. They [[continue]{.mark} to operate [with the
**same neoliberal logics** of prior reforms]{.mark} to systems of
punishment and control [that **performatively invite**]{.mark} [the
exploited to **frame the forms** of that
exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [while]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[actually ceding no power]{.underline}** to the "participant."

Furthermore, invoking a term from Tiziana Terranova, participatory
confinement in refugee humanitarianism can also be considered a form of
"soft control." Asylum seekers are increasingly asked to answer
questionnaires and provide detailed information to humanitarian actors
about their coping strategies, migratory journeys, the logistics of
border crossing, and their protection needs. These activities are
presented to refugees as an opportunity to improve their individual
situation and, at the same time, the asylum system at large; in
actuality, they just increase the control that the system has over
refugees. In The Undercommons, Fred Moten and Stephano Harney refer to a
similar process as [[the]{.underline} "**[invitation to
governmentality]{.underline}**]{.mark}" [which subjects are **repeatedly
exposed** to]{.underline}. Elaborating on this notion, it can be argued
that this "invitation" in the context of humanitarian participatory
programs also [involves [pushing subjects to **perform unpaid labor** by
**providing feedback**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [They]{.underline}]{.mark}
[thus [**implicitly consent** to being sites for the **extraction of
knowledge**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is [used]{.underline} by NGOs
[to **further enforce** modes of control and governance]{.underline}.
Speaking of [an invitation to governmentality]{.underline} in these
terms also [sheds light on the multiple forms of **interpellation** that
individuals are subject to]{.underline}, [and how they are nudged to
participate]{.underline} "**[for their own good]{.underline}**." That
is, [[the invitation]{.mark} to governmentality that individuals are
exposed to in different contexts often [turns into]{.mark}]{.underline}
a form of **[[subtle coercion]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Control of Knowledge and Subjectivity

Ramose (2003) argues that [[the rationale that European colonialism
operated on was]{.underline}]{.mark} an unsubstantiated [belief [that
Africans]{.mark}, among other non-European races, [were not rational
beings]{.mark}]{.underline} hence, they were [[not entitled
to]{.underline}]{.mark} what rational beings claimed as their
[entitlement and [rights]{.mark}]{.underline}. He argues that: One of
the bases of colonisation was that **[[the belief 'man is a rational
animal' was not spoken of the African]{.mark}, the [Amerindian]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} the [Australasian]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Aristotle's
definition of man was deeply inscribed in the social ethos of those
communities and societies that undertook the so-called voyages of
discovery---apparently driven by innocent curiosity. But it is well
known that these voyages changed into violent colonial incursions. It
seems then that the entire process of decolonisation has, among others,
upheld and not jettisoned the questionable belief that 'man is a
rational animal' excludes the African, the Amerindian, and the
Australasian. (Ramose 2003: 1) What Ramose manages to reveal is that
[[the]{.underline} **[imaginary right and exclusive claim]{.underline}**
[to rationality]{.underline}]{.mark} by Europe(ans) [[is]{.mark} only
[realised because of]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[material
power]{.underline}]{.mark}** [fashioned [to **guard and preserve the
myth that Africa is unable to rationally construct
knowledge**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The power of the gun is what Europe
used to scatter its patterns, templates, designs and standards across
the globe. [Power]{.underline} in European terms [is tantamount to
instruments of control emitted by violence.]{.underline} [[This
imaginary]{.mark} exclusive [right to rationality]{.mark}]{.underline}
by Europe(ans) has [wide-ranging and extensive implications for
knowledge production about Africa by Africans.]{.underline} This
[[is]{.underline} [meant]{.underline} [to cast doubt and reinforce the
modern bias]{.underline}]{.mark} [on Africa and other non-European
races;]{.underline} it is also meant [to make the non-European doubt
themselves as to their capacity to rationalise, think and
philosophise]{.underline}. [[**European** imagination]{.mark}, and
[hence **modernity**, "is doubtful \[that\] Africans are wholly and
truly human beings"]{.mark} and it questions the Africans' capacity to
philosophise]{.underline} (Ramose 2003: 5). The pattern that European
imagination implanted in the mind of the African is to doubt herself and
himself. This pattern is relatable to what Mudimbe (1987: 2) called the
"organising structure" and what wa Thiongó (1981: 94) called the
"organising principle". This chapter adds the 'ordering structure' to
the long-standing patterns of control that European civilisation
subjected Africa to. [The self-doubting African cannot and is not meant
to know or produce knowledge about \[theirself\]]{.underline} ~~herself
and himself~~, [let alone \[their\]]{.underline} ~~her/his~~
[surroundings and localities]{.underline}.
[[Europeans]{.underline}]{.mark}, as are self-acclaimed exclusive
recipients of rationality, have thus [[put themselves on a]{.underline}
**[pedestal of knowledge production]{.underline}**, [and at
the]{.underline} **[apex of]{.underline}**]{.mark} correct and therefore
**[[truthful knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [There is
[an]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[underlying attitude]{.underline}** [that
exudes itself as though Europeans]{.underline}]{.mark} [were the only
race and civilisation that [hold]{.mark}s [and embodies]{.mark} [the
truth]{.mark}]{.underline}. [As a result, an African's right to
knowledge is contingent upon a "passive as well as uncritical
assimilation" of the knowledge produced in Europe for
Europeans]{.underline} and the whole world (Ramose 2003: 2). [Africans
are then supposed to faithfully implement the knowledge that is
constructed, defined and designed "outside Africa"]{.underline} (ibid.).
**[[Coloniality of knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}** [therefore [refers
to the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[Euro-North American intellectual
thought]{.underline}** [as the referral point upon which]{.underline}
**[all other epistemologies]{.underline}**]{.mark} and knowledges [are
judged]{.underline} against. [As an epistemological
movement]{.underline}, "[[it has always been]{.underline}
**[overshadowed by hegemonic Euro-north American-centric intellectual
thought]{.underline}** [and social theories]{.underline}]{.mark}"
(Ramose 2003: 2). [Knowledge production, and the capacity to think and
generate is a preserve of Euro-North American-centric modernity
resulting in the creation of "border thinking"]{.underline} (Arturo
Escobar in Mignolo 2001: 179). The thinking is [located in the
Euro-North American civilisation, beyond that geography, there exist no
rationality. Such is the thinking of Euro-North American-centric
civilisation]{.underline}.

#### Here, epistemology and technology [converge]{.underline} to create the [war assemblage]{.underline}, an economy of [mundane war]{.underline}, a slow, unending violence

[[War]{.mark} as [defined by classical]{.mark} war [studies
suggests]{.mark} a **[distinct]{.mark} class of [actors, interests,
aims, and expertise]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As a result, [the study of
war as well as much of the social mobilization of war **presumes an
exteriority of war** and warfare from other sectors and institutions
like the economy or the state]{.underline}. For those who study military
history, war---in [this limited understanding]{.underline}---[can
certainly be decisive in the rise and fall of nation-states and even
transformations of the global system when that system is only indexed by
the states that populate it, but the pursuit of these histories still
presumes a kind of exceptional character of war. [War following
this]{.mark} line of thought [is a **cataclysmic event** that
interrupts]{.mark} the **otherwise [normal]{.mark} character of daily
[life]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For others, particularly in the field of
strategic studies, warfare is a tool, an instrument whereby states and
sometimes organizations pursue ends beyond the limits of politics and
persuasion. [War compels and determines a course of action as an
orchestral direction of overwhelming force]{.underline}. For those who
hope to abolish war, a parallel exteriority animates their theorizing
about war. War, according to these thinkers, is reducible to the
self-interest of hegemonic states, the militarism of soldiers, and the
self-amplifying loop of profit and power. Presidents, generals, ceos,
arms dealers, and patriots come together to pursue war as an end in
itself. Again, those actors and those pursuits are treated as outside
the normal realm of human social relations. But what if war is history?
What if the very form of life that created, was reinforced by, mutated
with, and emerged from the Eurocene is warlike? [State-making,
territorialization, expansion, annihilation, settlement, and
globalization are all warlike relations]{.underline}. I want to
[consider the possibility of war and warlike relations as processes of
making a form of life in which warfare is normal]{.underline}. And what
I mean by normal is much more than what we mean when we use concepts
like ideology or legitimacy or discipline. By normal, I mean [[the
**very fabric of relations**]{.mark} that [**makes a form of life and a
world:** **a war body**, **a war assemblage**, **a war
ecology**]{.mark}. I am not suggesting that war is the only form of
life. [There are surviving forms of life interior and exterior to the
Eurocene]{.mark}]{.underline}. No process of annihilation succeeds
without leaving at least a trace.3 However, [[the normal workings
of]{.mark} [daily global life are a state of war]{.mark}. Rather than
think of state of war in the juridical or theoretical sense, which
distinguish war from peace on the grounds of declarations or measures of
order, I want to [consider **war as an ecology** **endemic to the
Eurocene**]{.mark}.]{.underline} So by state of war I mean state in the
sense that physicists or chemists think about states of matter. Every
state of matter is an order, and despite that order, every state of
matter has some elements of other states. A state of matter exhibits
properties like solidity, liquidity, gaseousness, or the full-on
freak-out of plasma but is not entirely made up of that state. And yet
the state still has an effect despite that heterogeneity. So to say that
we live in a global state of war, and that the making of the [Eurocene
was that making of a global state of war, is to say that war intensifies
the field of relations that make the world what it is right now, not
that [it exhausts the possibility of what the world can
become]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, [the [practices]{.mark} and
organizations---[from]{.mark} [resource extraction, enclosure, carbon
liberation, racialization, mass incarceration, border enforcement,
policing and security practices]{.mark}, primitive [accumulation by
dispossession, targeted strikes]{.mark}, [to]{.mark} allout
[combat]{.mark}---[are]{.mark} relations of [war rather than]{.mark}
merely correlates or opportunities for a war metaphor.]{.underline} To
put it a bit more bluntly, [politics, colonialism, settlement,
capitalism, ecological destruction, racism, and misogynies are not wars
by other means---they are war]{.underline}. [**War is not a metaphor**;
it is an **intensive fabric of relations making the
Eurocene.**]{.underline} To make this claim requires
rethinking---somewhat bombastically---the meaning of war. If war has
such a wide application, it would seem to mean nothing. In talks,
roundtables, and casual conversations, [colleagues have often suggested
that such an expansive definition of war is polemical or even
absurd]{.underline}. Others have said that spreading war so thin
cheapens the sacrifices and tragedies of those who have experienced
"real war." It is curious to me that many of [the same people have no
difficulty assigning similar base or structuring characteristics to
capitalism, settlement, or patriarchy]{.underline}. I do not see war as
a replacement or a displacement of those structuring structures.
Instead, [war is like those other complicated, heterogeneous, abstract
machines but interrelated and importantly semiautonomous in the making
of the world. The importance of shifting the point of emphasis or break
between war and other "big processes" is to emphasize [the way
**collectively making death** comes to be **its**]{.mark} **[own]{.mark}
[organizing ecology]{.mark}** [**rather than just an instrumental means
for other ecologies**]{.mark}, such as racism or sexism or
capitalism]{.underline}, that are often more obviously invested in
ordering---subordinating orders---than destruction. Furthermore, [I do
not think, given the extreme level of violence and deprivation necessary
to create the global ecology we now inhabit, that it is "a stretch" to
call war the **constitutive fabric of planetary
relations**.]{.underline} Instead, [war as an intensive difference takes
possession of other categories, at which point phase shifts take place
in categories like racism or economics]{.underline}. [What was the slow,
lethal burn of postslavery policing escalates into the fury of outright
combat in the streets, a race war in the streets of 1921 Tulsa or the
2015 streets of Baltimore. Even in our sacred texts of democratic
theory, the **pulsing tributaries of war** **run throughout**
descriptions of **political formation**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} John
Locke argued with little dispute that slavery was the
institutionalization of war.4 And W. E. B. Du Bois said of the process
of reconstruction after slavery that war had begun again, and in fact
had never ended.5 Do we think that the same could not be said for the
vast carceral project directed at black people described so well by
Michelle Alexander or Loïc Wacquant?6 The common retort is to ask
whether this line of thinking means all forms of killing should be
considered war. I think that is a reasonable question. However, I
believe that retort actually demonstrates the problem of war in the
Eurocene. Take, for instance, the lynching of African Americans after
the American Civil War or the routine murder of Native Americans by
settlers before the arrival of the American cavalry during the period of
westward expansion. Were these killings disparate acts of murder or
strategically valuable microevents of war? How would patriarchy's
sadistic continuity and heterogeneous creativity across geography and
time survive without the nearly viral practices of domestic violence
that suture norms to bruises, scars, and corpses? [[To]{.mark} [exclude
the way **each micropractice of
war**]{.mark}---murder---**[aggregates]{.mark} over time and space**
[into **continental** ]{.mark}**scale, [slow-mo]{.mark}tion
[warfare]{.mark}** [would]{.mark} significantly [impoverish our
understanding of the role war plays]{.mark} in the making of global
systems.]{.underline} Any one act of brutality could be dismissed on
idiosyncratic grounds and attributed to lazy claims about human nature.
Or these [acts of brutality can be brought into a conceptual
jurisdiction of war such that we can get a glimpse of how these
seemingly disparate practices of violence resonate, congeal, and order
the global system.]{.underline} The historical granularity necessary to
prove this seemingly absurd proposition is well beyond the scope of this
book. Instead, this chapter and the larger aim of the book try to
identify operators or machines in the emergence of war that confound the
tried and true questions of sovereignty, security dilemmas, and the
increasingly apparent absurdity of circumscribing global political
change to the behavior of "great powers" in a rationalist and
statecentric sense. The commitment to a world run by the causal agents
of states, regimes, and norms (whether thick or thin) appears to me like
the Velveteen Rabbit: toys whose straw stuffing is beginning to poke
through worn skin and whose button eyes have been long since lost.
Unlike the mythic rabbit, there is nothing real for these fetishes to
become.7 The first step to understand war as a form of life that is
world forming requires building a community of concepts capable of
capturing the diversity of relations at work in the making of war. It is
a messy inquiry. In recoil from this indiscernible mess, there are those
who would rather "un--black box" phenomena by exhaustively identifying
all actants or detailing complex processes of social and material
change, but these approaches are ill-suited to describing the broader
ecology of war. [The problem with the desire to explain or un--black box
phenomena is that it seduces us to focus on those phenomena on which we
think we have the best chance of imposing an artificial autonomy or
separation of things and events]{.underline}. Those phenomena that seem
to give themselves up to analyzable bits and pieces are prized for
publication and research funding. This cult of discreteness has not
gotten us very far. Reality does not, as some realist philosophers say
in a creepy analogy to butchering, "cut at the joints."8 Positivism,
even the complexity and systems variety, wants an object of inquiry at
an instant. In a particularly Whiteheadian moment, Merleau-Ponty
responds to the desire for discreteness with disdain: In human
existence, then, there is a principle of indetermination, and this
indetermination does not merely exist for us . . . from some
imperfection in our knowledge. . . . Existence is indeterminate in
itself because of its fundamental structure: insofar as existence is the
very operation by which something that had no sense takes on sense. . .
. Existence has no fortuitous attributes and no content that does not
contribute to giving it its form, it does not admit any pure facts in
themselves, because it is the movement by which facts are taken up.9 [In
the attempt to vivisect existence]{.underline}---[[to reduce to an
instant what is process]{.mark} and movement, rhythm and
relation]{.underline}---[those more subtle connections or resonances
whose effects are felt but not discrete are overshadowed by those
relationships we can chart and measure]{.underline}. Such an approach
circumscribes our thinking rather than allowing it to remain open to the
emergence of thought as provoked by a wild world. Domesticated notions
of complexity are stand-ins for the merely complicated. Real complexity
suggests that there is novelty in the world rather than thinking that
novelty is an effect of a complicated process. This is what
Merleau-Ponty means when he says that the indeterminate is the
"fundamental structure of the world." Those who see in complexity the
mere character of complicatedness invest in that image of complexity the
hope for more sophisticated predictive models and desire a mechanistic
universe defined by initial conditions.10 For [those striving to create
positivism 2.0]{.underline}, [chance exists as an endangered species to
be extinguished once all the data are in.]{.underline} I think [this
[diminishes the **creative and chaotic elements** of
**becoming**]{.mark} characteristic of [**ecologies like war**, and
**reinvests the desire** for **order and control** with a **false and
dangerous telos**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The aleatory is
reduced to a question of epistemology rather than being seen as a
**generative principle of the cosmos**, giving new confidence to those
who would **see to make useful predictions** or pronouncements **upon
their models of the world.**]{.underline} I admit it is tempting when
new scientific discoveries verify our own theoretical belief in thinking
that somehow science has finally gotten it right. However, one need only
look at what happens when the image of thought founded on this new
faux-empiricism combines with the shabby categories of interest and
security to see how quickly scientific facts about complexity or quantum
physics or networks or sociobiology can be put to use for preventive war
and social control.11 [In international relations, even insights about
uncertainty can become a predictive social scientific
method]{.underline}.12 [The postcolonies and pockets of peoples
surviving settlement are still finding that the "study" of their
cultures' complexities serves the interests of those who would
obliterate difference rather than those who would insist on a new
pluralism]{.underline}. [Anthropologists, sociologists, and
economists---all armed with the latest in social-actor-network theory,
complexity equations, and advanced social media scraping
algorithms---are deployed as part of the subsequent revisions of the
Human Terrain System in Iraq, Afghanistan, Chicago, Los Angeles, the
Dakota Access Pipeline, Yemen, Mexico, Mali, and back
again]{.underline}. **[[Knowledge separated from its ethical
considerations is readily weaponized]{.underline}]{.mark}**.13 Rapidly
scoping from the micro of culture to the macro of the planetary scale,
[the Eurocene is already transitioning from territorial warfare to
geopolitically motivated geoengineering and regional terraforming to
institutionalize hegemony geologically while still refining the
microscopic collection of data on threats as small as a single
person.]{.underline}14 Inspired by the work in early chaos and
catastrophe theory, Deleuze and Guattari suggest another path for the
pursuit of complexity. Rather than ignore the overwhelming complexity of
the world, [scientific inquiry can be a way to cope with chaos "defined
not so much by its disorder as by the infinite speed with which every
form taking shape in it vanishes]{.underline}."15 Creative sciences
attack the problem of chaos by attributing functions to chaos so that
its shifting patterns, orders, and relations can be thought. Functions
are a kind of "fantastic slowing down, and it is by slowing down that
matter, as well as the scientific thought able to penetrate it with
propositions, is actualized."16 I want to develop war as something
between a function and a concept. I am trying to draw together
consistencies by extending out, "building bridges," and occupying larger
zones of components and functions that attempt to slow down,
distinguish, and make actual indexible territories of interest, which
only appear whole because investigation as a science has imposed a kind
of temporary and hesitant "freeze frame."17 One could become worried
that such provisional moments could get mistaken for reality itself,
however, with close attention, care for the world, such mistakes are
hard to maintain. The relational (in movement-process) and substantive
character of the world defies reductionism. Novelist and philosophical
tinkerer Tristan Garcia explains the neither/nor of concept
object-relations as follows: A thing is nothing other than the
difference between that which is in this thing and that in which this
thing is. Unless one guarantees this double sense, there are no
thinkable things. Every reductionist who claims to deduce that which
this or that thing is from that which composes this or that thing only
succeeds in dis-solving the very thing that they claim to account for.
We attempt to accomplish the exact opposite of this: to guarantee things
as invaluable differences embedded in the distribution channels of being
of the world. To complete our task, we set out to discover the meaning
which circulates among things, between that which composes them and that
which they compose, inside or outside us, with or without us.18
[War]{.underline} in particular [demands this double aspect of things to
capture war's territorializing and deterritorializing tendencies to make
and unmake things and be a thing all at the same time.]{.underline}
Although throughout the [book I take inspiration from new scientific
researc]{.underline}h---examples from [[neuroscience, physics,
evolutionary **biology**, **artificial intelligence**]{.mark}, and
experimental [psychiatry]{.mark}]{.underline}---that inspiration will
not be used to build some new, more stable, method of inquiry, but
instead I will try [to [trouble a]{.mark} still [pervasive image of the
world as law-governed]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore, [[war]{.mark}
serves a double movement: it [presents itself as an ordering
principle]{.mark} or form of ecology [despite]{.mark} the frequent
[conflation between war and chaos, while]{.mark} also
[undermining]{.mark} the image of [the world as one ruled by the laws of
a singular transcendental order]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even many
postpositivists, particularly interpretivists, of various kinds are
unsettled by this kind of open-ended or experimental thought, absurdly
big claims, oriented around assemblages, resonances, or systems of
thought particularly in the context of war and violence because it means
letting go, at least for a moment, of the desire to ascribe blame or
culpability---from my perspective, consonant with causality---to
particular individuals in time and space. This is a deficit, but it
comes with the benefit of elucidating, even if only vaguely, the
operators in the generation of technics, affects, peoples, and weak or
novel connections in the savage ecologies that often determine, or at
least circumscribe, the incipient possibilities of action by the
individuals we so desperately want to hold accountable for their
failures or vices. Remember Walt Whitman's words that began this book,
"The war---that war so bloody and grim---the war I will henceforth
forget---was you and me." The question in the context of this research
is: Why is [there so consistently an arrangement of racial supremacy,
power, ethics, and violence to prosecute or distribute war and
technical-martial logic to support and distribute it?]{.underline} While
it is valuable to investigate how leaders can function to amplify
conflict, [what is striking is how quickly any one leader can be
replaced and how little the trajectory of war changes. Following
Sloterdijk's pronouncement on [the **becoming atmospheric of
contemporary warfare**]{.mark}**,** collective violence [is **saturating
every corner of the Earth system**]{.mark}, but like carbon, neither the
distributors nor distribution of violence is equitable]{.underline}.
Saturation is no excuse for universality. There will never be a we that
is human as such. And yet there is also no tribe, history of proper
names, or nation-state that can bear the responsibility in any
meaningful way. Twenty or thirty generations of malicious and sadistic
decisions cannot amount to the collective effect of the heterogeneous
relations that produced the Eurocene but neither should we let go of the
particular forms of life that congealed around an instrumental approach
to collective violence that swallowed and then organized peoples,
nonhuman peoples, and things throughout Europe and then the regions
those people, nonhuman peoples, and things settled. Mapping something
like the totality of those actors and relations is impossible and maybe
even counterproductive, but tracing the lineages of warfare that came to
enable the expansion of the Europeans until they became a "cene," a
geologically and geopolitically significant order, may gather up a swarm
of conceptual machines still buzzing through our contemporary moment.
Consequently, I am less interested in why once such an institution or
assemblage is in place, a leader at a given moment succeeds in making
actual the already present virtual tendencies of war. Consider how
difficult it is to reconcile our lost hope for Barack Obama with the
expected failure of George W. Bush or how quickly the terror over Donald
Trump was normalized once the adults from the military stepped in,
precisely because [foreign policies of each arrangement of leadership
are in many ways indistinguishable, particularly from the perspectives
of their victims.]{.underline}19 It is not surprising to me, then, that
sovereigns make war, or that they take advantage of democratic paradoxes
to do so. [The problematic that drives this section is how such a
complex, mobile, and global ecology of war so closely aligns and adheres
to such a seemingly local decision as a sovereign act of violence or
declaration of war.]{.underline} One might take a lesson from the
electrification of sound. In order to amplify or magnify a sound and
preserve the fidelity of a particular harmonic arrangement, one cannot
simply "turn up" the volume. It requires a certain interface between the
means of amplification, the ambient qualities of the room, the number of
people present, and the resonant capabilities of those people, the
furniture, the walls, the floor, and the ceiling. Similarly, political
decrees or decisions to produce effects must reverberate and interface
with complex assemblages of institutions, economies, ethical
dispositions, affective discourses, and other machinic operators. From
this perspective, [[sovereign "decisions]{.mark}," whether by presidents
or suicide bombers, [appear]{.mark} [to be on both sides of the razor's
edge between cause and effect]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such an approach
requires, as Deleuze writes, "not so much . . . convincing, as being
open about things. Being open is setting out the 'facts' not only of a
situation, but of a problem. Making visible things that would otherwise
remain hidden."20 So [we have a world full of sovereign violence, but
the place of a given sovereign in the distribution of that violence
remains obscure. What follows is an attempt to flush out the
contemporary milieu or ecology of war in its mutational, material, and
global tendencies to open up the landscape for something that requires a
history]{.underline}. In the following chapter, I return to the specific
historical mutations of war that contributed war's contemporary becoming
as a Euro-cum-American facialization of the Eurocene. The sections that
follow look for these "loose associations" or dif­ferent assemblages that
may not yet have converged or connected but have tendencies and internal
resonances that I think organize war's various becomings. In particular,
[[I consider the **ecology of annihilation** that **characterizes
American practices of warfare** now **dominant among "great
powers**]{.underline}."]{.mark} These parts do not follow one from the
other. They are often disjointed in their locations and themes. The hope
is that the consistency that does connect them is one of possibility or
chance rather than necessity so that the sense of inevitability that
often characterizes the analysis of global security is not so easily
territorialized for the capture of war. Some connections will appear
more obvious than others, but, like other kinds of ecologies, sometimes
the connections are merely the happenstance of coinciding; contingency
can produce novelty and novelty can be catastrophic and horrifying. From
this perspective, I ask what it would mean to consider the driving force
of the Eurocene, war, ecologically.

#### This expansion of war beyond physicality enables [dark pure war]{.underline}, inseparable from capitalism, colonialism, and militarization

**Towns, 19**---associate professor in Communication and Media Studies,
Carleton University (Armond, "(Dark) Pure War: Virilio, the Cinematic,
and the Racial," Media Theory, Vol. 3, No. 2, 145-160, dml//-ekh-)

In Pure War, Paul Virilio argued that [[war continued **beyond**]{.mark}
the [physicality]{.mark} of the battlefield]{.underline}. [Outside of
the violence of the **fight** lay a violence of **[industrial]{.mark}
[production]{.mark}** [toward the **conditions** for
war]{.mark}]{.underline}. Put differently, [**[pure w]{.mark}ar**
signified the new ways that war was now [acted out]{.mark}]{.underline}
['[in **infinite preparation**]{.underline}']{.mark} (Virilio, 2008:
29). Pure war indicated the always already active preparation for war by
the state, even when war was not being physically waged.

One could say that a cornerstone of Virilio's research has been media's
relation to unending war. [[A **central component**]{.mark} of pure
war]{.underline}, for example, [[is
**info**]{.mark}**rmation**]{.underline}, or [the **[gathering]{.mark}
of [data]{.mark}** [to surveil and police populations]{.mark} that are
always [under the]{.mark} watchful [eye of the war
machine]{.mark}]{.underline}. Interestingly, Virilio concerns himself
less with the racial implications of those who are open to surveilling
and policing and more with the expansion of policing and surveilling as
practices that are applicable to 'everyone'. Yet, his examples of war
have racial undertones that he often does not fully investigate: the
Vietnam War, the Iraq War, and the Italo-Ethiopian War, to name a few,
all creep toward the pure war. Even as Virilio (2002) acknowledged the
racial implications of the Second World War, he had less to say about
the recognition that the Nazis pulled their racialized strategies of
death for the European Jewish population from the US state's approach to
black and indigenous people (Whitman, 2017). Each of these wars, between
white and nonwhite people or between white and white people in relation
to those who could never fully be white, suggest that the wars that
Virilio found most interesting were not race neutral.

What can Virilio provide for a media studies of race? I argue that
Virilio's work on [[pure war can be]{.mark} [reinterpreted
as]{.mark}]{.underline} a '**[[dark]{.underline}]{.mark}** pure war',
[[concerned with a **militaristic**]{.underline}, **[unending
war]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[against nonwhite
populations]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is a dark pure war, one that
structures the colony and the metropole, that lays the foundation for
pure war. [**Dark pure war** is]{.underline} not necessarily 'black' in
the racialized sense, even as it often functions that way. Instead, it
is black in the '**[blackening]{.underline}**' sense, [in]{.underline}
what Kumi Silva (2010) calls [the]{.underline}
'[identification]{.underline}' [of nonwhite bodies as open to state
violence]{.underline}. Thus, pulling from Virilio and Simone Browne's
(2015) Dark Matters, a [dark pure war outlines the **centrality** of
race to the continuance of war]{.underline}, even as race is the
purposefully forgotten genesis of such war. [This is
**not**]{.underline} Michel Foucault's (2003) '**[race
war]{.underline}**', as Europe is not the central locale from which such
war occurs. Rather, [dark pure war is [**inseparable** from
**Euro-American imperial**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[capitalistic
expansionism]{.underline}** ([**colonialism** and **racial
slavery**]{.underline}) [as **militarized projects**
toward]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[maintenance of white life]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} the **[conditions of black death]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
**[ad infinitum]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

Virilio's work has been called, rightly in my opinion, 'wild and
aphoristic' (Sharma, 2013). Yet, I want to say that what Virilio may
point toward is an investigation of the centrality of technologies to
racialization processes. Surveillance studies (which has long
investigated race) and media philosophy (which has been slower to
discuss race) are put into conversation with one another here. I advance
the concept of dark pure war in three sections. I start by delineating
the connections between war, cinema, and information that Virilio argued
were important. I then move into outlining the darkness of pure war,
particularly by outlining the racialized components of contemporary
policing and surveillance. I conclude by calling for a rethinking of
'dromology', one that moves toward including the multi-symbolic capacity
of 'race' in discussions of war.

The Perceptions of War: Vision and the Cinematic

In War and Cinema, Virilio argued that the history of war was both
theatrical and a history of transforming perceptual fields, whereby
vision was increasingly the site of power. As such, the rifle's
gunsights and the camera came together to situate the world as a field
of vision that could be measured, calculated, and shot. For Virilio,
film functioned as a pedagogical tool, one that involved an increasing
sensorial detachment from film itself. Virilio's example is the famous
myth of an audience in Paris watching a film of a moving locomotive
filling the screen causing the people in the cinema to believe the train
was going to drive over them:

\[In\] fact it was the precision of the camera-shot which first created
audience panic at the Lumières' 'motion demonstrations' of the train's
arrival at la Ciotat, when everyone felt that they risked being crushed
or injured by the train. This kind of fear, akin to the sense of speed
that people seek on roller coasters, did not disappear but simply became
more pernicious as the audience learnt to control its nervous reactions
and began to find death amusing (Virilio, 1989: 39-40).

What Virilio pointed to was a transformation in perception: film
produced images of objects, thus, perceptually distancing audiences from
said objects, to a point where there would no longer be a need to panic
at the sight of an oncoming train in a cinema. There have been a few
attempts to debunk the myth of whether or not the audience was actually
sent running at the sight of the train (Cooper, 2016; Grundhauser,
2016), but the fact still stands: 'film is now second nature to us, but
it was utterly shocking not much more than a century ago' (Cooper,
2016).

Cinemas were 'training camps', bonding 'people together in the face of
death agony, teaching them to master the fear of what they did not know
-- or rather, as Hitchcock put it, of what did not exist' (Virilio,
1989: 40). In short, cinema readied people for 'the artificial horizon
of a screen or a monitor capable of permanently displaying the
preponderance of the media perspective, the relief of the "tele-present"
event taking precedence over the three dimensions of the volume of the
objects or places here present' (Virilio, 2006: 66). This training did
not occur overnight, but involved multiple media forms that all worked
toward perceptual transformation. As such, more than cinema, Virilio is
interested in the 'cinematic', which included and exceeded cinema,
proper; he tried to track the link between cinema, war, and later
'vision machines', such as television, CCTV, smart devices, and drone
strikes, assuring us that 'Components of a cinematic machine have been
in use over many centuries: forms of projection, moving images, immobile
voyages, and visionary illuminations' (Crary, 2009: 13). The cinema,
television, and war all worked together toward distancing audiences from
objects, for Virilio.

Virilio's work on cinema also adds much to those interested in studying
the Web and information. [In the wake of the **atom bomb**]{.underline},
[Virilio warned of]{.underline} a second bomb, [the]{.underline}
'**[information bomb]{.underline}**', which is important for pure war.
[Whereas the atom bomb was a war of **movement**]{.underline}, [the
information bomb was a war of **knowledge** and **speed**]{.underline},
signifying a war 'won' by the increasing speed of interactivity in real
time. Such a bomb included and exceeded cinema, and essentially
structured computer screens and the Web -- both media developed during
and after the Second World War, and very much because of it. This is a
trajectory of transformations that cannot be said to have origins in
cinema, but were representative of the impact of the cinematic:

We're still here in the domain of cinematic illusion, of the mirage of
information precipitated on the computer screen what is given is exactly
the information but not the sensation; it is the apatheia, this
scientific impassibility which makes it so that the more informed man is
the more the desert of the world expands around him, the more the
repetition of information (already known) upsets the stimuli of
observation, overtaking them automatically, not only in memory (interior
light) but first of all in the look, to the point that from now on it's
the speed of light itself which limits the reading of information and
the important thing in electronic information is no longer the storage
but the display (Virilio, 2009: 56).

For Virilio, then, the shift from 'tele-vision' to 'tele-surveillance'
reflected the demands of capitalism and war. Whereas tele-vision held
'the task of informing or entertaining the mass of viewers' (Virilio,
2006: 59), the new tele-vision, or the 'tele-surveillance', was
concerned with 'exposing and invading of individuals' domestic space,
like a new form of lighting, which is capable of revolutionizing the
notion of neighborhood unit, or of a building or district' (Virilio,
2006: 59). The drone strike, then, could pinpoint a 'target's' location,
whether indoors or outdoors.

Thus, tele-surveillance spoke to a 'dromology,' a 'speed politics', or a
politics of instantaneousness, sparked by [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
increasing [[need to **entertain**]{.underline},
**[monitor]{.underline}**, [and **prepare** others]{.underline}]{.mark}
[for their own monitoring]{.underline}. Further, [it
**[replicated]{.mark}** the waging of **[war]{.mark}** on people [at a
distance]{.mark}]{.underline}: 'Making information resonate globally,
which is necessary [in]{.underline} the age of [[the **great planetary
market**]{.underline}]{.mark}, is in many ways going to resemble the
practices and uses of military intelligence, and also political
propaganda and its excesses' (Virilio, 2006: 62). Likewise,
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} spoke to what many have called a
'**[[slow]{.mark} [violence]{.mark}]{.underline}**[']{.mark}, one that
[[**disproportionately impacts** the **Global
South**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Nixon, 2011; Parikka, 2017), as a space
largely viewed solely [as [a **waste station** of the Global
North]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[War]{.mark} is a **continual
process** that **[does not end when the last round is
fired]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [but]{.underline}]{.mark} [is also
[carried out via the **circulation of information** and
**propaganda**]{.mark} in ways that **penetrate**]{.underline}
architecture **[without]{.underline}** necessarily physically
**[destroying]{.underline}** a building's structural integrity.

Dark Pure War: Surveillance and the Racial

[Pure war is the continuance of war **after** the physicality of war is
over and done]{.underline}; now, [information functions toward the
continuance of war]{.underline}, [as a **preemptive strike** against
enemies]{.underline}: 'But **[war doesn't really end]{.underline}**, as
Virilio noted, **[it just accelerates]{.underline}**, approximating ever
more closely to its pure form' (Wark, 2018). [Information is now a
**central component** of war]{.underline}, whereby '[Not only is
architecture **vulnerable** to bombs]{.underline}, [it proves
**defenseless** against information]{.underline}, [passing
through]{.underline} the doors and walls of [our homes]{.underline},
[**rearranging** the space and time we imagine we live
within]{.underline}' (Wark, 2018). Indeed, 'the capability of war
without war manifests a parallel information market of propaganda,
illusion, dissimulation' (Der Derian, 2002: viii).

To rethink Virilio's pure war as dark pure war requires thinking about
not only how [information is **weaponized** toward war's
continuance]{.underline}, but also the presumed racial neutrality
associated with both war and information. Thus, [[race is the
**underexamined**]{.underline}, [**overlooked**
element]{.underline}]{.mark} of Virilio's theory. Like discussions of
dark matter in physics, Browne's employment of '[**[dark
matter]{.underline}**']{.mark} is meant to [[point toward
the]{.underline}]{.mark} 'unseen and [**[unperceived]{.underline}**'
[elements of antiblackness in]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[surveillant
practices]{.underline}]{.mark}** of contemporary society. She argues
that '[**rather** than seeing surveillance as something inaugurated by
**new technologies**]{.underline}, such as automated facial recognition
or unmanned autonomous vehicles (or drones)' (Browne, 2015: 8), [[we can
instead]{.mark} [think about]{.mark}]{.underline} ['[surveillance in and
of black life as a **fact of blackness**]{.underline}']{.mark} (Browne,
2015: 6). Thus, Browne connects surveillance theory to a dark history
concerned with the measurement of bodies to see their 'intentions', a
dark history often underexamined in surveillance studies. That history
is scientific racism:

Anthropometry, or Bertillonage, was introduced in 1883 by Alphonse
Bertillon as a system of measuring and then cataloguing the human body
by distinguishing one individual from another for the purposes of
identification, classification, and criminal forensics. This early
biometric information technology was put to work as a "scientific
method," alongside the pseudo-sciences of craniometry (the measurement
of the skull to assign criminality and intelligence to race and gender)
and phrenology (attributing mental abilities to the shape of the skull,
as the skull was believed to hold a brain made up of individual organs)
(Browne, 2015: 112).

What Browne points toward is a question unasked by Virilio: what if
[[the]{.underline} '[fact of blackness]{.underline}' [is the
**structuring necessity** for]{.underline}]{.mark} [the new
[technologies of surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline} themselves? This
would require that we rethink pure war as a dark pure war, which is to
say that [[pure war holds race as **central**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[while [**never acknowledging** its importance to the **maintenance of
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

What if we thought about Virilio's pure war as a racial condition in the
US? In short, what if we were to rearticulate WEB Du Bois' (1994)
question of, 'How does it feel to be a problem', as a racialized
question of war? The end of the US Civil War and [[the end
of]{.underline}]{.mark} racial [[slavery marked]{.mark} the structure of
[pure war as a **condition**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[rather than a
**contingency**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [of black life]{.underline}.
Another way to say this is that white people went to war with each other
over the right to own our black bodies in the US Civil War, and it
presumably ended in 1865. Yet, the replication of racial violence, what
Saidiya Hartman (2008) calls [[the]{.underline} '**[afterlife of
slavery]{.underline}**', [has **yet to end**]{.underline}]{.mark} [for
black people]{.underline}; instead, [[racial violence is
**fundamental**]{.mark} to what it means to be black]{.underline} ([and
white]{.underline}) in the US. [[Jim Crowism]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[ghettoization]{.underline}, [deindustrialization]{.underline}, [white
flight]{.underline}, [mass incarceration]{.underline}, [and
gentrification are **remnants** of dark pure war]{.underline}]{.mark}.
They are post-war answers to how to deal with a 'problem'; to call for
their end is to call for the end to what many cannot let go of:
whiteness. Further, with race at its center, this entails that [black
people are not the only ones affected by dark pure war]{.underline},
[but are part of dark pure war's larger assemblage]{.underline}.

What Virilio pointed toward, then, was that cinema and war were
necessarily interconnected and assistants in the perceptual
transformations that readied populations for their own continual
surveillance; and just as important, [such forms of
[surveillance]{.mark} have been [tested on people of color **prior** to
their implementation on the **larger society**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This is what Browne refers to as [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} 'unseen and
[[unperceived]{.underline}' [component]{.underline}]{.mark}
[of]{.underline} dark matter and what I call [dark pure
war]{.underline}: it [[is the **necessity** of the black body as an
**always already surveillable**]{.underline}, **[commodified
object]{.underline}**,]{.mark} one that can normalize even the
contemporary surveillance of people's information online.

#### This is structured through the [affects of neoliberalism]{.underline}, by which the critical pedagogies of militarism operate through the [mundane]{.underline} interactions with academia, resolvable only through [critical]{.underline}, counter-conduct performances

**Zembylas 19** \[Michalinos Zembylas (2019): The affective dimension of
everyday resistance: implications for critical pedagogy in engaging with
neoliberalism's educational impact, Critical Studies in Education, DOI:
10.1080/17508487.2019.1617180\] // jz// -ekh-\]

My analysis has shown that whatever form neoliberalism is taken to be in
schools and universities, the neoliberal present has important affective
implications. [The [affective economies of neoliberalism]{.mark} that
[are produced in schools]{.mark} and universities create particular
'capacities to affect and be affected' for teachers and students alike.
[It is thus extremely important to develop methodological and
theoretical tools that]{.mark} [critically trace]{.mark} the capacities
of teachers and students for affecting and being affected in their
engagements and negotiations with [neoliberal education, and]{.mark}
specifically how **[these capacities are normalized, embodied or enable
alternative counter-practices]{.mark}** (Zembylas, 2018b).]{.underline}
Hence, what is required is a continued critical engagement with
neoliberalism's educational impact in ways that take into consideration
the affective potentialities of resistance. Considering the affective
potentialities of resistance in critical pedagogy can be the starting
point for alternatives visions of educational policies and practices
that challenge forms of neoliberal education. [I would argue, then, that
what is needed in the study of resistance in [critical pedagogy]{.mark}
is what Thrift (2008) calls a micro-biopolitical approach (Thrift, 2008)
which understands the complexities and ambivalences of neoliberal
affects and [norms]{.mark} that [operate at the mundane]{.mark},
ordinary, and [everyday level in schools]{.mark} and universities and
the consequences that are produced (Zembylas, 2018b). This
micro-biopolitical approach on conceptualizing resistance in critical
pedagogy is valuable not only because [it]{.mark} pays attention to the
affective consequences of mechanisms and techniques of neoliberal
education in schools and universities, but also because it
[invokes]{.mark} what Braidotti (2013) terms '[**affirmative**
**critique'**]{.mark} (see also Staunæs, 2016). An affirmative critique
in critical pedagogy, for example, **is the** sort [of **critical
engagement**]{.mark} with ideas 10 M. ZEMBYLAS and things **[that
creates affective spaces for alternative counter-conduct
practices]{.mark}** against neoliberal education.]{.underline} In other
words, recognizing the affective dimension of resistance in critical
pedagogy creates openings for an affirmative critique that has the
potential to transform teachers' and students' capacities to affect and
be affected. In considering the approach I am suggesting here to affect
and resistance in critical pedagogy, one can indeed raise several
questions and concerns such as: How may critical pedagogy itself
function as an 'apparatus of power' (Anderson, 2014) which uses affect
to mobilize resistance towards certain ideologies or structures such as
neoliberalism? How are these mobilizations of resistance connected to
broader collective conditions and processes of resisting certain
ideologies or structures at the macro-political level? How do teachers'
and students' practices and bodily capacities reproduce or enrich
certain mobilizations of resistance through their encounters? How can
those practices and bodily capacities be reproductive, adaptive or
resistant, whether intentionally or not? (e.g. see McKenzie, 2017).
There are no definitive answers to these questions, but they must be
posed to show the complexities and ambivalences emerging from attempts
to link affect and resistance in critical pedagogy. [Hence, I would
argue that [any viable **theorization of resistance** in critical
pedagogy **must not be limited to 'conventional' understandings of
resistance**]{.mark} but must emphasize how affects condition the ways
neoliberalism emerges, circulate and are transformed by forms of
resistance waged by teachers and students.]{.underline} Greater
acknowledgment of the ways in which schools and universities play a
fundamental role in the affective conduct of individuals, encouraging
and directing the self-perceptions, economic behavior and
socio-political actions of students, citizens, and workers (Odysseos &
Pal, 2018) will renew theorization of resistance in critical pedagogy in
two ways. First, by gesturing toward the particular ways in which
affects come to have force and socio-political significance, critical
pedagogy disconnects resistance from a psychologized perspective or a
perspective that defines resistance in dualistic terms as a matter of
either human agency or social structure. This would mean, for instance,
recognizing that resistance is not a set of individualized actions but
rather it is very much embedded in the affective infrastructures of
neoliberal education. To create renewed affective relations and
assemblages as counter-conduct in schools and universities, then, would
essentially mean to invent new affective practices that instigate
empowerment and resistance against the various manifestations of
neoliberal education. As Alldred and Fox (2017) conclude: It is
therefore more accurate to see power and resistance as dual fluxes that
permeate all assemblages, a shifting balance that is never finally
settled. Defining a certain affect as an assertion of power or an effort
at resistance is less important than assessing the capacities that these
affects produce. (p. 1171) For example, it is argued that 'affective
solidarity' is necessary for a sustainable politics of transformation
(Hemmings, 2012). Hemmings proposes an approach that moves away from
rooting transformation in politics of identity and towards modes of
engagement that start from the affective dissonance experience can
produce. Although affective dissonance with the experience of
neoliberalism's educational impact, for instance, cannot guarantee a
resistant mode, 'that sense of dissonance might become a sense of
injustice and then a desire to rectify that' (Hemmings, 2012, CRITICAL
STUDIES IN EDUCATION 11 p. 157). [The recognition of affective
dissonance as the point of departure for a possible affective solidarity
among teachers and student highlights that [**affective dissonance with
neoliberalism's educational impact** may be a productive basis from
which to seek solidarity with others -- not based on a shared identity
or ideology, but on **feeling the desire for transforming the injustices
inflicted by neoliberal policies and practices**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Second, the recognition of the affective dimension of resistance in
critical pedagogy helps us understand the affective present in and
beyond schools and universities as a series of processes and practices
in 'the everyday' in which the focus is on the actions that are
mobilized to produce something rather than on their representations or
what they supposedly mean. By examining the consequences of affects at
the micropolitical level, resistance can be understood in terms of the
ways actions produce capacities to affect and be affected, that is, 'in
terms of the forces circulating in assemblage and the consequent
capacities that are produced in assembled relations, including human
bodies and subjectivities' (Alldred & Fox, 2017, p. 1171). Calling upon
theoretical insights in critical pedagogy that recognize and examine the
affective dimension of everyday resistance is likely to challenge the
'invisible' infrastructures of neoliberal education in schools and
universities. All in all, the call for a critical pedagogy to
acknowledge the affective dimension of resistance marks an important and
necessary moment that allows critical pedagogy to be further enriched in
attempts to address the challenges faced by teachers and students in
neoliberal education. Schools and universities are at a critical
juncture whether and how they will be able to develop pedagogies and
ideas that neither return to an idealized, pre-neoliberal past, nor
expect a sudden revolution but instead resist against the
self-formations involved by neoliberalism (Odysseos & Pal, 2018). What I
have offered here is an attempt to illuminate the affective dimension of
resistance and its implications for critical pedagogy through
theoretical insights that enhance individual and collective capacity for
counter-conduct in neoliberal contexts. Being attentive to the
complexities and potential ambivalences in teachers' and students' forms
of resistance enhances our analysis of how critical pedagogy more
broadly, and schools and universities more specifically, are themselves
implicated in transformations of neoliberal education (Odysseos & Pal,
2018).

#### Thus, we affirm a [pessimistic reading]{.underline} of the empire, the night side of IR theory -- an [optimistic analysis]{.underline} of worlds-to-be that views modern IR as a [failed practice]{.underline} that refuses the violence of the [pure dark war]{.underline}

[Why would I bother with [the "**night side" of ir
theory**]{.mark}?]{.underline}47 In part[, I wish [to **move away from
the rationalist fallacy**]{.mark} among both defenders and critics of
empire.]{.underline} [There is [a **shared belief in the strategic
competence** of nations]{.mark} like the United States]{.underline}.
[[Even those most vocally critical]{.mark} often [see]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} the [**covert operations** and]{.mark} **vast [military
occupations]{.mark}** [a]{.mark} kind of [purpose]{.mark} or conspiracy.
[The debate]{.mark} about empire then [becomes]{.mark} [about]{.mark}
its [moral virtue rather than]{.mark} the factual question of the
strategic [competence]{.mark} of imperial states]{.underline}. However,
[the [**lives of millions annihilated** in **Iraq**]{.mark}, [**Yemen**,
**Afghanistan**, and]{.mark}]{.underline} now increasingly throughout
the [**continent of [Africa]{.mark}** [do not reflect an amoral
strategic competence]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The **mass murder** in
pursuit of the **war on terrorism** and its **vision of
nation-building** is the result of **lethal \[ignorance\]**]{.underline}
]{.mark}~~stupidity~~.48 In some sense, the investigative journalism of
Jeremy Scahill and Glen Greenwald attributes too much reason and order
to the catastrophic floundering of the American empire.49 [To see even a
dark vision of order in the last thirty years of U.S. policy is itself a
form of optimism. [**No one is in control**, **there is no
conspiracy**]{.mark}, and **[yet the killing
continues]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[A pessimistic reading]{.mark} of
U.S. empire and the geopolitical history that precedes it [is neither
tragedy nor farce]{.mark}. It is a catastrophic banality lacking in any
and all history, a pile of nonevents so suffocating that we often hope
for a conspiracy, punctuating event, or villain worthy of the scale of
violence]{.underline}.50 For those of us who continually rewatch the
reruns of The Walking Dead and Jericho on our laptops in bed, we are
waiting for relief in our privileged but increasingly fragile bubble. I
know I am not the only one who finds respite from the weight of
politics' "cruel optimism" by watching fantasies of cruel pessimism. [[A
pessimistic]{.mark} [understanding]{.mark} of global politics [helps
explain how we could come to a place where there is]{.mark} a sense of
[relief]{.mark} in watching everything come to an end.]{.underline}51
[**Failed ir** affirms the power of this kind of negative thinking as an
**alternative** to the **endless rehearsing of moralizing insights** and
**strategic foresight.** The negative is not "against" or reacting to
something]{.underline}. Rather, [it is [the affirmation of a freedom
beyond the limits of life and]{.mark} [death]{.mark}. That is, it is
making a life by continuing [to think about the world]{.mark},
[even]{.mark} [if]{.mark} that thinking is [not recuperative]{.mark},
and [even if nothing we think]{.mark} [can save us]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In the face of it all, one celebrates useless thinking, useless
scholarship, and useless forms of life at the very moment we are told to
throw them all under the bus in the name of survival at all costs. This
is a logic referred to lately as hope and it is as cruel as it is
anxiety inducing. [Hope is a form of extortion. We are told that it is
our obligation to bear the weight of making things better while being
chided that the failure of our efforts is the result of not believing in
the possibility of real change.]{.underline} In such an environment,
pessimism is often treated as a form of treason, as if only neoliberals
and moral degenerates give up---or so goes the op-ed's insisting upon
the renewed possibility of redemption. In response to these
exhortations, pessimism offers a historical atheism, both
methodologically and morally. The universe does not bend toward justice.
Sometimes the universe bends toward the indifference of gravity wells
and black holes. [Affirming [negativity]{.mark}]{.underline}, inspired
by Achille Mbembe, [[is]{.mark} grounds for
[freedom]{.mark},]{.underline} even if that freedom or relief is only
fleeting and always insecure. I am not arrogant enough to think a book
can attain freedom of this sort, but this book is inspired by refusals
of critique as redemption in favor of useless critique and critique for
its own sake. That the pursuit of knowledge without immediate
application is so thoroughly useless, even profane, is a diagnosis of
our current moment. The neoliberal assault on the university is evidence
of this condition, as is the current pitch of American politics. Our
indifference as intellectuals to maximizing value has not gone
unnoticed. We are still dangerous, worthy of vilification, of attack,
sabotage, and derision because we fail so decadently. We are parasites
according to Scott Walker, Donald Trump, and the rest. So be it. We are
and shall remain irascible irritants to a worldwide assault on thinking
that is well underway and facing few obstacles in other jurisdictions.
What would failed scholarship do? Learn to die, learn to live, learn to
listen, learn to be together, and learn to be generous. These virtues
are useless in that they do not prevent or manage things. They do not
translate into learning objectives or metrics. Virtues of this order are
selfsame, nontransferable experiences. They are meaningful but not
useful. These are luxurious virtues. Like grieving or joy, they are ends
unto themselves. But how will these ideas seek extramural grants,
contribute to an outcomes-based education system, or become a policy
recommendation? They will not, and that is part of their virtue. [Even
if there is no straight line to where we are and where we ought to
be]{.underline}, I [think [we should **get over the idea** that]{.mark}
somehow [**the U.S. project of liberal empire is conflicted**,]{.mark}
or **["more right]{.mark} [than it is wrong,"]{.mark}** [or
**pragmatically preferable to the alternatives**]{.mark}. I hope this
book can contribute to the urgent necessity to get out of the way by
reveling in the catastrophic failure that should inspire humility but
instead seems to embolden too many to seek global control yet again.
[Demolition may be an affirmative act if it means insurgents and others
can be better heard]{.mark}.]{.underline} And yet this may fail too. If
we can accomplish nothing at all, we can at least, as Ta-Nehisi Coates
and other pessimists have said, refuse to suborn the lie of America any
longer. [Telling the truth, even if it cannot change the outcome of
history, is a certain kind of solace.]{.underline} In Coates's words,
[there is a kind of rapture "when you can no longer be lied to, when you
have rejected the dream]{.underline}."52 Saying the truth out loud
brings with it the relief that we are not ~~crazy~~. Things really are
as bad as we think. [If there are those of us who want to break from
this one-hundred-year-old race to be the next Henry Kissinger, then
**[why do we continue to seek respect in the form of recognizable
standards of excellence]{.mark}**?]{.underline} I am not sure where the
answer finally lies, but I do know that [professionalization will not
save us. To appear as normal and recognizably rigorous will not be
enough to stave off the neoliberal drive to monetize scholarship, or to
demand of us strategically useful insights]{.underline}. The least we
can do in the face of such a battle is to find comfort in meaningful
ideas and the friendships they build rather than try to perform for
those we know are the problem. Some will ask, who is this "we" or is
that "they"---where is your evidence? More will know exactly what I am
talking about. [The virtues I seek are oriented toward an academy of
refuge, a place we can still live, no matter how dire the conditions of
the university and the classroom. It is not the think tank, boardroom,
or command center. We are, those of us who wish to be included, the last
of the philosophers, the last of the lovers of knowledge]{.underline},
the deviants who should revel in what Harney and Moten have called the
undercommons. 53 In one of his final lectures, Bataille speaks of the
remnants of a dif­ferent human species, something not quite so doomed,
something that wasted its newly discovered consciousness and tool-being
on the art that still marks the walls of prehistoric caves.54 This
lingering minor or vestigial heritage is philosophy's beginning.
[[Philosophy survives war, atrocity, famine, and crusades.
Thinking]{.mark} [matters in a]{.mark} very [unusual
way]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thinking is not power or emancipation.
[Thinking matters for [a sense of belonging]{.mark} to the world, and
[for believing in the fecundity of]{.mark} [the world despite evidence
to the contrary]{.mark}.]{.underline} How do you get all this from
pessimism, from failure? Because [willing failure is a temptation, a
lure to think otherwise, to think dangerous thoughts. [Pessimism is a
threat to indifferentism and nihilism]{.mark}]{.underline} in the sense
of the phenomenon of Donald Trump. [Pessimism is [a provocation and an
enemy]{.mark} [of skepticism, particularly]{.mark} of [the metaphysical
variety]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is not redemption from these
afflictions, but in pessimism there is solace in the real. To put it
another way, [[to study the world as it is means to care for it.]{.mark}
The exhortation that our care or interest should be contingent on how
useful the world is and how much of it conforms to our designs is as
much opposed to care as it is to empiricism]{.underline}. We can study
airports, poetry, endurance races, borders, bombs, plastic, and warfare,
and find them all in the world. [To consider the depth of]{.underline}
their [existence can be an invitation to the world rather than a prelude
to another policy report.]{.underline} One cannot make a successful
political career out of such pursuits, but you might be able to make a
life out of it, a life worth repeating even if nothing else happens. At
the end of Jack Halberstam's The Queer Art of Failure, we are presented
with the Fantastic Mr. Fox's toast as an exemple of something meaningful
in these dark times of ours. They say all foxes are slightly allergic to
linoleum, but it's cool to the paw---try it. They say my tail needs to
be dry cleaned twice a month, but now it's fully detachable---see? They
say our tree may never grow back, but one day, something will. Yes,
these crackles are made of synthetic goose and these giblets come from
artificial squab and even these apples look fake---but at least they've
got stars on them. I guess my point is, we'll eat tonight, and we'll eat
together. And even in this not particularly flattering light, you are
without a doubt the five and a half most wonderful wild animals I've
ever met in my life. So let's raise our boxes---to our survival.
Halberstam says of this queer moment: Not quite a credo, something short
of a toast, a little less than a speech, but Mr. Fox gives here one of
the best and most moving---both emotionally and in stop-motion
terms---addresses in the history of cinema. Unlike Coraline, where
survival is predicated upon a rejection of the theatrical, the queer,
and the improvised, and like Where the Wild Things Are, where the
disappointment of deliverance must be leavened with the pragmatism of
possibility, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a queerly animated classic in that it
teaches us, as Finding Nemo, Chicken Run, and so many other revolting
animations before it, to believe in detachable tails, fake apples,
eating together, adapting to the lighting, risk, sissy sons, and the
sheer importance of survival for all those wild souls that the farmers,
the teachers, the preachers, and the politicians would like to bury
alive.55 Although not as much fun as Halberstam's monument to low
theory, [Savage Ecology is for all the other wild animals out there
studying global politics. [May we be buried alive
together]{.mark}]{.underline}
