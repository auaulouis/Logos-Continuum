What Are the Pros and Cons of a Predictive Approach to Social Science?

[The main pro is that the predictive enterprise helps us evaluate how
well we are doing so that we can improve our understanding of the
world]{.underline}. It is the gold standard of a scientific approach. We
do not yet have an experimental framework for many important subjects.
As a result, it is important to make sure we can get the same kind of
results with new information that we got with the data we began
investigating. That means we have to either save some data back (a great
idea), use the future to see how well our modeled understandings
perform, or preferably both. There are only nascent traditions of this
in the social sciences at present. Keeping track of your success is not
collecting significant coefficients. Keeping track matters. One
consequence is that we cannot just keep using the same data over and
over. And over. One reason that many hate predictions is that talking
heads make many predictions in the media, but few of them ever keep
track of how well they are doing. Their goal is somewhat akin to a
venture capitalist's make enough bets that eventually one of them is
correct enough that you get to make a lot more bets. Ascher (1979) long
ago showed that the talking heads were most often wrong. This is still
true. You would think that they would get better over time, but there is
little evidence that this is the case.

[We also will be driven into making more **precise investigations** once
we start to predict. We will not be satisfied with annual data for most
things. Nor will we necessarily be satisfied with national-level
information because it becomes even more apparent in the predictive
domain that the world is neither flat nor homogeneous. As a result, we
should get more precise understandings of how things play out in our
social world.]{.underline} At the same time, we have to recognize that
our predictions are probabilistic and contain a large amount of
uncertainty, more so than in other endeavors.

As a result of these two aspects, better and more precise understandings
of our social world, it is possible to be more relevant to decision
makers at all levels. This does not mean just inside the beltway. It
also means decision makers at CDC (Centers for Disease Control) as well
as those in non-governmental organizations around the world.

What are the cons? Several arguments are usually brought to the fore.

[1. The world is inherently unpredictable. But we are studying it
anyway. Go figure. The refrain to this litany is often "but I know what
is going to happen in this instance." Maybe, but **let us keep track and
find out if you are right**. This is the talking heads premise, and it
is demonstrably false**. Making cause and effect statements about
politics does imply that politics is** in part, at least,
**predictable.**]{.underline}

2\. This will empower the establishment and impoverish those without
power. Actually, it might. But at the same time, it provides ways in
which those outside the capitals can also affect the future. Why will
prediction be more valuable to the establishment than it is to the rest
of society? Is the same thing true of explanation and substantive
knowledge? Western society is based in part on the idea that knowledge
is a valuable thing for all. It is true that some take more advantage of
it than others. But having open and available knowledge can be important
for many diverse groups. As an example, we might think that clandestine
organizations can benefit from open knowledge, even precise actionable
knowledge, but as we think these thoughts, most of us might not be
thinking about transnational activist networks but rather large
governmental organizations. However, it is clear that non-governmental
actors are also consumers of knowledge.

3\. It is possible to predict things without true understanding or
knowledge. Sure, but rarely is this true for any but the simplest of
systems. I am reminded of the wonderful essay by Calvin Trillin
describing the chicken on Mott Street in New York's Chinatown that
played and always won Tic-Tac-Toe. The chicken did not understand the
game. But the chicken always won.6 It is ridiculous to suggest that we
have models that predict as accurately as the (now gone) Mott Street
chicken but have the same understanding of the "chicken" game. Even if
it were the case (and I repeat it is not), could the opposite really be
true? If you have deep understanding of the world, should you not be
able to generate accurate predictions of how it will work in situations
you have not seen before? Will proximate effects lead us toward distant
causes much like proximate causes can lead us to distant effects?

4\. We will disrupt the space-time continuum. [If we can predict
conflict, for example, we will be able to prevent it. Or start it where
we want. And then we will no longer be able to predict conflict. One of
my models attempts to predict where there will be coups de e´tat and
other types of irregular regime changes on a monthly level.]{.underline}
Maybe if Muhammadu Buhari, who assumed the presidency of Nigeria at the
end of May 2015, sees our manuscript, he might be able to prevent any
irregular leadership change from occurring in the next six months. And
maybe that would be bad. Or good. But in any case, I am pretty sure that
the Nigerian president is already aware of the fragility of the Nigerian
political landscape. This is a frequent type of criticism of
forecasting. I think we can wait for this to become a real problem
before we stop trying to develop better understandings of the world.

5\. Real social effects occur glacially. Predictions will be focused on
epiphenomenal changes that won't matter in the long run. How do you
know?

In summary, we need less theory because most theory is an attempt to
rescue or adapt extant theory[. We need more predictions in order to
**keep track of how well we understand the world around us**. They will
tell us how good our theories are and where we need better
explanations.]{.underline} Predictions are like cell phones. First, they
seem arcane and bizarre. Then, in a few short years, there is no one
around who remembers life without cell phones and your kids use them in
ways you don't understand. The 2012 US presidential election was the
first that was famously and accurately predicted. But it will be the
first of many. All future voters will vote in an era in which accurately
predicting the election will be the norm, not the exception, though as
in the UK in 2015, there will be exceptions. This will have consequences
for democracy. In the same way that having a product recommended to us
on the web is now normal, this will become the new normal. Data science
(and more data) will guide us to a better understanding of our future
than we have now. [Whether you are involved with commercial
organizations, local government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
the federal government, or international organizations, prediction will
be part of the daily ebb and flow of information, and we shall become
used to seeing accurate predictions about a wide variety of political
phenomena.]{.underline}
