THE PENTAGON WASTES YOUR MONEY

There are plenty of reasons to cut the [Pentagon's]{.underline} budget,
but its track record of [profligate spending]{.underline} is among the
[most obvious]{.underline}. [If]{.underline} the [Pentagon]{.underline}
[were]{.underline} a [private]{.underline} [corporation]{.underline},
gross [**mismanagement would have forced** it **into**
**bankruptcy**]{.underline} [years]{.underline} [ago.]{.underline}
**[Dysfunctional]{.underline} [internal controls]{.underline}**,
**[aided]{.underline}** and abetted [**by** years of
**lax**]{.underline} congressional and administration
**[oversight]{.underline}**, have [enabled it to waste]{.underline} tens
of [billions]{.underline} of dollars annually, [and]{.underline} the
[last **20 years**]{.underline} are [**littered** **with**]{.underline}
a parade of [overpriced, **botched** and bungled]{.underline}
**[projects]{.underline}**.

In just the first decade of this century, the [Pentagon was forced to
cancel a dozen ill-conceived, ineffective weapons programs that cost
taxpayers [\$46
billion](https://www.military.com/defensetech/2011/07/19/46-billion-worth-of-cancelled-programs)]{.underline}.
They included the [Future Combat Systems
program](https://www.defensenews.com/30th-annivesary/2016/10/25/30-years-future-combat-systems-acquisition-gone-wrong/),
a fleet of networked high-tech vehicles that did not work; the [Comanche
helicopter](https://nation.time.com/2012/05/25/real-lessons-from-an-unreal-helicopter/),
which---after 22 years in development---was never built; and the
40-ton [Crusader artillery
gun](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2002-05-09-0205090111-story.html),
which never even made it to the prototype stage.

To put this example of managerial malfeasance in context, these canceled
programs collectively cost [more than]{.underline} the
[fed]{.underline}eral
government [[spent](https://www.epa.gov/planandbudget/budget) on
th]{.underline}e Environmental Protection Agency ([EPA]{.underline})
[over the last five years]{.underline}.

At least the Pentagon killed those projects before they wasted any more
money. All too often, it does not know when to pull the plug. The
[Army's attempt to]{.underline} [replace]{.underline} its outmoded
[Bradley tank is a case in point]{.underline}. [Over the last 17 years,
it has blown an estimated [\$22.9
billion](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/army-decided-replace-bradley-fighting-vehicles-17-years-22b-ago-ncna1136141) on
three flawed prototypes]{.underline}, but in February---just three weeks
after rejecting the third failed design---it [issued]{.underline} yet
[another request for]{.underline} [proposals]{.underline} from defense
contractors.

Then there are [programs]{.underline} the **[Pentagon]{.underline}**
continues to [**green-light with zero** **assurance they
will**]{.underline} ever **[perform]{.underline} [as
advertised]{.underline}**. Exhibit A: The [Pentagon]{.underline} has
[wasted]{.underline} [more]{.underline} [than [\$67
billion](https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/692136.pdf)]{.underline} [since]{.underline}
the [late]{.underline} 19[90]{.underline}s [on]{.underline} a [ballistic
missile defense system]{.underline} [that [has never been demonstrated
to
work](https://blog.ucsusa.org/elliott-negin/missile-defense-risks)]{.underline} in
a real-world situation. A spawn of Ronald Reagan's Star Wars fantasy,
the system---based in Alaska and California---will never be able to
defend the continental United States from a limited nuclear attack. Any
country capable of launching a ballistic missile could easily foil the
system with [decoys and other
countermeasures](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/decoys-used-missile-defense-intercept-tests).

Another prime example is the [F-35 Joint Strike
Fighter](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/magazine/f35-joint-strike-fighter-program.html).
Expected to cost [\$1.5
trillion](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/f35-fighter-jet-pentagon/) over
its lifespan, it has the dubious distinction of being the Department of
Defense's most expensive weapons program of all time. The [490 **F-35s**
built since]{.underline} the **[first prototype]{.underline}** flew
**[20 years ago]{.underline}** [continue]{.underline} [to
be **[plagued](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/a30718538/f-35-flaws/) by**]{.underline}
a [**dozen** serious **flaws**]{.underline} and **[nearly 900
software]{.underline} [defects]{.underline}**, and roughly [half of the
fleet]{.underline} in 2017 and 2018 was [grounded for
maintenance]{.underline}. Regardless, the Pentagon still plans to
buy [2,400
more](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/f-35-takes-flak-but-still-flying-high) F-35s
over the next 25 years.

The F-35 is just one of the malfunctioning weapons systems on the
Pentagon's
current [\$1.8-trillion](https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-20-439#summary) shopping
list of overpriced aircraft, missiles, ships, satellites and tanks.
Other poor performers include the \$22-billion [Zumwalt
destroyer](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/after-sinking-billions-its-stealth-destroyers-navy-needs-more-money-keep-them-afloat),
a warship without a mission; the \$30-billion [littoral combat
ship](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/navy-spent-30b-16-years-fight-iran-littoral-combat-ship-ncna1031806),
which the Navy is already mothballing because it is virtually unusable;
and the Air Force's problem-plagued \$43-billion [KC-46 refueling
tanker](https://www.defensenews.com/air/2020/06/09/the-air-force-delays-a-full-rate-production-decision-for-the-kc-46/),
which offers little improvement over current refuelers.

But it is not only exorbitant hardware that picks taxpayer pockets.
[Pentagon]{.underline} administrative costs are also [out of
control]{.underline}. A January 2015 report by a [federal]{.underline}
[advisory panel found]{.underline} that the **[Pentagon could
save [\$125
billion](https://www.defensenews.com/2015/01/23/dod-business-panel-proposes-125b-in-savings/)]{.underline}** in
administrative waste by [**streamlining** its **bloated
bureaucracy**]{.underline}. That sum alone is 15 times more than
the [\$8.3
billion](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/488521-trump-reverses-on-request-to-cut-cdc-niaid-funding) the
Trump administration proposes to spend in the next fiscal year to fund
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during one of the worst
pandemics in modern history.

#### More funds exacerbate existing ineffectiveness 

**Manjoo 1/13** (Farhad Manjoo, New York Times columnist, 1-13-2022, "We
Must Stop Showering the Military With Money", The New York Times,
accessed 6-22-2022,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/opinion/military-budget-build-back-better.html>
)//kp

Last month, Senator Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who has
frustrated much of President Biden's policy agenda, released [a
statement](https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-statement-on-build-back-better-act) confirming
what he'd been hinting for weeks. He [would not
vote](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/19/us/politics/manchin-build-back-better.html) for
the Build Back Better Act, the Democrats' \$2.2 trillion 10-year plan to
address climate change and invest in child care, health care and
education. Manchin argued it would increase inflation, harm the
electricity grid and hamper national security and was simply just too
"mammoth" and "sweeping" to support.

"I have always said, 'If I can't go back home and explain it, I can't
vote for it,'"
he [said](https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-statement-on-build-back-better-act).

I don't doubt the political wisdom of Manchin's pledge to support only
what he can explain. I do wonder, though, how he applies his maxim to a
far more mammoth, more sweeping piece of the federal budget: the nearly
three-quarters of a trillion dollars that we are spending this year on a
military that has become the [epitome of governmental
dysfunction](https://www.pogo.org/analysis/2021/11/the-pentagons-yearly-blank-check/), [self-dealing](https://www.pogo.org/analysis/2022/01/the-bunker-the-pentagons-revolting-door/) and
overspending.

Of course, I'm only kidding. I don't actually wonder about Manchin's
stance on showering the Department of Defense with more money than it
asks for, even [more than it seems to know what to do
with](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-25/pentagon-has-returned-unused-128-billion-to-the-u-s-since-2009).
Right around the time he was bayoneting Build Back
Better, [Manchin](https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-applauds-senate-passage-of-national-defense-authorization-act-secures-west-virginia-priorities) joined
87 other senators --- [Democrats and Republicans]{.underline} --- in
rubber-stamping another [gargantuan
budget](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/us/politics/defense-spending-bill.html) for
the Pentagon. They [allocated \$768 billion for]{.underline} the
military [in 2022]{.underline}, roughly [\$24 billion more
than]{.underline} the [White House requested]{.underline} from Congress.

Given all the challenges we face at home, does it make any sense to keep
spending so many hundreds of billions on the Pentagon? And even just in
terms of fighting wars, can anyone be satisfied with the way the
military is managing its funds? The Pentagon has never passed an audit
and says it may not be [able to until
2028](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/19/997961646/the-pentagon-has-never-passed-an-audit-some-senators-want-to-change-that).

[In 2020]{.underline} the U.S. [military's budget accounted for [almost
40
percent](https://sipri.org/sites/default/files/2021-04/fs_2104_milex_0.pdf) of]{.underline}
the world's [military expenditures]{.underline}. This level of [spending
has]{.underline} long [been excessive]{.underline}, but after a pandemic
that has claimed the lives of more Americans
than [any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/12/02/covid-19-has-killed-more-americans-than-civil-war-how-do-we-memorialize-them/) [war
we
fought](https://www.va.gov/opa/publications/factsheets/fs_americas_wars.pdf),
[continuing to]{.underline} [throw money at the military is an act of
willful disregard for]{.underline} the most [urgent threats]{.underline}
we face.

According to a [projection by the Congressional Budget
Office](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-02/56970-Outlook.pdf#page=10),
[Congress is projected to spend]{.underline} about [\$8.5 trillion for
the military]{.underline} over [the next decade]{.underline} --- about
[half a trillion more than]{.underline} is budgeted for [all nonmilitary
discretionary programs]{.underline} combined (a category
that [includes](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/non-defense-discretionary-programs) federal
spending on education, public health, scientific research,
infrastructure, national parks and forests, environmental protection,
law enforcement, courts, tax collection, foreign aid, homeland security
and health care for veterans).

You don't have to be a pacifist to wonder if this imbalance between
military and nonmilitary spending makes sense. [When we]{.underline}
[face so many other]{.underline} major [challenges]{.underline} ---
[from climate]{.underline} disasters [to political
instability]{.underline} and insurrection --- [shouldn't we
ask]{.underline} [whether it remains wise to keep handing the
military]{.underline} what is effectively [a blank check]{.underline}?
Are such lavish resources even good for national defense, or might the
[Pentagon's near-bottomless access to funds]{.underline} have
[encouraged]{.underline} a [[culture of
waste](https://www.pogo.org/analysis/2016/01/millions-of-dollars-wasted-in-afghan-extractives-program/) and
indulgence]{.underline} that [made it easier to blunder into Iraq and
contributed to]{.underline} its [failures
in [Afghanistan](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/09/world/middleeast/afghanistan-war-cost.html)]{.underline}?

This gets to what's most frustrating about the Pentagon's enormous
budget: the halo of protection it enjoys in our political culture.
Despite the Pentagon's numerous missteps, our representatives too rarely
ask how much money for the military may be way too much money for the
military. We have long national debates about [whether it makes sense to
spend on things like parental
leave](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/23/paid-family-leave-how-lawmakers-could-compromise-on-build-back-better.html) or
college tuition, but lawmakers seldom expect such rigor from the Defense
Department. For example, why should we [keep building aircraft
carriers](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/weapons/RS20643.pdf) --- each of which
costs [about \$1.5 billion a year to
operate](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files?file=2021-05/57088-AppendixA.pdf) ---
when we've already got most of the world's fleet of active aircraft
carriers? (We've got 11; no other nation has more than two, though China
may be [launching a
third](https://www.csis.org/analysis/signs-point-chinas-third-aircraft-carrier-launching-soon) soon.)

There is ample evidence that Congress's reluctance to ask basic
questions of the [Pentagon]{.underline} has [harmed]{.underline}, rather
than helped, the [military's effectiveness]{.underline}. Consider the
boondoggle that is [the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program]{.underline}
--- the plan the Pentagon conceived [in the
1990s](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/magazine/f35-joint-strike-fighter-program.html) to
build a new plane, which is expected to cost taxpayers [more than \$1
trillion](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/opinion/f-35-fighter-jet-cost.html) over
its 60-year life span. A [recent
[audit]{.underline}](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-226) from the
Government Accountability Office [found]{.underline} that [even the
Pentagon's extended timeline for when the plane might finally go into
full production is "not achievable]{.underline}," and there were more
than 850 "open deficiencies" in the project as of November 2020. I
wonder if Manchin could explain to his constituents how tolerating such
a level of mismanagement is good for our security.

I also wonder if Manchin could explain the [staggering size and
top-heaviness of]{.underline} the [Pentagon's]{.underline} **staffing**
--- why [the [ratio of enlisted troops to officers is
declining](https://www.pogo.org/analysis/2021/12/the-bunker-star-creep/)]{.underline} across
the U.S. forces, [[cluttering the chain of
command](https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Publications/Article/1325984/are-there-too-many-general-officers-for-todays-military/) with
layers of bureaucracy.]{.underline} A 2015 internal study found that the
[Pentagon [employed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/pentagon-buries-evidence-of-125-billion-in-bureaucratic-waste/2016/12/05/e0668c76-9af6-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html?utm_term=.b4f9548f160e)]{.underline} (or
hired contractors to employ) [nearly as many deskbound]{.underline},
back-office [people as it had active-duty troops]{.underline}. The
report found that it [could save \$125 billion]{.underline} a year by,
among other measures, [reducing overstaffing]{.underline} through
retirements and attrition. The Pentagon buried that report, [according
to The Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/pentagon-buries-evidence-of-125-billion-in-bureaucratic-waste/2016/12/05/e0668c76-9af6-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html?utm_term=.b4f9548f160e).

Not only do lawmakers give the Pentagon a free pass on its budget;
sometimes they even force the agency to keep the little fat it's trying
to trim. The Air Force says that it's ready to retire its fleet of A-10
Warthogs, fighter airplanes that date back to the 1970s.
Congress [forbade](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/budget/2021/07/23/senate-policy-bill-rejects-air-force-request-to-send-some-a-10s-in-the-boneyard/) [any
such
reduction](https://breakingdefense.com/2021/12/congress-approves-retirement-of-160-air-force-planes-with-one-notable-exception/) in
2022.

Starting in 2017, Congress even required each military service to
submit [an annual wish list of "unfunded
priorities"](https://www.ntu.org/publications/detail/congress-should-do-away-with-dod-unfunded-priorities-lists-a-multibillion-dollar-wish-list-boondoggle) ---
that is, goodies that the services might want but that the White House
had not requested in its budget. It has since become routine for
Congress to not only give the Pentagon [much of what it asks
for](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2021/07/29/lawmakers-cave-to-wish-lists-and-give-the-pentagon-money-it-doesnt-need/) but
also ladle
on [extras](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-07/congress-should-end-the-military-s-wish-lists?sref=B3uFyqJT).

The reasons such spending persists aren't a big mystery. [The
military-industrial complex is every bit as politically powerful as
Dwight Eisenhower
warned](https://www.pogo.org/analysis/2021/11/afghanistan-proved-eisenhower-correct/) it
would be. (A recent Wall Street Journal headline [captured the situation
well](https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-won-in-afghanistan-private-contractors-troops-withdrawal-war-pentagon-11640988154):
"Who Won in Afghanistan? Private Contractors.") In another trick, the
military spreads its contracts to a [large number of congressional
districts](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/01/the-tragedy-of-the-american-military/383516/),
giving every lawmaker a reason to celebrate excessive military spending.
([Manchin put out a
statement](https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-applauds-senate-passage-of-national-defense-authorization-act-secures-west-virginia-priorities) taking
credit for all the benefits the new defense appropriation will bring to
West Virginia.)

And finally, there is plain patriotic posturing: Because every dollar to
the Pentagon can be defended as protecting the troops and the nation's
security, no politician will ever get in trouble for giving too much
money to the military.

Mandy Smithberger, who studies Pentagon excess at the Project on
Government Oversight, a nonpartisan independent group, told me that
while she has hopes that younger generations will begin to question the
military's excessive spending, the situation is unlikely to change
anytime soon.

"It's going to take members of Congress to really step up," she said.
That seems about as likely as pigs flying --- or, more aptly, F-35s.

#### More spending fails\-\--the military sucks

**De Rugy 3/10** (Veronique de Rugy, senior research fellow at George
Mason University, 3-10-2022, "More Defense Spending Does Not Equal More
Safety", Reason, accessed 6-28-2022,
<https://reason.com/2022/03/10/more-defense-spending-does-not-equal-more-safety/>
)//kp

The brutal [invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} by Russia has
[renewed]{.underline} [conservatives\']{.underline} [calls
for]{.underline} large [increases of our defense budget]{.underline}.
The extra money, we are told, would fund more weapons to better prepare
us to respond to aggression in a world that looks increasingly
dangerous. As compelling as these arguments can be in a stressful time,
it\'s not quite so simple.

[Providing military defense is]{.underline} a [valid]{.underline}
function of the federal government. However, that [doesn\'t give license
to]{.underline} [Congress to simply pile on more spending]{.underline},
even when there are dangers out there. Nor does it mean that more
spending will result in a completely safe world for us Americans.
That\'s in part because that world doesn\'t exist. There\'s only so much
safety money can buy.

While I certainly don\'t pretend to know what the optimal budget for our
military is, [we are already spending a large amount on national
security and on the Pentagon]{.underline}. In fiscal year 2023, the
[United States is expected to spend]{.underline} more [than \$770
billion on national defense]{.underline}, with \$729 billion of this
amount being for the Department of Defense\'s military operations. This
enormous sum is **[more than the next 10 countries
spend combined]{.underline}**. [Russia]{.underline}, for instance,
[spends close to \$62 billion]{.underline}. [France and Germany spend
almost \$53 billion]{.underline} each. Assuming [China\'s numbers
are]{.underline} accurate, it spends \$[252 billion]{.underline}.

When considering how much more money we think is worth spending, we must
keep in mind that [not **every**]{.underline} **[additional
dollar]{.underline}** of military spending [will result in enhanced
national]{.underline} security. That\'s because government
[intentions]{.underline} **[do not equal results]{.underline}**. Elected
officials and **[bureaucrats]{.underline}** **[have weak incentives
to]{.underline}** [sensibly]{.underline} **[manage]{.underline}** tax
**[dollars]{.underline}**. They are not rewarded for maximizing taxpayer
value, nor are they usually punished for unnecessary risks. In addition,
interest groups often drive political decisions that run counter to the
best interest of the public.

[Military spending is not immune from]{.underline} these forces any more
than the entitlement and welfare parts of the budget. Just look at the
[**arms-industry lobbying** machine]{.underline}, which in 2021 alone
spent \$117 million in lobbying expenditures and used 763 lobbyists,
[likely **pushing** **for** as much **Pentagon spending** as they can
get]{.underline}. This explains why Congress continues to allocate funds
to produce weapons that the Pentagon itself says it doesn\'t need. It
also [explains]{.underline} the [**endless** saga of]{.underline} its
**[cost overruns]{.underline}**, as well as **[delays and
malfunctions]{.underline}** such as those of the F-35. The
[Defense]{.underline} [Department]{.underline} has been allowed to [fail
its audits repeatedly]{.underline}, meaning [**no one really knows
where** some of that **money**]{.underline} **[goes]{.underline}**. The
result is a less-than-optimal allocation of our large defense budget.

These facts alone don\'t mean there are no grounds for the argument that
the military is underfunded to do everything Congress demands of it. In
2017, the American Enterprise Institute\'s Mackenzie [Eaglen argued for
more]{.underline} military [spending]{.underline} because \"the United
States now fields a military that could not meet even the requirements
of a benign Clinton-era world,\" and that \"while the United States
continues to field the best military personnel in the world, policy
makers have asked them to do too much with too little for too long.\"

I have no reason to doubt Eaglen\'s claim. [However, unless the
political system]{.underline} [that produced]{.underline} these [poor
outcomes is]{.underline} [reformed]{.underline}, [one should remain
skeptical about]{.underline} the effectiveness of even [more
spending]{.underline}.

What about the idea that we should annually spend four percent of our
GDP on defense, as opposed to the three percent we are now spending? I
find this argument lacking. As a measure of economic activity, [GDP has
very little to do with our ability to defend ourselves]{.underline}.
There\'s [no reason]{.underline} for three percent, four [percent, or
any other portion]{.underline} of GDP [to be considered]{.underline} the
[right]{.underline} number.

If the defense-spending-to-GDP measurement reflects anything, it\'s
affordability. That brings us to our enormous budget deficits and
resulting growing debt. Unless Congress cuts non-defense spending
significantly, growing the military budget would grow the deficit.
However, if additional defense spending is deficit-financed, then we can
expect slower growth, as Harvard economist Robert Barro and I
demonstrated in a study back in 2013. That reduces, not increases, the
affordability of our defense budget.

In other words, let\'s make sure we\'re asking the right questions
before rushing to jack up the defense budget.
