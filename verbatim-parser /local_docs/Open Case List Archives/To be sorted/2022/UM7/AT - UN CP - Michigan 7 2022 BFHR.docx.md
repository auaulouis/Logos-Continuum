### 2AC -- Solvency -- [AI]{.underline}

#### Political fights and lack of AI integration into systems wrecks interoperability

**Fournier-Tombs, 21 (**Eleonore Fournier-Tombs, 5-31-2021, \"The United
Nations needs to start regulating the \'Wild West\' of artificial
intelligence,\" Conversation,
<https://theconversation.com/the-united-nations-needs-to-start-regulating-the-wild-west-of-artificial-intelligence-161257>,
LASA-CSK)

Conversely, the [lack of regulation at the United Nations]{.underline}
can be [considered a challenge for]{.underline} [agencies
seeking]{.underline} to adopt [more effective and novel
technologies]{.underline}. As such, **[many systems]{.underline}** seem
to [**have been developed and l**ater **abandoned without being
integrated**]{.underline} into actual decision-making systems. An
example of this is [the Jetson tool]{.underline}, which was [developed
by UNHCR]{.underline} to predict the arrival of internally displaced
persons to refugee camps in Somalia. The tool [does not appear to have
been updated since 2019]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} seems [unlikely
to transition into the]{.underline} humanitarian [organization's
operations.]{.underline} Unless, that is, it can be properly certified
by a new regulatory system. [Trust in AI is difficult to
obtain]{.underline}, [particularly in United Nations]{.underline} work,
wh[ich is highly political and affects very vulnerable
populations]{.underline}. The onus has largely been on data scientists
to develop the credibility of their tools.

#### Slaughterbots prove unanimity makes UN regulation of AI [impossible]{.underline}

**Shaed, 21** (Sam Shead, 12-17-2021, "UN talks to ban 'slaughterbots'
collapsed --- here's why that matters," CNBC,
<https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/22/un-talks-to-ban-slaughterbots-collapsed-heres-why-that-matters.html>,
LASA-CSK)

[A UN conference failed to agree on banning the use and development
of]{.underline} so-called "[slaughterbots]{.underline}" [at a meeting in
Geneva last week]{.underline}, **[raising alarm bells]{.underline}**
among experts [**in artificial intelligence,** military strategy,
disarmament and humanitarian law]{.underline}. Slaughterbots are weapons
that select and apply force to targets without human intervention.
Instead, [they]{.underline} [make]{.underline} their [decisions with
artificial intelligence software]{.underline}, which is essentially a
series of algorithms. [For the first time ever]{.underline} this year,
[the bulk of the 125 nations]{.underline} that belong to the United
Nations' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) [said they
wanted new laws to be introduced on killer robots.]{.underline} However,
[some countries]{.underline} that are developing these weapons
[including the **U.S. and Russia**, were in **opposition, making a
unilateral agreement impossible**.]{.underline} The U.K. and several
other nations also objected. "We would have liked to have seen everyone
get behind that," Emilia Javorsky, a physician scientist who leads the
Future of Life Institute's advocacy program on autonomous weapons, told
CNBC. "[All it takes is one]{.underline}," she added. The conference
concluded Friday, with the group pledging to "intensify" discussions and
consider possible steps that are acceptable to all. [The fact that the
CCW failed to agree on anything concrete last week was hailed as an
"epic failure]{.underline}" by Javorsky. "[It is]{.underline} now
blatantly [clear **this forum**]{.underline} --- **[whose unanimity
requirement makes it easily derailed by any state with a vested
interest]{.underline}** --- **[is utterly incapable]{.underline}** of
taking seriously, let alone **[meaningfully addressing, the urgent
threats posed by emerging technologies such as artificial
intelligence]{.underline}**," she said. Verity Coyle, a senior advisor
at Amnesty International, said in a statement that the window of
opportunity to regulate killer robots grows ever smaller as research and
testing of these weapons presses forward. "[The CCW has once again
demonstrated its inability to make meaningful progress]{.underline} --
[it's]{.underline} now tim[e that committed states take the lead on an
external process]{.underline} that can deliver the type of breakthrough
we've previously seen on landmines and cluster munitions," she said.

### 2AC -- Solvency -- Biotech

#### UN biotech regulation wrecks developing countries widening the tech gap

**Miller, 96** (Henry I. Miller, Robert Wesson Fellow of scientific
philosophy & public policy, Hoover Institution Consulting Professor at
the Institute for International Studies at Stanford University,
7-1-1996, \"Biotechnology and the UN: New challenges, new failures,\"
Nature, <https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0796-831>, LASA-CSK)

[The **overregulation of technology**]{.underline}, [though damaging to
industrialized countries]{.underline}, **[is]{.underline}** particularly
**[devastating to developing countries]{.underline}** because **[it acts
as yet another]{.underline}**, and **[formidable entry barrier to
R&D]{.underline}**. Thus, the [UN\'s design\'s on biotechnology are
likely to increase further the income gap between the \"have\" and
\"have not\" nations]{.underline}, which more than doubled between 1960
and 1991. [Poorly crafted regulatory proposals constitute a lose-lose
proposition for the developing world]{.underline}. Virtually [every
field trial of every new biotechnology]{.underline} derived variant of
rice, cassava, maize, wheat, sweet potato, or other plant [would require
an environmental assessment]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} schemes
would [divert scarce resources to the regulation of activities
that]{.underline} are largely of negligible risk, [send inaccurate
messages about risk to the public and to politicians, and impose a
\"tax\" on innovation]{.underline} which is based on the excessively
regulated techniques. [These]{.underline} approaches [also make new
products artificially expensive to use, test, and produce]{.underline}:
New crop plant varieties must be adapted to local conditions and the
expense of testing them would become prohibitive. [Thus]{.underline},
unnecessary case by case 834 [review would diminish the degree and speed
of technology diffusion to the developing world]{.underline},
**[developing countries would be prevented from participating in
worldwide technological trends]{.underline}**, and [the technology gap
that already exists]{.underline} between the industrialized and
developing countries [would widen further]{.underline}. There are bitter
ironies in the demand that the developing world adopt unscientific,
technique-based and anti-innovative regulatory approaches. First, the
clamor usually originates from regulators or activists in industrialized
countries who both regard Third-world regulation as an opportunity to
validate their minority view of genetic engineering as manifesting
unique risks and see prospects for becoming players on a larger stage.
Second, [such policies]{.underline} preferentially [undermine research
on]{.underline} precisely the kinds of low-value-added but im[portant
products that are most needed in developing countries-]{.underline}
safer and more nutritious foods, improved bioremediation agents, and
alternatives to chemical pesticides and fertilizers. At the same time,
**[these poorly conceived policies exact a high cost]{.underline}**,
**[they are unlikely to afford any increment in environmental or public
health protection]{.underline}**

### 2AC -- Solvency -- Cyber

#### Perm solves -- UN fails without the US pushing for cyber norms

**Herman, 21** (Slate Herman, J.D. Candidate, University of Colorado Law
School, 1-29-2021, \"Cybersecurity and the U.N. Charter: A Square Peg in
a Round Hole,\" Colorado Technology Law Journal,
<https://ctlj.colorado.edu/?p=701>, LASA-CSK)

In this note I contend that [the U.N. Charter fails to adequately
address]{.underline} non-state actors or [provide effective alternatives
to armed conflict]{.underline}. The question of how to correctly
classify these actions under international law then arises. Article 51
of the U.N. Charter imbues nations with the power of self-defense
against an armed attack.\[20\] [The ancient concept of an armed attack
creates]{.underline} significant [ambiguity when applied to the
revolutionary concept of cyberwarfare]{.underline}. The use of armed
forces and other similar definitions are inadequate in their
understanding of cyberoperations**[. The U.N. Charter]{.underline}**
also **[fails to prescribe appropriate responses to
cyber-attacks]{.underline}** [and splits appropriate action into two
categories]{.underline}, [neither of which allow cyber]{.underline}
[operations to be classified correctly]{.underline}. Current
[international law does not adequately address]{.underline} [the growing
problem of cyberwarfare]{.underline}. [Specifically]{.underline}, the
[blind spots created by Articles 2(4), 41, 42, and 51]{.underline} of
the U.N. Charter in failing to address cyber warfare, coupled with lack
of responsibility for non-state actors expose the United States to
significant risk.\[21\] **[The United States must be active in pushing
the U.N. to consider new regulations to fix these potholes in the U.N.
Charter.]{.underline}** Though some governmental bodies seem unwilling
to join the discussion surrounding proper international cyberoperations,
others leap headlong into the murky topic. The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization ("[NATO]{.underline}") [has taken the largest step to
adequately define cyber operations and explain how international legal
regimes apply to cyberweapons]{.underline}.\[22\] In 2009, the NATO
Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence embarked on a journey to
produce a manual on the international law governing cyberwarfare, which
became known as the Tallinn Manual.\[23\] The project collected
distinguished practitioners and scholars in an attempt to project how
current legal standards would govern this new form of warfare. With its
primary focus on wartime action, the Tallinn Manual dives deeply into
cyber operations involving the use of force and those that occur in the
context of armed conflict.\[24\] In 2013, this text began serving as a
resource for governments and scholars in the legal field.\[25\] Almost
immediately after its publication, the group began work on a second
edition of the Tallinn Manual. Released in February 2017, Tallinn 2.0
expanded on the original version and added multiple provisions while
updating the original.\[26\] This manual serves as a background from
which I make many of my assumptions and conclusions.

#### Empirics prove China and Russia block all UN attempts at cyberspace international law

**Segal, 17** (Adam Segal, 6-29-2017, \"The Development of Cyber Norms
at the United Nations Ends in Deadlock. Now What?,\" Council on Foreign
Relations,
<https://www.cfr.org/blog/development-cyber-norms-united-nations-ends-deadlock-now-what>,
LASA-CSK)

[The **prospects of** developing **norms** of state behavior **in
cyberspace have been**]{.underline} looking positively
**[bleak]{.underline}** recently. The Lazarus Group, which appears to
have ties to North Korea, is suspected of being behind the WannaCry
ransomware attacks that spread to 150 countries and hobbled the UK's
National Health Service. Russian hackers have been named as the culprits
in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), and are
suspected of being responsible for blackouts in Kiev in 2015 and 2016.
This week's attack, Petya/NotPetyta, first looked like a new version of
ransomware, but now seems designed for disruption and destruction. The
attack appears to have originated in Ukraine, on the day before a
holiday marking the 1996 adoption of that country's first constitution,
so early suspicion is that Moscow is behind the attacks, though this is
still highly speculative (Russia itself has also suffered from Petya).
[Despite the proliferation of state-backed attacks]{.underline}, for a
brief window, [there did seem to be]{.underline} some [forward movement
on cyber norms.]{.underline} This week China and Canada agreed not to
conduct cyber espionage for commercial gain against each other. Beijing
has now signed similar agreements with the United States, United
Kingdom, Australia, and the G-7 and G-20. In 2013, a group of government
experts (GGE) at the UN agreed that international law, and especially
the UN Charter, applies to state activity cyberspace. In 2015, the same
group agreed to four peacetime norms promoted by the United States:
states should not interfere with each other's critical infrastructure;
they should not target each other's computer emergency response teams;
they should assist other nations investigating cyberattacks; and they
are responsible for actions that originate from their territory. [That
process seems to have reached a dead end]{.underline}. Last week,
Michelle Markoff, deputy coordinator for cyber issues in the State
Department published an explanation of the U.S. position at the end of
the 2016-2017 GGE process. Markoff's frustration is palpable, as she
writes the current "[report falls short of our mandate and doesn't meets
the standard that the previous GGEs have set for us.]{.underline}" The
sticking point is the application of international law.
[The]{.underline} [United States wanted to]{.underline} use the report
to begin [explain]{.underline}ing [exactly how international
law]{.underline} [applies in cyberspace]{.underline}, especially [in the
areas of]{.underline} the exercise of the inherent right of
[self-defense]{.underline} [and the law of state responsibility,
including countermeasures]{.underline}. [Other **participants
argued**]{.underline} that **[it was too early]{.underline}** in the
development of cyberspace **[to have such deliberations]{.underline}**,
**[and would]{.underline}** in themselves **[be
destabilizing]{.underline}**. They would be "incompatible with the
messages the Group should be sending regarding the peaceful settlement
of disputes and conflict prevention." Markoff does not call out the
[obstructionist states]{.underline} by name, but it is safe to assume
[China and Russia]{.underline} were among them. [Beijing has never liked
the idea that international law applies to cyberspace,]{.underline} [and
began walking back the 2013 report]{.underline} almost as soon as the
ink was dry. Chinese officials have consistently stressed the UN Charter
and the importance of sovereignty without mentioning the rest of
international law. During the 2015 meeting of the UN group,
[China]{.underline}'s representative [proposed taking out all references
to international law]{.underline} in the upcoming report. In the wake of
the DNC hack, M[oscow would certainly not support discussions about
countermeasures]{.underline}, which might cover U.S. reprisals for
hacking and information operations.

### 1AR -- Solvency -- AT UN Bad Links to Aff

#### NATO doesn't require UN oversight

**Perry , 98** (James T. Perry, 1-1-1998, \",\" Naval War College Press,
<https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1458&context=ils>,
LASA-CSK)

[Chapter VIII of the UN Charter]{.underline}13 [refers to]{.underline}
regional [organizations, such as NATO]{.underline}, [in t]{.underline}he
[context of appropriate]{.underline} regional [action in the maintenance
of international peace and security]{.underline}.14 It is in this area
that a relationship exists between the two organizations, with ultimate
authority centered in the United Nations. Excepting the area of
international peace and security, however, **[the relationship between
the UN and NATO is not hierarchical]{.underline}**. When the NATO
Charter was established in 1949 by the Treaty of Washington,15 it made
no mention of any relationship to the Security Council as a \"regional
arrangement,\" nor did it contain any provision providing for action
only upon the authorization of the Security Council, or for reporting
activities \"in contemplation.\" Instead, [the Treaty of Washington
expressed the]{.underline} [obligation of NATO\'s member states to be
that of \"collective self,defense]{.underline}\" under Article 51 of the
UN Charter and, correspondingly, embodied [only the obligation to report
\"measures]{.underline} [taken]{.underline}\" to the Security Council.16
[This formulation was adopted]{.underline} by the United States and its
NATO allies [because subordination of NATO actions as a regional
arrangement to Security Council review]{.underline} in advance [during
the Cold War would have subjected all actions to Soviet
veto]{.underline}. By **[characterizing NATO\'s military actions as
\"collective self,defense]{.underline}**\" under Article 51, [**there
would be no** action of a \"regional arrangement\" under Chapter VIII of
the UN Charter and no **prior Security Council review**.]{.underline}

## Theory

### 2AC -- International Fiat

#### International fiat is a [voter]{.underline}. Especially in this case since the aff fiats every major international actor. 

#### [Limits]{.underline} -- 195 countries multiplied by individual agencies makes in-depth engagement and predictability impossible.

#### [Aff ground]{.underline} -- the aff only gets to fiat the USFG cooperates with NATO, letting the neg fiat the 193 countries of the UN makes the topic impossible for the aff

#### Not [real world]{.underline} -- no policymaker can decide between two countries international organizations -- means no answers in the literature base.

### 2AC -- Multi-Actor Fiat

#### Multi-Actor fiat is a [voter]{.underline} -- 

#### [Fairness]{.underline} -- it fiats 193 of the 195 recognized countries -- that's functionally a fiat the whole world CP

#### [Education]{.underline} -- No lit base for Kosovo, Western Sahara, and Taiwan solvency deficits

Nations,\" No Publication, <https://www.csdr.org/95Book/Boothby.htm>,
LASA-CSK)

Personally, [I doubt]{.underline} very much that [the U.N. should ever
be in the business of **military peace enforcement**]{.underline}. [That
is a task that **should be carried out by fully effective military**
**organizations, such as NATO**]{.underline} or groups of states willing
to do and capable of doing the job. Such organizations should first be
given political license from the U.N. Security Council under Chapter
VII; the operations should be halted if that political license is
subsequently withdrawn. But **[the U.N.]{.underline}** itself **[has
neither the military command systems nor the political cohesion to carry
out military-enforcement tasks]{.underline}**. Moreover, it is arguable
that [a U.N. that carried out military peace
enforcemen]{.underline}t\--except perhaps in the most unique
circumstances\--[would find itself in much political
trouble]{.underline} with its members. In my view, [**Chapter VII** of
the U.N]{.underline}. Charter, as [an authority for U.N. peace
enforcement, was written for a different era and **has little military
application to today\'s world**.]{.underline}

#### The UN doesn't have the scientific expertise to be effective

**Juma, 2000** (Calestous Juma, Fall 2000, \"The UN\'s Role in the New
Diplomacy,\" Issues in Science and Technology,
<https://issues.org/stalk-4/>, LASA-CSK)

[As a new form of international diplomacy develops to deal
with]{.underline} a number of emerging issues in which [science and
technology]{.underline} play a central role[, the United Nations (UN)
risks being]{.underline} [relegated to the sidelines]{.underline}. [The
influence and effectiveness of diplomats]{.underline} and international
civil servants will increasingly de[pend on the extent to which they can
mobilize scientific and technical expertise]{.underline} in their work.
This need not require the UN to acquire extensive in-house scientific
competence, but the organization--especially the office of the secretary
general--must learn to tap advisory services to identify, mobilize, and
use the best available expertise. [Although]{.underline} a large number
of [UN agencies, programs, and treaties rely on scientific and
technological expertise]{.underline} for their work, t[hey are not
designed to receive systematic science advice as a key component of
effective performance]{.underline}. In most cases, science is used in
the UN to support special interests and political agendas that do not
necessarily advance the goals of the organization. But this should not
come as a surprise. The UN was founded and grew to prominence in the era
of the Cold War, when much of diplomacy was devoted to dealing with
threats arising from external aggression. Today, attention is turning to
issues such as infectious diseases, environmental degradation,
electronic crimes, weapons of mass destruction, and the impacts of new
technologies, which in the past would have been the concern of
individual nations but have now grown to international stature. The UN's
capacity to deal with these questions must also grow. What is notable
about the [UN]{.underline} is that it [includes organizations that cater
to a wide range of jurisdictions but not to]{.underline} the growing
community of [science advisors]{.underline}. **[Even]{.underline}**
agencies such as the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (**[UNESCO) have done little to provide a platform for the
world's science advisors]{.underline}**. Specialized agencies such as
UNESCO, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Health
Organization, and [the]{.underline} [UN]{.underline} Industrial
Development Organization relate to the UN secretary general's office
through a [bureaucratic hierarchy]{.underline} that [is not responsive
to timeliness]{.underline}. They are generally accountable to their
governing bodies and are heavily influenced by the interests of activist
[states. Even UN programs that deal with science-based issues such as
the environment have yet to place knowledge at the core of their
operations]{.underline}. [They have failed to take into account the
long-term implications of]{.underline} scientific advancement for their
[operations]{.underline}. Much of the attention in these programs is
devoted to territorial aggrandizement and not to the role of knowledge
in global governance. They are vestiges of Cold War institutional
structures.

#### [P5 veto powser means nothing gets done]{.underline}

**Koliward, 21** (Priya Koliwad, 10-06-2021, \"Is the United Nations
Still a Relevant International Body? --- The World Mind ,\" World Mind,
<https://www.theworldmind.org/home/2021/10/26/is-the-united-nations-still-a-relevant-international-body>,
LASA-CSK)

One of [the argument]{.underline}s [at the forefront in support for
eliminating the United Nations is that **the**]{.underline} most
powerful organ of the UN, the United Nations Security Council (**[UNSC),
is not relevant to the modern world.]{.underline}** The main evidence
for this claim is that the [UNSC only has five permanent member
states]{.underline}: USA, Russia, Britain, China, France) and 10
non-permanent member states. [This structure results in **misuse of veto
power**]{.underline}, often **[blocking key decisions]{.underline}**
that are [needed by nations with little to no
representation]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} also pre[vents developing
countries from being represented,]{.underline} which is necessary in the
present day.

Over the years, it has become clear that **[the Security Council's
permanent members have little interest in internal
reform.]{.underline}** Since this is the case, it is in the best
interest of the other UN member states to continue to push for reform.
With [powerful countries moving to unilateralism, populism, and
nationalism at the expense of multilateralism and collective
action]{.underline}, a united and forward-looking Security Council
capable of effectively driving the wider United Nations to achieve its
goals is essential.

### 2AC -- AT: RCA NB

#### Russia and China prevent Security Council effectiveness -- NATO avoids

**EL-Bawab, 4/26** (Nadine El-Bawab, 4-26-2022, \"UN Security Council\'s

LASA-CSK)

While experts said the U.N. facilitates diplomacy and keeps the lines of
communication open between major powers, [the Security Council\'s
actions are tied to major powers\' interests.]{.underline} [The inequity
of the Security Council is that **nothing can be done if it opposes what
the major powers want**]{.underline}, Poast said. While [the Security
Council has not been able to pass any resolutions regarding the war in
Ukraine]{.underline} [or act to stop or prevent it,]{.underline} Poast
said taking action is not part of its role. **[That is why NATO was
created]{.underline}**; **[to have a separate union, without China and
Russia]{.underline}**, **[allowing Western states to take
action]{.underline}**. \"One of the big things that drove the process of
creating NATO was the recognition sitting around late 1947 \[to\] 1948,
that, from the [British and the American]{.underline} perspective, they
weren\'t going to be able to work with the Soviet Union[,]{.underline}\"
Poast said, adding that the [powers needed a separate entity that would
enable them to take action]{.underline}. [Even in the early days of the
U.N]{.underline}., Poast said [there were concerns over]{.underline}
[whether]{.underline} the British, French and [Americans would be able
to work with the Soviets and Chinese.]{.underline} This was **[proven in
1999 when NATO took action in Kosovo, after the Security Council did not
act,]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} again in 2011 [when NATO
intervened in Libya]{.underline}. \"[It\']{.underline}s also [a key
reason why we\'re seeing NATO be very active in this war]{.underline},
because of exactly the fact that [the U.N. Security Council has been
