#### Afro-Pessimism fails to understand failure. Transformative revolutions can make new worlds through relational humanisms.

**Gordon 17** (Lewis R, Professor of Philosophy @ UConn, "Thoughts on
Afropessimism", Contemporary Political Theory, Volume 17, Issue, 1,
pages 105-137, December 7)

[I begin with]{.underline} this tale of philosophical abstraction to
contextualize [Afropessimism. Its main exemplars, such as Jared Sexton
and Frank Wilderson III]{.underline}, emerged from academic literary
theory, an area dominated by poststructuralism even in many cases that
avow ''Marxism.'' Sexton (2010) and Wilderson (2007) [divert from a
reductive poststructuralism]{.underline}, however, through examining
important existential moves inaugurated, as Daniel McNeil (2011, 2012)
observed, by Fanon and his intellectual heirs. The critical question
that Afropessimism addresses in this fusion is the viability of posed
strategies of Black liberation. (I'm using the capital ''B'' here to
point not only to the racial designation ''black'' but also to the
nationalist one ''Black.'' Afropessimists often mean both, since blacks
and Blacks have a central and centered role in their thought.) The world
that produced blacks and in consequence Blacks is, for Afropessimists, a
crushing, historical one whose Manichaean divide is sustained contraries
best kept segregated. Worse, any effort of mediation leads to confirmed
black subordination. Overcoming this requires purging the world of
antiblackness. Where cleansing the world is unachievable, an alternative
is to disarm the force of antiblack racism. Where whites lack power over
blacks, they lose relevance -- at least politically and at levels of
cultural and racial capital or hegemony. [Wilderson]{.underline} (2008),
for instance, [explores my concept of ''an antiblack world'' to build
similar arguments. Sexton]{.underline} (2011[) makes similar moves in
his discussions of ''social death.'']{.underline} As this forum doesn't
afford space for a long critique, I'll offer several, non-exhaustive
criticisms.

The first is that [[''an antiblack world'' is not]{.mark} identical with
[''the world is antiblack.'']{.mark}]{.underline} My argument is that
[such a world is an antiblack racist project. [It is not the historical
achievement. Its limitations emerge from a basic fact: Black
people]{.mark} and other opponents of such a project [fought, and
continue to fight]{.mark}]{.underline}, as we see today [in the
#BlackLivesMatter movement and many others, against it.]{.underline} The
same argument applies to the argument about social death. Such an
achievement would have rendered even these reflections stillborn. [[The
basic premises of]{.mark} the [Afropess]{.mark}imistic argument
[are]{.mark}, then, [locked in performative contradictions]{.mark}. Yet,
they have rhetorical force.]{.underline} This is evident through the
continued growth of its proponents and forums (such as this one) devoted
to it.

In Bad Faith and Antiblack Racism, I argued that there are forms of
antiblack racism offered under the guise of love, though I was writing
about whites who exoticize blacks while offering themselves as white
sources of black value. Analyzed in terms of bad faith, where one lies
to oneself in an attempt to flee displeasing truths for pleasing
falsehoods, exoticists romanticize blacks while affirming white
normativity, and thus themselves, as principals of reality. These
ironic, performative contradictions are features of all forms of racism,
where one group is elevated to godlike status and another is pushed
below that of human despite both claiming to be human.

Antiblack racism offers whites self-other relations (necessary for
ethics) with each other but not so for groups forced in a ''zone of
nonbeing'' below them. There is asymmetry where whites stand as others
who look downward to those who are not their others or their analogues.
[Antiblack racism is thus not a problem of blacks being ''others.'' It's
a problem of their not-being-analogical-selves-and-not-even
being-others. Fanon]{.underline}, in Black Skin, White Masks (1952),
[reminds us that Blacks among each other live in a world of selves and
others.]{.underline} It is in attempted relations with whites that these
problems occur. Reason in such contexts has a bad habit of walking out
when Blacks enter. What are Blacks to do? As reason cannot be forced,
because that would be ''violence,'' they must ironically reason
reasonably with forms of unreasonable reason. Contradictions loom.
[Racism is]{.underline}, given these arguments[, a project of imposing
non-relations as the model of dealing with people designated
''black.'']{.underline}

In Les Damne´ de la terre (''Damned of the Earth''), Fanon goes further
and argues that colonialism is an attempt to impose a Manichean
structure of contraries instead of a dialectical one of ongoing, human
negotiation of contradictions. The former segregates the groups; the
latter emerges from interaction. The police, he observes, are the
mediator in such a situation, as their role is force/violence instead of
the human, discursive one of politics and civility (Fanon, 1991). Such
societies draw legitimacy from Black non-existence or invisibility.
Black appearance, in other words, would be a violation of those systems.
Think of the continued blight of police, extra-judicial killings of
Blacks in those countries.

An immediate observation of many postcolonies is that antiblack
attitudes, practices, and institutions aren't exclusively white. Black
antiblack dispositions make this clear. Black antiblackness entails
Black exoticism. Where this exists, Blacks simultaneously receive Black
love alongside Black rejection of agency. Many problems follow. The
absence of agency bars maturation, which would reinforce the racial
logic of Blacks as in effect wards of whites. Without agency, ethics,
liberation, maturation, politics, and responsibility could not be
possible.

[Afropessimism faces the problem of a hidden premise of white agency
versus Black incapacity.]{.underline} Proponents of Afropessimism would
no doubt respond that the theory itself is a form of agency reminiscent
of Fanon's famous remark that though whites created le Ne\`gre it was
les Ne\`gres who created Ne´gritude. Whites clearly did not create
Afropessimism, which Black liberationists should celebrate. [[We should
avoid the fallacy]{.mark}, however, [of confusing source with
outcome]{.mark}. History is not short of bad ideas from good
people.]{.underline} If intrinsically good, however, each person of
African descent would become ethically and epistemologically a switching
of the Manichean contraries, which means only changing players instead
of the game.

We come, then, to the crux of the matter. [[If the goal of Afropessimism
is Afropessimism, its achievement would be]{.mark} attitudinal
and]{.underline}, in the language of old, stoic -- in short, [[a symptom
of antiblack society]{.underline}]{.mark}. At this point, there are
several observations that follow. The first is a diagnosis of the
implications of Afropessimism as symptom. The second examines the
epistemological implications of Afropessimism. The third is whether a
disposition counts as a political act and, if so, is it sufficient for
its avowed aims. There are more, but for the sake of brevity, I'll
simply focus on these.

An ironic dimension of pessimism is that it is the other side of
optimism. Oddly enough, both are connected to
[[nihilism]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is, as Nietzsche (1968) showed, a
decline of values during periods of social decay. [It [emerges when
people no longer want to be responsible]{.mark} for their actions.
Optimists expect intervention from beyond. [Pessimists declare relief is
not forthcoming.]{.mark}]{.underline} Neither takes responsibility for
what is valued. The valuing, however, is what leads to the second,
epistemic point. [[The presumption that what is at stake is what can be
known to determine what can be done is the problem.]{.underline}]{.mark}
If such knowledge were possible, the debate would be about who is
reading the evidence correctly. [[Such judgment would
be]{.underline}]{.mark} a priori -- that is, [[prior to events actually
unfolding. The future]{.mark}, unlike transcendental conditions such as
language, signs, and reality, is, however, ex post facto: It [is yet to
come]{.mark}.]{.underline} Facing the future, [[the question
is]{.mark}n't what will be or how do we know what will be but instead
[the realization that whatever is done will be that on which the future
will depend. Rejecting optimism and pessimism]{.mark}, there is a
supervening alternative: [political commitment.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The appeal to political commitment]{.underline} is not only in stream
with what French existentialists call l'intellectuel engage´ (committed
intellectual) but also [reaches back through the history and existential
situation of enslaved, racialized ancestors. Many were]{.underline}, in
truth[, an existential paradox: [commitment to action without
guarantees.]{.mark} The slave revolts, micro and macro acts of
resistance, escapes, and returns help others do the same; the cultivated
instability of plantations and other forms of enslavement, and countless
other actions, were waged against a gauntlet of forces designed to
eliminate any hope of success. [The claim of]{.mark} colonialists and
[enslavers was that the future]{.mark} [belonged to them]{.mark}, not to
the enslaved and the indigenous.]{.underline} A result of more than 500
years of conquest and 300 years of enslavement was also a (white)
rewriting of history in which African and First Nations' agency was, at
least at the level of scholarship, nearly erased. [[Yet]{.mark} [there
was resistance]{.mark} even in that realm, [as Africana and First
Nation]{.mark} intellectual history and [scholarship attest.]{.mark}
Such actions set the course for different kinds of struggle
today.]{.underline}

Such reflections occasion meditations on the concept of failure.
[Afropessimism]{.underline}, the existential critique suggests, [suffers
from a failure to understand failure.]{.underline}
[[Consider]{.underline}]{.mark} [Fanon's notion of [constructive
failure, where what doesn't]{.mark} initially [work]{.mark} [transforms
conditions for something new to emerge]{.mark}.]{.underline} To
understand this argument, [[one must rethink the philosophical
anthropology]{.underline}]{.mark} at the heart of a specific line [of
Euromodern thought [on what it means to be human. Atomistic and
individual substance]{.mark}]{.underline}- based, this model,
articulated by Hobbes, Locke, and many others, [[is of a non-relational
being that]{.mark} thinks, [acts]{.mark}, and moves along a course [in
which continued movement depends on not colliding with
others.]{.mark}]{.underline} Under that model, [the human]{.underline}
being is a thing that [enters a system that facilitates]{.underline} or
obstructs [its movement. [An alternative model]{.mark}]{.underline},
shared by many groups across southern Africa, [[is a relational version
of the human]{.underline}]{.mark} being as part of a larger system of
meaning. Actions, from that perspective, are [[not about]{.mark} whether
[''I'']{.mark} succeed [but]{.mark} instead about [''our'']{.mark}
story]{.underline} across time. As relational, it means that each human
being is [[a constant negotiation of ongoing efforts to build
relationships]{.mark} with others]{.underline}, which means no one
actually enters a situation without establishing new situations of
action and meaning. Instead of entering a game, their participation
requires a different kind of project -- especially where the ''game''
was premised on their exclusion. Thus, where the system or game repels
initial participation, such repulsion is [[a shift in the grammar of how
the system functions]{.mark}, especially its dependence on obsequious
subjects. Shifted energy [affords emergence of alternatives.]{.mark}
Kinds cannot be known before the actions that birthed them.]{.underline}

Abstract as this sounds[, it has much historical support.]{.underline}
Evelyn Simien (2016), in her insightful political study Historic Firsts,
examines the new set of relations established by Shirley Chisholm's and
Jesse Jackson's presidential campaigns. There could be no Barack Obama
without such important predecessors affecting the demographics of voter
participation. Simien intentionally focused on the most mainstream
example of political life to illustrate this point. [Although no
exemplar of radicalism, Obama's ''success'' emerged from Chisholm and
Jackson's]{.underline} (and many others') so-called
[''failure.'']{.underline} Beyond presidential electoral politics, there
are numerous examples of how prior, radical so-called ''failures''
transformed relationships that facilitated other kinds of outcome. The
trail goes back to [[the Haitian Revolution and back to every act of
resistance from]{.mark} Nat [Turner's Rebellion]{.mark} in the USA,
[Sharpe's in Jamaica, or Tula's in Curac¸ao and so many other efforts
for social transformation to come.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In existential terms, then, many ancestors of the African diaspora
embodied what Søren Kierkegaard (1983) calls an existential paradox. All
the evidence around them suggested failure and the futility of hope.
They first had to make a movement of infinite resignation -- that is,
resigning themselves to their situation. Yet they must simultaneously
act against that situation. Kierkegaard called this seemingly
contradictory phenomenon ''faith,'' but that concept relates more to a
relationship with a transcendent, absolute being, which could only be
established by a ''leap,'' as there are no mediations or bridge.
Ironically, if Afropessimism appeals to transcendent intervention, it
would collapse into faith. If, however, the argument rejects
transcendent intervention and focuses on committed political action, of
taking responsibility for a future that offers no guarantees, then the
movement from infinite resignation becomes existential political action.

At this point, the crucial meditation would be on politics and political
action. [An attitude of infinite resignation to the world without the
leap of committed action would simply be pessimistic or
nihilistic.]{.underline} Similarly, an attitude of hope or optimism
about the future would lack infinite resignation. We see here the
underlying failure of the two approaches. Yet ironically, [there is a
form of failure at failing in the pessimistic turn versus the optimistic
one, since [if focused exclusively on resignation as the goal,
then]{.mark} the ''act'' of [resignation would have been achieved,
which, paradoxically]{.mark}, would be a success; it [would be a
successful failing of failure]{.mark}.]{.underline} For politics to
emerge, however, there are two missing elements in inward pessimistic
resignation.

The first is that politics is a social phenomenon, which means it
requires the expanding options of a social world. Turning away from the
social world, though a statement about politics, is not, however, in and
of itself political. The ancients from whom much western political
theory or philosophy claimed affinity had a disparaging term for
individuals who resigned themselves from political life: idio¯te¯s, a
private person, one not concerned with public affairs, in a word -- an
idiot. I mention western political theory because that is the hegemonic
intellectual context of Afropessimism. We don't, however, have to end
our etymological journey in ancient Greek. Extending our linguistic
archaeology back a few thousand years, we could examine the Middle
Kingdom Egyptian word idi (deaf). The presumption, later taken on by the
ancient Athenians and Macedonians, was that a lack of hearing entailed
isolation, at least in terms of audio speech. The contemporary inward
resignation of seeking a form of purity from the loathsome historical
reality of racial oppression, in this reading, collapses ultimately into
a form of moralism (private, normative satisfaction) instead of public
responsibility born of and borne by action.

The second is the importance of power. Politics makes no sense without
it. But what is power? Eurocentric etymology points to the Latin word
potis as its source, from which came the word ''potent'' as in an
omnipotent god. If we again look back further, we will notice the Middle
Kingdom (2000 BCE--1700 BCE) KMT/ Egyptian word pHty, which refers to
godlike strength. Yet for those ancient Northeast Africans, even the
gods' abilities came from a source: In the Coffin Texts, HqAw or heka
activates the ka (sometimes translated as soul, spirit, or, in a word,
''magic''), which makes reality. All this amounts to a straightforward
thesis on power as the ability with the means to make things happen.

There is an alchemical quality to power. [The human world, premised on
symbolic communication, brings many forms of meaning into being, and
those new meanings afford relationships that build
institutions]{.underline} through a world of culture, a phenomenon that
Freud (1989) rightly described as ''a prosthetic god.'' It is godlike
because it addresses what humanity historically sought from the gods:
protection from the elements, physical maledictions, and social forms of
misery. Such power clearly can be abused. It is where those enabling
capacities (empowerment) are pushed to the wayside in the hording of
social resources into propping up some people as gods that the
legitimating practices of cultural cum political institution decline and
stimulate pessimism and nihilism. [That institutions in the Americas
very rarely attempt establishing positive relations to Blacks is the
subtext of Afropessimism]{.underline} and this entire meditation.

The discussion points, however, to a demand for political commitment.
Politics itself emerges under different names throughout the history of
our species, but the one occasioning the word ''politics'' is from the
Greek polis, which refers to ancient Hellenic city-states. It identifies
specific kinds of activities conducted inside the city-state, where
order necessitated the resolution of conflicts through rules of
discourse the violation of which could lead to (civil) war, a breaking
down of relations appropriate for ''outsiders.'' Returning to the
Fanonian observation of selves and others, it is clear that imposed
limitations on certain groups amounts to impeding or blocking the option
of politics. Yet, as a problem occurring within the polity, the problem
short of war becomes a political one.

Returning to Afropessimistic challenges, the question becomes this: If
the problem of antiblack racism is conceded as political, where
antiblack institutions of power have, as their project, the impeding of
Black power, which in effect requires barring Black access to political
institutions, then antiblack societies are ultimately threats also to
politics defined as the human negotiation of the expansion of human
capabilities or more to the point: freedom.

Anti-politics is one of the reasons why societies in which antiblack
racism is hegemonic are also those in which racial moralizing dominates:
moralizing stops at individuals at the expense of addressing
institutions the transformation of which would make immoral individuals
irrelevant. As a political problem, it demands a political solution. It
is not accidental that Blacks continue to be the continued exemplars of
unrealized freedom. As so many from Ida B. Wells-Barnett to Angela Davis
(2003) and Michelle Alexander (2010) have shown, [[the expansion of
privatization and incarceration is squarely placed in a structure of
states and civil societies premised on the limitations of
freedom]{.mark} (Blacks)]{.underline} -- ironically, as seen in
countries such as South Africa and the United States, [in the name of
freedom.]{.underline}

That power is a facilitating or enabling phenomenon, a functional
element of the human world, a viable response must be the establishing
of relations that reach beyond the singularity of the body. I bring this
up because proponents of [[Afropessimism]{.underline}]{.mark} might
object to this analysis because of its appeal to a human world. If that
world is abrogated, the site of struggle becomes that which is patently
not human. It is not accidental that popular race discourse refers today
to ''black bodies,'' for instance, instead of ''black people.'' [As the
human world is discursive, social, and relational, this [abandonment
amounts to an appeal to the non-relational, the incommunicability of
singularity, and appeals to the body and its reach.]{.mark}]{.underline}
At that point, it's perhaps the psychologist, psychiatrist, or
psychoanalyst who would be helpful, as turning radically inward offers
the promise of despair, narcissistic delusions of godliness, and, as
Fanon also observed, madness. Even if that slippery slope were rejected,
the performative contradiction of attempting to communicate such
singularity or absence thereof requires, at least for consistency, the
appropriate course of action: silence.

#### **Ontology is contradictory, self-aggrandizing, and devolves into anti-political moralizing -- it ignores institutional engagement which is a better way to engage anti-black racism.**

would be a success; it would be a successful failing of failure. **[For

resignation to consider.]{.underline}**

The first is that [[politics]{.mark} is a social phenomenon, which means
it [requires]{.mark} the [expanding options of a social

from the social world, though a statement about politics, is not in and
of itself political. As we have seen, the ancients from whom much
Western political theory or philosophy claimed affinity had a
disparaging term for an individual resigned from political
life---namely, idiōtēs, a private person, one not concerned with public
affairs, in English: an idiot. I mention "Western political theory"
because that is the hegemonic intellectual context of Afropessimism; I
have not come across Afropessimistic writings on thought outside of that
framework. We do not have to end our etymological journey in ancient
Greek. Recall that extending our linguistic archaeology back a few
thousand years we could examine the Middle Kingdom (2000 BCE--1700 BCE)
of Kmt's Mdw Ntr word idi (deaf). The presumption, later taken on by the
ancient Athenians and other Greek-speaking peoples, was that a lack of
hearing entailed isolation, at least in terms of audio speech. [The
contemporary inward [resignation of seeking]{.mark} a form of
[purity]{.mark} from]{.underline} the loathsome historical reality of
[racial oppression]{.underline}, in this reading,
[[retreats]{.mark}]{.underline} ultimately [[into]{.mark} a form of
[moralism]{.mark}]{.underline} (private, normative satisfaction) instead
of public responsibility born of and borne by action. The nonbeing to
which Afropessimists refer is also a form of inaudibility.

[The second is]{.underline} the importance of [power.]{.underline}
Politics makes no sense without it. As we have seen throughout our
earlier reflections on power, Eurocentric etymology points to the Latin

very rarely attempt to establish positive relations to blacks, and

**[It is a question for which]{.underline}**, in both existential and
political terms, **[I do not see how an answer could be given from an

thinkers should not do their work in predominantly white spaces. It is
simply that **[the argument of the impossibility of their doing so makes
their location in such places patently contradictory.]{.underline}** We
are at this point on familiar terrain. **[As with ancient logical

the best option]{.underline}**, after a moment of immobilized
reflection, **[is,]{.underline}** eventually, **[to move
on]{.underline}**, even where the pause is itself significant as an
encomium of thought.

#### Social death theory is wrong\-\--conflates the oppressors' view with the truth of black of existence, which re-centers the slave owner's perspective and prevents struggles for re-humanization

the Black Radical Tradition?" in Futures of Black Radicalism, ed. by
Johnson and Lubin, 2017. p. 108-110.

Three miracles seem to characterize the history of Black people in the
United States. The very survival of Black people in the face of
murderous brutality and genocidal intent qualifies as a miracle. [The
enduring reality of Black humanity in a society that has used every
means at its disposal to]{.underline} destroy Black dignity and [deny
Black people]{.underline} the opportunity to exercise [their full
humanity appears miraculous. The historical record of democratic
aspiration and achievement by Black people, of creating]{.underline}
democratic [opportunities for themselves and extending them to others,
seems to defy normal rational explanations.
[Despite]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[social death]{.mark} at the center
of the slave system and]{.underline} the [organized abandonments
of]{.underline} today\'s [neoliberal capitalism, despite beatings,
lynchings, shootings, mass incarceration and systematic impoverishment,
[Black people]{.mark} have [survived]{.mark}]{.underline} and thrived.

they]{.underline} somehow [managed to survive, [to extend
recognition]{.mark}]{.underline} and respect [to each other while in
bondage, [and]{.mark} to [maintain a commitment to the **linked fate**
of all humans]{.mark}. Time and time again, Black people have
[**countered** vicious dehumanization with]{.mark} determined and
[**successful re-humanization**. Insisting on **their own humanity**
and]{.mark} the humanity [of **all people**]{.mark}, even that of their
oppressors, they have been at the forefront of]{.underline} what Dr.
King called ["the bitter but beautiful struggle" for a more just and
better world. [From]{.mark} the egalitarian politics of [abolition
democracy]{.mark} in the wake of the Civil War and the participatory
democracy of the [civil rights]{.mark} movement to the contemporary
insurgencies waged under]{.underline} the banners of
[\#[B]{.mark}lack[L]{.mark}ives[M]{.mark}atter [and]{.mark}
\#[SayHerName]{.mark}, struggles for]{.underline} Black survival and
[[Black humanity]{.mark} have]{.underline} repeatedly [[linked the
termination of]{.mark} existing [racist policies to the creation of new
democratic **practices and institutions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Forced
to cope with the nadir of political evil over centuries, Black people
have responded consistently by forging advanced concepts of a deeply
politicized love. Perhaps precisely because brutality and oppression can
make people decidedly unlovable, [African people in America have been
adept at finding ways to perceive something left to love inside
themselves and in others. [That]{.mark} ability has
[enabled]{.mark}]{.underline} their survival, [the [preservation of
their humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}, and their emergence as the
nation\'s foremost champions of democracy and social justice. The people
who were systematically denied access to the fruits and benefits of
democratic citizenship and social membership turned out to be the people
who valued democracy the most and who did the most to extend it to
others. \[END PAGE 108\] Cedric Robinson has demonstrated that the three
miracles were not really miracles at all, but rather products of a
collective intelligence developed over generations of struggle. In Black
Marxism, Robinson defines the Black Radical Tradition as "the continuing
development of a collective consciousness informed by the historical
struggles for liberation and motivated by the shared sense of obligation
to preserve the collective being, the ontological totality."1 Thus in
many ways, the greatest achievement of the Black community was itself,
its emergence as an aggrieved and insurgent polity committed to social
justice. [The "Black" in the Black Radical Tradition is a politics
rather than a pigment, a culture rather than a color]{.underline}. Yet
[this Blackness **does not presume** a unified homogenous community with
only one set of interests, needs, and desires]{.underline}. On the
contrary, Robinson\'s research reveals that [the key building blocks for
Black survival, Black humanity, and Black democracy came from the lower
rungs of Black society, from the plantations and slave quarters, out of
the contradictions of the rural regimes of slavery and debt peonage and
the living conditions in ghettos of northern and western cities.
Experience taught the Black poor and the Black working class that racial
capitalism entailed "an unacceptable standard of human
conduct"]{.underline}2 [that they needed to counter with a politics that
was]{.underline} "inventive rather than imitative, [communitarian rather
than individualistic, democratic rather than republican]{.underline},
Afro-Christian rather than secular and materialist."3 [Robinson\'s
[emphasis on political struggle]{.mark} as the main explanation for
Black]{.underline} survival, [humanity]{.underline}, and democracy
[[reminds us **not to confuse** the]{.mark} grandiose [**aspirations and
illusions** of the powerful with]{.mark} the **[actual lived
experiences]{.mark}** of those they control. [Slavery did
mandate]{.mark} legally and militarily supported [social death, but
slaves worked]{.mark} assiduously and effectively each day, every day,
each year, and every year [to create]{.mark} a **[rich social
life]{.mark}**]{.underline}.4 As Robinson argues, ["Slavery gave the lie
to its own conceit: one could not create a perfect system of oppression
and exploitation."]{.underline}5 [[Domination produces resistance,
and]{.mark} resistance [plants the]{.mark} seeds of a [new]{.mark}
society **[within]{.mark} the shell** of [the old]{.mark}]{.underline}.
As Robinson explains in Black Movements in America, \"The resistances to
slavery were the \[END PAGE 109\] principal grounds for the radically
alternative political culture that coalesced in the Black communities of
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the era of revolutionary,
liberal and nationalist impulses among Europeans in North America." 6
[[Declaring Blacks to be less than human **could not make them
so**]{.mark}, even in the eyes of their oppressors.
Research]{.underline} by John Blassingame, George Rawick, Sterling
Stuckey, Herbert Gutman, and Stephanie Camp (among others) [reveals how
[slaves fused African]{.mark} retention [and New World]{.mark} invention

humanity of others]{.underline}.7 [They [recognized]{.mark}]{.underline}
this [[common humanity through]{.mark} multicultural, [multiracial

[reached out to Native Americans]{.mark} for help in [resisting

[were less successful in preserving their own humanity]{.underline}. In
order [to maintain the illusion of complete control, they tortured,
whipped, hanged, burned, and dismembered their \"property\" when it
displayed signs of having human will]{.underline}.10 [Black people
witnessed white people\'s inhumanity and pitied them. As early as the
1820s]{.underline}, David [Walker argued that while whites lost the
moral capacity to perceive the evil they enacted, they nonetheless knew
\"in their hearts\" that Blacks were human]{.underline}. He argued that
it was precisely this recognition that propelled their cruelty and
brutality: they presumed that Blacks resented them and, if given the
opportunity, would do to whites what whites had done to Blacks.11 [In
his history of the New Orleans slave market]{.underline}, Walter
[Johnson notes a similar loss of humanity among slave owners.
Whites]{.underline} invested more than money in the slave system; they
[looked to]{.underline} it to [elevate]{.underline} them [beyond the
status of ordinary mortals and became outraged when their chattel
refused to conform to the roles they had been assigned]{.underline}.
Johnson notes: The greater the transformative hopes slaveholders took
with them to the slave market, the more violent their reactions to the
inevitable disappointment of their efforts to get real slaves to act
like imagined ones \... If they had to, they would use brutality to
close the distance between the roles they imagined for themselves and
the failings of the slaves they bought as props for their performance.

[Liza Bramlett was a slave. She lived on a cotton plantation
in]{.underline} the [Mississippi]{.underline} Delta during the
nineteenth century. White men raped her repeatedly throughout her life.
They traded her body amongst themselves in exchange for calves and
piglets. In the end, Liza gave birth to twenty-three children, twenty of
whom were conceived by rape. [One of Liza's daughters, Ella Townsend,
was born after emancipation]{.underline}, but remained in the bondage of
sharecropping in rural Mississippi. As an adult, she carried a pistol
with her in the fields, determined to protect herself and the
surrounding children. One day, a white man on horseback rode into the
fields. He had come to abduct a young black girl. Ella, carrying her
pistol in a lunch pail, intervened. "You don't have no black children
and you're not going to beat no black children," she told the intruder.
"If you step down off that horse, I'll go to Hell and back with you
before Hell can scorch a feather." "[I do not believe that we can stop
them ... because they must ultimately stop themselves]{.underline},"
Ta-Nehisi [Coates says of white racists]{.underline} in the final
paragraph of his bestseller Between the World and Me, written as an open
letter to his son. [[Coates describes racism as]{.underline}]{.mark}
galactic, [[a physical law]{.mark} of the universe]{.underline}, "a
tenacious gravity" and a "cosmic injustice." [When a cop kills a black
man, the police officer is "a force of nature]{.underline}, the helpless
agent of our world's physical laws." Society is equally helpless against
the natural order. "The earthquake cannot be subpoenaed," says Coates.
In a widely replicated gesture, Coates locates the experience of racism
in the body, in a racism that "dislodges brains, blocks airways, rips
muscle, extracts organs, cracks bones, breaks teeth." In the slim
volume, fewer than two hundred pages, the word "body" or "bodies"
appears more than three hundred times. "In America," he writes, "it is
traditional to destroy the black body." Another brooding passage dwells
on the inevitability of this violence. It had to be blood. It had to be
nails driven through a tongue and ears pruned away. It had to be the
thrashing of a kitchen maid for the crime of churning the butter at a
leisurely clip. It could only be the employment of carriage whips,
tongs, iron pokers, handsaws, stones, paperweights or whatever might be
handy to break the black body. Yet [[Coates's descriptive
language]{.mark} and haunting narrative are not mere
metaphors]{.underline}. [They [act as a]{.mark}]{.underline} kind of
[**[ontological pivot]{.underline}**, [mystifying
racism]{.underline}]{.mark} [even as it is anchored in its physical
effects]{.underline}. **[Metaphor]{.underline}** [has long been used to
capture racism's]{.underline} almost **[unimaginable
brutality]{.underline}**. Lynching became "strange fruit" in Abel
Meerpool's song, made famous by Billie Holiday. In a wry, tragic
innuendo, rape was referred to in Black communities as "nighttime
integration." The use of metaphor is not in itself an obfuscation. But
Coates wields metaphor to obscure rather than illuminate the reality of
racism. [What we find all too often in Coates's narrative universe are
bodies without life and a racism without people]{.underline}. **[[To
give race]{.mark} an [ontological meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}**, to
make it a reality all its own, **[[is to drain]{.mark} it of
[its]{.mark} place in [history and]{.mark} its [roots in discrete human
action]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[To deny the]{.mark} role of [life and
people --- of politics]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- as Coates does **[[is
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[foreclose]{.mark} the possibility of
[liberation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** No Helpless Agent [Ella knew her
mother Liza's unimaginable suffering]{.underline}, but her memory was
not a yoke on her shoulders. It provoked something in Ella. As an adult,
she did not see the white predator stalking the fields as some helpless
agent. She took matters into her own hands. There was no gravity strong
enough to break her will or loosen her grip on her pistol. Her efforts
rippled beyond those cotton fields. [Ella taught her own daughter,
Fannie Lou Hamer, not only to struggle, but to resist]{.underline}.
[**[Fannie Lou]{.mark}** was born into a sharecropping family in rural
Mississippi but [would go on to become a beacon of]{.mark} the [Civil
Rights]{.mark} movement.]{.underline} [[She is]{.mark} best [known
for]{.mark}]{.underline} her work [[registering black voters]{.mark} in
Mississippi]{.underline}, most famously during 1964's Freedom Summer, at
great personal risk. [Police arrested and beat her. White racists shot
at her. Lyndon Johnson dismissed her as an illiterate]{.underline}. In
1973, [an interviewer asked her, "[Do you have faith]{.mark} that [the
system will ever work properly]{.mark}]{.underline}?" By then, Fannie
Lou had seen a decade of setbacks and false dawns since first walking
off her plantation in 1962 to fight for Civil Rights. [[She
responded]{.underline}, **[We have to make it
work]{.underline}**]{.mark}[. Ain't nothing going to be handed to you on
a silver platter. That's not just black people, that's people in
general, masses. See, I'm with the masses... You've got to fight. Every
step of the way you've got to fight]{.underline}**.** [She marched. She
sang freedom songs. She testified. [She co-founded the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party. For her, **the logical solution was
political**]{.mark}**: uniting a powerless many against a powerful
few.**]{.underline} [White **[racists could be
stopped.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[Black people **could
resist**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and Fannie Lou and so many others did
just that. Fannie Lou knew that the wages of racism were measured on the
body. "A black woman's body was never hers alone," she once remarked.
[White doctors sterilized her without her consent]{.underline} during a
minor surgery, a barbaric intrusion so common she called it a
"Mississippi appendectomy." [However, though she knew racism's physical
toll, she drew inspiration from stories of black resistance passed down
orally across the generations]{.underline}. Hamer recalled her
grandmother's will to survive and her mother's weapon of protection.
These intergenerational resistance narratives, according to Charles Cobb
in his book This Nonviolent Stuff'll Get You Killed, "underlay a deep
and powerful collective memory that was invisible to whites but greatly
affected the shape and course of the modern Freedom Movement." As a
result, [[Fannie Lou and]{.mark} so many [others possessed]{.mark} an
intimate [knowledge]{.mark} not only [of **their own human dignity,
despite**]{.mark} **the racist [brutality]{.mark}** they endured, but
also of the human frailty of their racial oppressors]{.underline}. [In
the years before Fannie Lou's political struggle began, whole
communities, black women and men, rose up against the violence that was
forced on black women's bodies]{.underline}. Feminist historian Danielle
McGuire argues this anti-rape community organizing in Alabama laid the
foundation for what eventually became the Montgomery Bus Boycott. She
observes, "The majority of leaders active in the Montgomery Improvement
Association in 1955 cut their political teeth demanding justice for
black women who were raped in the 1940s and early 1950s." [[Despite
being a poor, black sharecropper **drowning in**]{.mark} **the [poverty
and racial terror]{.mark}**]{.underline} endemic to rural Mississippi,
Fannie Lou held fast to her forbearers' stories of resistance. **[[She
did not resign]{.mark} herself [to fatalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as
Coates does. The \"Birthmark of Damnation\" Coates too takes a
multigenerational view. Between the World and Me is framed as a letter
to his son. However, rather than seeing a legacy of resistance, he finds
a lineage of blackness defined by fear and dysfunction. "When I was your
age the only people I knew were black, and all of them were powerfully,
adamantly, dangerously afraid," he writes. "I felt the fear in the
visits to my Nana's home in Philadelphia," Coates continues. "And I saw
it in my own father." My father was so very afraid. I felt it in the
sting of his black leather belt, which he applied with more anxiety than
anger, my father who beat me as if someone might steal me away, because
that is exactly what was happening all around us. Coates describes his
condition, and that of all black people, as a "birthmark of damnation."
The resistance stories passed down to Fannie Lou and so many others
spurred them to march. Coates's narrative, riddled with fear and
futility, begs us to retreat. [[Though]{.mark} Coates has [never
explicitly cited]{.mark} it as [his]{.mark} theoretical
[framework]{.mark}, the dour outlook of his work [evokes]{.mark} the
themes of **[Afro-Pessimism]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [The pivot to the
ontological]{.underline}]{.mark} that is apparent in Coates's rhetoric
[[is]{.mark} a [hallmark]{.mark} of Afro-Pessimism]{.underline}.
"[Ontology by definition is the study of being, and [to speak of
Blackness as]{.mark} an [ontological]{.mark} condition [means
analyzing]{.mark} the state of [Black bodies through]{.mark} the lens of
[slavery]{.mark}]{.underline}," Afro-Pessimist scholar Michael Barlow,
Jr., writes in the academic journal Inquiries. However, for Barlow,
[[the relation of slavery that ontologically defines blackness
is]{.mark} not a matter of political economy, but rather **a
"[libidinal]{.mark} economy."** In this telling]{.underline}, labor and
ownership --- that is, political economy --- are merely incidental to
racial slavery. Instead, [it's [the white imagination and its]{.mark}
depraved "metaphysical [desires for Black flesh]{.mark}" that both
predated and catalyzed racialized chattel slavery. **[Racism is reduced
to the spiritual]{.mark}, [more]{.mark} a matter of a [sin]{.mark}ful
nature [than]{.mark} a [political struggle]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Coates has echoed this retreat to interiority, to the spiritual, to
consciousness]{.underline}. **[[It's the ontological pivot that
leads]{.underline}]{.mark}** Frank **[[Wilderson]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
perhaps the world's foremost Afro-Pessimist, **[[to
declare]{.underline}]{.mark}** in his foundational text "Gramsci's Black
Marx: Whither the Slave in Civil Society?" **[that [black people are no
more than cows in a slaughterhouse]{.mark}. Wilderson posits that "death
of the black body is foundational to the life of American civil
society," just as a cow's death is essential to the
slaughterhouse.]{.underline}** Flippantly, Wilderson asks, "how would
the cows fare under a dictatorship of the proletariat?" Coates adopts a
similar sense of impotence. He characterizes struggle as aimless toil
--- an apolitical end in itself. "The struggle is really all I have for
you," he tells his son, "because it is the only portion of this world
under your control." Yet how are we to struggle against earthquakes and
physical laws? How can we fight gravity? Both Coates and Wilderson speak
of power in terms of dreams. Coates writes of monolithic white
"Dreamers," those whose investment in the American Dream requires a
faith in their own whiteness. Similarly, Wilderson sees America as
enacting two distinct dreams. For Wilderson, "the dream of black
accumulation and death" is separate from "the dream of worker
exploitation." Ultimately, [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} both Coates's and
[[Wilderson's]{.underline}]{.mark} respective
[[framework]{.underline}s]{.mark}, **[[solidarity is
unimaginable]{.underline}]{.mark}** and class struggle is rendered
futile. Though Coates does not go to the lengths Wilderson does to
position himself in opposition to materialist politics, the result is
effectively equivalent: a separation of race and class combined with a
deep skepticism of class-based solidarity, reforms, or even revolution.
This is a turn away from the Freedom Tradition embodied by Fannie Lou
Hamer. For her, the problem of racism wasn't cosmology or ontology ---
it was an expression of politics implicated in class antagonism. Fannie
Lou Hamer stood "with the masses," both white and black. Solidarity
through struggle from below, including class struggle, formed her path
to victory. Coates's ontological pivot is more muddled than Wilderson's.
Fleetingly peppered throughout his work are allusions to material
reality, betraying the imposition of metaphysical abstraction that
ultimately drives his perspective. "We did not choose our fences," he
writes. "They were imposed on us by Virginia planters obsessed with
enslaving as many Americans as possible." Coates knows that Virginia
planters did not invent gravity or earthquakes. Yet this historicizing
impulse does not prevent him from essentializing racism when he
confronts it head on. In string of tweets from December 2016, Coates
conceded that racism is not transcendental, noting that "at its very
root it was always economic." But acknowledging racism's economic impact
has not led him to embrace class struggle. Even Frank Wilderson can
acknowledge that racism has an economic impact, but he still believes
that class struggle and racism exist on distinct planes. Coates holds a
similar belief; that racism is wholly different in kind from class. In
the same series of tweets, he concluded that "in America, 'class' isn't
the only kind of class." [Just as he mystifies racism, even while
locating its impact in the bodies of black people, here he again pivots.
[Coates cannot address material politics]{.mark} on its own terms,
[preferring]{.mark} instead [to retreat to]{.mark} a [contrived
mystification]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**He replaces action with
interiority.** As he recently told an auditorium of eager Northwestern
students, "The process should not be... people looking out at the world
and saying, 'I would like for there to be change in the world, how do I
do that?'" Instead, he implored the crowd to engage from the
"inside-out, not outside-in... because if you are in the business of
justice, and making this society more democratic, you might get a lot of
disappointment."]{.underline} Consciousness matters, of course. "Baby
you just got to love 'em," Fannie Lou Hamer would say of the white
segregationists who routinely threatened her life. "Hating just makes
you sick and weak." This was Hamer in a reflexive moment, but it was no
retreat. In the very next breath, she warned, "I keep a shotgun in every
corner of my bedroom and the first cracker even look like he wants to
throw some dynamite on my porch won't write his mama again." Fannie Lou
truly was her mother's daughter. Reflection, whether through
intergenerational story or her own thoughts, enhanced her resistance.
The same cannot be said of Coates. [[Instead of]{.mark} finding relief
in [political action, Coates]{.mark} finds it in a cookout at Howard
University's homecoming, surrounded by black people]{.underline}. [He
[fantasizes]{.mark} that he is "disappearing into all of their bodies,"
as the **[music and dancing]{.mark}**, the black cultural zeitgeist of
the moment, [cure him of the "birthmark of
damnation."]{.mark}]{.underline} [The curse is lifted. Blackness is
transfigured, becoming a space "beyond the Dream." [It's another
**ontological pivot**]{.mark}, this time [allowing Coates to
conclude]{.mark} that The Mecca's" --- his term for Howard ---
[**cookout** has a "power more gorgeous than a]{.mark}ny **[voting
rights bill]{.mark}**." **[It's a fantasy of
retreat]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as if black culture were beyond the
machinations of capitalism, as though black cultural expression existed
in the world but was not of it and were enough to take us to a new one.
Between the World and Me concludes with Coates considering climate
change. He sees climate change as a manifestation of a polluted white
consciousness, rather than the unfettered excess of industrial
capitalism. It is a "noose around the neck of the earth," allegedly
resulting in large part from white flight, the mid-century exodus of
negrophobic white families to the suburbs and the pollution caused by
the cars that took them there. [[Coates's words]{.mark} here [are
**poetic but grossly inaccurate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[They mimic
Afro-Pessimism's emphasis on]{.mark} the white [libido]{.mark},
[relegating]{.mark} his [rhetoric to the]{.mark} realm of interior life,
the [**souls of white folks**, and stopping]{.mark} well **[short of the
political]{.mark}** domain]{.underline}. For Coates, the Civil Rights
movement was not a struggle to alter a material world; rather the "hope
of the movement" was merely to "awaken the Dreamers." Black politics is
only relevant as far as it can arouse white consciousness, which he sees
as a largely futile exercise, due to "the small chance of the Dreamers
coming into consciousness." Coates sees common interest between the
black elite and the black poor, as he marvels at "the entire diaspora,"
from lawyers to street hustlers, present at Howard's homecoming. Yet he
cannot conceive of anti-capitalist class solidarity across racial
identity. He has a darker vision, of a kind that Corey Robin has
described as "apocalypticism." Coates's ultimate hope is not in
collective human action, but rather the total annihilation of the world
and all those living in it--- another feature that unites him with
Afro-Pessimism, which calls explicitly for the "end of the world." As he
says of the Dreamers, "the field for their Dream, the stage where they
have painted themselves white, is the deathbed of us all."
Paradoxically, though he can see a collective fate in apocalypse, he
rejects shared struggle for liberation. "The Dreamers will have to learn
to struggle themselves," he declares. The problem is, the whole of
capitalist enterprise, both past and present, cannot be reduced to race
as Original Sin. Left out of Coates's mythology is the fact that
colonial enterprise, in what would become the United States, relied
first on European indentured servants, most of whom died within a
handful of years after arriving on the continent. [[It's Coates's
reading]{.mark} of race as sin [that pushes him to imagine a
**perverted**]{.mark} **form of [salvation in the]{.mark} fantasy of
[apocalypse]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In this racial fatalism,
reparations for slavery emerges as the anticipation of the inevitable
Judgement Day]{.underline}. It is therefore no surprise that Coates has
taken up racial reparations as his cross to bear --- not to change the
world, but to condemn it.

#### Their [ontological]{.underline} and [libidinal]{.underline} readings of blackness are [inaccurate]{.underline} and [undermine liberation]{.underline}\-\--a history of black resistance [disproves]{.underline} the [rigidity]{.underline} of it as a metaphysical category.

Ta-Nehisi [Coates says of white racists]{.underline} in the final
paragraph of his bestseller Between the World and Me, written as an open
letter to his son. [[Coates describes racism as]{.underline}]{.mark}
galactic, [[a physical law]{.mark} of the universe]{.underline}, "a
tenacious gravity" and a "cosmic injustice." [When a cop kills a black
man, the police officer is "a force of nature]{.underline}, the helpless
agent of our world's physical laws." Society is equally helpless against
the natural order. "The earthquake cannot be subpoenaed," says Coates.
In a widely replicated gesture, Coates locates the experience of racism
in the body, in a racism that "dislodges brains, blocks airways, rips
muscle, extracts organs, cracks bones, breaks teeth." In the slim
volume, fewer than two hundred pages, the word "body" or "bodies"
appears more than three hundred times. "In America," he writes, "it is
traditional to destroy the black body." Another brooding passage dwells
on the inevitability of this violence. It had to be blood. It had to be
nails driven through a tongue and ears pruned away. It had to be the
thrashing of a kitchen maid for the crime of churning the butter at a
leisurely clip. It could only be the employment of carriage whips,
tongs, iron pokers, handsaws, stones, paperweights or whatever might be
handy to break the black body. Yet [[Coates's descriptive

Coates wields metaphor to obscure rather than illuminate the reality of

enough to break her will or loosen her grip on her pistol. Her efforts
rippled beyond those cotton fields. [Ella taught her own daughter,

for]{.mark}]{.underline} her work [[registering black voters]{.mark} in
Mississippi]{.underline}, most famously during 1964's Freedom Summer, at
great personal risk. [Police arrested and beat her. White racists shot
at her. Lyndon Johnson dismissed her as an illiterate]{.underline}. In
1973, [an interviewer asked her, "[Do you have faith]{.mark} that [the
system will ever work properly]{.mark}]{.underline}?" By then, Fannie
Lou had seen a decade of setbacks and false dawns since first walking
off her plantation in 1962 to fight for Civil Rights. [[She
responded]{.underline}, **[We have to make it
work]{.underline}**]{.mark}[. Ain't nothing going to be handed to you on
a silver platter. That's not just black people, that's people in
general, masses. See, I'm with the masses... You've got to fight. Every
step of the way you've got to fight]{.underline}**.** [She marched. She
sang freedom songs. She testified. [She co-founded the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party. For her, **the logical solution was
political**]{.mark}**: uniting a powerless many against a powerful
few.**]{.underline} [White **[racists could be
stopped.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[Black people **could
resist**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and Fannie Lou and so many others did
just that. Fannie Lou knew that the wages of racism were measured on the
body. "A black woman's body was never hers alone," she once remarked.
[White doctors sterilized her without her consent]{.underline} during a
minor surgery, a barbaric intrusion so common she called it a
"Mississippi appendectomy." [However, though she knew racism's physical
toll, she drew inspiration from stories of black resistance passed down
orally across the generations]{.underline}. Hamer recalled her
grandmother's will to survive and her mother's weapon of protection.
These intergenerational resistance narratives, according to Charles Cobb
in his book This Nonviolent Stuff'll Get You Killed, "underlay a deep
and powerful collective memory that was invisible to whites but greatly
affected the shape and course of the modern Freedom Movement." As a
result, [[Fannie Lou and]{.mark} so many [others possessed]{.mark} an
intimate [knowledge]{.mark} not only [of **their own human dignity,
despite**]{.mark} **the racist [brutality]{.mark}** they endured, but
also of the human frailty of their racial oppressors]{.underline}. [In
the years before Fannie Lou's political struggle began, whole
communities, black women and men, rose up against the violence that was
forced on black women's bodies]{.underline}. Feminist historian Danielle
McGuire argues this anti-rape community organizing in Alabama laid the
foundation for what eventually became the Montgomery Bus Boycott. She
observes, "The majority of leaders active in the Montgomery Improvement
Association in 1955 cut their political teeth demanding justice for
black women who were raped in the 1940s and early 1950s." [[Despite
being a poor, black sharecropper **drowning in**]{.mark} **the [poverty
and racial terror]{.mark}**]{.underline} endemic to rural Mississippi,
Fannie Lou held fast to her forbearers' stories of resistance. **[[She
did not resign]{.mark} herself [to fatalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as
Coates does. The \"Birthmark of Damnation\" Coates too takes a
multigenerational view. Between the World and Me is framed as a letter
to his son. However, rather than seeing a legacy of resistance, he finds
a lineage of blackness defined by fear and dysfunction. "When I was your
age the only people I knew were black, and all of them were powerfully,
adamantly, dangerously afraid," he writes. "I felt the fear in the
visits to my Nana's home in Philadelphia," Coates continues. "And I saw
it in my own father." My father was so very afraid. I felt it in the
sting of his black leather belt, which he applied with more anxiety than
anger, my father who beat me as if someone might steal me away, because
that is exactly what was happening all around us. Coates describes his
condition, and that of all black people, as a "birthmark of damnation."
The resistance stories passed down to Fannie Lou and so many others
spurred them to march. Coates's narrative, riddled with fear and
futility, begs us to retreat. [[Though]{.mark} Coates has [never
explicitly cited]{.mark} it as [his]{.mark} theoretical
[framework]{.mark}, the dour outlook of his work [evokes]{.mark} the
themes of **[Afro-Pessimism]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [The pivot to the
ontological]{.underline}]{.mark} that is apparent in Coates's rhetoric
[[is]{.mark} a [hallmark]{.mark} of Afro-Pessimism]{.underline}.
"[Ontology by definition is the study of being, and [to speak of
Blackness as]{.mark} an [ontological]{.mark} condition [means
analyzing]{.mark} the state of [Black bodies through]{.mark} the lens of
[slavery]{.mark}]{.underline}," Afro-Pessimist scholar Michael Barlow,
Jr., writes in the academic journal Inquiries. However, for Barlow,
[[the relation of slavery that ontologically defines blackness
is]{.mark} not a matter of political economy, but rather **a
"[libidinal]{.mark} economy."** In this telling]{.underline}, labor and
ownership --- that is, political economy --- are merely incidental to
racial slavery. Instead, [it's [the white imagination and its]{.mark}
depraved "metaphysical [desires for Black flesh]{.mark}" that both
predated and catalyzed racialized chattel slavery. **[Racism is reduced
to the spiritual]{.mark}, [more]{.mark} a matter of a [sin]{.mark}ful
nature [than]{.mark} a [political struggle]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Coates has echoed this retreat to interiority, to the spiritual, to
consciousness]{.underline}. **[[It's the ontological pivot that
leads]{.underline}]{.mark}** Frank **[[Wilderson]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
perhaps the world's foremost Afro-Pessimist, **[[to
declare]{.underline}]{.mark}** in his foundational text "Gramsci's Black
Marx: Whither the Slave in Civil Society?" **[that [black people are no
more than cows in a slaughterhouse]{.mark}. Wilderson posits that "death
of the black body is foundational to the life of American civil
society," just as a cow's death is essential to the
slaughterhouse.]{.underline}** Flippantly, Wilderson asks, "how would
the cows fare under a dictatorship of the proletariat?" Coates adopts a
similar sense of impotence. He characterizes struggle as aimless toil
--- an apolitical end in itself. "The struggle is really all I have for
you," he tells his son, "because it is the only portion of this world
under your control." Yet how are we to struggle against earthquakes and
physical laws? How can we fight gravity? Both Coates and Wilderson speak
of power in terms of dreams. Coates writes of monolithic white
"Dreamers," those whose investment in the American Dream requires a
faith in their own whiteness. Similarly, Wilderson sees America as
enacting two distinct dreams. For Wilderson, "the dream of black
accumulation and death" is separate from "the dream of worker
exploitation." Ultimately, [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} both Coates's and
[[Wilderson's]{.underline}]{.mark} respective
[[framework]{.underline}s]{.mark}, **[[solidarity is
unimaginable]{.underline}]{.mark}** and class struggle is rendered
futile. Though Coates does not go to the lengths Wilderson does to
position himself in opposition to materialist politics, the result is
effectively equivalent: a separation of race and class combined with a
deep skepticism of class-based solidarity, reforms, or even revolution.
This is a turn away from the Freedom Tradition embodied by Fannie Lou
Hamer. For her, the problem of racism wasn't cosmology or ontology ---
it was an expression of politics implicated in class antagonism. Fannie
Lou Hamer stood "with the masses," both white and black. Solidarity
through struggle from below, including class struggle, formed her path
to victory. Coates's ontological pivot is more muddled than Wilderson's.
Fleetingly peppered throughout his work are allusions to material
reality, betraying the imposition of metaphysical abstraction that
ultimately drives his perspective. "We did not choose our fences," he
writes. "They were imposed on us by Virginia planters obsessed with
enslaving as many Americans as possible." Coates knows that Virginia
planters did not invent gravity or earthquakes. Yet this historicizing
impulse does not prevent him from essentializing racism when he
confronts it head on. In string of tweets from December 2016, Coates
conceded that racism is not transcendental, noting that "at its very
root it was always economic." But acknowledging racism's economic impact
has not led him to embrace class struggle. Even Frank Wilderson can
acknowledge that racism has an economic impact, but he still believes
that class struggle and racism exist on distinct planes. Coates holds a
similar belief; that racism is wholly different in kind from class. In
the same series of tweets, he concluded that "in America, 'class' isn't
the only kind of class." [Just as he mystifies racism, even while
locating its impact in the bodies of black people, here he again pivots.
[Coates cannot address material politics]{.mark} on its own terms,
[preferring]{.mark} instead [to retreat to]{.mark} a [contrived
mystification]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**He replaces action with
interiority.** As he recently told an auditorium of eager Northwestern
students, "The process should not be... people looking out at the world
and saying, 'I would like for there to be change in the world, how do I
do that?'" Instead, he implored the crowd to engage from the
"inside-out, not outside-in... because if you are in the business of
justice, and making this society more democratic, you might get a lot of
disappointment."]{.underline} Consciousness matters, of course. "Baby
you just got to love 'em," Fannie Lou Hamer would say of the white
segregationists who routinely threatened her life. "Hating just makes
you sick and weak." This was Hamer in a reflexive moment, but it was no
retreat. In the very next breath, she warned, "I keep a shotgun in every
corner of my bedroom and the first cracker even look like he wants to
throw some dynamite on my porch won't write his mama again." Fannie Lou
truly was her mother's daughter. Reflection, whether through
intergenerational story or her own thoughts, enhanced her resistance.
The same cannot be said of Coates. [[Instead of]{.mark} finding relief
in [political action, Coates]{.mark} finds it in a cookout at Howard
University's homecoming, surrounded by black people]{.underline}. [He
[fantasizes]{.mark} that he is "disappearing into all of their bodies,"
as the **[music and dancing]{.mark}**, the black cultural zeitgeist of
the moment, [cure him of the "birthmark of
damnation."]{.mark}]{.underline} [The curse is lifted. Blackness is
transfigured, becoming a space "beyond the Dream." [It's another
**ontological pivot**]{.mark}, this time [allowing Coates to
conclude]{.mark} that The Mecca's" --- his term for Howard ---
[**cookout** has a "power more gorgeous than a]{.mark}ny **[voting
rights bill]{.mark}**." **[It's a fantasy of
retreat]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as if black culture were beyond the
machinations of capitalism, as though black cultural expression existed
in the world but was not of it and were enough to take us to a new one.
Between the World and Me concludes with Coates considering climate
change. He sees climate change as a manifestation of a polluted white
consciousness, rather than the unfettered excess of industrial
capitalism. It is a "noose around the neck of the earth," allegedly
resulting in large part from white flight, the mid-century exodus of
negrophobic white families to the suburbs and the pollution caused by
the cars that took them there. [[Coates's words]{.mark} here [are
**poetic but grossly inaccurate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[They mimic
Afro-Pessimism's emphasis on]{.mark} the white [libido]{.mark},
[relegating]{.mark} his [rhetoric to the]{.mark} realm of interior life,
the [**souls of white folks**, and stopping]{.mark} well **[short of the
political]{.mark}** domain]{.underline}. For Coates, the Civil Rights
movement was not a struggle to alter a material world; rather the "hope
of the movement" was merely to "awaken the Dreamers." Black politics is
only relevant as far as it can arouse white consciousness, which he sees
as a largely futile exercise, due to "the small chance of the Dreamers
coming into consciousness." Coates sees common interest between the
black elite and the black poor, as he marvels at "the entire diaspora,"
from lawyers to street hustlers, present at Howard's homecoming. Yet he
cannot conceive of anti-capitalist class solidarity across racial
identity. He has a darker vision, of a kind that Corey Robin has
described as "apocalypticism." Coates's ultimate hope is not in
collective human action, but rather the total annihilation of the world
and all those living in it--- another feature that unites him with
Afro-Pessimism, which calls explicitly for the "end of the world." As he
says of the Dreamers, "the field for their Dream, the stage where they
have painted themselves white, is the deathbed of us all."
Paradoxically, though he can see a collective fate in apocalypse, he
rejects shared struggle for liberation. "The Dreamers will have to learn
to struggle themselves," he declares. The problem is, the whole of
capitalist enterprise, both past and present, cannot be reduced to race
as Original Sin. Left out of Coates's mythology is the fact that
colonial enterprise, in what would become the United States, relied
first on European indentured servants, most of whom died within a
handful of years after arriving on the continent. [[It's Coates's
reading]{.mark} of race as sin [that pushes him to imagine a
**perverted**]{.mark} **form of [salvation in the]{.mark} fantasy of
[apocalypse]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In this racial fatalism,
reparations for slavery emerges as the anticipation of the inevitable
Judgement Day]{.underline}. It is therefore no surprise that Coates has
taken up racial reparations as his cross to bear --- not to change the
world, but to condemn it.

Nonetheless, the fact that the main current of [[Afropessimist thinking
runs **counter to all**]{.mark} **of [Black political history]{.mark}**
and tradition thus far]{.underline}; the fact that [the foundational
thinker for this perspective, Frantz [Fanon]{.mark}, [came to]{.mark}
completely [opposing conclusions]{.mark} with respect to the nature of
politics]{.underline} and solidarity in struggle; the fact that [[the
theory]{.mark} often appears to [evade scrutiny]{.mark} or contestation
[by proclaiming itself]{.mark} "meta-theoretical" and
"[ontological]{.mark}"]{.underline}; the fact that [it asserts a
"mandate" for which [no empirical evidence]{.mark} is
[provided]{.mark}]{.underline} and in the face of overwhelming evidence
that it constitutes at best a minoritarian and class-specific position
--- all of this has to be reckoned with by those who want to take
Afropessimism to heart.

Perhaps it's worth reminding ourselves that when he was murdered, Fred
Hampton was encouraging poor whites to analogize their position to that
of poor Blacks. At the time of his assassination, Malcolm X was
embracing and actively seeking to incorporate a cross-racial coalition
into his new organization. Ella Baker actively encouraged the deepening
of organizational ties and activist links across different communities
by emphasizing common struggle and common oppression. [[What evidence do
we have]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand, [that the
[power]{.mark} behind the status quo [is quaking at]{.mark} the thought
of [Black folk gathering **in isolation** to **mourn the end of the
world**]{.mark}?]{.underline}

If the challenge is more narrowly intellectual and what is needed are
correctives to white Marxist hubris, Cedric Robinson's Black Marxism
(1983) already exists. Black feminist thought offers its own
counternarratives. Of course, Wilderson doesn't have to agree with
Robinson or the Combahee River Collective. But isn't it a problem that
they aren't cited even once in his books? Are we to jettison our entire
tradition? Were all those who came before us so hopelessly naïve? Are we
going to cast aside Vincent Harding's There Is a River and read nothing
but Fanon, Lacan, and Heidegger? Is Bantu philosophy overdetermined by
social death even if its worldview was constructed in the absence of the
white gaze? Afropessimism has yet to tackle these questions, to take its
opponent's counterarguments and positions seriously.

David Marriott, who is cited by Wilderson as a fellow Afropessimist,
asks in his own work: whither Fanon? I wonder this, too. Wilderson says
he is the figure he modeled himself on as a young man. Clearly Fanon is
central to all of his thinking; indeed, all Afropessimist theorists
consider Black Skin, White Masks (1952) a cornerstone text. It is an
extraordinary philosophical work, and they are right that it is too
often underappreciated. But it is also an extremely complicated
intellectual experiment. The third sentence of that book is: "I'm not
the bearer of absolute truths." Fanon proposes to work through the
problem of the abjection of Blackness, and that process extends beyond
the book into the engaged existentialist revolt and the analysis of
colonial relations that he explicitly argues involves the colonized
subject, regardless of their race, in The Wretched of the Earth (1961).
But even if one were to read only Black Skin, White Masks, it is
impossible to miss the humanist assumptions that it opens onto in its
conclusion. [[What]{.mark} else [can one make of Fanon stating]{.mark}
that "**[I am not a slave]{.mark} to slavery that dehumanized my
ancestors**," [and]{.mark} that "**the [density of History determines
none of my acts]{.mark}**. I am my own foundation"? How can one miss
[the assumption of a **shareable humanity**]{.mark} when he insists that
"at the end of this book we would like the reader to feel with us the
open dimension of every consciousness."]{.underline} How can Fanon's
trajectory into the Algerian War of Independence be reconciled with the
null trajectories that Afropessimism proposes?

If Afropessimism pushes us to pose harder and sharper questions as Fanon
prayed his Black body always would, if it serves to break the shallow
cant of the media class and its operatives --- then certainly it will
have done some good. But on the terms of its own presiding genius it
needs to be understood as a waystation and not a terminus on the road to
disalienation that Fanon argued is the only path to freedom for Black
people in the modern world. That path, which he described in terms of
building a "new man," required him to first understand the depth of
abjection that Blackness had been cast into, and then to undo that
abjection by mobilizing its ejection from the political order of the
West in a grand historical struggle to reconstruct that civilization
from the side of the oppressed, an embrace that clearly involves a
radical solidarity with non-Black people. This was the mission Fanon was
on when he died, and it was a mission he believed Black peoples would
have a special, indeed, foundational role in ultimately seeing through.

Realizing these goals does not mean adhering to a formulaic principle or
that Black people need to think, act, or speak as a monolith. [[Fanon
and Wilderson are]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[fond of]{.mark} citing
Aimé [Césaire's phrase]{.mark} about "[the end of the
world]{.mark}"]{.underline} from his poem Notebook of a Return to the
Native Land:

One must begin somewhere.

Begin what?

The only thing in the world worth beginning:

The End of the world of course.

These lines do not appear at the end of the poem, however, but roughly
halfway through it. The interjection, "of course," stands in here for
the French word "parbleu," which, even in the late 1930s when Césaire
was composing his poem in Paris, carried a folksy and bathetic ring that
is only dimly captured in the English but is easier to hear if you
imagine these lines as having strayed from a play by Samuel Beckett.
[Wilderson intones this phrase repeatedly]{.underline} in his book,
[wielding it like a totemic hammer portending world-destroying
events]{.underline} that, in light of the commitments of his own theory,
seem to suggest, [and]{.underline} possibly [wish for, a zero-sum war
between the races]{.underline}. But [[Césaire's usage
is]{.underline}]{.mark} far more ambivalent and
**[[ironic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the cry of a man whose revolutionary
action must first and foremost be directed inwardly toward a poetic
reconstruction of the self, a liberation that requires a self-determined
and self-realizing pursuit of truth.

Fanon admired and respected no other intellectual more than Césaire. We
know from his letters to his French publisher François Maspero that he
imagined his writings as adressed, in no small part, to and for him. The
idiosyncratic prose style of Black Skin, White Masks is Fanon's way of
signifying upon a correspondence with Césaire's poetics. Both writers
are acutely aware that the Black thinker is poised precariously between
the poles of reflection and action. But both are committed to a
humanistic pursuit of truth and both believe in the promise of a radiant
Blackness whose time is not yet come. This is why, even as the Algerian
War raged around him, Fanon continued his psychiatric research,
convinced that understanding the traumas of war and torture would be
necessary for healing the postrevolutionary body politic. He wrote for
the present and for the future in pursuit of an understanding of himself
and of human nature, and for the cause of a political independence and
freedom that he hoped would set the entire African continent on a new
course. Had he lived, he would have persevered until every colonialist
regime from Algiers to Cape Town (the title he had in mind for his last
book was Alger-Le Cap) had been driven off the continent. [Fanon was no
pessimist: true revolutionaries never are.]{.underline}

¤

But [must we revolve around Fanon]{.underline} in the first place? Today
many activists are more inspired by Fannie Lou Hamer. [The US context
has]{.underline} its own [problems that Fanon only barely]{.underline}
understood and [addressed]{.underline}. [Why not return]{.underline}
instead, in this hour of national contestation, [to]{.underline} a
figure like [David Walker and his Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the
World]{.underline}; But in Particular and Very Expressly to those of the
United States of America from 1829? We still underappreciate the
importance of this text, [one of the seminal documents that captures the
first great Black intellectual debate in the United States, which was an
argument over whether or not we ought to stay in the country at all.
Walker believed we should]{.underline}, and he was the first to define
and defend the monumental implications of that choice. [He attacked the
mighty lobby of the American Colonization Society, which
included]{.underline} the powerful senator Henry [Clay]{.underline},
Abraham [Lincoln, and]{.underline} many [leading [Black
intellectuals]{.mark} of the day, who were convinced full equality for
Blacks in America was neither possible nor desirable and advocated
emigration]{.underline}. Their plans revolved around evacuating the
Black population to the Pepper Coast, now the country of Liberia, which
emerged from colonial schemes like "Mississippi-in-Africa" that the
American Colonization Society founded in the 1830s.

[We [**could** have abandoned the country]{.mark}]{.underline}. History
could have taken a very different course. American slaves could have
returned to Africa and [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates **[could
have become a white ethno-state]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a second Europe.
The 1820s and '30s were the last possible moment of undoing or
preventing the existence of a Black America. **[[But Black American
intellectuals made the choice to stay]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- [to
hold this ground and make something new here that the world had never
seen.]{.underline} As the political scientist Melvin Rogers points out,
[Walker's Appeal]{.underline} not only staked this argument in terms of
a principled Black nationalist claim based on the enormous sacrifice of
"blood and tears" in slavery; the rhetorical address of the text was
also [intended to awaken Black Americans to their own potential [as a
nationally]{.mark} self-[consciously]{.mark} political [community with a
**global** outlook]{.mark}.]{.underline} "\[F\]or \[Walker\]," Rogers
writes, "African Americans did not need a prophet to whom they should
blindly defer. Rather they needed a community willing to confront
practices of domination, capable of responding to their grievances, and
susceptible to transcending America's narrow ethical and political
horizon."

Wilderson's [[Afropessimism insists]{.mark} that [we are still
slaves]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Walker insisted]{.underline}]{.mark} in
1829 that the [[slaves are]{.underline}]{.mark} (and were even then)
["colored [citizens]{.mark}" of the United States]{.underline} and of
the world. That if we are oppressed it is only because we are ignorant
of our true strength, because we have been taught to disbelieve and
disavow our worth to the world, to the nation, and to each other. [Which
of these]{.underline} two [views is the correct one?]{.underline} [I
think the historical record and the present state of our politics tells
us all we need to know]{.underline} on that score. For it is no
coincidence that today it is Black Americans who are once again trying
to save the country, to invest in finishing the work of making this
place a home that we can live in. In what is a long-standing pattern,
[the "coloured [citizens]{.mark}" of this country [are at the forefront
of]{.mark} practicing **[civics]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Indeed, what
could be more republican than risking one's health to restore the health
of the body politic? [[To ensure]{.mark} that one of the most basic
[promises of the state is]{.mark} properly
[fulfilled]{.mark}]{.underline}: [that it apply its law enforcement
equally]{.underline}, humanely, and in a manner accountable to the
people it serves.

As in past struggles, our principled defense of an ethical civil code
has attracted others with its moral force. We have seen a massive
response, including from sources traditionally opposed to these
concerns, who recognize the profoundly dysfunctional culture of US
policing, prisons, and courts. Even many of those who do not agree that
these are the result of actively racist policies and attitudes no longer
deny that our exceptionally poor record cannot plausibly be unrelated to
a long history of antiblack violence and antagonism. For this same
reason, [likeminded **[people around the world]{.mark}** are hoping for
a decisive break with the past‚ taking to the streets across the globe
to [demand that state actors acknowledge]{.mark} that there really is a
history of [injury]{.mark} that needs to stop being denied, [and]{.mark}
that we can and should [work]{.mark} together [to design a new social
contract]{.mark} that will restore the perceived legitimacy]{.underline}
of law enforcement and criminal justice [in the eyes of all citizens and
not just some]{.underline}.

The generation undertaking [[these]{.mark} endeavors [do]{.mark}es
[not]{.mark} seem to [require]{.mark} a narrative of
[optimism]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to take the great risks they
have incurred. [They have a healthy indifference to both optimism and
pessimism alike. Perhaps [it results from]{.mark} the demands of
carrying out politics in the real world. The]{.underline} incredibly
difficult [task of organizing and [strategizing]{.mark}]{.underline} in
order [[to]{.mark} elevate and [amplify the **best** responses
and]{.mark} to rein in and [temper]{.mark} the [counterproductive
ones]{.mark} that delay and diminish a good cause]{.underline}. That's
hard to do in the best of cases: in a turbulent, paranoid, and instantly
videotaped public sphere, it's a Sisyphean task that bad-faith
commentators take advantage of.

None of this diminishes the fundamental need for greater self-capacity
of the kind Walker called for 200 years ago. Much of the work ahead will
necessarily involve a growing capacity for self-reflection,
self-criticism, irony, and joy in our politics. It will require
acknowledging that struggles against white oppression will never be
successful without deepened self-healing in our communities: repairing
the relations in families, between men and women; ending the violence
directed at trans, queer, and otherwise non-conforming people in our
neighborhoods; ending the heinous blood feuds between rival gangs and
sets; restoring education and communal trust as our highest priorities
and most cherished aspirations. These will always remain preconditional
to the realization of freedom and autonomy. It is pursuing these aims as
an ongoing collective activity that will make unavoidable the
realization as [Walker said]{.underline}, that [[this country is]{.mark}
"**[more ours]{.mark}**" than anyone else's]{.underline} --- that [we
are a historic people with a world-historical destiny that understands
[our suffering]{.mark} as [endow]{.mark}ing [us with]{.mark} both [the
right]{.mark} and the responsibility [of civilizing the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [in]{.mark}]{.underline} such [[a way
that]{.underline}]{.mark} it [[reflects]{.mark} the values that our
historical experiences bring to it]{.underline}, the freedoms,
equalities, [and]{.underline} cultural [[pluralisms]{.mark} that
[we]{.mark} have [made]{.mark}]{.underline} vital and [[central to its
identity]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[One doesn't need to hang on desperately to a mirage of hope. If we look
to history, [we]{.mark} can [see]{.mark} more than enough [concrete
evidence]{.mark} and example to support the conclusion [that a
racial]{.mark}ly defined [caste system is unlikely to]{.mark} ever again
[prevail]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of course, [[that doesn't mean
history]{.mark} is [a smooth]{.mark}ly [upward]{.mark}-[trend]{.mark}ing
curve. [We]{.mark} [have]{.mark} known terrible
[setbacks]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yes, [the]{.underline} violent [[defeat
of Reconstruction was successful. But]{.mark} the building of Black
institutions and [the Niagara Movement proceeded]{.mark} anyway. Tulsa
was burned]{.underline} to the ground. [But its Black
citizens]{.underline} turned right around and [rebuilt it]{.underline}
out of the ashes. [The [Civil Rights]{.mark} movement [was
checked]{.mark} by]{.underline} the forces of reaction and [the
assassin]{.underline}'s bullet; [[but the world of unquestioned
white]{.mark} superiority and [authority]{.mark}]{.underline} that
George Wallace hoped to preserve [[is reduced]{.mark} now to a twinkle
in David Duke's blue eye]{.underline}. Yes, creepy white supremacists
still crawl out from under mossy stones at opportune moments to wail
about their Nordic fantasies in their over-sized khaki pants. Yes, like
the militants of the Islamic State, they are capable of carrying out
horrific acts of terror and violence. But like that barbaric and
fanatical sect, white supremacy is permanently confined to such
rear-guard actions because it has already lost --- it is trying to
reverse a clock going forward --- which explains the virulence and
incoherence of its outbursts of spastic violence.

We are not at the end, but near the beginning of something new. The

[is]{.underline} that it turns out [[there's a **morning after the end

hardest truth is that all the uncertainties that govern [the question

an impasse against an implacable enemy. [They would insist that we lift

II\. The Flatness of Blackness

Afro-pessimism in this original sense has reflected a disastrous
approach to, and had disastrous consequences for Africa and its
inhabitants. So how can we understand the bizarre use of this
historically loaded term (complete with its own history of colonial and
imperialist exploitation) by numerous African-American intellectuals and
activists? The [use of the term 'Afro-pessimism']{.underline} is
[symptomatic of the]{.underline} **[historical ignorance]{.underline}**
[of the Afro-pessimist]{.underline}™ (or what Greg Thomas has recently
called Afro-pessimism 2.0), whose grasp of African history is about as
solid as that of Hegel. In its initial iteration, Afro-pessimism 2.0
(from now on AP™) is a [product of **middle-class
academia**]{.underline}; a [framework]{.underline} either
[consciously]{.underline} or subconsciously [created]{.underline} to
[allow relatively well-off academics t]{.underline}o **[view themselves
as the most discriminated and oppressed people in the
world]{.underline}**. [Characterised by]{.underline}
**[misinterpretations]{.underline}** and clever **[appropriations of
Black radicals]{.underline}** like Frantz Fanon and Silvia Wynter, the
[theories]{.underline} of the AP™ have **[spilled over into activist
circles]{.underline}**, [contaminating the **global political discourse
on race.**]{.underline}

The [central premise]{.underline} of the AP™ [is that anti-Black
violence is the structuring regime of the modern world]{.underline}.
Drawing on Orlando Patterson's concept of 'social death', Frank
[Wilderson]{.underline}, arguably the most prominent and controversial
AP™ intellectual, ass[erts that the Black condition is not characterised
by oppression or exploitation]{.underline}, like that of the Marxist
proletariat or the (neo)colonial subject, [but rather by the distinction
between the Human and the Slave]{.underline}. For Wilderson, the Black
is a priori a slave and therefore we cannot speak of Blackness without
reference to the Slaveness that constitutes it on an ontological level.
In his essay 'Ante-Anti-Blackness: Afterthoughts', fellow University of
California professor Jared Sexton argues that the condition of the
Black/Slave is a state of total powerlessness, natal alienation ('the
loss of ties of birth in both ascending and descending generations') and
generalised dishonour. In short, Black existence is an ontological
absence of sorts, and the Black/Slave is a living dead (non-entity) in
the modern world.

In 'The Black Liberation Army and the Paradox of Political Engagement',
Wilderson offers some further meditations on the concept of 'social
death', explaining that 'the point of social death is a condition, void,
not of land, but of a capacity to secure relational status through
transindividual objects -- be those objects elaborated by land, labour
or love'. [Unlike colonial racisms perpetuated by the rational systems
of white supremacy, neo-colonialism or imperialism, or women's
oppression and exploitation driven by patriarchy and capitalism's need
for reproductive labour, anti-Black violence is humanity's irrational
desire for violence against Black peopl]{.underline}e[.]{.underline} As
Wilderson declares in an interview with C. S. Soong, 'violence against
Black people is a mechanism for the usurpation of subjectivity, of life
of being'. What settlers wanted from Indians is land, so they killed
Indians 'in the main' to get it, whereas what non-Blacks want from
Blacks is not land but 'being'. Anti-Blackness is thus qualitatively
different from the regimes of violence that affect the Marxist
proletariat; or the non-Black person of colour; or the non-Black woman;
or the non-Black woman of colour; or (as Wilderson has famously claimed)
Palestinians. Black suffering is incomparable and unique: to speak of
any experience of oppression without reference to the ontological
disparities between Black/non-Black people is ultimately an act of
'anti-Blackness'.

But [what exactly is it about the makeup of modern society that
displaces the Black/Slave from the realm of politics]{.underline} and
precludes the articulation of concrete political demands? For Wilderson
and Sexton, the very foundations of political discourse are inherently
anti-Black. Or, to put it in terms of Giorgio Agamben's political
ontology (of which the AP™ are rather fond), the political -- i.e. the
ontological character of a political situation that separates it from
other social actions -- or what he calls 'the Symbolic Order', is skewed
against the Black/Slave. The Symbolic Order is based on the recognition
of the 'other's' humanity, which then enables this 'other' to challenge
the order on the grounds of, for instance, political economy. Since the
Black is a priori a Slave, and Blackness and Slaveness are coterminous,
the Black/Slave cannot participate in the Symbolic Order as her status
is not that of the Human. And because the category of humanity is
founded and relies on the existence of the slave, there is no way the
Black/Slave can ever gain the recognition required to assert political
demands and identities in the realm of the Symbolic Order. It is for
this reason that, as Sexton points out in his essay 'The Social Life of
Social Death: On Afro-Pessimism and Black Optimism', we must posit a
'political ontology dividing the Slave from the world of the Human in a
constitutive way' and take this as our analytical starting point.

[Wilderson's and Sexton's work contributes to a wider
debate]{.underline} on the [nature of Black studies]{.underline} in the
United States, which is frequently tied into discussions on Black
performance art, evidenced by the titles of Wilderson's Red, White and
Black: Cinema and the Structure of US Antagonisms, Kara Keeling's The
Witch's Flight: The Cinematic, the Black Femme, and the Image of Common
Sense or Fred Moten's essays on Black Operations/Black Optimism in
musical performance. Despite various disagreements and differences among
these scholars, they are united by the common interest in 'the afterlife
of slavery' -- first described by Saidiya Hartman in her 2006 memoir
Lose Your Mother. For Hartman -- whose project is not that of AP™ and
should not be mistaken for this essay's target -- official abolition in
the United States did not engender a decisive break with the racialised
violence of slavery; in contemporary society, we can see traces of such
violence in the 'skewed life chances, limited access to health and
education, premature death, incarceration, and impoverishment' of
African-Americans. The 'afterlife of slavery' she describes constitutes
Black studies' object, and loosely ties a range of scholars together
into a coherent discourse.

It is worth briefly considering Fred Moten's work to understand the
AP™'s ability to co-opt or usurp other approaches to Black Studies and
activism. Moten attempted to counter the AP™ conception of social death
by foregrounding Black agency and asserting that it is ontologically
prior to the all-encompassing anti-Blackness of the modern world. In the
unpublished paper 'Black Optimism/Black Operation', Moten attempts to
counter the 'anti-essentialism' of radical discourses that disavow Black
studies' own object i.e. Blackness. For Moten, this Blackness exists in
what he (along with his frequent collaborator Stefano Harney) has
famously called 'the undercommons' -- a space outside of official social
structures, where Black people can assert their 'right to refuse'.

But as Annie Olaloku-Teriba points out in her excellent critique
'Afro-Pessimism and the (Un)Logic of Anti-Blackness', the AP™ finds a
'comfortable antagonist' in Moten, whose Black Ops can be neatly
reintegrated into the concept of social death. It is also telling that
Sexton, in 'Ante-Anti-Blackness', rather successfully merges the AP™
conception of social death with Moten's Black Ops by arguing that:

A living death is as much a death as it is living. Nothing in
Afro-pessimism suggests that there is no black (social) life, only that
black life is not social life in the universe formed by the codes of
state and civil society, of citizen and subject, of nation and culture,
of people and place, of history and heritage, of all the things that
colonial society has in common with the colonised, of all the things
that capital has in common with labour -- the modern world system.

Sexton shows that Moten's Black Ops is nothing other than what he
instead calls 'the social life of social death'. There is no either/or
distinction between social life and social death: we can think both
together by positing that Black life is lived in the underground. Moten
even acknowledges, in 'Blackness and Nothingness (Mysticism in the
Flesh)', that the AP™ and Black Ops are engaged in the same theoretical
project:

In the end, though life and optimism are the terms under which I speak,
I agree with Sexton -- by way of the slightest most immeasurable
reversal of emphasis -- that Afro-pessimism and black optimism are not
but nothing other than one another. I will continue to prefer the black
optimism of his work just as, I am sure, he will continue to prefer the
Afro-pessimism of mine.

For both Afro-pessimists and Black Optimists, the afterlife of slavery
is characterised by the social death of the Black/Slave and a heavily
distorted version of Fanon's concept of the 'fact of blackness'. This
assumption, however, precludes the participation of Black Ops in radical
politics and confines resistance to spaces of Black performance art.

[By confining Black resistance to spaces outside of the anti-Black
structures of civil society]{.underline}, and by **[undercutting the
possibility for anti-imperialist solidarity]{.underline}** [between
racialised people]{.underline} across the world, the [AP™
theories]{.underline} have **[opened up a space for the corporate
capture of Blackness]{.underline}**. We need only recall [last year's
Nike campaign]{.underline}, prominently [featuring the face
o]{.underline}f former NFL quarterback Colin [Kaepernick]{.underline},
who has been blackballed by the league for [kneeling]{.underline} during
the national anthem. Since the incident, [he has taken on the role of
radical Black activi]{.underline}st, complete with Panther-esque leather
jackets, an afro and Afrocentric jewellery. [While Kaepernick's struggle
against the racist and exploitative NFL owners and
executives]{.underline} is, of course, [legitimate]{.underline} and
necessary, the co-**[optation of his struggle]{.underline}** by a large
corporation [is certainly a cause for concern]{.underline}. [Nike is
notorious for its use of sweatshop labour]{.underline} (including both
forced and child labour), and its history of exploitative labour
practices has been well-documented throughout the years. [By detaching
the struggles of African-Americans from those of racialised
workers]{.underline} in the Global South, [Nike can present itself as a
progressive vehicle for Black emancipatory politics]{.underline}, while
**[completely sidelining the plight of non-white workers outside of the
US]{.underline}**. Here we might recall a powerful statement by Fred
Hampton to illustrate just how far from revolutionary Black politics we
find ourselves:

We don't think you fight fire with fire best; we think you fight fire
with water best. We're going to fight racism not with racism, but we're
going to fight with solidarity. We say we're not going to fight
capitalism with black capitalism, but we're going to fight it with
socialism \[...\] We're going to fight \[...\] with all of us people
getting together and having an international proletarian revolution.

[Wilderson and Sexton have been]{.underline} **[captured by corporate
interests]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} much **[the same
way]{.underline}**. In their case, however, it is not a large
corporation that co-opts Blackness, but rather **[the neoliberal
university]{.underline}**. Is it at all surprising that [two professors
working within the prestigious University of California system
promote]{.underline} a **[theoretical framework that requires no
political action]{.underline}** [from Black writers and
activists]{.underline} [other than simply being Black?]{.underline} Not
only is AP™ a product of the neoliberal university, it also **[promotes
its authors survival and flourishing within the corporate structures of
higher education]{.underline}**. When asked about his framework for
psychological and physical resistance by the hosts of iMiXWHATiLiKE,
[Wilderson]{.underline} neatly [dodges]{.underline} **[any commitment to
radical politics]{.underline}** [with the excuse that it could cost him
his academic job.]{.underline}

This is so much a part of what it means to be a professor. I feel like
cussing people out all the time. But if I do, I violate University of
California's civility laws, tenure or not I'm out the door, right? And
that tempers my speech. So, I think that what I have to offer is not a
way out. What I have to offer is an analysis of the problem. And I don't
trust me as much as I trust Black people on the ground.

Wilderson is aware that the [AP™ rely on **their activist
supporters**]{.underline} and social media [following to **maintain
their privileged position within the university**]{.underline} --
without the activists and organisers on the ground, the AP™ could not
prove the market value of its work to the neoliberal institution. [By
creating a framework for the analysis of race that lends itself to
co-optation by corporate interests]{.underline}, the **[AP™ has
certainly demonstrated that it can convert Blackness into
profit]{.underline}**. [All the while, these theorists delude themselves
that they are spearheading a **truly radical Black
movement**]{.underline}. In the introduction to a collection of essays
on AP™, the editors (who presumably include Sexton and Wilderson) even
have the audacity to claim that they are 'motivated by a desire to
contribute to \[...\] bringing these writings out of the ivory towers of
the academy' and that they wish to 'remove the materials from this
sitting place and see them proliferate among those in the streets and
prisons'. True, they have succeeded in disseminating a watered-down
version of their musings to activists and organisers; but [what they
have passed on is nothing short **of anti-Blac**]{.underline}k, in the
sense **[that it works against the true liberation of Black people of
all classes.]{.underline}**

Today, [such Blackness]{.underline} (and the pseudo-politics that is
attached to it) is [more useful for academic promotions, Instagram
hashtags, and Nike adverts than for]{.underline} any **[revolutionary or
emancipatory politics]{.underline}** worthy of the name. [The people
who]{.underline} truly benefit -- or rather [profit]{.underline} -- from
the AP™ brand [are the academics and the various university presses and
journals]{.underline} who **[jump at every opportunity to unleash a
plethora of AP™ books and articles]{.underline}** onto the academic book
market. While the AP™ may seem like a niche theoretical discourse, its
influence extends far beyond the university: as Olaloku-Teriba argues,
the AP™'s theoretical framework provides 'the structuring logic of
various political formations in the era of #BlackLivesMatter'. [What is
at stake in the debate]{.underline}, therefore, **[is nothing less than
the possibility of a revolutionary Black politics]{.underline}**. Maybe
African-Americans on the streets or in prison would do well to reach for
George Jackson's Soledad Brother and steer clear of the AP™ and Black
Ops.

III\. The Afterlives of Slavery

The retreat of the AP™ and Black Ops from politics poses a problem for
activists and scholars looking to engage in struggles that take
seriously the political economy of race and the need for cross-racial
solidarity. But how have these key themes of radical Black movements
from the 1960s and 70s -- from the Black Panthers to African
anti-colonial struggles -- disappeared in the AP™'s theories? [The
erasure of radical Black and anti-colonial struggles rests almost
entirely on **misreading**]{.underline} -- or in some cases not reading
-- [Marxist contributions to the study of race, colonialism and
slavery]{.underline}. And this unfounded dismissal of the entire Marxist
tradition allows the AP™ to kill two birds with one stone: on the one
hand, it can position itself as a radical critique of Eurocentric left
discourses. On the other hand, it allows the AP™ to disregard a vast
body of Marxist scholarship that has 'raced' the history of capitalism
and developed a nuanced analysis of the relationship between New World
Slavery and capitalist accumulation on a global scale. Thus, the [AP™
can ignore the specificities of how different Black populations are
racialised and displace]{.underline} the study of [political
economy]{.underline} (and particularly of imperialism) **[in favour of
ontological questions.]{.underline}**

In the interview 'We're trying to destroy the world: Anti-Blackness &
Police Violence after Ferguson' [Wilderson makes the bizarre
claim]{.underline} that '[slaveness is something that has consumed
Blackness and Africanness]{.underline}, **[making it impossible to
divide slavery from Blackness']{.underline}**. If this [assumption
sounds familiar]{.underline}, look [no further than **the Afro-pessimism
of old,**]{.underline} [with its conflation of Africanness and Blackness
and its **disregard for the African continent**]{.underline} and its
inhabitants. But how has an approach that attempts to grapple with the
complexities of Black being ended up rehashing the same assumptions and
prejudices of Eurocentric discourse designed to dehumanise Black people
on the African continent in the first place? The AP[™'s theoretical
position is riddled with contradictions]{.underline}: how [can Blackness
be separated from white supremacy, neocolonialism or imperialism and
women's reproductive labour,]{.underline} **[when these are the
mechanisms that structure the quotidien experience of most people
racialised as Black on a global scale?]{.underline}** Moreover, [if the
Black/Slave exists in a state of powerlessness and natal
alienation]{.underline} -- characterised by the loss of ties of birth in
ascending and descending generations -- [how do we theorise the
Blackness of those whose **ancestors remained in Africa**]{.underline}
throughout the translatlantic slave trade?

#### Anti-Blackness isn't historically calcified and their reading runs [counter]{.underline} to the Black radical tradition.

**Kelley 17** Gary B. Nash Professor of American History at UCLA (Robin
D.G., "Robin D.G. Kelley & Fred Moten In Conversation," transcribed from
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP-2F9MXjRE, 1:57:36-2:02:56, dml)

KELLEY: Um, Fred---Fred will take most of these questions. So that\'s
why I\'m going to begin first because he\'s gonna, he\'s gonna---he\'s
gonna end it because he, he, he has the answer to all these questions
'cause I turn to him for these questions. On the specific, on the first
question, I just want to make sure I understand it because I\'m, you
know, I don\'t always recognize, uh, it may be because I\'m just old,
but [I don\'t always recognize]{.underline}, uh, [that black
politics]{.underline}, black \[unclear---maybe "guys"\] work politics
[have been **structured** or **defined** by white
supremacy]{.underline}. I mean, white supremacy is there. And I guess
maybe because I\'m such a student of Cedric Robinson, you know, [**not
everything is about**, or **in response to**, white
supremacy]{.underline}. And in fact, one of the critiques coming out of
doing Southern history was this idea that race relations framework, that
race relations defines, uh, African-American history or Black history.
And [it\'s **simply not true** because much of what people do in terms
of]{.underline}, of [**[social formation]{.mark}**, **community
building**]{.underline}, um, is, is, is what Raymond Williams might call
alternative cultures. In other words, it [[may be **structured in
dominance**]{.mark} in some ways, [but **not defined by**]{.mark}
**it**]{.underline}. And [Cedric]{.underline}\'s Black Marxism, you
know, really made this point. He [talks about the **ontological
totality**]{.underline}, you know, the, this sense of being and making
ourselves whole, in that we come out of an experience, again, structured
by white supremacy, structured by violence, [**structured by
enslavement** and **dispossession**]{.underline}, but, [but one in which
**western hegemony didn\'t work**]{.underline}, you know, that modes of
thinking wasn\'t defined by Enlightenment modes of thinking. In other
words, that, that [part of the [Black radical tradition is]{.mark} a
**[refusal to be property]{.mark}**, to **even admit that human beings
could be property**]{.underline}. You know, so [[we]{.mark} sometimes
[give white supremacy]{.mark} **way [too much
credit]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and maybe I misunderstood the question.
And so I think that there\'s lots of things that happen outside of joy
and survival, and survival is important, but survival is not the end
all, you know. So I think, and I\'ll give you one very, very specific
example, and now I\'m not gonna say anything else after this. [The way
we have tended to more recently [treat **slavery**, **Jim Crow** and
**mass incarceration**]{.mark}]{.underline} as a piece, [[as]{.mark} the
**reinstantiation of [the same thing]{.mark}**, the **continuation**,
that **[denies]{.mark} the fact** [that these]{.mark} systems
[are]{.mark} **actually [distinct]{.mark}**, that they are
**historically specific**, [and]{.mark} in fact they're
**[responses]{.mark}**]{.underline} to, in many ways, [[to]{.mark} [the
**weakness** of]{.mark} this as [a racial regime]{.mark}]{.underline}.
So if you think of like the whole idea of the new Jim Crow to me is
very, very problematic. Um, although that book by Michelle Alexander is
very, very powerful and very useful in terms of educating people about
prisons. [Jim Crow was **not the continuation of slavery**]{.underline}.
It was not. [[Jim Crow was a **response to the Black
Democratic**]{.underline}]{.mark}, uh, [**[upsurge]{.mark}** after
slavery]{.underline}. It was a revolution of Reconstruction. [It was a
way to try to suppress that]{.underline}. The fact that, that, you know,
there was this incredible response. [That\'s why]{.underline} there\'s
a, [there\'s [a **huge gap** between]{.mark} 1877 at [the]{.mark}
official [end of Reconstruction and]{.mark} the [rise of Jim
Crow]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is [the 1890s, disfranchisement,
lynching]{.underline}. That\'s because [you\'ve had **13**, **14**,
**15**, **20**, [**25 years** of]{.mark} a **[democratic
possibility]{.mark}** and **struggle**. The **[same]{.mark} thing [with
mass incarceration]{.mark}**---yes, we\'ve had incarceration,
but]{.underline} it\'s, but that, that, that, [that **[upward
swing]{.mark}** has a lot to do [with]{.mark}, again, [**responses**
to]{.mark} the struggles in [the]{.mark} 19[60s]{.mark}]{.underline},
the assault on the Keynesian welfare-warfare state, the fact that you
know the, the war on political, the formation of political prisoners,
those struggles in fact was the state\'s response to opposition. And so
[if we **don\'t acknowledge that**]{.underline}, then [what [we end
up]{.mark} doing is [thinking]{.mark} that somehow there\'s a structure
of [white supremacy that\'s]{.mark} **unchanging**, [**fixed**, and **so
powerful we can\'t do anything**]{.mark} **about it** when in fact it\'s
the **opposite**. [White supremacy is **fragile**]{.mark}. White
supremacy is [**weak**. Racial regimes]{.mark} actually are
**[always]{.mark} having to [shore themselves up]{.mark}** precisely
[because they\'re **unstable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We can see that.
[We **can\'t see it** because the whole [system]{.mark}]{.underline} of
hegemony [is to [give]{.mark} us [the impression]{.mark} that [it is
**so powerful**]{.mark}, there\'s **no space out**. And [yet it's
**working overtime**]{.mark}]{.underline} to, [[to **respond to our
opposition**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Right. That may not answer your
question, but that\'s sort of a way I think about it. Maybe it's not
satisfactory, but yeah.

## Libidinal 

#### Socialization better explains their libidinal thesis

**Hudis 15** \[Peter, Professor of English and History @ Queens College,
2015, "Frantz Fanon: Philosopher of the Barricades," p. 35-37\]

Fanon's vantage point upon the world is his situated experience. He is
trying to understand the inner psychic life of racism, not provide an
account of the structure of human existence as a whole. [[Racism is
not]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course, [[an **integral part** of the human
psyche; it is a **Social construct**]{.mark} that has a **psychic
impact**. Any effort [to comprehend]{.mark} social distress that
accompanies [racism by reference to some a priori structure]{.mark}- be
it the Oedipal Complex or the Collective Unconscious- **is [doomed to
failure.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Carl Jung sought to deepen and go beyond
Freud\'s approach by arguing that the subconscious is grounded in a
universal layer of the psyche- which he called [[\"the collective
unconscious:]{.mark}\' This [refers to inherited patterns]{.mark} of
thought that exist in all human minds, regardless of specific culture or
upbringing]{.underline}, and which manifest themselves in dreams, fairy
tales, and myths. Jung referred to these universal patterns as
\"archetypes:\' It may seem, on a superficial reading, that 1 Fanon is
drawing from Jung, since he discusses how white people tend to
unconsciously assimilate views of blacks that are based on negative
stereotypes. Even the most \"progressive\" white tends to think of
blacks a certain way (such as \"emotional;\' \"physical,\" or /
\"aggressive\"), even as they disavow any racist animus on their part.
However, [[Fanon denies]{.mark} that such collective delusions are part
of a psychic structure]{.underline}; they [are]{.underline} not
[**[permanent features of the mind]{.mark}**. They are **habits**
acquired from a series of social and cultural impositions. While they
constitute a kind a collective unconscious on the part of many white
people, [they are not]{.mark} grounded in any **[universal]{.mark}**
\"archetype.\"]{.underline} The unconscious prejudices of whites do not
derive from genes or nature, nor do they derive from some form
independent of culture or upbringing. Fanon contends
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} Jung **[[\"confuses habit with
instinct.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}** Fanon objects to Jung\'s \"collective
unconscious\" for the same reason that he rejects the notion of a black
ontology. His phenomenological approach brackets out ontological claims
on both a social and psychological level insofar as the examination of
race and racism is concerned. He writes, \"Neither Freud nor Adler nor
even the cosmic Jung took the black man into consideration in the course
of his research." This does not mean that Fanon rejects their
contributions tout court. He does not deny the existence of the
unconscious. He only denies that the inferiority complex of blacks
operates on an unconscious level. [He does not reject the Oedipal
Complex. He only denies that it explains (especially in the West Indies)
the proclivity of the black \"slave\" to mimic the values of the white
\"master.\"]{.underline} And as seen from his positive remarks on
Lacan\'s theory of the mirror stage, he does not reject the idea of
psychic structure. He only denies that it can substitute for an
historical understanding of the origin of neuroses .23 Fanon adopts a
socio-genetic approach to a study of the psyche because that is what is
adequate for the object of his analysis. For Fanon, [it is the
relationship between the socio-economic and psychological that is of
critical import. He makes it clear, insofar as the subject matter of his
study is concerned, that the socio-economic is first of all
**responsible for affective disorders**]{.underline}: \"First, economic.
Then, internalization or rather epidermalization of this
inferiority.\"24 Fanon never misses an opportunity to remind us that
racism owes its origin to specific economic relations of domination-
such as slavery, colonialism, and the effort to coopt sections of the
working class into serving the needs of capital. It is hard to mistake
the Marxist influence here. It does not follow, however, that what comes
first in the order of time has conceptual or strategic priority. The
inferiority complex is originally born from economic subjugation, but it
takes on a life of its own and expresses itself in terms that surpass
the economic. Both sides of the problem-the socio-economic and
psychological-must be combatted in tandem: \"The black man must wage the
struggle on two levels; whereas historically these levels are mutually
dependent, [any unilateral liberation is flawed]{.underline}, and the
worst mistake would be to believe their mutual dependence
automatic:\'\'5 On these grounds he argues that the problem of [racism
cannot be solved on a psychological level. It is not]{.underline} an
**[\"individual\"]{.underline}** problem; [it is]{.underline} a

The city of Baltimore was rocked by protests and riots over the death of
Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African American man who died in police
custody. Tragically, Gray's death was only one of a recent in a series
of racially-charged, often violent, incidents. On April 4th, Walter
Scott was fatally shot by a police officer after fleeing from a routine
traffic stop. On March 8th, Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity members were
caught on camera gleefully chanting, "There Will Never Be A N\*\*\*\*\*
In SAE." [On March 1st, a homeless Black man was shot in broad daylight
by a Los Angeles police officer. And these are not isolated incidents,
of course. Institutional and systemic racism reinforce discrimination in
countless situations, including hiring, sentencing, housing, and even
mortgage lending. [It would be easy to see]{.mark} in all this powerful
[evidence that racism]{.mark} [is]{.mark} a [permanent]{.mark} fixture
in America's social fabric [and]{.mark} even, perhaps, an
[inevitable]{.mark} aspect of human nature. Indeed, the mere act of
labeling others according to their age, gender, or race is a reflexive
habit of the human mind. Social categories, like race, impact our
thinking quickly, often outside of our awareness]{.underline}. Extensive
research has found that these implicit racial biases---negative thoughts
and feelings about people from other races---are automatic, pervasive,
and difficult to suppress. Neuroscientists have also explored racial
prejudice by exposing people to images of faces while scanning their
brains in fMRI machines. Early studies found that when people viewed
faces of another race, the amount of activity in the amygdala---a small
brain structure associated with experiencing emotions, including
fear---was associated with individual differences on implicit measures
of racial bias. This work has led many to conclude that racial biases
might be part of a primitive---and possibly hard-wired---neural fear
response to racial out-groups. There is little question that categories
such as race, gender, and age play a major role in shaping the biases
and stereotypes that people bring to bear in their judgments of others.
[However, research has shown that [how people categorize themselves
may]{.mark} [be]{.mark} just as [fundamental to]{.mark} understanding
[prejudice]{.mark} as how they categorize others. When people categorize
themselves as part of a group, their self-concept shifts from the
individual ("I") to the collective level ("us"). People form groups
rapidly and favor members of their own group even when groups are formed
on arbitrary grounds, such as the simple flip of a coin. These findings
highlight the remarkable ease with which humans form coalitions. Recent
research confirms that [coalition]{.mark}-based [preferences trump
race]{.mark}-based preferences. For example, [both Democrats and
Republicans]{.mark} [favor]{.mark} the resumes of those affiliated with
[their]{.mark} political [party]{.mark} much [more than]{.mark} they
favor those who share [their race]{.mark}. These coalition-based
preferences remain powerful even in the absence of the animosity present
in electoral politics. Our research has shown that the simple act of
[placing people on a mixed-race team can diminish]{.mark} their
[automatic]{.mark} racial [bias.]{.mark} In a series of experiments,
White participants who were randomly placed on a mixed-race team---the
Tigers or Lions---showed little evidence of implicit racial
bias]{.underline}. [Merely [belonging to a mixed-race team trigged
positive automatic associations]{.mark} with all of the members of their
own group, irrespective of race[.]{.mark} Being a part of one of these
seemingly trivial mixed-race groups produced similar effects on brain
activity---[the amygdala responded to team]{.mark} membership [rather
than race]{.mark}. Taken together, these studies indicate that momentary
changes in group membership can override the influence of race on the
way we see, think about, and feel toward people who are different from
ourselves]{.underline}. Although these coalition-based distinctions
might be the most basic building block of bias, they say little about
the other factors that cause group conflict. Why do some groups get
ignored while others get attacked? Whenever we encounter a new person or
group we are motivated to answer two questions as quickly as possible:
"is this person a friend or foe?" and "are they capable of enacting
their intentions toward me?" In other words, once we have determined
that someone is a member of an out-group, we need to determine what
kind? The nature of the relations between groups---are we cooperative,
competitive, or neither?---and their relative status---do you have
access to resources?---largely determine the course of intergroup
interactions. Groups that are seen as competitive with one's interests,
and capable of enacting their nasty intentions, are much more likely to
be targets of hostility than more benevolent (e.g., elderly) or
powerless (e.g., homeless) groups. This is one reason why sports
rivalries have such psychological potency. For instance, fans of the
Boston Red Sox are more likely to feel pleasure, and exhibit
reward-related neural responses, at the misfortunes of the archrival New
York Yankees than other baseball teams (and vice versa)---especially in
the midst of a tight playoff race. (How much fans take pleasure in the
misfortunes of their rivals is also linked to how likely they would be
to harm fans from the other team.) Just as a particular person's group
membership can be flexible, so too are the relations between groups.
Groups that have previously had cordial relations may become rivals (and
vice versa). [Indeed, psychological and biological [responses to
out-group members can change]{.mark}, depending on whether or not that
out-group is perceived as threatening. For example, people exhibit
greater pleasure---they smile---in response to the misfortunes of
stereotypically competitive groups (e.g., investment bankers); however,
this malicious pleasure is reduced when you provide participants with
counter-stereotypic information (e.g., "investment bankers are working
with small companies to help them weather the economic
downturn).]{.underline} Competition between "us" and "them" can even
distort our judgments of distance, making threatening out-groups seem
much closer than they really are. These distorted perceptions can serve
to amplify intergroup discrimination: the more different and distant
"they" are, the easier it is to disrespect and harm them. [Thus, not all
out-groups are treated the same: some elicit indifference whereas others
become targets of antipathy. Stereotypically threatening groups are
especially likely to be targeted with violence, but those [stereotypes
can be tempered with other info]{.mark}rmation. [If]{.mark} perceptions
of intergroup relations can be changed, [individuals]{.mark} may
[overcome hostility]{.mark} toward perceived foes [and become more
responsive]{.mark} to one another's grievances. [The flexible
nature]{.mark} of both group membership and intergroup relations [offers
reason to be]{.mark} cautiously [optimistic about]{.mark} the potential
for greater [coop]{.mark}eration [among groups in conflict]{.mark} (be
they black versus white or citizens versus police). [One strategy is to
bring]{.mark} multiple [groups together around a common
goal]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, during the fiercely contested
2008 Democratic presidential primary process, Hillary Clinton and Barack
Obama supporters gave more money to strangers who supported the same
primary candidate (compared to the rival candidate). Two months later,
after the Democratic National Convention, the supporters of both
candidates coalesced around the party nominee---Barack Obama---and this
bias disappeared. [In fact, merely [creating]{.mark} a sense of
[cohesion]{.mark} between two competitive groups [can increase
empathy]{.mark} for the suffering of our rivals. [These]{.mark} sorts of
strategies can help [reduce aggression toward]{.mark} hostile
[out-groups,]{.mark} [which is critical for]{.mark} creating more
opportunities for [constructive dialogue addressing]{.mark} greater
social [injustices.]{.mark}]{.underline} Of course, instilling a sense
of common identity and cooperation is extremely difficult in entrenched
intergroup conflicts, but when it happens, the benefits are obvious.
Consider how the community leaders in New York City and Ferguson
responded differently to protests against police brutality---in NYC
political leaders expressed grief and concern over police brutality and
moved quickly to make policy changes in policing, whereas the leaders
and police in Ferguson responded with high-tech military vehicles and
riot gear. In the first case, multiple groups came together with a
common goal---to increase the safety of everyone in the community; in
the latter case, the actions of the police likely reinforced the "us"
and "them" distinctions. Tragically, these types of conflicts continue
to roil the country. Understanding the psychology and neuroscience of
social identity and intergroup relations cannot undo the effects of
systemic racism and discriminatory practices; however, it can offer
insights into the psychological processes responsible for escalating the
tension between, for example, civilians and police officers. Even in
cases where it isn't possible to create a common identity among groups
in conflict, it may be possible to blur the boundaries between groups.
In one recent experiment, we sorted participants into groups---red
versus blue team---competing for a cash prize. Half of the participants
were randomly assigned to see a picture of a segregated social network
of all the players, in which red dots clustered together, blue dots
clustered together, and the two clusters were separated by white space.
The other half of the participants saw an integrated social network in
which the red and blue dots were mixed together in one large cluster.
Participants who thought the two teams were interconnected with one
another reported greater empathy for the out-group players compared to
those who had seen the segregated network. Thus, reminding people that
individuals could be connected to one another despite being from
different groups may be another way to build trust and understanding
among them. A mere month before Freddie Gray died in police custody,
President Obama addressed the nation on the 50th anniversary of Bloody
Sunday in Selma: "We do a disservice to the cause of justice by
intimating that bias and discrimination are immutable, or that racial
division is inherent to America. To deny...progress -- our progress --
would be to rob us of our own agency; our responsibility to do what we
can to make America better.\" The president was saying that we, as a
society, have a responsibility to reduce prejudice and discrimination.
These recent findings from psychology and neuroscience indicate that we,
as individuals, possess this capacity. Of course this capacity is not
sufficient to usher in racial equality or peace. Even when the level of
prejudice against particular out-groups decreases, it does not imply
that the level of institutional discrimination against these or other
groups will necessarily improve. [Ultimately, [only collective action
and institutional evolution can address systemic racism]{.mark}. [The
science is clear]{.mark} on one thing, though: [individual bias and
discrimination are changeable]{.mark}. [Race-based prejudice]{.mark} and
discrimination, in particular, [are created and reinforced by]{.mark}
many [social factors,]{.mark} but they are [not inevitable consequences
of]{.mark} our [biology]{.mark}. Perhaps understanding how coalitional
thinking impacts intergroup relations will make it easier for us to
affect real social change going forward.]{.underline}

## Pessimism Bad

#### Their account of hope [overgeneralizes]{.underline} -- they are right about the problem with absolute faith in the government, but that's not our argument -- a [pragmatic]{.underline} understanding of hope as [inseparable from political life]{.underline} is [necessary]{.underline} to mobilize activism and prefigurative politics

[What ought I hope for? This question guides]{.underline} our [pursuit
of the good life]{.underline} and its answer is often shaped by our
social, political, and educational experiences. [We aren't born
with]{.underline} ready-made [hopes]{.underline}; rather, [we shape them
through]{.underline} our [interactions]{.underline} with others, our
growing sense of what is possible as [we learn]{.underline} about our
environment, and [our experiments with the world to see what we can do
within it and to change it]{.underline}. Other [people play an important
role]{.underline} in this process, [especially through institutions like
schools]{.underline}, social arrangements like families, and political
practices like democracy. [They shape the traditions and
expectations]{.underline} we inherit, as well as the ways in which we
test, challenge, and revise what has been passed on to us. Despite this,
[[hope is]{.mark} too often [described in individualist terms that
**fail to encapsulate** the full]{.mark} **process** of hoping and its
[potential impact]{.mark} on shared living]{.underline}. [Many
**theologians** link hope with]{.underline} an individual's [faith in a
deity]{.underline} who will act on his or her behalf, 1 [some
philosophers employ a **narrow understanding** of hope as an
individual's desire for an outcome in the face of
uncertainty]{.underline}, 2 while many more psychologists describe hope
as an individual's use of willpower and "waypower" to achieve clear
goals. 3 [Instead, [I]{.mark}]{.underline} will [[offer a **pragmatist
account** of hope]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is [firmly [rooted
in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[experiences]{.underline}]{.mark} of
individuals [[and grows out of real life circumstances, yet cannot be
disconnected from social and political life]{.underline}]{.mark}. 4 I
extend my account to show how [a pragmatist view of hope is necessarily
connected [to]{.mark} other people and can]{.underline} be used to
[enrich our experiences in communities]{.underline}. Moreover, [such
[hope can help us to **better face**]{.mark} **current [political
struggles and social problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, all the while
building a democratic identity together. 5 In this article, I will
explain how [[pragmatism offers an enhanced understanding of
hope]{.underline}]{.mark} and its role in our lives together. To examine
the ways in which shared hoping and the shared content of our hopes
shape our identity and our work together in democracy, I consider both
how and what we hope. [[Unlike]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[accounts of
hope that are **largely divorced from life's circumstances**, such as
**theological accounts**]{.mark} that [direct our attention to
deities]{.mark}]{.underline} and psychological accounts [that [tell us
we must hope for our goals regardless of real world
constraints]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[pragmatist hope is]{.mark}
noteworthy because it is firmly rooted in reality]{.underline}. 6
Moreover, [a pragmatist account addresses]{.underline} some of the
[current obstacles]{.underline} we face [in American democracy and is
**[capable of transforming or improving]{.mark}** them]{.underline}.
Perhaps more importantly, [such hope can be directly and indirectly
cultivated within citizens]{.underline}, thereby [offering a feasible
way that democratic life can be strengthened]{.underline}. 1 Present
Context Before looking at hope in detail, let's briefly first take stock
of current conditions that relate to hopelessness in personal and
political life. In pragmatist spirit, the account I offer here must
attend to real conditions. Unfortunately, these are conditions where
hope is struggling, where democracy may be in jeopardy, and where the
dominant form of hope that we do see is largely privatized. To begin, a
recent study using the World Values Survey and other polling sources
finds that democratic [[citizens have]{.underline} "[become more cynical
about]{.underline}]{.mark} [the value of democracy]{.underline} as a
political system, [less hopeful that anything they do might influence
public [policy, and]{.mark} more [willing to]{.mark} express
**[support]{.mark} for [authoritarian
alternatives]{.mark}**]{.underline}." 7 [Those citizens have
increasingly [**withdrawn** from democratic participation]{.mark},
whether that be through formal institutions or alternatives in the
public or civic spheres]{.underline}, such as joining in movements or
protests. There has been a dramatic shift in how the wealthy view
democracy, with 16 percent of them now believing that military rule is a
better way of living and an astounding 35 percent of rich young
Americans holding such a view. 8 There are likely many factors impacting
this current state of affairs and I will touch on a few here. 9 First,
in terms of hope most overtly, Alan Mittleman rightly notes that "[the
legitimacy of politics is damaged in proportion to its failure to fulfil
the hopes it has engendered]{.underline}." 10 Indeed, several recent
American candidates ran on messages of hope and yet the visions evoked
have often failed to be fulfilled in reality, crushing the heightened
expectations of citizens. [Politicians often use the rhetoric of hope,
but they tend to distort what hope really is and what it requires of
citizens]{.underline}, as I will explain later. Instead, they make
reference to the supposed destiny of the nation with God as its backer.
Or, as in the cases of Barack Obama and Donald Trump, some citizens
place their hope in the leader himself, invoking a messianic figure.
These forms of hope entail no more citizen action than, perhaps,
donating to a campaign or wearing an iconic t-shirt proclaiming "hope."
Instead, I will argue that, rather than passively relying on the hope
promised by politicians, citizens must participate in shaping and
fulfilling hope, making such hope more genuine and robust. Second,
[structural violence and inequality, common amongst poor and racial
minority communities in America, has wreaked havoc on hope]{.underline}.
[[In some cases]{.underline}]{.mark}, it has eroded hope. 11 In others
[[it has rendered hope exhausting]{.underline}]{.mark}, 12

of [hope that is more **sustainable** and more **attuned** to the real
conditions of life]{.mark} that we can control and others where we have
limited control]{.underline}. Third, [citizenship]{.underline} in
America [has increasingly become centered on individuals]{.underline},
personal responsibility, entrepreneurship, and private success.
[Historical accounts of rugged individualism]{.underline} have now
[joined forces with calls to educate children in grit and
expectations]{.underline} that one will fight [to earn one's
position]{.underline} and goods [in a competitive
marketplace]{.underline}. 14 [This environment lacks trust in others and
discourages collaborative effort]{.underline}. [Often those who have not
been successful]{.underline} in the past, or do not see viable avenues
for being so in the future, [**fatalistically accept** these conditions
and become passive about countering or changing them]{.underline}.
[While others who have enough resources and power]{.underline} to be
comfortable with the present conditions, [indulge in the privilege of
being cynical or apathetic]{.underline}. [[Some spread]{.mark} these
states of [hopelessness]{.mark}]{.underline} or jaded negativity
[through memes]{.underline} and messages on social media, [especially
about the role and effectiveness of government, **rendering
[cynicism]{.mark} a collective practice**]{.underline}. 15 [Cynics, left
believing that their political efforts are useless or ineffective and
perhaps that everyone acts on self-interest, are left to look out merely
for themselves, without a sense of responsibility to act on behalf of
themselves and others]{.underline}. Indeed, [cynics may mock others who
do not hold such views as naïve and out of touch with
reality]{.underline}. [Cynicism [functions as a **distancing
maneuver**,]{.mark} separating [citizen]{.mark}s from each other, from
formal democratic institutions, and from civic [organizations,]{.mark}
where visions of an improved world and action to achieve it tend to
occur]{.underline}. [My notion of hope aims to span those
divides]{.underline}. Finally, [what is left of hope has become
**privatized**]{.underline}. 16 [This is exacerbated as
neoliberalism]{.underline} continues to assert Margaret [Thatcher's
claims, "There is no such thing as society, only individuals and
families," and "there is no alternative to the market."]{.underline}
[Hope is reduced to a mere drive to achieve one's own limited
dreams]{.underline}, or those of one's children, typically only through
financial terms and material goods. When citizens are rendered isolated
competitors, [they [lose]{.mark} the [**ability to detect social
problems** and]{.mark} the **[motivation to ameliorate them]{.mark}**,
especially if the effects on one's self]{.underline} or family [are not
immediate]{.underline}. Economist Tyler Cowen describes these citizens
as [the new "complacent class,"]{.underline} who are
[content]{.underline} with the way things are as long as they are not
directly harmed and as long [as they can stay surrounded by people and
things that confirm their experience of the world]{.underline}. In their
complacency, the members of the complacent class are unable to "inspire
an electorate with any kind of strong positive visions, other than some
marginal adjustments." 17 I aim to show how hope is better understand as
a social and political endeavor that brings us into contact with others
as we craft visions of the future. In sum, [these changes in citizens'
lives and views **debilitate individual citizens and democracy as a
whole**]{.underline}. [They keep us from recognizing and solving
collective problems and from leading better lives together]{.underline}.
Citizens sit around waiting for reasons to hope, sometimes becoming
swept up in campaign rhetoric when election cycles come around, rather
than acknowledging that [hope is generated through action as subjects
working together]{.underline}, as I will argue. I will turn now to
depict a [pragmatist]{.underline} account of [hope]{.underline} that
[can be]{.underline} formally [cultivated in schools and]{.underline}
informally in [our lives together]{.underline}---a way of hoping
together [that may better support democratic life in these challenging
times]{.underline}. 2 Pragmatist Hope I offer here a pragmatist account
of hope, largely based in the philosophy of John Dewey. Notably, Dewey
himself does not provide such an account, even though hope underlies
much of his work and was evident in his own personal life as he
encountered considerable despair at the loss of two of his children and
his wife, while also facing two world wars. I construct a view of hope
from Dewey's well-articulated elements of inquiry, growth, truth,
meliorism, and habits. [[Pragmatism begins with the real and complicated
conditions of our world]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It brings together
intelligent reflection with inquiry, habits, and action]{.mark} so that
we can understand and change our environments to better align with our
needs and desires]{.underline}. [[Hope plays an important role]{.mark}
in that process]{.underline}. Inquiry, Growth, and Truth For Dewey,
[hope]{.underline} often [arises within the midst of despair, when we
have lost our way and are struggling to move forward]{.underline}.
[Dewey describes these moments as "indeterminate
situations."]{.underline} He turns to the process of inquiry via the
empirical method to help us explore those situations, consider possible
courses of action, and test out various solutions. It is inquiry that
helps us to understand, act upon, and reconstruct our environments and
our experiences so that we are able to move forward out of the
indeterminate situation. In a richly cognitive and often social
practice, [inquiry invokes curiosity and problem solving to move us out
of ruts]{.underline}. Indeed, [[this method **combats the stagnation of
fatalism** by urging us to **formulate and try out
solutions**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Growth describes how reconstructions
of our experiences through inquiry develops physical, intellectual, and
moral capacities, actualizing them and helping them inform one another
so that they continue in a chain that enables one to **live
satisfactorily**]{.underline}. [We **grow** when we learn from inquiry
into indeterminate situations [and]{.mark} **create ways to
[re-establish smooth living]{.mark}** that carries us from one activity
to the next]{.underline}. [Many people **wrongly assume** that
growth]{.underline} necessarily [has an **end**]{.underline}---as if it
were "movement toward a fixed goal." 18 We tend to think of growth as
only progression toward some specific outcome, such as mastering bicycle
riding or graduating from high school. [But this way of thinking tends
to place the emphasis on the static terminus, **rather** than focusing
on the **process** of growing as **itself educative and
worthwhile**]{.underline}. [Dewey's alternative view]{.underline} of
growth [does not neatly and linearly move toward a fixed
goal]{.underline}. [Instead,]{.underline} he describes
[trajectories]{.underline} that [are more complicated]{.underline},
often [shifting with the environment]{.underline}. Moreover, [holding
onto a fixed goal may be undesirable because doing so employs a limited
or possibly foreclosed vision of the future]{.underline}. Instead, [as
changes occur in one's environment]{.underline}, Dewey asserts that
[people must continually inquire into moments of uncertainty and
changing circumstances, develop new hypotheses about those situations,
and revise their aims]{.underline}. Dewey works with what he calls
["ends-in-view," which are relatively close and feasible, even if
difficult to achieve, rather than overarching goals at some final
endpoint in the future]{.underline}. Those ends-in-view guide our
decisions and hypotheses along the way, [keeping us resourceful in the
present]{.underline}. In Dewey's words, the discovery of how things do
occur makes it possible to conceive of their happening at will, and
gives us a start on selecting and combining the conditions, the means,
[to command their happening]{.underline}...[there must be a realistic
study of actual conditions and the mode or law of natural
event]{.underline}, in order [to give the imagined or ideal object
definite form and solid substance]{.underline}---to give it, in short,
[practicality and constitute it as a working end]{.underline}. 19 For
Dewey, [ends and means are intelligently considered in **light of each
other**, with both being **revisable**, and neither **abstracted** from
the other]{.underline}. [Each fulfilled end-in-view sustains our hope by
highlighting meaningful headway and directing our further
action]{.underline}. [Ends-in-view later become means to future ends,
working in an ongoing continuum]{.underline}. [[This **sustenance of
hope** differs from theological accounts which are **difficult to
sustain** on faith alone]{.mark} and may leave believers **frustrated**
at an apparent lack of action or improvement]{.underline}. It also
differs from positive psychology and grit literature which tends to
focus on large, far-off, and challenging goals that one holds
tenaciously. [Many people think of hope as goal-directed and
future-oriented]{.underline}. [While objects of hope for pragmatists may
temporarily serve as ends-in-view, the practice of hope moves us forward
through inquiry and experimentation as we pursue our complicated
trajectory]{.underline}. [It helps to unify our past, present, and
future]{.underline}. [Hope]{.underline}, then, [is not just about a
vision of the future, but rather a way of living in the present that is
informed by the past and what is anticipated to come]{.underline}.
[Whereas utopian views of what could be may actually immobilize one and
may exhaust one in the present, **[pragmatist hope is always tied to
what one]{.mark} is doing and [feasibly can do in the present]{.mark}**,
especially when equipped with knowledge of the past]{.underline}.
Central to pragmatist philosophy, [ideas become true insofar as they
"work" for us, fruitfully combine our experiences, and lead us to
further experiences that satisfy our needs]{.underline}. [Pragmatists
are concerned with the concrete differences in our lived experiences
that an idea's being true will make]{.underline}. [Pragmatic truth
expresses "the successful completing of a worthwhile
leading."]{.underline} 20 Unlike truth as a corresponding match between
proposition and reality, [pragmatist truth]{.underline} is something
that [occurs when the goals of human flourishing are
satisfied]{.underline}, at least temporarily. Built into these criteria
is consideration of the well-being of others, for successful leading
through experiences almost always necessarily requires working and
communicating with others. Additionally, the differences an idea will
make are quite limited, and therefore less truthful, if relevant only to
one person. While not a comprehensive vision of the good life, [certain
norms including equality and just communication are entailed both in
these deliberations and the determination of truth]{.underline}. 21 We
must consider how to flourish alongside others as we craft our
ends-in-view. This differs considerably from other philosophical and
psychological accounts of hope based on the desire of objects or states
of affairs regardless of whether they are good for us or other people.
Meliorism Pragmatists like Dewey recognize the difficulty of present
circumstances, yet approach them practically, rather than
idealistically, with thoughtful action, believing that circumstances can
be improved. 22 Unlike simple optimists, however, they do not hold that
the situation will necessarily work out for the best, but rather they
believe people should make efforts to contribute to better outcomes.
Such efforts are rarely undertaken alone, instead they are tied to
others who are working together to solve problems. In the words of
contemporary pragmatist Cornel West, "Optimism adopts the role of the
spectator who surveys the evidence in order to infer that things are
going to get better. Yet when we know that the evidence does not look
good...Hope enacts the stance of the participant who actively struggles
against the evidence." 23 Meliorism entails action in the face of
difficulties. [Dewey sees hope as a way of living aligned with
meliorism, "the idea that at least there is a sufficient basis of
goodness in life and its conditions so that by thought and earnest
effort we may constantly make better things."]{.underline} 24
[[Meliorism is **not a belief in inevitable progress**, but]{.mark}
rather [a call to]{.mark} human [action, especially in the midst of
struggle and uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}. Dewey firmly argued that
[it would be foolish to believe that there is "an automatic and
wholesale progress in human affairs,"]{.underline} insisting instead
that [betterment "depends upon **deliberative human foresight** and
**socially constructive work**."]{.underline} 25 Martin Luther King, a
champion and practitioner of hope, was enshrined on the floor of Obama's
oval office with his phrase: "The arc of the moral universe is long, but
it bends toward justice." Importantly, given how many hopes fell flat
under the messianic figure of Obama, King later explained in a
pragmatist spirit of meliorism, "[[Human progress never rolls on wheels
of inevitability; it comes through the **tireless
efforts**]{.underline}]{.mark} of men willing to be co-workers with God,
and [without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces
of social stagnation]{.underline}. [[We must **use time
creatively**]{.mark}, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to
do right]{.underline}." 26 We cannot wait until we have a clear picture
of our final future goals; rather, [we must act now in intelligent ways
and through inquiry [to bring about better conditions and]{.mark},
thereby,]{.underline} truth. [27 And we must [be]{.mark} flexible to
change and redirect our efforts as they unfold]{.underline}. [Meliorism
is [an **alternative to both pessimism and
optimism**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [It cultivates
**hope**]{.underline}]{.mark}[, **growth**, [and **better
worlds**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For some pragmatists, like Colin Koopman,
this meliorism-based hope is "[the pragmatist affect par
excellence]{.underline}: '[hope is the **mood of
meliorism**]{.underline}' (27), '[the characteristic attitude of
pragmatism is hope']{.underline} (17)." 28

#### Racial pessimism is the political view of Clarence Thomas -- their strategy reinforces a nihilistic, pull yourself up by your bootstraps view that can never embrace social progress

**Illing and Robin, 19** \[Corey Robin is an American political
theorist, journalist and professor of political science at Brooklyn
College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. Sean
Illing is the Interviews Writer for Vox. Before publishing things on the
Internet, he taught politics and philosophy at a university. Before
that, he served in the United States Air Force. The racial pessimism of
Clarence Thomas\]

- The way this kind of goes beyond cede the political is in the idea
  that -- if you go far enough left, you end up back on the right -- and
  so, Clarence Thomas can oppose school integration, prison reform etc.
  all because of his foundational nihilism

Sean Illing One of the strangest parts of all this is the fact that
[[Thomas has managed to preserve his]{.mark} core [black nationalist
beliefs]{.mark} on the court [while]{.mark} at the same time, as you put
it, "[remaining a hero to some of the most racist elements of the
American polity]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark} Is this just a case of
his supporters not bothering to understand what he actually thinks and
why he thinks it? Or do many of them understand it and just don't care?
Corey Robin I think they haven't bothered to understand what he thinks.
It's clear that most white conservatives just don't see it. Even the
best scholarship on the right just doesn't touch this dimension of
Thomas's thought, at least not as far as I can tell. And this continues
to be part of the paradox of Clarence Thomas. He's probably the most
well-known member of the court, everybody knows who he is, and yet no
one really knows who he is. Sean Illing I think this is true on the left
as well, but we'll get to that. First I'd like to ask you how these
background assumptions structure Thomas's judicial philosophy. One of
the contradictions you explore in the book is the fact that Thomas is an
avowed originalist, someone committed to applying the Constitution as it
was adopted in 1789, and yet he acknowledges that that Constitution was
written by and for slaveholders. Corey Robin Well, the first thing I'd
say is that Thomas's originalism is pretty inconsistent, but let's not
get into the weeds on that. [Here's why I think originalism is important
to Thomas and it's partly for the reason you just mentioned: He sees it
as a kind of permanent reminder of the constraints written into the
Constitution under which African Americans have labored for over three
centuries. Thomas sees value in this, and he's very upfront about
it]{.underline}. It would be too strong to say that he would like to
rewrite the Constitution as if it were a Jim Crow Constitution, but he
really does believe in his heart of hearts that black people,
particularly black men, flourished under the heavy yoke of subjugation
that was Jim Crow. And this is where his ideology is pretty
straightforwardly conservative: he believes that under the conditions of
extreme hardship, the strongest wills have a way of bashing their way
through those constraints in order to overcome them, and he thinks this
is what the African American community did when it was oppressed by the
white majority. Sean Illing You say that "the story of Clarence Thomas
is the story of the last half century of American politics and the long
shadow of defeat that hangs over it." This gets at the sense of racial
despair a lot of people --- on the left and right --- feel right now. As
the gains of the civil rights movement are eroding, as white nationalism
subsumes the White House, it's hard not to sympathize with Thomas's
pessimism about the possibilities of political progress. Is that how you
feel after writing this book?Corey Robin I didn't need Clarence Thomas
to convince me that the gains of the civil rights movement and the black
freedom struggle had been cut back in a big way --- that movement has
been in reverse motion for quite some time. But [engaging with Thomas
did clarify for me how strong this [ambient mood of racial
despair]{.mark} is right now, and I think [many people on the left think
that that signifies the mark of progressive values]{.mark}.]{.underline}
But I don't think that's true at all. [The beginning of the left
tradition ---]{.underline} and I say this as someone on the left --- [is
the [recognition that oppression can be undone]{.mark} and transformed.
[Oppression is]{.mark} the product of [politics and it can be dismantled
through politics]{.mark} --- we risk forgetting this when we become
overly pessimistic.]{.underline} I hope [wrestling with [Thomas's
conservatism opens up]{.mark} a [discussion]{.mark} across the country
[about where]{.mark} we think racial [pessimism
leads]{.mark}]{.underline} necessarily. [Identifying the structures of
oppression is critical, but it's only constructive if we also identify
the vulnerabilities of those structures]{.underline}. This is the job of
the left and we'll lose if we cease to do it.

#### Reject fatalism -- devaluing political engagement reinforces self-hatred and precludes positive coalitional politics, collapsing into white divide and conquer.

By disproving Wilderson's claim that the Black Body is in a perpetual
state of ontological death because of the violence of the Middle Passage
and showing that the Black Body is not socially dead, then [the
possibilities of]{.underline} legal [**reform** and **coalitional
politics** become]{.underline} possible and [desirable]{.underline}. For
Wilderson, coalitional politics are just attempts to feign the
ontological capacity of Blacks to shape their own future. He refers to
white people and colored immigrants specifically who try to engage in
coalitional politics with the Black Body as "the junior and senior
partners of civil society" who pretend as if the Black is coherent and
human. (Wilderson, Red, White and Black, pg. 39). It is this kind of
ontological absolutism that Wilderson adheres to that David Marriott
criticizes when he writes, "Wilderson is prepared [[to say]{.mark} that
[black suffering]{.mark}]{.underline} is not only beyond analogy, it
also [[refigures the whole of being]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is not hard
when reading such sentences to suspect a kind of absolutism at work
here, and one that [[manages to be]{.underline}]{.mark} peculiarly and
**[[dispiritingly dogmatic]{.underline}]{.mark}**: throughout Red,
White, and Black, despite variations in tone and emphasis, there is
always the desire [[to have **black**]{.mark} **lived experience**
[named as the worst]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the politics of such a
desire inevitably [[collapses into]{.underline}]{.mark} a kind of
[**[sentimental moralism]{.mark}**: for the claim that 'Blackness is
incapacity]{.underline} in its most pure and unadulterated form'
[means]{.underline} merely that [the black has to embody this abjection
without reserve]{.underline} (p. 38). This logic---and [[the denial
of]{.mark} any]{.underline} kind of ['[ontological
integrity']{.mark}]{.underline} to the Black/Slave due to its endless
traversal by force [does seem to [**reduce ontology**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} logic, namely, [a logic of
non-[recuperabili]{.mark}ty."]{.underline} (Mariott, Black Cultural
Studies, pg. 37-66). [Wilderson's]{.underline} insistence of
[[**absolute negativity** destroys]{.mark} the possibility for
[coalitional politics because it will]{.mark}]{.underline} always
[[frame]{.underline}]{.mark} the Black Body [as something]{.underline}
that will [always]{.underline} stand [in [an **antagonistic
position**]{.mark} to the world]{.underline}. In engaging in this form
of ontological absolutism, [Wilderson]{.underline} effectively [creates
an \"us against the world" logic whereby its best to]{.underline} either
**[succumb to]{.underline}** the **[negativity]{.underline}**
surrounding the Black Body or destroy the world to free the Black Body.
Furthermore, as Mariott points out, [this dogmatic]{.underline}
ontological [[absolutism **essentializes**]{.mark} **the [Black
experience]{.mark}** to its most negative]{.underline} point, a kind of
[[negativity]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[reproduces]{.underline}]{.mark}
a form of [[**self-hatred** that]{.mark} contributes to the destruction
of positive]{.underline} coalitional [politics. When]{.underline} one
comes to [believe that they]{.underline} themselves [are ontologically
dead, [this encourages]{.mark}]{.underline} the logic of [[**political
apathy** where one refuses to]{.underline}]{.mark} attempt to [[engage
with **agents of change**]{.mark} because they curse their]{.underline}
own [identity and believe that there is nothing]{.underline} they can do
about their situation [because Blackness is]{.underline} an
[ontological]{.underline} condition. To put it in Lehman's term, "why go
vote if I'm socially dead?". [[This]{.mark} form of
**[disengagement]{.mark}**]{.underline} from the political [[**is
problematic** when racism is entrenched in]{.underline}]{.mark} our
[[law]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Ian Haney Lopez points out in his book
White By Law when he writes, ["law is implicated in]{.underline} the
construction of the contingent [social systems of meaning that
attach]{.underline} in our society to morphology and ancestry, the
meaning system we commonly refer to as [race. [The legal system
influences]{.mark}]{.underline} what we look like, the [meanings
ascribed to]{.underline} our looks[, and the [material reality that
confirms]{.mark}]{.underline} the meanings of [our [appearances. **Law
constructs race."**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lopez, White By Law, pg. 16).
[[If]{.mark} the [precedent set by court cases]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
Lopez points out, [[were responsible for]{.underline}]{.mark} creating
the precedents that shaped [how we see race as a [social
construction]{.mark}, then]{.underline} the need [to challenge racism
**through [legal reform]{.mark}** [becomes]{.mark}]{.underline} more
[[apparent]{.underline}]{.mark}. Wilderson's [ontological absolutism
destroys]{.underline} the possibility to form the kind of
[coalitions]{.underline} that are [necessary to]{.underline} engaging
with [the legal systems that use the law to shape]{.underline} our
[social perceptions of race]{.underline}. The kind of
**[[self-hatred]{.underline}]{.mark}** that Wilderson perpetuates
[through]{.underline} his [ontological construction]{.underline} of
Blackness [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} only [**[re-entrench
racism]{.mark}** because the Black Body will refuse to engage
in]{.underline} the forms of legal reform [necessary to
change]{.underline} the law and they way it shapes [how we view
race]{.underline} as a social construction. [If the law is
what]{.underline} truly [shapes]{.underline} the social construction of
[race]{.underline} and if the Black Body is truly capable of engaging
with these institutions, then Wilderson's Afro-[pessimism must
be]{.underline} firmly [rejected to usher in a politics]{.underline} of
hope that is necessary [to **mobilize coalitions** against]{.underline}
dominant [power structures]{.underline}. The idea of embracing a
politics of hope and solidarity is a concept that would seem absolutely
foreign to Wilderson. Indeed, with the recent events surrounding the
likes of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, the credibility surrounding the
Afro-pessimist school of thought is increasing. Yet it is precisely
these [events]{.underline} that [necessitate a politics of]{.underline}
hope and [solidarity]{.underline} that Gloria Jean Watkins, better known
by her pen name Bell Hooks, advocates for in her 1996 book Killing Rage:
Ending Racism when she writes, "Black Americans are succumbing to and
internalizing the racist assumption that there can be no meaningful
bonds of intimacy between blacks and whites. It is fascinating to
explore why it is that black people trapped in the worst situation of
racial oppression---enslavement---had the foresight to see that it would
be disempowering for them to lose sight of the capacity of white people
to transform themselves and divest of white supremacy, even as many
black folks today who in no way suffer such extreme racist oppression
and exploitation are convinced that white people will not repudiate
racism. Contemporary black folks, like their white counterparts, have
passively accepted the internalization of white supremacist assumptions.
Organized white supremacists have always taught that there can never be
trust and intimacy between the superior white race and the inferior
black race. [[When black people **internalize**]{.mark} **these
[sentiments]{.mark}**[, no resistance]{.mark} to white supremacy [is
taking place]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather [[we **become complicit**
in]{.mark} spreading [racist notions]{.mark}]{.underline}. It does not
matter that so many black people feel white people will never repudiate
racism because of being daily assaulted by white denial and refusal of
accountability. [We must not allow]{.underline} the actions of [white
folks who]{.underline} blindly [endorse racism to determine]{.underline}
the direction of [our resistance]{.underline}. Like our white allies in
struggle [we must consistently keep the faith]{.underline}, by always
sharing the truth that white people can be anti-racist, that racism is
not some immutable character flaw." (Bell Hooks, Killing Rage: Ending
Racism, pg. 269-270). Bell Hooks avoids falling into the colonial trap
of Wilderson by speaking for herself and her own experiences. By
acknowledging that there are many anti-racist whites, she has created a
space where Black folk who believe that they have a future can speak of
their own experiences and contribute to meaningful dialogue about how
[Black folk should take steps forward in]{.underline} the context of
[legal reform. Unlike [Wilderson]{.mark} who **[universalizes the Black
experience]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Bell [Hooks acknowledges that
internalizing racist assumptions]{.underline} of the Black Body, or in
the context of Wilderson, their own ontological construction,
[will]{.underline} only [give into White supremacy because]{.underline}
the cycle of [self-hatred creates a **sense of powerlessness** that
prevents the Black Body from ever getting out]{.underline} in the first
place. Furthermore, Wilderson's [ontological [absolutism is a **tactic
of White supremacy**]{.mark}, because]{.underline}, as pointed out by
Bell Hooks, [[it creates]{.underline}]{.mark} a sense of [[distrust that
plays into]{.mark} the **[divide and conquer]{.mark}**
mentality]{.underline} that is [crucial to White supremacy's
grip]{.underline} on society. For Bell Hooks, [[when the Black community
gives into]{.underline}]{.mark} its own [[pessimism]{.mark}, White
supremacists win because [there is no]{.mark}]{.underline} motivation
for [[resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the wake of recent events,
[[embracing a **politics of**]{.underline}]{.mark} hope and
[[**solidarity** is]{.underline}]{.mark} more
[[important]{.underline}]{.mark} than ever as racism begins to become
more apparent. Hope offers the crucial first step towards encouraging
the first steps towards resistance, a step that Wilderson's extreme
negativity prevents from ever been taken. [Instead of imagining the
end]{.underline} of the world, [we must imagine a]{.underline} world
with a [better future]{.underline}.

#### Permutation do both\-\--saving the Earth from its excesses is *[in line]{.underline}* with Black radical scholarship

**Moten and Kelley, 17**---professor of Performance Studies at New York
University AND Gary B. Nash Professor of American History at UCLA (Fred
and Robin D.G., "Robin D.G. Kelley & Fred Moten In Conversation,"
transcribed from <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP-2F9MXjRE>,
31:49-55:57, dml)

MOTEN: Well, first of all, I just want to say how much I appreciate
having a chance to be here with all of you tonight, and thank you,
Rinaldo, and, uh, Alicia, and Afua, of course. Robin, as always, uh, an
honor to be, have a chance to hang out with you, and uh, and to learn
from you, and um, let me see. Um, well, I tend to think of [Black
studies]{.underline} not so much as an academic discipline or confluence
of disciplines but as the atmosphere in which I grew up, and so, and I
love that, that atmosphere. I love the way that it felt, and I love the
way that it smelled, and I love the flavors, and I love the sounds, and
I love the movements. Um, and so, it is, again, something that I think
[has a **certain place**]{.underline}, maybe, **[in the
university]{.underline}**, and what it meant, what it has meant for
Black studies to take that place in the university has had both, has
been both good and bad. I think [it's probably done much more for the
university than it has for Black studies]{.underline}, and, and that's
something worth thinking about. And [I **don't say that because I'm
trying to advocate some withdrawal from the university of Black
studies**, but]{.underline} I'm thinking that, you know, that [at this
stage of the game in having done the work of attempting to]{.underline}
actually **[bring]{.underline}**, um, **[the university
into]{.underline}** some sense of its own, of what ought to be [**its
own intellectual mission**, [Black studies has the right to **look out
for itself now**]{.mark}]{.underline}, for a little bit, um, and I think
it's worth it to do that. [[And]{.mark} insofar as Black studies has
earned a right to look out for itself, what that really
means]{.underline}, I think, [is that Black studies [has]{.mark} earned
the right to try again to take its **[fundamental
responsibility]{.mark}**, which is [to]{.mark} be]{.underline}, uh, [a
place where we can **[look out for the Earth]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Um,
I think that [Black studies has a **fundamental** and **specific**,
though **not necessarily exclusive mission**, and that mission is to
**try to save the Earth**, or at least]{.underline} to try to save, not,
well, [on the **most fundamental level** to **save the Earth**,
[and]{.mark} on a secondary level, to try to **[save the possibility of
human existence]{.mark} on the Earth**]{.underline}. Um, and I know
that's a big statement, and I don't wanna take up all the time, but I'm
happy to try to say more about what I think I mean by that later on,
but, um, but I think maybe it's important just to leave that big
statement out there for a minute, and just to make sure that you know
that I knew that I said it when I said it. KELLEY: Okay, well, actually
I wanna echo, uh, Fred's sentiments, that it's really an honor to be
here, in this space. Um, this is the second time that we've had kind of
a public conversation, and it's always packed, you know, and it's always
a lot of people, and expectations are always high, and one of my
favorite things on the planet, besides just talking to my daughters,
talking to Fred Moten, um, you know, and it's just really, you know, I
learn so much from it, and in fact, let me just begin by saying that one
of the pieces that Rinaldo was referring to was an essay I wrote called,
uh, "Black Study, Black Struggle," which was entirely inspired by, uh,
Fred Moten and Stefano Harney's, uh, book, "The Undercommons." It was a
way of the application of the notion of the undercommons to
understanding what was happening at that moment, which in, in the fall
of 2015, there was like an explosion of, um, Black protests on, on
campus, and, you know, I won't repeat what's in the article, uh, but it,
it's not an accident that some of those struggles, uh, were products of
what was happening in the streets. In other words, what happened in
Ferguson, and what happened in Baltimore, what happened all over the
country, and what happened in places like here in Toronto, were the
catalyst for, um, a kind of explosion on campuses, where, uh, students
were trying to figure out their place in the university. They're dealing
with racism, and microaggressions on university campuses, uh, they're
dealing with a, a kind of deracinated, you know, curriculum where ethnic
studies wasn't what it was, in its inception. Um, and, I was also
dealing with, or [many of us were]{.underline} also [dealing
with]{.underline}, uh, a culture of, and I hate to put it this way, but
[a **culture of anti-intellectualism**]{.underline} in, in a different
sort of way. I mean, [universities are often anti-intellectual, in that
they]{.underline} actually [**disavow certain forms of knowledge** and
put other knowledge above that]{.underline}, which is an
anti-intellectual position by the way. Um, [but then when you're
assaulted by that all the time]{.underline}, uh, [sometimes you end up
**mirroring that culture**. And you're saying "well I'm not gonna read
this, I'm not gonna read that, because so-and-so wrote it," as opposed
to saying that there's **nothing off the table**]{.underline}, uh, [that
[Black studies]{.mark}]{.underline}, and Fred knows this 'cause he
repeats it more than I do, that our mutual, uh, teacher, Cedric
Robinson, who paraphrased C. L. R. James, said you know, Black studies
[[is a **critique of Western civilization**, and]{.mark} if that is the
case, then we **both** [have to **dismantle**]{.mark} **it**,
**recognize the weak edifice** upon which it's built, [but also **know
everything that's happening within it**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But
anyway, let me just back up, um, so, I just, so the three points I wanna
make in reference to the question, one is that, uh, social movements
have always been the catalyst for Black studies. When Fred was talking
about, you know, Black studies as, as, uh, kinda, kinda like a way of
life, as an atmosphere in which he grew up and which I grew up and many
of us grew up, that's so true. I never thought about it that way, but,
you know, that's so true. And in fact, um, if anything, Black Studies is
not a multidiscipline but a project, a project for liberation, whatever
that means, and [[liberation is]{.mark} an **ongoing
project**]{.underline}. Um, Ruthie Gilmore, uh, who was at USC, uh, with
me and Fred, had come up with this idea of renaming ethnic studies
"liberation studies." And, you know, we were actually serious about
that, we were like, trying to figure out how to do that, and never
filled it, but [it reminds us that]{.underline}, you know, it's not
about, um, [it's **not about a body**. It's **not about bodies**. It's
about **ideas**, and about the **future**]{.underline}, you know. [It's
[about **recognizing the past** and]{.mark} the **[construction of a new
future]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And so I think, in that respect, in order
to understand the future of Black studies, we gotta understand the
movements that produced it---that, that the Movement for Black Lives,
that, um, uh, We Charge Genocide, that Black Youth Projects 100---all
these struggles that erupted have, in fact, uh, pointed the way for
Black Studies. The problem is, is that what gets constituted as the
institutional space of Black studies, in many cases, isn't really that.
And I hate to bring people down, because we're supposed to be up, right?
But there are a lot of departments that I wouldn\'t call Black studies
departments that have that name, you know, there are a lot of, [there\'s
a lot of scholarship that goes on that has **no relationship at all** to
the **project of transformation**, or to **people**, to **actual people
in community**]{.underline}. And one of the important things to always
remember is that, um, we wouldn\'t have Black studies if it wasn\'t---in
the United States, that is, I\'m talking about the US---if it wasn\'t
for Watts, if it wasn\'t for Detroit in 67, and if it wasn\'t for those
kinds of urban rebellions, if it wasn\'t for the struggles in the South,
that\'s where [Black studies]{.underline} comes from. Uh, and so it
[moves into the university]{.underline} as a, [as a **transformative
project**]{.underline}. Um, it\'s not---[and that\'s why]{.underline} I
think [there was a **disconnect** between]{.underline} some of the, the
[protests and what was happening in the academy]{.underline}. Finally,
there's this question of, of ethnic studies versus, or against, or for,
or within or bedded in Black studies. And one of the things that, that I
think a lot of us are trying to figure out is to deepen the relationship
between indigenous studies and Black studies. Um, to understand that
this was what I call second wave ethnic studies in the 1990s was itself
a project that was, believe it or not, in a, a response to
neoliberalism. And I think we don\'t always see that because we, we tend
to read backwards in the 1990s and 1980s as, like, ethnic studies as
identity politics in the narrowest sense of the word, that somehow this
was about producing a sense of, of pride and a sense of identity devoid
of the question of power. But if you actually look at the struggles for
ethnic studies in the 80s and 90s, it was all about power. That, that
what we think of as comparative or critical ethnic studies was, wasn\'t
about the celebration of difference. It wasn\'t liberal
multiculturalism. It was an assault on a neoliberal turn. And we, we
sometimes forget that and, and, and then we write the history. And so I
think I want to at some point talk more about that, but I think that\'s
something to remember, because, right now, [if we don\'t have Black
studies as a **critique in response to the neoliberal neofascist turn**,
then it\'s]{.underline} sort of **[worthless]{.underline}**. You know,
[it\'s going to continue to exist. Maybe not in the academy
though]{.underline}. So I\'ll just stop there. WALCOTT: So, um, Robin,
where you ended, and, and where Fred began, it's a, is a good segue into
getting you, both of you, to talk about the work that you\'ve been doing
around questions of Palestinian struggle and freedom. Fred, the work
that, the tremendous work that you did in the ASA, um, American Studies
Association, for which the Association is still living true, and, and
Robin the work that you continue to do with um, um, with faculty for
Palestine. But I\'m thinking about Fred\'s provocation here that Black
studies about saving the Earth and if Black studies is indeed about
saving the Earth, which I\'m very willing to fall right into right now,
you know, first to kind of maybe think about this relationship between
the struggle and, and freedom of Palestine and the relationship between
ongoing settler colonialisms globally, because it seems to me that one
of the most powerful things that, um, the kind of Black studies that has
taken to the streets recently has done is to make those kinds of
concerns present, right? BLM visits to Palestine, BLM in Toronto, always
making sure that the invocation of the politics of settler colonialism
is a part of a political organizing, and, um, their intimate relations
with indigenous communities. So maybe this is a way for us to begin to
talk about what\'s really at stake in this contemporary political moment
where, um, or, or a radical politics, a politics that wants to think a
different kind of future formation, is grappling with, um, settler
colonialism in various kinds of ways. But Palestine being central to
that, given that we know as we sit in this university is that often, um,
what we call our senior administrators have an entirely different
relationship with the question of freedom for Palestine. MOTEN: Well,
um, first, I mean, the work I did around, um, you know, the ASA's, um,
you know, decision to endorse the academic and cultural boycott of
Israel was really minimal and minor compared to a lot of other people
who were really out front, um, and, and have been working tirelessly for
that for many, many years. Um, and I think, you know, the, my
contribution was more, you know, rhetorical in many ways in, in, in,
and, and maybe, maybe theoretical only in the most minimal sense, in the
sense that what I wanted to do was a couple of things. First, to
recognize that, um, you know, let\'s say that [the conditions of what
people call **modernity**]{.underline}, um, in, in, in, in, or global
modernity, that [the **fundamental conditions** that make that up
are]{.underline}, you know, [**settler colonialism**. And]{.underline} I
think [we can talk about settler colonialism in ways that are
**broader** than the normal way that we usually think of them as a **set
of violent** and **brutal relations** between Europe and the rest of the
world]{.underline}. Because I think it\'s really important. And, and,
and again, our, our mutual friend and mentor Cedric Robinson, pointed
this out emphatically, and in brilliant ways early on, that settler
colonialism is also an intra-European affair. Um, and it\'s important to
understand that. It\'s important to understand this historic
relationship between settler colonialism in the enclosure of the
commons, um, which is part and, part of the origins of, of what we now
know or understand as capitalism. But if we understand that [**settler
colonialism**, that the **transatlantic slave trade**]{.underline}, um,
[and]{.underline} that, you know, [the emergence of a **set of
philosophical formulations**]{.underline} that [essentially provide for
us **some modern conception of self** that has as its basis a kind of
**possessive**, **heteronormative**, **patriarchal individuation**,
right? That\'s **what it is to be yourself** on the **most fundamental
level**]{.underline}. You know, and if you ask anybody in the philosophy
department, they\'ll tell you that that\'s true, you know, and they
won't be joking, right, that, um, that, these, that these constitute the
basis of, of our modernity. But for most of the people who live in the
world, actually [for **everybody who lives in the world**, although most
of the people in live in the world are actually able to both recognize
this and say this, that modernity is a **social** and **ecological
disaster** that we live, that we now **attempt to
survive**]{.underline}. Okay? And if we take that up, then [part of
what\'s at stake is that we recognize that **feminist** and **queer
interventions against heteronormative patriarchy**, that **[Black
interventions against]{.mark} the theory** and **practice of
[slavery]{.mark}**, which is **ongoing**, that **indigenous
interventions against settler colonialism** [constitute the]{.mark}
general both [**practical** and **intellectual basis** for]{.mark} not
only our [**attempts to survive**, but also]{.mark} our attempts
to]{.underline}, as I said before, [**save the Earth**.]{.underline}
And, and I put it in terms that the great poet Ed Roberson puts it;
[**not just to save the Earth**, but to **[see the Earth before the end
of the world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And [this is an **emergency** that
we\'re in **now** and it\'s **urgent**]{.underline}. Um, and I believe
that [there's a **specific convergence** of black thought and indigenous
thought that situates itself **precisely in relation to**, and is
**articulated through**, the **interventions of queer thought** and
**feminist thought** that we want to take up]{.underline}. And, and it,
and it strikes me as, for me at least, it\'s, it\'s a way of taking up a
kind an---it\'s, [[it's a way of imagining]{.underline}]{.mark} how one
might be able to, [[how we might]{.mark} be able to **[walk]{.mark} more
[lightly on]{.mark} the [Earth]{.mark}**. To **honor the Earth** as we
walk on it, as we stand on it. [To **not stomp on it**]{.mark}, to **not
stomp all over it**, where **every step you take is a claim of
ownership**]{.underline}. And, and this is one way to put it, would be
to not so presumptuously imagine that the Earth can be reduced to
something so paltry and so viciously understood as what we usually call
home. This is part of the reason why the queer and the feminist critique
is so important. It\'s a critique of a general problematic notion of
domesticity. [It\'s like **another way of being on the Earth** that
**doesn\'t allow you** in some **vicious** and **brutal way** to claim
that it is yours]{.underline}, right? Um, this is important and this is
so, you know, often the methods that we use to claim the Earth as ours
involved fences, borders. This manifests itself on a private level from
household to household, but it also manifests itself on a national
level, and at the level of the nation state, and it\'s not an accident
that settler colonial states take it upon themselves to imagine
themselves to be the living embodiment of the legitimacy of the nation
state as a political and social form. For me, there\'s two reasons to be
in solidarity with the people of Palestine. One is because they\'re
human beings and they\'re being treated with absolute brutality, but the
other is that there\'s a specific resistance to Israel as a nation
state. And for my money, to be perfectly clear about this, I believe
that this nation state of Israel is itself an artifact of antisemitism.
If we thought about Israel and Zionism, not just as a form of racism
that results in the displacement of Palestinians, but if we also think
about them as artifacts of the historic displacement of Jews from
Europe, right, in the same way that we might think of, let\'s say Sierra
Leone or Liberia as artifacts of racist displacement, okay. If we think
about it that way, okay, and another, and the reason I\'m saying this is
just to make sure that you know that there\'s a possible argument
against the formulation that criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic when we
know that Donald Trump is a staunch supporter, that people like Pat
Robertson in the United States are staunch supporters that help us to
the fact that you can be deeply anti-Semitic and support the state of
Israel. These things go together. They\'re not antithetical to one
another. So that it becomes important for us to be able to suggest that
resistance to the state of Israel is also resistance to the idea of the
legitimacy of the nation state. It\'s not an accident that Israel has
taken upon itself, that when Israel takes upon itself, when the defense
of Israel manifests itself as a defense of its right to exist, this is
important. It\'s a defense, not just of Israel\'s right to exist, but of
the nation state as a political form's right to exist. And nation states
don\'t have rights. What they\'re supposed to be are mechanisms to
protect the rights of the people who live in them, and that has almost
never been the case, and to the extent that they do protect the rights
of the people who live in them, it\'s in the expense, it\'s at the
expense of the people who don\'t, okay. So part of what\'s at stake, one
of the reasons why it\'s at, it\'s important to pay particular attention
to this issue, why we ought to resist the ridiculous formulation that
singling out Israel at this moment is itself anti-Semitic is because
it\'s important to recognize that Israel is the state. \[KELLEY:
Right.\] MOTEN: For reasons that I think are totally bound up with
antisemitism, right? Israel is the state that, insofar as it makes the
claim about its right to exist, is also making the claim about the
nation state's right to exist as such. It\'s this, it\'s that same kind
of argument that, I remembered the---and I\'m sorry to keep going on so
long, but there\'s---there\'s those formulations that people often make
about Black people in it or indigenous people as if they were the
essence of the human, right, so that every time Black people or
indigenous people do something that supposedly we\'re not supposed to
do, it constitutes a violation to the very idea of the human. Right,
because somehow as a function of the nobility of our suffering, we
constitute the very idea of humanity, right? And there\'s nothing more
brutal, right? Nothing more vicious than having been being consigned to
that position. Similarly, Israel as a function of anti-Semitism has now
been placed in the position of protecting the very idea of the nation
state. So for me, first and foremost, it\'s important to have solidarity
with the Palestinian people, but second of all, it\'s important to
actually have some solidarity with the Jewish people insofar as they can
and must be separated from the Israeli state because ultimately the fate
of the Jewish people, if it is tied to this, to the nation state of
Israel, will be more brutal than anything that has yet been done or can
be imagined, and I mean everything that you think I mean when I say
that.

# Extinction / death bad

#### Voting for the status quo is anti-black, too -- evaluate [consequences]{.underline} before ethical alignments

This brings me to my second proposal about the source of the problem:
**[[it will not]{.underline}]{.mark}** I think **[[be possible
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** validate, **[understand, and thereby
[combat]{.mark} the various levels upon which [racism]{.mark} operates
[without finding a place in moral reasoning for outcomes as well as
intentions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Blum is attracted, for what I take to
be entirely sound reasons, **[to a non-consequentialist view of
morality]{.underline}**. On such a view, **[[unintended consequences
that are morally undesirable are unfortunate, but not wrong]{.mark} in a
strictly moral sense]{.underline}** of the term, unless closely
connected in some way to actual bad intentions. I share with Blum a
preference for this deontological approach to moral analysis, **[but [as
the persistence of]{.mark} structural [racism shows, we need some way to
admit]{.mark} the robust [moral significance even of unintended
consequences or]{.mark}]{.underline}** seriously **[[risk]{.mark} the
[irrelevance]{.mark} of our moral theory]{.underline}**. This is not as
difficult to do as it appears, for the idea that these two strains of
modern moral thought, consequentialism and deontology, are wholly
contradictory is more a product of 18th century intellectual politics
than of anything inherent in their moral insights; **[[admitting that
consequences matter morally need not involve capitulation to]{.mark} the
[slippery slope of util]{.mark}itarian calculation. One]{.underline}**
fairly **[inexpensive way to bridge the]{.underline}** imaginary **[gap
is]{.underline}** just **[to parse the utilitarian demand as a
deontological obligation]{.underline}** (and it need not even be the
highest of our prima facia duties): **[[one of our moral duties
is]{.mark} to live our lives]{.underline}**, within the limits of our
knowledge and ability, **[so as [to make the world]{.mark} a
[better]{.mark} and more just place [overall]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Simple as **[[this]{.underline}]{.mark}** seems, and easy to reconcile

**[[removes a bias in favor of the (oppressive]{.mark}, unjust,
[racist)]{.mark} social [s]{.mark}tatus [quo]{.mark}]{.underline}**
sometimes thought to characterize deontic moral theories. It also
revises the relation between individuals and their enabling communities
from accidental association to mutual obligation: social structures owe
individuals support, (relative) independence, and the best available
approximation of justice, whereas individuals in turn owe those same
social institutions the impetus for continual moral revitalization.

#### Critique despite [certain]{.underline} death reinscribes domination

The questions that Blanchot raises with respect to death\'s
possibilities only multiply as one addresses works of literature that
equate commodification with death. In Beatty\'s novel, the difficulties
of that risky proposition are nowhere more apparent than in the novel\'s
evocation of suicide as a national poetics. [Frustrated]{.underline}
simultaneously [by the absence of viable political alternatives for
black Americans and his own inability to slip the noose of
commodification, Gunnar]{.underline} inadvertendy [posits **black
suicide** as an option]{.underline}. This prospect comes about at Boston
University where Gunnar serves double duty as poet and basketball
celebrity. After being asked to give a speech at a divestment rally,
Gunnar laments, \"today\'s black leadership isn\'t worth shit.\" These
\"telegenic negroes not willing to die. Back in the old days, if someone
spoke up against the white man, he or she was willing to die\" (200).
Retooling one of Martin Luther King\'s civil rights era maxims, Gunnar
pronounces, \"I ain\'t ready to die for anything, so I guess I\'m just
not fit to live. In other words, **[I\'m just ready to
die]{.underline}**\" (200). [In [this]{.mark} articulation Gunnar
[acknowledges the impossibility of]{.mark} reviving]{.underline} the
modes of bodily sacrifice that [**[civil rights]{.underline}**]{.mark}
activists forged, [[and **begins to articulate suicide as an
alternative**]{.mark}. Gunnar]{.underline} eventually [proposes to
consolidate human agency]{.underline} and autonomy [by determining his
own death]{.underline}. He articulates this logic in a conversation with
his friend Psycho Loco who sees suicide as \"taking the easy way out\"
(226). [Viewing America\'s treatment of black men as inevitably lethal,
Gunnar retorts, **\"Might as well kill myself, right? Why give you the
satisfaction\"**]{.underline} (226). To take away the nation\'s capacity
to issue death is thus to reclaim the autonomy of the subject by
rendering morbidity a possession that can be reclaimed. It is this very
instrumental notion of death that might lead readers to interpret the
novel as one that holds a lingering nostalgia for the wholeness of civil
rights activism or black nationalism. [The text elaborates]{.underline}
this interpretive prospect when [blacks across the nation become utterly
**seduced by the idea of national suicide**]{.underline}. Gunnar\'s
speech inspires a black nationalist named Dexter Waverly to abandon his
superficial rhetoric and kill himself in protest against Boston
University\'s financial support of a corrupt African leader. The fact
that this suicide actually forces the university to rescind its
financial commitment to the African nation seems to confirm the
instrumental use of death and makes Gunnar a national celebrity. Reports
\"of black people killing themselves indiscriminately across the United
States\" soon emerge in the national media (201). Additionally, at
Gunnar\'s request, masses of people begin forwarding him their suicide
poems. In a world in which all blackness has been thoroughly commodified
[Gunnar recommends a]{.underline} poetics and [politics that [seeks to
reassert black]{.mark} national [agency by **rewriting death
as**]{.mark} **a [possibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Or [to frame this
challenge to commodification somewhat differently, black suicide offers
an intriguing **twist on Baudrillard\'s vision**]{.underline} of agency
within capital. [In his formulation, late capital achieves its hegemony
through a symbolic substitution of labor for death]{.underline}. The
\"equivalence of wages and labour power presupposes the death of the
worker,\" for a \"man must die to become labour power. He converts this
death into a wage\" (Symbolic 39). In this sense, then, the wage labor
system is always a curious commutation of an execution that capital
itself has already performed. Capital\'s \"gift\" is the sleight of hand
whereby it induces the worker\'s symbolic death by making him a wage
earner and then allows that worker the \"gift\" of buying his own
resurrection through labor. This is the unilateral nature of the gift
that sustains capital\'s dominance. But if \"domination comes from the
system\'s retention of the exclusivity of the gift without countergift .
. . then [[**the only solution** is]{.mark} to turn the principle of its
power back **against the system itself**]{.underline}: the impossibility
of responding or retorting. [To defy the system with a gift to which
**it cannot respond save by its own collapse and death**]{.underline}\"
(Symbolic 36-37; original italics). Following a parallel logic,
[national suicide]{.underline} in Beatty\'s novel [draws its power from
its simulation of capital\'s own unilateral gift, **the production of
black [death as that which refuses exchange]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Despite the allure]{.mark} of death\'s possibility, the
novel]{.underline} ultimately [**negates this gambit**.
Gunnar]{.underline} consistently [refuses his role as the messianic
leader]{.underline} of the masses. His rise to eminence brings increased
surveillance by the police and almost constant media scrutiny. After
returning to Hillside, the scopophilia becomes so acute that Gunnar and
his pregnant wife leave their apartment to take up residence at the La
Ciénega Motor Lodge and Laundromat. In his exile, he hopes that he can
find a more authentic mode of expression. He subsequently founds the
Bacchanalian MiseryFest, an open-mike poetry session that takes place
under the \"simple but effective\" stage lighting provided by orbiting
LAPD helicopters (219). While the events do allow for a communal
experience of artistic expression - \"neighborhood players read poetry,
held car shows, sang, danced\" - the political and aesthetic integrity
of the events seem compromised by their very spectacular nature (219).
[One night]{.underline}, in commemoration of Nick Scoby\'s suicide,
[Gunnar reads a poem and stages an act of [self-mutilation]{.mark} that
[underscores the **limits of death as a paradigm of symbolic
resistance**]{.mark}. The poem articulates the model of suicide as
resistance that asserts death as a unilateral gift.]{.underline} The
piece submits that [the most potent effects of slave rebellion lie not
in the effects of infanticide on the \"consciousness]{.underline} / of a
murderous parent\" [but \"in the slave owner\'s anguished cries / upon
discovering / his property permanently damaged.\" After the master
\"calculates his losses / fore casts the impact on this year\'s crop,\"
he \"will notice the textual eyes of murder]{.underline}/ suicide /
[read]{.underline} \'caveat emptor\' / let the [buyer
beware]{.underline}\" (222). In one sense, [this seems a perfect
allegory for death as that which refuses exchange; the poem thus reads
as a Baudrillardian offensive against capitalism. But Gunnar\'s
subsequent mutilation of himself]{.underline} - his cutting off of his
own finger - [complicates this politics considerably]{.underline}: \"I
reeled for a moment, then meticulously wrapped the speckled red
and-white handkerchief around the severed finger, exactly as I\'d seen
Robert Mitchum do in some American yakuza movie. Staring at the space
where my finger used to be, I held my hand high above my head\" (223).
His audience of \"distraught minions interpreted my masochistic act as
sincerity, the media as lunacy. The more I tried to deny my ascendency,
the more beloved I became\" (223). The spectacle of mutilation must be
seen as the enactment of the masochism that underwrites the poem\'s
strategy of resistance. Both depend on a vulgar display of black
self-mutilation. [Gunnar\'s cynical response]{.underline} also [confirms
the ultimate bankruptcy of these strategies.]{.underline} Prisoner of
both the police and the media at the moment in which he is most
resistant to the system, his rebellion is being recycled as part of the
dominant order\'s simulative strategies. [He cannot imagine a form of
agency without deriving it from a Hollywood film. In this respect, **the
[reclamation of death as]{.mark} a radical [subversion]{.mark} of
capital [is]{.mark} itself [vulnerable to the social order that]{.mark}
the strategy [seeks to challenge]{.mark}**. In short-circuiting the
Utopian potential of revolt, the novel foregrounds the absoluteness
of]{.underline} the system\'s [dominance]{.underline}, the
inescapability of its atomizing effects. The core contradiction of
Beatty\'s novel, then, does not reside in a vexed nostalgia for coherent
community, but in the fact that the text draws euphorically on the
abstractions of commodification while foregrounding its insinuation into
every sphere of contemporary African American life.

[By **refusing an equation** between death and political agency the
novel]{.underline} not only [works **contrary to
Baudrillard\'s**]{.underline} Marxism but also in contradistinction to a
seminal current in black cultural **[theory]{.underline}**. Influential
works by Sharon Holland and Paul Gilroy imagine that dwelling among and
even \"resurrecting\" the dead serves as both a means to confirm the
agency of the individual subject and the racial com munity. Holland\'s
reading of Morrison\'s Beloved construes the novel as a labor to
resurrect \"the \'ghost\' of slavery in order to let the dead speak to
the living, in order to allow silence to manifest itself in language\"
(40). By opening up the possibility of communion between the dead child
and the living black subjects in the novel, Beloved brings \"about the
repair of the psychic damage of slavery and serves as an antidote to the
beleaguered status of black women in contemporary America\" (52). The
dead thus make possible a series of reversals, from silence to speech,
from damaged to recovered, and from beleaguered to unburdened. Along the
same lines, Gilroy\'s account of transatlantic performances that
commemorate the dead also serve to consolidate at once the subjectivity
of the black performer and a racial community as such. As he phrases it,
the \"turn towards death\" also \"points to the ways in which black
cultural forms have hosted and even cultivated a dynamic rap port with
the presence of death and suffering\" (198). Gilroy interprets musical
forms like the blues and jazz as \"mnemonic\" devices that \"preserve
and cultivate . . . the distinctive rapport with the presence of death
which derives from slavery \...\" (198, 203). Cultural practices thereby
facilitate the reproduction of the death and negativity that attended
the African\'s bondage in New World slavery. It is in this remembrance
that Gilroy locates the grounds for a black \"racial counterculture\"
and thus political agency (200). By contrast, [in Beatty\'s work [death
provides **no Utopian opposition**]{.mark} **against late capitalism**.
Even as Beatty evokes the legacy of death in slavery, he insists that
[the fantasy]{.mark} of black agency [must]{.mark} also [be **subject to
the limits of** ]{.mark}**late capitalist
[hegemony]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The result of the strategy is that it
insists on the primacy of the problematic that attends contemporary
political economy. [This approach contains an implicit charge that
[insisting on the]{.mark} Utopian [possibility of the slave\'s death
is]{.mark}]{.underline} in some sense [[to **evade the quandaries of**
]{.mark}**contemporary [political economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[An ambivalence about the achievement of agency through death surfaces
in James\'s Negrophobia in very different terms. A passage featuring a
character named Talking Dreads develops a scenario]{.underline} that
parallels James\'s evocation of Voodoo. Whereas Maid fails to use Voodoo
effectively because she does not understand the power of simulation to
reproduce every act of resistance as part of itself, Talking Dreads
overcomes that liability. This being from another planet appears to
Bubbles Brazil at times as a \"disembodied, dreadlocked head\" and at
others as an \"empty white linen suit\" (123). He recounts the story of
how he was used by a Scottish female author as the inspiration for a
text with the title Ul\' Black Zambo. Of course, the title and authorial
biography point to Helen Bannerman\'s notoriously racist chil dren\'s
story Uttle Black Sambo. Therefore, when readers learn that UV Black
Zambo is a text based on its author\'s inability to see Talking Dreads
as anything but the racist caricatures in her imagination, the novel
implicates Bannerman\'s text in the same process of misrecognition.
Moreover, as the linguistic blend of \"zombie\" and \"Sambo\" in the
title suggests, the text of Uly Black Zambo can be read as a represen
tation in which James\'s investment in Voodoo and the commodity
converge. That is, the orthographic changes invoking Voodoo zombies also
underscore the text\'s play with the dead signifiers of racial
representation. [The text recodes the commodified blackness in
Bannerman\'s original text in order to produce a **simulation that takes
the original to task**.]{.underline} The strategy is evident in the
first lines of the simulated text.

> IiP Black Zambo was a little nigger boy. Or Pickaninny. Or jigaboo. Or
> any number of names we have for little colored children - shine,
> smoke, snowball, dinge, dust, inky, egg plant, and chocolate moonpie.
> And since IiT Black Zambo lived with his mammy in a one room hut made
> of mud and leaves near a croc-infested swamp in the Jungle, we can
> call him \'gator bait, too. (124-25)

The incongruity between the dulcet rhetoric of the children\'s tale and
the crude abjection of Zambo in this stockpiling of racial epithets
places the concealed vio lence of Bannerman\'s text at the forefront of
its simulation. And in this way occu pying the dead form of the
commodity allows Negrophobia to make the kind of instrumental counter to
racism that James imagines as \"subverting the perversion.\" Still,
despite James\'s claim regarding Voodoo, it is Bannerman\'s commodified
repre sentation that allows him to make such a maneuver. The invocation
of Voodoo mystifies a set of social relations that have more to do with
capital than Haitian reli gion as such. Moreover, the rebellion that
Talking Dreads engages in is more accu rately described as simulation
than Voodoo. This becomes all the more apparent when he shows Bubbles a
secret project to defeat white racism. It involves a simu lated town
called Garvey\'s Corner in which all of the citizens appear to be white
Americans but are in fact blacks \"trained to look, act and think
white\" (139). These [simulated whites are reproduced to \"undermine all
the rights and freedoms American society has to offer the white race
without the slightest detection\"]{.underline} (139). In a sense then,
**[the tactic here is to undermine white supremacy by becoming as adept
in simulation as the dominant culture]{.underline}**.

Ever consistent in its disintegrative aesthetic, however, the novel
upsets the utopia that Talking Dreads endorses. [In a parallel episode
the narrative focuses on the Zombie Master, a self-styled
\"revolutionary\" character. He aims to overthrow white supremacy by
building an army of zombies out of the bodies of **dead
celebrities**]{.underline}. JFK and Elvis are among the corpses that he
reconstructs in his laboratory. [The chief manifestation of the white
supremacy that the Zombie Master aims to destroy is]{.underline} Walt
**[Disney]{.underline}**. In a brilliant parody of white supremacist
ideology, Walt Disney uses all of his mass-culture resources to foment
the rage of white Americans and thereby destroy the black race. Giving a
speech modeled on the Gettysburg Address, he asks the white Nation to
embrace his enduring nativist creed: \"Hang the nigger and burn the
Jew!\" (99). [The Zombie Master counters this nationalist plot when he
sends hordes of his zombies in to destroy]{.underline} Walt
[Disney]{.underline} and his theme park, the Disney Magic Mall. As the
assault on the park unfolds, the Zombie Master and his favorite Zombie,
Elvis, discover Disney asleep in his sub basement casket. [Zombie Master
begins to drive \"the stake into Walt\'s heart\" when he realizes that
Disney is **literally a robot and therefore \"a puppet in his own mad
design!\"**]{.underline} (111). [The scene anatomizes a chief problem
with investing in the radical insurgency of the dead. [A]{.mark}
political [battle]{.mark} between simulations [could turn out to
be]{.mark} just that, an **[empty symbolic endeavor with no
consequential stakes]{.mark}**. The culture of [simulation may]{.mark}
have the effect of [render]{.mark}ing **even [symbolic gestures]{.mark}
of resistance [obsolete]{.mark}**; it is this **dystopian possibility**
that the radical visions of Talking Dreads and **Baudrillard fail to
address**.]{.underline}

[For both James and Beatty then, the tensions between the aesthetic
possibilities of simulated blackness and the fraught prospects of
political agency in a world inundated by simulation pose the problem of
black postmodernity in terms that **exceed the discourse of
crisis**]{.underline}. One cannot read these texts exclusively as
indexes of a crisis in belonging, for they begin with the premise that
whatever made older forms of communion possible now only exists as
spectral reproduction. And if there is no returning to the past, then
these are novels inordinately concerned with the cartography of the
present. [They probe the possibilities and limits of literature and
politics within late capitalism. While they traffic in the recombination
made available by simulated blackness, they are also shrewdly aware that
**[these]{.mark} same [mechanisms install new]{.mark} forms of [racial
domination]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The timely genius of the novels is
that **[they are neither seduced entirely by the prospect of a radically
recoding simulation]{.underline}** in the manner of poststructuralists
**[like Baudrillard]{.underline}** and Foster, nor held prisoner by
Blanchot\'s suggestion that death makes available only a set of dubious
performative operations. Employing the archive of dead signifiers that
produce racial difference as mediating terms between death\'s erasure
and possibility, these texts insist on our reconsideration of existing
frameworks for reading contemporary black culture. Indeed, the refusal
to invest in a politics of authenticity militates against the persistent
critical desire to find racial affirmation in black art. It is this
longing that shapes the ongoing controversies surrounding not only
Darius James but also die visual art of Michael Ray Charles and Kara
Walker.10 Critics take issue with this work because in their minds it
reproduces the denigrating minstrel representations of the past. What
such commentaries have not addressed is how [the art itself challenges
the very foundations of this critique by undermining the concept of a
Utopian black expressive culture that transcends or inverts
capital.]{.underline} As I have argued, a useful alternative to
indicting the work for its complicity in racist representation is to
interpret it as an aesthetic tendency that both grapples with the
difficulties posed by late capitalist political economy and formalizes
its own ideological implication in the contra dictions produced by that
system. [To wish that this art were like that of another time is to
**evade a present** not adequately examined and perhaps to refuse the
potentially unreal future of race]{.underline}.

legislator in Georgia, is widely **credited as the architect behind
grassroots efforts** to **turn "blue" a state that has not voted for a
Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 30 years.**]{.underline} Ben
Rhodes, a former top adviser to Barack Obama, spoke for many of Mr
Biden's supporters when he said: "[As Democrats chart a course forward
as a party]{.underline}, the first person [they should turn
to]{.underline} is [Stacey Abrams]{.underline}." In 2014, Ms [Abrams set
up a group called the New Georgia Project focused on registering and
mobilising black voters]{.underline}. [Two years ago, she
formed]{.underline} another organisation, [Fair Fight Action, to tackle
voter suppression after she lost the Georgia governor's race to
Republican Brian Kemp by less than a percentage point. Since then,
**some 800,000 new voters** have been registered in the state, many of
them African-American.]{.underline} As of Friday afternoon, ballots were
still being counted in Georgia. But it looked increasingly likely that
Mr Biden would emerge the victor there, after early and mail-in votes
from black communities in and around the city of Atlanta were tabulated,
allowing him to overtake Mr Trump in the vote count. Voter registration
figures, early voting data and county-level election results suggest
similar patterns helped Mr Biden edge out Mr Trump in other battleground
states, notably Pennsylvania and Michigan. [Had we not seen this level
of engagement and intensity and enthusiasm, among voters of
colour . . . we would be looking at a very **different
outcome**]{.underline} Tom Bonier, TargetSmart "We have a really strong
data set and pool of evidence that [the black vote was crucial,
especially as you look at the narrow margins in some of these key
states]{.underline}," said Tom Bonier, chief executive of TargetSmart, a
Democratic data company. He added that voter registration [figures in
Georgia and nationwide showed a surge of black people signing up to cast
ballots in the wake of the killing of George Floyd at the start of the
summer]{.underline}. "Had we not seen this level of engagement and
intensity and enthusiasm, among voters of colour . . . we would be
looking at a very different outcome," he said. Democratic activists have
for years recognised that African-Americans were key to their party's
prospects at the ballot box, especially after the 2016 election, when
black voter turnout nationwide fell for the first time in two decades.
Even though 91 per cent of black voters cast their ballots for Hillary
Clinton, compared with just 6 per cent who backed Mr Trump, analysts
said the fact black voters stayed at home in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and
Michigan --- which Mr Trump won by razor-thin margins of 44,000, 22,700
and 10,700 votes, respectively --- probably cost Mrs Clinton victory.
"One of the shortcomings of the 2016 election for Democrats was black
voter turnout lagged behind 2012, especially among younger black men,"
Mr Bonier said. "The evidence we have now in this election is those
numbers rebounded, and then some, to historic levels." LaTosha Brown,
right, co-founder of the Black Votes Matter Fund © Dean Anthony ll Ms
Abrams wrote on Twitter on Friday that her heart was "full", adding that
"so many deserve credit" for Georgia's surge towards the Democrats.
[Georgia voters have not backed a Democratic presidential candidate
since 1992]{.underline}. Before that, the last Democrat to be successful
in Georgia was Jimmy Carter, a native of the state, back in 1976. One of
the groups Ms [Abrams cited was the Black Voters Matter
Fund]{.underline}, an Atlanta-based grassroots organisation co-founded
by LaTosha Brown. Ms Brown, who has spent recent weeks on a multi-state
bus tour meeting black community leaders, said the election results were
the culmination of years of work in engaging underserved communities
that politicians had historically ignored. "[Community based organising
works. Investing on the ground can make the difference]{.underline},"
she said, explaining that her group's strategy was to support and fund
grassroots organisations rather than take a top-down approach. Ms Brown
led a multi-state bus tour to register black voters © Dean Anthony ll
"We know our community. It's going to take the churches, it's going to
take the civic groups, it's going to take the activists, it's going to
take the organisers, it's going to take the businesses," she added.
"We've shown that [when you invest in people on the ground, these are
the results that you get."]{.underline} Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic
strategist based in South Carolina and an adviser to Mr Clyburn, agreed.
"This is why so many of us, for so long, have been screaming that you
have to treat the black vote as an investment, not an expense," he said.
"[Black people knew that this election was about survival, and they
voted as such]{.underline}. "The truth of the matter is [when democracy
needed recalibration, it was the most consequential voting bloc in
American history]{.underline}."

## Passive voice

#### Passive voice is key -- it [boosts]{.underline} minority participation and expands dominant discourse into critical theory

[**Historically, the topics that have been selected have been
constructed utilizing the active voice as opposed to a passive voice**.
An active voice example would be, ―Resolved: The United States Federal
Government should substantially increase statutory and/or judicial
restrictions on the war powers authority of the President of the United
States. A passive voice example would be, ―Resolved: The war powers
authority of the President of the United States should be substantially
restricted**. The active voice topics require debaters to defend that
the United States Federal Government** ―do something in a more limited
capacity]{.underline}, [whereas a [passive voice]{.mark}]{.underline}
topic [could [allow debaters]{.mark}]{.underline} the opportunity [[to
defend]{.mark} a variety of interpretations of ―[something being done by
or to the]{.mark}]{.underline} United States Federal
[[Government]{.mark}. **The [active voice]{.mark} topic [always
gives]{.mark} the [agency]{.mark} to act [to the]{.mark} United States
[Government]{.mark}.**]{.underline} For students that see themselves as
having the possibility to access these positions of power, acquiring
these skills become empowering. However, [many [marginalized students
come to Debate from communities]{.mark} that have historically been
[excluded from]{.mark} these [positions of power]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Having [[a passive topic]{.mark} that removes]{.underline} the [agency
from the United States Federal Government]{.underline} and
[[allows]{.mark} debaters]{.underline} the [[flexibility to
choose]{.mark} who has [agency]{.mark}]{.underline} thus becomes [[more
empowering to this population]{.underline}]{.mark} of students. [These
[students would]{.mark} then [be more motivated to participate]{.mark}
in]{.underline} the process of [debate through which [they can
acquire]{.mark}]{.underline} a variety of [[skill sets from]{.mark}
politician to]{.underline} community [activists]{.underline}. Secondly,
[[the lit]{.underline}]{.mark}erature [[base]{.mark} used to construct
the topic]{.underline} has [[failed to include]{.mark} perspectives
found within the race literature,]{.underline} such as the legal and
political scholarship of Derrick Bell (1992), Cornel West (1994), and
bell hooks (1995). Very [little]{.underline}, if any, [attention has
been given to [Critical ]{.mark}]{.underline}Race Theory or [Critical
[Legal Studies within the chosen controversy areas]{.mark}, such as
Immigration]{.underline} and Supreme Court Cases. Even when topic papers
are submitted that do include this literature, they are rarely, if ever
selected in the voting process. This is important to the conversation of
debating the topic in that [[the topic]{.mark} paper [sets the
definition]{.mark}]{.underline}al guidelines [of what is]{.underline}
considered [topical. [If ]{.mark}]{.underline}the topic paper is
[[limited to the language]{.underline}]{.mark} and perspective [[of the
dominant, then so too will]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[debates]{.mark} be
limited to the language and perspective of the dominant.]{.underline}
Thus, it could be argued that [[the topic does not account
for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[discourse strategies]{.mark} of
marginalized populations and could be an additional source of exclusion
from Debate.]{.underline}

Our analysis begins by [[looking at]{.mark} how the Black/White
[achievement gap]{.mark} has featured [in the]{.mark} changing
[landscape of relevant]{.mark} academic and [policy
debates]{.mark}]{.underline} over the period. We then set out the
[methods and data sources that [provide]{.mark} the [material
for]{.mark} our [analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}. The paper concludes by
discussing the wider lessons that can be drawn, especially concerning
the role of education policy, the [[uncertainty of]{.mark} progressive
[antiracist gains]{.mark} and the speed with which they [can be rolled
back by]{.mark} apparently [technical changes]{.mark}]{.underline} in
how 'standards' are measured and debated. First, it is useful to be
explicit about the parameters for our analysis. Framework and focus:
What this paper is, and is not, about This paper charts the inequality
of achievement between Black and White students at the end of compulsory
schooling over a 25-year period (1988--2013). Our analytic framework is
[[informed by Critical Race Theory]{.underline}]{.mark} (CRT), an
approach that views race as a social construction [whose definition and
[deployment (in policy]{.mark} and practice[) **is highly**]{.mark}
complex, [contingent]{.mark} and fluid]{.underline} (Crenshaw et al.,
1995; Delgado, 1995; Ladson-Billings & Tate, 1995; Dixson & Rousseau,
2006; Taylor et al., 2016). Critical race theorists do not view racism
as merely encompassing crude and obvious acts of race hatred. Rather,
CRT also focuses on 'business-as-usual forms of racism' (Delgado &
Stefancic, 2000, p. xvi), i.e. the everyday, mundane and
taken-for-granted processes and assumptions that shape society in the
interests of people identified as 'White' and [against the interests of
particular minoritised groups]{.underline}.2

## AT: Surrender to Blackness

#### "Surrender to Blackness" is [worse]{.underline} for community formation, [reifies]{.underline} trauma, and actively [strengthens]{.underline} anti-Black structures by marginalizing the Black people who [were never here to surrender to in the first place]{.underline}.

**Táíwò, 20**---assistant professor of philosophy at Georgetown
University (Olúfémi, "Being-in-the-Room Privilege: Elite Capture and
Epistemic Deference," The Philosopher, vol. 108, no. 4, dml)

I think it's less about the core ideas and more about the prevailing
norms that convert them into practice. The call to "listen to the most
affected" or "centre the most marginalized" is ubiquitous in many
academic and activist circles. But it's never sat well with me. In my
experience, [[when people say]{.mark} they need to ["**listen to the
most affected**", it]{.mark} isn't because they intend to set up **Skype
calls to refugee camps** or to **collaborate with houseless
people**]{.underline}. Instead, [it has more [often meant]{.mark}
handing **[conversational authority]{.mark}** and **attentional goods**
to those who **most snugly fit** into the social categories associated
with these ills -- **regardless** of what they actually **do** or **do
not know**, or what they **have** or **have not personally
experienced**]{.underline}. In the case of my conversation with Helen,
my racial category tied me more "authentically" to an experience that
neither of us had had. She was called to defer to me by the rules of the
game as we understood it. Even where stakes are high -- where potential
researchers are discussing how to understand a social phenomenon, where
activists are deciding what to target -- these rules often prevail.

The trap wasn't that standpoint epistemology was affecting the
conversation, but how. Broadly, [the norms]{.underline} of putting
standpoint epistemology into practice [[call for]{.mark} practices of
**[deference]{.mark}**: **giving offerings**, **passing the mic**,
**believing**]{.underline}. These are good ideas in many cases, and the
norms that ask us to be ready to do them stem from admirable
motivations: a desire to increase the social power of marginalized
people identified as sources of knowledge and rightful targets of
deferential behaviour. But [deferring in this way [as a]{.mark} **rule**
or [**default political orientation**]{.mark} can actually work
**[counter]{.mark}** to [marginalized groups' interests,]{.mark}
especially [in **elite spaces**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Some rooms have **outsize**]{.mark} **power** and
**[influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}: the Situation Room, the newsroom,
the bargaining table, the conference room. [[Being in these rooms means
being in a position to **affect institutions**]{.mark} and **broader
social dynamics** by way of deciding what one is to say and do.
[Access]{.mark} to these rooms [is itself a]{.mark} kind of **[social
advantage]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and one often gained through some
prior social advantage. From a societal standpoint, [the "**most
affected**" by]{.underline} the [social injustices]{.underline} we
associate with politically important identities like gender, class,
race, and nationality [are **disproportionately likely** to
be]{.underline} incarcerated, underemployed, or part of the 44 percent
of the world's population without internet access -- and thus [both
**left out** of the rooms of power and **largely ignored** by the people
in the rooms of power]{.underline}. [[Individuals]{.mark} who make it
past]{.underline} the various **[social selection
pressures]{.underline}** that filter out those social identities
associated with these negative outcomes are most likely to be in the
room. That is, [they [are most likely to be in the]{.mark} [room]{.mark}
precisely [because of ways]{.mark} in which [they are]{.mark}
[**systematically different** from]{.mark} (and thus potentially
**unrepresentative** of) [the]{.mark} very [people they]{.mark} are then
**asked to [represent]{.mark}** in the room]{.underline}.

I suspected that Helen's offer was a trap. She was not the one who set
it, but it threatened to ensnare us both all the same. Broader cultural
norms -- the sort set in motion by prefacing statements with "As a Black
man..." -- cued up a set of standpoint-respecting practices that many of
us know consciously or unconsciously by rote. However, [the forms of
[deference]{.mark}]{.underline} that often follow [are ultimately
**self-undermining** and only reliably [serve "**elite
capture**]{.mark}": the control over **political agendas** and
**resources** by a group's **most advantaged** people. If we want
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} use standpoint epistemology to
[**[challenge]{.mark}** [unjust]{.mark} power [arrangements, it's **hard
to imagine** how we could do **worse**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

To say what's wrong with the popular, deferential applications of
standpoint epistemology, we need to understand what makes it popular. A
number of cynical answers present themselves: some (especially the more
socially advantaged) don't genuinely want social change -- they just
want the appearance of it. Alternatively, deference to figures from
oppressed communities is a performance that sanitizes, apologizes for,
or simply distracts from the fact that the deferrer has enough "in the
room" privilege for their "lifting up" of a perspective to be of
consequence.

I suspect there is some truth to these views, but I am unsatisfied. Many
of the people who support and enact these deferential norms are rather
like Helen: motivated by the right reasons, but trusting people they
share such rooms with to help them find the proper practical expression
of their joint moral commitments. We don't need to attribute bad faith
to all or even most of those who interpret standpoint epistemology
deferentially to explain the phenomenon, and it's not even clear it
would help. Bad "roommates" aren't the problem for the same reason that
Helen being a good roommate wasn't the solution: the problem emerges
from how the rooms themselves are constructed and managed.

To return to the initial example with Helen, the issue wasn't merely
that I hadn't grown up in the kind of low-income, redlined community she
was imagining. The epistemic situation was much worse than this. Many of
the facts about me that made my life chances different from those of the
people she was imagining were the very same facts that made me likely to
be offered things on their behalf. If I had grown up in such a
community, we probably wouldn't have been on the phone together.

Many aspects of our social system serve as filtering mechanisms,
determining which interactions happen and between whom, and thus which
social patterns people are in a position to observe. For the majority of
the 20th century, the U.S. quota system of immigration made legal
immigration with a path to citizenship almost exclusively available to
Europeans (earning Hitler's regard as the obvious "leader in developing
explicitly racist policies of nationality and immigration"). But the
1965 Immigration and Nationality Act opened up immigration
possibilities, with a preference for "skilled labour".

My parents' qualification as skilled labourers does much to explain
their entry into the country and the subsequent class advantages and
monetary resources (such as wealth) that I was born into. We are not
atypical: the Nigerian-American population is one of the country's most
successful immigrant populations (what no one mentions, of course, is
that the 112,000 or so Nigerian-Americans with advanced degrees is
utterly dwarfed by the 82 million Nigerians who live on less than a
dollar a day, or how the former fact intersects with the latter). The
selectivity of immigration law helps explain the rates of educational
attainment of the Nigerian diasporic community that raised me, which in
turn helps explain my entry into the exclusive Advanced Placement and
Honours classes in high school, which in turn helps explain my access to
higher education\...and so on, and so on.

It is easy, then, to see how [this deferential form]{.underline} of
standpoint epistemology [contributes to elite capture at **scale**. The
rooms of power and influence are at the end of causal chains that have
**selection effects**. [As you get]{.mark} higher and [higher]{.mark}
forms of [education]{.mark}, [social experiences **narrow**]{.mark} --
[some students are pipelined to **PhDs** and others to
**prisons**]{.mark}. Deferential ways of dealing with identity can
**inherit** the distortions caused by these selection
processes]{.underline}.

​[But it's equally easy to see locally]{.underline} -- in this room, in
this academic literature or field, in this conversation -- why [this
deference]{.underline} seems to make sense. It is often an improvement
on the epistemic procedure that preceded it: the person deferred to may
well be better epistemically positioned than the others in the room. It
[may well be the **best we can do** while holding **fixed** most of the
facts about the rooms themselves: what power resides in them, who is
admitted]{.underline}.

[But these are the **last** facts we should want to hold
fixed]{.underline}. Doing better than the epistemic norms we've
inherited from a history of explicit global apartheid is an awfully low
bar to set. [The facts that explain [who ends up in which room]{.mark}
[shape our world]{.mark} **much [more powerfully]{.mark}** [than]{.mark}
the squabbles for **[comparative prestige]{.mark}** between people who
have already made it into the rooms. And when the conversation is about
social justice, the mechanisms of the social system that determine who
gets into which room often just are the parts of society we aim to
address]{.underline}. For example, the fact that incarcerated people
cannot participate in academic discussions about freedom that physically
take place on campus is intimately related to the fact that they are
locked in cages.

[[Deference epistemology]{.mark} marks itself as a **solution** to an
epistemic and political problem. But not only does it [**fail** to solve
these problems,]{.mark} it **adds new ones**]{.underline}. One might
think [questions of justice ought to be primarily concerned with fixing
disparities around **health care**, **working conditions**, and **basic
material** and **interpersonal security**. Yet
conversations]{.underline} about justice [have come to be shaped by
people who have **ever more specific practical advice** about fixing the
**distribution of attention** and **conversational power**.
[Deference]{.mark} practices that serve **attention-focused
[campaigns]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. we've read too many white men,
let's now read some people of colour) [can **fail** on their own
**highly questionable** terms: attention to **spokespeople** from
marginalized groups could]{.underline}, for example, [**[direct
attention]{.mark} [away]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} the need to change
[the]{.mark} **social [system]{.mark}** []{.mark}that marginalizes
them.]{.underline}

[Elites from marginalized groups can **benefit** from this arrangement
in ways that are **compatible** with social progress. But treating group
elites' interests as **necessarily** or even **presumptively aligned**
with full group interests involves a **political naiveté** we cannot
afford. [Such treatment of elite interests functions as a **racial
Reaganomics**]{.mark}: a strategy [reliant on **fantasies**]{.mark}
[about]{.mark} the [exchange]{.mark} rate [between]{.mark} the
[attention]{.mark} economy [and]{.mark} the [material
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Perhaps the lucky few]{.mark} who get jobs finding the **most
culturally authentic** and **cosmetically radical description** of the
continuing carnage [are]{.mark} really **[winning one for the
culture]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Then[, after we]{.mark} in the
chattering class get the **clout we deserve** and [**secure the bag**,
it]{.mark}s contents [will eventually **trickle down** to]{.mark} the
[workers who **clean up after our conferences**]{.mark}, to **slums of
the Global South's megacities**, to its **countryside**.]{.underline}

**[[But probably not]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

A fuller and fairer assessment of what is going on with deference and
standpoint epistemology would go beyond technical argument, and contend
with the emotional appeals of this strategy of deference. Those in
powerful rooms may be "elites" relative to the larger group they
represent, but this guarantees nothing about how they are treated in the
rooms they are in. After all, a person privileged in an absolute sense
(a person belonging to, say, the half of the world that has secure
access to "basic needs") may nevertheless feel themselves to be
consistently on the low end of the power dynamics they actually
experience. [Deference epistemology]{.underline} responds to real,
morally weighty experiences of being put down, ignored, sidelined, or
silenced. It thus [has an important non-epistemic appeal to members
of]{.underline} stigmatized [or marginalized groups: it **intervenes
directly** in morally consequential practices of giving attention and
respect]{.underline}.

The social dynamics we experience have an outsize role in developing and
refining our political subjectivity, and our sense of ourselves. But
[this]{.underline} very [strength]{.underline} of standpoint
epistemology -- [its recognition of the importance of perspective --
becomes its **weakness** when combined with **deferential practical
norms**. Emphasis on the ways we are marginalized often matches the
world as we have experienced it. But, from a structural perspective, the
rooms we **never needed to enter** (and the explanations of why we can
**avoid** these rooms) might have **more to teach us** about the world
and our place in it. If so, [the deferential approach]{.mark} to
standpoint epistemology actually [**prevents** "**centring**]{.mark}" or
even **hearing** from [the most marginalized; it]{.mark}
[**focuses**]{.mark} us [on the]{.mark} interaction of the [rooms we
**occupy**]{.mark}, [rather than]{.mark} calling us to account for the
[interactions we **don't experience**]{.mark}]{.underline}

. This fact about who is in the room, combined with the fact that
speaking for others generates its own set of important problems
(particularly when they are not there to advocate for themselves),
eliminates pressures that might otherwise trouble the centrality of our
own suffering -- and of the suffering of the marginalized people that do
happen to make it into rooms with us.

[The dangers with this feature of deference politics are **grave**, as
are the risks for those outside of the most powerful rooms. For those
who are **deferred to**, it can supercharge **group-undermining
norms**]{.underline}. In Conflict is Not Abuse, Sarah Schulman makes a
provocative observation about the psychological effects of [both trauma
and felt superiority]{.underline}: [while these]{.underline} often [come
about for different reasons]{.underline} and have very different moral
statuses, [they result in similar behavioural patterns. Chief among
these are [**misrepresenting** the]{.mark} stakes of [conflict]{.mark}
(often by **overstating harm**) or representing others' independence as
a **hostile threat** ([such as failures to "**centre**" the **right
topics**]{.mark} or **people**). These behaviours, whatever their causal
history, [have **corrosive effects**]{.mark} on individuals who perform
them as well as the groups around them, **[especially when]{.mark} a
[community]{.mark}'s [norms magnify]{.mark}** or **multiply** [these
behaviours]{.mark} rather than **constraining** or **metabolizing**
them]{.underline}.

[For those who **defer**, the habit can supercharge **moral cowardice**.
The norms [provide]{.mark} social [cover for the **abdication of
responsibility**]{.mark}: it displaces onto **individual
heroes**]{.underline}, a hero class, or a mythicized past [the work that
is **ours** to do **now** in the present. Their perspective may be
clearer on **this** or **that specific matter**, but their **overall**
point of view isn't **any less particular** or **constrained** by
history than ours]{.underline}. More importantly, [deference places the
accountability that is **all of ours** to bear onto **select people** --
[and]{.mark}, more often than not, [a **hyper-sanitized**]{.mark} and
**thoroughly fictional [caricature]{.mark}** of them]{.underline}.

The same [tactics of deference]{.underline} that insulate us from
criticism also [**insulate** us from **connection** and
**transformation**. They **prevent** us from engaging **empathetically**
and **authentically** with the struggles of other people]{.underline} --
prerequisites of coalitional politics. [As identities become **more**
and **more fine-grained** and **disagreements sharper**, we come to
realize that "**coalitional politics**"]{.underline} (understood as
**[struggle across difference]{.underline}**) [is, simply, **politics**.
Thus, the deferential orientation, like that **fragmentation** of
political collectivity it enables, is ultimately
**anti-political**]{.underline}.

[[Deference]{.mark} rather than interdependence [may **soothe short-term
psychological wounds**]{.mark}. [But]{.mark} it does so [at a **steep
cost**]{.mark}: [it can **undermine**]{.mark} the [epistemic goals that
**motivate**]{.mark} the project, and it entrenches a politics
**unbefitting** of anyone [fighting for **freedom**]{.mark} [rather
than]{.mark} for **[privilege]{.mark}**, for **collective liberation**
rather than mere **parochial advantage**]{.underline}.

How would a constructive approach to putting standpoint epistemology
into practice differ from a deferential approach? [A constructive
approach would focus on the pursuit of **specific goals** or **end
results** rather than avoiding "**complicity**" in injustice or adhering
to **moral principles**. It would be concerned **primarily with building
institutions** and cultivating practices of **information-gathering**
rather than **helping**]{.underline}. It would focus on accountability
rather than conformity. [It would calibrate itself **directly** to the
task of **redistributing social resources** and **power** rather than to
**intermediary goals** cashed out in terms of **pedestals** or
**symbolism**]{.underline}. It would focus on building and rebuilding
rooms, not regulating traffic within and between them -- it would be a
world-making project: aimed at building and rebuilding actual structures
of social connection and movement, rather than mere critique of the ones
we already have.

The water crisis in Flint, Michigan presents a clear example of both the
possibilities and limitations of refining our epistemic politics in this
way. Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), a government
body tasked with the support of "healthy communities", with a team of
fifty trained scientists at its disposal, was complicit in covering up
the scale and gravity of the public health crisis from the beginning of
the crisis in 2014 until it garnered national attention in 2015.

The MDEQ, speaking from a position of epistemic and political authority,
defended the status quo in Flint. They claimed that "Flint water is safe
to drink", and were cited in Flint Mayor Dayne Walling's statement
aiming to "dispel myths and promote the truth about the Flint River"
during the April 2014 transition to the Flint River water source. That
transition was spearheaded under the tenure of the city's emergency
manager Darnell Earley (an African-American, like many of the city
residents he helped to poison). After the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) circulated a leaked internal memo from the federal Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) in July of 2014 expressing concern about lead in
Flint water, the MDEQ produced a doctored report that put the overall
measure of lead levels within federally mandated levels by mysteriously
failing to count two contaminated samples.

The reaction from residents was immediate. The month after the switch in
water source, residents reported that their tap water was discoloured
and gave off an alarming odour. They didn't need their oppression to be
"celebrated", "centred", or narrated in the newest academic parlance.
They didn't need someone to understand what it felt like to be poisoned.
What they needed was the lead out of their water. So they got to work.

The first step was to develop epistemic authority. To achieve this they
built a new room: one that put Flint residents and activists in active
collaboration with scientists who had the laboratories that could run
the relevant tests and prove the MDEQ's report to be fraudulent. Flint
residents' outcry recruited scientists to their cause and led a "citizen
science" campaign, further raising the alarm about the water quality and
distributing sample kits to neighbours to submit for testing. In this
stage, the alliance of residents and scientists won, and the poisoning
of the children of Flint emerged as a national scandal.

But this was not enough. The second step -- cleaning the water --
required more than state acknowledgement: it required apportioning
labour and resources to fix the water and address the continuing health
concerns. What Flint residents received, initially, was a mix of
platitudes and mockery from the ruling elite (some of this personally
committed by a President that shared a racial identity with many of
them). This year, however, it looks as though the tireless activism of
Flint residents and their expanding list of teammates has won additional
and more meaningful victories: the ongoing campaign is pushing the
replacements of the problematic service lines to their final stage and
is forcing the state of Michigan to agree to a settlement of \$600
million for affected families.

This outcome is in no way a wholesale victory: not only will attorney
fees cut a substantial portion of payouts, but the settlement cannot
undo the damage that was caused to the residents. A constructive
epistemology cannot guarantee full victory over an oppressive system by
itself. No epistemic orientation can by itself undo the various power
asymmetries between the people and the imperial state system. But it can
help make the game a little more competitive -- and deference
epistemology isn't even playing.

[The **biggest threats** to social justice attention and informational
economies are **not the absence of yet more jargon** to describe, ever
more precisely or incisively, the]{.underline} epistemic, attentional,
or interpersonal [**afflictions** of the disempowered. The biggest
threats are the **erosion** of the **practical** and **material bases**
for popular power]{.underline} over knowledge production and
distribution, particularly that [which could **aid effective political
action** and **constrain** or **eliminate predation** by elites. The
**capture** and **corruption** of these bases by well-positioned
elites]{.underline}, especially tech corporations, [goes on **unabated**
and largely **unchallenged**]{.underline}, including: the corporate
monopolization of local news, the ongoing destruction and looting of the
journalistic profession, the interference of corporations and
governments in key democratic processes, and the domination of elite
interests in the production of knowledge by research universities and
the circulation of the output of these distorted processes by
established media organizations.

Confronting these threats requires leaving some rooms -- and building
new ones.

[[The constructive approach]{.underline}]{.mark} to standpoint
epistemology is demanding. It [[asks]{.mark} that [we]{.mark} **swim
upstream**: to [be]{.mark} **[accountable]{.mark}** and **responsive**
[to people who **aren't yet in the room**]{.mark}, to build the kinds of
rooms we could **sit in together**]{.underline}, rather than merely
judiciously navigating the rooms history has built for us. But this
weighty demand is par for the course when it comes to the politics of
knowledge: the American philosopher Sandra Harding famously pointed out
that standpoint epistemology, properly understood, demands more rigour
from science and knowledge production processes generally, not less.

But one important topic stands unaddressed. [[The deferential
approach]{.underline}]{.mark} to standpoint epistemology [[often comes
packaged]{.mark} [with]{.mark} concern and attention to the importance
of **lived experience**]{.underline}. Among these, [**[traumatic
experiences]{.mark}** are especially foregrounded]{.underline}.

At this juncture, scholarly analysis and argument fail me. The remainder
of what I have to say skews more towards conviction than contention. But
the life of books has taught me that conviction has just as much to
teach, however differently posed or processed, and so I press on.

[[I take]{.mark} concerns about trauma **especially
[seriously]{.mark}**. I grew up in the United States, a nation
structured by [**settler colonialism**, **racial slavery**, and their
aftermath]{.mark}]{.underline}, with enough collective and historical
trauma to go round. [I also grew up in a Nigerian diasporic community,
populated by many who had **genocide in living memory**]{.underline}. At
the national and community level, I have seen a lot of traits of norms,
personality, quirks of habit and action that I've suspected were
downstream of these facts. At the level of individual experience, [I've
watched and felt myself change in reaction to fearing for my dignity or
life, to crushing pain and humiliation. [I reflect on]{.mark} these
[traumatic moments]{.mark} **often**, [and **very seldom think**:
"**That was educational**]{.mark}".]{.underline}

These experiences can be, if we are very fortunate, building blocks.
What comes of them depends on how the blocks are put together: what
standpoint epistemologists call the "achievement thesis". Briana Toole
clarifies that, by itself, one's social location only puts a person in a
position to know. "Epistemic privilege" or advantage is achieved only
through deliberate, concerted struggle from that position.

I concede outright that this is certainly one possible result of the
experience of oppression: have no doubt that humiliation, deprivation,
and suffering can build (especially in the context of the deliberate,
structured effort of "consciousness raising", as Toole specifically
highlights). But these same experiences can also destroy, and if I had
to bet on which effect would win most often, it would be the latter. As
Agnes Callard rightly notes, trauma (and even the righteous,
well-deserved anger that often accompanies it) can corrupt as readily as
it can ennoble. Perhaps more so.

Contra the old expression, pain -- whether borne of oppression or not --
is a poor teacher. Suffering is partial, short-sighted, and
self-absorbed. We shouldn't have a politics that expects different:
oppression is not a prep school.

When it comes down to it, the thing I believe most deeply about
[[deference epistemology]{.underline}]{.mark} is that it [asks something
of trauma that it **cannot give**]{.underline}. Demanding as the
constructive approach may be, [the deferential approach]{.underline} is
far more demanding and in a far more unfair way: it [asks the
traumatized to shoulder burdens **alone** that we ought to share
**collectively**]{.underline}. When I think about my trauma, I don't
think about grand lessons. I think about the quiet nobility of survival.
The very fact that those chapters weren't the final ones of my story is
powerful enough writing all on its own. It is enough to ask of those
experiences that I am still here to remember them.

[Deference epistemology asks us to be **less** than we are -- and not
even for our **own** benefit]{.underline}. As Nick Estes explains in the
context of Indigenous politics: "[The **cunning** of trauma politics is
that it turns **actual people** and **struggles**]{.underline}, whether
racial or Indigenous citizenship and belonging, [into matters of
**injury**. It **[defines an entire people]{.mark}** mostly [on their
**trauma**]{.mark} and not by their **aspirations** or **sheer
humanity**]{.underline}". [This performance is]{.underline} not for the
benefit of Indigenous people, but "[[for **white audiences**]{.mark} or
**institutions of power**]{.underline}".

I also think about James Baldwin's realization that the things that
tormented him the most were "the very things that connected me with all
the people who were alive, who had ever been alive". [That I have
**survived abuse** of various kinds, have faced **near-death** from both
accidental circumstance and violence]{.underline} (different as the
particulars of these may be from those around me) [is **[not a card to
play]{.mark} in gamified social interaction** or a **weapon to wield in
[battles over prestige]{.mark}**. It is **not** what gives me a
**special right to speak**, to **evaluate**, or to **decide for a
group**. It is a concrete, experiential manifestation of the
**vulnerability** that connects me to most of the people on this Earth.
It comes between me and other people not as a **wall**, but as a
**bridge**]{.underline}.

## Too monolithic

#### There is no monolithic "Blackness" to "center."

**Kennedy, 2-4**-21---Michael R. Klein Professor at Harvard Law School
(Randall, "On the Authority of Experience in Black Thought,"

[A **distinguished roster** of [black]{.mark} activist [thinkers
have]{.mark} adopted an **optimistic** perspective
regarding]{.underline} the possibility of attaining [racial
justice]{.underline} in America. Optimists include Mary McLeod Bethune,
Walter White, A. Philip Randolph, Martin Luther King Jr, Ralph Ellison,
John Lewis, and Barack Obama. [An **impressive cadre**]{.underline} of
black activist thinkers [believe]{.underline}, by contrast, that
attaining [racial justice]{.underline} in America [is a virtual
**impossibility**]{.underline}. Agreeing with Thomas Jefferson and
Alexis de Tocqueville, they contend that racial slavery fatally poisoned
the possibility of racial harmony in America. They contend that we shall
not overcome. Pessimists include Henry McNeal Turner, Elijah Muhammad,
Malcolm X, Derrick Bell, and Randall Robinson.

[Fervent [debates about]{.mark}]{.underline} scores of subjects --
indeed **[[every]{.mark} imaginable [subject]{.mark}]{.underline}** ---
[have roiled African Americans ideologically: [**accommodation** versus
**protest**]{.mark}]{.underline}; interracial socialism versus black
nationalism; Gandhian [[**non-violence** versus]{.mark} "**by [any
means]{.mark} necessary**,"]{.underline} support for affirmative action
versus detestation of "lowered standards," "integration" versus "black
power," ["**[respectability]{.mark}** politics"
[versus]{.mark}]{.underline} "I don't give a fuck"
[**[authenticity]{.mark}** politics]{.underline}. Black thinkers have
even disagreed over the years about the preferred term by which they
designate "Blacks," "blacks," "African Americans," "Negroes," "colored
people," and "people of color."

[There are several [impli]{.mark}cations to be drawn from recognizing
the **frequently underestimated**]{.underline} breadth, complexity, and
[variety of beliefs and perspectives]{.underline} found amongst African
Americans. [One [is the **dubious utility** of resorting to
"**experience**]{.mark}" as an explanation for a given way of
thinking]{.underline}. [It is frequently said]{.underline}, for example,
[that]{.underline} the **[egalitarianism]{.underline}** manifested in
the jurisprudence of Justice Thurgood Marshall [is a function
of]{.underline} his [**experience** as a **black man** oppressed by
white supremacism]{.underline}. But [what about **other black men** also
oppressed by white supremacism who responded **very
differently**]{.underline}, such as Justice Clarence Thomas, who is
deeply antagonistic towards the social egalitarianism that Marshall
embraced?

[A **wide variety** of thought is discernible amongst people who have
undergone a similar experience because experience **does not dictate
thought**]{.underline}. It is undoubtedly influential which is why one
can detect notable demographic patterns from which one can chart
probabilities. It is probable that an African American will prefer the
Democratic as opposed to the Republican candidate for president. But
that does not mean that the experience of a particular African American
will necessarily determine that person's preferences. [[Experience
affects thinking]{.mark} in **all sorts** of subtle, complex,
mysterious, and surprising ways. [But it **does not determine**]{.mark}
**thought**]{.underline}. Hence, [[we ought to be **skeptical**
about]{.mark} claims regarding "[the **authority of
experience**]{.mark}" and efforts to make a **credential** of
experience]{.underline}. [[That a person has
**suffered**]{.underline}]{.mark} impoverishment and
[[**marginalization** is]{.underline}]{.mark}, alas, **[[no
guarantee]{.underline}]{.mark}** at all [[that that person will be
**attuned** to]{.mark} those [social vices or **immune**]{.mark} to
them]{.underline}.
