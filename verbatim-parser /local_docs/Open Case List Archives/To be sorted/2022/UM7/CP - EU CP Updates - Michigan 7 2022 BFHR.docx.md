**[Misinformation]{.underline}** should be defined as the distribution
of verifiably false content without an intent to mislead or cause harm.
[Countermeasures should be developed from the perspective of **home
affairs** and the health of **public debate**]{.underline}, and they
should fall under the responsibility of the European Commission's
Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers (DG JUST); the
Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content, and Technology
(DG CNECT); the Directorate-General for Education and Culture (DG EAC);
the Directorate-General for Communication (DG COMM); and the Joint
Research Centre (JRC).

By contrast, **[disinformation]{.underline}** should be defined as the
creation, presentation, and dissemination of verifiably false content
for economic gain or to intentionally deceive the public, which may
cause public harm. [Countermeasures should cover **security

Amid the coronavirus pandemic, [Europe and the West are grappling
with]{.underline} a host of thorny dilemmas posed by [disinformation and
foreign influence operations]{.underline}. While these problems predate
the viral outbreak, the public health crisis has certainly exacerbated
them. Brussels has taken some steps to meet this set of challenges, some
of which are already paying dividends. But **[there is more that Europe
can do to make its response more effective]{.underline}**.
[**Specifically, the EU should** formulate shared terminology for
combating disinformation, assertively deter adversaries who are
spreading disinformation and conducting influence operations, craft
sensible nonregulatory interventions to protect online users, and
establish an independent, transparent auditing regimen for certain
online platform functions]{.underline}. Europe and the West are targets
of disinformation, influence operations, and foreign interference. And
the responses of most Western countries have been piecemeal and slow,
hampered by legal restraints and bureaucracy and lacking in real
political understanding of the problem and evidence of its impact.
Adversaries include states, organizations, and individuals. They have
developed well-established techniques and have laid the groundwork in
terms of building networks, disseminating narratives, and tapping into
local issues to gain unwitting grassroots supporters for current and
future campaigns. This puts the EU and its member states at a
disadvantage when it comes to countering these malicious activities. The
following factors give adversary actors a significant advantage. Some of
them pertain to the nature of the disinformation activities they pursue.
These adversary actors often employ low-cost, low-risk, and high-reward
tactics. They are first movers and use marginal technological
advantages, meaning that their activities can be fully under way before
they are noticed. Moreover, they are less restricted by legal, ethical,
and bureaucratic constraints, and the broad range of illegitimate
influence tools and techniques available to them make it difficult to
identify and counteract the full extent of their campaigns. [Adversaries
also benefit from the limitations and drawbacks of the EU's approach to
date]{.underline}. Targeted countries can often muster only limited
political will to acknowledge disinformation and particularly to
attribute, punish, and deter adversary actors. In addition, it is easier
to craft mitigation plans that focus on a single event, like an election
campaign, rather than ones that focus on ongoing public discourse.
Moreover, relevant government actors often have limited technical
capabilities to monitor, identify, analyze, attribute, and share
information about disinformation. Even digital platforms themselves are
limited in their capabilities to identify problematic cross-platform
behavior. To make matters worse, traditional media often leverage
aspects of these influence campaigns in their coverage, unwittingly
amplifying central disinformation narratives. Finally, the evidence of
harm caused by disinformation and influence operations is patchy, and
sufficient evidence for the effectiveness of countermeasures is lacking.
In Europe, experts view Russia as the dominant hostile actor currently
spreading disinformation. However, the political consensus to attribute
these activities to Russia, which was strong in the aftermath of the
annexation of Crimea and the 2016 U.S. presidential election, has
waned.1 Experts regard Russia as having achieved widespread penetration
of its narratives in multiple countries across Europe and elsewhere in
the world. There is a sense that its deployment of a wide range of
narratives implies that it is not sure what will or will not work, and
the low cost of such operations affords it a strategy of trial and
error. Russia's scattershot approach to disinformation entails running
multiple campaigns simultaneously, with some achieving notoriety while
the vast majority of them fail to attract attention from the target
audiences or gain traction. Experts express concerns about the extent to
which learning from previous successes and failures can increase the
efficacy, and therefore the impact, of future Russian disinformation
activities. Experts also raise concerns about influence operations run
by China. Many view China as Russia's superior in terms of its potential
capabilities and intent to spread disinformation and develop influence
campaigns, as well as to coordinate them with broader forms of soft
power. Not all its disinformation activities appear particularly
sophisticated at present, but experts express much interest in how it
might develop and test techniques at home before expanding their reach
abroad. However, Western countries have, to date, attributed few
influence operations to China. This is due to political concerns rather
than a lack of attributable activities. Traditionally known for its
cyber capabilities, Iran also poses an increasing disinformation
challenge. Smaller authoritarian and semi-authoritarian states like it
may increasingly see disinformation and interference, in conjunction
with other hybrid activities, as low-cost, high-reward opportunities to
achieve limited political goals in EU member states.2 They will likely
predominantly aim such activities at their own populations, including
through mainstream political parties and their supporters.
Disinformation seeded domestically can then be drawn upon as a source
for foreign interference. Experts also express increasing concerns that
EU member states themselves are becoming a source of misinformation and
disinformation. The three papers in this series establish a five-part
framework for analyzing influence operations known as the ABCDE
framework (actors, behavior, content, degree, effect): Actors: Experts
are concerned about Russia and China spreading disinformation, as well
as emboldened smaller countries with authoritarian or semi-authoritarian
governments. In addition, they are concerned about political parties and
governments within the EU becoming sources of disinformation. Behavior:
Experts are concerned about increasingly sophisticated efforts to evade
automated detection---for example, by mobilizing authentic
digital-platform accounts to engage in inauthentic behavior. Adversary
actors will likely boost a greater number of accounts with fewer
followers to avoid detection, thereby blurring the lines between
authentic and inauthentic and between coordinated and uncoordinated
behavior. Experts also anticipate a broader integration of hybrid
influence techniques and disinformation. Content: Experts expect grand
narratives, conspiracy theories, and rumors (like those currently
deployed in disinformation activities) to persist. These will be
opportunistic and continue to blur the lines between reasonable
expression and harmful content. Use of synthetic content such as
deep-text and deepfakes will likely become more common, although
technological solutions for identifying synthetic content will likely
develop in tandem. Degree: Adversary actors have an increased tendency
to produce content on self-hosted websites (including state
media--affiliated web platforms) that are then used to spread
disinformation on multiple digital platforms. Removal of this content by
individual platforms does not affect the source. Adversary actors may
use inorganic and semi-organic networks to flood hashtags and search
terms to make it harder to access trustworthy information. Paid services
for boosting digital platform profiles, in conjunction with existing
tools allowed by the platforms, will continue to enable platform
distortion. Experts also expect continued microtargeting of content, in
conjunction with wider manipulation of public discourse. Effect:
Adversary actors will likely continue their efforts to polarize and
discredit institutions and prominent individuals, including, in
particular, efforts to tarnish trust in nonpartisan actors. Existing
societal divisions and current affairs provide a sufficient basis for
polarization campaigns. By integrating disinformation with broader
hybrid influence campaigns, adversary actors will be able to threaten
public health or safety with greater frequency. The second paper in this
series discusses the utility and application of the ABCDE framework in
greater depth. The framework is useful because it provides a
standardized means of collecting, analyzing, and presenting information
about disinformation. CURRENT EU POLICY ON DISINFORMATION The EU has
taken some actions to counter disinformation and is grappling with how
to counter its adversaries in the information space. But its current
policy on disinformation is characterized by a lack of terminological
clarity, unclear and untested legal foundations, a weak evidence base,
an unreliable political mandate, and a variety of instruments that have
developed in an organic rather than a systematic manner. The limited
successes the EU has achieved so far---in terms of the creation of
instruments such as the Code of Practice on Disinformation, the Action
Plan Against Disinformation, the East StratCom Task Force, and the Rapid
Alert System---have been hard earned. One should not underestimate the
challenges posed by the different approaches of member states and EU
institutions to the disinformation problem; for example, many member
states do not recognize the problem, do not publicly attribute
particular malign activities to the offending adversaries, or are under
political pressure to limit support to EU-level activities to counter
disinformation. Within EU institutions, significant ownership and
coordination challenges abound. In this context, the creation of these
instruments should be considered a bureaucratic success. However,
adversary states can turn this inconsistent approach to their advantage,
potentially weakening the processes that are in place and undermining
the EU's countervailing system as a whole. FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
Disinformation is a term that defines a policy area but lacks a firm
legal basis, though some principles enshrined in human rights--related
legislation are relevant. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union (ECHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights (ICCPR) enshrine the rights to freedom of expression,
to privacy, and to political participation.3 The EU and its member
states have the positive obligation to enable an environment where
freedom of expression can be enjoyed. Many argue that disinformation and
public debate driven by artificial intelligence undermine this
fundamental right. Article 10 of the ECHR and Article 19 of the ICCPR
make provisions for freedom of expression that protect the right to
think and express oneself without interference as well as offer a degree
of protection to those who spread disinformation on the same grounds.4
Article 8 of the ECHR and Article 17 of the ICCPR protect the right to
privacy, which may be relevant in areas such as the use of personal data
to target groups and individuals with disinformation.5 Finally, Article
25 of the ICCPR and Article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights codify the right to participate in public affairs and elections,
which aspects of disinformation may diminish.6 In all these cases, these
fundamental rights are relatively unexplored in relation to
disinformation. Some scholarly work has explored whether state-backed
information operations may breach international law related to the
principle of nonintervention. Others have noted that influence
operations that threaten the use of force likely breach Article 2(4) of
the United Nations Charter, which explicitly prohibits the threat or use
of force.7 The more general principle of nonintervention, which
"provides a state with the right to be sovereign within its own
territory, free from external interference," requires that states do not
coerce one another in their relations.8 This principle applies most
obviously to political expression, particularly in the context of
elections. The targeting of critical infrastructure by influence
operations, including election systems if they are protected as such by
individual member states, should be considered intervention.9 However,
political campaigns---and public debate---are unlikely to be covered.
Some have argued that the principle of nonintervention also protects the
right to self-determination and freedom of thought and, therefore, the
right to "the conditions that enable the people to form authority and
will and to make free choices."10 An influence operation can thus be
coercive if it "substitutes the authentic process of self-determination
with an artificially constructed process in order to generate particular
attitudes and results aligned to the intervenor's will."11 The right to
freedom of thought offers a potential human rights focus on influence
operations that could be grounded in a better understanding of
manipulation techniques rather than content alone. Additional
applications of fundamental freedoms among EU member states specifically
include content-related restrictions on expression under private and
criminal law, such as defamation, insult, and incitement to hatred or
violence. Member states also regulate their respective election
frameworks, including rules on political campaigning, campaign finance,
political parties, and political advertising. Their relevant bodies of
national security legislation are also of relevance in relation to
foreign interference. THE EEAS STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION There
are two specific divisions within the European External Action Service
(EEAS) tasked with assuming various strategic communications
responsibilities relevant to disinformation.12 The Communications Policy
and Public Diplomacy side leads outreach to EU and external audiences on
EU foreign affairs, security and defense, and external action,
developing political communications on behalf of the high representative
for foreign affairs and security policy. It provides guidance, training,
and strategic support to EU delegations and missions/operations. The
division also manages communications campaigns, internal communication,
social media accounts, and digital platforms as well as public and
cultural diplomacy. It does not have a formal role related to
disinformation but rather fulfills advocacy and engagement functions for
political and cultural EU objectives, including support to all digital
media campaigns. The Task Forces and Information Analysis side focuses
on the Western Balkans and Europe's eastern and southern neighborhoods.
Its main role is to develop and implement proactive communications
activities and campaigns, including political advocacy and initiatives
in public and cultural diplomacy for these regions. It provides
analytical support for evidence-based communications and policies and
has a specific mandate to address disinformation and foreign
manipulative interference in the information space through the task
forces (see below).13 It is responsible for implementation of the EU's
Action Plan Against Disinformation and the Rapid Alert System (see
below) and for the development of future policy in this field. It also
has the mandate to support independent media and civil society in the
two neighborhoods and the Western Balkans. THE EAST STRATCOM TASK FORCE
The EU first addressed disinformation as a matter of priority for
security reasons. Following its annexation of Crimea in February 2014,
Russia demonstrated disinformation to be a key method of hybrid warfare.
In response to representations from a small group of concerned member
states, the European Council "stressed the need to challenge Russia's
ongoing disinformation campaigns" in March 2015.14 This push resulted in
the creation of the East StratCom Task Force within the EEAS's Strategic
Communications Division. The task force was established to effectively
communicate and promote EU policies toward the eastern neighborhood;
strengthen the overall media environment in the eastern neighborhood and
in member states, including by supporting media freedom and
strengthening independent media; and improve the EU's capacity to
forecast, address, and respond to disinformation activities by Russia.15
Many observers hoped that the East StratCom Task Force would find
evidence of how Russian state-sponsored disinformation infiltrated
Western media debates and support civil society to push back against
it.16 The task force produces a weekly review of pro-Kremlin
disinformation targeting the West as a flagship product on the
EUvsDisinfo web platform, and its database features over 8,000 examples
of disinformation.17 Its team has now grown to sixteen staff members
with extensive (but presently outsourced) capabilities in the areas of
media monitoring and strategic communications, following three years of
funding from the European Parliament. This funding source expires at the
end of 2020 and is not renewable. THE EU CODE OF PRACTICE ON
DISINFORMATION The EU has also sought to collaborate with private
companies to help stem the tide of hostile disinformation. In September
and October 2018, it launched a Code of Practice on Disinformation
together with roadmaps for implementation from partners in the private
sector. Running for a twelve-month trial period (which covered the
European Parliament elections in May 2019), the code was an experiment
in voluntary self-regulation by the tech industry. Signatories made
commitments in five areas: online advertisements, political advertising,
integrity of services, transparency for consumers, and transparency for
researchers.18 Private sector partners published reports detailing their
actions to mitigate disinformation. However, the signatories
self-reported their progress, and the information was not verified by an
external body. The lessons from this process will feed into further EU
policy developments in this area. A recent Carnegie paper details some
of the most important lessons from the code process.19 THE ACTION PLAN
AGAINST DISINFORMATION In December 2018, the European Commission
launched its Action Plan Against Disinformation, which remains a key
pillar of EU policy, granting mandates to several operational
instruments. This measure placed disinformation within the context of
hybrid threats and highlighted the role of strategic communications by
the EEAS "as a priority field for further work."20 The action plan
emphasized four areas of work: improving the capabilities of EU
institutions to detect, analyze, and expose disinformation;
strengthening coordinated and joint responses to disinformation;
mobilizing the private sector to tackle disinformation; and raising
awareness and improving societal resilience.21 It proposed maintaining
the mandate of the East StratCom Task Force and reviewing the mandates
of the Western Balkans and South Task Forces.22 The action plan
recommended an expansion of their resources and capabilities, as well as
the creation of a Rapid Alert System to strengthen coordination among EU
institutions, member states, and other relevant international networks.
It also proposed initiatives in the areas of strategic communications,
media literacy, and high-quality journalism. THE RAPID ALERT SYSTEM The
EEAS launched the Rapid Alert System in March 2019 to enable common
situational awareness related to disinformation spread across EU member
states, as well as the development of common responses.23 The system
consists of a rudimentary platform for information sharing, as well as a
network of points of contact in the various EU member states. The Rapid
Alert System is intended to connect to existing real-time monitoring
capabilities inside and outside of the EU, such as the Emergency
Response Coordination Centre and the EEAS Situation Room, as well as the
G7 Rapid Response Mechanism and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), though this goal has been only partially realized. The system is
therefore, in theory at least, an important platform for information
sharing from an international perspective. So far, relatively few highly
engaged EU member states share information through the Rapid Alert
System. Major differences in how member states view the threat of
disinformation are reflected in the use of the platform. In particular,
a lack of trust between member states has led to low levels of
information sharing and engagement. A successful aspect appears to be
the networks and relationships formed among small coalitions of
like-minded actors. Regular meetings have been held since early 2019,
but the system's alert function had not yet been triggered as of June
2020. ELECTION OBSERVATION MISSIONS EU-affiliated election observation
missions also have a role to play. In October 2019, the European Council
issued a document titled "Council Conclusions on Democracy," which
observed new challenges to democracy emerging around the world.24 These
include the undermining of democratic processes and institutions, low
levels of trust, shrinking democratic space for civil society, increased
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and manipulation
using online technologies. This last point includes issues of
disinformation, hate speech, privacy, and campaign funding. The European
Council made commitments to strengthening the EU's democracy-building
capabilities around the world, including promoting instruments created
to mitigate the effects of online interference during elections. As a
first step, election observation missions of the EU and its member
states have been developing a methodology to monitor online political
campaigns. In the case of EU missions, this methodology has been road
tested in elections in Peru, Sri Lanka, and Tunisia, and it will become
a standard part of all future missions. It will, in addition, create a
basis for EU support to strengthen research, monitoring, and oversight
capacities in third-country academic circles and civil society. THE
EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY ACTION PLAN AND DIGITAL SERVICES ACT In addition to
the aforementioned measures, the European Commission is also developing
two major new policies. First, it is preparing the 2020--2024 European
Democracy Action Plan,25 which includes specific commitments to project
EU values worldwide.26 This will likely include significant policy
commitments at the intersection of disinformation, electoral protection,
digital technologies, and public-private partnerships. In this regard,
it will set out next steps for building on the Code of Practice and the
Action Plan Against Disinformation. Second, building on existing
e-commerce rules, the EU is preparing a Digital Services Act.27 Among
other things, this measure will set out regulatory powers for the EU
over digital platforms, which are likely to include powers of regulation
and auditing relating to online disinformation. LESSONS FROM THE
CORONAVIRUS Disinformation has been an ongoing threat to the EU during
the coronavirus pandemic. The ability of EU institutions to handle this
challenge provides a valuable snapshot of the strengths and weaknesses
of their current policy instruments. This paper does not analyze the
overall EU response to the pandemic but instead concentrates on the
lessons relevant to the future of EU disinformation policy. It assumes
that the EU continues to grapple with disinformation threats with some
distinctive characteristics, as highlighted by multiple sources.28
Actors: Russia and China are running public-image campaigns in the West
linked to their overall handling of the crisis, campaigns that have
disinformation components. There also have been some limited activities
attributed to other state actors such as Iran. Meanwhile, many active
criminal groups---some of whom may be state-backed---are taking
advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to spread clickbait, phishing
scams, and blackmail. Amid the confusion, a wide range of politicians,
influencers, and individuals are distributing misinformation and/or
disinformation. Behavior: Russia's and China's messaging campaigns seek
to improve the reputations of their governments by comparing their
handling of the pandemic to how Western governments have been handling
it, in some cases by falsely representing the actions of the EU and its
member states. These campaigns involve coordinated efforts, parts of
which are transparently led by official sources such as state media and
parts of which are covert. They target multiple pressure points and use
tactics beyond disinformation, such as sowing multiple narratives,
making payments to online influencers, trolling dissenters, and making
diplomatic representations to EU institutions to repress attribution of
malign activities. Legitimate public relations activities related to the
provision of aid have been accompanied by disinformation campaigns about
the actions of the EU and its member states. Furthermore, state and
nonstate actors alike are employing hybrid and cyber techniques, in many
cases exploiting the public's coronavirus-related health concerns.
Content: There is a broad range of health-related coronavirus
disinformation, some of which can be linked to existing long-term,
pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives. A great deal of this content is
harmful and involves, for example, spreading false health information,
attacking the reputations of critical public health institutions, or
serving as a pretext for cyber intrusions designed to compromise
computer networks. There also have been many conspiracy theories
seemingly created to detract attention from the origins of the pandemic
and China's initial handling of it. Degree: There is insufficient
evidence to accurately assess the size and scope of the campaigns, but
it is clear that at least two major state-backed campaigns are ongoing.
They are conducted across platforms and in multiple languages, aimed at
a wide variety of domestic and international audiences. Some content is
being seeded on state media and other controlled websites prior to
distribution on digital platforms in order to facilitate cross-platform
distribution and mitigate the effects of removal from platforms. Aspects
of these campaigns could be considered within the remit of traditional
public diplomacy and soft power, while at times they draw upon
communications techniques associated with influence operations. Effects:
There are profound health and public safety risks associated with the
disinformation connected to these campaigns, as well as to the
activities of criminal and hacker groups. These campaigns aim to
undermine trust in institutions and to poison the climate of debate.
Some aspects of these campaigns demonstrate efforts to erode freedom of
thought and expression. Some of these activities also pose emerging
short-term and long-term risks to personal, organizational, and national
security. The EU institutions were committed to exposing the threat of
disinformation during the early phases of the pandemic. However, [a lack
of coherent policy]{.underline}---for example, in terms of supporting
member states such as Italy that were exposed to the virus early
on---[contributed to an environment in which disinformation could spread
more readily]{.underline}. Lacking in clear strategic communications of
their own policies at that point, the EU institutions focused on
exposing disinformation spread from Russia and misinformation spread by
individuals. The focus allowed the disinformation policy area to achieve
perhaps its highest-ever profile within the EU institutions, but at the
same time this outcome risked politicizing and placing undue pressure on
the instruments for countering disinformation. As of early June 2020,
the EUvsDisinfo web platform had identified around 570 cases of
coronavirus-related disinformation emanating from pro-Kremlin media.29
Simultaneously, in light of the increased political and public interest
in disinformation, the EEAS Strategic Communications and Information
Analysis Division produced special reports on coronavirus
disinformation, which were published on the EUvsDisinfo platform as EEAS
special reports. These summarize the research available from multiple
international sources and serve as snapshots of findings from the expert
community rather than independent research conducted by the EEAS.30
Subsequent leaks of these reports, and the decision to produce separate
public and internal versions, demonstrate the ad hoc nature of the
processes by which these documents were created. The details of the most
serious leaks, which relate to alleged Chinese pressure on the EU to
change the third report, are not discussed here.31 Some immediate
recommendations tailored to various relevant actors for the future of EU
disinformation policy are outlined below. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE
EUROPEAN COMMISSION Formulate tailored responses to state-sponsored
disinformation: Disinformation touches on many different policy areas.
When dealing with adversarial state actors, disinformation policy
responses should be tailored specifically to deter the particular
country or actor in question by altering their strategic calculus in a
coherent, coordinated (For more information, see the third paper in the
series, "Developing Policy Interventions for the 2020s.") Troubleshoot
issues that arose in the recent response to Chinese disinformation:
China is not a new disinformation actor, and the StratCom task forces
had already recruited a China specialist prior to the outbreak of the
pandemic. Furthermore, use of diplomatic representations to assert
pressure is a standard means of pushback used by actors accused of
disinformation by the EU and its member states, including Russia, and
this tactic is sometimes part of broader hybrid influence campaigns.
Commissioners should review the information-sharing structures that
exist between them and the EEAS to better understand why their stance
toward Chinese disinformation lacked preparedness in this instance.
Commissioners should review which other state-based disinformation
actors could provoke similar challenges in the future by, for example,
including their staffers on joint training, red-team drills, and
risk-assessment exercises. Take a long-term view and anticipate the
future trajectory of disinformation campaigns: The coronavirus pandemic
is likely to continue in some form or another for several months and
possibly years. Risk assessments for the next stages of the crisis
should focus on proactive intervention to address the vulnerabilities in
current societal debates. For example, the development and global
rollout of a vaccine is likely to be exploited by disinformation actors,
including state-backed actors. Offer appropriate backing to bodies
tasked with responding to disinformation: Attribution to state actors
always requires a clear political mandate---institutions such as the
EEAS need political protection if they are to attribute publicly, so as
not to be vulnerable to pushback from actors who are publicly shamed.
However, research and monitoring teams need to be able to report on what
they are seeing, accurately depict the views of the broader scientific
and intelligence communities, and speak truth to power. Commissioners
and the EEAS should agree on language around attribution in EEAS special
reports and on the EUvsDisinfo web platform. (A suggestion on how to do
this is outlined in the second paper in this series, "Crafting an EU
Disinformation Framework.") Develop new, more nuanced terminology for
disinformation: Part of the controversy surrounding attribution is a
product of current EU disinformation policy not being fit for purpose,
not least because the term "disinformation" is used as a catchall to
cover a range of influence activities. New terminology is required to
add nuance and precision to EU policy. (A suggestion to that end is
outlined in the second paper in this series, "Crafting an EU
Disinformation Framework.") Be transparent and supportive of actions
taken to combat disinformation: Public statements by the spokesperson
for European Commission Vice President for Values and Transparency Věra
Jourová, High Representative Josep Borrell, and European Commission
President Ursula von der Leyen have not served the staff or journalists
working on these reports well.32 Given the personal risks associated
with analyzing the disinformation of hostile foreign actors,
commissioners should demonstrate to staff that personal safety is
highest on their list of priorities. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE EEAS
STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION Clearly demarcate the origins of
EEAS-linked analytical reports: There should be a clear distinction
between work produced by the EEAS's task forces according to their
monitoring and analysis methodologies and its special reports that
summarize and assess the findings of the international research
community and governments. Special reports should be framed as
all-source research and open-source intelligence analysis. They should
follow a common and systematic framework, and each statement should be
linked to the source and, where possible, to a degree of confidence in
those findings. The overall assessment of the EEAS should be clearly
demarcated from the all-source summaries. (A proposal framework is
outlined in the second paper in the series, "Crafting an EU
Disinformation Framework.") Create a secure way for reports to be
revised: The issuance of internal and public reports has created
confusion, not least because both are unclassified. The EEAS needs a
secure process by which to gain political approval from the European
Commission for its assessments in the special reports when such a step
is appropriate. This process needs to ensure revisions can be made
without the risk of leaks, so that a single report can be amended
without the need to create separate versions. However, this political
process should only impact the EEAS's overall assessment of all
available evidence, not the all-source research and open-source
intelligence summaries. Fully utilize the Rapid Alert System: While the
Rapid Alert System was used to share reporting among EU member states,
an alert related to the pandemic has not yet been triggered.33 Given the
threat to public health that coronavirus disinformation represents, this
seems like a missed opportunity. The system remains an underused
resource that solves coordination and information-sharing problems
between the EU institutions and member states in theory, but it has not
performed a significant role in practice. The EU should further analyze
why the Rapid Alert System has not fulfilled its potential during this
crisis. Adopt a more strategic role: The Strategic Communications
Division has been proactive in becoming a hub for reporting on
coronavirus disinformation among the EU institutions. This role also
needs a strategic angle; for example, this could entail conducting risk
assessments for short- and medium-term disinformation threats and
sharing these with the institutions and member states. RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR THE EAST STRATCOM TASK FORCE Insulate EUvsDisinfo analysis from
day-to-day politics: The EUvsDisinfo platform should be kept separate
from other forms of EEAS analysis. It currently has a disclaimer stating
that it does not represent official EU policy, and it should retain this
arm's length distance to protect its work from day-to-day political
pressures. Double down on EUvsDisinfo's mission and methods: The
identity of the EUvsDisinfo platform should be strengthened with a
clearer statement of its goals, research methodologies, and political
mandate. It should be strengthened so it can represent its results as
products of rigorous monitoring and analysis methodologies, rather than
judgment calls that can be swayed by political considerations. A clear
statement of purpose and methodologies should also help the platform
avoid accusations of mission creep and bias, and such a statement would
allow the wider research community to better engage with its methods and
results. AN EU DISINFORMATION POLICY FOR THE 2020S [An approach for the
next stage of EU policy on disinformation]{.underline}---particularly
with respect to the European Democracy Action Plan--- is outlined below.
It [defines a way ahead and lays out the main options that should be
considered]{.underline} to meet future threats. It rests on four
pillars, which build on the principles described above and create a
coherent stance fit for the current and near-future threat landscape.
The [four pillars are:]{.underline} [A new approach to
terminology]{.underline}: developing EU-specific terminology and a
disinformation framework and delegating responsibility for different
terms and areas of work to specific EU institutions; [A new
assertiveness]{.underline}: formulating proactive methods for deterring
adversaries from spreading disinformation and conducting influence
operations and manipulative interference; [A new consultative
process]{.underline}: crafting nonregulatory interventions that enhance
the ability of digital platforms to protect users from disinformation;
and [A new regulatory regime]{.underline}: establishing independent
auditing of key elements of platform functions with a differentiated
approach to data transparency. The EU should first revise the
terminology used to support disinformation policy and analysis to make
it easier to distinguish between different aspects of the problem.
Disinformation is currently used as a catchall term that does not help
the EU institutions define different areas of problematic behavior. It
muddles the actions of individuals inadvertently sharing incorrect
information with the hybrid influence campaigns of hostile states. A
first step is therefore to create a rigorous framework designed to
define the scope of the challenge and assign responsibilities. The
second paper in this series proposes terminology and a framework capable
of systematizing the EU institutions' disinformation work, which is
briefly outlined below. TERMINOLOGY AND FRAMEWORK Four terms should
become authoritative definitions preferred by all EU institutions in
their engagements with stakeholders: misinformation, disinformation,
influence operations, and foreign interference. The benefit of
differentiating terms is to align democratic concerns---such as freedom
of expression, data transparency, and privacy---with the concerns of
national and European security, including around elections. To resolve
these tensions, the paper recommends using terminology that reflects
institutional ownership of various policy areas. Misinformation should
be defined as the distribution of verifiably false content without an
intent to mislead or cause harm. Countermeasures should be developed
from the perspective of home affairs and the health of public debate,
and they should fall under the responsibility of the European
Commission's Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers (DG JUST);
the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content, and
Technology (DG CNECT); the Directorate-General for Education and Culture
(DG EAC); the Directorate-General for Communication (DG COMM); and the
Joint Research Centre (JRC). By contrast, disinformation should be
defined as the creation, presentation, and dissemination of verifiably
false content for economic gain or to intentionally deceive the public,
which may cause public harm. Countermeasures should cover security
considerations, strategic communications for countering disinformation,
oversight of digital platforms, and research collaboration, and they
should fall under the responsibility of the above institutions as well
as the Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement
Negotiations (DG NEAR) and the EEAS. Meanwhile, influence operations
should be defined as coordinated efforts to influence a target audience
using a range of illegitimate and deceptive means, in support of the
objectives of an adversary. The development of countermeasures should be
the responsibility of the EEAS, in conjunction with other institutions
listed above, in line with its responsibilities for external relations,
foreign interference, threat monitoring and analysis, resilience
building in the EU's neighborhoods, and third-country election
monitoring. Finally, foreign interference should be defined as coercive,
deceptive, and/or nontransparent efforts by a foreign state actor or its
agents to disrupt the free formation and expression of political will,
during elections, for example. The development of countermeasures should
be the responsibility of the EEAS, in conjunction with the other
institutions listed above, and these countermeasures should emphasize
the distinct nature of responses targeting foreign state actors.
Integrating such responses with intelligence, hybrid, and cyber
capabilities would also be required for countering influence operations
and foreign interference. This terminology is escalatory. Foreign
interference can involve several influence operations. Influence
operations can include many examples of disinformation. Disinformation
can cause or be derived from misinformation. Institutional ownership
should be developed on this understanding; for example, the EEAS would
be responsible for countering disinformation spread by pro-Kremlin
sources on the grounds that such disinformation is part of influence
operations and a tool of foreign interference. ACTOR-SPECIFIC APPROACHES
The benefit of this approach is that misinformation and disinformation
are treated primarily as problems of democracy to be dealt with by
improving the health of public debate, while influence operations and
foreign interference are treated as security concerns in the context of
attempting to influence the calculus of adversary actors. This approach
also acknowledges that actor-specific knowledge is a necessary
foundation of the disinformation debate. The third paper in the series,
"Developing Policy Interventions for the 2020s," outlines the main
options for action, which are summarized below. Reshape adversaries'
strategic calculus: [The EU should consider its interventions from the
perspective of denying adversary actors the benefits of their actions in
addition to domestic concerns such as data transparency]{.underline}.
Interventions should be designed to influence adversaries' calculus so
that they no longer perceive disinformation, influence operations, and
manipulative interference as beneficial courses of action. Leverage
strategic communications and public diplomacy to dissuade adversaries
from using disinformation and influence operations: **[Some current EU
instruments, such as]{.underline}** the EEAS's Strategic Communications
Division and **[the East StratCom Task Force, make strong contributions
to developing societal and institutional resilience]{.underline}**.
Modern, data-driven strategic communications and public diplomacy are
central to maintaining and projecting these capabilities. To further
develop their potential, EU policymakers should reconsider how these
elements contribute to a cumulative posture aimed at dissuading
adversary actors from spreading disinformation and conducting influence
operations and manipulative interference. Situate disinformation
responses in broader geopolitical strategies: EU policy toward Russia,
China, and other identified adversary actors should be assertive in
integrating disinformation-related concerns into its broader engagement
posture. Policymakers should consider regulatory and nonregulatory
interventions related to disinformation not merely from a
data-transparency perspective but also from a geopolitical perspective.
Raising costs, denying benefits, and denying capabilities should be core
motivations driving policy interventions. Actor-specific capabilities
should be augmented where appropriate by integration with intelligence,
hybrid, and cyber resources. REGULATORY AND NONREGULATORY INTERVENTIONS
The third paper in the series, "Developing Policy Interventions for the
2020s," outlines a range of regulatory and nonregulatory measures that
should be developed into a coherent, comprehensive EU disinformation
policy. Nonregulatory measures are particularly important, as digital
platforms have multiple tools at their disposal for modifying user
behavior. Building on the results of the Code of Practice on
Disinformation, the EU should work with and better support platforms in
establishing guidelines on best practices that set clear standards of
responsible platform behavior aligned with fundamental freedoms. The
paper details several examples where EU guidance on areas such as terms
of service, terminology, promoting/demoting content, political parties,
and research collaboration could be beneficial to current and emerging
digital platforms, member states, and the international community. The
paper suggests the following: Design nonregulatory measures through
stakeholder dialogue: A range of nonregulatory interventions should be
developed on the basis of a collaborative, iterative, and recurring
format for policy and operational dialogue among different parts of the
stakeholder community. Craft guidelines relevant to the full range of
policy actors: Guidelines should be developed in multiple areas to
provide support and direction to stakeholders seeking to mitigate the
impact of disinformation, including digital platforms, member states,
civil society, and researchers. These would represent best practices and
would set expectations for the broader stakeholder community. The
European Commission will likely favor regulatory interventions,
particularly in areas where the voluntary code of practice fell short of
delivering the desired results. The paper on policy interventions
outlines an overall approach to regulation that places the onus on
digital platforms to fulfill a duty of care, while enabling independent
verification of their results. It suggests a differentiated approach to
data access, on the grounds that data transparency should be viewed as a
means of improving policymaking, not as an end in itself.34 This
approach includes the following tasks. [Establish a regulatory
environment involving reporting by and auditing of digital
platforms]{.underline}: The EU should establish a regulatory process
based around three steps: a statement of expected outcomes, a reporting
mechanism for digital platforms, and an auditing mechanism for
independent verification of results. [Encourage collaborative,
cross-sector research]{.underline}: The EU should support collaborative
models of cross-sector research and information sharing to enable
analysis of data made available by digital platforms, in support of the
public interest and sound policymaking. Consider regulations for
addressing social media manipulation: The EU should explore regulatory
interventions into the market for social media manipulation, including
demonetization of disinformation. Delineate duties and consequences
clearly: Definitions of digital platform responsibilities and the
consequences of breaches should be clearly defined. Such definitions
should maintain a focus on improvement, learning, and iterative
development of evidence-based policymaking. The overall package of
policy recommendations presented here is designed with a view not just
to solving European problems but rather to creating a default global
disinformation policy for democracies to adapt to local conditions. The
recommendations promote evidence-based policymaking based on a logical
alignment between terminology, interventions, and empirical data. They
balance concerns about fundamental freedoms with security and
distinguish between the types of problems that disinformation entails
and the types of actors that it involves. Interventions are designed to
reframe the issue in terms of influencing the calculus of adversary
actors so that they no longer perceive disinformation and interference
as a beneficial course of action.

Reviewing the European Union's new initiatives provides several positive
lessons on how to design policy [responses to
disinformation]{.underline} that **[go beyond tech]{.underline}**. Due
to the rapid development of the technology behind disinformation
campaigns, there remains a significant risk that the European Union's
response will lag be- hind the latest tools. [Disinformation has **a
social dimension**]{.underline} as well as a techno- logical one, and
any effective policy must take a holistic approach. In 2018, [the
E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [took **many important
steps**]{.underline} in this regard. [Through]{.underline} improved
**[interagency coordination]{.underline}**, [measures to **regulate**
the private sector]{.underline}, [and support for **media
literacy**]{.underline}, [the E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion
[is]{.underline} now **[on a path]{.underline}** [to build resilience
against disinformation]{.underline} ahead of the 2019 elections.

That is not to say that [there is]{.underline} not [room for
improvement]{.underline}. The mixed success of the EU vs Disinfo
campaign illustrates the difficult balance between involving a diverse
network of stakeholders and "outsourcing" information defense operations
to the point where they become unreliable. **[Rigorous
monitoring]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[evaluation]{.underline}**
[is crucial]{.underline} as a part of the process of improving
cooperation between sectors. Civil society has already provided counsel
to the European Union in this regard: [civil society should be
**directly involved**]{.underline} [in monitoring]{.underline} and
evaluation in order [to **improve accountability**]{.underline}.

Reviewing the [E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion['s policies
**provides an opportunity**]{.underline} [for countries like the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to draw lessons to inform
**their own**]{.underline} multi-stakeholder [strategies]{.underline} to
counter disinformation. [**While** the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [does not operate under the same legal
framework]{.underline} as the European Union, [the logic behind the
E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion['s]{.underline} raised
[ambitions]{.underline} to counter disinformation should certainly still
[apply **across the pond**]{.underline}. Perhaps most importantly,
[the]{.underline} "**[European approach]{.underline}**" [highlights the
necessity]{.underline} and difficulty of involving all parts **[of
society]{.underline}** in this fight. In 2018, [the
E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [has made]{.underline}
**[landmark progress]{.underline}** particularly [in addressing the
private sector and protecting personal data]{.underline}. The
effectiveness of measures such as GDPR and the Code of Practice must be
carefully evaluated both within and outside of the European Union. T[he
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would]{.underline} **[greatly
benefit]{.underline}** [from reviewing the results]{.underline} of such
an analysis to inform future policy conversations about whether [to
implement **similar measures**]{.underline}.

The disinformation challenge has always changed with the times and will
con- tinue to do so. [Learning from each other]{.underline}---[on
a]{.underline}n interagency or **[transatlantic
basis]{.underline}**---[remains the **best way**]{.underline} of staying
ready to counter it.

BRUSSELS --- [Big tech]{.underline} companies like Google and Facebook
parent Meta [will have to **police their platforms**]{.underline} more
strictly [to]{.underline} better [protect European users
from]{.underline} hate speech, [disinformation]{.underline} and other
harmful online content [under]{.underline} **[landmark EU
legislation]{.underline}** approved early Saturday.

European Union officials clinched the agreement in principle on the
Digital Services Act after lengthy final negotiations that began Friday.
[The law will]{.underline} also [force tech companies to]{.underline}
[make it easier]{.underline} for users **[to flag
problems]{.underline}**, ban online ads aimed at kids [and
empower]{.underline} [regulators to punish noncompliance with **billions
in fines**]{.underline}.

[The Digital Services Act]{.underline}, one half of **[an
overhaul]{.underline}** for the 27-nation bloc\'s digital rulebook,
[helps cement Europe\'s reputation as the **global leader**]{.underline}
in efforts to rein in the power of social media companies and other
digital platforms.

\"With the DSA, the time of big online platforms behaving like they are
\'too big to care\' is coming to an end,\" said EU Internal Market
Commissioner Thierry Breton.

EU Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager added that \"with
today\'s agreement we ensure that platforms are held accountable for the
risks their services can pose to society and citizens.\"

[The EU **continues to set** the **global standard**]{.underline} for
bridling Big Tech

[The act is the EU\'s **third significant law**]{.underline} targeting
the tech industry, a notable contrast with the U.S., where lobbyists
representing Silicon Valley\'s interests have largely succeeded in
keeping federal lawmakers at bay.

While the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have filed
major antitrust actions against Google and Facebook, Congress remains
politically divided on efforts to address competition, online privacy,
disinformation and more.

The EU\'s new rules should make tech companies more accountable for
content created by users and amplified by their platforms\' algorithms.

The biggest online platforms and search engines, defined as having more
than 45 million users, will face extra scrutiny.

Breton said they will have plenty of stick to back up their laws,
including \"effective and dissuasive\" fines of up to 6% of a company\'s
annual global revenue, which for big tech companies would amount to
billions of dollars. Repeat offenders could be banned from the EU, he
said.

The tentative agreement was reached between the EU parliament and the
bloc\'s member states. It still needs to be officially rubber-stamped by
those institutions, which is expected after summer but should pose no
political problem. The rules then won\'t start applying until 15 months
after that approval, or Jan. 1, 2024, whichever is later.

\"The DSA is nothing short of a paradigm shift in tech regulation. It\'s
the first major attempt to set rules and standards for algorithmic
systems in digital media markets,\" said Ben Scott, a former tech policy
advisor to Hillary Clinton who\'s now executive director of advocacy
group Reset.

The need to regulate Big Tech more effectively came into sharper focus
after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, when Russia used social media
platforms to try to influence voters. Tech companies like Facebook and
Twitter promised to crack down on disinformation, but the problems have
only worsened. During the pandemic, health misinformation blossomed and
again the companies were slow to act, cracking down after years of
allowing anti-vaccine falsehoods to thrive on their platforms.

Under the EU law, governments would be able to ask companies take down a
wide range of content that would be deemed illegal, including material
that promotes terrorism, child sexual abuse, hate speech and commercial
scams. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter would have to
give users tools to flag such content in an \"easy and effective way\"
so that it can be swiftly removed. Online marketplaces like Amazon would
have to do the same for dodgy products, such as counterfeit sneakers or
unsafe toys.

These systems will be standardized to work the same way on any online
platform.

Germany\'s justice minister said the rules would safeguard freedom of
speech online by ensuring sites can be made to review decisions on
deleting posts. At the same time, they\'ll be required to prevent their
platforms being misused, said Marco Buschmann.

\"Death threats, aggressive insults and incitement to violence aren\'t
expressions of free speech but rather attacks on free and open
discourse,\" he said.

Tech companies, which had furiously lobbied Brussels to water down the
legislation, responded cautiously.

Twitter said it would review the rules \"in detail\" and that it
supports \"smart, forward thinking regulation that balances the need to
tackle online harm with protecting the Open Internet.\"

TikTok said it awaits the act\'s full details but \"we support its aim
to harmonize the approach to online content issues and welcome the
DSA\'s focus on transparency as a means to show accountability.\"

Google said it looks forward to \"working with policymakers to get the
remaining technical details right to ensure the law works for
everyone.\" Amazon referred to a blog post from last year that said it
welcomed measures that enhance trust in online services. Facebook
didn\'t respond to a request for comment.

The Digital Services Act bans ads targeted at minors, as well as ads
based on users\' gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation. It also bans
deceptive techniques companies use to nudge people into doing things
they didn\'t intend to, such as signing up for services that are easy to
opt into, but hard to decline.

To show they\'re making progress on limiting these practices, tech
companies would have to carry out annual risk assessments of their
platforms.

Up until now, regulators have had no access to the inner workings at
Google, Facebook and other popular services. But under the new law, the
companies will have to be more transparent and provide information to
regulators and independent researchers on content-moderation efforts.
This could mean, for example, making YouTube turn over data on whether
its recommendation algorithm has been directing users to more Russian
propaganda than normal.

To enforce the new rules, the EU\'s executive Commission is expected to
hire more than 200 new staffers. To pay for it, tech companies will be
charged a \"supervisory fee.\"

[Experts said the new rules will]{.underline} likely **[spark copycat
regulatory]{.underline}** [efforts by governments in **other
countries**]{.underline}, while [tech companies will]{.underline} also
[**face pressure** to roll out the rules **beyond the EU**\'s
borders]{.underline}.

\"[If Joe Biden stands]{.underline} at the podium [and says]{.underline}
\'By golly, [why don\'t American consumers deserve the **same
protections**]{.underline} [that Google and Facebook are giving to
**Europe consumers**]{.underline},\' [it\'s going to **be difficult**
for those companies to deny]{.underline} the application of the same
rules\" elsewhere, Scott said.

[Space has become an essential domain for strengthening the capacity of
the]{.underline} European Union (**[EU) to advance domestic prosperity
and gain international influence]{.underline}**. [Space policy and
spacerelated cooperation have developed into an essential component of
foreign and security policy-related planning and decision-making. Europe
has joined a number of spacefaring states in the competition to derive
greater civilian, societal, commercial and military benefits from its
presence in space**. The EU now has a defined role in space-related
endeavours.**]{.underline} As Article 189 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (as amended by the 2007 Treaty of
Lisbon) gave the EU, for the first time, explicit competence for space.
[As effective operations in space require cutting-edge technologies,
large-scale funding, and multi-year support, the EU has been working
with its member states, the European Space Agency (ESA) and its
international partners to create a coherent EU space policy and a
systematic programme for its implementation]{.underline}. This
strengthened cooperation within the EU and beyond is founded on the
principle of the peaceful uses of outer space and encourages greater
transparency and trust among state and nonstate actors in space. In
February 2013 the European Commission presented five main objectives for
an EU space policy: 1. Establish a coherent and stable regulatory
framework 2. Further develop a competitive, solid, efficient and
balanced industrial base in Europe and support SME \[small- and
medium-sized enterprises\] participation; 3. Support the global
competitiveness of the EU space industry by encouraging the sector to
become more cost-efficient along the value chain; 4. Develop markets for
space applications and services; 5. Ensure technological non-dependence
and an independent access to space.1 Many space systems are dual-use in
nature (i.e. for both civilian and military applications). Accordingly,
the [EU Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and Common Security
and Defence Policy (CSDP) should play important and appropriate roles in
influencing the overarching framework or architecture for future space
activities]{.underline}. As the CFSP is within the purview of the EU
member states and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign
Affairs and Security Policy (assisted by the European External Action
Service, EEAS), it has important implications for the strategic nature
of space assets and their contribution to the security and prosperity of
the EU and its global standing. One indication of the important role of
space assets from an EU perspective has been the sustained investment in
developing three space programmes: the European global navigation
satellite systems---European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service
(EGNOS) and Galileo---and the earth observation programme Copernicus. As
the EU has invested heavily in space systems, it is appropriately
concerned with the need to strengthen space security, including through
the adoption of a normative framework for space activities. [The primary
goal for the EU is to achieve a safe, stable and sustainable space
environment that is embedded in a multilateral framework of space
treaties, guidelines and principles that reflect and codify a
multilateral consensus on what a broad architecture for space activities
should include.]{.underline} **[The EU has also underscored the need to
acquire the necessary tools to protect space
infrastructure,]{.underline}** and at several Council meetings EU member
states have called for the development of a space surveillance and
tracking (SST) system.2 In December 2011 the [Council called for future
operational capability at the EU level in the field of space situational
awareness (SSA) with 3 segments: 'surveillance and tracking of orbiting
objects, prediction and monitoring of the space weather
phenomena]{.underline} and their effects in particular on critical
infrastructure and Near Earth Objects (NEOs), within the definition of
an SSA capability, founded on the approved aggregation between civil and
military SSA user requirements'. To that end, [the European Commission
has proposed an organizational framework to establish and operate an SST
system at a European level]{.underline} that combines the existing
assets and expertise of EU member states with possibly new EU
capabilities to be developed. Today's more complex, congested and
competitive space environment requires new approaches to the management
of space, going beyond those envisioned even a few years ago. Given the
ongoing dynamic changes in the space environment, the final design of an
EU space policy, and the eventual global governance framework, must be
agile enough to respond to a broad array of contingencies in near real
time. [The EU takes into account initiatives put forward in
international forums---including the United Nations Committee on the
Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and the International Telecommunication
Union (ITU), which is the UN's specialized agency for information and
communication technologies]{.underline}---to address a number of
pressing space-related issues. Such [issues include dangerous orbital
debris, avoidance of destructive collisions, the crowding of satellites
in geostationary orbit, the growing saturation of the radio frequency
spectrum, as well as threats posed by intentional human disruptions. In
addition to agreed rules, transparency and confidence-building measures
(TCBMs) have been proposed as elements of a number of these
proposals]{.underline}. Taken together, [the proposals call for the
serious involvement of all spacefaring and aspirant countries, as well
as non-governmental and commercial entities, to advance a safer, more
secure and sustainable outer space environment]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} European Union ([EU]{.underline}) [**can be proud** of
what it has achieved in space]{.underline} over the past few decades,
and [space is a domain where the EU has pressed its **strategic
autonomy**]{.underline}. Despite initial doubts and suspicions by close
partners and perhaps even some EU member states, [the EU]{.underline}
forged ahead with its own space objectives and today it [can
boast]{.underline} Copernicus as [one of the **leading** earth
observation systems]{.underline}. Galileo, after only an initial service
of 2 years, has 1 billion users worldwide and the European Geostationary
Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) helps augment this. Yet, it is too
easy to become complacent. [The EU must **strive to
ensure**]{.underline} that [it matches political and financial
**commitment** to its ambitions in space]{.underline}, and [this
means]{.underline} also [ensuring that Europe's space sector stays at
the **technological frontier**]{.underline} [and forging a **common
vision** for EU space strategy.]{.underline} This is especially true
during the pandemic where there is a potential risk of financial
underinvestment, production delays and supply disruption. Strategic
autonomy in space may be lost more easily than it was achieved.

This study looks at the ways in which [the European space sector can be
an enabler of EU **strategic autonomy**]{.underline}. It asks how should
the EU understand space and strategic autonomy, what has the EU achieved
in space and how this has contributed to the EU's strategic autonomy and
what more is needed to enhance it. After looking at the growing
geopoliticisation of space, a shifting market structure and new space
technologies, this study argues that the [EU]{.underline} could gear its
space [endeavours]{.underline} to two trends that [are **growing in
importance**]{.underline}. First, [space is a geopolitical
realm]{.underline} that is increasingly [dominated by]{.underline} the
United States, [**China and Russia** and they are increasingly investing
in space for]{.underline} national **[security]{.underline}** concerns
[as well as]{.underline} economic **[competitiveness]{.underline}**.
Second, space is a technological frontier and the space sector is
presently subject to rapid technological shifts marked by quantum
computing and communications advances, nano technologies, advanced
manufacturing and robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

[This current geopolitical context demands that the EU **reframes** how
it sees its role in space]{.underline} -- [it lacks a **coherent
strategic** approach]{.underline} [and **vision**]{.underline} between
EU institutions and member states. This means that [questions about the
EU's readiness and willingness to engage in space]{.underline} from a
security and defence perspective **[are legitimate]{.underline}**. In
this regard, this study makes three broad recommendations to ensure that
the EU can continue to enjoy strategic autonomy in space. First, [the
need for]{.underline} persistent public [investments]{.underline} to
advance launcher and satellite technologies, ensure a greater European
physical presence in space through more missions, to initiate a new EU
satellite constellation flagship project for extensive and high-speed
broadband coverage and the technological advancement of Galileo. Second,
a need to harness the power of new technologies such as advanced
launchers, nano satellites and quantum communications backed up by
investments, technology roadmaps and supply chain [security]{.underline}
in order [to enhance]{.underline} the EU's [digital]{.underline}
transformation, connectivity, **[resilience]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} non-dependence. Third, [to plan for **geopolitical
competition**]{.underline} and space [by developing more space-defence
**dual-use** capabilities at the EU level]{.underline} and anchoring
them in clearly articulated military requirements. [The EU could use the

As the threat landscape evolves, [closer engagement between the space
and cyber communities will need to become permanent]{.underline}. **[In
the EU, this connection can be enhanced by bringing space actors into
the EU cyber dialogue to identify common risks and define appropriate
solutions]{.underline}**, even though the exchange and disclosure of
vulnerabilities is highly sensitive. **[Stress tests to assess and
improve resilience to potential cyber attacks can also become a regular
practice]{.underline}**, [along with the development of formal processes
to identify and compensate for when space systems or services have been
compromised]{.underline}. Space personnel will need to be continuously
re-trained on protecting and recovering the systems, software, data, and
devices they use. As the responsibilities and competencies of European
space actors have increased, their need for independent supporting
capacities has expanded. Reliance on commercial providers raises
questions about how to balance the needs for system control,
reliability, bandwidth availability, security, flexibility and
affordability. Reliance on other actors comes with additional risks for
both member states and European institutional users. [One tool for
managing these risks could be a permanent cooperative process to
research the costs and benefits of relying on commercial partners or a
single non-European provider for information and capacity in particular
programmes.]{.underline} **[Having autonomous and cutting-edge
capabilities for space access, earth observation, communications, and
navigation and positioning can help strengthen European autonomy of
action]{.underline}**. This work will need to go hand-in-hand with

Nevertheless, the [EU's tradition of support for openness and civil

The broad landscape of SSA activities and their importance for orbital
sustainability, as well as the changing operators and policy, mean that
[there are a number of opportunities for EU--US
cooperation,]{.underline} **[and for the EU to increase its capabilities
and become a key player in leading the responsible use of
space]{.underline}**. The one area in which potential opportunities will
be very limited, if not impossible, is military SSA activities.
International involvement in the US CSpOC is limited to the UK, Canada
and Australia, all members of the Five Eyes community, as well as France
and Germany. Any possible involvement of additional European countries
would only occur as the result of a larger intelligence and information
sharing partnership, although US Air Force Chief of Staff General David
Goldfein has stated that he expects the CSpOC to continue to grow.31 The
EU should therefore focus on the civilian aspects of SSA and the
changing landscape of providers. It [has been suggested by a number of
experts that SSA needs to become a civil mission with the military
augmenting and supporting national security programmes as their
mission.]{.underline} [That]{.underline} [will need a significant shift
in US operations]{.underline} (**[which is happening slowly) and a
greater sharing of data.]{.underline}** Data integrity and data trust
are essential. **[The concept of the EU SST as a civil programme should
provide the required momentum to help with this paradigm
shift]{.underline}**. However, some important issues need to be
addressed to support this. First, the civil programme should be the
primary goal. Second, [EU funds need to be focused on developing
sensors, capabilities and experience that complements and contributes to
existing activities rather than replicating what is currently
available]{.underline}. For Europe that means not spreading funds and
resources across a number of countries but focusing on only one or two
to support the rest of Europe. Third, sensors dedicated to STM are
essential, as one of the difficulties in space tracking for the military
is that many of its sensors are primarily focused on missile defence.
Fourth, [cooperation among EU contributors needs to improve and this
must be rectified before Europe can provide an effective support
mechanism for global SSA]{.underline}. As a multilateral organization,
the EU SST framework also comes with its own set of challenges in
cooperation and information integration between member states. It can
look to the EU Satellite Centre (Satcen)32 in Torrejon, Spain, as an
example of understanding and dealing with the sensitive nature of
aggregating national derived data and distributing it among EU member
states.

The complex governance of European space activities will not easily be
rationalised into a common framework any time soon. But [with a common
vision and good communication, major governance changes are not
necessarily required in order to pursue effective action on space
security]{.underline}. **[Building trust among all space institutional
actors can be facilitated through the creation of shared and common
European policies and strategies]{.underline}**, rather than just EU
ones. [A common European strategic approach to space security can
provide a pillar around which institutions, member states, and
industries can articulate their own policies and
activities]{.underline}. Such [a common approach could help ensure the
inclusion of space security priorities, such as resilience, space
sustainability, and effective data policy]{.underline}, within broader
space strategies and security strategies. **[This would also facilitate
the joint development of both technical and diplomatic proposals to
tackle and address space security challenges]{.underline}**. **[One key
element]{.underline}** to monitor space risks [is the development
of]{.underline} Space Situational Awareness (**[SSA]{.underline}**)
[capabilities]{.underline} for which Europe still depends on the US for
detailed information. The [EU has recently set up a Space Surveillance
and Tracking (SST) support framework involving an open consortium of
member states to network existing SST assets and provide anti-collision
alert services at the European level]{.underline}. **[Further
development of SSA capabilities would allow Europe to better respond to
the full range of threats originating in the space
environment]{.underline}**. [Closer cooperation on space security can
also be envisaged between the civil and military domains, taking
advantage of what each group has to offer without necessarily
reorganising the governance arrangements]{.underline} for European space
systems. Integrating the potential for dual use by both civil and
military actors into future space programme development can help
concretise this cooperation. As the number of private space actors and
the services they provide continues to expand, a framework for enabling
private sector exploitation of space could prove useful, including a
review of the regulatory bottlenecks and gaps facing new space entrants
in Europe. Incentivising security-conscious behaviour by private
companies and other new space actors, as well as reducing the
significant uncertainties and costs regarding insurance, financing and
liabilities can facilitate commercial activity in space.

[To systematically improve cooperation among European actors on space
security matters, mechanisms for regular exchanges can be established,
both within Europe and in its external relations]{.underline}. For
example, [a European Space Diplomacy Network composed of individuals
from the EU, the ESA, and member states]{.underline} (perhaps modelled
on the existing Green Diplomacy Network) [could help pursue shared
priorities and coordinate action plans for space diplomacy]{.underline}.
European effectiveness in pushing forward a space sustainability agenda
can also be enhanced when European space actors unilaterally implement
space sustainability measures. Such action may include, for example, a
public and independent review of how the EU, ESA and member states are
applying agreed voluntary measures. [It will also be important to bring
some space security issues into bilateral dialogues]{.underline},
complementing multilateral cooperation efforts at the UN. [In
particular, this can involve deeper connections with the United States,
who due to their increasing awareness of their vulnerability in space
have been led to focus more on diplomatic approaches to enhancing space
security. Dialogue cannot be limited to like-minded partners, however.
Russia and China can be difficult dialogue partners, but they are still
essential for shaping the space environment.]{.underline}

**[Global Solvency/Standards]{.underline}**

**Only the EU can create global solvency**

**Bradford 20**, the Henry L. Moses Distinguished Professor of Law and
International Organization at the Columbia Law School. (Anu, The
Brussels Effect: How the European Union Rules the World, pp. 25-26)

Only large economies can become sources of global standards. However,
[market size alone does not vest a jurisdiction with global]{.underline}
regulatory [power---or else the "Washington Effect]{.underline}" or the
"Beijing Effect" [would]{.underline} likely [exist alongside the
Brussels Effect]{.underline}. [Instead]{.underline}, unilateral
regulatory power requires distinct political choices made by a large
economy. The EU has become a global regulator not only because of the
size of its internal market, but also [because it has built an
institutional architecture that has converted its market size into a
tangible]{.underline} regulatory [influence]{.underline}. The key
stakeholders in the EU have further embraced stringent regulation as a
key toward a better society, giving the critical political backing for
an ambitious regulatory agenda. However, the EU does not exert global
regulatory power over any policy area it desires---market forces
successfully globalize some EU regulations but not others, setting
limits on the Brussels Effect. This chapter lays the theoretical
foundation for the Brussels Effect. It identifies the conditions for,
and the mechanism through which, the externalization of one
jurisdiction's standards unfolds. A careful examination of unilateral
regulatory authority suggests that there are five elements underlying
the Brussels Effect---market size, regulatory capacity, stringent
standards, inelastic targets, and non-divisibility. Existing literature
focuses on market size as a proxy for the jurisdiction's ability to
exercise regulatory authority over foreign entities.1 Large market size
is, indeed, a precondition for unilateral regulatory globalization. Yet
the jurisdiction must also possess sufficient regulatory capacity to
exercise global regulatory authority. This entails having in place
institutional structures that are capable of adopting and enforcing
regulations effectively. In addition, these regulatory institutions must
promulgate stringent regulatory standards, reflecting the preferences of
key stakeholders in the jurisdiction. A global regulatory authority is
also tied to a choice of regulating inelastic targets such as consumer
markets as opposed to more elastic targets such as capital. Only
stringent standards aimed at targets that cannot flee the jurisdiction
ensure that a country's regulations will not be constrained by market
forces or other jurisdictions' regulatory responses. Finally,
[unilateral standards become global standards only when the benefits of
adhering to a single global standard are greater than the benefits of
taking advantage of laxer standards in lenient
jurisdictions]{.underline}---in other words, when a target's conduct or
production is non-divisible across global markets. All of these [five
elements are needed]{.underline} for the Brussels Effect to occur. Some
of these conditions, such as [market size]{.underline}, are rooted in
jurisdictions' historical endowments and less dependent on decisions
made by either political institutions or market participants.
[Regulatory capacity]{.underline} and the willingness to promulgate
stringent rules typically reflect the political economy in the
regulating jurisdictions and are therefore a function of the affirmative
choices made by political institutions. Further, [inelasticity of
regulatory targets]{.underline} or non-divisibility of regulations are
conditions embedded in the nature of the global economy. They are driven
by the business considerations of private companies, leaving them
largely outside the influence of regulators themselves. This suggests
that the Brussels Effect emanates as a result of a combination of
bestowed market size, political decision-making, and market forces that
drive corporate behavior. These five elements underlying the Brussels
Effect are generic conditions for unilateral regulatory power, capable
of explaining any jurisdiction's ability (or inability) to regulate
global markets alone. Yet this chapter shows how [the EU is]{.underline}
currently [the]{.underline} predominant regulatory [regime where these
conditions exist]{.underline}, explaining why the EU---[and
not]{.underline}, for example, [the United States]{.underline}---wields
unilateral influence across a number of policy areas.

**The EU solves globally better than the U.S.**

**Bradford 20**, the Henry L. Moses Distinguished Professor of Law and
International Organization at the Columbia Law School. (Anu, The
Brussels Effect: How the European Union Rules the World, pp. xv)

By providing both a theoretical and empirical account of the EU's
unilateral regulatory power, this book provides a corrective to the
current discourse that portrays the EU as a weak and declining power.
The goal of this book is not to deny the various criticisms of the EU's
weaknesses or argue that such criticism lacks merit. The goal is to show
that the full story is much more balanced, and that in some very
fundamental ways, [the EU remains a powerful actor in the global
economy]{.underline}. In addition, this book also challenges the
prevailing narrative that views the EU as a champion of multilateral
cooperation and universal norms,8 painting a stark contrast with the
United States' unilateralism in international affairs. The Brussels
Effect shows that the EU's commitment to multilateralism and
universalism must be qualified. Like any great power, the EU is willing
to shape the international order to ensure that international norms
reflect its regulatory preferences---often multilaterally but at times
even more effectively unilaterally.9 The United States is also typically
associated with the pro-market views while the EU is seen as distrusting
the markets and relying on government institutions instead. However,
through the Brussels Effect, [it is the EU, and not the United States,
which best deploys the market forces to unleash its unilateral global
regulatory power]{.underline}. Consequently, this book demonstrates that
[the EU's greatest global influence]{.underline} may not be through
multilateral mechanisms and political institutions, but instead [through
unilateral actions, facilitated by markets and private
corporations]{.underline}.

For anybody who spends time in Brussels, one of the more baffling
mysteries in the self-styled "capital of Europe" is [the **lack of
communication** between]{.underline} the **[N]{.underline}**orth
**[A]{.underline}**tlantic **[T]{.underline}**reaty
**[O]{.underline}**rganization [and the **E**]{.underline}uropean
**[U]{.underline}**nion. Even though these vital Western institutions
are located just a few miles from each other, [there is a **striking
absence** of policy coordination between them.]{.underline} This, at a
time when [the European continent is confronting **multiple crises**
whose solutions will require **ingenuity**, innovative thinking, and
**smarter use of resources**.]{.underline} HAPPIER TOGETHER The need for
closer collaboration between the EU and NATO makes sense for several
reasons. There is now greater overlap in membership than ever
before---[22]{.underline} out [of 28 NATO countries]{.underline} also
[belong to the EU.]{.underline} European allies are worried about an
American retreat and want to see a reinvigorated U.S. commitment to
their security. In fortifying ties between the two organizations, Europe
could be reassured by an abiding American involvement on their
continent. And [deeper bonds between NATO and the EU]{.underline} could
have tangible political benefits, perhaps even to help persuade Britain
to stay in the EU. For the United States, this kind of initiative could
[**revitalize** the **transatlantic alliance**]{.underline} as the
foundation of our political, security, and economic relations with the
rest of the world. It could also demonstrate that the community of
Western democracies still remains our front line in defending common
values and interests in the 21st century. A new approach to Western
security cooperation---starting by creating a joint policy planning
council linking the EU and NATO---should extend beyond military thinking
and pursue more imaginative responses to current [threats]{.underline}.
Those [include]{.underline} hybrid warfare by Russia, [surging **waves
of refugees** from North Africa and the Middle East, pandemic
**disease**, **climate change**, and **economic
instability**]{.underline} on Europe's periphery. [Future security
challenges will **demand**]{.underline} more **[pluralistic policy
responses]{.underline}** that could be [best accomplished by
**combining** NATO and EU **assets** and **capabilities**.]{.underline}
In the fight against terrorism, NATO could work directly with the EU to
connect national criminal databases and use the EU's special powers to
seize financial assets of suspected criminals. The EU and NATO should
also collaborate to avoid conflict with Russia over the control of
energy resources and shipping lanes through the Arctic region. The
melting polar icecap will transform global shipping routes by shaving
thousands of nautical miles and up to seven days of travel time off
current itineraries through the Suez and Panama canals. For those
reasons alone, it is imperative for the West to prevent Russian
domination in the Arctic. Other regional challenges will require closer
NATO and EU cooperation. [The U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations
[predicts the world will need **70 percent more food** to feed a global
population of **9.6 billion** by 2050]{.underline}; some experts say at
least [**three dozen countries** could be **desperately short of crops**
or **fresh water** within]{.underline} the next [10 years.]{.underline}
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that by 2020,
between 75 and [**250 million** Africans]{.underline} could [face
**starvation** or **drought**]{.underline}---[which]{.underline} could
[trigger]{.underline} new [wars that]{.underline} might [require **EU**
and **NATO intervention**.]{.underline} GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY The United
States and the European Union are now negotiating a Transatlantic Trade
and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and hope to reach an accord next year.
While there are many obstacles to an agreement, supporters believe that
TTIP could help reaffirm Western leadership of the global economy and
serve as a kind of "economic NATO" in which the West could set future
standards for the rest of the world. Even today, in spite of the rise of
China and India, trade and investment flows between Europe and North
America account for nearly half of all global economic activity. A
determined drive to bring down the Brussels Wall dividing NATO and the
EU should accompany the push to reach a TTIP accord by the end of the
Obama administration. Doing so could nurture a more rational division of
labor between the two organizations. Today, member governments often
send separate and sometimes contradictory instructions to their NATO and
EU delegations. Such confusion can lead to chaotic policy responses, as
seen in the way Germany, Hungary, Serbia, Croatia, and Austria seem to
be working at cross-purposes in dealing with the tide of refugees
crossing their borders. The failure to deal with this crisis has
compounded earlier divisions between north and south during the
eurocrisis and sapped much public enthusiasm for a more united Europe,
in turn fueling a rise in support for populist demagogues who pose a
threat to political stability. GOOD FOR SECURITY Russia's aggressive
behavior in eastern Ukraine and threats to destabilize other parts of
Eastern Europe have infused new relevancy to NATO's role. But as an
institution bred with a Cold War mentality, [NATO]{.underline} still
[remains]{.underline} much [**too insular** and **dominated** by **rigid
military perspectives** when the nature of today's threats **require**
economic, cybersecurity, health, and]{.underline} even [social
media]{.underline} considerations. In the case of Ukraine, Western
countries decided early on that they were not prepared to risk a
military confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia. In the absence of a
military response, the United States and the European allies have
invested their hopes in a set of economic sanctions to bring pressure to
bear against Russia to seek a negotiated solution. The success of
Western policy in Ukraine is more likely to hinge on how much financial
support Europe and the United States can give Kiev, rather than NATO
saber rattling. [A **holistic policy approach** by the EU and NATO in
dealing with all of these new security threats would **encourage greater
contributions** from Western allies by drawing on a much **broader range
of resources** from member governments to find **effective solutions**.
By embarking on a **Copernican revolution** to reconsider how these
Western institutions can achieve more **unified missions** would give
both NATO and the EU a **new lease on life**.]{.underline}

The Great Irish Famine may belong to the nineteenth century, but it
carries undeniable messages for the twenty-first. It reveals the effect
of overreliance on a major food source, and even though few countries
today are as dependent on a single crop, many crops around the world are
vulnerable to the loss of critical inputs such as water, fuel, or
fertilizer, to disease, or to weather disaster. Any of these can unleash
a local or regional famine---and the famine, in turn, will release an
**[outpouring of refugees]{.underline}**. In a world as heavily
populated as ours, it is not hard to imagine how refugee tsunamis could
result from a general food failure in the Indian subcontinent, Central
Asia, China, sub-Saharan or North Africa, or Southeast or East Asia.
[Events of this scale are]{.underline} **[beyond all previous human
experience]{.underline}** [for the]{.underline} simple [reason that the
world has never been so populous or its resources so fragile. The
possibility of regional crises involving]{.underline} twenty, fifty,
even as many as two hundred or **[three hundred million
refugees]{.underline}** [must]{.underline} now [be seriously
contemplated]{.underline}. Such floods are unlikely to be stemmed by
military force. [They will alter]{.underline} the politics, demography,
and culture of [entire regions]{.underline}. They will change history.
This is the most likely means by which the coming famine will affect all
citizens of Earth, both through the direct consequences of refugee
floods for receiving countries and through the effect on global food
prices and the cost to public revenues of redressing the problem.
Coupled with this is the risk of wars breaking out over [local disputes
about]{.underline} food, [land]{.underline}, [and water]{.underline}
[and the dangers that the]{.underline} **[major military
powers]{.underline}** [may be sucked into these vortices]{.underline},
that [smaller nations **newly nuclear-armed**]{.underline} may [become
embroiled, and]{.underline} that [shock waves propagated by these
conflicts will **jar the global economy** and **disrupt
trade**]{.underline}, sending food prices into a fresh spiral. Indeed,
[an increasingly credible scenario for **World War**]{.underline} III is
not so much a confrontation of superpowers and their allies as a
festering, self-perpetuating chain of resource conflicts driven by the
widening gap between food and energy supplies and peoples' need to
secure them. RISING THREATS Round the world, defense departments are
already planning for what they anticipate as an era of rising
instability and threats as populations swell, resources become scarcer,
and climatic impacts hit home. Among the most notable examples is a U.K.
Ministry of Defence Strategic Trends study that, among other insightful
predictions, anticipated the collapse of global financial markets and
the U.S. stock market by almost two years. Relevant findings from this
report include: • increased risk of food price spikes and shortages, •
water scarcities contributing to tensions in already volatile regions, •
mass population displacement due to climate or resource scarcities, •
possible collapse in fish stocks, • increased risk of development
failure in some countries and "megacity failure," and • greater societal
conflict involving civil war, intercommunal violence, insurgency,
pervasive criminality, and widespread disorder (see map 2).32 Another
important report, this time from a U.S. perspective, is "The Age of
Consequences." This study explores the risks of a similarly destabilized
world, erupting out of three different possible scenarios for climate
change. Under the conservative scenario envisaged by [the
**I**]{.underline}ntergovernmental **[P]{.underline}**anel on
**[C]{.underline}**limate **[C]{.underline}**hange, this report
[anticipates "heightened **internal** and **cross-border tensions**
caused by **large-scale migrations**]{.underline}; conflict sparked by
resource scarcity, particularly in the weak and failing states of
Africa." Under severe climate change, it foresees that "the [**internal
cohesion** of nations will be **under great stress**]{.underline} . . .
both [as a result of]{.underline} a dramatic [rise in **migration** and
changes in **agricultural patterns** and **water availability**. The
**flooding** of coastal communities around the world has the potential
to challenge regional and even **national identities**. Armed conflict
between nations over resources]{.underline}, such as the Nile and its
tributaries, [is **likely** and **nuclear war** is
possible]{.underline}." The catastrophic scenario, the report simply
says, "would pose almost inconceivable challenges as human society
struggled to adapt," adding, "[**No precedent exists** for a disaster of
this **magnitude**]{.underline}---[one that affects **entire
civilizations** in **multiple ways simultaneously**]{.underline}."33

**EU-NATO cooperation caps every existential threat---hybrid war,
refugees, disease, climate, econ, terror, Arctic war, food wars,

For anybody who spends time in Brussels, [one of the]{.underline} more
baffling [mysteries in the]{.underline} self-styled "[capital of Europe"
is the lack of communication between the **N**orth **A**tlantic
**T**reaty **O**rganization and the **E**uropean **U**nion]{.underline}.
Even though these vital Western institutions are located just a few
miles from each other, [there is a striking **absence** of **policy
coordination** between them]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}, [at a time
when the **Europe**an continent is confronting multiple crises whose
solutions will require **ingenuity**]{.underline}, [innovative thinking,
and smarter use of **resources**]{.underline}.

HAPPIER TOGETHER

The need for closer collaboration between the EU and NATO makes sense
for several reasons. There is now greater overlap in membership than
ever before---22 out of 28 NATO countries also belong to the EU.
European allies are worried about an American retreat and want to see a
reinvigorated U.S. commitment to their security. [In fortifying ties
between the two organizations, Europe could be **reassured** by an
abiding American involvement on their continent.]{.underline} And deeper
bonds between NATO and the EU could have tangible political benefits,
perhaps even to help persuade Britain to stay in the EU. 

[For the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [this kind of
initiative could revitalize the transatlantic alliance as the foundation
of our **political**, **security**, and **economic relations** with the
**rest of the world**]{.underline}. [It could also demonstrate that the
community of **Western democracies still remains our front line** in
defending common values and interests]{.underline} in the 21st century.

[A **new approach** to Western security
**coop**eration---]{.underline}starting by creating a joint policy
planning council linking the EU and NATO---[should extend **beyond
military thinking** and pursue more imaginative responses to **current
threats**]{.underline}. [Those include **hybrid war**fare by
Russia]{.underline}, [surging [**waves of
refugees**](https://www.brookings.edu/2015/09/03/why-100000s-of-syrian-refugees-are-fleeing-to-europe/) from
North Africa and the Middle East, **pandemic disease**, **climate
change**]{.underline}, [and [**economic
instability**](https://www.brookings.edu/legacy/45B4C8F6-EDA4-483E-973F-3C6516242791) on
Europe's periphery.]{.underline}

[Future security challenges will demand more **pluralistic policy**
responses that could be best accomplished by **combining NATO and EU
assets and capabilities**]{.underline}. [In the fight against
**terror**ism, NATO could work **directly** with the EU to **connect**
national **criminal databases** and use the EU's]{.underline} special
[powers to **seize financial assets**]{.underline} of suspected
criminals[.]{.underline}

[The EU and NATO should also collaborate to avoid conflict with Russia
over]{.underline} the control of [energy resources and shipping
lanes ]{.underline}[[through **the Arctic**]{.underline}
region](https://www.brookings.edu/2015/08/27/russias-arctic-illusions/).
[The melting polar icecap will **transform global shipping
routes**]{.underline} by shaving thousands of nautical miles and up to
seven days of travel time off current itineraries through the Suez and
Panama canals. For those reasons alone, [it is imperative for the West
to prevent Russian domination]{.underline} in the Arctic.

Other [regional challenges will require closer NATO and EU
cooperation]{.underline}. [The United Nations
predicts](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=46647#.VgV75_lVhBc) [the
world will need **70 percent more food**]{.underline} to feed a global
population of 9.6 billion by 2050; some [experts say]{.underline} at
least [three dozen countries could be desperately short of crops or
fresh water within the next 10 years]{.underline}. The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change predicts that by 2020, [between 75 and [250
million
**Africa**ns]{.underline}](https://www.nrdc.org/international/files/peril.pdf)[ could
face starvation or drought]{.underline}---[which could trigger **new
wars** that might require **EU and NATO intervention**.]{.underline}

GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY

The United States and the European Union are now negotiating a
Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and hope to reach
an accord next year. While there are many obstacles to an agreement,
supporters believe that TTIP could help reaffirm Western leadership of
the global economy and serve as a kind of "economic NATO" in which the
West could set future standards for the rest of the world. Even today,
in spite of the rise of China and India, trade and investment flows
between Europe and North America account for nearly half of all global
economic activity.

A determined drive to bring down the Brussels Wall dividing NATO and the
EU should accompany the push to reach a TTIP accord by the end of the
Obama administration. Doing so could nurture a more rational division of
labor between the two organizations. Today, member governments often
send separate and sometimes contradictory instructions to their NATO and
EU delegations.

[Such confusion can lead to chaotic policy responses, as seen in the way
Germany, Hungary, Serbia, Croatia, and Austria seem to be working at
cross-purposes in dealing with the tide of **refugees** crossing their
borders. The **failure** to deal with this crisis has compounded earlier
divisions between north and south during the eurocrisis and sapped much
public enthusiasm for a more united Europe, in turn fueling a rise in
support for **populist demagogues** who pose a threat to political
stability]{.underline}. 

GOOD FOR SECURITY

[Russia's aggressive behavior in eastern Ukraine and threats to
destabilize other parts of Eastern Europe have **infused new relevancy**
to NATO]{.underline}'s role. [But]{.underline} as an institution bred
with a Cold War mentality, [NATO still remains]{.underline} much [too
insular and dominated by rigid **military perspectives** when the nature
of today's threats require **econ**omic]{.underline},
[**cyber**security]{.underline}, [health]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
even [social **media** considerations.]{.underline}

[In]{.underline} the case of [Ukraine]{.underline}, [Western countries
decided]{.underline} early on [that they were not prepared to risk a
military confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia]{.underline}.
[In]{.underline} the [absence of a military response]{.underline}, the
United States and the European [allies have invested]{.underline} their
[hopes in]{.underline} a set of economic [sanctions to bring pressure to
bear against Russia]{.underline} to seek a negotiated solution. The
[**success** of Western policy in Ukraine is more likely to hinge on how
much **financial support** Europe and the **U**nited **S**tates can give
Kiev, rather than **NATO saber rattling**. ]{.underline}

[A **holistic policy approach** by the EU and NATO in dealing
with]{.underline} all of these [new]{.underline} security [threats would
encourage greater contributions from Western allies by drawing on
a]{.underline} much [**broader range** of resources]{.underline} from
member governments [to find effective solutions]{.underline}. By
[embarking on a Copernican revolution to reconsider how]{.underline}
these [Western institutions can achieve]{.underline} more [unified
missions would give both NATO and the EU a new]{.underline} lease on
[life]{.underline}.

**EU conflict mediation is an impact filter**

**Regan 16** (Seán O Regan, Master's Degree in Commerce and Government

Dispute Resolution from Trinity College, Dublin, Higher Diploma in
Accounting, Business, Accounting, Tax, and Law from Dublin City
University, "Conflict Resolution Revisited: Peaceful Resolution,
Mediation and Responsibility to Protect", All Azimuth: A Journal of
Foreign Policy and Peace, Volume 5, Issue 1, January, p. 70-73)

Thus, [there is a well-rehearsed commitment to the principle of peace
and by implication the peaceful resolution of disputes]{.underline}. The
bipolar world order established after the Second World War made a
mockery of this commitment. The term [conflict prevention]{.underline}
in this era [meant **containing the potential for nuclear war between
the major blocs**]{.underline}. The [ideological struggle]{.underline}
between those blocs [was carried into **conflict all over the globe**,
notably in **East Asia**]{.underline} (Korea and Vietnam),
**[Africa]{.underline}** (the Congo and Angola) [and **Latin
America**]{.underline} (Chile and Nicaragua). [The]{.underline}
international community's [response]{.underline} was generally [to
insert peacekeeping forces]{.underline} between parties in conflict
[without]{.underline} necessarily [dealing with]{.underline} the **[root
causes]{.underline}** of the conflict. Many such conflicts [ended
with]{.underline} the collapse of the Soviet Union, but [long-suppressed
animosities]{.underline} between the constituent republics of
[that]{.underline} Union and its client states
**[erupted]{.underline}**. The international community's [failure to
deal with]{.underline} the [ethnic/sectarian conflicts in the
**Caucasus** and **South Eastern Europe**]{.underline} on the one hand
and the Rwanda genocide on the other [impelled discussion of conflict
prevention]{.underline} from academia to foreign policy formation. While
the UN and the OSCE had long-standing commitments to conflict
prevention, exercise of all possible options was in practice limited by
international politics. When it became clear that, as Smith12 put it,
the balance of terror of the Cold War would not be replaced by peace and
security, the issue of conflict prevention became prominent for the
international community. 3. Current Conflict Resolution Practice Van
Waalraven13 explored the conflict policies of a sample of Western
countries (Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United
Kingdom) and found that general conflict policy, as against specific
conflict intervention, was embedded in other, mainly development
assistance, policies. He found it difficult to identify generic
approaches to conflict prevention, although all countries examined used
similar language in their descriptions of conflict and its causes, even
if there was only vague consensus on what those causes are. The Council
of [the **E**uropean **U**nion]{.underline}, at its June 2001 meeting in
Gothenburg,14 [endorsed]{.underline} a programme of [conflict
prevention]{.underline},15 stating this [would "improve the Union's
capacity to undertake coherent early warning, analysis and action \[to
prevent conflict\]" and]{.underline} that "\[c\] onflict prevention [is
one of the **main objectives** of the Union's external
relations]{.underline} and should be integrated in all its relevant
aspects." [This]{.underline} document and the European Security
Strategy16 [provided the foundation for]{.underline} the [elaboration of
a whole series of policies, including]{.underline} the promotion of
**[mediation]{.underline}** in conflict prevention and resolution. It
was followed in 2009 by the "Concept on Strengthening EU Mediation and
Dialogue Capacities,"17 which uses the term mediation to encompass
improved communication, negotiation, dialogue and facilitation through
the offices of a third party, namely the EU. In this document mediation
can be directive and coercive. [It also notes the EU's **financial
power** and **moral authority** as **positive factors** in a
**mediation** process]{.underline}.

**EU [unilateral action]{.underline} is [key to soft
power]{.underline}.**

Brussels Effect: How the European Union Rules the World, pp. 24)

Finally, [being able to set **norms** globally]{.underline} allows the
EU to prove to its critics that it remains relevant as a global economic
power. Embracing the role of a regulatory hegemon reinforces the EU's
identity and **[enhances the EU's global standing]{.underline}** even in
the times of crises where its effectiveness and relevance are constantly
being questioned. If the EU wants to exert influence, it must do so with
the means available to it. [Lacking traditional means of power, the EU's
greatest **global influence** is accomplished through the norms that it
has the competence to promulgate]{.underline}. In the absence of
military power or unconstrained economic power, [the EU can exercise
genuine **unilateral power** most effectively by fixing the standards of
behavior for the rest of the world]{.underline}.80 In the world where
the United States projects hard power through its military and
engagement engagement in trade wars, and China economic power through
its loans and investments, the EU exerts power through the most potent
tool for global influence it has---regulation.

**Being the [first mover]{.underline} on [standard setting]{.underline}

The fast pace of innovation, our green and digital ambitions and the
implications of technological standards for our EU democratic values
require an increasingly strategic approach to standardisation. [The
EU\'s ambitions towards a climate neutral]{.underline}, resilient and
circular [economy cannot be delivered without European
standards.]{.underline} Having a strong global footprint in
standardisation activities and [leading the work]{.underline} in key
international fora and institutions [will be essential for the EU to
remain a global **standard-setter**. By setting global standards, the EU
**exports its values**]{.underline} while providing EU companies [with
an important **first-mover advantage**]{.underline}.

To implement this agenda, the EU will need to overhaul its ways of
working. Internally, it will need to find a method for operating with
the flexibility and speed required for greater diplomatic engagement,
while keeping the collective weight of the EU behind its initiatives.
Coordinating EU efforts with the United Kingdom after Brexit will also
be important. Externally, **[the EU will need to]{.underline}** make an
especially large investment in its relations with like-minded powers.
Conversely, it will need to **[develop a more independent posture
towards the US]{.underline}**. The EU should continue to cooperate with
the US wherever possible, but [it should put its commitment to the
rules-based order above its traditional instinct to follow the American
lead.]{.underline} Some Europeans will worry that an independent and
sometimes defiant attitude to the US will jeopardise the security
relationship on which the EU continues to depend. But Trump has shown
clearly that he does not reward concessions. Under his leadership, the
United States' security policy reflects its calculation of its own
interests rather than any concern for repaying allies' loyalty. [The EU
can **best manage**]{.underline} its relationship with the US and its
support for [**a rules-based international system** if it develops and
**acts on a sense of itself as** an **independent** strategic actor.
Europe needs to **set its own course** to secure the world order it
wants.]{.underline}
