[**Kurecik**, a radar station located in the Malatya
province]{.underline}, was used for three decades until the 1991 breakup
of the Soviet Union for NATO to counter ballistic missiles. [What makes
it **vital** for **NATO**]{.underline} \-- which Turkey has been a
member of for nearly 70 years [\-- is that the AN/TPY-2 radar (Army/Navy
Transportable Surveillance) deployed in Kurecik can **shield ballistic
missiles fired from Russia and Iran as well as protect NATO
members**.]{.underline}

#### Kickout compromises NATO BMD.

The matter of the possible 'closure' of the Incirlik base, which has
always been on the agenda in every turbulent period in Turkish-American
relations, has come up once again in the previous days. This time, the
new turbulent period started with the Turkish acquisition of Russian
S-400 systems and resulted in expelling Turkey from the F-35 Joint
Strike Fighter program. At a time where it is not still clear whether
the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA)
would be imposed to Turkey, President Erdoğan stated in his speech in a
live TV broadcast two weeks ago that, both Incirlik Air Base and the
Kürecik ballistic missile radar site would be subject to closure if the
USA imposes sanctions against Turkey.\[1\] Is this statement however a
ploy for domestic politics or is Turkey considering this option as a
trump card for international relations?

Unlike the Incirlik Base, which has lost its strategic importance for
many years, [the **missile defense early warning radar** in **Kürecik**
serves]{.underline} indeed [a **very important role** in NATO's
Ballistic Missile Defence (**BMD**) Mission]{.underline}. Therefore,
Erdoğan's wish to use this radar as a trump card may seem logical to his
strategy. But is that really the case?

In 2009 former U.S. President Obama announced a new approach for
regional BMD operations called the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA). The
first application of this approach is in Europe and is called the
European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA). For the first phase of EPAA,
an AN/TPY-2 X-Band radar was positioned in Kürecik, Turkey (a.k.a Site
K) and BMD capable Aegis destroyers deployed to the Mediterranean. Phase
2 involved establishing the Aegis Ashore site in Romania, which declared
its initial operational capability in May 2016, with SM-3 Block IB
interceptors, increasing the defended area significantly. Phase 3 of
EPAA involves establishing Aegis Ashore site in Poland with more capable
SM-3 Block IIA interceptors probably till 2020.\[2\]

In parallel, NATO decided at the 2010 Lisbon Summit to expand its legacy
Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) program and
wanted to alter it to a program that provides protection to all Alliance
territory and populations in Europe against ballistic missiles. This
mission was named as NATO Ballistic Missile Defence and the backbone of
NATO BMD was and still is EPAA. In order to understand the importance of
this radar for EPAA, therefore for NATO BMD, I would like to give a
brief, yet not so technical background information.

[When a ballistic missile is launched, it is initially detected by
satellites with IR sensors. Nevertheless, this **initial warning** from
the **satellites** does **not** provide **necessary** and **precise
information** to the **interceptor systems**]{.underline}. In this case,
[ballistic missile tracking radars like **TPY-2** come into play. This
radar]{.underline} thereafter [acquires the target and passes the
necessary information to the interceptor systems, namely
**Aegis**]{.underline}. [Aegis tracks the target missiles by its SPY-1
radar and fires the interceptor missiles (i.e. SM-3) for a '**hit to
kill**' destruction]{.underline}. Hence the [TPY-2 radar plays a
**critical role** in this **data network-intensive kill
chain**]{.underline}. But what happens [if this radar is removed from
the cycle]{.underline}? Could the ballistic missiles not be intercepted?

Yes, they still can be. However, [the success of the mission would be
**severely degraded**. Intercepting a very fast missile with another
missile is a very complex process that requires overcoming some
technical challenges associated with 'hitting a bullet with a
bullet'.]{.underline} The four key technical challenges in missile
defence are target acquisition, discrimination, interception, and data
networking. These powerful X-Band radars provide a solution not only to
early target acquisition but also discriminate incoming warheads or
missiles from the separated rocket booster stage or a penetration decoy.
[Target discrimination is essential in order not to waste interceptors
by shooting at missile junk or decoys, which is especially important
when we think how expensive those interceptors ar]{.underline}e.\[3\]
[Time is]{.underline} possibly [the most important factor in effective
discrimination since early discrimination and timely data relay would
**increase the probability of intercept**]{.underline}. Therefore, [when
we take out the radar in **Kürecik** from the cycle, the **probability**
of a **successful intercept** would be **reduced**.]{.underline}

At this point, we should not forget the fact that Turkey [shares a
border with]{.underline} a regional adversary, [**Iran**, which
possesses an advancing ballistic missile arsenal that puts Turkey at
**risk**. Turkey is]{.underline} indeed [within range of many of Iran's
short- and medium-range ballistic missiles]{.underline}. Furthermore,
NATO BMD officially defines the target as the threats emanating from
outside the Euro-Atlantic area and it is not directed against
Russia.\[4\] So, Turkey itself is, in fact, the primary country that
requires that crucial information coming from the radar for a successful
defence. Considering the relatively short ranges and fly times of
incoming threat missiles from the Middle East area, the Aegis ships
deployed into the Mediterranean in a possible crisis scenario could only
intercept those ballistic missiles when they timely receive the required
information. The available intercept window is very limited for a
successful kill and no doubt will be more limited if an attack may occur
to Turkey. There are some other onboard radars from Aegis ships and
Aegis Ashore systems. For a missile going beyond the west of Turkey,
those on-board SPY-1 radars may substitute the role of TPY-2 radar but
there would be a significant defence gap over Turkish soil.

[A possible scenario that could lead to the closure of the Kürecik radar
would **undoubtedly harm** the **NATO BMD**, which is
considered]{.underline} as a [very important and a strategic capability
by NATO]{.underline}. But most important of all, [it would stab the
dagger to **NATO's collective defence**]{.underline}. Many people
already think that Turkey's S-400 acquisition was a lunge against
solidarity. So [that kind of move would cause another **'crisis of
trust'** within a very short time.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Kickout Bad -- Radars -- US-Iran War

#### Iran strikes escalate and cause extinction.

Alex **Ward 20**, former associate director in the Atlantic Council's
Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security, Vox reporter covering
the White House, 7/8/2019, \"\"A nasty, brutal fight\": what a US-Iran
war would look like,\" Vox,
<https://www.vox.com/world/2019/7/8/18693297/us-iran-war-trump-nuclear-iraq>,
RMax

[A **deadly opening attack**]{.underline}. Nearly untraceable, ruthless
[proxies spreading chaos on **multiple continents**. Costly
**miscalc**ulations]{.underline}. And thousands --- perhaps hundreds of
thousands --- killed in a conflict that would dwarf the war in Iraq.

[Welcome to the **US-Iran war**, which has the potential to be one of
the **worst conflicts in history**]{.underline}.

The Thursday night killing of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who led
Iranian covert operations and intelligence and was one of the country's
most senior leaders, brought Washington and Tehran closer to fighting
that war. Iran has every incentive to retaliate, experts says, using its
proxies to target US commercial interests in the Middle East, American
allies, or even American troops and diplomats hunkered down in regional
bases and embassies.

It's partly why the Eurasia Group, a prominent international consulting
firm, now puts the chance of "a limited or major military confrontation"
at 40 percent.

But the seeds of conflict weren't planted with Thursday's airstrikes
alone. Washington and Tehran have remained locked in a months-long
standoff that only continues to escalate. The US imposed crushing
sanctions on Iran's economy over its support for terrorism and its
growing missile program, among other things, after withdrawing from the
2015 nuclear deal last year; Iran has fought back by violating parts of
the nuclear agreement, bombing oil tankers, and downing an American
military drone.

The crisis has become more acute over the past week. An Iranian-backed
militia killed an American contractor while wounding others in rocket
attacks, leading the Trump administration to order retaliatory strikes
on five targets in Iraq and Syria that killed 25 of the militia's
fighters. In protest, the militia --- Ketaib Hezbollah --- organized a
rally outside the US embassy in Baghdad where some got inside the
compound and set parts of it ablaze.

That led Secretary of Defense Mark Esper to tell reporters on Thursday
that "if we get word of attacks, we will take pre-emptive action as well
to protect American forces, protect American lives," adding "the game
has changed." The US killed Soleimani hours after that statement,
underscoring that change.

Importantly, experts note that neither country wants a full-blown
conflict, with President Donald Trump saying he prefers "peace" when it
comes to Iran. But [the possibility of war breaking out anyway
**shouldn't be discounted**]{.underline}, especially now that [Iran's
leadership has **sworn** to **avenge Soleimani**]{.underline}. "The
great nation of Iran will take revenge for this heinous crime," Iranian
President Hassan Rouhani tweeted Friday morning.

Which means [US-Iran relations **teeter** on a **knife
edge**]{.underline}, and it won't take much more to knock them off. So
to understand just how bad the situation could get, [I asked eight
current and former White House, Pentagon, and intelligence
officials]{.underline}, as well as Middle East experts, last July [about
how a war between the US and Iran might play out.]{.underline}

The bottom line: [It would be **hell on earth**]{.underline}.

"[This would be a **violent convulsion**]{.underline} similar to chaos
of the Arab Spring inflicted on the region for years," said Ilan
Goldenberg, the Defense Department's Iran team chief from 2009 to 2012,
[with the potential for it to get "**so much worse than
Iraq**."]{.underline}

How the US-Iran war starts

US-imposed sanctions have tanked Iran's economy, and Tehran desperately
wants them lifted. But with few options to compel the Trump
administration to change course, Iranian leaders may choose a more
violent tactic to make their point, especially after Soleimani's death.

Iranian forces could bomb an American oil tanker traveling through the
Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway for the global energy trade
aggressively patrolled by Tehran's forces, causing loss of life or a
catastrophic oil spill. The country's skillful hackers could launch a
major cyberattack on regional allies like Saudi Arabia or the United
Arab Emirates.

Israel could kill an Iranian nuclear scientist, leading Iran to strike
back and drawing the US into the spat, especially if Tehran responds
forcefully. Or Iranian-linked proxies could target and murder American
troops and diplomats in Iraq.

That last option is particularly likely, experts say. After all, Iran
bombed US Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983 and, according to the
Pentagon, Iranian-backed fighters killed more than 600 US troops during
the Iraq War. Taking this step may seem extreme, but "Iran could
convince itself that it could do this," Goldenberg, now at the Center
for a New American Security think tank in Washington, told me.

At that point, it'd be nearly impossible for the Trump administration
not to respond in kind. The recommendations given to the president would
correspond to whatever action Iran took.

If Tehran destroyed an oil tanker, killing people and causing an oil
spill, the US might destroy some of Iran's ships. If Iran took out
another US military drone, the US might take out some of Iran's air
defenses. And if Iranian-backed militants killed Americans in Iraq, then
US troops stationed there could retaliate, killing militia fighters and
targeting their bases of operation in return. The US could even bomb
certain training grounds inside Iran or kill high-level officials.

It's at this point that both sides would need to communicate their red
lines to each other and how not to cross them. The problem is [there are
**no direct channels** between the two countries and they
**don't**]{.underline} particularly [**trust each other**. So the
**situation** could **easily spiral out of control**.]{.underline}

Messaging "is often more important than physical action," Jasmine
El-Gamal, formerly a Middle East adviser at the Pentagon, told me.
"Action without corresponding messaging, public or private, could most
certainly lead to escalation because the other side is free to interpret
the action as they wish."

Which means [the **initial tit-for-tat** would serve as the
**precursor** to **much more bloodshed**]{.underline}.

"What are we going to be wrong about?"

You may have heard the phrase ["the fog of war."]{.underline} It [refers
to how hard it is for opposing sides to know what's going on in the heat
of battle. It's particularly difficult when they don't talk to one
another, as is the case with the **US and Iran**.]{.underline}

Which means that the way the US and Iran interpret each other's next
moves would mainly come down to guesswork.

Eric Brewer, who spent years in the intelligence community before
joining Trump's National Security Council to work on Iran, told me
that's when the Pentagon and other parts of the government rely heavily
on their best-laid plans.

The problem, he noted, is that [wars rarely play out as even the
smartest officials think they will]{.underline}. A guiding question for
him, then, is "what are we going to be wrong about?"

Here's one scenario in which the US might get something wrong --- and
open up the door to chaos[: After America launches its first set of
**retaliatory strikes**, Iran decides to **scatter** its **missiles** to
**different parts of the country**.]{.underline}

Now the Trump administration has to figure out why Iran did that. Some
people in the administration might think it's because Tehran plans to
attack US embassies, troops, or allies in the region and is moving its
missiles into position to do so. Others might believe that it was merely
for defensive reasons, with Iran essentially trying to protect its
missile arsenal from being taken out by future US strikes.

Without a clear answer, which interpretation wins out comes down to
which camp in the Trump administration is the most persuasive. And if
the camp that believes Iran is about to launch missile strikes wins,
they could convince the president to take preemptive action against
Iran.

That could be a good thing if they were right; after all, they'd have
made sure Iran couldn't carry out those planned attacks. But what if
they were wrong? What if the other camp guessed correctly that Iran was
merely moving its missiles around because it was scared the US would
strike once more? In that case, [the US would have bombed Iran
again]{.underline}, this time for essentially no reason --- thus looking
like the aggressor.

[That could cause Iran to retaliate with a **bigger attack**, setting
off a **spiral** that could end in **full-scale war**]{.underline}.

Iran could make a grave error too. Imagine Trump sends thousands of
troops, say 25,000, along with advanced warplanes to the Middle East in
the hope that they'll deter Iran from escalating the conflict any
further.

Tehran could just as easily read that buildup as preparation for a US
invasion. If that's the case, Iranian forces could choose to strike
first in an effort to complicate the perceived incursion.

Of course, cooler heads could prevail in those moments. But [experts say
the **political pressures** on both Washington and Tehran not to be
attacked first --- and not to be embarrassed or look weak --- might be
**too strong** for the countries' leaders to **ignore**.]{.underline}

"Unintended civilian casualties or other collateral damage is always
possible, and it is not clear that this administration --- or any
administration --- understands what Iran's own red lines are," El-Gamal,
now at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, told me. "As such,
the greatest risk of a full-blown war comes from one side miscalculating
the other's tolerance" for conflict.

If that proves true, and the US and Iran officially escalate their
fighting to more than a few one-off attacks, it's war.

What the US-Iran war might look like

At this point, it's hard to be very precise about [a hypothetical
full-blown conflict]{.underline}. We know it [would]{.underline} feature
a series of moves and countermoves, we know it'd be very messy and
confusing, and we know it'd [be **extremely deadly**]{.underline}.

But unlike with the path to war, it's less useful to offer a
play-by-play of what could happen. So with that in mind, it's better to
look at what the US and Iranian war plans would likely be --- to better
understand the devastation each could exact.

How the US might try to win the war

The US strategy would almost certainly involve using overwhelming air
and naval power to beat Iran into submission early on. "You don't poke
the beehive, you take the whole thing down," Goldenberg said.

The US military would bomb Iranian ships, parked warplanes, missile
sites, nuclear facilities, and training grounds, as well as launch
cyberattacks on much of the country's military infrastructure. The goal
would be to degrade Iran's conventional forces within the first few days
and weeks, making it even harder for Tehran to resist American strength.

That plan definitely makes sense as an opening salvo, experts say, but
it will come nowhere close to winning the war.

"It's very unlikely that the Iranians would capitulate," Michael Hanna,
a Middle East expert at the Century Foundation in New York, told me.
"It's almost impossible to imagine that a massive air campaign will
produce the desired result. It's only going to produce escalation, not
surrender."

It won't help that a sustained barrage of airstrikes will likely lead to
thousands of Iranians dead, among them innocent civilians. That, among
other things, could galvanize Iranian society against the US and put it
firmly behind the regime, even though it has in many ways treated the
population horribly over decades in power.

There's another risk: A 2002 war game showed that Iran could sink an
American ship and kill US sailors, even though the US Navy is far more
powerful. If the Islamic Republic's forces succeeded in doing that, it
could provide a searing image that could serve as a propaganda coup for
the Iranians. Washington won't garner the same amount of enthusiasm for
destroying Iranian warships --- that's what's supposed to happen.

Trump has already signaled he doesn't want to send ground troops into
Iran or even spend a long time fighting the country. That tracks with
his own inclinations to keep the US out of foreign wars, particularly in
the Middle East. But with hawkish aides at his side, like Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo, there's a chance they could convince him not to look
weak and to go all-in and grasp victory.

But the options facing the president at that point will be extremely
problematic, experts say.

The riskiest one --- by far --- would be to invade Iran. The logistics
alone boggle the mind, and any attempt to try it would be seen from
miles away. "There's no surprise invasion of Iran," Brewer, who is now
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in
Washington, told me.

Iran has nearly three times the amount of people Iraq did in 2003, when
the war began, and is about three and a half times as big. In fact, it's
the world's 17th-largest country, with territory greater than France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, and Portugal combined.

The geography is also treacherous. It has small mountain ranges along
some of its borders. Entering from the Afghanistan side in the east
would mean traversing two deserts. Trying to get in from the west could
also prove difficult even with Turkey --- a NATO ally --- as a bordering
nation. After all, Ankara wouldn't let the US use Turkey to invade Iraq,
and its relations with Washington have only soured since.

The US could try to enter Iran the way Saddam Hussein did during the
Iran-Iraq war, near a water pass bordering Iran's southwest. But it's
swampy --- the Tigris and Euphrates rivers meet there --- and relatively
easy to protect. Plus, an invading force would run up against the Zagros
Mountains after passing through, just like Saddam's forces did.

It's for these reasons that the private intelligence firm Stratfor
called Iran a "fortress" back in 2011. If Trump chose to launch an
incursion, he'd likely need around 1.6 million troops to take control of
the capital and country, a force so big it would overwhelm America's
ability to host them in regional bases. By contrast, America never had
more than 180,000 service members in Iraq.

And there's the human cost. A US-Iran war would likely lead to thousands
or hundreds of thousands of dead. Trying to forcibly remove the
country's leadership, experts say, might drive that total into the
millions.

That helps explain why nations in the region hope they won't see a
fight. Goldenberg, who traveled recently to meet with officials in the
Gulf, said that none of them wanted a US-Iran war. European nations will
also worry greatly about millions of refugees streaming into the
continent, which would put immense pressure on governments already
dealing with the fallout of the Syrian refugee crisis. Israel also would
worry about Iranian proxies targeting it (more on that below).

Meanwhile, countries like Russia and China --- both friendly to Iran ---
would try to curtail the fighting and exploit it at the same time, the
Century Foundation's Hanna told me. China depends heavily on its goods
traveling through the Strait of Hormuz, so it would probably call for
calm and for Tehran not to close down the waterway. Russia would likely
demand restraint as well, but use the opportunity to solidify its ties
with the Islamic Republic.

And since both countries have veto power on the UN Security Council,
they could ruin any political legitimacy for the war that the US may aim
to gain through that body.

The hope for the Trump administration would therefore be that the
conflict ends soon after the opening salvos begin. If it doesn't, and
Iran resists, all that'd really be left are a slew of bad options to
make a horrid situation much, much worse.

How Iran might try to win the war

Retired Marine Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart left his post as the No. 2 at US
Cyber Command in 2019, ending a decorated four-decade career. Toward the
end of it, he spent his time at the forefront of the military
intelligence and cybersecurity communities.

If anyone has the most up-to-date information on how Iran may fight the
US, then, it's Stewart.

"The Iranian strategy would be to avoid, where possible, direct
conventional force-on-force operations," he wrote for the Cipher Brief
on July 2, 2019. "They would attempt to impose cost on a global scale,
striking at US interests through cyber operations and targeted terrorism
with the intent of expanding the conflict, while encouraging the
international community to restrain America's actions."

In other words, Tehran can't match Washington's firepower. But it can
spread chaos in the Middle East and around the world, hoping that a
war-weary US public, an intervention-skeptical president, and an angered
international community cause America to stand down.

That may seem like a huge task --- and it is --- but experts believe the
Islamic Republic has the capability, knowhow, and will to pull off such
an ambitious campaign. "The Iranians can escalate the situation in a lot
of different ways and in a lot of different places," Hanna told me.
"They have the capacity to do a lot of damage."

Take what it could do in the Middle East. Iran's vast network of proxies
and elite units --- like Soleimani's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
--- could be activated to kill American troops, diplomats, and citizens
throughout the region. US troops in Syria are poorly defended and have
little support, making them easy targets, experts say. America also has
thousands of civilians, troops, and contractors in Iraq, many of whom
work in areas near where Iranian militias operate within the country.

US allies would also be prime targets. Hezbollah, an Iran-backed
terrorist group in Lebanon, might attack Israel with rockets and start
its own brutal fight. We've heard this story before: In 2006, they
battled in a month-long war where the militant group fired more than
4,000 rockets into Israel, and Israeli forces fired around 7,000 bombs
and missiles into Lebanon.

About 160 Israelis troops and civilians died, according to the Israel
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and about 1,100 Lebanese --- most of them
civilians --- perished, per Human Rights Watch, a US-headquartered
advocacy organization. It also reports about 4,400 Lebanese were
injured, and around 1 million people were displaced.

But that's not all. Iran could encourage terrorist organizations or
other proxies to strike inside Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
and other Gulf nations. Last year, it planned and executed drone strikes
on two major Saudi oil facilities deep inside the kingdom, convulsing
world markets. Its support for Houthis rebels in Yemen would mostly
certainly increase, offering them more weapons and funds to attack Saudi
Arabia's airports, military bases, and energy plants.

Experts note that the Islamic Republic likely has sleeper cells in
Europe and Latin America, and they could resurface in dramatic and
violent ways. In 1994, for example, Iranian-linked terrorists bombed the
hub of the Jewish community in Argentina's capital, Buenos Aires,
killing 85 people and injuring roughly 300 more.

That remains the largest terrorist attack in Latin America's history,
and the possibility for an even bigger one exists. In 2018, Argentina
arrested two men suspected of having ties with Hezbollah.

But Chris Musselman, formerly the National Security Council's
counterterrorism director under Trump, told me the US and its allies may
have the most trouble containing the proxy swarm in Western Africa.

"We could see a conflict that spread quickly to places the US may not be
able to protect people, and it's a fight that we are grossly unprepared
for," he said, adding that there's a strong Hezbollah presence in the
region and American embassy security there isn't great. Making matters
worse, he continued, the US isn't particularly good at collecting
intelligence there, meaning some militants could operate relatively
under the radar.

"This isn't really a law enforcement function that US can take on a
global scale," he said. It would require that countries unwittingly
hosting proxies to lead on defeating the Iranian-linked fighters, with
US support when needed.

The chaos would also extend into the cyber realm. Iran is a major threat
to the US in cyberspace. Starting in 2011, Iran attacked more than 40
American banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. The attack
made it so the banks had trouble serving its customers and customers had
trouble using the bank's services.

In 2012, Iran released malware into the networks of Saudi Aramco, a
major oil company, which erased documents, emails, and other files on
around 75 percent of the company's computers --- replacing them with an
image of a burning American flag.

In the middle of a war, one could imagine Tehran's hackers wreaking even
more havoc.

"I would expect them to have begun selected targeting through
socially-engineered phishing activities focused on the oil and gas
sector, the financial sector and the electric power grid in that order,"
Stewart wrote. "There may be instances now where they already have some
persistent access. If they do, I expect they would use it, or risk
losing the access and employ that capability early in the escalation of
the crisis."

Recent reports indicate that Iranian cyberwarriors have stepped up their
online operations, with a particular emphasis on preparing to attack US
firms. Among other moves, they're aiming to trick employees at major
businesses to hand over passwords and other vital information, giving
them greater access to a firm's networks.

"When you combine this increase with past destructive attacks launched
by Iranian-linked actors, we're concerned enough about the potential for
new destructive attacks to continue sounding the alarm," Christopher
Krebs, a top cybersecurity official at the Department of Homeland
Security, told Foreign Policy last July.

All of this --- proxies striking around the world, cyberattacks on
enterprise --- would happen while Iran continued to resist conventional
American forces.

In the Strait of Hormuz, for instance, Iranian sailors could use
speedboats to place bombs on oil tankers or place mines in the water to
destroy US warships. The Islamic Republic's submarines would also play a
huge part in trying to sink an American vessel. And the nation's
anti-ship missiles and drones could prove constant and deadly nuisances.

Should US troops try to enter Iranian territory on land, Iranian ground
forces would also push back on them fiercely using insurgent-like
tactics while the US painfully marches toward Tehran.

Put together, Brewer notes succinctly, a US-Iran war would be "a nasty,
brutal fight."

Aftermath: "The worst-case scenarios here are quite serious"

Imagine, as we already have, that [the earlier stages of strife escalate
to a **major war**]{.underline}. That's already bad enough. But assume
for a moment not only that the fighting takes place, but that the US
does the unlikely and near impossible: It invades and overthrows the
Iranian regime (which Trump's former National Security Adviser John
Bolton, at least, has openly called for in the past).

[If that happens,]{.underline} it's worth keeping two things in mind.

First, [experts say]{.underline} upward [of a million
people]{.underline} --- troops from both sides as well as Iranian men,
women, and children, and American diplomats and contractors --- likely
[will have died by that point. Cities will **burn** and **smolder**.
Those who survived the conflict will mainly live in a state of
**economic devastation** for years and some, perhaps, will pick up arms
and form **insurgent groups** to fight the invading US
force.]{.underline}

Second, [**power** abhors a **vacuum**]{.underline}. With no entrenched
regime in place, [multiple authority figures from Iran's clerical and
military circles, among others, will jockey for control. Those sides
could split into violent factions, initiating a civil war that would
bring **more carnage** to the country. Millions more refugees might
flock out of the country, overwhelming already taxed nations nearby, and
ungoverned pockets will give terrorist groups new safe havens from which
to operate.]{.underline}

[Iran would be on the verge of being a **failed state**, if it wasn't
already by that point, and the US would be the main reason why. To turn
the tide, America may feel compelled to help rebuild the country at the
cost of billions of dollars, years of effort, and likely more dead. It
could also choose to withdraw, leaving behind a **gaping wound** in the
**center** of the **Middle East**.]{.underline}

In some ways, then, [what comes after the war could be worse than the
war itself. It should therefore not be lost on anyone: A US-Iran war
would be a bloody hell during and after the fighting]{.underline}. It's
a good thing neither Trump nor Iran's leadership currently wants a

### 2AC -- Kickout Bad -- Radars -- Israel-Iran War

#### Israel strikes on Iran are likely and cause extinction in a Middle East war.

Sean **Durns 22**, Senior Research Analyst at Committee for Accuracy in
Middle East Reporting in America, 6/22/2022, \"Deal or No Deal,
Iran-Israel War Is Coming to the Middle East,\" National Interest,
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/deal-or-no-deal-iran-israel-war-coming-middle-east-203135>,

Iran, [Israeli prime minister]{.underline} Naftali Bennett warned on
June 12, "is dangerously close to getting their hands on a nuclear
weapon." In an interview with The Telegraph, the premier pointed out
that "Iran is enriching uranium at an unprecedented rate." Bennett
[added: "Iran's nuclear program **won't stop** until it's
**stopped**."]{.underline}

Bennett isn't alone in expressing concern.

The United States has also raised alarm. In a March 2022 hearing of the
U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) observed
that "Iran has made key advances" and has "decreased its \[nuclear\]
breakout time to several weeks from a year" compared to what it was
under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), colloquially
known as the Iran nuclear deal. Indeed, in April 2022, U.S. secretary of
state Antony Blinken said that Iran's breakout time was "down to a
couple of weeks."

On June 6, 2022, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, said that [Tehran was "very close" to
crossing the **nuclear threshold**]{.underline} and that it "cannot be
avoided at this point." Grossi also presented the board with a report
"showing that Iran effectively already has enough enriched uranium for
three bombs," the news service JNS reported.

Grossi also told the IAEA's board of governors that "Iran has not
provided explanations that are technically credible in relation to the
Agency's findings at three undeclared locations in Iran." Grossi noted
that Iran has also failed to provide the IAEA with "the current
location, or locations, of the nuclear material and/or of the equipment
contaminated with the nuclear material" that was moved from the site of
Turquzabad in 2018.

Adding to concerns, the Islamic Republic has begun installing advanced
IR-6 centrifuges at its underground enrichment plant in Natanz and has
said that it plans to install more at other sites. The centrifuges will
enable the Islamic Republic to increase enrichment by as much as 50
percent.

The agency formally censured Iran for its activities.

In response, the Islamic Republic called the IAEA "ungrateful" and cut
off the agency's camera feeds which monitor Tehran's nuclear activities
at declared facilities. This, Grossi asserted, was a "fatal blow" to
negotiations between the United States and Tehran over its nuclear
weapons program. But this overlooks some key points.

As Reuters, among others, has noted, the IAEA hasn't had access to the
data collected by the cameras for more than a year. The agency "hopes
that it will gain access to that data, which remains with Iran, at a
later date."

Hope, however, is not a good basis for policy---particularly when it's a
policy designed to prevent the world's leading state sponsor of terror
from acquiring nuclear weapons.

But while several analysts have pointed to a stall in U.S.-Iran
negotiations as increasing tensions and making a breakout possible, it
is worth noting the following: [the very terms of the JCPOA did **not**
prevent Iran from becoming a **nuclear power**]{.underline}. And
[**Israel** will **not** allow the Islamic Republic to become **such a
power**]{.underline}. It is that simple.

The JCPOA's sunset provisions and poor verifications regime enabled Iran
to eventually join the nuclear club. Indeed, in a 2015 interview,
then-President Barack Obama admitted that the deal would enable Iran to
have "near zero" breakout time in as little as thirteen years---or six
years from now.

But even this assessment was overly optimistic: the JCPOA did not
require Iran to come clean about its past nuclear behavior---thus
preventing an accurate benchmark of its progress. Similarly, the JCPOA
only allowed inspections at "declared" facilities. And it didn't fully
restrict research and development in key areas, thereby allowing Iran to
reduce the time of a nuclear breakout potentially further. This, of
course, is to say nothing of the decision by JCPOA architects not to
address Iran's other "malign activities"---code for its support for
terrorism and development of intercontinental ballistic missiles, among
other things.

The limits of that policy were highlighted in 2018 when Israel revealed
that it had broken into Iran's so-called "nuclear archive." The
findings, later authenticated by the United States, showed that Iran not
only lied about its nuclear program but was engaged in hiding it during
negotiations with the United States and others.

Iran may lie about its nuclear activities, but it doesn't always hide
its intentions.

Regime apparatchiks from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on down have called
for Israel's destruction. The history of both the Jewish people and the
Jewish state show that such calls aren't to be taken lightly.

In June 1981, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) successfully took out
Iraq's nuclear reactor. And in September 2007, the IDF carried out a
strike against Syria's nuclear program. Israel has been clear: it will
not tolerate a hostile power acquiring nuclear weapons. But this time
promises to be different.

Unlike the 1981 and 2007 strikes, Israel faces a more difficult security
predicament. The Islamic Republic has proxies wrapped around Israel like
a snake. Lebanon's Hezbollah and Gaza's Hamas are funded, trained, and
equipped by Tehran. And both have documented histories of using human
shields.

Hezbollah alone is widely regarded as the most well-armed terrorist
group in the world and maintains a global presence with operatives in
dozens of countries. And it has carried out attacks against Jewish
communities worldwide, murdering hundreds.

Similarly, Iran is also deeply embedded in both Syria and Iraq, with
capabilities to strike Israel from these satrapies.

In recent weeks, [Israel has carried out several **targeted
assassinations** in Iran itself]{.underline}, taking out top Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) operatives as well as nuclear
scientists. It is not the first time that Israel has taken out
high-level targets inside Iran. But the increase in strikes---nearly
half a dozen in less than a month---suggests a shift.

Ditto for Bennett's vow to implement the "Octopus Doctrine." The
[Israeli prime minister recently stated: "We no longer play with the
tentacles, with Iran's proxies: we've created a new equation by going
for the head."]{.underline} By letting Tehran know that it can and will
be struck, [Israel is **changing the rules of the game**. Jerusalem is
no longer content to "mow the grass"---an expression for strategically
limited strikes---but is upping the ante in response to what it sees as
a growing threat.]{.underline}

[Israel has also stepped up the scale and scope of its strikes in Syria,
recently hitting the Damascus airport]{.underline}. The IDF recently
held the largest military drill in decades, dubbed "Chariots of Fire."
In its own words, the exercises "aim to both increase the IDF's
defensive readiness and examine its preparedness for an intensive and
prolonged campaign."

In late May 2022, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) conducted drills which
included "long-range flights, aerial refueling and striking distant
targets." It was, the Times of Israel noted, meant to simulate striking
Iranian nuclear facilities. According to Israel's Channel 13 news, the
exercises spanned more than 10,000 kilometers and included more than 100
aircraft and navy submarines.

The IAF, the Jerusalem Post reported in early June 2022, can now fly
F-35 fighter jets from Israel to Iran without refueling. And now they
can be equipped with a new one-ton bomb "that can be carried inside the
plane's internal weapons compartment without jeopardizing its stealth
radar signature."

The IDF is, of course, an exceptionally well-trained military. It isn't
a stranger to major drills and exercises. But it seems clear that
something is afoot and the parameters of the long-running conflict
between Israel and Iran are changing. [Coupled with Tehran's imminent
"nuclear break out," such developments indicate that Jerusalem is doing
**more** than **mowing** the **grass**---it might be preparing to get
rid of the entire yard.]{.underline}

[Should **Israel** strike **Iran's nuclear facilities** it would likely
bring about the **worst war** that the **Middle East** has seen in
decades]{.underline}---if not longer. [The conflict that would follow
would look **nothing** like many of the **recent wars** between Israel
and Iranian proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah]{.underline}. For both
Israel and the Islamic Republic, [it would be an **existential
battle**]{.underline}, with the fate of both the Jewish state and the
regime in Tehran hinging on the war's outcome. [The **losses** and
**destruction** would be **devastating**.]{.underline}

Hezbollah is estimated to have 130-150,000 rockets and missiles and
Hamas is thought to have at least 30,000. Both hide their arsenals
behind human shields.

Indeed, according to a 2021 study by the Alma Center, numerous Hezbollah
military sites in southern Lebanon are "located in buildings within
populated villages and areas very close to villages." Researcher Tal
Beeri found that "each of the 200 Shi'ite villages in the area south of
the Zaharani River up to the border with Israel and the adjacent areas
have become part of Hezbollah's military infrastructure," constituting
part of the terror group's "regional defensive plan." Further away,
Hezbollah is also firmly ensconced in major cities like Beirut.

[And costs will likely extend **beyond** the **Middle
East**]{.underline}. [Iranian proxies have shown themselves to be
capable of attacking both Jewish and American targets throughout the
world. It also seems likely that a war will fuel anti-Semitic attacks in
Europe, the United States, and elsewhere---just as the conflict between
Iranian proxies and Israel did in the spring of 2021.]{.underline}

### 1AR -- Kickout Bad -- Radars -- AT: Erdogan Removes Now

#### Erdogan won't remove the radar.

Bahri **Kosar 19**, non-resident fellow at Beyond the Horizon ISSG,
12/26/2019, \"Who should worry first, if the BMD radar in Turkey is to
be shut down?,\"

RMax

Although Site K is crucial for NATO BMD, it is not indispensable or
irreplaceable at all. As it is a mobile platform, TPY-2 radar could
easily be deployed to another place, albeit with less effectivity. On
the other hand, U.S Navy is currently working on a new Air and Missile
Defense Radar (AMDR), also designated as SPY-6(V)1, which is allegedly
at least 100 times more sensitive than the current SPY-1 radar.\[5\]
This radar is expected to be deployed in Aegis destroyers in about 2023.
Besides, the latest version of SM-3, Blok IIA missiles are significantly
faster and have more range than their predecessors.\[6\] Thus, these
developments would compensate for the deficiencies emanating from a
possible TPY-2 replacement. Nevertheless, such a decision from a Turkish
government would more be a waiver from its own defence than a deficiency
in European missile defence. [I am not sure if Turkey would squeeze its
own feet but I think this statement from Erdoğan was only a '**butter'**
for domestic politics and not based on a rational reason.]{.underline}

[Despite Turkey's axis shift toward Russia and the rising 'Euroasianist'
tendencies among the security and government officials, I still think
that **Erdoğan's advisors** would try to **discourage** him from taking
**such a decision**, which would otherwise basically tear off Turkey
from NATO. Or at least]{.underline} I hope they would do that. Hope
never dies!

[America's presence in the Black Sea is important to check Russian
expansionism]{.underline}, **[but]{.underline}** [a more effective
strategy calls for a **coordinated response from regional allies** such
as **Turkey**]{.underline}. Turkey's relationship with NATO and the U.S.
in particular has been rocky of late. Ignoring warnings from NATO and
the threat of sanctions from the U..S, Turkey went ahead with its
purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense system, taking delivery of the
first shipment in mid-2019. But despite its growing defense partnership
with Moscow, [Ankara is equally uneasy about the growing Russian
military presence in a region where Turkey once had the
edge.]{.underline} In a 2016 plea to Turkey's NATO allies, Turkish
President Recep Tayyip **[Erdoğan]{.underline}** said the Black Sea had
become a "Russian lake" and [**called for a greater NATO presence**,
reversing a decades-old Turkish policy of keeping the alliance
out.]{.underline}

Turkey has developed a multi-pronged strategy to counter Russian
influence in the Black Sea. One important leg of that strategy is on the
home front, where Turkey is strengthening its navy. A project called
MILGEM, a contraction of the Turkish for "national ship" (milli gemi),
was launched to design and construct naval vessels in-country, including
ADA class corvettes. In 2018, the [Pakistani Navy signed a
contract](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/1178795282798202880?s=20) to
acquire four of these ships from Turkey's state-run defense contractor
ASFAT, the first successful export of these vessels. Turkey has also
been building up its anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities to
counter Russia's growing A2/AD assets in the Black Sea by ordering four
new frigates, called both Istanbul and MILGEM II. The frigates are based
on the ADA class corvette design but extended by 14 meters to enable the
inclusion of a vertical launching system for surface to air missiles.
The naval version of the
army's[ Korkut](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/970694646216249345?s=20) low-altitude
air defense system, Gökdeniz, will be added to the inventory for the
first time with the frigate. The
national [Atmaca](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/1191311364343681024?s=20) anti-ship
missile will also be integrated into the first unit of the class, TCG
Istanbul, which is forecast for entry into service later this year.

Balancing Russia through regional military cooperation

[Turkey is taking steps on the foreign policy front as well, **stepping
up its cooperation** with Ukraine, Georgia, and Azerbaijan.]{.underline}
Ankara views these countries as instrumental in its efforts to balance
the Russian military presence in the Black Sea and South Caucasus. Since
Russia's annexation of Crimea, Turkish-Ukrainian relations have expanded
significantly. Last year, Erdoğan unveiled a \$36 million military aid
package for Ukraine. [The two countries agreed to cooperate on the
design and manufacture of aircraft engines, radar
units, [drones](https://twitter.com/YorukIsik/status/1108309446034423808?s=20),
and navigation systems and consider collaboration on advanced technology
projects, such as ballistic missile systems.]{.underline} Turkey also
plans to sell its ships to Ukraine as part of a much bigger defense
deal, which, if it comes to fruition, could change the balance of power
in the Black Sea. Besides cooperation in defense industries, the
[**Ukrainian and Turkish navies**
also [conduct](https://www.newsweek.com/estranged-russia-turkey-and-ukraine-join-forces-447473) joint
training in the Black Sea to showcase their ability to operate \"**in
accordance with NATO standards**.\"]{.underline}

Turkey has also invested in shoring up the defenses of Georgia, another
Black Sea country threatened by Russia's growing influence in the
region. [Turkey
has [allocated](https://turkeyanalyst.org/publications/turkey-analyst-articles/item/652-turkey%E2%80%99s-commitment-to-azerbaijan%E2%80%99s-defense-shows-the-limits-of-ankara%E2%80%99s-tilt-to-moscow.html) millions
of dollars to the Georgian Ministry of Defense]{.underline} to reform
the country's military logistics and transfer defense capabilities to
its northeastern neighbor [while advocating for the **extension of NATO
membership to Georgia**]{.underline}, a move Russia opposes.

Turkey's defense cooperation with Azerbaijan has been growing as well,
which was on full display in the fighting in the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh late last year, when Ankara threw its full military
support behind Baku. Turkish drones provided Azerbaijan a huge advantage
in the conflict, which ended with Azerbaijan capturing significant
swathes of territory from Armenian forces. Turkey's military exports to
Azerbaijan rose six-fold in 2020, with Azerbaijan jumping to the top of
the list of Turkish arms buyers in September.

NATO and the Black Sea

**[NATO should support these Turkish efforts]{.underline}**. It should
also establish a permanent "Black Sea Maritime Patrol" group modeled on
the successful Operation Sea Guardian in the Mediterranean. Operation
Sea Guardian is a flexible effort that can potentially cover the full
range of NATO's maritime security needs. In accordance with NATO's
"framework nation" concept, [Turkey can be assigned the leading nation
role in the Black Sea and smaller members can integrate their own, more
limited capabilities into an organizational structure provided by
Ankara.]{.underline}

Mirroring other NATO missions in the Baltic or Mediterranean, [Turkey
can play a coordinating role to bring in other NATO allies willing to
participate and provide support]{.underline}. Such a force would
**[require NATO's coordination]{.underline}** and political pressure
among non-Black Sea members to commit in advance to a regular and
rotational maritime presence in the Black Sea, in line with the 1936
Montreux Convention, which limits the presence of warships from
non-littoral states to a maximum of 21 days. Although the development of
such a multinational unit would require a sustained diplomatic effort,
once active, [**it would boost NATO's deterrence** in a strategic region
that has become a springboard for Russia to project power from Georgia
all the way to Syria and Libya.]{.underline}

[The 30 NATO allies have signed off on the accession protocols for
Sweden and Finla]{.underline}nd, sending [the membership bids of the two
countries **to the alliance capitals** for legislative
approval]{.underline}, in a historic step brought on by Russia\'s
unprovoked war in Ukraine.

\"This is a good day for Finland and Sweden and a good day for NATO,\"
alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in a joint press
statement with the Swedish and Finnish foreign ministers on July 5.

\"With 32 nations around the table, we will be even stronger and our
people will be even safer as we face the biggest security crisis in
decades,\" he added.

The historic shifts by Sweden and Finland came in the face of Russia\'s
brutal invasion of Ukraine in February and other aggressive moves by the
Kremlin in the region. [Public opinion in the Nordic countries quickly
turned in favor of NATO membership following the invasion.]{.underline}

Every alliance member has different legislative challenges and
procedures to deal with, and it could take several more months for the
two to become official members.

\"I look forward to a swift ratification process,\" Finnish Foreign
Minister Pekka Haavisto said.

\"Thank you for your support! Now the process of ratification by each of
the allies begins,\" Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde said on Twitter.

**[Ankara initially said it would veto their bids]{.underline}**, with
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accusing them of providing havens for
Kurdish militants operating in Turkey and for promoting what he called
\"terrorism.\"

**[Following negotiations, Erdogan said he would drop his
objections]{.underline}** but indicated he could still block their
membership bids if they failed to follow through on promises, some of
which were undisclosed.
