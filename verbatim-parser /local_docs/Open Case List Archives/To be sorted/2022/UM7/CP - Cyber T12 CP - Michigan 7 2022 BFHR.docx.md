At the outset of the digital age, democracies seemed ascendant. The
United States and like-minded countries were at the cutting edge of
technological development. Policymakers were pointing to the inherently
liberalizing effect of the Internet, which seemed a threat to dictators
everywhere. The United States' technological advantage made its military
more potent, its economy more prosperous, and its democracy, at least in
theory, more vibrant.

Since then, autocratic states have caught up. China is at the forefront,
no longer a mere rising power in technology and now an American peer. In
multiple areas---including facial and voice recognition, 5G technology,
digital payments, quantum communications, and the commercial drone
market---it has surpassed the United States. Leaders in Cuba, Iran,
North Korea, Russia, Venezuela, and elsewhere are increasingly using
technology for illiberal ends, following China's example. And despite
the United States' remaining advantage in some technologies, such as
artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductor production, it has fallen
behind China in formulating an overall strategy for their use.

Almost in parallel, the United States and its allies have stepped away
from their tradition of collaboration. Instead of working together on
issues of common interest, they have been pulled apart by diverging
national interests and have responded incoherently to autocratic states'
co-optation of new technologies. Although officials in most democratic
capitals now acknowledge the profound ways in which new technologies are
shaping the world, they remain strangely disconnected from one another
when it comes to managing them. Coordination, when it occurs, is
sporadic, reactive, and ad hoc.

The liberal democracies are running out of time to get their act
together: whoever shapes the use of emerging technologies such as AI,
quantum computing, biotechnology, and next-generation telecommunications
will have an economic, military, and political advantage for decades to
come. But the world's advanced democracies have something the
autocracies don't: a long history of multilateral cooperation for the
benefit of all.

Because the issues are so diverse, what's needed now is not more
piecemeal solutions but an overarching forum in which like-minded
countries can come together to hammer out joint responses. This new
grouping of leading "techno-democracies"---call it the T-12, given the
logical list of members---would help democracies regain the initiative
in global technology competition. It would allow them to promote their
preferred norms and values around the use of emerging technologies and
preserve their competitive advantage in key areas. Above all, it would
help coordinate a unified response to a chief threat to the global
order.

AUTOCRACIES IN THE LEAD

Washington has struggled to develop a coherent vision to guide its
global technological role, but many autocracies have not. China, in
particular, has recognized that the existing rules of the international
order were largely written in a predigital age and that it has an
opportunity to write fresh ones. Already, Beijing is pursuing this goal
by quickly building top-notch capabilities and deploying them throughout
the global market, especially in areas where the U.S. presence is weak
or virtually nonexistent. In Zimbabwe, for instance, the Chinese AI
company CloudWalk is helping develop a national facial recognition
system, giving the local government a powerful new tool for political
control.

But forward-looking efforts such as these are not solely unilateral.
China, Russia, and other autocracies are already coordinating around a
self-interested global vision. They are shaping standards for the use of
new technologies in exclusive groups such as the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization, whose members have agreed to collaborate on information
security, robotics, and e-commerce, among other areas. They also work
through global forums such as the International Telecommunication Union,
where some of the same countries have supported international standards
that facilitate unaccountable surveillance. Unlike many liberal
democracies, quite a few autocracies have realized that technology,
including the power to innovate, set norms for its use, and shape the
institutions that decide how it will be employed, is not simply a niche
functional issue buried in a crowded foreign policy agenda; it is a
central element of modern geopolitical competition.

The United States, on the other hand, has been mostly reactive. China's
rapid progress in 5G, AI, and quantum communications has stumped
multiple U.S. administrations. Washington has no easy answer to China's
so-called Digital Silk Road, an array of technological infrastructure
projects to accompany the construction projects of its Belt and Road
Initiative, nor does it have an answer to the country's campaign to
establish a digital currency. The United States and its allies have
consistently struggled to define the rules of engagement around
cyberattacks and have responded inadequately to the use of technologies
by autocracies to oppress their people. U.S. officials often complain
about Beijing's dominance in technical standard setting and allies'
deferential attitude toward Chinese infrastructure. But they have had a
difficult time changing the nature of the game.

This is a multinational failure. Liberal democracies around the world
simply do not work together on many of the issues that should unite
them. Their responses to autocracies' abuse of technology tend to be
fragmented. National interests diverge, disagreements among states
arise, and nothing gets done. Within countries, paralysis often occurs
as domestic authorities clash with their national security counterparts
over how to deal with election meddling, disinformation, and hacking.
Instead of pursuing broad collaboration, the liberal democracies have
come up with a patchwork of discrete responses: Canada and France's
collaboration on an expert panel tasked with monitoring developments in
AI policy, for example, or NATO's pursuit of a cyber-deterrence
doctrine.

The dispute over the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei's 5G
capabilities is perhaps the best example of democracies' inconsistent
response. Following Australia's initial lead, the United States took a
hard line against the company, banning Huawei components from its
national 5G network and forbidding U.S. entities from doing business of
any sort with it. The United States proceeded to insist that other
democracies follow suit, even threatening to withhold critical
intelligence from allies if they adopted Huawei products. Still,
Washington remains relatively isolated in its opposition. Many
governments continue to resist U.S. pressure, pointing out that there is
no low-cost, one-stop-shop alternative to Huawei's technology. Even
Canada and South Korea, close U.S. allies, have defied Washington and
are considering Huawei equipment for their 5G infrastructure.

The democracies have come up with a similarly disjointed response to
Russia's election meddling. Although the Kremlin has interfered in the
elections of multiple countries, the problem has largely been treated as
a national one, deserving of only a unilateral response from any given
target. When Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,
only the United States responded with punitive measures. Likewise,
Russia's reported meddling in this year's U.S. presidential election has
so far not produced any unified reaction. Compare that to the response
to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its poisoning of a former
intelligence officer and his daughter in the United Kingdom. In those
cases, the major democracies coordinated a joint response, imposing new
sanctions and expelling Russian diplomats.

FROM MANY, ONE

Although the democracies currently suffer from a deficit of cooperation,
their capacity to work together endures. Here, history offers useful
guidance. In 1973, U.S. Treasury Secretary George Shultz convened the
finance ministers of France, the United Kingdom, and West Germany in the
White House library for informal talks. This "Library Group" quickly
added Japan to become the G-5 and later included first Italy and then
Canada to become the G-7. In the decades that followed, this informal
group of advanced liberal democracies, which for 16 years included
Russia as the G-8, would emerge as a powerful international force. Among
other issues, the group coordinated its members' responses to 9/11 and
to the 2008 global financial crisis.

Just as the G-7 came to guide multilateral action among the world's
leading economies, a set of techno-democracies---countries with top
technology sectors, advanced economies, and a commitment to liberal
democracy---must take action on contemporary digital issues. So far,
these leading states have acted independently, but their combined market
power and national strength would make them a potent unified force.

For now, 12 countries stand out for inclusion in such a group. The
United States is arguably still the world's leading technological power,
and France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom all have large
economies and impressive technology sectors. Australia, Canada, and
South Korea have smaller economies, but they are also important players
in technology. The same is true of Finland and Sweden, which are
telecommunications and engineering powerhouses. India and Israel are
also logical candidates for membership, owing to the global reach of
their flourishing technology and startup sectors.

Given the deep need for coordination among like-minded states, this
"T-12" group of techno-democracies would fill a yawning gap in modern
technological and geopolitical competition. The T-12's members would
undoubtedly disagree on many issues, but the group could provide a
critical venue for them to air their grievances. The United States, in
particular, should welcome the participation of others, since their
presence at the negotiating table would not only improve its digital
advantage but also reduce the sense among these countries that they are
merely pawns, rather than partners, in a U.S.-Chinese superpower
competition.

The most logical structure for the T-12 is an informal group of states,
not a secretariat-laden international organization or an alliance with a
mutual defense agreement. Although critics often dismiss gatherings such
as the G-20 and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation as once-a-year
opportunities for heads of state to gather for a few hours, don an
ethnically unique shirt, jawbone, and take a group photo, this is a
misleading stereotype. Such groupings have in fact been highly effective
at marshaling multilateral action.

In the wake of 9/11, for instance, G-8 summits produced specific
commitments to prevent a repeat attack. It is thanks to the actions
taken then that modern commercial aircraft have hardened cockpit doors,
major international ports screen cargo containers for dangerous
materials, and nations restrict the export of portable surface-to-air
missiles. The G-8 was also at the forefront of public health efforts. In
2001, the group established the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis
and Malaria, which has saved millions of lives through investments in
research and global health programs. And after the 2008 financial
crisis, the G-20 committed to a \$5 trillion stimulus package and
proposed new financial regulations, helping contain the subsequent
recession's damage and prevent another crash.

The government leaders or ministers who meet as the T-12 would also have
a unique opportunity to enlist the private sector and international
organizations in their work. Annual meetings could serve as an arena for
business leaders to join government officials in coordinating responses
to emerging issues such as the need to improve remote-learning
technology in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and what the future of
counterterrorism might look like. The format for these meetings could
include issue-based sessions, in which governments invite leading
private-sector figures for focused discussions, or standing forums akin
to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation's Business Advisory Council,
which provides advice to Pacific Rim leaders on concerns facing
businesses throughout the region. The T-12 could also develop working
groups and committees on the multistakeholder model, which brings
together representatives from business, civil society, government, and
research institutions. These groups would then pass recommendations up
to ministers and principals. Simultaneously, leaders could collaborate
with other multilateral organizations---working with NATO on AI
security, for instance, or with the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development on the industrial implications of disruptive
technologies.

AN INITIAL AGENDA

The success of the T-12 will inevitably hinge on its ability to
translate its conceptual appeal into the nuts and bolts of executing a
real agenda. One task its members could start with is information
sharing. Within the T-12, governments could update one another on the
security of supply chains, particularly in critical sectors such as
semiconductors, where China aims to dramatically reduce the portion of
the market currently controlled by American, Dutch, and Japanese firms.
They could conduct audits of supply chains that cross international
boundaries, especially those that include Chinese-made components or
software. Members could compare their assessments of the risks of
China's 5G technology, examine advances in quantum computing,
investigate AI safety, and share strategies for preventing the theft of
intellectual property. In a more ambitious step, they could exchange
information about online propaganda, disinformation, the integrity of
academic research, and specific ways in which autocratic regimes employ
technology to erode liberal democracy.

Setting standards for the use of emerging technologies would be another
crucial job for the T-12. The countries and companies producing the most
advanced technology have a valuable first-mover advantage: they can set
guidelines for how they expect their products to be used. Facial
recognition software would be a good test case for the T-12's potential
on this front. This technology is already being used for surveillance
purposes, including by the Chinese government to monitor Uighur Muslims
in Xinjiang and by Moscow to link photographs with social media
accounts. The leading democracies have yet to agree on rules for using
facial recognition technology, including its proper role in the criminal
justice system, or the protocols that should govern data collection. The
T-12 could address this by exploring how such technology could be used
to secure large events or assist in law enforcement investigations, but
not as a means of social control or mass intimidation.

Autocracies have realized that technology is a central element of modern
geopolitical competition.

Beyond helping the democracies get on the same page as they compete with
China, the T-12 could also serve as a way for members to air differences
within the group itself. Europeans might object, for instance, to the
fact that Israel's NSO Group, a controversial technology firm known for
its spyware products, sells smartphone surveillance tools to
autocracies, and the Americans may disagree with the EU's focus on
privacy when it infringes on free expression. The democracies have
varied approaches to data protection, privacy, and free speech. The T-12
would allow them to explore these differences, with the ultimate aim of
establishing broad principles, understanding disagreements, and
narrowing the gaps between participants.

Coordinating investments would represent another natural function of the
T-12. Members could rationalize their allocation of resources to
innovation and R & D and to securing supply chains. They could even make
concrete financial commitments to counter China's Digital Silk Road and
5G capabilities and launch joint projects in such areas as quantum
computing, cybersecurity, and tools for detecting AI-generated
counterfeit images or videos known as "deepfakes." In the realm of more
speculative technologies, it could examine advances in 3-D printing,
potentially unbreakable encryption methods based on quantum mechanics,
and microscopic sensing technology. More ambitious still, it might
launch a joint fund to extend loans and loan guarantees to developing
nations that seek trusted 5G equipment and other technology that accords
with liberal values.

Finally, the T-12 could serve as a forum for coordinating policy.
Members might harmonize their export controls on cyber-surveillance
tools; regulate the use of blockchain, a digital ledger of global
transactions, to ensure the integrity of supply chains when it comes to
sectors such as defense manufacturing and medical equipment; generate
common standards for a variety of 3-D printing methods; and even
coordinate their education and immigration policies to develop and
retain top technology talent. More broadly, the T-12 should articulate a
vision of the future based on innovation, freedom, democratic
collaboration, and liberal values.

BIGGER AND BOLDER

Over time, the T-12 could expand and transform, just as the G-5 became
the G-7 and then, temporarily, the G-8. Starting with the initial 12,
the T-12 should aim for around 20 members within five years. Additional
individual European states, such as Italy and the Netherlands, could be
asked to join, without the complexity of including the European Union
itself as a member. In Latin America, Brazil and Chile would make
obvious candidates, and in Africa, members could include Kenya, Nigeria,
and South Africa. Taiwan would also be a useful participant, even if
creative diplomacy might be required to deal with the island's nonstate
status.

The T-12's agenda should similarly grow in ambition. Moving beyond its
initial objectives, the group could branch out into securing the supply
chains for semiconductors. Doing so would involve multilateral export
controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment and technology, an
area in which the techno-democracies have a significant lead over China
and others. As part of this effort, they could create an international
chip fabrication consortium to move semiconductor production out of
China and into a T-12 country and provide shared financing for the
billions of dollars such a move would require. And as the world faces
diminishing returns in the growth of computing power due to the physical
limits of existing materials, the group could launch joint R & D
projects devoted to a new generation of microelectronics that might
jump-start an increase in computing power again.

Technology is too important to be left to the technologists.

As its portfolio grows, the T-12 should also take a multinational
approach to 5G networks. The current telecommunications equipment sector
is a Huawei-dominated oligopoly. This presents a major supply chain and
security risk, yet China's state subsidies make it difficult for others
to enter the market. The T-12 could support non-Huawei companies, such
as Ericsson, Nokia, and Samsung, as they transition to using an open
radio access network, or O-RAN, which relies on open interfaces rather
than proprietary equipment. This would allow multiple vendors to supply
the market with interchangeable telecommunications components. In the
future, it could collaborate on 6G alternatives to Chinese hardware well
before they are necessary, helping avoid the very dilemma many economies
are now facing with 5G.

The T-12 could also develop the framework for a digital currency that
preserves the central role of the U.S. dollar in the global financial
system. That role is under threat. China's central bank is already
piloting a digital currency program. If the effort succeeds, China is
likely to extend its use to countries that participate in its Belt and
Road Initiative, expanding the renminbi's reach as an international
medium of exchange and possibly threatening the dollar's preeminent
status. Pursuing a secure digital dollar-based platform would level this
playing field, making it faster and easier to accomplish tasks such as
moving money between banks, trading oil futures, and tracking money
laundering.

Beyond this, the T-12's members could develop and adopt a
cyber-deterrence doctrine. The world faces a perpetual threat from
cyberattacks, given the low barriers to entry and the difficulty of
attributing an attack to a defined actor. To tackle the threat, the T-12
could lay out uniform standards for appropriate behavior in cyberspace
and define what constitutes a proportionate response to a cyberattack.
Members could cooperate in detecting and measuring attacks by increasing
information sharing and establishing early warning mechanisms, then work
together to attribute violations to a particular aggressor. And once a
culprit is identified, the T-12 could coordinate a joint response.

ADDRESSING THE SKEPTICS

Objections to a T-12 are easy to imagine. The most obvious would be
general opposition to any new international grouping, which would join a
raft of existing multilateral organizations, some of which are obsolete.
Yet the T-12's novelty is what makes it relevant. There is no group of
advanced democracies to coordinate technology policy: the G-7 leaves out
important technology leaders, and the G-20 includes the illiberal states
of China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. NATO is a military alliance
focused first and foremost on European security. The Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, with 37 member states, is too
large and lacks the track record to break ground on technological
issues. The T-12, by contrast, would bring together the right members
while elevating technology to a level commensurate with such issues as
European security and global economic policy.

The private sector's role in a potential T-12 raises another question:
Why would any business participate in a government-driven process? The
answer is that it would make economic sense. Consider the inevitable
restructuring and geographic diversification of supply chains that will
almost certainly follow the coronavirus pandemic. Already, governments
and firms are considering reshoring pharmaceutical and medical device
production, and firms that are facing factory shutdowns due to the
pandemic are rediscovering the merits of diverse supply chains.
Multilateral coordination among national governments would make this
process less disruptive, costly, and lengthy than it would otherwise be.

Then there is the likely reaction of China and Russia. Wouldn't a new
group of techno-democracies merely provoke them? Indeed, they probably
would treat it as a threat, but the cost of forgoing cooperation among
liberal democracies is far higher than the consequences of any pushback.
As the COVID-19 pandemic has proved, when liberal democracies fail to
work together, whether, in this case, in harmonizing travel
restrictions, employing disease-mitigation measures, or assisting poorer
nations, China benefits. The T-12 should not ignore illiberal states,
and it can try to work with them on issues such as AI safety or
technological responses to climate change. But it should tread carefully
and limit their involvement. Ultimately, the world will be safer, more
stable, and freer if liberal democracies stick together.

A final objection would be based on realism. Cooperation in other
fields---global health, say, or economic policy---is hard enough, and
the likelihood of building a successful body focused on technological
collaboration may be low. Indeed, one should not overstate the degree of
like-mindedness among any group of sovereign states, democracies or not.
But that is a reason to experiment with new structures to deal with
tough problems, rather than rely on either outdated mechanisms or an
every-country-for-itself approach. The status quo is not sustainable. If
the democracies fail to act, technology will help shift the balance of
economic, military, and political power in favor of autocracies.

TIME FOR ACTION

In July 1944, delegates of the Allied countries came together in New
Hampshire for what became known as the Bretton Woods conference. After
discussions of various technical issues and sweeping foreign policy
debates, the conference produced a blueprint for governing the postwar
international monetary and financial order. The Allies agreed on a
system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates, laid the groundwork for
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and embraced an open
international economic system. The framework designed then largely
remains in place today.

Some of the most pressing technological issues facing the world's
democracies now may ultimately rival in importance the economic issues
considered by the Bretton Woods delegates. Just as in 1944, when the
United States and like-minded countries recognized that they could no
longer make economic policy in a vacuum, today they must recognize that
the time has passed when they can deal with the profound effects of
technology on their own. For too long, national approaches to
technological questions have been ad hoc, poorly coordinated, and left
to technology experts to sort out. But in today's competitive global
environment, technology is too important to be left to the
technologists.

Democratic freedoms are unquestionably under assault in many nations.
Autocrats are aggressive precisely because of the growing demands for

that middle classes in nations such as China and Russia will not be

The good news is that we have billions of allies around the world:
citizens on every continent chafing for greater freedom and dignity.
They do not want U.S. military-led nation-building.  They want peaceful
support for their independent efforts to create democratic space in
systems distorted by overweening government control, dangerous
governance gaps and foreign malign influence.

The free world cannot be neutral in the face of autocracy's resurgence.
Rather, it should play to its strengths. The [**appeal** of democratic
opportunity is a **strategic asset** for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates --- [**despite** our own
**shortcomings**]{.underline} --- because people around the world
similarly aspire to live in societies that guarantee justice, rights and
dignity.  

[America's]{.underline} closest [allies are democracies. [Democracies
**don't fight each other**]{.mark}, **export** violent **extremism**, or
**produce** the **conflicts** that drive mass migration.
[Democracies]{.mark}]{.underline} are better partners [in

ADDRESSING THE SKEPTICS

Objections to a T-12 are easy to imagine. The most obvious would be
general opposition to any new international grouping, which would join a
raft of existing multilateral organizations, some of which are obsolete.
Yet [[the T-12's **novelty**]{.mark} [is what makes it
relevant]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[There is no group of]{.mark}
**[advanced democracies]{.mark}** [to coordinate tech]{.mark}nology
policy]{.underline}: the G-7 leaves out important technology leaders,
and the G-20 includes the illiberal states of China, Russia, Saudi
Arabia, and Turkey. [[NATO is a **military** alliance focused]{.mark}
first and foremost [on]{.mark} **[European
security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark}
[Organization]{.mark}]{.underline} for Economic Cooperation and
Development, with 37 member states, [[is **too
large**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and lacks the track record to break ground
on technological issues]{.underline}. [[The T-12]{.underline}]{.mark},
by contrast, [[would bring together the **right
members**]{.underline}]{.mark} [while elevating technology to a level
commensurate with]{.underline} such issues as [European
security]{.underline} and global economic policy.

[The **private sector's** role in a]{.underline} potential
[T-12]{.underline} raises another question: Why would any business
participate in a government-driven process? The answer is that [it would
make **economic sense**]{.underline}. [Consider the **inevitable
restructuring**]{.underline} [and **geographic
diversification**]{.underline} [of supply chains that will almost
certainly follow the coronavirus pandem]{.underline}ic. Already,
governments and firms are considering reshoring pharmaceutical and

Beyond this, [the T-12's members could develop and adopt a

**perpetual threat** from **cyberattacks**, given the low barriers to
entry and the difficulty of attributing]{.underline} an attack to a

The T-12 could also develop the framework for a digital currency that
preserves the central role of the U.S. dollar in the global financial
system. That role is under threat. China's central bank is already
piloting a digital currency program. If the effort succeeds, China is
likely to extend its use to countries that participate in its Belt and
Road Initiative, expanding the renminbi's reach as an international
medium of exchange and possibly threatening the dollar's preeminent
status. Pursuing a secure digital dollar-based platform would level this
playing field, making it faster and easier to accomplish tasks such as
moving money between banks, trading oil futures, and tracking money
laundering.

assessments of the risks of China's 5G technology, examine advances in
quantum computing, investigate AI safety, and share strategies for
preventing the theft of intellectual property. In a more ambitious step,
they could exchange information about online propaganda, disinformation,
the integrity of academic research, and specific ways in which
autocratic regimes employ technology to erode liberal democracy.

**[[TIME FOR ACTION]{.underline}]{.mark}**

In July 1944, delegates of the Allied countries came together in New
Hampshire for what became known as the Bretton Woods conference. After
discussions of various technical issues and sweeping foreign policy
debates, the conference produced a blueprint for governing the postwar
international monetary and financial order. The Allies agreed on a
system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates, laid the groundwork for
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and embraced an open
international economic system. The framework designed then largely
remains in place today.

Some of the most pressing technological issues facing the world's
democracies now may ultimately rival in importance the economic issues
considered by the Bretton Woods delegates. Just as in 1944, when the
United States and like-minded countries recognized that they could no
longer make economic policy in a vacuum, today they must recognize that
[the **time has passed** when they can deal with the profound effects of
technology **on their own**]{.underline}. **[[For too
long]{.underline}]{.mark}**, national [[approaches to
tech]{.mark}nological [questions have been **ad
hoc**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[poorly
coordinated]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and left to]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nology **[experts]{.mark}** to sort out]{.underline}. But
in today's competitive global environment, [[tech]{.mark}nology [is
**too important** to be left to the
**technologists**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**Autocracies will win the tech race.**

Since then, [autocratic states have **caught up**]{.underline}. [China
is at the **forefront**]{.underline}, [no longer a mere rising power in
technology and now an **American peer**]{.underline}. [In multiple
areas]{.underline}---[including facial and voice recognition, 5G
technology, digital payments, quantum communications, and the commercial
drone market]{.underline}---[it has **surpassed** the United
States]{.underline}. [Leaders in **Cuba**, **Iran**, **No**rth
**Ko**rea, Russia, Venezuela, and elsewhere are increasingly using
technology for **illiberal ends**]{.underline}, following China's
example. And despite [the United States']{.underline} remaining
advantage in some technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and
semiconductor production, it [has fallen behind China in formulating an
**overall strategy**]{.underline} for their use.

Almost in parallel, [the United States and its allies]{.underline} have
stepped away from their tradition of collaboration. Instead of working
together on issues of common interest, they have been pulled apart by
diverging national interests and have responded incoherently to
autocratic states' co-optation of new technologies. Although officials
in most democratic capitals now acknowledge the profound ways in which
new technologies are shaping the world, they remain strangely
disconnected from one another when it comes to managing them.
[Coordination]{.underline}, when it occurs, [is **sporadic**,
**reactive**, and **ad hoc**]{.underline}.

[The liberal democracies are **running out of time**]{.underline} [to
get their act together]{.underline}: [whoever shapes the use of emerging
technologies such as AI, quantum computing, biotechnology, and
next-generation telecommunications will have an economic, military, and
political advantage for **decades to come**]{.underline}. But the
world's advanced democracies have something the autocracies don't: a
long history of multilateral cooperation for the benefit of all.

Because the issues are so diverse, [what's needed now is not more
**piecemeal solutions**]{.underline} [but an **overarching
forum**]{.underline} [in which **like-minded** countries]{.underline}
[can come together to hammer out **joint responses**]{.underline}. [This
new grouping of leading]{.underline}
"[techno-democracies]{.underline}"---[call it the T-12]{.underline},
given the logical list of members---[would help democracies **regain the
initiative**]{.underline} [in global technology
competition]{.underline}. [It would allow them to promote their
**preferred norms**]{.underline} [and **values**]{.underline} [around
the use of emerging technologies and preserve their **competitive
advantage**]{.underline} in key areas. Above all, [it would help
coordinate a **unified response** to a chief threat to the global
order]{.underline}.

**Autocracies are leading now.**

**[AUTOCRACIES IN THE LEAD]{.underline}**

[Washington has struggled to develop a **coherent vision**]{.underline}
[to guide its global technological role, but many autocracies have
not]{.underline}. [China]{.underline}, in particular, [has recognized
that the existing rules of the international order were largely written
in a predigital age and that it has an opportunity to **write fresh
ones**]{.underline}. Already, [Beijing is pursuing this goal by quickly
building **top-notch**]{.underline} [capabilities and deploying them
throughout the **global market**, especially in areas where the U.S.
presence is]{.underline} **[weak]{.underline}** [or **virtually
nonexistent**]{.underline}. [In **Zimbabwe**]{.underline}, for instance,
[the Chinese AI company]{.underline} CloudWalk [is helping develop a
national facial recognition system]{.underline}, giving the local
government a powerful new tool for political control.

But [forward-looking efforts such as these are not solely
unilateral]{.underline}. [**China**, **Russia**, and **other
autocracies** are already coordinating around a self-interested global
vision]{.underline}. [They are shaping standards for the use of new
technologies]{.underline} in exclusive groups such as the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization, whose members have agreed to collaborate on
information security, robotics, and e-commerce, among other areas. They
also work through global forums such as the International
Telecommunication Union, where some of the same countries have supported
international standards that facilitate unaccountable surveillance.
Unlike many liberal democracies, quite a few autocracies have realized
that technology, including the power to innovate, set norms for its use,
and shape the institutions that decide how it will be employed, is not
simply a niche functional issue buried in a crowded foreign policy
agenda; it is a central element of modern geopolitical competition.

[The United States]{.underline}, on the other hand, [has been mostly
**reactive**]{.underline}. [China's rapid progress in 5G, AI, and
quantum communications has stumped multiple U.S.
administrations]{.underline}. [Washington has no easy answer to
China's]{.underline} so-called Digital Silk Road, an array of
technological infrastructure projects to accompany the construction
projects of its Belt and Road Initiative, nor does it have an answer to
the country's campaign to establish a digital currency. The [United
States and its allies have consistently struggled to define the rules of
engagement around cyberattack]{.underline}s and have responded
inadequately to the use of technologies by autocracies to oppress their
people. U.S. officials often complain about Beijing's dominance in
technical standard setting and allies' deferential attitude toward
Chinese infrastructure. But they have had a difficult time changing the
nature of the game.

The T-12 would help democracies regain the initiative in global
technology competition.

[This is a **multinational failure**]{.underline}. [Liberal democracies
around the world simply do not work together on many of the issues that
should unite them]{.underline}. Their responses to autocracies' abuse of
technology tend to be fragmented. National interests diverge,
disagreements among states arise, and nothing gets done. Within
countries, paralysis often occurs as domestic authorities clash with
their national security counterparts over how to deal with election
meddling, disinformation, and hacking. Instead of pursuing broad
collaboration, the liberal democracies have come up with a patchwork of
discrete responses: Canada and France's collaboration on an expert panel
tasked with monitoring developments in AI policy, for example, or NATO's
pursuit of a cyber-deterrence doctrine.

The dispute over the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei's 5G
capabilities is perhaps the best example of democracies' inconsistent
response. Following Australia's initial lead, the United States took a
hard line against the company, banning Huawei components from its
national 5G network and forbidding U.S. entities from doing business of
any sort with it. The United States proceeded to insist that other
democracies follow suit, even threatening to withhold critical
intelligence from allies if they adopted Huawei products. Still,
[Washington remains **relatively isolated** in its
opposition]{.underline}. [Many governments continue to resist U.S.
pressure, pointing out that there is no low-cost, one-stop-shop
alternative to Huawei's technology]{.underline}. [Even **Canada** and
**South Korea**]{.underline}, [close U.S. allies, have **defied**
Washington and are considering Huawei equipment for their 5G
infrastructure]{.underline}.

[The democracies have come up with a **similarly
disjointed**]{.underline} [response to Russia's election
meddling]{.underline}. Although the Kremlin has interfered in the
elections of multiple countries, the problem has largely been treated as
a national one, deserving of only a unilateral response from any given
target. When Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,
only the United States responded with punitive measures. Likewise,
Russia's reported meddling in this year's U.S. presidential election has
so far not produced any unified reaction. Compare that to the response
to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its poisoning of a former
intelligence officer and his daughter in the United Kingdom. In those
cases, the major democracies coordinated a joint response, imposing new
sanctions and expelling Russian diplomats.

[The order will inevitably look]{.underline} somewhat
[different]{.underline} as the twenty-first century progresses. China,
India, and other economies will continue to grow, and the U.S. share of
the world economy will drop. [But [no]{.mark} other
[country]{.mark}]{.underline}, including China, [[is poised to displace
the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[from its dominant position]{.underline}. Even so, the order may still
be threatened by a general diffusion of power away from governments
toward nonstate actors. [[The info]{.mark}rmation [revolution is
putting]{.mark}]{.underline} a number of [transnational issues, such as
[**financial stability**, **climate change**, **terrorism**,
**pandemics**]{.mark}, and [**cybersecurity**, on the global
agenda]{.mark} at the same time]{.underline} as [it is weakening the
ability of all governments to respond]{.underline}.¶ [Complexity is
growing]{.underline}, and world politics will soon not be the sole
province of governments. Individuals and private organizations---from
corporations and nongovernmental organizations to terrorists and social
movements---are being empowered, and informal networks will undercut the
monopoly on power of traditional bureaucracies. Governments will
continue to possess power and resources, but the stage on which they
play will become ever more crowded, and they will have less ability to
direct the action.¶ Even if [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates remains the largest power,
accordingly, it [[will not]{.mark} be able to
[achieve]{.mark}]{.underline} many of its [international [goals]{.mark}
acting [alone]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [**international
[financial stability]{.mark}** is vital]{.underline} to the prosperity
of Americans, [but the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[[needs]{.mark} the [cooperation]{.mark} of others to ensure
it]{.underline}. Global **[[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
rising sea levels will affect the quality of life, but [Americans
[cannot manage]{.mark}]{.underline} these problems [[by
themselves]{.underline}]{.mark}. And in a world [where [borders
are]{.mark}]{.underline} becoming more porous, [[letting
in]{.underline}]{.mark} everything from [**[drugs]{.mark} to infectious
[diseases]{.mark} to [terrorism]{.mark}**[, nations
must]{.mark}]{.underline} use soft power to [develop networks and [build
institutions]{.mark} to address shared threats and
challenges]{.underline}.¶ China is unlikely to surpass the United States
in power anytime soon.¶ Washington can provide some important global
public goods largely by itself. The U.S. Navy is crucial when it comes
to policing the law of the seas and defending freedom of navigation, and
the U.S. Federal Reserve undergirds international financial stability by
serving as a lender of last resort. On the new transnational issues,
however, success will require the cooperation of others---and thus
empowering others can help the United States accomplish its own goals.
In this sense, power becomes a positive-sum game: one needs to think of
not just the United States' power over others but also the power to
solve problems that the United States can acquire by working with
others. In such a world, the ability to connect with others becomes a
major source of power, and here, too, the United States leads the pack.
The United States comes first in the Lowy Institute's ranking of nations
by number of embassies, consulates, and missions. It has some 60 treaty
allies, and The Economist estimates that nearly 100 of the 150 largest
countries lean toward it, while only 21 lean against it.¶ [Increasingly,
however]{.underline}, the [[openness that enables the

The Rise of a Global Society

Let me first sketch the global democratic project for global governance
as a point of reference. We must first recognize that globalization has
given rise to a global society [for the **first time** in]{.underline}
the [evolution of the]{.underline} human [**species**. We
are]{.underline} now [**stuck with each other**; **[seven and half
billion]{.mark}** people today ---]{.underline} nine to [[**ten**
by]{.mark} **20[50]{.mark}**:]{.underline} all [**super connected** and
**interdependent**. In greater or lesser measure, humans [are]{.mark}
mutually [dependent]{.mark}]{.underline} on each other in the pursuit of
their most salient values, interests, needs, and preferences ---
[[concerns]{.underline} [about]{.underline}]{.mark} personal, community,
and national **[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[sustainable]{.underline} economic **[[growth]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
protection of [the **[environment]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the [equitable
**[distribution]{.mark}** of]{.underline} the globe's material [wealth,
human **[rights]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} even the [validation
of]{.underline} their personal and social [identities]{.underline} by
others. Global [[**warming** is a metaphor]{.mark} of this morphological
social change]{.underline} in the human condition. [**[All]{.mark}**
humans [are **implicated** in]{.mark} this looming]{.underline}
Anthropogenic-induced **[[disaster]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- the
exhausts of billions of automobiles, the methane released in fracking
for natural gas, outdated U.S. coal-fired power plants and newly
constructed ones in China. Even the poor farmer burning charcoal to warm
his dinner is complicit.

Since interdependence surrounds, ensnares, and binds us as a human
society, the dilemma confronting the world's diverse and divided
populations is evident: the expanding scope as well as the deepening,
accumulating, and thickening interdependencies of globalization urge
global government. But the Kantian ideal of universal governance is
beyond the reach of the world's disparate peoples. They are profoundly
divided by religion, culture, language, tribal, ethnic and national
loyalties as well as by class, social status, race, gender, and sexual
orientation. How have the democracies responded to this dilemma? How
have they attempted to reconcile the growing interdependence of the
world's disputing peoples and need for global governance?

What do we mean by the governance of a human society?

A working, legitimate government of a human society requires
simultaneous responses to three competing imperatives: Order, Welfare,
and Legitimacy. While the forms of these OWL imperatives have differed
radically over the course of human societal evolution, these constraints
remain predicable of all human societies if they are to replicate
themselves and flourish over time. The OWL imperatives are no less
applicable to a global society.

1\. Order refers to a society's investment of awesome material power in
an individual or body to arbitrate and resolve value, interest, and
preference conflicts, which cannot be otherwise resolved by non-violent
means --- the Hobbesian problematic.

2\. The Welfare imperative refers to the necessity of humans to eat,
drink, clothe, and shelter themselves and to pursue the full-range of
their seemingly limitless acquisitive appetites. Responses to the
Welfare imperative, like that of Order, constitute a distinct form of
governing power and authority with its own decisional processes and
actors principally associated either with the Welfare or the Order
imperative. Hence we have the Marxian-Adam Smith problematic.

3\. Legitimacy is no less a form of governing power and authority,
independent of the Order and Welfare imperatives. Either by choice,
socialization, or coerced acquiescence, populations acknowledge a
regime's governing authority and their obligation to submit to its rule.
Here arises the Rousseaunian problematic.

The government of a human society emerges then as an evolving,
precarious balance and compromise of the ceaseless struggle of these
competing OWL power domains for ascendancy of one of these imperatives
over the others. It is against the backdrop of these OWL imperatives ---
Order, Welfare, and Legitimacy --- that we are brought to the democratic
project for global governance.

The Democratic Project

For Order, open societies constructed the global democratic state and,
in alliance, the democratic global-state system. Collectively these
initiatives led to the creation of the United Nations, the World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, and the
European Union to implement the democratic project's system of global
governance.

The democratic global state assumed all of the functions of the
Hobbesian Westphalian security state --- but a lot more. The global
state became a Trading, Banking, Market, and Entrepreneurial state. To
these functions were added those of the Science, Technology and the
Economic Growth state. How else would we be able to enjoy the Internet,
cell phones and iPhones, or miracle cures? These are the products of the
iron triangle of the global democratic state, academic and non-profit
research centers, and corporations. It is a myth that the Market System
did all this alone. Fueled by increasing material wealth, the democratic
global state was afforded the means to become the Safety Net state,
providing education, health, social security, leisure and recreation for
its population. And as the global state's power expanded across this
broad and enlarging spectrum of functions and roles, the global state
was also constrained by the social compacts of the democracies to be
bound by popular rule. The ironic result of the expansion of the global
state's power and social functions and its obligation to accede to
popular will was a Security state and global state-system that vastly
outperformed its principal authoritarian rivals in the Cold War. So much
briefly is the democratic project's response to the Order imperative.

Now let's look at the democratic project's response to the Welfare
imperative. The democracies institutionalized Adam Smith's vision of a
global Market System. The Market System trucks and barters, Smith's
understanding of what it means to be human. But it does a lot more. The
Market System facilitates and fosters the free movement of people, goods
and services, capital, ideas, values, scientific discoveries, and best
technological practices. Created is a vibrant global civil society
oblivious to state boundaries. What we now experience is De
Tocqueville's Democracy in America on global steroids.

As for the imperative of Legitimacy, the social compacts of the
democracies affirmed Rousseau's conjecture that all humans are free and
therefore equal. Applied to elections each citizen has one vote.
[Democratic [regimes]{.mark}]{.underline} are also obliged to submit to
the rule of law, to conduct free and fair elections, to honor majority
rule while protecting minority rights, and to [**[promote]{.mark}**
human [rights]{.mark}]{.underline} at home and
[**[abroad]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The Authoritarian Threat to the Democratic Project

[The **democratic project** for **global [governance]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark} now [at **risk**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Let's start with the
challenges posed by authoritarian regimes, with Russia and China in the
lead. Both [[Russia and China would **rest global governance**]{.mark}
on Big Power spheres of influence. Both]{.underline} would
[[assume]{.underline} **[hegemonic status]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in
their]{.underline} respective [regions, [asserting]{.mark}
their]{.underline} [versions of the **Monroe Doctrine**.]{.underline}
Their [[regional hegemony]{.mark} would]{.underline} then
**[leverage]{.underline}** [their claim to be global **Big
Powers**.]{.underline} Moscow and Beijing would then have an equal say
with the United States and the West in sharing and shaping global
governance. [[The]{.mark} Russo-Chinese global
[system]{.mark}]{.underline} of Order [[would
ascribe]{.underline}]{.mark} to Russia and China governing privileges
not accorded to the states both aspire to dominate. [Moscow and
Beijing]{.underline} would enjoy [**unconditional** recognition
of]{.underline} their state **[sovereignty]{.underline}**, territorial
integrity, and non-interference in their domestic affairs,
[but]{.underline} [they would]{.underline} reserve to themselves the
right to [**intervene** in]{.underline} the domestic and foreign affairs
of the [states]{.underline} and peoples under their tutelage [in pursuit
of]{.underline} their [hegemonic interests.]{.underline} President
[Putin]{.underline} has [announced]{.underline} that [Russia's
**imperialism** encompasses]{.underline} the **[millions]{.underline}**
of Russians [living in the]{.underline} [former]{.underline} republics
of the [Soviet Union.]{.underline} Russia contends that Ukraine and
Belarus also fall under Moscow's purported claim to historical
sovereignty over these states. [Forceful re-absorption of **Crimea** and
control over eastern **Ukraine**]{.underline} [are viewed
by]{.underline} President [Putin as Russia's historical
inheritances.]{.underline} Self-determination is not extended to these
states or to other states and peoples of the former Soviet Union. Moscow
rejects their right to freely align, say, with the European Union or,
god forbid, with NATO.

In contrast to the democratic project, universal in its reach, [the
[Russo-Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline} conception of a stable [global
[order rests on]{.mark}]{.underline} more
**[[tenuous]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [[**conflict-prone**
**ethno-national foundations**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Russia's proclaimed
enemies are the United States and the European Union. Any means that
undermines the unity of these entities is viewed by Moscow as a gain.
[[The endgame]{.mark} is [a **poly-anarchical**]{.mark} interstate
system,]{.underline} potentially [[as **war-prone** as]{.mark} the
Eurocentric system **[before]{.mark}** and **after [World War
I]{.mark}**[, but]{.mark}]{.underline} now [populated by states [with
**nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Then there is the likely reaction of China and Russia. Wouldn't a new
group of techno-democracies merely provoke them? Indeed, they probably
would treat it as a threat, but [[the cost of forgoing
coop]{.mark}eration [among]{.mark} liberal [democracies is **far
higher**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[than the consequences of]{.mark} **any
[pushback]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As the COVID-19 pandemic has proved,
[[when liberal democracies fail to **work
together**]{.underline}]{.mark}, whether, in this case, in harmonizing
travel restrictions, employing disease-mitigation measures, or assisting
poorer nations, **[[China benefits]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The T-12
should not ignore [[illiberal states]{.underline}]{.mark}, and it can
try to work with them on issues such as AI safety or technological
responses to climate change. [But [it should **tread
