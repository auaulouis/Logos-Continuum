#### Psychoanalysis fails -- "successes" had other medical explanations and the theory is too entrenched in tragedy to make any real progress

In 1881, a young woman in Vienna discovered she had lost her native
German tongue. She could speak nothing but English. Bertha Pappenheim
was diagnosed by her doctor with hysteria. The symptoms included
contractures, hallucinations, and aphasia ― the loss of basic functions
such as language. They were resistant to conventional treatment; and so
Pappenheim became the first ever patient of psychoanalysis. Her name, in
one of the practice's foundational texts, Studies on Hysteria, is Anna
O.

The original patient of psychoanalysis was never treated by the father
of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud; she was treated instead by its John
the Baptist, Josef Breuer, who co-wrote Studies on Hysteria. "The
discovery of Breuer's," wrote Freud of his colleague in 1917, "is still
the foundation of psycho-analytical theory". What Breuer discovered, and
Freud later developed, was that neurotic conditions could be treated by
a "talking cure". By talking about her childhood experiences to the
analyst, the patient can relieve herself of the disorders that burden
her --- and subsequently alleviate, with the help of the analyst, the
physical manifestations of such disorders.

Psychoanalysis, then, is medical treatment by language. Adam Phillips,
one of the leading psychoanalysts in England, writes that "Freud was as
much, if not more, of writer than a doctor". Like
the Fin-de-Siècle writers who uncovered the dark undercurrents of
bourgeois conventions, or the modernist writers who questioned coherent
narratives, Freud was an integral part of the lively intellectual
culture that witnessed the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and
much of continental Europe. And it was very much a literary culture.

To briefly psychoanalyse: as a child Freud was gifted at languages,
became familiar with Greek, Latin, Spanish, Italian, French and English.
And yet it was medicine he ultimately studied at the University of
Vienna: as the firstborn son, he wanted to be dutiful and serve his
impoverished family.

All of which begs the question that haunts his legacy[: did his
treatment work?]{.underline}

Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen, in [Freud's Patients: A Book of
Lives](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/F/bo130702831.html) (out
last month), thinks not. ["Freud's cures were largely ineffectual," he
writes, "when they were not downright destructive"]{.underline}.
Borch-Jacobsen examines 38 patients Freud treated in his 50-year
practice, but his book is concerned less with the efficacy of
psychoanalysis and more with portraying, in selective but vivid detail,
the individuals Freud treated. "We all know the characters described by
Freud in his case studies," he writes, "but do we know these illustrious
pseudonyms?" His book is "an attempt to reconstruct the sometimes
comical, most often tragic and always captivating stories of these
patients who have long been nameless and faceless".

Anna Von Lieben, referred to as Cäcilie M by Freud, was his most
important patient for a period of six years, beginning in 1887. She was,
Borch-Jacobsen writes, part of the "Viennese Jewish upper bourgeoisie":
brought up in a palace, where her family hosted Brahms, Strauss and
Liszt. She was treated in Paris by Freud's hero, Jean-Martin Charcot,
otherwise known as the Napoleon of Neuroses. In Vienna, she was also a
patient of Breuer.

Von Lieben was obese. She tried to curb this by following a strict diet
of caviar and champagne. And she was an accomplished chess player: she
liked to play two games simultaneously, and, while she slept, she would
have a chess player on standby near her room in case she woke up and
fancied a game. Perhaps not unrelatedly, Von Lieben had facial neuralgia
and attacks of the nerves. For this, Freud was brought in to treat her.

He was her "nerve doctor". He used hypnosis to purge her of childhood
traumas. [Unlike the talking cure Breuer used on Pappenheim, however ---
in which the patient simply remembers her traumatic experiences --- in
Freud's talking cure the patient is invited "to relive and forget their
traumas". But he also gave her morphine --- and this was what stopped
her neurotic attacks, not hypnosis. "The famous cathartic cure of
Cäcilie M", writes Borsch-Jacobsen, "was in fact a morphine
cure".]{.underline}

[Her husband, Leopold von Lieben, "finally decided to end her treatment
with Freud, which had spanned almost six years and had produced no
lasting improvement". Anna von Lieben died of a cardiac arrest when she
was 53. Her children referred to Freud as der Zauberer --- the magician
--- who performed worthless tricks on their mother.]{.underline}

Cäcilie M is not the only woman in Borch-Jacobsen's book who could
afford champagne and caviar. Three quarters of Freud's patients were
rich. Fanny Moser, referred to in Studies on Hysteria as Emmy von N, was
"said to be the richest woman in Central Europe". When she was 23, she
married a 63-year-old Swiss businessman named Heinrich Moser, who had
amassed his wealth by selling watches in Russia and Asia; three years
later, Heinrich died and left most of his fortune to his wife.

Freud's patients were not only rich; they were fashionable. [In late
nineteenth century German-speaking Europe, psychoanalysis became à la
mode. It didn't work as an effective medical treatment for neurotic
ailments.]{.underline} Psychoanalysis was embraced, consistent with
Veblen's contemporaneous model of ["conspicuous
consumption"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorstein_Veblen#Conspicuous_consumption),
as a way for the bourgeoisie to signal their affinity with cutting-edge
theories and practices. They were seduced by the ideas of psychoanalysis
rather than by the outcomes of it; it was evidence that they were
citizens of a modern civilisation.

And Freud also saw himself as modern: he was a figure of the
Enlightenment, who defined himself against the reactionary force of
religion. He skipped his mother's Jewish funeral. He didn't have his
sons circumcised. And his children were forbidden to enter a synagogue
while they were living with him. In one of his last books, Moses and
Monotheism, he argued that Moses was Egyptian rather than Jewish. In
1937, when Freud was visited by the French psychoanalyst René Laforgue,
he was asked whether he feared the Nazis. Freud said: "The Nazis? I'm
not afraid of them. Help me rather to combat my true enemy". When
Laforgue asked who this was, Freud replied: "Religion, the Roman
Catholic Church".

He was, though, operating within a tradition. Religion sustained attacks
throughout the nineteenth century in the German-speaking world, by
thinkers of the [Higher
Criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_criticism) movement,
which sought to demystify documents that were considered sacred ― to
look at the unvarnished world behind the text. Freud had a similarly
iconoclastic vision: to look beneath the surface of our selves. Like two
other successors of the Higher Criticism tradition, Karl Marx and
Friedrich Nietzsche, he recognised that religion satisfied a deep human
craving, but denied the sanctity of religious doctrine.

It is perhaps ironic, then, that Freud is often treated as a messiah.
Frederick Crews, in his extensive and pugnacious biography of him,
opened with this sentence: "Among historical figures, Sigmund Freud
ranks with Shakespeare and Jesus of Nazareth for the amount of attention
bestowed upon him by scholars and commentators". [We find him engrossing
because he presented his beliefs as universal truths ― but also because
these truths tease rather than satisfy us. They draw us in like a great
novel or a play in that they don't offer a definitive sort of closure,
but something to dwell on. Freud was closer to a literary messiah like
Shakespeare than a religious messiah like Jesus; embracing him will not
make us see the light.]{.underline}

[In fact, his theories made us more mysterious to ourselves. As Phillips
puts it, it was "knowledge that he wanted, but not necessarily clarity".
The paradox at the heart of psychoanalysis is that it is an attempt to
shed light on something it views as irreducibly opaque: the self. Kant,
the father of the German Enlightenment, said know thyself. Freud said
sure ― but it won't be enlightening.]{.underline}

[And if we can't clearly know ourselves, how can we expect to know
others? How, for example, can an analyst know his patient and vice
versa? Janet Malcolm, in "The Impossible Profession", her essay on
psychoanalysis, posits that "the concept of transference", which is key
to psychoanalysis,]{.underline}

["at once destroys faith in personal relations and explains why they are
tragic: We cannot know each other. We must grope around for each other
through a dense thicket of absent others. We cannot see each other
plain".]{.underline}

[Psychoanalysis, as Malcolm suggests, constitutes a fundamentally tragic
way of seeing life: as an unending struggle to know other people. One of
Freud's most famous theories, after all, was based on a classical Greek
tragedy in which a man doesn't know his own mother when he sees
her.]{.underline}

[But if we accept the premise of psychoanalysis --- that life is
inevitably tragic --- then treatment, which psychoanalysis also claims
to offer, seems elusive. If life is an unending struggle, the notion of
being fixed is futile. This is another way in which psychoanalysis,
despite Freud's self-image, doesn't fit with the model of enlightenment,
in which our bodies and minds can be continuously improved, but rather
starts with the same premise as religion or literature or myth: that
human suffering is inescapable.]{.underline}

[The psychoanalysis of patient zero, Bertha Pappenheim, was
disastrous]{.underline}. "The treatment," writes Borch-Jacobsen, "[had
never shown any real progress and as early as the autumn of 1881 Breuer
was thinking of placing Bertha in another clinic."]{.underline} She
ended up spending four months in the Bellevue Sanitorium in Switzerland,
addicted to morphine because of Breuer's attempt to alleviate her facial
neuralgia.

Later in life, she had a successful career: she translated Mary
Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Women into German and,
in 1904, founded the League of Jewish Women, which became the largest
Jewish women's organisation in Germany. In 1907, she also funded a home
for unwed mothers and "illegitimate" children in Neu-Isenberg. A friend
named Dora Edinger says Pappenheim "violently opposed any suggestion of
psychoanalytic therapy for someone she was in charge of". She utterly
rejected the practice. In 1954, a year after Ernest Jones revealed Anna
O was Pappenheim, in the first volume of his biography of Freud, a
German postage stamp was issued. The left side read: "Bertha
Pappenheim". The right side read: "Helfer der Menschheit," helper of
mankind.

[Freud was not a helper of mankind. He was too transfixed by tragedy. He
ultimately did not want to improve us in any direct way; he wanted only
to refract our disjointed selves back to us, like the analyst with the
patient, or the novelist with the reader.]{.underline}

### Different types

#### Making a generalized statement about whether psychoanalysis fails or succeeds fails - different ways to psychoanalyze

[There are at least two ways that Freudian psychoanalysis can be used as
a method to analyze texts.]{.underline}

[• The first approach is author-centered, treating the text as the
equivalent to an author's dream]{.underline}. Freud, Masson, & Fliess
(1985) [identify what they call 'the class of dreams that have never
been dreamt at all -- dreams created by imaginative writers and ascribed
to invented characters in the course of a story']{.underline}. The
surface of a text (words and images, etc.) are regarded as the manifest
content, while [the latent content is the author's hidden desires. Texts
are read in this way to discover an author's fantasies; these are seen
as the real meaning of the text.]{.underline}

[• The second approach is reader-centered, and derives from the
secondary aspect of the author-centered approach. This approach is
concerned with how texts allow readers to symbolically play out desires
and fantasies in the texts they read. In this way, a text works like a
substitute dream.]{.underline}

Freud deploys the idea of 'fore-pleasure' to explain the way in which
the pleasures of the text 'make possible the release of still greater
pleasure arising from deeper psychical sources'. [In other words,
fictional texts stage fantasies that offer the possibility of
unconscious pleasure and satisfaction.]{.underline} As he further
explains,

> "In my opinion, all the aesthetic pleasure which a creative writer
> affords us has the character of a fore-pleasure our actual enjoyment
> of an imaginative work proceeds from a liberation of tensions in our
> minds enabling us thenceforward to enjoy our day-dreams without
> self-reproach or shame."

In other words, although we may derive pleasure from the aesthetic
qualities of a text, [these are really only the mechanism that allows us
access to the more profound pleasures of unconscious
fantasy.]{.underline} Freud's translation of psychoanalysis to textual
analysis begins with a somewhat crude version of psychobiography and
ends with a rather sophisticated account of how meanings are made.
However, his suggestions about the real pleasures of reading may have a
certain disabling effect on psychoanalytic criticism.
