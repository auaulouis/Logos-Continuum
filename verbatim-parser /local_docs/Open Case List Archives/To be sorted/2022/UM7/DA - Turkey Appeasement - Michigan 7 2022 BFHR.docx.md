#### US-Turkey defense cooperation is [low now]{.underline}. The continuity of the alliance is at a [crossroads]{.underline}.

After decades of speculation about the future of the U.S.-Turkish
alliance, [Washington and Ankara have finally reached a **fork in the
road**]{.underline}. The day after Turkish President Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan announced plans to deepen defense cooperation with Russia, his
government formally submitted a request to the United States for 40 new
Block 70 model F-16 aircraft and upgrade kits for 80 F-16s already in
service with the Turkish Air Force. The U.S. Congress may well block the
sale. And even if it goes through, Erdoğan may well decide to buy more
Russian weapons anyways. This impasse was the inevitable result of
Ankara's 2017 decision to purchase the Russian S-400 air defense system
and Washington's subsequent decision to impose sanctions and remove
Turkey from the F-35 fighter program. As a result, the Turkish Air Force
faces a serious issue in the near future. Ankara remains steadfast in
its commitment to deploy the S-400, a system that Washington and major
NATO allies have deemed a threat to Western tactical aviation. Absent a
compromise on the deployment and location of the S-400, Ankara could be
left without a fighter to replace aging F-16s. Turkey has made clear
that it intends to develop its own fighter, dubbed TF/X, but the project
is marred by issues with engine procurement and, at best, will not be
produced at scale until the mid-2030s. In the meantime, [the Turkish
government has sought to leverage its ties with Russia to coerce
Washington into making concessions]{.underline} on the F-16 sale. In
late September, following his visit to New York for the United Nations
General Assembly, Erdoğan expressed his irritation with U.S. President
Joe Biden. He accused Washington of supporting terrorists in Syria, and
suggested that the United States could not be trusted to provide the
equipment to upgrade and sustain Turkish F-16s. As part of this effort,
Erdoğan then travelled to Sochi, Russia in late September, where he met
with Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was after this meeting that he
announced the two countries could deepen defense cooperation to include
work on fighter engines, submarines, and rocket motors. Erdoğan has also
signaled that Ankara may, in fact, push ahead and import a second S-400
regiment from Russia. The United States has an interest in selling
Turkey these F-16s. The Turkish government is a member of NATO and
ancillary tensions over Syria should not negatively impact the sale of
fourth-generation aircraft. But [with trust so badly
broken]{.underline}, it [is unwise for Ankara to assume that U.S.
policymakers will sign off on]{.underline} the [export]{.underline}
[over concerns about "losing Turkey."]{.underline} [Playing the Russia
card may not have its intended effect]{.underline}. The reality is that
whatever Washington does, [the United States and Turkey are **rapidly
reaching the last stage** in their **defense industrial
decoupling**]{.underline}. Legacy [cooperation is now
ending]{.underline} in favor of an autarkic Turkish effort to develop
indigenous systems and find non-U.S. suppliers.

#### Enhanced security cooperation triggers Turkish aggression

[[Turkey]{.mark}, despite having the second-largest standing military
force in NATO, [is inching toward a point where it becomes a possible
liability, instead of an asset]{.mark}]{.underline}. While not
discounting the points of tension in Syria and Libya, the most glaring
flashpoint for possible conflict is Turkey\'s enduring commitment to the
defense of Azerbaijan against Armenia, through training Azerbaijani
officers and supplying military equipment. Should a conflict erupt once
more, it would be between Turkish-backed Azerbaijan and Russian-backed
Armenia, presenting the potential for Turkey to, once again, be at odds
with the Russian military and call for NATO aid or assistance. Even
among NATO allies themselves, **[[Turkey has fanned the flames of
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with [Erdogan]{.underline} [becoming
more and more aggressive [in the Mediterranean]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
2020, Turkey disregarded a U.N.-enforced arms embargo around Libya and
responded with hostility when confronted by French patrols.
**[[Greco-Turkish tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Aegean [[almost
erupted into war]{.underline}]{.mark} in the same year after Greek and
Turkish frigates nearly collided over drilling disputes, forcing the
U.S. to step in and push for de-escalation and negotiations.
Nevertheless, [[among these hostilities, Turkey has been left
**relatively unscathed** by its NATO allies]{.underline}]{.mark}. As
Turkey continues to stoke the fires of ongoing tensions, the U.S. must
make clear that it will not fight Erdogan\'s wars under the obligation
of NATO defense if these disputes erupt beyond Erdogan\'s control.
**[[Continued concessions and aid]{.underline}]{.mark}** to U.S.
partners, **[[for simply being allies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[are
why]{.mark}]{.underline}** American **[[allies like
Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}** have **[[abuse]{.underline}]{.mark}**d and
taken advantage of these **[[leniencies and
stray]{.underline}]{.mark}**ed **[[away from American
interests]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Alliances are not meant to be
treated as sacred bonds of a covenant]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They are
formed to recognize parallel interests and commit to jointly serving
those interests. NATO was formed to support European nations who wanted
to counter the influence and might of Moscow and provide a unified
defense against the now dissolved Soviet Union. [[If]{.mark} these same
[NATO allies are]{.mark} now [flirting with Putin]{.mark}
unapologetically,]{.underline} [[the U.S. should]{.mark} **[adjust the
extent of its obligation]{.mark}** [to those whose interests lie
**opposite of American interests**. The U.S. should **rethink its
responsibility** of]{.mark} perpetual [European defense and **stop
serving allies like Turkey** their cake on a platter so that they can
both **have it and eat it too**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Specifically\-\--that causes escalatory conflict in [Syria]{.underline}. An [explicit call-out]{.underline} reverses aggression.

What\'s more, [Turkish belligerence]{.underline} in Syria is [revealing
the **cracks** within the NATO alliance]{.underline}. America\'s
European NATO allies are also relying on Turkey to control the flow of
migrants from Syria into Europe---and Turkey\'s willingness to use this
as a bargaining chip has given Turkey leverage over its European
neighbors.

[Going forward America needs to **tread carefully**, lest an alliance
with Turkey drags the US into a **wider conflict** we have absolutely
**no interest in**]{.underline}.

[First off,]{.underline} the US State Department\'s [**unequivocal
support** for Turkey]{.underline}\'s actions [is likely to **embolden
Ankara**]{.underline}, as it stumbles into disaster **[in
Syria]{.underline}**. [An emboldened Turkey **increases** the **risk**
that **Turkey** and **Russia** stumble toward **open conflict**. Again,
because Turkey is a NATO member, America has an **Article 5 commitment**
to come to Turkey\'s defense if it is attacked.]{.underline}

By the way, Turkey already carries much responsibility for---from the
get-go---funding the jihadist elements who fought in the bloody civil
war. The Assad regime is brutal and has committed a host of human rights
violations, but so have many of the jihadists Turkey has funded and
armed.

Because of this, from an anti-terror perspective, Turkey is not the good
guy in this fight. Areas outside the control of the Assad regime in
Damascus are more hospitable to anti-US terrorists---including both ISIS
and al-Qaeda. The fact that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was hiding
out in one of these ungoverned spaces near Idlib is a stark reminder of
this fact.

[Turkey is **neither** a good friend nor an enemy, but]{.underline}
right now America is committed [to **voice support** for
Turkey]{.underline}. That[**\'s** a **mistake**. The truth is that
**NATO membership** shouldn\'t be a **one-way street**, and
collective-defense alliances with **belligerent countries** like Turkey
are **extremely far** from **cost-free**. Cheerleading
Turkey]{.underline}\'s footprint in Syria [is the **last thing** the
US]{.underline} State Department [should be doing,]{.underline} as such
a situation is directly opposed to US interests in the region.

Finally, [an emboldened Turkey]{.underline}, less restrained in its
attempt to depose Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, [will also
**exacerbate** the ongoing **humanitarian catastrophe in Syria**. Right
now, Turkey is prolonging the civil war in Syria.]{.underline}

[This undermines both American **humanitarian** and **counterterrorism**
aims]{.underline}, because the longer the war goes on the more violence
and suffering ensues. Instead of applauding Turkey\'s actions in Syria,
because Turkey seeks to take out Assad, the **[US foreign policy
establishment should be calling Turkey out]{.underline}** for
destabilizing the region further.

As President Erdoğan mulls military intervention in Rojava, the Biden
Administration is facing the fact that [[a **NATO
country**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[could be the **aggressor**]{.mark} [in
the]{.mark} world's **[next major war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The United States is preparing for the possibility that
[[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}, a NATO member, [[may invade]{.mark}
**Rojava**]{.underline}, [an autonomous region in **northeastern
[Syria]{.mark}**]{.underline} [where both **U.S.** and **Russian**
soldiers]{.underline} [are currently stationed]{.underline}.

With Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan making increasingly ominous
threats to launch a military intervention in Rojava, officials from the
Biden Administration have been working to address these threats, aware
that a NATO country could be the aggressor in the world's next major
war.

"Basically, [Turkey wants to]{.underline} do the same thing that Russia
is doing in Ukraine, which is to [come in and **commit war crimes**
against the citizens]{.underline} here," said Nadine Maenza, the former
chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, when
she visited Rojava late last month. "I do hope the international
community and the United States stand up."

For several years, Turkey has been trying to destroy Rojava, a
Kurdish-led enclave. The Turkish government wants to eliminate the
region's revolutionary Syrian Kurds, who have created an autonomous
region inside Syria while providing a model of self-government for
Turkey's minority Kurdish population.

Erdoğan portrays Rojava's Kurdish militants as terrorists. He accuses
them of being part of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, a revolutionary
movement that has been seeking Kurdish liberation in Turkey.

Turkey has already, in recent years, launched several incursions into
Rojava. Its last major intervention, conducted in October 2019 with the
support of the Trump Administration, devastated the area, leaving Turkey
in control of a large swathe of territory.

[Ceasefire agreements have created a **highly complex** environment,
with security [forces from **several countries**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[station]{.mark}ed [in Rojava]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Both Russia and
the United States conduct military patrols, sometimes coming into
**conflict**]{.underline} [with one another]{.underline}.

Despite the Trump Administration's backing of Turkey's 2019 invasion,
the United States has maintained a close partnership with Rojava's
Kurdish militants. Since the Syrian Civil War, the U.S. military has
worked closely with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in
combating the Islamic State, and U.S. officials have repeatedly praised
them for their bravery.

As a presidential candidate, Joe [Biden described the Kurdish-led forces
as]{.underline} "**[courageous]{.underline}**" [and indicated that he
would continue to **support** them]{.underline}.

The Syrian Kurds have created a revolutionary new society on a model
that they call "democratic confederalism." Since the early years of the
Syrian Civil War, they have been building a confederated and autonomous
region in northeastern Syria that is democratic, pluralist, feminist,
and multi-ethnic.

"Progressives should support their effort to build a secure base for
direct democracy, feminism, and pluralism," Meredith Tax wrote earlier
this year in The Nation.

Though many U.S. officials oppose the Syrian Kurds' revolutionary
project, sometimes even working against it, others have praised them for
their achievements. At a hearing last month by the U.S. Commission on
International Religious Freedom, several participants commended Rojava
for its religious freedom and ethnic diversity, conditions that are
unique to north and east Syria. And for the second year in a row, the
commission called on the U.S. government to grant political recognition
to Rojava.

"They've built a government where they have these remarkable conditions
of acceptance and tolerance that really the rest of the world can learn
from," Maenza said during her visit to Rojava in May.

Turkey's recent threats follow moves by Finland and Sweden to join NATO.
Since Finland and Sweden have been sympathetic to the Syrian Kurds, with
Sweden providing Rojava with financial and political support, Turkey has
opposed NATO membership for the two countries.

Some analysts believe that Erdoğan is hoping the West will ignore
another Turkish-led military intervention in exchange for Turkey's
support for Finland and Sweden to join NATO.

So far, the Biden Administration has moved slowly to address Turkey's
provocations. Though several high-level officials have stated their
opposition to another Turkish military intervention, they have
acknowledged that they are looking for ways to accommodate Turkey.

"Concerns that Turkey has raised directly with Finland and Sweden are
being addressed by the Finns and the Swedes with the assistance of
NATO," said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a press briefing
last week. "We want to make sure that all allies have their security
concerns taken into account, and that, of course, includes Turkey."

For now, the main factor that could prevent the Biden Administration
from siding against the Syrian Kurds is Rojava's strategic importance in
the Syrian Civil War. With the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces
still controlling most of northeastern Syria, they have prevented Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad from regaining control of an important region
where oil reserves and wheat fields are located.

"That's a point of leverage because the Syrian government would love to
have dominion over those resources," Blinken said in 2020, referring to
the region's oil. "We should not give that up for free."

As Turkey continues to threaten Rojava, **[[the situation is growing
increasingly precarious]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with recent reports
indicating that Turkey has already begun conducting military operations.
[[Any]{.mark} [**major** Turkish]{.mark}-led military [incursion]{.mark}
[could spark a **broader conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which would
be **especially dangerous**]{.underline} [[with U.S. and Russia]{.mark}n
forces]{.underline} continuing to operate in the area.

"A potential war will not be an easy one," warned Mazloum Abdi, the
leader of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, in a recent
interview. "It will not end in a short period of time---unlike Turkey's
expectations. It will be a hard war and will last for a long time."

### U\-\--Coop Low

#### US-Turkey cooperation is [zeroed]{.underline} now. Prefer evidence [after]{.underline} Turkey's support for Russia vs Ukraine

**Gaber 6-22**-2022, nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council
IN TURKEY and at the Center in Modern Turkish Studies (Yevgeniya,
"**[Turkey's]{.underline}** wartime **[bridge to the West is
collapsing]{.underline}**,"
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/turkeysource/turkeys-wartime-bridge-to-the-west-is-collapsing/>)

Russia's unprovoked war of aggression in Ukraine has forced countries
around the world to reexamine their geopolitical choices.
**[Turkey]{.underline}**, a strategic partner to both of the states at
war, has been affected more than most nations. [Caught in a lose-lose
situation where taking any side in the conflict would lead to a major
rupture with the other partner, it has tried to maintain amicable
relations with both Russia and Ukra]{.underline}ine. At the same time,
the war has given Turkish leadership a chance to turn the challenges of
this shaky equilibrium into an opportunity by positioning Ankara as a
potential mediator between Moscow and Kyiv. While brokering a quick
peace or even a ceasefire in this war is highly unlikely in the short
term, [Turkey]{.underline} nonetheless [had a unique opportunity to mend
its shattered relations with the West]{.underline}.
**[However]{.underline}**, [nearly four months into the war, hopes for
such a rapprochement are starting to fade]{.underline}, [as Turkey's
balancing act gives way to a **tilt toward Moscow**]{.underline}. If
Turkey wants to use the crisis to build bridges with the West, its time
is running out. Promising start Prior to Russia's invasion, Turkey and
Ukraine had begun to develop a defense industry partnership that served
as a security boost for both nations. It also drew praise for anchoring
Turkey in the West, seemingly at the cost of deeper military ties
between Ankara and Moscow. Turkey has been firm in its political support
for the territorial integrity of Ukraine and has consistently refused to
recognize Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. Over the past few
months, it has dismissed Russian criticism to deliver "Bayraktar" drones
to Ukraine. In the early stages of the war, it closed off the Bosporus
and Dardanelles straits to Russian ships, further raising hopes that it
would align with the rest of NATO in Ukraine's defense. Meanwhile,
[Turkey's active diplomatic efforts for a peaceful resolution of the
conflict have also garnered public praise from its NATO
allies]{.underline}---something Turkish leadership highly appreciated
after years of frosty relations with the West and with national
elections looming in 2023. Senior American diplomats have made several
visits to Turkey since the April launch of a new US-Turkey Strategic
Mechanism aimed at normalizing bilateral relations. Turkish Foreign
Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu has traveled to the United States to meet
Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the first bilateral meeting of
cabinet officials since President Joe Biden took office. [For the first
time in a while, Turkey was not only acting in line with transatlantic
allies but also taking a lead in the region in a way that has bolstered
its importance as a key NATO member]{.underline}. [US officials have
gone as far as to suggest that Turkey transfer its S-400 missile-defense
systems to Ukraine]{.underline} in a bid to finally solve the problem of
Russian air defense systems stationed in a NATO member state and the
consequent Western sanctions imposed on Ankara. **[Turkey has bluntly
rejected that proposal]{.underline}**. **[Instead]{.underline}**, **[it
has slowly allowed domestic problems]{.underline}**, regional
geopolitics, and pragmatism **[to dictate its approach to the
war]{.underline}**. [As a result, Turkish leadership once again appears
eager to **continue business as usual** with an increasingly isolated
Russia]{.underline}. Shifting winds Though only obliged to close the
Bosporus and Dardanelles straits for the naval ships of states at war
under Article 19 of the Montreux Convention, Ankara has denied access to
non-littoral NATO states as well. Turkey's fears of losing out to the
West in its ambitions for a kind of regional ownership of the Black Sea
prevailed over the security threats posed by Russia. Turkey's desire to
limit the presence of NATO vessels in the Black Sea, which might lead to
further escalation with Russia, is understandable---even if not in line
with the Alliance's objectives. It is harder to justify the statements
of Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar wondering whether mines
discovered in the Black Sea had been laid there deliberately to create
an excuse for NATO minesweepers to enter those waters. Turkey is also
blocking the quick addition of Sweden and Finland to NATO, trying to use
the situation to solve its own problems and voice its own security
concerns. It is highly unlikely that Turkish leadership will block the
membership of the two Nordic countries in the long term. Nevertheless,
its current diplomatic bargaining has revealed major differences in
threat perceptions as seen from Ankara and other capitals. While for
most of the European states, the major threat on NATO's eastern borders
is a revisionist Russia, for Turkey it is Kurdish People's Protection
Units (YPG) and Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) fighters operating in Syria
and allegedly finding a safe haven in Finland and Sweden. Obviously,
skyrocketing anti-American sentiments in Turkey and a traditional
mistrust for the West limit the possibilities for cooperation on
Ukraine. Whereas the majority of Turks support Ukraine in this war,
polls show that more than 48 percent blame the United States or NATO for
the conflict while only 34 percent hold Russia responsible. There is a
widespread belief in Turkish society that the war in Ukraine is just
another regional conflict instigated by Western powers after
Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and others. Russia's invasions and
aggression in in South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Nagorno Karabakh,
Transnistria, and more recently in Ukraine and Syria don't evoke a
similar response among Turks. Populist rhetoric, burgeoning ahead of
next year's elections, as well as massive anti-Western propaganda on
Turkish media mostly featuring retired generals, nationalist pundits,
and (pro-)Russian experts with a strong Eurasianist agenda, do not help
either. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's economic and strategic agendas
also depend on close coordination with Moscow. Russia supplies almost
half of Turkish domestic gas demand, provides technology for the
country's first nuclear power plant in Akkuyu, and serves as the source
of more than five million tourists annually. The Kremlin's support is
also vital for Turkey to maintain its presence in the South Caucasus and
Middle East. The recent meeting of Çavuşoğlu with his Russian
counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Ankara clearly showed that Turkey is keen
to stick to mechanisms for cooperation with Russia, like the Astana
Platform in Syria or the 3+3 format in the South Caucuses (which also
involves Iran, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan). Instead of using this
crisis as a chance to decrease its strategic dependence on Russia,
Turkey seems eager to bind itself even more to Moscow within new
formats. Money matters Ukraine has so far largely respected Turkey's
sensitivities and not pushed too hard on sanctions, instead focusing on
arms supplies and Ankara's mediator role. However, that dynamic is
coming under stress with Russian oligarchs using Turkey as a safe haven
to bypass European Union restrictions. According to Lavrov's recent
statements, Russia-Turkey bilateral trade doubled in the first quarter
of 2022, and there are now ongoing talks on expanding the use of
Russia's MIR payments system in Turkey. In March, Erdoğan suggested to
Putin that their countries switch to national currencies or gold in
commercial deals instead of the dollar or euro. Izzet Ekmekcibashi, the
head of the Turkish-Russian Business Council (DEIK), said that more than
one thousand new Russian companies opened in Turkey in March alone. Most
recently, a well-connected Turkish journalist reported on a
Russian-Turkish agreement to move the European headquarters of
forty-three leading Russian companies including Gazprom to Turkey.
Turkish-Russian cooperation in tourism has also quickly developed.
Turkish media outlets have reported that Turkish carriers are operating
438 flights per week to Russia this summer at a time when sanctions have
made it difficult for Moscow to arrange flights. According to the
pro-government Sabah newspaper, Turkish Airlines has signed a deal to
bring 1.5 million Russian tourists over in 2022. The newspaper's report
suggests that Ankara also plans to issue loans under state guarantees to
support Turkish travel companies working with Russian tourists and back
a new airline with the specific mandate of transporting Russian tourists
to Turkey. Ankara, which earlier called on Moscow to end its blockade of
Ukrainian ports so grain exports could restart, is now taking a more
pro-Russia position, advocating for the international community to help
unblock not only Ukraine's but also Russia's trade in grain and
fertilizers through safe logistics, ship insurance, and a return of
Russian banks to the SWIFT system. During Lavrov's recent visit to
Turkey, Çavuşoğlu said that Turkey considered Moscow's demands
"reasonable" and "feasible" and backed easing Western sanctions against
Russia. There is also ample evidence of Ankara's involvement in the
illegal shipment and trade of Ukrainian grain stolen by Russian forces
to the Middle East via the Turkish ports of Samsun, Derince, Bandırma,
and Iskenderun. So far, despite strong evidence of Russian crimes and
official appeals from Ukraine, Turkish authorities have remained silent
on these cases. [These moves by Turkey]{.underline} don't just undermine
its credibility as a mediator between Ukraine and Russia but also [raise
questions about Ankara's geopolitical choices in a broader regional and
transatlantic framework. **As it leans toward Russia**]{.underline} in a
bid for stability at home, **[Turkey risks finding itself estranged from
the West]{.underline}** and aligned with a pariah state on the
international arena. The Ukrainian case will become a major test for
Turkey. Whether Ankara prefers to use it to bridge the gaps with the
West or to burn the bridges remains to be seen.

#### Assistance is [low now]{.underline}

Further facilitating Ankara's shift to a post-NATO stance is the fact
that [the benefits of alliance membership are **already waning** for
Turkey]{.underline}. [Ankara **no longer has access to top-shelf NATO
technology** and appears less interested in defense
guarantees]{.underline}. To be clear, Turkey has benefitted immensely
from NATO membership. Its military was thoroughly shaped by NATO's
culture, standards, and technology. Turkey has also paid back the
alliance as a stalwart member, honoring its obligations by contributing
to missions in Kosovo and Afghanistan and hosting NATO's Land Command.
Its current policy isn't about leaving NATO, but rather about shifting
perspective. Former president Abdullah Gul used to say in the 2010s that
it wasn't important whether Turkey eventually joined the European Union
--- the accession process was about reaching E.U. standards. Once Turkey
had reached that level, it might well decide to "be like Norway" and
refrain from membership. Erdogan's goal with NATO might well be the
reverse. He is already in the club, but sees Turkey's future as being
elsewhere. He wants to move the country into a place where it won't
necessarily leave, but it won't have to worry about what other members
think of it either. Take the most salient issue: air defense. The
backbone of the Turkish air force is the F-16 fighter jet, the product
of very fruitful Turkish-American cooperation in the 1980s. Turkey also
joined the consortium for the F-35, the fifth-generation fighter jet.
During the Syrian Civil War in the early 2010s, Turkey relied on
American-made (American, Dutch, German, and Spanish) Patriot air defense
systems to guard its southern border, and wanted to buy its own
batteries from the United States. But this cooperation broke down. To
this day, when asked in private meetings, Erdogan insists that the
United States would not sell him the Patriot system. American officials
deny this, arguing that they offered favorable terms. Then, soon after
the 2016 coup attempt, Turkey purchased the Russian S-400 air defense
system. The Americans argued that the F-35 could not co-locate with the
Russian system for security reasons, and booted Turkey out of the F-35
program. Now [it isn't even clear whether Congress will allow American
firms to modernize Turkey's F-16 fleet. European countries also have de
facto sanctions on Turkey over issues ranging from Syria policy to human
rights abuses]{.underline}. Given its world view, the Erdogan government
doesn't seem to mind. [Erdogan's stump speech on defense policy features
the story of how U.S. sanctions]{.underline} on Turkey following its
1974 intervention in Cyprus [spurred the development of the country's
defense industry]{.underline}. He is also quick to point out that [when
his government wanted to buy Reaper drones from the United States and
was denied]{.underline}, it set about creating its own world-class drone
program. "Bad neighbors have made us into home owners," Erdogan likes to
say, arguing that U.S. sanctions are now going to drive the development
of the TF-X, Turkey's first indigenous fighter jet.

[Drifting apart from the West]{.underline}

Nonetheless, [Turkey's eagerness to **embark** on]{.underline} a
[nuclear-weapons program should be seen in]{.underline} the **[bigger
context]{.underline}**. There are [clear indications]{.underline} that
the [Eurasianist]{.underline} ideology [creeps in Turkey's **top-ranking
policymakers**]{.underline}. Analysts identify this ideology as a
Turkish version of the Ba'athism in the Arab world. The Eurasianists
argue that Turkey's interests lie outside the Western world and
therefore should join the "anti-imperialist" camp led by Russia and
China.

When speaking about Afghanistan, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan
said: "Imperial powers entered Afghanistan; they have been there for
over 20 years. We also stood by our Afghan brothers against all imperial
powers." A similar statement made by the Pakistani Prime Minister Imran
Khan, revealed the common grounds of the two Sunni forces in their
ideological (and religious) beliefs. He said that the Taliban are
"breaking the chains of slavery." Some would argue that both statesmen
are influenced by the jihad theorist Sayyid Qutb (author of the
influential book "Milestones") and his idea of victimization of Muslims
by foreigners or "imperialists". He believed that western nations are
attempting to undermine Islamic empowerment thus jihad is the tool to
liberate the "suppressed" Muslims from the "imperial powers" (see also 1

Conclusions

It is evident that the [alleged new venture of Turkey in]{.underline}
the [**nuclear weapons**]{.underline} field [is in]{.underline} all
cases a [cause of **serious concern** for]{.underline} its [Western
allies]{.underline}. [Its decision to drift away]{.underline} (1 and 2)
[from]{.underline} the [North Atlantic alliance]{.underline} and become
a [strategically **autonomous** Eurasianist power]{.underline},
[presupposes]{.underline} the [acquisition of a nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}. [This will lead to]{.underline} a [reflexive
nuclear arms race of key states]{.underline} in the wider sensitive
region, [hindering]{.underline} the [already **fragile balances** and
undermining]{.underline} the existing [Euro-Atlantic security
architecture]{.underline}. Such prospect cannot be reversed by false
hopes on a softer policy after a leadership change in the Turkish
elections of 2023, or worst by transactionalism that will boost
[Turkey's **confidence**]{.underline}. It is arguable that [Turkey's
**overambitious** geopolitical balancing]{.underline} act [is
pushing]{.underline} the [limits of its **diplomatic**, economic and
**military** capabilities]{.underline}. [**Therefore restraining its
activities**]{.underline} in these fields (**[especially its military
hardware]{.underline}** / technology as well as the space, missile and
nuclear programs) **[by]{.underline}** the states affected most and
[**the US**,]{.underline} [is most likely to **weaken its eagerness and
tame its revisionist goals**]{.underline}.

[Turkey and Greece]{.underline}, two NATO allies, [nearly
experienced]{.underline} a [**full-fledged** military
conflict]{.underline} in August. Two of their warships collided during a
naval standoff over hydrocarbon exploration in the Eastern
Mediterranean. This follows a similar naval incident in June between
three Turkish vessels and the frigate of another NATO ally, France,
prompting an inquiry that the alliance has been trying to keep under
wraps to prevent further discord among its ranks. Behind these incidents
lies [Turkey's **embrace** of]{.underline} an **[assertive naval
concept]{.underline}**, namely the "blue homeland," that is [poised to
disrupt]{.underline} the [transatlantic alliance]{.underline} in the
years to come.

The "[blue homeland]{.underline}" [is an **irredentist** concept that
claims vast sections of]{.underline} the [**Aegean** and Mediterranean
seas]{.underline}, [including Greek and Cypriot maritime borders and
**hydrocarbon deposits**, for Turkey]{.underline}. What began as a
fringe idea among the anti-Western brass of the Turkish navy has morphed
into a [popular nationalist aspiration]{.underline} fronted by
[President]{.underline} Recep Tayyip [Erdoğan]{.underline}. "Blue
homeland" will continue to damage Ankara's diplomatic relations, since
Erdoğan will find it difficult to step away from maximalist claims he
has personally cultivated.

The [tendency to see]{.underline} the [Turkish president's
**belligerence**]{.underline} merely [as posturing]{.underline} for
domestic consumption, [and failure to develop]{.underline} a concerted
[**transatlantic** strategy]{.underline}, [has provided Erdoğan
with]{.underline} the time and [opportunity to **institutionalize** his
irredentist thinking]{.underline}. **[Absent pushback from the
West]{.underline}**, [Turkish foreign and security policy will reflect
**Erdoğan's worldview** for decades to come]{.underline}. The United
States and the European Union should, in response, work together to
discourage the Turkish president from continuing to play a destabilizing
role in NATO's southeastern flank. They should also engage and support
Turkey's pro-Western dissidents and help amplify their voices in a media
landscape almost entirely dominated by Erdoğan. Coordinating a Western
response --- while extremely difficult --- is essential to mitigating
the most damaging effects of current Turkish foreign policy.

Background to 'Blue Homeland'

The "blue homeland" naval concept, first coined in 2006, does not stem
from Erdoğan's Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party. Instead,
as Ryan Gingeras lays out in detail in his War on the Rocks piece, its
origins lie with two staunchly secularist naval officers who later
developed links with the Maoist-rooted neo-nationalist Homeland Party.
The party and its predecessor, the Workers' Party, were once fierce
opponents of Erdoğan and his political party. However, the Homeland
Party has since entered into a tactical alliance with the Justice and
Development Party as the Turkish president gradually turned to his
former adversaries among the ultranationalists and Eurasianists (a
faction that advocates Turkey joining the Russia- and China-led
anti-Western geopolitical camp) in a bid to hold onto power.

Cem Gürdeniz, a retired Turkish rear admiral who is one of the
architects of the "blue homeland," presents the concept as a response to
an existential threat, and offers it as guaranteeing the ability to
"sleep comfortably at home." Gürdeniz sees the Ottoman failure to
control the seas as the cause of the empire's demise and warns that
naval supremacy is crucial for the survival of the Turkish Republic,
which in his opinion continues to remain in the crosshairs of Western
imperialism. While the "blue homeland" is most immediately linked to
maximalist [Turkish claims]{.underline} in areas where Cyprus and Greece
assert jurisdiction, Gürdeniz ultimately [argues]{.underline} that [it
is]{.underline} also [key for Turkey's expansion of its **political**
and **economic influence**]{.underline} across the region. Since he
believes that "the Mediterranean is not sufficient for an expanding
Turkey," [he urges Ankara to take control of]{.underline} the
"[**Persian Gulf**, Sea of Oman, **Arabian Sea**, Red Sea, the Eastern
waters of the Atlantic Ocean, \[and\] **North Africa**]{.underline}."
Within the Eurasianist paradigm, the "blue homeland" is part of a
broader strategy of confronting the West and establishing Turkish
supremacy in the region.

For Erdoğan, this concept is also a means to expand Islamist influence.
More specifically, [he hopes]{.underline} that [Turkish **domination**
of]{.underline} the [**Eastern Mediterranean** will boost Turkey's
military]{.underline} and proxy [presence in **Libya**, **Syria**,
**Iraq**]{.underline}, and beyond, and thereby [strengthen]{.underline}
the [footprint of the Muslim Brotherhood]{.underline} and its agenda.

A LOT OF HONEY AND SOME VINEGAR

[U.S. **policymakers**]{.underline} have often [pursued]{.underline} a
"[more honey than vinegar]{.underline}" [policy]{.underline} toward
Turkey, [**emphasizing** incentives]{.underline}, [which has not yielded
results]{.underline}. The **[underlying rationale]{.underline}** for
this approach is the idea [that intensive **American
diplomacy**]{.underline} [could encourage Ankara]{.underline} to support
the United States [and]{.underline} that [Turkey is **too
important**]{.underline} a "strategic partner" to risk [creating a
rift.]{.underline} Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump have been willing
to countenance the Turkish government's efforts to undermine U.S. policy
in large part because of the utility of Turkey's Incirlik Air Base.

Yet officials in [Washington tend to **underestimate**]{.underline} the
[hidden costs associated with]{.underline} their [willingness to
**strike agreements** with Turkey]{.underline} over the use of the base.
The problem was brought into sharp relief on July 22, 2015, when, after
a year of negotiations, the Turkish government gave permission for the
anti-ISIS coalition to undertake combat operations from Incirlik. As
part of the deal, the Turks were supposed to increase their operations
against the Islamic State, while U.S. policymakers provided assurances
that the United States would increase its help to Turkey in the fight
against the PKK. The Turks, by their own admission, prioritized the
latter at the expense of the former.20 The Obama administration chose to
overlook the Turkish government's ambivalence about the counter-ISIS
campaign so long as the United States continued to have access to
Incirlik.

The [agreement]{.underline} over the base [had **broader
implications**]{.underline}, however. It [sent]{.underline} the [message
to Ankara that Turkey is **indispensable** to]{.underline} the [United
States]{.underline}, [which leaves Washington **vulnerable** to Turkish
threats]{.underline} to rescind permission to use Incirlik.
[This]{.underline}, in turn, [led **Turkey's leaders** to
believe]{.underline} that [they could act **without regard** for U.S.
interests]{.underline}. Until recently, the [White House had
been]{.underline} publicly [**passive** in response to]{.underline} a
[range of Turkish policies that were]{.underline} unhelpful, even
[damaging]{.underline}, to [American interests]{.underline}. For
example, after Ankara arrested a number of Turkish employees of the U.S.
Embassy and harassed their families in October 2017, the Trump
administration suspended visa processing for Turks traveling to the
United States. In an effort to forestall continued decomposition of
bilateral ties, the administration rescinded the order soon after. In
response, [Turkish leaders]{.underline} have [simply **pocketed American
goodwill** without **any reciprocal effort**, as they have **routinely**
done in the past]{.underline}, and continued to target Foreign Service
nationals.

#### Concessions to Turkey validate their behavior. Increases aggression.

Clearly, democracy is not the only game in town anymore in Central
Europe. [While many Western stakeholders might be tempted to **make
concessions to the region's illiberal strongmen** in order to
preserve]{.underline} EU and [NATO unity]{.underline}, [this
approach]{.underline} was a key enabling factor and [will only
**continue to weaken** European and transatlantic organizations
further]{.underline}. [In the face of the clear authoritarian
threat]{.underline} posed by Russia and China, [challenging these trends
in Central Europe to strengthen the democratic integrity of the Western
alliance is more crucial than ever]{.underline}.

#### Unconditional assistance triggers [aggressive]{.underline} and [non-cooperative]{.underline} allied behavior

**Sullivan 11**, Professor at UNC-Chapel Hill, with Brock Tessman,
Assistant Professor at Georgia and Xiaojun Li, PhD in Political Science
from Stanford (Patricia, "US Military Aid and Recipient State
Cooperation," *Foreign Policy Analysis*, No. 7)

In this model, [we anticipate a paradoxical effect of military aid in
which powerful donor states become dependent on]{.underline} the
[recipients of their military aid]{.underline} (Mott 2002). The United
States gives military aid to gain leverage and influence. But it is in a
competitive market for leverage through aid; it must compete with other
states to keep its influence over client states. At the same time, we
can assume that the United States chooses to invest heavily in training
and equipping the military forces of other countries, with all the
attendant risks this entails, because it needs something from these
states. Materially weak [states]{.underline} can [exploit the fact that
a much stronger donor relies on them to provide some vital
good]{.underline}---and the threat of defection to an alternative
supplier---[to **exert influence over the donor**]{.underline}.
According to Mott (2002), during the Cold War, **[US security assistance
recipients]{.underline}** learned to **[manipulate the United
States]{.underline}** ''by putting Moscow and Washington into an aid
competition, by diversifying across suppliers, and converting the
expected recipient dependence into a perverse sort of supplier
dependence'' (8). Although the Cold War competition with Moscow is no
longer central to US foreign policy, other states and even nonstate
actors have stepped in to replace the Soviet Union as alternative arms
suppliers. Stokke (1995) observes that strong states have typically used
foreign aid ''as a lever to promote objectives set by the donor, which
the recipient government would not have otherwise agreed to'' (12). But
Singer (2003) argues that the increasingly privatized military market
''fundamentally alters this patron-client relationship'' (211). Since
weaker states can now purchase weapons on the open market, the patron's
ability to influence client behavior is greatly diminished. [Generous US
military funding runs the risk of creating **militarily strong**,
**assertive** clients that become **more willing** to ignore US
interests]{.underline} (Mott 2002). [Recipient states should be more
likely to defy the United States if they believe that **the United
States will be**]{.underline} unable or **[unwilling to punish them for
defection]{.underline}** (Walt 2005). US dependence on recipient states
for oil, troop basing, over-flight permission, counternarcotic and
counterterrorism operations, etc... makes withdrawing aid potentially
more costly for the United States than for the aid recipients. It may be
easier for aid recipients to find alternative suppliers than it would be
for the United States to find an equally valuable place to base its
troops.

### Link\-\--Security Cooperation

#### Security Cooperation with [religiously fractious states]{.underline} cause [crackdown]{.underline} on political dissidents and incites [religious]{.underline} [conflict]{.underline}

**Bushey 17**, J.D., SUNY Buffalo Law School, Buffalo, New York, 2007
(Adam, "GOVERNANCE: THE MISSING INGREDIENT IN SECURITY COOPERATION,"
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1038564.pdf)//BB>

Well-intentioned **[SC]{.underline}**/SA [programming can harm partner
nations]{.underline} in four ways. First, [the U.S. could negatively
affect]{.underline} the [rights and protections of citizens within a
country if there is a lack of]{.underline} transparency and [checks and
balances in the defense]{.underline} [institutions]{.underline}. 160 For
example, [when **DOD** has ignored host nation corruption in the past,
which has had **detrimental results**]{.underline}. As written in 2016
by Lieutenant General H. R. McMaster, current U.S. National Security
Advisor, "Paradoxically, avoiding state building or [**sidestepping**
the political causes of state weakness in the hope of avoiding costly or
protracted commitments often **increases costs and extends efforts in
time**]{.underline}."161 In fragile states, the government often does
not have a monopoly on the legitimate use of force. Therefore, [the
default in fragile states is often self-protection]{.underline} forces
and other powerbrokers providing security, distributing aid, delivering
justice, and supplying jobs in lieu of government intervention. They
operate [along ethnic, religious, or tribal lines and are frequently
under political protection]{.underline}. While **[U.S.
assistance]{.underline}** to self-protection forces [may secure
short-term gains]{.underline}, such as in Afghanistan, thes[e forces
over the long run often exploit weaknesses in the political and economic
systems, and "have a tendency to evolve into **predatory
groups**]{.underline}, [**attacking** external **enemies** while
**extorting or preying upon their own community**]{.underline}."162
[Such extortion and corruption actually **reinforce ethnic, religious,
and other divisions** that fuel cycles of violence]{.underline}, thereby
making peace more difficult and prolonging the need for international
forces. Instead, foreign assistance should be used to support the
government in displacing these groups. While this thesis does not
address conflict countries, it should be noted that in 2014, DOD
concluded that the United States' initial support of warlords in
Afghanistan created an environment that exacerbated criminal patronage
networks and fostered corruption, which ultimately had significant
unintended consequences for U.S. strategy.163 Second, [harm can be done
by **empowering a military** that already has undue influence in a
country **without also strengthening oversight
institutions**]{.underline}. [Unmatched military assistance to an
already militarized society may tip the scales of power and permit the
military to act as a tool to "**suppress democratic opposition or
movements**]{.underline}."164 In fact, "a coup or attempted coup
occurred once every four months in Latin America (1945-1972), once every
seven months in Asia (1947-1972), \[and\] once every three months in the
Middle East (1949-1972)."165 There have been forty-four coups in West
Africa alone over the last fifty years.166 Not all of these coups were
antidemocratic, not all were successful, and not all of them were even
against democratically elected regimes. Nonetheless, the point remains
that **[if SC]{.underline}**/SA progra[ms followed the framework of
other U.S. Government foreign assistance initiatives, security sector
programs would be]{.underline} part of a
**[multidimensional]{.underline}** effort, and would incorporate
systematic assessments [and]{.underline} [simultaneously
address]{.underline} weak government policies, inadequate laws, or
[poorly functioning legislatures to counterbalance any assistance given
to a **military with a misbalance of power**]{.underline}. It is USAID's
position that when legislative committee and bill drafter capacity is
increased, additional checks and balances on overly powerful executives
or corrupt ministries of defense can be established as an additional
oversight body to safeguard against power-grabs.167

[Only a handful of other studies systematically investigate the impact
of military aid on civilian populations outside the context of an
ongoing war]{.underline}. This scholarship tends to focus on weapons
transfers. Like much of the literature on economic aid, [the bulk of the
research on arms transfers concludes that]{.underline} major
conventional [weapons transfers to developing countries increase human
rights abuses and **impede democratization**]{.underline} (Blanton
1999a, 1999b, de Soysa, Jackson, and Ormhaug 2010). More recently, Pamp
et al. (2018) find that conventional weapons imports increase the risk
of intrastate conflict onset -- particularly in countries with other
risk factors for political violence. This study echoes results from
Craft and Smaldone (2002) who find that arms imports increase the risk
of civil war in sub-Saharan Africa. In sum, **[extant research leans
toward a pessimistic outlook]{.underline}** on the prospects for foreign
assistance to improve human security in fragile and conflict-affected
countries. While there is some evidence that economic aid could increase
the capacity of governments to deter violent nonstate actors and lessen
armed conflict, [most studies suggest]{.underline} economic aid,
**[military assistance]{.underline}**, and arms transfers all
**[negatively impact governance and human rights
conditions]{.underline}**.

#### It militarizes all of society

**Sullivan 18**, associate professor in the Department of Public Policy
and the Curriculum in Peace, War, and Defense at the University of North
Carolina (Patricia, et al, "Arming the Peace: Foreign Security
Assistance and Human Rights Conditions in Post-Conflict Countries,"
*Defence and Peace Economics*, doi:10.1080/10242694.2018.1558388)//BB

[The]{.underline} second [link between security assistance and human
rights violations arises out of the ability of the regime to distribute
military]{.underline} training, weapons, [equipment]{.underline}, [and
funding as private goods]{.underline}. [In states in which civilian
control of the military is not solidly institutionalized, support from
the military is always essential to regime survival]{.underline} -- and
the military has incentives to resist any loss of authority or autonomy.
**[Foreign military aid]{.underline}** and arms transfers **[can be used
to buy the allegiance of a military elite]{.underline}**, [ensuring
their loyalty in the face of challenges from the **wider
citizenry**]{.underline} (Savage and Caverley 2017, Biddle 2017, Biddle,
Macdonald, and Baker 2018). This [aid **reinforces the privileged
position of the military**, empowering it relative to other state
institutions and giving it an incentive to work with the ruling regime
to repress liberalization efforts that are likely to redistribute power
and resources away from the military]{.underline} (Savage 2017, Call
2002b). In many war-torn countries, the military exercises control over
internal security and is responsible for significant violations of human
rights. In these countries, [major reforms that would improve human
rights conditions after conflict termination are only possible if the
military is significantly weakened and their role in internal security
is curtailed and brought under civilian control]{.underline} (Call
2002b). [But an empowered military is likely to strongly resist any
additional accountability, loss of autonomy, or restriction of its
internal security role]{.underline}. Donors, for their part, may even
encourage the armed forces to retain their role in providing internal
security to suppress threats to the donor's own business or geostrategic
interests (e.g. communist insurgents during the Cold War, drug
traffickers or terrorist groups more recently) (McClintock 1992, Huggins
1998). As Biddle (2017) warns, [security assistance provided
to]{.underline} the armed forces in [authoritarian countries can
encourage transformation of the national military into an abusive
praetorian guard]{.underline} -- [loyal to the regime or a particular
sector of the population, rather than an apolitical defender of the
state]{.underline}. If [foreign security assistance reduces a
government's incentives for investing in public goods]{.underline},
[lowers the marginal cost of repression, and strengthens the security
sector relative to other government institutions, we]{.underline} should
[see increased violations of human rights when post-conflict countries
receive military aid]{.underline}. The receipt of lethal aid from
foreign governments is neither a necessary, nor a sufficient, mechanism
for turning post-conflict countries into repressive states. However, all
else being equal, the provision of lethal aid will increase the
likelihood of a package of policies and choices that will result in
human rights violations.

#### It's exclusively true for military aid

**PSD 20**, Peace Science Digest (The article bolds "foreign security
assistance" and and then boxes the definition of FSA. This cutting makes
clear that the definition is linked to the bolded phrase, "Military Aid
Worsens Human Rights Conditions in Post-Conflict Countries,"
https://peacesciencedigest.org/military-aid-worsens-human-rights-conditions-in-post-conflict-countries/)

Foreign assistance to post-conflict countries is a key feature of global
engagement to encourage peace in such contexts. According to recent
research conducted by Patricia Sullivan, Leo Blanken, and Ian Rice, [the
type of aid matters]{.underline}. They argue that [**foreign security
assistance**]{.underline} \[bold in original\]

Begin definition

[\[**Foreign security assistance**]{.underline}: "any state-authorized
**[provisions of weapons]{.underline}**, **[military
equipment]{.underline}**, funding, **[military training]{.underline}**,
or other capacity building goods and services to the security forces of
a foreign government."\]

End definition

[is linked to state repression]{.underline} in post-conflict countries.
**[Non-military aid]{.underline}**, or Official Development Assistance
(ODA), **[appears to have the opposite
effect]{.underline}**---**[positively correlating with human rights
protection]{.underline}**. [Thus, the type of foreign assistance has a
powerful influence on the "quality of peace"]{.underline} in
post-conflict countries.

The authors find these results by analyzing 171 instances in which
violent conflict ended from 1956 to 2012. These instances are studied as
country-year units in the decade following the end of an armed conflict
between a government and an armed opposition movement within the
country. They test for state repression via a Human Rights Protection
score that measures physical integrity rights violations such as
torture, extrajudicial killings, disappearances, political imprisonment
and executions, and genocide/politicide. The scale runs from -3.13 to
+4.69, where higher values represent better protection of human rights.
For the sample included in the dataset, the scale runs from -2.85 to
+1.58. The dataset also takes into account the presence of peacekeeping
forces, gross domestic product, and other relevant factors.

The key variables of interest include data on ODA, which is relatively
easy to find, and security assistance, which is difficult to find. Most
countries do not release information on military aid and certainly not
systematically enough to warrant inclusion in a dataset. However, the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) produces a
dataset that estimates the volume of global arms imports, which the
authors used for this research. They caution that this approach to
measuring security assistance likely underestimates the true volume of
military trade between countries.

Their results indicate that foreign security assistance is related to
lower levels of human rights protection, resulting in an average 0.23
drop in the Human Rights Protection score (the scale of which is from
-2.85 to +1.58). To compare, if a country experiences a renewed violent
conflict, the Human Rights Protection score drops 0.59 points on that
same scale. This comparison provides a benchmark for the seriousness of
the Human Rights Protection score drop as a result of military aid. ODA,
on the other hand, is associated with improved human rights. In
generating predicted values for Human Rights Protection scores in
post-conflict countries, ODA "appears to improve human rights conditions
in the decade after conflict termination."

The authors explain the effect of military aid on state repression by
focusing on the strategic choices available to national leaders in
countries emerging from armed conflict. These national leaders generally
have two pathways to maintain power: (1) focus on securing public goods
for the largest number of people---like investing in public
education---or (2) focus on securing private goods for the minimum
number of people required to maintain power---like investing in security
forces to enhance the state's repressive power. [Given]{.underline} the
[resource constraints]{.underline} common in post-conflict countries,
[leaders must make hard decisions about how to allocate
funds]{.underline}. Simply put, [foreign security assistance tips the
scale such that repression]{.underline}, or the second pathway, [becomes
appealing]{.underline} for governments. In short, the authors argue that
"foreign security assistance reduces a government's incentives for
investing in public goods, lowers the marginal cost of repression, and
strengthens the security sector relative to other government
institutions."

The authors point to examples in U.S. foreign policy to demonstrate this
point. For instance, U.S. security assistance to South Korea following
the Korean War bolstered a repressive state that committed numerous
human rights violations until mass protests ushered in a democratic
government decades later. The authors link these examples to a larger
conversation about the "quality of peace" in post-conflict countries.
The end of formal hostilities is one way to define peace. However, the
authors argue that state repression of dissent, which security
assistance encourages, especially in the form of human rights violations
like "torture, extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, and
political imprisonment," is a poor "quality of peace" despite the formal
end of civil war.

Informing Practice

The "quality of peace" that takes shape after war is critically
important because the risk of armed conflict recurrence is high.
According to data collected by Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) (see
"Conflict Recurrence" in Continued Reading), 60% of all armed conflicts
recur within the decade following the end of hostilities due to
"unresolved grievances" in the post-war period. An exclusive focus on
bringing an end to hostilities, without a clear commitment to human
rights or a plan for how the country might address the structural
conditions which led to war, may only serve to further entrench existing
grievances and structural conditions that will beget more violence.

[International interventions aimed at]{.underline} ending war and
[preventing armed conflict recurrence need to consider how their actions
may influence these outcomes]{.underline}. As we discussed in our
previous Digest analysis, "Presence of UN Police Associated With
Nonviolent Protests in Post-Civil War Countries," **[militarized
solutions]{.underline}**, whether in policing or peacekeeping, **[result
in worse outcomes for human rights]{.underline}**, [as militarization
entrenches a cycle of violence that **normalizes violence** as an
acceptable form of political expression]{.underline}. [This insight is
critically important for how]{.underline} national
governments---particularly those of powerful, highly militarized
countries like [the U.S.---conceive of their foreign assistance,
especially whether they favor **military or non-military
aid**]{.underline} to post-conflict countries. Rather than encourage
peace and democracy, which foreign aid is intended to do, it appears
that security assistance has the opposite effect, encouraging state
repression and increasing the likelihood of armed conflict recurrence.
Many have warned about the militarization of U.S. foreign policy,
including individuals within the Defense Department and intelligence
agencies (see "The Problems of a Militarized Foreign Policy for
America's Premier Intelligence Agency" in Continued Reading). They have
questioned how [an over-reliance on the military and militarized
solutions]{.underline} affects how the U.S. is perceived around the
world. While perceptions are important to international relations and
foreign policy, foreign security assistance, more fundamentally,
[**undermines the goals** of creating a more peaceful and democratic
world]{.underline}. This article demonstrates that a reliance on
security assistance as a form of international aid worsens outcomes for
recipient countries.

[The clear policy recommendation]{.underline} from this article **[is to
increase non-military]{.underline}** ODA \[Official Development
[Assistance]{.underline} \] to countries emerging from war.
[Non-military aid could incentivize spending in social welfare
programs]{.underline} and/or transitional justice mechanisms necessary
to address grievances that encouraged war in the first place and that
may continue in the post-war period, **[thus contributing
to]{.underline}** a strong quality of **[peace]{.underline}**. [Moving
away from an over-reliance on military spending]{.underline} and

in their home countries includes nearly 70 Turkish personnel. The first
and highest-ranking Turkish official on the list is identifiable as
Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, who is recorded as having trained in the
United States between January and June of 1987.

Since taking over Turkey's Ministry of Defense in 2018, Akar has
overseen a particularly violent era of Turkish foreign policy: a
devastating invasion and occupation of northeastern Syria, multiple
attacks on Iraqi Kurdistan, and an escalating campaign of extrajudicial
killings of Kurdish and Yezidi leaders in the fight against ISIS and the
effort to stabilize their homelands.

In an ironic twist, both Akar and the Defense Ministry as a whole were
sanctioned by the United States for "endangering innocent civilians" and
"undermining the campaign to defeat ISIS" during the October 2019
invasion of the Syrian cities of Serekaniye and Tal Abyad.

Today, [as Turkey launches a new military invasion of Iraqi Kurdistan
and cracks down harder than ever on Kurdish and non-Kurdish political
opposition alike]{.underline}, the State Department has requested
\$1,450,000 in IMET aid for the country for fiscal year 2023. Given the

it sought to do away with the conflicts tarnishing its reputation and

[**Myth**: Erdogan is a strongman America can]{.underline} work with or
[appease]{.underline}.

Despite the evidence, [it]{.underline} still [might be tempting to
conclude]{.underline} that [**Erdoğan** could]{.underline} prove to be
an authoritarian leader with whom Washington could [have a mutually
beneficial, **transactional** relationship]{.underline}---as it did with
Egypt's General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, for example, or even with the
Turkish generals who came to power after the country's 1980 coup. In
this light, [observers]{.underline} have been [tempted to dismiss
Erdoğan's most **provocative** positions]{.underline}, [especially in
foreign policy]{.underline}, [as rhetoric designed for **domestic
consumption** that does not]{.underline} necessarily [reflect Ankara's
**actual interests**]{.underline}. Yet this [**optimism**
misunderstands]{.underline} both the [depth and **sincerity** of
Erdoğan's **anti-Western** attitudes and]{.underline} the [extent to
which his **populist rhetoric** comes to **shape** policy]{.underline}.
This assessment also ignores the extent to which [Erdoğan's
**consolidation of power** makes Turkish policy **more erratic**, more
dependent on Erdoğan's shifting **personal ambitions**]{.underline},
and, in many cases, more divorced from reality.12

Erdoğan's apparently sincere belief that the United States orchestrated
a coup attempt against him, for example, is perhaps the most telling
example of how deep Erdoğan's anti-American thinking goes and how easily
it can influence Turkish policy. Following the trauma that unfolded on
the night of July 15, Turkish government rhetoric---coming from the
president, the prime minister, the AKP cabinet, and the pro-AKP
media---has argued that the United States backed the effort with a
degree of vehemence and consistency that suggests real conviction.
Turkey's labor minister, Süleyman Soylu, was perhaps the most direct,
declaring, "America is behind the coup."13 Prime Minister Binali
Yıldırım was only slightly subtler, saying Turkey would "consider itself
at war with any country that supports Gülen."14 Ibrahim
Karagül---writing in a newspaper controlled by Erdoğan's in-laws---went
further, arguing without evidence that the United States actually tried
to kill the Turkish president. From Erdoğan to ordinary citizens, it
seemed impossible that such an event could have unfolded without
Washington's complicity, especially when the coup's supposed mastermind,
Gülen, resides in the United States. In subsequent statements, Turkish
officials argued that as long as Washington kept "sheltering" Gülen, it
could never be considered a friend of Turkey's.

The result of this suspicion is that even if the administration tried to
reassure Ankara by, say, handing over Gülen, the sense of abiding
hostility would remain, creating a fundamental cleaving of interests.
More importantly, Erdoğan long ago realized the value of anti-American
posturing as a way of mobilizing his base and discrediting his
opposition. With Erdoğan trying to consolidate his power as president
and fend off the potential fallout from a likely economic crash, this
anti-American approach will become even more important to his domestic
position.

Yet even absent this unique anti-American dynamic, there is good reason
to doubt that appeasement could ever be an effective
strategy---especially when Turkish policy is driven by domestic
concerns. The story of Turkey's failed refugee deal with Europe might be
the best example of this. When European leaders worked out an
arrangement with Ankara in which Turkey would receive financial and
political benefits for preventing the flow of Syrian refugees into
Europe, many observers denounced it as a cynical capitulation,
particularly as European leaders went on to mute their criticism of
Erdoğan in order to ensure the deal's survival.

The German government even allowed a lawsuit to proceed against a
comedian who mocked Erdoğan on television.15 But if the deal was
cynical, it was also short-lived and short-sighted.16 Turkey's eagerness
to arrest Kurdish politicians and human rights advocates---who, in
calling for peace, supposedly supported the PKK---made it impossible to
amend Turkey's anti-terrorism laws to come into compliance with the
legal requirements for EU visaliberalization.17 With Turkey refusing to
make this change, and, more broadly, persecuting critics and driving the
country toward a destabilizing civil conflict, EU officials were
confronted with the distinct possibility that allowing Turks to travel
to Europe visa-free would result in a new wave of Turkish refugees and
asylum seekers in place of the Syrians they were already trying to
limit. As a result, the European Union was unable to move forward with
the liberalization process, which had been one of the most popular
concessions offered by Europe. Turkish politicians responded to this
impasse by lashing out at the European Union, condemning Europe's
hypocrisy and supposed support for terrorism.18 Not surprisingly, this
reaction only deepened the backlash against the deal among European
critics, making it more difficult for pro-inclusion European leaders to
further fulfill their end of the agreement, and leaving the deal
teetering on the edge of collapse. 19 In short, even when European
leaders were willing to look the other way on Erdoğan's political
excesses and sins, it was his very authoritarianism that ended up
undermining the security goals they were trying to cooperate with Turkey
on.

**[Europe's experience]{.underline}**, indeed, [has been indicative
of]{.underline} the [results Washington]{.underline} has [obtained
in]{.underline} its [periodic efforts to curtail **criticism** of
Turkish authoritarianism in return for concessions on crucial **foreign
policy issues**]{.underline}. While Washington has inspired considerable
anger in Ankara by cooperating with Syrian Kurds in the war against
ISIS, [it has at]{.underline} the [**same time** tried to
**assuage**]{.underline} that [anger by turning a]{.underline} blind eye
to Ankara's blatant assaults on basic freedoms. Vice President Joe
Biden's visit to Turkey at the height of the government's postcoup purge
stood out as a particularly striking example of this approach,
especially when he seemed to imply that there was no need for Washington
to speak out as no one had actually been executed yet. While in the
short run [Biden's]{.underline} silence [may have won **limited
cooperation** from Ankara]{.underline}, [it has not prevented tensions
from **escalating**]{.underline} over plans for how to take Raqqa from
ISIS or over threats to disrupt the operation by targeting Syrian
Kurdish forces.20 Indeed, as [Ankara has **redoubled**]{.underline} its
[crackdown on Kurdish politicians within Turkey]{.underline}, arresting
a number of leading members of the pro-Kurdish People's Democracy
Party,21 [it has]{.underline} only [increased]{.underline} the [odds
that Turkey's **domestic Kurdish conflict** will spill over into
Syria]{.underline} and [**undermine** the **war against ISIS**
there]{.underline}. In other words, Washington looked the other way on
Turkey's domestic fight against the PKK in the hope that this would win
greater cooperation in Syria, but it is now Ankara's domestic war with
the PKK that is pushing Turkey toward intervening against the YPG.22
[Trying to sideline Turkey's]{.underline} domestic [challenges in the

### Link\-\--AT Cooperation Turn\-\--General

#### Security cooperation causes anti-alignment from recipient states. It triggers [allied aggression]{.underline} and [entrapment]{.underline}

**Sullivan 11**, Professor at UNC-Chapel Hill, with Brock Tessman,
Assistant Professor at Georgia and Xiaojun Li, PhD in Political Science
from Stanford (Patricia, "US Military Aid and Recipient State
Cooperation," *Foreign Policy Analysis*, No. 7)//BB

The United States spends more than eleven billion dollars per year on
direct military assistance to foreign governments and substate groups
(USAID 2009). The American government expresses a wide variety of goals
motivating their use of military assistance as a foreign policy tool.
[Frequently, US administrations have explicitly linked military
aid]{.underline} or arms transfers **[to a quid-pro-quo expectation of
compliance from a government]{.underline}** (Sislin 1994). More
generally, military assistance is expected to augment US national
security by increasing recipient state cooperation with US objectives.
According to the State Department\'s 2007 Report to Congress: Section
1206(f) of the 2006 National Defense Authorization Act:

Security cooperation remains a critical foreign policy tool that allows
the United States to advance its national security interests
worldwide.... Building partner nation security capacity is one of the
most important strategic requirements for the United States to promote
international security, advance U.S. interests and prevail in the war
against terrorism (1).

[Importantly, the policies that guide the provision of US military aid
have **changed** significantly in **recent years**]{.underline}. Shortly
after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the
[Bush]{.underline} administration [sent Congress an antiterrorism bill
that would have lifted all restrictions on military aid and arms
transfers]{.underline} to foreign governments in cases where such
assistance could "help fight terrorism" (Federation of American
Scientists 2002, 1). [The provision specifically called for lifting bans
on counterterrorism aid for states with a history of human rights abuses
or noncooperation]{.underline} on counterterrorism.1 [The
bill]{.underline} was eventually modified to include "sunset clauses"
and some requirements for Congressional oversight, but it [initiated a
year of radical changes in the way US military aid was allocated,
restricted, and justified]{.underline}. In 2002, Congress amended the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations, removing Armenia, Azerbaijan,
and Tajikistan from a list of states barred from receiving US arms
transfers. The United States has also extended military aid to Pakistan,
the Philippines, Turkey, Georgia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Oman,
Yemen, Uzbekistan, and Columbia, among others, in the name of rewarding
or encouraging cooperation in the fight against terrorism (DSCA News
Releases, 2002--2008).

**[What are the consequences]{.underline}** of US military aid in a
rapidly changing, unpredictable global security environment? In this
study, we systematically investigate the effects of US military
assistance on recipient state behavior toward the United States between
1990 and 2004. Our analysis improves upon existing studies in several
ways. First, we develop three competing, clearly defined, and
falsifiable theoretical models of the relationship between military aid
and recipient state behavior. These models---Arms for Influence, Lonely
Superpower, and Reverse Leverage---range from a conventional
understanding of US military aid as a way to buy cooperation from the
recipient state to a more counterintuitive assessment of US aid as a
sign of American dependence on the recipient government for the
provision of some foreign policy good. Second, our focus on the
post-Cold War era allows us to measure recipient state compliance using
events data rather than the UN voting records that most studies rely on.
Third, [we employ multiple statistical methods in order to match our
empirical models to]{.underline} the [hypotheses]{.underline} we are
testing. For example, a number of our hypotheses predict a reciprocal
relationship between military aid and cooperation or anticipate
selection effects. To address these challenges, [we use both a
simultaneous equations model with fixed effects and a two-stage Heckman
model]{.underline}. Finally, we control for pre-existing preference
similarity between the United States and aid recipients in our empirical
analyses, so that [our results capture the influence military aid has on
recipient state behavior]{.underline} independent of any dyadic
predisposition toward cooperation or conflict.

Our research is relevant to larger academic debates about the utility
and limitations of foreign aid as a policy instrument. We attempt to
evaluate the effectiveness of foreign aid, and security assistance more
specifically, in terms of its ability to move recipients toward more
cooperative foreign policies. [We test the conventional "arms for
influence" explanation of military aid]{.underline} [but find that the
relationship between US assistance and recipient state behavior is
considerably more complicated]{.underline}. In general, we find that
[military aid does not lead to more cooperative behavior]{.underline} on
the part of recipient states. With limited exceptions, [increasing
levels of US aid are **linked to a significant reduction in cooperative
foreign policy behavior** with the United States]{.underline}. US
reaction to recipient state behavior is also somewhat counterintuitive;
instead of using a carrot-and-stick approach to military aid
allocations, our results show that increased recipient state cooperation
is likely to lead to subsequent reductions in US military assistance.

[The results of our inquiry also have implications for US foreign
policy. Policymakers]{.underline} and military advisors [invariably
justify military assistance to foreign governments on the basis of an
expectation that providing military aid to these governments will
increase US influence over the recipients\' foreign or domestic
policies]{.underline}. In the 1980s, despite concerns about Pakistan\'s
efforts to develop nuclear weapons, the Reagan administration began
providing direct military assistance to Pakistan and funneling money and
weapons to Afghan rebels through Pakistan\'s Inter-Services Intelligence
(ISI) after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. The primary objective
was to support Islamic insurgents fighting the USSR and the
Soviet-backed government of Afghanistan. And, in one important sense,
the US policy was a tremendous success. The Afghan rebels prevailed and
the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan---a result some attribute directly
to US assistance and, more specifically, to the highly accurate FIM-92
Stinger Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs) the US provided. However, several
hundred of the Stinger missiles are unaccounted for, and Osama bin Laden
is thought to have procured a number of Stingers and other SAMs with
which he could target US military or civilian aircraft (Jane\'s
Intelligence Review). Moreover, the Pakistan Army\'s Inter-Services
Intelligence diverted an unknown quantity of US arms and assistance to
groups it considered less threatening to Pakistan than the Afghan
mujahedeen---including some radically anti-US Islamic factions (Debate
in US House, June 22, 2001). After a total ban on military assistance to
Pakistan throughout the 1990s, the United States resumed providing
billions of dollars of military assistance and arms to Pakistan after
the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (Grimmett 2009). And, once
again, there are concerns that Pakistan is channeling some of the money
to extremist groups on its border with India. Perhaps more seriously,
the ISI remains closely linked to the Taliban militants the American
military is fighting in Afghanistan (Gopal 2008; Mazzetti and Schmitt
2009; Murphy 2010).

#### Military support causes more defiance

**Sullivan 11**, Professor at UNC-Chapel Hill, with Brock Tessman,
Assistant Professor at Georgia and Xiaojun Li, PhD in Political Science
from Stanford (Patricia, "US Military Aid and Recipient State
Cooperation," *Foreign Policy Analysis*, No. 7)//BB

In this paper, we attempted **[a systematic investigation]{.underline}**
into the relationship between US military aid and the level of foreign
policy cooperation exhibited by the states that receive that aid. We
aimed to improve on the existing literature by building and testing
three explicit theoretical models (Arms for Influence, Lonely Superpower
and Reverse Leverage), focusing on a new measure of cooperation
generated from events data rather than UN voting records, and
controlling for preference similarity, so that our results [capture the
influence military aid has on recipient state behavior independent of
any dyadic predisposition toward cooperation or conflict]{.underline}.

[We test seven hypotheses associated with three different theoretical
models]{.underline} and find mixed results. [There is little evidence in
favor of the Arms for Influence model]{.underline}: **[there is an
inverse relationship between]{.underline}** absolute levels **[of US
military aid and recipient state cooperation]{.underline}**, and there
is no relationship at all between recipient state dependence on US aid
and recipient state behavior. Thus, while the Lonely Superpower
hypothesis was on the right track by predicting an unorthodox
relationship between aid and cooperation, it did not perform as well as
some of the Reverse Leverage hypotheses when it came to explaining
exactly what form such unorthodoxy would take.

In several ways, [the Reverse Leverage model was quite
accurate]{.underline}: (i) [states receiving military aid from the
United States **exhibit lower levels of cooperation** than states that
do not receive military aid]{.underline}, (ii) in the population of all
states, higher levels of [military aid appear to **produce more defiant
behavior**]{.underline}, and (iii) the United States does not punish
defiance with reductions in aid or reward greater cooperation with
increases in military aid. Together, these results suggest that US
military assistance is allocated for reasons that are largely
independent of overall recipient state behavior toward the United
States. The Reverse Leverage model contends that military aid is
delivered to states that the United States depends on for security
reasons. Realizing their leverage over Washington, [states that receive
high amounts of aid are actually more able to engage in **uncooperative
behavior**]{.underline} than are states that the United States does not
depend so heavily upon. We attempted to test for the effects of an aid
recipient\'s "security value" directly by comparing US allies to
nonallies. Consistent with the Reverse Leverage model, we find that
[states with a defensive alliance with the United States
are]{.underline} more likely to receive US military aid but [less
**likely to respond to aid by increasing their cooperation with American
preferences**]{.underline}.

#### Studies!

**Sullivan 11**, Professor at UNC-Chapel Hill, with Brock Tessman,
Assistant Professor at Georgia and Xiaojun Li, PhD in Political Science
from Stanford (Patricia, "US Military Aid and Recipient State
Cooperation," *Foreign Policy Analysis*, No. 7)//BB

In the results from equation 1, we see that, contrary to Hypothesis 1a
(Arms for Influence), but consistent with Hypothesis 3b (Reverse
Leverage), [there is a **significant, negative correlation** between
levels of US military aid and recipient state cooperation]{.underline}.
Economic aid, on the other hand, appears to have no effect on recipient
state cooperation. The recipient country\'s GDP and S score are also not
correlated with a state\'s behavior toward the United States. Recipient
states that are democratic, and those that have US troops stationed on
their soil, appear to be more cooperative with the United States, all
else equal.

Table 3 presents results from using equation 1 to simulate the
substantive impact of the statistically significant independent
variables on recipient state cooperation. States that do not receive any
US military aid display an average level of cooperation with the United
States of +1.5 when all other variables are held constant at their
means. The model predicts that states that obtain the average amount of
US military aid (\$20 million) will be less cooperative---scoring an
average of −11 on the cooperation-conflict scale. [An increase in US
military aid]{.underline} to one standard deviation above the mean
**[leads to]{.underline}** an additional six-point **[reduction
in]{.underline}** the monthly **[cooperation]{.underline}** score **[of
the recipient state]{.underline}**. In contrast, an increase in the
number of US troops from its mean to one standard deviation above the
mean raises recipient state cooperation almost one point. Democratic
recipients are on average four points more cooperative than
nondemocratic recipients.

As U.S. President Joe Biden and his team focus on the Iran nuclear file,
the war in **[Syria]{.underline}** [remains a festering wound at the
heart of the Middle East]{.underline}. Although the current
administration has made no dramatic departures from the approach of
previous administrations, its decision to deprioritize the conflict
comes at a particularly bad time. Opportunities to find a solution to
the Syria crisis are now emerging---and the United States should devote
the diplomatic energy necessary to seize them. The keys to success after
years of failure include not just high-level engagement but a realistic
assessment of what can be achieved in any deal.

[The risks in]{.underline} keeping **[Syria]{.underline}** on the back
burner **[are significant]{.underline}**. [The conflict is already a
strategic train wreck]{.underline}: a [victory by]{.underline} President
Bashar al-**[Assad]{.underline}**'s regime [would send a message to
autocrats across the globe that mass murder is a viable tactic for
retaining power and signal the regional ascendance of Assad's Russian
and Iranian enablers]{.underline}. [It has also spawned geopolitical
threats]{.underline}, from the rise of the Islamic State (also known as
**[ISIS]{.underline}**), to the deployment of **[Iranian precision
missiles]{.underline}** that target Israel, to the **[massive refugee
flows]{.underline}** [that threaten to destabilize neighboring states
and Europe]{.underline}. And for Syrians themselves, the decade-long
civil war has resulted in horrendous casualties, displaced half the
population from their homes, and left most citizens destitute. [If left
unaddressed, these dynamics will **threaten to destabilize the Middle
East** for years to come.]{.underline}

[Syria's war has]{.underline} also [drawn in the U.S., Israeli, and
Turkish militaries, and the risk of clashes between them and Iranian,
Russian, and Syrian forces remains very real]{.underline}. Washington
views the Syrian Democratic Forces' (SDF) enclave in northeastern Syria
as an important ally against ISIS, but Ankara views the Kurdish group as
a terrorist threat. Two recent provocations---Assad's violation in July
of a 2017 cease-fire in the southwest that had been negotiated between
U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin and an
attack by Iranian-backed fighters in October against U.S. forces at
their al-Tanf base in southern Syria---came without noticeable American
response and could encourage Assad or the Iranians to escalate in areas
patrolled by Turkish or U.S. troops.

on Ukraine is further

destabilising Syria," Lowy Institute,
https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/how-turkey-s-position-ukraine-further-destabilising-syria)//BB

Turkey continues to signal a Syria operation against this backdrop.
Erdogan's most substantial threat came in a 1 June speech to AKP MPs,
homing in on the Kurdish-controlled towns of Tel Rifaat and Manbij.

Targeting these areas carries substantial risks. In response, local
Kurdish groups in Tel Rifaat have organised with Iranian, Russian, and
pro-government forces. For its part, Moscow has publicly and privately
expressed discomfort over a Turkish advance multiple times and increased
patrols in these areas. To date, Turkey has not substantially built up
its forces along the border, although the Turkish-backed Syrian National
Army (SNA) opposition militias could lead an assault.

Ankara's goal of repatriating one million Syrian refugees to "Safe
Zones" in northern Syria will perpetuate this crisis and remains
ambiguous.

Still, many dynamics that hindered Erdoğan's offensive last year still
exist, particularly regarding the Russian and US presence in the
northwest and northeast of Syria, respectively. Given geopolitical
interests and their patronage of stakeholders in these areas, neither
state appears keen on ceding ground to Ankara.

Indeed, Washington rejects any assault given its support for the
Kurd-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). US forces stationed east of the
Euphrates River to fight the Islamic State also block an offensive,
which explains Erdoğan's focus on Manbij and Tel Rifaat.

However, Moscow is disinclined to support an offensive or land-swap deal
that previously undergirded Turkish offensives west of the Euphrates.
Former US Special Representative for Syria Engagement Jim Jeffrey has
indicated this on numerous occasions based on previous diplomatic
efforts.

This position probably hardened given Turkey's stance against Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, not limited to Erdoğan's decision to invoke the
Montreux Convention -- closing the Bosporus and Dardanelles Straits --
and close its skies to Russian-Syria flights. That said, Russia could be
interested in Ankara's continued blocking of Finland and Sweden's NATO
accession in exchange for some land.

Regardless, immediate consequences abound should an attack occur. The
region has not recovered from the 2021 drought -- the worst in 70 years
-- or a substantial deterioration in living standards and international
aid. Furthermore, both Manbij and Tel Rifaat, home to over 550,000
people, hold a significant number of internally displaced people within
an area already hosting roughly 2.8 million.

Ankara's goal of repatriating one million Syrian refugees to "Safe
Zones" in northern Syria will perpetuate this crisis and remains
ambiguous. Between 2016 and 2021, only around 110,000 Syrians returned
from Turkey, representing less than three per cent of the 3.7 million
Syrian refugees today. The areas from previous incursions continue to
suffer from institutional corruption and bleak economic outlooks,
resulting in riots in al-Bab, making voluntary returns unlikely.

Politically, Turkish advancements will probably harden Syria's de facto
partition as no stakeholders are prepared to cede ground for a political
agreement. A larger Turkish presence in Syria will deepen disagreements
between these actors at the expense of peace and stability.

Regarding security, an offensive will foster increased violent reactions
from the YPG, who intend to induce a state of chaos in Turkish-held
areas to prevent resettlement and ethnic cleansing. This continues a
cycle of violence that destabilises the entirety of northern Syria --
opening the door for extremist groups such as Islamic State to flourish
at the expense of the average Syrian.

#### The impact is existential

BEIRUT, Lebanon --- One week after Islamic State fighters attacked a
prison in northeastern Syria, where they have held out despite a heavy
assault by a Kurdish-led militia backed by the United States, the
terrorist organization published its version of what had gone down.

In its official magazine, it mocked how many times in its history its
foes had declared the Islamic State to be defeated. Its surprise attack
on the prison, it crowed, had made its enemies "shout in frustration:
'They have returned again!'"

That description was not entirely wrong.

The battle for the prison, in the city of Hasaka, killed hundreds of
people, drew in U.S. troops and [offered a stark reminder that [three
years after the collapse of the Islamic State]{.mark}'s so-called
caliphate, [the group's ability to sow chaotic violence
persists]{.mark}, experts said]{.underline}. On Saturday, about 60 ISIS
fighters still controlled part of the prison.

In Iraq, ISIS recently killed 10 soldiers and an officer at an army post
and beheaded a police officer on camera. In Syria, it has assassinated
scores of local leaders, and it extorts businesses to finance its
operations. In Afghanistan, the withdrawal of American forces in August
has left it to battle the Taliban, with often disastrous consequences
for the civilians caught in the middle.

The Islamic State, which once controlled territory the size of Britain
that spanned the Syria-Iraq border, is not as powerful as it once was,
**[but [experts]{.mark} [say it could be biding its time]{.mark} until
conditions in the unstable countries where it thrives provide it with
new chances to expand]{.underline}**.

"There is no U.S. endgame in either Syria or Iraq, and the prison is
just one example of this failure to work toward a long-term solution,"
said Craig Whiteside, an associate professor at the U.S. Naval War
College who studies the group. "[[It]{.mark} really [is just a matter of
time for ISIS]{.mark} [before another opportunity presents
itself]{.mark}. All they have to do is to hang on until
then]{.underline}."

The Islamic State, whose history goes back to the insurgency following
the United States' invasion of Iraq in 2003, reached the summit of its
powers around 2015, when it ruled multiple cities in Syria and Iraq,
attracted droves of foreign fighters from as far away as China and
Australia, and ran a sophisticated propaganda machine that inspired or
directed foreign attacks from Berlin to San Bernardino, Calif.

A military coalition led by the United States partnered with local
forces in Syria and Iraq to roll it back, until a Kurdish-led militia,
the Syrian Democratic Forces, pushed it from its last patch of territory
in early 2019.

Since then, the organization has morphed from a top-down, military-style
bureaucracy to a more diffuse and decentralized insurgency, according to
terrorism experts and regional security officials.

But the importance of the prison as a target suggested that last week's
attack would have been green lit "by the highest levels," Mr. Whiteside
said. The group's ability to mobilize dozens of fighters and break into
a prison that American and S.D.F. officials long suspected was a target
was an achievement and a propaganda coup no matter how the siege turns
out.

A senior American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
the probable goal of the operation was to free some of the group's
senior or midlevel leaders and fighters with specific skills, like
bomb-making. The official estimated that perhaps 200 prisoners had
escaped.

The Islamic State has struggled to rebuild. The killing of its leader,
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in October 2019 deprived it of a unifying figure,
and its new leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, is largely
unknown. Tighter border controls have blocked foreign fighters from
getting to Iraq and Syria, and persistent raids by U.S.-backed forces in
both countries have largely pushed it out of the big cities and into the
peripheries.

In Iraq, the group ramped up attacks in 2019 and 2020, but they have
declined since then in both quantity and quality, according to an
in-depth analysis of attack data published this month by Michael
Knights, the Jill and Jay Bernstein Fellow at the Washington Institute
for Near East Policy, and his colleague, Alex Almeida.

"For now, at the outset of 2022, the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq is
at a very low ebb, with recorded attack numbers that rival the lowest
ever recorded," they wrote.

They cite a range of factors: a greater security presence in rural
areas, thermal cameras that can detect militants moving at night,
frequent security sweeps and a campaign of "decapitation strikes"
against the group's leaders.

The authors do not draw conclusions about the group's future, but
suggest that [[ISIS]{.mark} may be [saving its resources]{.mark} until
circumstances give it an opportunity to break ou]{.underline}t.

[[The group has passed through weak stretches before]{.mark}, the
authors note, [and]{.mark} has still [managed to
rebound]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Before it attacked the prison in Hasaka last week, ISIS in Syria was
primarily operating in the country's sparsely populated east, where its
fighters sought refuge in the desert to plot attacks on Syrian
government and Kurdish-led forces, according to analysts and local
residents.

From 2018 to 2021, it stepped up a campaign of assassinations of local
leaders and tribal figures, killing more than 200, according to a study
by DeirEzzor24, an activist network.

More recently, it has extorted local businesses for cash, spread fliers
against the U.S.-backed S.D.F. and carried out a string of attacks on
isolated checkpoints that has caused some to be abandoned, said Dareen
Khalifa, senior Syria analyst with the International Crisis Group.

["[The reality is that it got worse in 2021]{.mark}, not
[because]{.mark} there were so many attacks on checkpoints, but [there
were enough attacks to make the internal security forces scared to man
checkpoints]{.mark}]{.underline}," she said.

Other factors have contributed to ISIS' persistence, she said, citing
the S.D.F.'s struggle to forge trusted relations with local residents in
overwhelmingly Arab areas, porous borders, crushing poverty that makes
it easier for the jihadists to smuggle weapons and people, and the
area's overall instability.

Some sudden disruption, like financial problems for the S.D.F. and its
affiliated administration, a new military incursion by Turkey similar to
the one in 2019 or a precipitous withdrawal of the 700 U.S. troops based
in the area to support the S.D.F., could give the jihadists an opening,
Ms. Khalifa said.

"ISIS is a local insurgency, and might not be an imminent transnational
risk," she said. "**[But [if]{.mark} [there is a]{.mark} [vacuum]{.mark}
of some sort [in Syria]{.mark}, [this is where]{.mark} these
[movements]{.mark} really [thrive]{.mark}. [That]{.mark} [is when it
becomes more of an external threat."]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### New Turkish attacks in Syria cause ISIS resurgence

Seldin 5-27-2022, VOA's National Security Correspondent tracking
developments in intelligence, counterterrorism, and cyber since March
2015, following a stint covering the Pentagon. His current focus has
been on terror groups such as ISIS and al-Qaida, while also covering
U.S. election security, as well as covering developments with Russia,
China, North Korea and other global hotspots (Jeff, "US Allies in NE
Syria Warn Against New Turkish Incursion," VoA News,
https://www.voanews.com/a/us-allies-in-ne-syria-warn-against-new-turkish-incursion-/6592567.html)//BB

U.S. allies in northeastern Syria are increasingly worried about
Turkey's pledge to launch a new round of military operations in the
region, warning it could embolden and even strengthen the Islamic State
terror group.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the new round of
operations earlier this week Monday, pledging to expand existing
30-kilometer-deep security zones on the Syrian side of the Turkish
border.

But despite assurances from Turkey's National Security Council that any
military actions will "not target our neighbors' territorial integrity
and sovereignty in any way,\" officials with the Kurdish-led Syrian
Democratic Forces and the SDF's political wing tell VOA a Turkish
incursion could spell disaster.

"Any attempt of invasion will shift the focus of the SDF to fight it
since it's a much higher priority to \[defend\] your lands than fighting
ISIS in non-Kurdish areas," a source close to SDF leadership said,
speaking on the condition of anonymity because the source was not
authorized to speak to the media.

"Any Turkish aggression will derail guarding thousands of ISIS captives
and the ongoing weekly operations against the terror group in the
region," the source said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group.
"The ISIS prisons and camps will be much more vulnerable to jail breaks
than now."

Other Kurdish officials are also voicing concern about the security of
the dozen or so prisons across northeastern Syria, currently housing
about 10,000 IS fighters, some of which could be in areas that would be
targeted by Turkish forces.

\"That task (of securing prisons) is not a small one," Sinam Mohamad,
U.S. representative for the SDF's political wing, the Syrian Democratic
Council (SDC), told VOA through a spokesperson.

Should Turkey launch military operations in northeastern Syria, "ISIS
fighters will be in a more favorable position to be successful in any
operations to free those ISIS fighters who have been in prison,\"
Mohamad said.

Other SDC officials warn that IS has been getting stronger, adding it
has been just four months since the terror group carried out a week-long
attack on the al-Sina'a prison in Hasakah, a makeshift detention
facility that housed an estimated 4,000 IS fighters.

Already, the SDF has raised concerns about increased drone attacks and
shelling by Turkish-backed forces in northern Syria.

And SDC officials say they have been in touch with the United States to
express their fears about the potential Turkish incursion, a message
that has resonated in Washington.

"We're obviously very concerned about the Turks announcement that they
intend to increase their military activity in northern Syria," Pentagon
press secretary John Kirby told reporters Thursday. "It could draw off
potential SDF personnel to move away from the counter-ISIS fight, which
is obviously what we\'re focused on in northern Syria.

Kirby said the Pentagon has been in daily contact with its SDF partners,
who echoed that IS remains "a viable threat."

U.S. diplomatic officials say they have also been in contact with
Turkey, both through the State Department and from the U.S. Embassy in
Ankara, to get a better sense of what Turkey is planning.

But State Department spokesman Ned Price earlier this week warned Turkey
against launching a new round of military operations in northern Syria.

"We condemn any escalation. We support maintenance of the current
ceasefire lines," Price said. "Any new offensive would further undermine
regional stability and put at risk U.S. forces in the coalition's
campaign against ISIS."

Making matters worse, [Turkey's]{.underline} current [posture toward the
Aegean is **not solely** the product of domestic politics]{.underline}.
In assessing the impact the war in Ukraine could have upon Turkish
foreign policy, scholar Selim Koru suggested that [Erdogan may sense a

it]{.underline}." To some extent, Turkey's expressions of insecurity
echo those of Russia's in the lead-up to the war with Ukraine. Like the
case of Turkish-Greek relations, Russia and Ukraine share a long history
of antagonism and disagreement over matters of territory. Like Russian
supporters of Putin's war against Ukraine, **[prominent voices in

The [[Aegean]{.mark} Sea between Greece and Turkey [hosts]{.mark} one of
the [world's **highest concentrations** of]{.mark} **high-tech
[weaponry]{.mark}**. Sixty-seven surface ships and two dozen submarines
are deployed on a body of water the size of Lake Superior]{.underline}.
The [two air forces command 448 fighter jets armed with **smart bombs**
and **guided missiles**]{.underline}. On land, 832 heavy tanks and more
than 2,500 lighter artillery vehicles---[[as much]{.mark} tank
[firepower as in all the **rest of Europe**]{.mark}
**combined**]{.underline}---could rapidly be brought to bear along a
Greek-Turkish border only 105 miles long.

[These arsenals]{.underline}, built up over decades and constantly
modernized, [were]{.underline} not merely [a boon to U.S. and German
defence contractors]{.underline}. Western policymakers wanted to believe
that loyalty to NATO's mission of containing the USSR, rather than
regional rivalries, motivated this exemplary level of Greek and Turkish
defense spending. After the Soviet Union collapsed, [good
diplomacy]{.underline} and Turkey's EU aspirations [made it possible,
most of the time, to overlook the downsides of an [**arms race**]{.mark}
between **uneasy neighbors**. Recently, however, the Aegean [has
become]{.mark} a **[dangerous]{.mark}ly narrow sea**.]{.underline}

For decades, [[Turki]{.mark}sh military aircraft have **regularly
[violated]{.mark}** [Greece's]{.mark} 10-mile [airspace]{.mark} around
its islands]{.underline}, on the grounds that Greece's territorial
waters extend only six nautical miles from shore, and that air and sea
borders should match. Turkish ships also ignore the territorial waters
around a number of small islands whose Greek ownership Turkey questions.
These ships and planes are intercepted by their Greek counterparts, and
mock dogfights result. [Occasionally **fatal accidents**
occur.]{.underline}

Kostas [Grivas]{.underline}, who [teaches advanced weapons systems at
the Hellenic Army Academy, calls it a "a [unique **theater of
confrontation**]{.mark}," where "land, sea and air forces are
simultaneously in use in a **very confined area**]{.underline}, and
there is an enormous amount of weapons systems and men-at-arms in
deployment." [In the event of war]{.underline}, he believes, [it would
be very [difficult to maintain
**c**]{.mark}ommand-**[and-c]{.mark}**ontrol systems [because of]{.mark}
the **[intensity]{.mark} and speed** of activity, meaning heavy
fratricidal losses]{.underline}. In such chaos, the outcome might
ultimately be up to local commanders' ability to take intelligent
initiatives. [An Aegean war]{.underline}, Grivas says, [would
[resemble]{.mark}]{.underline} "a mini-[[**nuclear war** because]{.mark}
there will be [so much high-tech ordnance **discharged** it will
cause]{.mark} a huge amount of **[damage]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

The prospect of such hostilities has been suddenly brought closer this
year, following events that are individually and as a series without
parallel in recent decades.

Last autumn, Greek foreign minister Nikos Kotzias expressed concern that
[Turkey had become an "**irritable power**."]{.underline} What inspired
this concern was [a record **3,317 airspace** and **1,998 territorial
water** violations recorded in the Aegean last
year]{.underline}---respectively double and quadruple the previous
year's numbers. "Our job is to behave responsibly," Kotzias declared, so
he invited Recep Tayyip Erdogan to become the first Turkish president in
six decades to visit Greece.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan's December 7 visit was a disaster. On its eve,
Erdogan gave an interview calling for revisions of the Lausanne Treaty
of 1923. This is the treaty that defines the borders of the modern
Turkish state, while guaranteeing the rights of Greek and Muslim
minorities in the two countries. It has kept Greece and Turkey at peace
for a century and forms the bedrock of their détente. No Greek or
Turkish head of state or government had ever publicly called for its
revision. Greece's President Prokopis Pavlopoulos reacted by
overstepping his role as ceremonial head of state to lecture Erdogan.
Lausanne, he asserted, was "non-negotiable."

\"It has no gaps. It needs neither revision nor updating. It stands as
it is, it covers absolutely the issues that it needs to cover, and
stresses that among other things it leaves no leeway for gray zones or
minority issues,\" Pavlopoulos said.

Erdogan gave as good as he got. Greece had plunged its Muslim minority
into poverty, he said, and is racially prejudiced against it. Erdogan
also demanded of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras the extradition of ten
Turkish military officers who fled to Greece after the failed July 2016
coup. The Greek Supreme Court had barred their extradition on the
grounds that their lives would be endangered in Turkey. The government
cannot overrule the decision and there is no higher court of appeal, but
Erdogan insisted: "What I told Mr. Tsipras is that these putschists may
be returned to Turkey, a country that has abolished the death penalty, a
country where torture does not take place."

Kotzias's charm offensive has since collapsed. A planned February
revival of the Greek-Turkish Supreme Council, a diplomatic forum, never
took place, and a May visit to Athens by the Turkish foreign minister is
very much in doubt. But there is worse.

On February 12, a Turkish coast guard vessel rammed a Greek one while
performing what the Greek coast guard called "dangerous maneuvers
inconsistent with international collision avoidance practices." Turkish
Prime Minister Binali Yildirim called Tsipras to explain that the
ramming was accidental; but the fact that it happened near Imia, a pair
of Greek islets whose ownership Turkey has disputed for 20 years,
suggests to the Greeks a territorial power play.

Turkey upped the ante on the last day of February, arresting two Greek
officers who apparently strayed into Turkish territory while on a
routine patrol on the Thracian border. The standard practice for both
sides during the last three decades has been to return wayward patrols
at the nearest checkpoint after a routine procedure. Turkish authorities
instead jailed the men and charged them with illegal entry. More serious
charges may follow. Greek Defense minister Panos Kammenos refers to the
two soldiers as "hostages," and Greek public opinion takes for granted
their seizure as connected with the ten Turkish military fugitives.

Since these incidents, polls say [**92 percent** of Greeks believe
Turkey constitutes Greece's **biggest threat**]{.underline}. Is Turkey
generating grievances as a pretext for war? Who would gain from such a
war? How would America react? And why has Erdogan chosen this moment to
escalate tension?

Brinkmanship in 1996: preview of a far worse confrontation?

"[What [I worry about]{.mark} is]{.underline} the [risk of an
**[unintentional confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline}," says U.S.
ambassador to Athens Geoffrey Pyatt. Greece and Turkey nearly did
stumble into war two decades ago. On Christmas Day 1995, the Figen Akat,
[a small Turkish cargo ship, ran aground on the western twin islet of
**Imia**]{.underline}. A [Greek tug was dispatched to refloat her, but
the Turkish captain refused Greek help]{.underline}, saying he was in
Turkish territorial waters. He eventually accepted Greek assistance, but
not before the Turkish government had voiced a claim to the Imia islets
as Turkish.

In the new year, the mayor of the largest nearby Greek island, Kalymnos,
hoisted a Greek flag on Imia. The owners of a newly-licensed Turkish
television channel CNN Turk decided to boost ratings by filming two
journalists replacing the Greek flag with a Turkish one. Prime Minister
Tansu Ciller fueled the fire. "We can't let a foreign flag fly on
Turkish soil. The flag will come down," she said.

"The Turkish claims have no basis at all. There is no space for
negotiations in ... matters which concern our sovereignty," said Greek
Premier Kostas Simitis. Greece landed special forces on one of the two
islets while Turkish frogmen took the other. As many as 20 Greek and
Turkish ships and submarines converged on Imia (or Kardik, as the Turks
call it).

On January 31, [the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates **[[intervened]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
avert an unintended war. "In 1996 the Americans stepped in and that
sobered both sides," says retired ambassador Christos Rozakis, one of
Greece's leading experts on international law. "We parted under the
understanding, "no ships, no flags," and reverted to the status quo
ante. It wasn't exactly that, but until the latest incident it was
almost that. Greek shepherds didn't herd their goats there any more, but
neither did Turks go there."

Treaties vs. politics

[[Imia]{.mark} stands as a [textbook case of **calculated escalation**
leading to]{.mark} the brink of an **[unintended war]{.mark}**, and
[conditions now]{.mark} are even [**more conducive** to]{.mark} such a
[war]{.mark} than they were in 1996, [because **new**]{.mark} **causes**
of **[instability]{.mark}** have been added]{.underline} to older ones.

Returns: Possible War between Greece and Turkey," 9/10/20,
<https://www.cato.org/blog/old-nato-nightmare-returns-possible-war-between-greece-turkey>

[[U.S. and other Western leaders have long worried about what to do if
an **armed conflict** ever **erupt**ed between two **NATO members**.
**Rapidly rising tensions** between **Greece and Turkey**]{.mark},
primarily involving a maritime dispute over oil, natural gas, and other
resources]{.underline} under the eastern Mediterranean[, **[have brought
that nightmare to the surface]{.mark}** once again]{.underline}.
Germany's Foreign Minister, Heiko Maas, warned both governments in late
August against further military escalation. "[[Fire is being played with
and any small spark could **lead to catastrophe**,"]{.mark} he
stressed]{.underline}. The heart of the North Atlantic Treaty is Article
5, which proclaims that an attack on any member of the Alliance will be
considered an attack on all. The underlying assumption is that there
would then be a collective response to repel and punish the aggressor.
Obviously, that approach would not work if two NATO signatories went to
war against each other. Even determining which country was the aggressor
and which the victim could be quite challenging. Throughout NATO's
history, the greatest risk of an intra‐​alliance conflict has always been
one involving Greece and Turkey. Although both countries joined NATO in
1952, mutual membership in that security partnership did not erase the
centuries of animosity between the two populations. Athens and Ankara
have nearly come to blows on several occasions, most notably when Turkey
invaded majority‐​Greek Cyprus in 1974, proceeded to occupy nearly 40
percent of the island, and expelled Greek Cypriots from that territory.
The occupation continues to this day. There have been several lesser,
but still worrisome, incidents over the years. Among other problems,
Turkish military planes continuously violate Greek airspace. Athens then
sends its fighter planes up to intercept and challenge the Turkish
aircraft---in some years as many as 2,000 times. Thus far, there have
been no armed clashes, but as I've written elsewhere, similar games of
aerial "chicken" involving the United States and such countries as
Russia and China are extremely reckless. One such episode between U.S.
and Chinese planes in 2001 resulted in a midair collision that killed
the Chinese pilot and created an ugly diplomatic row between Washington
and Beijing. All it would take is one miscalculation by a Greek or
Turkish pilot to trigger a similar (or worse) crisis between Athens and
Ankara. The Cyprus episode suggests what Washington's reaction would be
to the outbreak of a Greco‐​Turkish armed conflict. Under the guidance of
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the United States pressured both
countries to dampen their quarrel, and Kissinger used maximum leverage
to get the other NATO members to adopt the same position. However,
Kissinger's stance was far from neutral. Even though Turkey had been the
aggressor, the \[US\] United States soon tilted in favor of Ankara's
position. Congressional anger compelled Gerald Ford's administration to
implement sanctions against the Turkish government, but the White House
moved inexorably to dilute those measures as quickly as possible. That
approach continued under Jimmy Carter's administration, and by the
beginning of the 1980s, the restrictions were effectively moot.
Washington's response reflected the belief that Turkey was a much more
important ally than Greece in terms of strategic considerations. There
is little reason to believe that the U.S. attitude has changed. Even if
a Biden administration would not share Donald Trump's apparent
admiration for Turkey's autocratic president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, both
security and economic calculations would push Washington toward that
conclusion. There is one important difference, though, between the
Cyprus crisis and a possible new confrontation between Athens and
Ankara. Key NATO powers, most notably France and Italy, are not happy
about Erdogan's increasingly undemocratic rule and his government's
maverick, often pro‐​Russian, behavior on security issues. In addition,
France has openly challenged Turkey's territorial and resource claims in
the eastern Mediterranean, and in late August, French warships and
planes joined a joint military exercise with Greece and Cyprus to convey
a blunt message of displeasure to Ankara. Washington may find it far
more difficult today to drag its NATO allies into taking a pro‐​Turkish
stance in case of an armed confrontation between Greece and Turkey than
it did in 1974. [The mere prospect of a possible **[Greco‐​Turkish war
underscores]{.mark}** one of the major [drawbacks of]{.mark} the United
States being the leader of a nearly 30‐​member military
**[alliance]{.mark}**. [America]{.mark} automatically [is]{.mark}
**[entangled]{.mark}** [in the grievances and quarrels of every one of

each other, that situation can create not only a headache but an
outright nightmare for the United States.

in the Mediterranean Sea," 9/9/20,
<https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/whats-driving-turkish-aggression-mediterranean-sea>

[[Turkey is putting]{.mark} its 50-year view on [maritime rights into
practice through]{.mark} its **[Blue Homeland]{.mark}** Doctrine,
growing its naval and commercial presence in Mediterranean waters that
it claims are part of its exclusive economic zones]{.underline} (EEZs).
Oil and gas exploration is becoming a crucial tool in implementing this
strategy. [But Ankara\'s attempts to claim extensive maritime resource
rights [risk]{.mark} broadening to [a **wider conflict with Greece and**
]{.mark}other **[NATO allies]{.mark}** that would bring foreign energy
projects, and potentially the United States, into the fray]{.underline}.
Turkey\'s Maritime Ambitions Turkey claims that all of its neighboring
waters in the Aegean, Black and Mediterranean seas deserve special
treatment under international law, and that the islands in the Aegean
Sea (which Greece controls the majority of) should not enjoy the same
rights as large countries like Turkey with lengthy coastlines. The
international community never adopted these distinctions, which is why
Turkey is not a signatory to the United Nations Convention for the Law
of the Sea (UNCLOS) and prefers to resolve disputes through bilateral
negotiations in lieu of not international arbitration. This has so far
led to two major disputes with Greece in the Aegean and Mediterranean
seas, as well as a major dispute with Cyprus in the eastern
Mediterranean. Turkey\'s most important dispute is in the Aegean Sea,
where thousands of Greek islands help boost Greece\'s maritime claims
over Turkey\'s, and where the two countries disagree on how to even
start drawing a maritime border due to the disparity in the number of
islands between them. Turkey has just three islands in the Aegean Sea,
while Greece claims more than 3,000. Given the higher number of Greek
islands, Turkey has long maintained that any expansion of Greek maritime
claims from six nautical miles (nm) to 12 nm off Greece\'s shores would
constitute a \"casus belli,\" or cause of war. While Greece and Turkey
have nearly gone to war several times over disputes in the Aegean Sea,
the two countries have so far avoided declaring full EEZs in the region,
as well as claiming territorial waters beyond six nautical miles. But
that doesn\'t mean they can\'t do so in the future. Ankara has argued
that if both Greece and Turkey extended their claims beyond 12 nm,
Turkey\'s percent ownership of the territory would only marginally
increase, while Greece would see its territorial control reach nearly
three-quarters of the entire Aegean Sea. The use of Greece\'s islands in
the Aegean Sea to demarcate a maritime border for EEZs, which extend up
to 200 nm from the coast, would also leave Turkey with virtually no
rights to the natural resources and fisheries in the Aegean Sea. Turkey
has argued that a more equitable way to split the sea\'s resources would
be by ignoring the islands altogether and starting off with an
equidistant line between the Greek and Turkish mainlands. Ankara Takes
Action [By more **[aggressively flexing its claims]{.mark}** through
energy exploration and naval exercises in the eastern Mediterranean,
[Turkey is trying to]{.mark} both **[legitimize its]{.mark}** declared
**[EEZ]{.mark}** claim, as well as delegitimize any potential EEZ claims
in the region that Greece has through its islands of Crete, Rhodes and
Kastellorizo]{.underline}. Kastellorizo, in particular, has the
potential to generate a significant EEZ claim for Greece that could
connect to Cyprus\'s own claimed EEZ, thus significantly limiting
Turkish claims to resources between Crete and Cyprus. [Further
[escalation]{.mark} could [result in]{.mark} Greece finally claiming its
full EEZ in the eastern Mediterranean, which Athens has so far been
reluctant to do for fear of spurring [a]{.mark} wider
**[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Protected by a Turkish naval convoy,
Turkey\'s Oruc Reis surveying vessel has been active throughout the
Mediterranean Sea since the beginning of the year. Turkey\'s December
2019 maritime agreement with Libya\'s Government of National Accord aims
to legitimize Turkey\'s claims by establishing a border between Turkish
and Libyan waters that ignores Crete and Kastellorizo. On Aug. 27, the
Greek parliament ratified a maritime border agreement with Egypt aimed
at countering Turkey\'s pact with Libya by legitimizing a potential EEZ
border generated via its control of Crete with Egypt. Greece\'s deal
with Egypt is a first step in potentially declaring a full EEZ in the
eastern Mediterranean, but the agreement with Egypt does not legitimize
potential claims that Kastellorizo could give Greece rights to.
[[Turkey]{.mark} has also been actively [attempting to **delegitimize
Cyprus\'**]{.mark} claimed **[EEZ]{.mark}** in the eastern Mediterranean
by both conducting energy exploration in waters that Cyprus directly
claims, as well as harassing foreign companies that are operating on
behalf of the Cypriot government]{.underline}. Turkey has argued that
Cyprus\' claimed EEZ is not legal because it was not done in
coordination with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which Ankara
recognizes as a legitimate government for all of Cyprus. Turkey also
argues that, as an island, Cyprus cannot claim a full EEZ. Turkey\'s
Yavuz vessel is currently drilling off the coast of Western Cyprus.
Turkey\'s Barbados vessel is also currently researching in the Northern
Cyprus territorial waters that Turkey recognizes as a part of an oil
exploration block held by the state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corporation.
In 2018, the Turkish navy prevented the Italian oil firm Eni from
drilling on its Cuttlefish prospect in an exploration block the company
received from Cyprus. The Specter of War [Turkey\'s increased
[provocations]{.mark} will continue to [drive]{.mark} the United States
and other [NATO]{.mark} countries, including France and Greece, [to
boost]{.mark} their own naval **[presence]{.mark}** in the eastern
Mediterranean]{.underline}. Both Turkey and Greece will try to refrain
from crossing red lines that could spur a larger confrontation that
neither wants, but the higher presence of ships in the eastern
Mediterranean will nonetheless increase the possibility of incidents, as
evidenced by the Aug. 10 collision between the Greek frigate Limnos and
the Turkish frigate Kemal Reis. International mediation would likely
avoid further escalation to a military conflict between Greece and
Turkey, but is unlikely to result in a diplomatic solution to their
dispute. [[In the case of]{.mark} a wider **[crisis]{.mark}**, most NATO
[members would]{.mark} view Turkey as the aggressor and would likely
**[back Greece]{.mark}**. This would likely [reinforce Ankara\'s]{.mark}
overall pursuit of its **[maritime strategy]{.mark}** and [intensifying
national security push by offering Turkey further proof that NATO does
not prioritize its national security priorities]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Countries can only leave NATO on their own accord, which Turkey remains
is unlikely to do. [Instead, [Ankara would]{.mark} probably continue to
**[reduce collaboration with NATO]{.mark}** countries]{.underline}.
Despite Cyprus and Greece\'s calls for a more significant response to
deter Turkey\'s behavior, the European Union will likely be hesitant to
impose more drastic measures for fear of prompting Ankara to reduce
cooperation on migration and other EU priorities. Unless Turkey starts
to more directly protect its claims in the Aegean Sea, fires upon a
Greek or another European vessel, or conducts drilling or exploration
activities around Crete, Brussels will likely limit its sanctions
pressure to companies and individuals supporting Turkish activities in
the Mediterranean. Decisions on implementing EU sanctions require
unanimity among the bloc\'s member states. And some countries, such as
Germany, are more concerned about aggressive sanctions only inflaming
Brussels\' tensions with Turkey. If the European Union does not take
significant action on Turkey, Cyprus is now threatening to veto proposed
EU sanctions against Belarus amid the country\'s ongoing political
crisis. This may result in slightly stronger EU sanctions that target
more Turkish individuals and companies, but more broad-based economic
sanctions against the Turkish government remain unlikely. Energy
Projects in the Crossfire [The United States will likely let the
European Union continue to take the lead in responding to Turkey\'s
attempts to delegitimize Greek and Cypriot maritime claims, but
[Chevron\'s]{.mark} recent [entry into the eastern Mediterranean]{.mark}
could eventually **[draw Washington]{.mark}** more [directly **in**to
the conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. On July 20, Chevron announced an
agreement to acquire the Houston-based oil and gas firm Noble Energy,
which operates both the Leviathan gas field off the coast of Israel and
the Aphrodite gas field off the coast of Cyprus. Ankara, however, will
likely adopt a more hands-off approach to U.S. companies operating in
the region, as the United States would be more willing to impose
hardline sanctions in response to American firms being drawn into its
maritime disputes. By continuing to increase the cost of developing
resources in Cypriot waters, Turkey\'s ongoing harassment of foreign
energy firms will drive its neighbors closer together on both maritime
security and energy exploration issues. [But [it could]{.mark} also
[**potentially** halt]{.mark} their [construction of]{.mark} the
proposed East Med [pipeline]{.mark}.]{.underline} Cyprus, Egypt, Greece
and Israel created the East Mediterranean Gas Forum in 2019. The quartet
has since collaborated to construct the roughly \$6 billion pipeline
project, which would carry natural gas from the eastern Mediterranean to
Europe. Under international law, Turkey is technically required to allow
other countries to build pipelines through its EEZ. But Ankara retains
the power to demand that any constructors of the East Med pipeline
adhere to its environmental reviews and oversight, which would be de
facto recognition of Turkey\'s EEZ. Otherwise, Turkey could send its
navy to harass or intercept vessels involved with construction as Ankara
did in 2018 with a drillship planning to spud a well in Cypriot waters.

### !\-\--Turns Case

#### Greece-Turkey war decimates NATO

**Salacanin 20 ---** Stasa Salacanin, Author for Inside Arabia.
10/21/2020. "NATO's Dilemma Over Greece-Turkey Friction", Inside Arabia,
https://insidearabia.com/natos-dilemma-over-greece-turkey-friction/ WMK

[Tensions between Turkey and Greece have increased]{.underline} after
**[a series of disputes]{.underline}** over the interpretation of
[international maritime law and territorial waters]{.underline} in the
Eastern Mediterranean, [where rich gas deposits have been
found.]{.underline} Last month, Greek and Turkish military ships
collided in contested waters near the Greek island of Kastellorizo,
which lies just 2 km (1.2 miles) from the Turkish coast. Turkish
military vessels guarded the country's seismic research ship. This
[flexing of military muscles]{.underline} has **[raised concerns of
confrontation]{.underline}** [between the two NATO members, who share a
long history of disputes.]{.underline}

In short, while Greece has insisted that a country's continental shelf
should be measured from islands that belong to a particular state -- an
interpretation that has been supported by the UN Law of the Sea --Turkey
builds its case by claiming that a nation's continental shelf should be
measured from its mainland coast.

Turkey's exploration of the Mediterranean for hydrocarbons has pushed it
at loggerheads over energy resources with many other countries in the
region. Ankara has been criticized for its foreign and security
policies, which have often been seen as incompatible with the interests
of NATO members. Many analysts suggest that one of the main causes for
the current discord with Turkey lies in Ankara's implementation of the
Blue Homeland Doctrine developed over 15 years ago, that seeks to expand
Turkey's influence in the Mediterranean as well as the Black Sea, and to
exploit energy and other resources.

The disagreement grew when Greece signed a maritime deal with Egypt in
August, to counter Ankara's agreement with the Tripoli-based Government
of National Accord, which defines the maritime border between Turkey and
Libya, and permits Turkey to jointly exploit energy sources in the
Mediterranean. The accord has triggered a series of incidents in the
Mediterranean, adding to the list of Turkey's unilateral moves in Syria
and Libya as well as the decision to buy Russian S-400, and pushing
Ankara in serious odds with NATO and the EU.

[NATO has tried to de-escalate the situation.]{.underline} Its Chief,
Jens Stoltenberg, [encouraged the Greek and Turkish sides to engage in
dialogue]{.underline}, along with Germany and the US---two influential
NATO members seeking to take a mediator role in the dispute. The EU,
however, explicitly threatened Turkey with sanctions if it continues
with its unilateral drilling activities and aggressive moves.

Although NATO has never been designed to adjudicate disputes between its
members, [the alliance has developed some basic deconfliction
arrangements]{.underline}, such as minimum distances between aircrafts
and ships and the establishment of hotlines.

The [later]{.underline} has been [set up as a military mechanism to
prevent serious clashes following talks between Turkey and Greece at the
NATO headquarters in Brussels.]{.underline} The hotline will enable
direct communication between the two sides, similar to one that was
installed during the Cold War between Moscow and Washington.

Whil[e current initiatives may calm the brewing tension in the short
run, it is obvious that]{.underline} **[NATO faces much deeper dilemmas,
which seriously undermine its cohesion]{.underline}**.

According to Barah Mikaïl, Founding Director of Stractegia -- a
Madrid-based consultancy specializing in Middle Eastern geopolitics,
this is why NATO's Secretary-General is trying to mediate between the
two countries. "NATO -- and most of its members -- know that they need
to calm things down if they want to maintain NATO's image of cohesion.
They also know that Turkey is an important military, geographic, and
strategic partner, and that if they don't handle all this with care,
they could be facing a fierce and aggressive reaction from Turkey," he
told Inside Arabia.

It seems that [Turkey is]{.underline} trying to write a new set of rules
while **[testing the patience of the alliance]{.underline}**, [knowing
that it is an important geostrategic member of NATO.]{.underline} On the
other hand, Tarik Basbugoglu, a PhD candidate at Glasgow Caledonian
University in Scotland and an expert on Turkey's foreign policy,
explained that although Turkey does not want to leave NATO, it has been
disappointed over the lack of understanding and solidarity it received
regarding the Gulenist military coup, Turkish military operations in
Syria against Syrian Kurds, and Turkish policy in the broader MENA
region.

In Mikaïl's view, Turkey is trying to get the maximum benefit before it
takes a break and considers negotiations, recognizing that it is in a
position of power. "It did so in Libya; it tried to do so in Syria; it
is pushing in the same way on Nagorno Karabakh---of course,
Ankara/Erdogan could always push things beyond some red lines and create
a risk zone, but Turks also know where to stop," Mikaïl explained. "And
they know how to pressure NATO in order to get what they want, and to
make themselves feared and taken \[seriously\]," he added.

Nevertheless, it seems that [NATO has become]{.underline} ~~paralyzed~~
\[[immobilized]{.underline}\] **[over the Turkey-Greece]{.underline}**
issue---two nominal allies that have never been very friendly.

Basbugoglu observes that although the Trump administration seemed to be
neutral towards the recent Turkish-Greek tensions, US Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo went to Cyprus and Greece to calm down both sides. He
recalls that Pompeo warned the Turkish government to not escalate the
friction by sending the Oruc Reis survey vessel to the East
Mediterranean during his Cyprus visit.

Yet, Basbugoglu noted, the US Embassy in Turkey expressed its support to
Ankara by saying that the US did not accept the Sevilla map which
increases the maritime border zones of Greece. Therefore, according to
Basbugoglu, "the Trump leadership sought to play a constructive role in
decreasing the tensions in the East Mediterranean."

However, in Mikaïl's opinion, [it is impossible to broker between Greece
and Turkey without taking sid]{.underline}es, as their demands are
diametrically opposed. "This is why an 'external' mediation may be
needed, but **[there is not much NATO can do since it also cares about
keeping in its ranks a country]{.underline}** \[Turkey\] that is
essential for both its military and geographic projection -- especially
towards Russia, the endless raison d'être for NATO," he added.

Moreover, by being overly obsessed with Russia and focusing primarily on
its eastern flank, NATO has long neglected its southern flank that is
highly vulnerable and exposed to the destructive impact of Middle
Eastern conflicts and growing tensions among its members.

Furthermore, in the absence of firm leadership, [NATO has **not been
able to respond to the particular interests of some of its larger
members**]{.underline}. Thus countries like [Turkey often pursued their
own geopolitical tactics **which collided with the aims of other members
of the alliance,**]{.underline} [causing frictions that]{.underline}
**[seriously undermine the stability and very foundation of the
organization.]{.underline}**

When speaking about Afghanistan, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan

over 20 years. We also stood by our Afghan brothers against all imperial
powers." A similar statement made by the Pakistani Prime Minister Imran
Khan, revealed the common grounds of the two Sunni forces in their
ideological (and religious) beliefs. He said that the Taliban are
"breaking the chains of slavery." Some would argue that both statesmen
are influenced by the jihad theorist Sayyid Qutb (author of the
influential book "Milestones") and his idea of victimization of Muslims
by foreigners or "imperialists". He believed that western nations are
attempting to undermine Islamic empowerment thus jihad is the tool to
liberate the "suppressed" Muslims from the "imperial powers" (see also 1

Iran's nuclear program is at least temporarily halted under the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action struck with the international community in
2015. But if the limits in this deal were contravened for any reason, it
is possible that Iran could still join the nuclear club. If Iran
acquires nuclear weapons, [it is also possible]{.underline} that [other
states in the region]{.underline}, including **[Turkey]{.underline}**,
Egypt, or Saudi Arabia [could]{.underline} attempt to [acquire nuclear
weapons in **response**]{.underline}.88 [While fears of a rapid and
complete **nuclear cascade**]{.underline} in the region [are probably
overblown]{.underline}, [it is [possible]{.mark}]{.underline}, if not
likely, [that one or two **[additional states]{.mark}** [would
join]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[nuclear club]{.mark}**]{.underline}
within the course of several decades if Iran goes nuclear.89

[[The nuclear balance]{.underline}]{.mark} of power [between Iran and

**[lack]{.mark} many of the [safeguards]{.mark}** []{.mark}that existed

]{.mark}of a direct line of [**communication**]{.mark} between Iran and

[and]{.mark}]{.underline}, in Israel, a lack of strategic depth and [a
strategic [culture that emphasizes]{.mark} preemption.]{.underline}

Iran and Israel have viewed each other as strategic competitors since
the Iranian Revolution in 1979; Israel has directly come into conflict
with Iran's proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas. Iran has also frequently
clashed with Israel's superpower patron, the United States. In 1988, the
United States and Iran engaged in a major naval battle as part of the
Tanker War, the U.S. Navy's largest engagement since the end of World
War II. Iran sponsored proxy attacks that killed U.S. service personnel
for a decade in Iraq and Afghanistan. And Tehran and Washington
frequently exchange threats and counter-threats in the Persian Gulf and
over the Strait of Hormuz.90 It is, therefore, conceivable that a

### U\-\--No Prolif Now

#### Turkey's focusing on [non-nuclear]{.underline} ballistic missile capabilities. 

Can **Kasapoğlu 19,** IPC-Stiftung Mercator Fellow at the Centre for
Applied Turkey Studies (CATS), "Turkey's Nuclear Onset: Military Policy,
Techno-Nationalism Trends and Defense Industrial Capabilities", October
2019,

[Turkey's **ballistic missile program** **remains solely
conventional**]{.underline}

A closer look at Turkey's ballistic missile program gives a hint as to
Ankara's most probable motives with regard to its nuclear rhetoric.

The Bora line forms the core of Turkey's missile program. The line can
be traced back to Ankara's initial defense cooperation with Beijing in
the late 1990s. Based on the Chinese B-611 tactical ballistic missile as
a baseline, Turkey has made significant progress, especially in
developing the mis­sile's accuracy. Bora is a road-mobile missile that
carries a 480 kg high-explosive war­head, has an operational range of
around 280 km and is reported to have a CEP (cir­cular error probable) of
50 meters. Notably, ROKETSAN, the primary manufacturer of the weapon
system, claims Bora's CEP is as small as 10 meters or even less. If
true, this would make the missile one of the most precise in its class.

Bora saw its combat debut in May 2019 during Operation Claw in Northern
Iraq. Its maiden operational launch was widely publicized in the Turkish
press, showcasing yet another milestone for Turkey's burgeon­ing defense
industries. After all, a road-mobile (enables better survivability on
the battleground), solid-fuel (minimizes the launch-cycle, supporting
launch at short notice) tactical ballistic missile, carrying half a ton
of high-explosive warhead with precision strike capability within 280
kilometers represents a game-changer for Turkish military operations.
Now, Ankara must walk a fine line in missile proliferation, as Turkey is
a party to the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR, a non-binding
yet effective exports control regime focusing on systems able to deliver
at least 500 kg payload to 300 km and beyond). The Bora line's further
roadmap remains a critical issue. In this matter, only limited
open-source input is available. In 2018, the Turkish defense minister
spoke of a second batch, Bora 2, without detailing the admin­istration's
plans for areas of improvement. Notably, back in 2012, the Turkish press
reported that then Prime Minister Erdoğan had set the bar high for the
country's national research and development efforts and had called on
the industry to produce missiles with a range of around 2,500 km,
probably with the Middle Eastern military strategic balance in mind.

Technically, [unless Ankara opts for adding **another stage** to
Bora]{.underline}, which would mark a burdensome difficulty in terms of
know-how and defense economics, [it would be safe to assume]{.underline}
that the [Bora family]{.underline} will [remain]{.underline} a
[short-range system]{.underline} (meaning an operational range of less
than 1,000 km). In comparison, Iran's Sejjil 2 solid-fuel bal­listic
missile, for example, has a two-stage design (independent rocket stages
with engine and propellant), setting its operational range at around
2,000 km which places it in the medium-range ballistic missile category
(operational range between 1,000 km and 3,000 km). An educated guess
suggests that [Turkey would focus on minimizing]{.underline} the
[**launch-cycle** and **boosting**]{.underline} their [precision and
maneuverability]{.underline} (new gen­eration ballistic missiles, such as
the Rus­sian SS‑26 Iskander, can follow unpredictable trajectories and
homing maneuvers to strengthen missile defense). Another area of
improvement might be to reduce the radar cross-section of Bora by
altering its design to prevent it being easily detected by early warning
systems. Although such [**modernization** packages]{.underline} might
[furnish]{.underline} the [Turkish Armed Forces with]{.underline} an
[even more lethal **battlefield asset**]{.underline}, [it would not hint
at]{.underline} a [program to produce delivery means for **nuclear
payloads**]{.underline}, [as there is no visible work on nuclear warhead
design]{.underline}, [no hint]{.underline} that the [Bora line will be
adjusted for **WMD delivery**]{.underline} and, so far, [no effort to
**develop** an airburst mode **warhead detonation**]{.underline} during
the tests (airburst above ground level is pre­ferred in ballistic
missiles used in WMD dissemination).

In fact, [considering]{.underline} the anti-access/area denial
(**[A2/AD]{.underline}**) [zones surrounding Turkey]{.underline}, which
pose an immense threat to manned aircraft, [Ankara's decision to invest
in **high-precision** ballistic missile capabilities for
**conventional** roles]{.underline}, coupled with unmanned aerial
platforms with higher payloads, [makes **perfect sense**]{.underline}.

#### Conventional modernization now

[Turkey's roadmap for]{.underline} **[defense

pursue]{.underline} further [**progress** on]{.underline} items that
have been in the limelight, such as [unmanned systems]{.underline},

the biggest unknown, revolving around the F-35 issue, Russia's charm
offensives and the national combat aircraft project (Milli Muharip Uçak
-- MMU). The [ballistic missile program will]{.underline} likely [be
limited]{.underline} to the short range (\< 1,000 km) in the foreseeable
future, [focusing on producing tactical **assets** for battlefield
use]{.underline}. **[Turkey]{.underline}** can further
[advance]{.underline} its [GEZGIN **cruise missile**
project]{.underline} and [reach]{.underline} a range of [beyond 1,000
km]{.underline}. However, the [**GEZGIN** project is designed to develop
conventional]{.underline} **[long-range]{.underline}** strike
[capabilities for **naval platforms**]{.underline}, mimicking the US
Tomahawk and Russian Kalibr missiles.

### U\-\--AT: Erdogan Rhetoric

#### Erdogan uses [nuclear rhetoric]{.underline} to signal regional ambitions which [proves]{.underline} the direction of the internal link. 

Kushal **Agrawal 22,** Research Assistant at Indian Pugwash Society,
"Erdogan's Nuclear Rhetoric", IDSA,6-1-2022,
https://www.idsa.in/issuebrief/erdogan-nuclear-rhetoric-kagrawal-010622//SJ

[Erdogan's **Geo-political Ambitions**]{.underline}

[Turkey]{.underline} under Erdogan [has been pushing for]{.underline} an
[aggressive **power projection** that is not]{.underline} just [limited
to its neighborhood]{.underline}. Turkey's threat perception and the use
of military force was limited till the 2010s as their primary threat was
the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) insurgency, a conflict brewing for
more than four decades. The Turkish establishment's approach towards the
PKK militancy outside of Turkey was defensive in nature but post the
2015 breakdown of the negotiations with the PKK, Turkey has been going
on an offensive with strikes in Iraqi Kurdistan and involvement in
Syria.13 Being part of the NATO bloc helped Turkey allay its fears
against Moscow and other regional powers.

With the rise of an Islamist Erdogan and the fall of the old Kemalist
order, [Turkey's regional ambitions began to rise with]{.underline} the
state's [involvement in **regional conflicts** like **Syria** and
**Libya**]{.underline}. As Erdogan's involvement in the region
increases, [any **rhetoric** about build-up in terms of]{.underline}
armaments, whether [nuclear]{.underline} or otherwise, only [helps him
in sending a **strong message** to its neighbors]{.underline}.

Also, Erdogan has been highlighting Turkey as the leader of the Muslim
Ummah and the one who stands up in defense of every Islamic cause. Since
the Saudis are increasingly seen to be very passive on the issues of
Israel--Palestine, Pakistan--India and many other such emotive Islamic
causes, its leadership role of the predominantly Sunni Islamic countries
has been dwindling. This has created a vacuum that Erdogan is trying to
fill by raising his pitch for the leadership of the Islamic Ummah.

In the September 2019 UN General Assembly speech where Erdogan spoke
about nuclear discrimination, he incessantly spoke at length about the
problems the Muslim world is facing. Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the
only nuclear armed state in the entire Muslim world also raises such
issues time and again but is seen as a body politic ridden with
political instability, internal insurgencies, and a state which is
beholden to the Arabs for support on various issues, especially on its
economy.

Turkey on the other hand is a large economic and a major military power
in the Islamic world. It also has a rich Islamic historical past,
perhaps the longest running Caliphate in the history of Islam and is now
repositioning itself as a big power in the whole of West Asia and North
Africa region. By painting Turkey as a victim of nuclear discrimination
and raising the rhetoric for it on international platforms, Erdogan
hopes to garner popularity within the West Asia and North Africa (WANA)
region and also in the larger Islamic world.

Although Turkey hosts NATO nuclear weapons at its Incirlik Air base, the
Western powers have always had a passive response towards Turkey's
external and internal threat perceptions. Whether in Syria or the PKK or
on Greco-Turkish maritime disputes, the West has largely been on the
opposite side of Turkey's interests.14 The European Union has also
repeatedly shown its disinterest in including Turkey in the grouping.15
This 'blaming the West' helps Erdogan domestically and in the larger
Muslim world. Using the nuclear rhetoric, especially at the backdrop of
raising Islamic issues whether at home or abroad, further buttresses
Erdogan's popularity. After his September 2019 UN speech, Erdogan got a
lot of appreciation from countries like Pakistan, which are hotbeds of
Islamic fundamentalism.16

Nuclear Messaging

US--Turkey relations have been dwindling, especially since the July 2016
unsuccessful coup allegedly by Islamic Preacher Fetullah Gulen who
Turkey declared a terrorist and resident in the US. Turkey has since
developed closer defense and security ties with Russia and China. It
acquired the Russian S-400 air defense system after which the US
administration formally excluded Turkey from the F-35 program and
cancelled deliveries of the fighter jet. Turkey has since been
sanctioned by the US under Countering America's Adversaries Through
Sanctions Act (CAATSA) in December 2020.17

US and Turkey have also had diverging interests in the Mediterranean
Region. With the ongoing Greco-Turkish maritime dispute in the Eastern
Mediterranean waters, Turkey has been critical of the Eastern
Mediterranean Gas Forum, officially formed in September 2020 by Greece,
Israel, Italy, Greek Cypriot administration, Palestinian National
Authority, Jordan and Egypt with the US and the European Union as
Permanent Observers. This was seen by Turkey as a snub on its energy
rights over the Eastern Mediterranean waters.

The Biden administration recognized the Armenian Medz Yeghern (genocide)
just months after the Nagorno-Karabakh war, in which Azerbaijan defeated
Armenia with the help of Turkey.18 With this growing bitterness in ties,
Erdogan through his nuclearization rhetoric may want to send a message
that just because Turkey is protected by NATO's nuclear umbrella, it
will not be a subservient partner to the West.

The nuclear rhetoric is not necessarily aimed at the West but should
also be seen as indirectly conveying a message to Russia. The Turkish
establishment has been moving towards strategic autonomy, as it has
diverging interests with both the Western world and Russia. Russia's and
Turkey's position on Syria are antithetical to each other. Also, amidst
the whole Russia--Ukraine ongoing conflict, Turkey has been one of the
most reliable defence partners of Kyiv, which has angered Moscow.19

This [muscle flexing]{.underline} also [helps Erdogan
**domestically**]{.underline} at a time [when his economic handling has
come under **criticism**]{.underline}. Any such bravado abroad helps
Erdogan boost his image in the domestic constituency and to pivot away
from problems back home. As issues on the economic and political front
escalate, there is a high chance that Erdogan might increasingly indulge
in such a rhetoric more so before the 2023 Turkish general elections.

Conclusion

[Erdogan's statements on **nuclear weapons**]{.underline} could be
nothing more than his efforts to showcase Turkey as a major power in the
Islamic world. Despite such rhetoric, though, [Turkey is **more
isolated** regionally now]{.underline}. [Turkey]{.underline} has
[strained]{.underline} [relations with]{.underline} the [US and
Europe]{.underline}. [Erdogan]{.underline} in recent times, though, [has
given indications of **reconciliation** with Israel]{.underline}.
[Russia]{.underline} has emerged as its main partner for air defence
needs as well as for its civil nuclear energy programmes. Erdogan has
had to dial down on the Ummah rhetoric internationally. [With US
shifting its focus]{.underline} to China, [**Turkey may want to flex its
muscle** in]{.underline} the [region]{.underline} and such [**nuclear
rhetoric** can be useful in signalling Turkey's **regional
intentions**]{.underline}. It [remains to be seen how Erdogan manages
Turkey's **conflicting relationships**]{.underline}, regionally, as well
as with NATO and Russia, [in pursuit of his country's **geo-political
ambitions**]{.underline}.

7\. [Shifting global dynamics due to]{.underline} **[strategic
competition]{.underline}**

Despite its NATO membership, Turkey is hedging its bets and diversifying
its partners, to include growing cooperation with Russia. As strategic
competition between the United States (and by extension, NATO) and
Russia and China heats up, it is unclear how long Turkey's strategy can
last. Russia is not a feasible or desirable replacement for NATO and the
U.S. nuclear guarantee, but so far Turkey is in effect taking steps that
make practical elements of its NATO partnership untenable and a danger
to the alliance. If Turkey concludes that its strategic interests and
vision no longer align with the United States and NATO, but it has few
other alternatives, that could serve as a powerful driver for
consideration of a nuclear weapons program. [Competition
**dynamics**]{.underline} could [influence **Turkish choices**
in]{.underline} the [civil nuclear arena]{.underline} as well. Much like
Turkey's take on the S-400 purchase---and similar to Saudi Arabia's
approach to selecting its nuclear power supplier---the 123
renegotiations with the United States could quickly become subsumed
under geopolitics. [Erdogan]{.underline} no doubt
[understands]{.underline} that the [United States increasingly
views]{.underline} its [civil nuclear energy through]{.underline} the
**[lens of strategic competition]{.underline}**, and such [negotiation
would be an **opportunity** to signal and **exercise** Turkey's strategy
of decreasing]{.underline} its [**reliance** on the United
States]{.underline}.

WHAT TO WATCH FOR

The future of Turkey's civil nuclear energy program. Turkey seems poised
to finally get its nuclear energy program off the ground.128 Turkey has
no current need for enrichment or reprocessing capabilities. Thus, it
will be telling whether Turkey protests any U.S. asks that Turkey commit
not to engage in such activities during renegotiation of the U.S.-Turkey
123 agreement (which expires in 2023), and if so, what justification it
provides.129

Iran's nuclear status. If Iran leaves the NPT, produces nuclear weapons,
or is believed to be close to having them, this would likely lead Turkey
to consider whether it too needs to begin a nuclear weapons program.

[Additional **investment** in domestic **defense capabilities** and
diversification of defense **partners**]{.underline}. [Increasing
longstanding Turkish investment]{.underline} its own defense industrial
base---[including]{.underline} its [missile program or nascent
satellite]{.underline} launch and space efforts---[could serve
to]{.underline} both [reduce]{.underline} its [**reliance**
on]{.underline} the [**U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} and NATO [and
contribute to advancing]{.underline} a [potential **nuclear weapons**
delivery capability]{.underline} (which might be an indicator [Turkey

How does one stop sheltered pursuers? [Major powers]{.underline} make a
decision to [extend shelter]{.underline}, pricing in the [tolerance
of]{.underline} the [pursuer's **nuclear weapons program**
to]{.underline} the [cost of]{.underline} their [**broader**
geopolitical goals.]{.underline} A [smart sheltered
pursuer]{.underline}---and nuclear aspirants are usually quite
smart---[will attempt to exploit]{.underline} the [shelter to
**weaponize**]{.underline} its [nuclear capabilities as quickly
as]{.underline} possible, [before]{.underline} the [shelter]{.underline}
potentially [disappears]{.underline}. Short of convincing a sheltered
pursuer that they do not want or need nuclear weapons after all, the
only way to stop sheltered pursuers is to eliminate their shelter from
sanctions or military attempts at prevention. In some cases, shelter
might evaporate because the patron state independently decides that the
nuclear aspirant they are sheltering is no longer worth the hassle or
that the price of their future entry into the nuclear club is too steep
to bear. This is what Pakistan feared when it benefited from U.S.
shelter to develop nuclear weapons in the 1980s. Islamabad understood
that U.S. forbearance depended on the continuation of the war in
Afghanistan. Without the war, the United States would have had less need
for Pakistan and therefore less willingness to protect their nuclear
program. It is in fact plausible that Pakistan played a double game with
the United States and attempted to prolong the Afghanistan war in order
to extend the shelter and largesse it was receiving from Washington for
as long as possible. The United States was a willing participant in this
game, however. This was a strategic---and not an inevitable---choice,
one the United States could have reversed at any time.

If shelter does not evaporate on its own, other major powers might
engage the patron state (rather than the nuclear aspirant) to convince
them to stop protecting the proliferator. This is the strategy the
United States attempted with China over North Korea's nuclear program
during the Six Party Talks---seeking to get Beijing's buy-in on stopping
North Korean proliferation. China was fundamentally unpersuaded and
continued to shield Pyongyang and issue denials about its progress while
simultaneously appearing to support---but slow-roll---diplomacy and
effective sanctions. There are no cases where a third party has
successfully coerced or cajoled a patron state to stop protecting a
"sheltered pursuer," but driving a wedge between the nuclear pursuer and
its patron if no wedge appears naturally remains the only logical option
to reverse a sheltered pursuit strategy. If that can be achieved, the
erstwhile sheltered pursuer would be exposed in two ways. First, the
existence of a nuclear program would now be implausibly deniable and,
second, the proliferator could now be vulnerable to economic or military
coercion. But the difficulty of peeling off another major power's
shelter for a proliferator should not be understated, as it would be no
easy task, and likely priced in by the shelter prior to extending
protection to the proliferator. [Major powers have]{.underline}---both
under the bipolar Cold War configuration and
after---[decided]{.underline} that nuclear [proliferation is
**tolerable** in pursuit of other **geopolitical
priorities**]{.underline}. [It is likely to occur again]{.underline} and
[identifying where it might be]{.underline} possible [provides
**insight** into]{.underline} the [future nuclear
**landscape**]{.underline}, [as a **sheltered pursuit**
strategy]{.underline}---if it can be selected---[has a **high
probability** of leading to]{.underline} a [nuclear weapons
capability]{.underline}. As such, states like Saudi Arabia and
**[Turkey]{.underline}** (American frenemies) [that may be able to
select]{.underline} this [strategy have a **high likelihood** of
becoming independent nuclear states if they ever **choose to** do
so]{.underline}.

to pursue]{.underline} its own [**indigenous** nuclear

Turkey is a signatory to all major IAEA protocols, and its contract with
Rosatom, the Russian state nuclear agency, for the nuclear plant at
Akkuyu is "proliferation resistant," according to experts. Rosatom
having effective control over Turkey's nuclear reactor reduces the
likelihood that Turkey could attain a nuclear weapon, but [Turkish
**engineers**]{.underline} working in the Akkuyu plant [can gain
**valuable knowledge** which they could]{.underline} then [apply to a

Turkey's best interest to continue abiding by its agreements and that
Erdogan's words are just bluster designed to play into the prevailing
domestic anti-Western mood.

There is a [history of states **violating IAEA**
agreements]{.underline}, [though]{.underline} the [mechanism to punish
noncompliance can]{.underline} easily [be subverted]{.underline}.
Consider the following scenario: The [IAEA]{.underline} is notified by
its inspectors that Turkey is violating its safeguards agreements.
[Having **no authority** to punish]{.underline} this

[Turkey and **Nuclear Prolif**eration]{.underline}

Finally, another category of [anxieties stemming from]{.underline} the
introduction of [**nuclear power** in Turkey relates to]{.underline} the
[military **uses of the atom**]{.underline}. [As nuclear military
technology **proliferated**]{.underline} in the Indian subcontinent [and
concerns grew about]{.underline} the [Iranian nuclear development
program and]{.underline} the [**possibility** of proliferation in the
**Middle East**]{.underline}, [Turkey was among]{.underline} the
[countries that were **rumored** to have an **interest** in acquiring
**nuclear** military capabilities]{.underline}, especially if the
international community failed to prevent the acquisition of nuclear
military capabilities by Iran and Saudi Arabia. 23 This raised concerns
across the region.24 What does the Akkuyu NPP mean for the issue of
nuclear proliferation? To begin with, the [Akkuyu NPP comprises four
pressurized water reactors]{.underline} (**[PWRs]{.underline}**)
[supplied by Russia]{.underline}. This choice of vendor has raised
suspicions, due to [Russia's negative image as]{.underline} a state
which is [**lax** about proliferation and]{.underline} a [**sponsor** of
illicit **nuclear trade networks**]{.underline}. Fears of "**[loose
nukes]{.underline}**" [flowing out of]{.underline} the [former Soviet
arsenals into]{.underline} the [hands of **despots** and **terrorists**
during]{.underline} the [1990s were not without
justification]{.underline}. Disaffected scientists did attempt to steal
nuclear materials, even warheads, and sell them to interested buyers,
especially violent non-state actors in the Middle East.25 Unbeknownst to
the leadership in Ankara, Turkey occasionally served as a route for
nuclear smuggling operations. However, the most [**egregious case** of
nuclear trafficking through Turkey]{.underline} did not involve nuclear
materials or weapons of Russian origin; rather, the
[network]{.underline} was [run by]{.underline} the [father
of]{.underline} the **[Pakistani nuclear bomb]{.underline}**, Abdul
Qadeer Khan. 26 The involvement of Istanbul-based companies in Khan's
operations gave rise to speculation that Turkey was the fifth country to
purchase centrifuge technology from the Pakistani scientist.27

[Turkey and Greece]{.underline}, two NATO allies, [nearly
experienced]{.underline} a [**full-fledged** military
conflict]{.underline} in August. Two of their warships collided during a
naval standoff over hydrocarbon exploration in the Eastern
Mediterranean. This follows a similar naval incident in June between
three Turkish vessels and the frigate of another NATO ally, France,
prompting an inquiry that the alliance has been trying to keep under
wraps to prevent further discord among its ranks. Behind these incidents
lies [Turkey's **embrace** of]{.underline} an **[assertive naval
concept]{.underline}**, namely the "blue homeland," that is [poised to
disrupt]{.underline} the [transatlantic alliance]{.underline} in the
years to come.

The "[blue homeland]{.underline}" [is an **irredentist** concept that
claims vast sections of]{.underline} the [**Aegean** and Mediterranean
seas]{.underline}, [including Greek and Cypriot maritime borders and
**hydrocarbon deposits**, for Turkey]{.underline}. What began as a
fringe idea among the anti-Western brass of the Turkish navy has morphed
into a [popular nationalist aspiration]{.underline} fronted by
[President]{.underline} Recep Tayyip [Erdoğan]{.underline}. "Blue
homeland" will continue to damage Ankara's diplomatic relations, since
Erdoğan will find it difficult to step away from maximalist claims he
has personally cultivated.

The [tendency to see]{.underline} the [Turkish president's
**belligerence**]{.underline} merely [as posturing]{.underline} for
domestic consumption, [and failure to develop]{.underline} a concerted
[**transatlantic** strategy]{.underline}, [has provided Erdoğan
with]{.underline} the time and [opportunity to **institutionalize** his
irredentist thinking]{.underline}. **[Absent pushback from the
West]{.underline}**, [Turkish foreign and security policy will reflect
**Erdoğan's worldview** for decades to come]{.underline}. The United
States and the European Union should, in response, work together to
discourage the Turkish president from continuing to play a destabilizing
role in NATO's southeastern flank. They should also engage and support
Turkey's pro-Western dissidents and help amplify their voices in a media
landscape almost entirely dominated by Erdoğan. Coordinating a Western
response --- while extremely difficult --- is essential to mitigating
the most damaging effects of current Turkish foreign policy.

Background to 'Blue Homeland'

The "blue homeland" naval concept, first coined in 2006, does not stem
from Erdoğan's Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party. Instead,
as Ryan Gingeras lays out in detail in his War on the Rocks piece, its
origins lie with two staunchly secularist naval officers who later
developed links with the Maoist-rooted neo-nationalist Homeland Party.
The party and its predecessor, the Workers' Party, were once fierce
opponents of Erdoğan and his political party. However, the Homeland
Party has since entered into a tactical alliance with the Justice and
Development Party as the Turkish president gradually turned to his
former adversaries among the ultranationalists and Eurasianists (a
faction that advocates Turkey joining the Russia- and China-led
anti-Western geopolitical camp) in a bid to hold onto power.

Cem Gürdeniz, a retired Turkish rear admiral who is one of the
architects of the "blue homeland," presents the concept as a response to
an existential threat, and offers it as guaranteeing the ability to
"sleep comfortably at home." Gürdeniz sees the Ottoman failure to
control the seas as the cause of the empire's demise and warns that
naval supremacy is crucial for the survival of the Turkish Republic,
which in his opinion continues to remain in the crosshairs of Western
imperialism. While the "blue homeland" is most immediately linked to
maximalist [Turkish claims]{.underline} in areas where Cyprus and Greece
assert jurisdiction, Gürdeniz ultimately [argues]{.underline} that [it
is]{.underline} also [key for Turkey's expansion of its **political**
and **economic influence**]{.underline} across the region. Since he
believes that "the Mediterranean is not sufficient for an expanding
Turkey," [he urges Ankara to take control of]{.underline} the
"[**Persian Gulf**, Sea of Oman, **Arabian Sea**, Red Sea, the Eastern
waters of the Atlantic Ocean, \[and\] **North Africa**]{.underline}."
Within the Eurasianist paradigm, the "blue homeland" is part of a
broader strategy of confronting the West and establishing Turkish
supremacy in the region.

For Erdoğan, this concept is also a means to expand Islamist influence.
More specifically, [he hopes]{.underline} that [Turkish **domination**
of]{.underline} the [**Eastern Mediterranean** will boost Turkey's
military]{.underline} and proxy [presence in **Libya**, **Syria**,
**Iraq**]{.underline}, and beyond, and thereby [strengthen]{.underline}
the [footprint of the Muslim Brotherhood]{.underline} and its agenda.

In October 2019, [there were reports]{.underline} that [Turkey's
President]{.underline} Recep Tayyip [Erdogan expressed]{.underline} his
**[dissatisfaction]{.underline}** that [it was unfair on the West's side
to keep Turkey away from developing **nuclear bomb**]{.underline}.

Turkey though is under the nuclear umbrella of the United States- that
is the United States hosts its tactical nuclear weapon (TNW) in Turkey,
[there is little doubt]{.underline} that [Turkey would be **more than
happy** to have its own nuclear weapons under its own command and
control channels]{.underline}.

This would mean, not just tactical, but [Turkey could have **strategic
nuclear weapons**]{.underline} too [on]{.underline} its territory [as a
**deterrent** against adversaries]{.underline} in the region.

[Turkey is]{.underline} already [developing long range ballistic
missiles that are nuclear capable]{.underline}.

Post failed coup in Turkey, Erdogan has become more and more suspicious
of the United States as he believes that the United States was behind
the coup.

Also, Turkey lacks an effective deterrence against Iran, Saudi Arabia
and Israel.

Moreover, US TNWs, the B-61 nuclear gravity bombs are maintained in
Incirlik base maintained by the United States and given Turkey's
decision to go ahead with the Russian S-400 air and missile defence
system instead of a NATO compatible air and missile defence system, the
question can clearly be raised about the future presence of this force.

Turkey however, is a party to the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty
(NPT), and any attempt to develop nuclear weapons can lead to
international sanctions against Turkey.

[Turkey]{.underline} has already [proceeded with **nuclear cooperation**
on]{.underline} nuclear [energy with Russia]{.underline}, but [there is
**no specification** unlike in]{.underline} the [Iranian nuclear
cooperation with Russia]{.underline}, [where **spent fuel** will be
sent]{.underline} from Iran [to Russia]{.underline}, as to whether
Turkey would need to do the same. But in all likelihood, Russia would
demand an agreement that would require Turkey to send its spent fuel.

However, there are assumptions that [Turkey]{.underline} in future
[could acquire **nuclear weapons** from **Pakistan**]{.underline}.
[**Pakistan is not a party** to the NPT]{.underline}. Moreover, Turkey
has also stated that the NPT is unfair and hence, in future
[if]{.underline} the [**NPT** became a **hindrance** for Turkey to
acquire nuclear weapons]{.underline} there could be a possibility of
[Turkey **not continuing** as member of NPT]{.underline}.

In February 2020, Turkey and Pakistan joined hands to bolster defence
ties.

According to reports, Pakistan has a tie up with Saudi Arabia that when
need arises, Pakistan would provide nuclear weapons to Saudi Arabia
owing to the fact that Saudi Arabia had funded Pakistan's nuclear
program. Hence, there is [**little scope** to believe]{.underline} that
[Pakistan would not indulge in]{.underline} a similar [arrangement with
Turkey to provide nuclear weapons]{.underline}.

According to a Jerusalem Post quote, "in the 2000s, Turkey was a covert
industrial hub for the nuclear black market of rogue Pakistani scientist
Abdul Qadeer Khan. Khan's network offered buyers a menu of both
technical expertise and the materials to make a bomb. The electronics
parts of the centrifuges, the most important items in this covert trade,
were from Turkey."

Hence, [**nuclear links** between Pakistan and Turkey have **long
existed**]{.underline}.

The question then is would Turkey utilize the nuclear technology of
Pakistan?

Pakistan has invited Turkey to invest in its energy sectors and also
participate in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Last year,
Erdogan has also helped Pakistan escape a huge penalty in a litigation
involving a Turkish power company, Karkey Karadeniz Elektrik Uretim that
involved \$1.2 billion imposed by the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Dispute. In 2019, Pakistan-Iran-Turkey also
signed the International Road Transport agreement to create a trade-
corridor. Thus growing cooperation between Pakistan and Turkey is
clearly visible.

Even if Turkey does not acquire entire weapon system, [it could acquire
**know how** to develop nuclear weapons from Pakistan]{.underline}.

In fact, if Iran-Turkey relations improve considerably, Pakistan could
also have a joint cooperation mechanism to train Iranian and Turkish
scientists on nuclear weapon technology.

[Turkey already **possesses**]{.underline} nuclear
[reactors]{.underline} and hence, [they could gain nuclear **expertise**
to pursue]{.underline} nuclear [weapons development program
in]{.underline} their [**own country** than getting it from Pakistan to
avoid]{.underline} any **[proliferation accusations]{.underline}**
against itself.

### Prolif\-\--Impact\-\--AT: Motive

#### Motive

Hakan **Mehmetcik 18.** Associate professor at the Department of
International Relations at Marmara University, PhD in political science
and international relations from Yildiz Technical University, "Nuclear
Latency: The Turkish Case", Asian Journal of Peacebuilding, November
2018, Vol. 6. Issue 2. p. 246-265//SJ

[**Security** Related Motivations]{.underline}

Regional Dynamics: [Proliferation]{.underline} literature [sees security
related motivations as **important drivers** of nuclear weapon
**acquisition**]{.underline}. [When it comes to
**latency**]{.underline}, as a technological hedging option, [regional
dynamics provide **significant motivations** for Turkey]{.underline}.
Iran, and its long running nuclear program, in particular is highly
salient for Turkey. There are number of studies that foresee Turkish
nuclear proliferation in the case of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon
(Güney 2012). Although Iran's nuclear program has been temporarily
stopped by the agreement between the P5+1 and Iran, known as The Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran's advancing nuclear
infrastructure still remains a potential trigger for a regional
proliferation chain where other countries opt for similar capabilities
(McFall 2017). Currently, Iran is the only country that is very close to
being labeled as a latent nuclear power in the region. Saudi Arabia
comes first among those who cannot afford the [threat of]{.underline} a
[regional rival armed with]{.underline} (**[virtual]{.underline}**)
[nuclear weapons]{.underline}. [Turkey is]{.underline} also [one of the
**aforementioned** candidates for nuclear weapons within]{.underline}
the [nuclear community of experts]{.underline}. However, Turkey and Iran
have managed to keep differences at the sub-strategic level by retaining
deepening economic ties and opening state-to-state channels even though
there are serious conflictual rivalry patterns, especially in Syria
(Stein 2015). That has not changed in the current environment even
though there are a number of geopolitical rivalries among them and even
beyond. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance shapes
Ankara's approach to security including the Iranian nuclear threat.
Given the current diminishing level of trust between the United States
and NATO, [Turkey would be between]{.underline} a [rock and a hard place
in making]{.underline} the [decision on nuclear latency]{.underline}, if
not going for the full nuclear option. [Given]{.underline} the low [ebbs
with]{.underline} the United States and other **[NATO]{.underline}**
allies, that [possibility is indeed on the horizon]{.underline}.

Besides the Iran issue, [Turkey]{.underline} also [has a number of **hot
spots** and increasing **security risks** and volatilities
in]{.underline} its [immediate **periphery**]{.underline}. [External
threats to Turkey]{.underline}, for a long time, have stemmed from
non-state violent arms groups and terror networks. Ongoing PKK
(Kurdistan Worker's Party) terrorism and a proto-Kurdish state which has
emerged out of the chaos in neighboring countries are an existential
threat to Turkey. Yet these types of threats do not require a nuclear
deterrent as Turkey's advanced conventional capacities are potent
enough. Indeed, since the end of the Cold War, [Turkey]{.underline} has
[increased]{.underline} its [development]{.underline} and procurement
[of advanced precision strike capabilities]{.underline}, many of which
are homegrown. However, [increasing threats on]{.underline} the
[**menacing** southern and eastern borders may force **Turkey** to
take]{.underline} an [**alternative decision** in the
long-term]{.underline}. This is especially true when it comes to the
increasing missile threat. Turkey first became truly concerned with the
proliferation of ballistic missiles during the Iraq-Iran War in 1980s.
Currently, all neighbors along the eastern and southern borders are
known to have pursued militarization, acquisition of massive
conventional weapons, proliferation of missiles, and even WMDs. Even
though Israel is the only state that has not signed the NPT, Algeria,
Sudan, and Israel have not signed the Biological Weapons Convention, and
Egypt and Syria have thus far refused to sign the Chemical Weapons
Convention. Iran is pushing ahead with its nuclear and missile programs.
No state in the region is a formal member of the Missile Technology
Control Regime, and many states in the region are known to have pursued
nonconventional weapons in the past (Ulgen 2012). Moreover, not just
states but also [violent **non-state actors** armed with **advanced
weapons** and **missiles** pose]{.underline} a [great danger to
Turkey]{.underline}. Turkey was under constant missile fire from ISIS
for months, and is now under the threat of missiles from PKK/PYD in
Syrian territory (PYD is the Syrian affiliate of the PKK). [This pushes
Turkey towards advancement and domestic **capability building**, which
also increase its **technical latency** in terms of **strategic delivery
systems**]{.underline}.

### Prolif\-\--Impact\-\--AT: Norms

#### Norms go [unenforced]{.underline} behind nuclear cooperation.

Second, our results suggest that [**countries** have]{.underline}
certain [military motivations in engaging in]{.underline} the more
concrete form of [nuclear cooperation]{.underline}: [they can
leverage]{.underline} higher [levels of nuclear cooperation to
**strengthen**]{.underline} their [weak military alliance]{.underline}.
According to our results from Case 3, the supplier and client countries
tend to complement their weak military alliance (such as entente) with
concrete nuclear cooperation. This implies that the exporter countries
seek other newcomer countries with whom they have not shared a defense
pact. In particular, this phenomenon is more evident in Russia, one of
the major export countries. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991, Russia has entered into defense pacts mainly with the former
Soviet Union countries or Eastern European countries (Gibler, 2008).
Thus, the [results imply]{.underline} that [Russia]{.underline}, which
[is currently **expanding**]{.underline} its **[nuclear
exports]{.underline}**, could [use nuclear cooperation as]{.underline}
an [opportunity to expand its **international ties** with more
countries]{.underline}. Turkey, Finland, Bulgaria, and China are such
examples of client countries. [Russia is]{.underline} now [**engaged**
in concrete cooperation with **Turkey**]{.underline}, Finland, and
Bulgaria with whom Russia has only shared an entente pact. In addition,
Russia supplied several cases of concrete nuclear cooperation with China
(although China is not a newcomer country) whom they share only an
entente pact. Moreover, South Korea and UAE is another related example
to support this view. These countries committed nuclear power plant
construction projects in 2009 while not forming any military alliance
(defense or entente). Initiated by this cooperation, however, they are
currently looking to strengthen their economic partnership and deepen
their military cooperation (Rahman, 2021; YONHAP NEWS AGENCY, 2021).
This is in line with our results that [concrete cooperation could be
**leveraged** as strengthening the **military alliance**.]{.underline}

Moreover, this result on military motivations is partly driven by the
fact that some countries with the strongest military alliance (such as
the defense pact) already had gone through concrete cooperation before
2000, thereby low motivation to form concrete nuclear cooperation.
Canada-Argentina and the US-Poland are such examples. These country
pairs formed concrete cooperation before 2000 (Fuhrmann, 2009b), but the
more recent dataset of ours indicates supportive cooperation only.12

In summary, our analysis indicates that [**non-proliferation norms**
have not]{.underline} been strictly [**enforced** in international
nuclear cooperation under **new market dynamics**]{.underline}.
[Specifically]{.underline}, [concrete nuclear cooperation]{.underline}
could [take place if]{.underline} the [same **military interest** is
shared even when]{.underline} the [norm compliance **levels**
of]{.underline} the [client country are low]{.underline}. Moreover,
[military **motivations** may be behind]{.underline} concrete [nuclear
cooperation]{.underline}. [Countries with **high military expenditure**
tend]{.underline} to [receive]{.underline} a [more concrete]{.underline}
form of nuclear [cooperation]{.underline}, and [countries]{.underline}
also seem to [use]{.underline} concrete nuclear [cooperation to
**strengthen**]{.underline} their [military alliance.]{.underline}

### Prolif\-\--Impact\-\--AT: Public Opinion

#### AKP has established [strongholds]{.underline} over public media\-\--'criticism' doesn't [exist]{.underline} in Turkey.

[Victory Is **Defeating**]{.underline} the **[AKP]{.underline}**

The present situation is in fact the story of a paradox inherent within
the AKP's strategy of domination. From its early years, the AKP believed
that the existing personnel in the country's leading institutions did
not share the party's "vision" of government. Hence, in order to rise to
the top and stay there as long as possible, the AKP hollowed out
Turkey's institutions. It did a stunning job, increasingly displaying a
preference for loyalty over merit and filling the country's institutions
with those whose abilities were overshadowed by their devotion to the
party --- to put it mildly.

In addition, Turkey's new and controversial presidential system linked
the country's entire political system to one human being, with two
important consequences. First, when Erdoğan sneezes, the entire country
catches a cold. In other words, [**tying** all important decisions
to]{.underline} the [president leaves]{.underline} the [country at the
mercy of **one individual**]{.underline}. Plus, having surrounded
himself with "yes men," [Erdoğan is **unlikely** to hear]{.underline}
even [**constructive criticism** from]{.underline} his
[minions]{.underline} --- a [dynamic]{.underline} [that only
**perpetuates**]{.underline} the [cycle]{.underline}.

Second, the "personalized" nature of Erdoğan's rule has turned out to be
contagious within the AKP ranks. [Countless **corruption** allegations
and]{.underline} the [AKP's]{.underline} barely [hidden penchant for
**nepotism** paint]{.underline} an interesting, if not necessarily
surprising, [picture]{.underline}: So-called [patronage networks have
taken over]{.underline} most **[institutions]{.underline}**, [ranging
from]{.underline} various [bureaucracies to]{.underline} the [national
Wushu federation]{.underline}. Of course, this observation does not
implicate everyone affiliated with the AKP. Still, the [AKP's
**patronage networks** have become **too visible**]{.underline} and
salient [for anyone to **claim** that they don't exist]{.underline} in
the first place.

The [AKP is being **defeated** by]{.underline} its [own
victory]{.underline}. Over the last two decades, the [party has **proven
itself** to be]{.underline} a [master at **breaking** existing
institutions and **norms**]{.underline}. However, [when it comes to
**building**]{.underline} (or rebuilding) [institutions]{.underline} ---
which is not to be mistaken for building roads and bridges --- the
[AKP]{.underline} has [failed]{.underline}, partially [due its
**overwhelming success** at breaking]{.underline} the very [institutions
it aimed to **control** in]{.underline} the [first place]{.underline}.
Paradoxically, [as]{.underline} the [AKP reaches]{.underline} the [peak
of]{.underline} its **[institutional control]{.underline}**,
[it]{.underline} also [**weakens** as a political actor]{.underline}.
Perhaps the AKP broke Turkey's institutions a little too much.

The West has greater leverage [[The West]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[[has]{.mark} its own [tools to bind Turkey to
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most importantly, **[[the West has a superior
power to reward Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For instance, analysts
often refer to close economic ties between Turkey and Russia, but [the
[EU]{.mark} [is]{.mark} by far [Turkey's largest trading partner]{.mark}
and main source of investments, accounting for 33.4% of Turkey's imports
and 41.3% of its exports in 2020 ([and 21]{.mark} out [of]{.mark} the
[27 EU member]{.mark} states [are]{.mark} also [members of
NATO]{.mark}). [Military relations]{.mark} between Turkey and NATO also
[favour the West]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[NATO's]{.mark} [collective
defense protects Turkey,]{.mark} and [the]{.mark} decades-old
[alliance]{.mark} ties have made [Turkey far more dependent on the West
than]{.mark} on [Russia.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The S-400 system is
expensive, but the delivery to Turkey began only in 2019, and Russia
accounts for only 5% of arms import by Turkey in the last ten years
between 2012 and 2021. During the decade, Russia ranked below other
weapons suppliers of Turkey such as the United States (51%), Italy
(16%), Spain (13%), and South Korea (6%) according to the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute's Arms Transfers Database. For
binding Turkey to NATO and wedging Turkey away from Russia, we recommend
reward-based strategies rather than coercion. Academic literature
suggests that [[positive sanctions work]{.mark} better and that a
coercive approach is chosen by those with weaker reward
power]{.underline}. A coercive strategy can easily antagonize the
target, whereas a reward-based strategy is unlikely to worsen the status
quo. Reward-binding is particularly important in relation to the Turkish
public, who have resented the West's treatment of their country in the
aftermath of the Syrian refugee crisis and the 2016 coup attempt against
Erdoğan. This anti-Western sentiment has been further exacerbated by
pro-government Turkish media. In fact, unlike the seemingly neutral
position of the Turkish government in this Russia-Ukraine war, Turkish
mass media is dominated by anti-Western discourse and criticism against
NATO. A poll in March revealed that 48.3% of Turks blamed the United
States and NATO for the current situation in Ukraine and only 33.7%
thought Russia was responsible. In the same poll, 51.7% of Turks see the
United States as the biggest threat to their country as opposed to
Russia (19.4%). As a Turkish scholar points out, anti-Western sentiments
that developed for years will not easily disappear from the Turkish
public opinion even after Erdoğan's recent U-turn. In international
security and diplomacy, **[[NATO allies have already]{.mark} [begun
taking a conciliatory approach]{.mark} toward Ankara]{.underline}**.
This can be [[seen in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [recent [Franco-Turkish
rapprochement]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [Biden]{.mark} administration's
support for "appropriate U.S. [defense trade ties with Turkey]{.mark}."
**[Economic reward-binding]{.mark} [by NATO allies is likely to be
appreciated by Erdoğan]{.mark}**]{.underline}, who faces the
presidential election in 2023. More importantly, this is a chance for
the West to offer the olive branch to the Turkish public as Turkey
experiences the highest level of inflation in 20 years, with Erdoğan's
economic mismanagement, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the war in Ukraine
creating a perfect storm for the economy. Deepening of the EU-Turkey
customs union and other positive economic incentives are useful tools to
improve media freedom and human rights in Turkey, and the West should
ask for domestic political concessions from Erdoğan. Rather than using
Turkey's political problems as excuses to keep Turkey at distance,
however, economic rewards should be employed to bind the hearts of the
Turkish public to NATO.

[Following **months of diplomacy**]{.underline}, [Turkey and the United

cooperation in areas such as economy and defense.**]{.underline}

"[There is]{.underline} **[a new energy in ties,"
Victoria]{.underline}** Nuland, the US State Department\'s

meeting with Turkish Foreign Ministry and Presidency officials[. The new
mechanism allows Turkish and American officials]{.underline} **[to talk
about all of the issues, from trade to human rights and civil society,
or regional issues from Syria to Ukraine, she added.]{.underline}**

A US-Turkey joint statement on April 4 held out the possibility of a
minister-level meeting later this year. According to diplomatic sources,
this is likely to occur in Washington, marking the first official visit
of Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu since President Joe Biden
took office.

The statement said that Nuland and Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Sedat

However, **[all is not lost]{.underline}**. [The Ukrainian crisis has
increasing questions about the wisdom of Turkey's cozy relationship with
Russia and a **greater appreciation of NATO's value**]{.underline},
[recently reiterated by]{.underline} [two prominent retired Turkish
ambassadors]{.underline}. Interestingly, their reasoning is not that
different than the Turkish diplomats and ministers of foreign affairs
from the 1940s and 1950s who played a central role in negotiating
Turkey's entry into NATO, revealing the continuity that comes with
geography but also the persistent commitment to a Western vocation
dating from Ottoman times. Moving forward, revitalizing Turkey's
traditional Western vocation and its NATO membership will be dependent
on two developments. Erdoğan is failing to address Turkey's mounting
problems. His approval ratings have dropped from almost 56% at the start
of the COVID-19 pandemic to 38.6% at the end of 2021, while the
governing AKP has also steadily lost support and was down to 23.9%.
Under these circumstances, the opposition stands a growing chance of
winning the next elections if they are reasonably free. However, the
opposition led by the social democratic People's Republican Party (CHP)
has remained by and large quiet on foreign policy issues and shied from
advocating pro-Western policies. This would need to change, and the
opposition would need to adopt an informed and rational platform that
dispels prejudices and better explains to the public why revitalizing
stronger relations with the West would benefit Turkey's interests.
**[The West needs to do its part]{.underline}** too. Foremost, [there
needs to be a recognition that there is political change in the offing
in Turkey]{.underline}. It is far from certain but there is a decent
likelihood that the next elections would be won by the opposition. In
the meantime, [it will be important for the U.S. to
recognize]{.underline} that the current crisis over Ukraine has once
more shown **[the strategic value of Turkey to NATO]{.underline}** and
develop, **[together with other allies]{.underline}**, a constructive
narrative that would welcome a post-election Turkey back into the core
of the trans-Atlantic alliance. Given the stalling out of its
enlargement process, the EU is unlikely to be able to play the robust
role it did in reforming Turkish democracy in the 2000s. But just like
70 years ago, Turkey's **[NATO]{.underline}** membership [could become a
conduit for]{.underline} mutually reinforcing [Turkey's Western vocation
and its democracy while benefiting European security]{.underline},
including that of Ukraine.

[Ultimately]{.underline}, however, [fears of a Turkish realignment with
Russia are]{.underline} likely [overblown. Moscow and Ankara's relations
have]{.underline} historically [been fraught, and the recent
rapprochement stems]{.underline} more [from opportunism]{.underline}
[and coinciding interests]{.underline} than a major reorientation in
Turkish foreign policy at the expense of its traditional alliances. In
fact, [Turkey's forceful posturing is making it]{.underline} steadily
[more at odds with Russia in conflict environments]{.underline} where
both operate, including Nagorno-Karabakh, Syria, and Libya. Its growing
involvement in the Caucasus, for instance, has brought it dangerously
close to armed confrontation with NATO's primary contestant, Russia,
which supports Armenia under the Collective Security Treaty Organization
framework. This was highlighted by Russian President Vladimir Putin's
underscoring of Russia's "obligations to Armenia." Though the violence
ended there, Turkey's proxy saber-rattling contributes to increase risks
of accident or miscalculation leading to armed confrontation with Russia
--- something all parties are eager to avoid. With antagonistic security
interests at stake, [Turkey and Russia are ultimately more likely to
balance against rather than align with each other,]{.underline} though
several NATO allies continue to regard Ankara's ties to Moscow with a
deep-seated sense of suspicion. A Constructive Role for NATO [As Turkey
and the E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [ramp up their
rhetorical joust, it is]{.underline} perhaps [no surprise that **NATO is
better placed to act as a forum for the de-escalation of the crisis**.
It is]{.underline} indeed [Turkey's membership to NATO]{.underline}, and
the daily staff-to-staff contacts which it generates, [that makes the
alliance able to work as a platform where]{.underline} their [diplomats
can negotiate, exchange information, and address issues]{.underline} of
common strategic interest with European counterparts, [thus helping to
undermine the "us-versus-them" mentality]{.underline} which at times
prevails across E.U. institutions. [As the latter hardens its rhetoric,
**NATO can generate the much-needed safety valve where diplomatic
efforts have a chance of succeeding.**]{.underline} To this end, [the
alliance should capitalize on the consultative function of its
institutions to allow for parties to sit together, express their views
and concerns]{.underline} on national and collective security
considerations, [and improve mechanisms to reach a
consensus]{.underline} on the means to address any perceived challenges.
[Consultations]{.underline} have indeed always been at the core of the
alliance, and [remain important vectors for addressing intermember
disagreements]{.underline}. The [recent announcement]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} NATO Secretary General Jens [Stoltenberg that
a]{.underline} military [de-confliction mechanism would be established
between Greece and Turkey is]{.underline} but [one example of the
productive results that such diplomatic efforts]{.underline} can [yield,
and an encouraging sign that the two sides are not willing to see their
relations deteriorate further.]{.underline} Yet a limited arrangement
between Greece and Turkey is also unlikely to address the deep-seated
causes of the political turmoil between Ankara and European allies, and
[NATO should find new and improved ways to act as a forum to discuss,
and]{.underline} to [act]{.underline}, where necessary, [on issues
**affecting the security interests of its member states**. This is key
if the organization wants to remain flexible and relevant in the

From a foreign politics perspective, [Turkey envisages]{.underline} its
[mediation]{.underline} efforts [in]{.underline} the [Ukraine-Russia war
as]{.underline} an [opportunity to **boost**]{.underline} its [global
stance]{.underline}. Indeed, with Turkey walking a fine line with the

Turkey as an awkward partner

[Despite the rift between Turkey and the West, Ankara's]{.underline}
Balkan [policy is neither disruptive nor entirely beholden to
neo-imperialist fantasies]{.underline}. [Rather it reflects a mixture of
ideology and pragmatic calculations and is often a **product of
circumstances** rather than grand designs]{.underline}. To start with,
[there is **no evidence** that Erdogan or the AKP are systematically
exporting authoritarian institutions and practices abroad, undermining
the West]{.underline}. Authoritarianism in the Balkans is a home-grown
phenomenon and not an import. In the 1990s, for instance, both Serbia
and Croatia saw the emergence of strongman regimes led respectively by
Slobodan Milošević and Franjo Tudjman. Such regimes combined democratic
and authoritarian elements, e.g. competitive elections in tandem with
state capture skewing the playing field, the propagation of illiberal
ideology and the suppression of minorities. It would be far-fetched to
fault Erdoğan, Putin, Viktor Orbán or anyone else about the rule of law
and accountability deficits in a region with historical experience with
competitive politics but is still a novice when it comes to democratic
governance. External powers may take advantage of state capture and
corruption, as they often do, but these are by and large local
conditions liable to be exploited (Bechev 2017; Bieber and Tzifakis
2019). Foreign meddling could well exacerbate matters -- e.g. Turkey's
partnership with or outright patronage over certain politicians and
factions in Bosnia and Herzegovina consolidates their grip on power and
public resources -- but is not the root cause of democratic
dysfunctionality. Secondly, [Turkey is not always the lone wolf it
appears to be]{.underline}. [A 'neo-Ottoman' policy would imply that
Turkey acts mostly unilaterally instead of through]{.underline}
institutions or alliances such as [NATO]{.underline}. To be sure,
Turkish foreign policy has a strong unilateralist impulse, as many
scholars and experts have pointed out. Self-reliance and distrust of
foreigners are entrenched in the Turkish public's perceptions and
attitudes (Aydın 2019). Ankara has made moves and asserted its interests
in the Balkans, such as providing economic assistance through TİKA),
supporting domestic political players aligned with the AKP, funding
schools, trying to mediate in regional disputes etc. The same was very
much true of the Middle East before the Arab Spring when Davutoğlu was
touting the notion of Turkey as an order-setter (düzen kurucu ülke)
(Davutoğlu 2001). At the same time, [even with President Erdoğan in
complete control and nationalism rampant, foreign policy has **played
along and adapted to multilateral institutions**]{.underline}. To give
the obvious example, despite its strained relationship with NATO and the
EU, Ankara continues to support their enlargement to the Balkans, as in
the AKP's early years of power. Rather than pursue an obstructionist
strategy, as does Russia, and try to wean countries into its diplomatic
orbit, it ratified without delay Montenegro and North Macedonia's NATO
accession treaty. There is no rhetorical or substantive opposition from
Ankara vis-à-vis the EU's expansion (Daily Sabah 2020). That makes sense
from a purely rational perspective. Bringing new members also means
expanded market access for Turkey thanks to the Customs Union with the
EU. Notably, Turkey is amongst the top five export markets for Romania,
Bulgaria and Greece, all members of the Union.7 In short, there still
remains a multilateral dimension to Turkey's engagement with the
Balkans, even if it gets overshadowed by Erdoğan's leader-to-leader
diplomacy (Büyük and Öztürk 2019). To sum up, despite the overarching
trends towards de-Europeanization affecting both Turkey and the Balkans,
there remains institutional ties and economic ties that bind them both
in the Western sphere. [This creates **space for Turkey and Western
actors** to join forces]{.underline} in the region [on an **ad hoc
basis**]{.underline}.

### AT ISIS\-\--High Now

#### **ISIS has already increased power -- recent attacks prove** 

**Al-Hajj 3/15**/22 \[Taim Al-Hajj, Investigative Syrian journalist,

Lowell-ES\]

In January 20, 2022, [insurgents affiliated with the Islamic State
([ISIS]{.mark}]{.underline}), [[attacked Al-Sina
prison]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Ghweiran neighborhood in the city of
al-Hasakah in Syria's far northeast. **[[The attack]{.mark} [sent a
message]{.mark} to many beyond the borders of the small city [that the
org]{.mark}anization [has]{.mark} [significant military, financial, and
media abilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [The raid,]{.underline} one of a
long series of multi-pronged attacks in Syria and its neighboring Iraq,
[highlights ISIS' resolve to model its post-caliphate strategy for
insurgencies]{.underline} that are not necessarily contingent on
territorial control.

Such a departure from the group's basic creed was unimaginable back in
2014 when ISIS was at the height of its power under the leadership of
its forefathers Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Abu Ibrahim al-Qurashi. [A
close reading of the group's recent escalated attacks reveals that ISIS
is using a pattern of tactics that are very similar to the ones they
adopted prior to 2010]{.underline} when they relied on traditional
combat, attrition attacks, and guerrilla wars.

For example, the well-planned, wide-scale attack on the prison, used two
car bombs that detonated at the main gate, allowing several of the
group's fighters to breach it and storm into the prison from several
directions. In a statement on the outcome of the attack, ISIS said they
were able to "free a number of detainees," but the international
coalition backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) denied this and claimed
they had killed 370 prisoners who attempted to escape during the
weeklong clashes. SDF was able to regain full control of the prison on
January 31, 2022.

Regardless, **[[this]{.mark} brazen [attack was a]{.mark} stark
[reminder of ISIS']{.mark} organizational [strength]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} [had]{.mark} [been]{.mark} long
[forgotten]{.mark}]{.underline}** since the fall of the border town of
Baghouz in March 2019 when former American president Donald Trump
announced the collapse of the group's territorial caliphate. Since then,
**[[ISIS]{.mark} and its affiliate militias [have decided to revert to
guerrilla warfare]{.mark} [and working under a unified leadership, which
has shown exceptional malleability, especially in
Syria]{.mark}.]{.underline}** They have been able to efficiently
restructure themselves organizationally at the military, security,
administrative, and media fronts.

NON TERRITORIAL RESURGENCE

The group's resurgence in Syria does not seem particularly territorial.
For ISIS, rural insurgency and desert combat are no less important than
urban warfare as a means to achieve its objectives and ensure its next
return. The group has spared no effort in attacking the Syrian regime's
forces, its allied militias, the Russian troops, the coalition forces,
the SDF forces, and, at times, the Syrian opposition forces.

ISIS realizes that territorial control gives it leverage, but given the
current circumstances, it decided that becoming a covert network was the
better option. Judging by the group's behavior in Libya, Nigeria, West
Africa, Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, and Iraq, where their leadership has long
been headquartered, the Islamic State is executing a low-level
insurgency and keeping a low profile.

A recent report issued by the United States Pentagon indicates [that
ISIS has reshuffled its ranks, so that there is a reemergence of
fighters in Syria, taking advantage of the U.S. withdrawal.]{.underline}
The report also confirms that the organization has strengthened its
armed capabilities in Iraq using, as it seems, a residual wealth that
António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, [estimated at
up to \$300 million]{.underline}.

Guterres said that **[[the]{.mark} current [lull in
ISIS]{.mark}-directed [attacks]{.mark} [may only be temporary]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} [he]{.mark} [expressed]{.mark} acute [concern]{.mark}
[about a]{.mark} possible [growth]{.mark} [in the number of
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Guterres' concerns may be well justified
given the number of operations that have been executed by the group and
announced through its news affiliate Amaq News Agency. According to the
United Nations the estimated number of foreign fighter recruits is
between 24,000 and 30,000, including 10,000 in Syria and Iraq. Analysts
specialized in Jihadist groups believe that defeating the group's
Caliphate dream is not the best way to eradicate it on the ground[. The
fact that ISIS is turning into a non-spatial military body has enabled
it to adapt to its new realities and show viability under adverse
circumstances whilst also consolidating its large geographical
presence.]{.underline}

The group's attacks in Syria and Iraq, the two countries that witnessed
the inception and the death of its Caliphate dream, **[demonstrate its
increased powers]{.underline}**, even if its ability to control
territory has plummeted with the demise of its founding fathers.

### AT ISIS\-\--Dead

#### No threat of ISIS [resurgence]{.underline}. 

Anchal **Vohra 22,** columnist for Foreign Policy and a freelance TV
correspondent and commentator on the Middle East based in Beirut, "ISIS
Can\'t Even Direct Lone-Wolf Attacks Anymore", Foreign Policy,

https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/26/the-islamic-state-cant-even-pull-off-lone-wolf-attacks-anymore///SJ

The [jihadi Islamic State group]{.underline} recently
[called]{.underline} on its [supporters to resume attacks in Europe
while]{.underline} the [West is focused]{.underline} on Russia's
**[Ukraine]{.underline}** invasion. In a speech posted online last week,
Islamic State spokesman Abu Omar al-Muhajir asked supporters to take
advantage of the "crusaders fighting each other" by launching a global
offensive to take revenge for a former Islamic State chief killed during
a raid by U.S. special forces in northwest Syria earlier this year. He
also asked sympathizers in Israel to "arm themselves" against the
Israeli state and claimed that only the return of an Islamic caliphate
could liberate Palestinians.

Since the Islamic State was territorially defeated in 2019, analysts
have been debating whether the group will reemerge as a major threat.
That conversation became urgent in January when the group carried out a
prison break in Hasakah, northeast Syria, to free thousands of its
members. In 2020, the group claimed an average of 45 attacks in Syria
every month. It has also gained strength in Afghanistan and in parts of
Africa over the last few years. At least two recent terrorist attacks in
Israel, in the cities of Beersheba and Hadera, were claimed by Islamic
State sympathizers.

[While it is true]{.underline} that the [Islamic State's ideology has
not evaporated]{.underline}, the [group **no longer** seems capable of
directing]{.underline} even [basic **lone-wolf attacks**]{.underline}.
[Most]{.underline} of the [recent attacks claimed by]{.underline} the
[group were carried out by **individuals** who simply **piggybacked**
on]{.underline} its [jihad without having any **logistical** or
**material support**]{.underline}.

The [Islamic State's resurgence in the West is a
possibility]{.underline}, but [there are **no signs of it** as of
yet]{.underline}. The [Islamic State has **neither**]{.underline} the
[**manpower** nor]{.underline} the **[resources]{.underline}**, [and
above all it has **lost the popularity** it once had to lure disaffected
Europeans to launch massive attacks in the West]{.underline}. "I don't
think the Ukraine war matters much for what happens with IS," said Aron
Lund, a fellow with the Century Foundation. He added that in its latest
message the [group is merely trying "to **sound relevant** and up to
date]{.underline}, latching onto current events."

#### Turkey is [lacking]{.underline} in money, fighters, and ammunition

Jennifer **Holleis 22.** Author at DW, "In Syria and Iraq IS is still
capable, but no global threat", DW, 01-26-2022,
https://www.dw.com/en/in-syria-and-iraq-is-is-still-capable-but-no-global-threat/a-60549917//SJ

[Money, fighters, **ammunition**]{.underline}

According to a 2021 report by the US Treasury Department, [IS finances
have **shrunk** significantly]{.underline}, but not dried up entirely.

\"IS has generated revenue through extortion of local businesses,
kidnapping for ransom, and looting,\" the study says.

Furthermore, a substantial part of their funds stem from international
money services.

\"In addition to revenue generated from its **[illicit financial
activities]{.underline}**, IS also has access to tens of millions of
dollars in cash reserves disbursed across the region,\" the report
states.

While this seems a lot, it is [only a fraction of what]{.underline} the
[jihadist group once had]{.underline}, [and it is certainly **not
enough** to kickstart a **new caliphate** in the region]{.underline}.

The group\'s manpower is also dwindling. The [UN estimates]{.underline}
that [**10,000** of]{.underline} the once [100,000 fighters are still
holding out]{.underline}.

\"I [don\'t think]{.underline} that [IS is now succeeding
in]{.underline} actively recruiting [new members]{.underline}. The
[question is to which extent old members are still
regrouping]{.underline} in the Iraqi and Syrian desert, or whether freed
IS prisoners are re-joining the group,\" Julien Barnes-Dacey, Director
of the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council for
Foreign Relations (ECFR) in Berlin, told DW.

Given that there are no realistic alternatives for many fighters,
including the ones that managed to escape from the prison break, it is
highly likely that they could be willing to re-join IS. However, [this
won\'t bring up numbers to previous levels.]{.underline}

The [group\'s **equipment** is]{.underline} also [far **inferior** to
what it once was]{.underline}.

The most recent attack in al-Hasaka indicates that IS owns arms, but
they consist mostly of light and medium weapons.

\"On the one hand, their weapons were stolen from the Iraqi army\'s
inventory, on the other, IS has deposited numerous weapons in hiding
places, such as dried-up wells in the town Al-Baghouz Fawqani, one of
their biggest strongholds,\" Jassim Mohamad, director of the European
Centre for Counterterrorism and Intelligence Studies in Bonn (ECCIS)
told DW.

### AT Kurds

#### Turkish soldiers are engaging in anti-Kurdish violence

TW: descriptions of beatings/violence

[It is difficult to find a term other than state terror for the actions
of the Turkish forces]{.underline} in their arrest operation in the
village of Xaşkan near the Başkale district of Van. [Turkish soldiers
stormed the village on 20 June, abusing the inhabitants and firing
hundreds of shots into the air. This is one of the few cases where the
brutality of the security forces in rural Kurdish regions]{.underline}
has been documented on video. \"They threatened us with death\" After
the raid, villagers collected some of the bullet casings that had been
fired. So far they have counted 400 of them. Relatives and neighbours of
the arrested Mehmet Emin Atlı told the Mezopotamya news agency (MA)
about the attack. Abdulhamit Atlı stated: \"[Soldiers raided the house
after surrounding the village early in the morning. Atlı\'s wife and
daughter were beaten by the soldiers]{.underline}. We collected 400
cartridge cases in our village. [They threatened to kill
us]{.underline}." \"Beatings with rifle butts, gunshots and insults\"
Atlı reported that he asked the commander of the soldiers to act
according to \"law and order\" and asked, \"What kind of law are you
applying by hitting with rifle butts, shooting and insulting? There is
no army fighting here. Why are you firing so many shots here?\" He
continued, \"At least a thousand bullets were fired here. We have
collected only a part of them. There are laws in Turkey. Can these apply
differently in the West and here? We were insulted in the worst way.
They did this to us even though we had done nothing at all against the
soldiers.\" Daughter pushed off stairs Ayten Atlı, the daughter of the
arrested man, reported that the police stormed their house around six in
the morning. She said: \"I saw hundreds of soldiers in front of our
house. I asked the soldiers why they had come. They explained that they
were going to search the house. When I asked them to show me the search
warrant, they started pushing me. That is why I explained to them that I
had just had an operation. Although I had told them that, they pushed me
off the stairs. After the fall, I could not stand up. Because of that
impact, I have pain and swelling in my lower back.\" \"We are not sure
of our lives\" Atlı reported that the [soldiers kept shouting at her and
shooting into the air for minutes. \"It was such a hopeless situation,
we couldn\'t find a place to flee to]{.underline}. [The whole settlement
was under permanent military control anyway.]{.underline}" Ayten
[Atlı]{.underline}, who [sees the soldiers\' actions as an expression of
**anti-Kurdish racism**]{.underline}**,** said: \"It was so obvious that
[they had not come for an arrest]{.underline}. It was as if [they had
come to take revenge]{.underline}. [They beat me and my mother for
minutes]{.underline}. It was sergeant Mehmet K. who beat us the hardest.
We will file a complaint against this person. [There is clearly racism
here]{.underline}. If they continue to pressure us in this way, we will
have to leave here. Because we are no longer sure of our lives. [We are
very afraid that anything could happen again at any
moment]{.underline}.\" Call for solidarity Ayten Atlı called for
solidarity and protest: \"We have been oppressed for years. We had no
proof before, but now we have some. We were beaten by soldiers in front
of our house. If this beating is not because we are Kurds, then what is
it? We want justice. That\'s why everyone should get involved and stand
by our side.\" Kicked on the ground by soldiers Dilber Atlı, the wife of
the arrested man, told how a soldier kicked her leg and she fell down.
She stated; \"When I fell to the ground, they continued to beat me.
[They hit my husband and tried to put him in the vehicle. They started
shooting because I protested against it]{.underline}. I still have kick
marks and bruises on my leg. [Our children are psychologically
destroyed. We were abused and insulted]{.underline}. How can a soldier
of the state do such a thing? Is there no such thing as law and order
anymore? Is it the job of soldiers to torture people? We do not accept
this situation and will address the necessary authorities. We want those
who committed these atrocities against us to be held accountable before
the law."

### AT Greece-Turkey

#### No Greece War

Forces on High Alert over Crisis with Turkey,\" VOA, 6-1-2022,

accessed 6-25-2022, WMK

[Greece\'s armed forces are on high alert]{.underline} in the Eastern
Aegean Sea as tensions escalate with Turkey. [Officials have been
responding to what they say are mounting provocations by Turkey\'s
leadership.]{.underline}

Senior Greek Defense Ministry sources say the [military intelligence
they have gathered point to the prospect of so-called hybrid
threats]{.underline} that Greece may face from its neighbor Turkey as
the two NATO allies compete for oil and gas drilling rights in contested
parts of the Aegean and Mediterranean seas.

The [points of friction between the two countries are many.]{.underline}

A crisis, the sources say, may also spring from a sudden surge in
refugee flows from Turkey, or from unexpected wildfires in remote
locations or islands in the Aegean Sea that [Turkey wants to see
demilitarized]{.underline}.

Some [security analysts say that while Turkey\'s recent
actions]{.underline} - including the bellicose remarks of its leader -
[are serious]{.underline}, **[an armed conflict is
unlikely]{.underline}**. Retired General Leonidas Tzoumis said [both
countries **stand to lose from a military confrontation**]{.underline},
but he warned that Turkish actions may lead to a miscalculation. That
prospect, he said, requires heightened vigilance by Greece\'s armed
forces.

Tzoumis said [Greece is facing]{.underline} what he calls a **[classic
Turkish game of controlled escalation,]{.underline}** [one of repeated
provocations that can trigger a serious enough incident that would
eventually force Greece to negotiate matters]{.underline} like the
Aegean Sea dispute and territorial rights that Greece has been refusing
to discuss because - the analyst said - it does not want to cede an
inch.

### AT Prolif\-\--Turkey Specific

#### Turkey won't prolif. 

Nonprolif regime, no materials

Hakan **Mehmetcik 18.** Associate professor at the Department of
International Relations at Marmara University, PhD in political science
and international relations from Yildiz Technical University, "Nuclear
Latency: The Turkish Case", Asian Journal of Peacebuilding, November
2018, Vol. 6. Issue 2. p. 246-265//SJ

**[Conclusion]{.underline}**

From a proliferation standpoint, enrichment technologies for reactors
can be applied to nuclear weapon development. That is, [if a country
has]{.underline} the [ability to enrich uranium to **reactor
level**]{.underline} (low-level enrichment) then that country can level
up its uranium stockpile to weapons grade (high-level enrichment) within
a relatively small amount of time, which gives a country latency from a
technical point of view. The key point here is whether the country that
has reprocessing capabilities obeys the rules of the international
nonproliferation regime. Departing from this fact, [Turkey has **not
announced**]{.underline} any [plans to pursue enrichment or
reprocessing]{.underline}; on the contrary, [by]{.underline} the [nature
of its **existing** operation]{.underline} and finance model for its
projected power plants [and by]{.underline} the [nature of its
commitment to]{.underline} the [**nonproliferation**
regime]{.underline}, [it has shown good practices]{.underline}.
[Turkey]{.underline} has reiterated that [uranium
enrichment]{.underline} is a future long-term option should Turkey build
a lot of nuclear power reactors, but [is not currently being
**pursued**]{.underline} (Hibbs 2015). Moreover, [**nuclear fuel**
has]{.underline} always [been available on]{.underline} the
[international market for]{.underline} small and medium sized [nuclear
programs]{.underline}. Indigenous production is not economical unless
there is intent for industrial scale enrichment (Fitzpatrick 2014). In
this sense, there are at least two important points that can be drawn
from the assessments given in this article: (1) [Turkey will not have
industrial-scale **enrichment** or **reprocessing**]{.underline}
capabilities in the short- or mediumterm; and (2) as long as Turkey
remains a well-behaved member of the nonproliferation community and
takes care to protect its clear record, [suspicion of "**bad
intentions**" is ill-placed]{.underline}. Such changes are only possible
if Turkey's domestic political and external security environment change
dramatically.

#### Too many factors prevent Turkish prolif.

[Turkey has valid economic arguments for developing]{.underline} the
[capacity to **produce** nuclear energy]{.underline}. Primary [**energy
imports** comprise]{.underline} almost [half of Turkey's]{.underline}
chronic current-account **[deficit]{.underline}**, because the country
imports more than 90% of its oil and natural gas. Moreover, unlike in
Europe, [Turkey's]{.underline} electricity [demand **continues** to
grow]{.underline} at [5-6% per year]{.underline}. Turkish policymakers
see nuclear power as an almost indispensable tool for enhancing energy
security and reducing the import bill.

These [economic]{.underline} interests, [combined with
**national-security** considerations]{.underline}, [give
Turkey]{.underline} an [**incentive** not to seek nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. As a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, Turkey is prohibited from developing military applications of
the technology. If it were perceived to be breaking this commitment,
[other states]{.underline}, including those that would otherwise
contribute to its nuclear energy program, [would turn **against** it and
**jeopardize**]{.underline} its [ability to meet **growing demand** at
an affordable cost]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}, in turn, [would
undermine]{.underline} the **[economic growth]{.underline}** that has
been [central to sustaining]{.underline} the [government's **popular
support**]{.underline} over the past two decades.

Moreover, Turkey is a member of NATO and thus benefits from the security
guarantee that the alliance provides, including its nuclear umbrella.
Indeed, the US has based nuclear weapons in Turkey for decades. More
recently, NATO and the US have deployed ballistic missile defenses in
the country. If the Turkish government sought to acquire its own nuclear
weapons, it would jeopardize these security guarantees and turn NATO
against it.

In any case, [Turkey **lacks**]{.underline} the [**know-how**
and]{.underline} technical [**infrastructure** to produce]{.underline} a
[nuclear weapon **quickly**]{.underline}, and the [country would need
a]{.underline} long time -- probably **[more than a
decade]{.underline}** -- [to develop this capacity]{.underline}. During
this period, [Turkey would face severe political, economic, and security
pressures]{.underline} not only [from]{.underline} the
**[US]{.underline}** and other **[NATO]{.underline}** states, but also
[from Russia, Iran, and others]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, [Turkey's immediate]{.underline} security [threats would be
**exacerbated**]{.underline}. Nuclear weapons would do little to reduce
the dangers posed by Syria's violent disintegration, the rise of the
Islamic State, and the unresolved challenge of Kurdish separatism.
Turkey's [relations with Iran]{.underline}, which heretofore have been
manageable, could [become]{.underline} more [prone to
**crisis**]{.underline}.

All of these considerations point to the serious risks that seeking
nuclear weapons would pose to Turkey's security. These [risks could in
turn exacerbate **internal discord**]{.underline} in the country at a
time when the ruling Justice and Development Party is struggling to
retain popular support.

#### **No Turkey Prolif or inevitable -- tons of alt causes** 

**Eldridge 11** (William G. Eldridge -- United States Air Force
Commander, "The Credibility of America's Extended Nuclear Deterrent The
Case of the Republic of Turkey", Air University Press, September 2011,
<https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/AUPress/Papers/wp_0018_eldridge_extended_nuclear_deterrent.pdf>,
MG)

[Turkey likely will "tip" if Middle East nuclear proliferation becomes
widespread **and** NATO is perceived as ineffective **and** if
US-Turkish relationships collapse. According to one Turkish diplomat,
"**things would have to get really bad**" for Turkey to pursue its own
nuclear weapons. Despite a rocky history, current NATO-Turkish and
US-Turkish relations **remain fundamentally sound**]{.underline}, but
leadership or regional security changes could strain those
relationships. [Factors working against Turkish nuclear weapons
proliferation include the lack of support by **senior Turkish leaders**,
the high value Turkey places on **alliance relationships**, the **lack
of funding** for civilian or military nuclear programs, and Turkish
**treaty agreements** forswearing nuclear weapons]{.underline}.

Despite these proliferation disincentives, Turkey will probably hedge
against falling behind a potential Middle East nuclear energy (or
nuclear arms) race by developing a civilian nuclear power program. As
Iran continues pursuing nuclear enrichment and possibly a nuclear
weapon, Turkey will likely begin to develop a nuclear power program
beyond its current research stage. Turkish leaders do not fear an attack
from Iran, but instead they are concerned with the shift in the regional
balance of power that may result from a nuclear-armed Iran. Hedging with
civilian nuclear power provides scientific and engineering expertise
needed for an aggressive Turkish nuclear program if Iran's regional
influence increases or a broader Middle East nuclear arms race begins.
Therefore, the United States should continue its involvement in Turkey's
emerging civilian nuclear programs utilizing the existing 2008
US-Turkish nuclear cooperation agreement (123 Agreement), develop
additional cooperation agreements that encourage Turkey to forgo nuclear
and spent fuel processing, encourage scientific exchanges, and consider
financially supporting Turkey's civilian nuclear energy program. [The
credibility of US extended nuclear deterrence for Turkey is best
signaled **not** through US nuclear inventory types or numbers, but by
demonstrations of US political, economic, and **security relationships**
with Turkey. Turkey's most important political and security concerns

acquisition.

#### **Turkey isn't going to prolif**

**Ülgen 12** (Sinan Ülgen - visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe in
Brussels where he researches the implications of Turkish foreign policy
for Europe and the United States, "TURKEY AND THE BOMB", The Carnegie
Papers, February 2012,
<https://carnegieendowment.org/files/turkey_bomb.pdf>, MG)

[Turkey has a stellar history of nonproliferation and has signed on to
**every** relevant IAEA and international instrument governing the
spread of nuclear technology.]{.underline} Moreover, it is a member of
NATO and an EU candidate country. [It is **unlikely**,]{.underline}
absent a rupture in relations with its NATO allies, a significant change
in its security environment, or a drastic reevaluation of Ankara's
immediate interests by the civilian leadership, [that Turkey would
consider developing nuclear weapons illicitly.]{.underline}

[A Turkish decision to proliferate would seriously complicate its
international standing, undermine its economic resurgence, and seriously
damage relations with the United States and its other NATO allies.
Moreover, any Turkish move toward weaponization would draw a harsh
rebuke from the United States and would likely be met by an American
proposal to strengthen security guarantees, as well as the threat of
sanctions if Turkey were to continue its weapons efforts. Given Turkey's
nonnuclear history and its long-standing reliance on the NATO security
guarantee, it is **hard to imagine a scenari**o where Turkey would
simply cast aside its policy in favor of an independent weapons
capability.]{.underline}

[Instead of developing its own nuclear weapons capability, Turkey seems
more interested in pursuing robust **conventional** capabilities that
could, in theory, replace some of the missions previously reserved for
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. To do so, Turkey has turned to foreign
suppliers but has also committed to begin designing and manufacturing
hightech weapons domestically. And it will likely continue to increase
its indigenous intelligence, surveillance, and information management
capabilities.26 Turkey's changing military posture is aimed at
countering the threats posed by nonstate actors and bolstering Turkey's
conventional war-fighting capabilities. [Interoperability with NATO
forces remains the key component of Turkey's defense policy and it is
**unlikely** that Ankara would threaten its union with its most
important allies.]{.underline}

#### **No middle east nuclear arms race impact -- assumes literally every scenario**

**Cook 12** (Stephen A. Cook -  Eni Enrico Mattei senior fellow for
Middle East and Africa studies at the Council on Foreign Relations,
"Don't Fear a Nuclear Arms Race in the Middle East", Foreign Policy, 2
April 2012,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/04/02/dont-fear-a-nuclear-arms-race-in-the-middle-east/>,
MG)

[Most important to understanding why the Middle East **will not be a
zone of unrestrained proliferation** is the significant difference
between desiring nukes and the actual capacity to acquire them. Of all
three states that Shavit mentioned, the one on virtually everyone's list
for possible nuclear proliferation in response to Iran is
Turkey.]{.underline} But the Turkish Republic is already under a nuclear
umbrella: Ankara safeguards roughly 90 of the United States' finest B61
gravity bombs at Incirlik airbase, near the city of Adana. These weapons
are there because Turkey is a NATO member, and Washington's extended
deterrence can be expected to at least partially mitigate Turkey's
incentives for proliferation.

But [even if the Turks wanted their own bomb, they have almost **no
capacity** to develop nuclear weapons technology. Indeed, **Turkey**
does not even possess the capability to deliver the 40 B61 bombs at
Incirlik that are allocated to Turkish forces in the event of an
attack,]{.underline} according to a report released by the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace.

[Given the changes in Turkey's foreign policy and its drive for global
influence, it is conceivable that it will want to develop a Turkish
version of France's force de frappe. However, Ankara would literally be
**starting from scratch**: Turkey has no fissile material, cannot mine
or enrich uranium, and does not possess the technology to reprocess
spent fuel, all of which are required for nuclear weapons
development.]{.underline}

This does not mean that Turkey is not interested in nuclear technology.
Yet Ankara's efforts, to the extent that they exist beyond the two
small-scale facilities in Ankara and Kucukcekmece, are directly related
to the country's predicted energy shortfall resulting from the
combination of a booming economy and growing population. The Turkish
government has announced plans for civilian nuclear power to provide a
quarter of Turkey's electricity needs by 2040. But even this
three-decade timeline seems overly optimistic given the inchoate nature
of Turkey's nuclear research.

The Egyptians are way ahead of the Turks in developing nuclear
infrastructure, but [don't expect to see the rise of a nuclear power on
the Nile anytime soon. Egypt's nuclear program is actually older than
India's]{.underline}, and was established only three years after Israel
founded its Atomic Energy Commission. The Egyptian Atomic Energy
Commission, which Gamal Abdel Nasser established in 1955, was
exclusively dedicated to the development of peaceful atomic energy,
though there were suspicions to the contrary. The 1956 nuclear
cooperation agreement with the Soviet Union transferred to Egypt a
2-megawatt light water reactor that only produced small amounts of
plutonium.

There were, of course, worrying signs about the Egyptian program ---
specifically Cairo's refusal to open the Inshas reactor to International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection until after the peace treaty with
Israel. Yet neither President Anwar Sadat nor his successor, the
recently deposed Hosni Mubarak, ever made any effort to develop nuclear
weapons technology. Sadat signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in
1980, and Mubarak negotiated with the United States, France, Canada, and
Germany for reactors and funding for Egypt's nuclear program. Nothing,
however, ever came of these discussions because of the 1986 Chernobyl
disaster --- and the fact that the Egyptians never signed what is known
as the Additional Protocol, which gives the IAEA enhanced powers to
inspect nuclear facilities. Given the trajectory of Egypt's nuclear
development, Cairo's rejection of the Additional Protocol had more to do
with politics and sovereignty than plans for a clandestine weapons
program.

[Even after Mubarak's son Gamal triumphantly declared at the ruling
party's 2006 convention that Egypt was going to ramp up its nuclear
development program, it is hard to believe that Egyptians ever really
took him seriously]{.underline}. Mubarak spent \$160 million on
consultants to tell him where to build 10 planned nuclear power plants,
and selected a location along the Mediterranean for the first one. But
each of the power plants comes with a price tag of \$1.5 billion --- and
this is a country that in the last 15 months has spent approximately
\$26 billion of its \$36 billion foreign currency reserves just to stay
afloat.

[One has to wonder about the pundits' warning of an Egyptian bomb:
**Have they even been to Egypt lately**? If so, they might have a better
grasp of Egypt's **ramshackle infrastructure** and the **dire state of
its economy**, neither of which can support a nuclear
program.]{.underline}

[What about **Saudi Arabia**, then]{.underline}, the Sunni power that is
on the tip of most analysts' tongues when it comes to Shiite Iran
getting the bomb? Saudi Arabia has the cash to make large-scale
investments in nuclear technology. Indeed, the only factor that makes
warnings about Saudi proliferation --- such as that delivered by former
Ambassador the United States Prince Turki al-Faisal last year --- even
remotely credible is the resources the Saudis can muster to buy a
nuclear program. [Yet, while Riyadh can outfit itself with nuclear
facilities with ease, it does **not have the capacity to manage
them**]{.underline}. Mohamed Khilewi, a former Saudi diplomat, claims
that the kingdom has been developing a nuclear arsenal to counter Israel
since the mid-1970s --- but he offers no substantiated evidence to
support these claims.

[In fact, the country has no nuclear facilities and no scientific
infrastructure to support them.]{.underline} It's possible that Saudi
Arabia could import Pakistanis to do the work for them. But while Saudis
feel comfortable with Pakistanis piloting some of their warplanes and
joining their ground forces, [setting up a nuclear program subcontracted
with Pakistani know-how --- or even acquiring a nuclear device directly
from Islamabad --- poses a range of **political risks** for the House
of]{.underline} [Saud]{.underline}. No doubt there would be considerable
international opprobrium. Certainly Washington, which implicitly extends
its nuclear umbrella to Saudi Arabia, would have a jaundiced view of a
nuclear deal between Riyadh and Islamabad. Moreover, it's one thing to
hand the keys to an F-15 over to a foreigner, but letting them run your
nuclear program is another matter altogether.

The concern about Saudi proliferation stems from fears that the kingdom
would be forced to act if both Iran and Israel possessed a nuclear
arsenal. \"We cannot live in a situation where Iran has nuclear weapons
and we don't,\" an unnamed Saudi official declared to the Guardian on
the sidelines of a meeting between Prince Turki al Faisal and NATO
officials in June 2011. \"It's as simple as that. If Iran develops a
nuclear weapon, that will be unacceptable to us and we will have to
follow suit.\"

Yet given the fact that the Saudis have very little nuclear
infrastructure to speak of, this kind of statement is little more than
posturing designed to force the U.S. hand on Iran. Unlike similar
warnings by Israel, which has the capacity to follow through on its
threat to attack Iran's nuclear sites, [Riyadh's rhetoric about
acquiring nuclear weapons is **empty**]{.underline}. What is amazing is
how many people take the Saudis seriously. If Khilewi had been telling
the truth, now would seem like a good time for the Riyadh to give Tehran
a look at what the royal family has been hiding in the palace basement
all these years --- but so far, we have only heard crickets.

Despite its flimsiness, it is hard to ignore the utility of the Middle
East's nuclear dominoes theory. For those who advocate a preventive
military strike on Iran, it provides a sweeping geopolitical rationale
for a dangerous operation. But the evidence doesn't bear this argument
out: If Washington decides it has no other option than an attack, it
should do so because Iran is a threat in its own right, and not because
it belives it will thwart inevitable proliferation in places like
[Turkey, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. It won't, for the simple reason that
there is **no reason** to believe these countries represent a
proliferation risk in the first place.]{.underline}

### AT Prolif\-\--No Impact

#### **No nuke prolif -- too expensive, too difficult, and no one cares**

**Mueller 18** (John Mueller -- senior fellow at the Cato Institute,
"Nuclear Weapons Don't Matter", CATO Institute, 15 October 2018,
<https://www.cato.org/commentary/nuclear-weapons-dont-matter>, MG)

\*edited for ableist language

[HOW ABOUT PROLIFERATION]{.underline} AND TERRORISM?

[Great powers are one thing, some might say, but rogue
states]{.underline} or terrorist groups [are another. If they go
nuclear, it's game over --- which is why any further proliferation must
be prevented by all possible measures, up to and including
war.]{.underline}

[That logic might seem plausible at first, but it **breaks down on close
examination**. Not only has the world already survived the acquisition
of nuclear weapons by some of the]{.underline} \[~~craziest~~\] [mass
murderers in history (Stalin and Mao), but proliferation has **slowed
down** rather than sped up over time. Dozens of technologically
sophisticated countries have considered obtaining nuclear arsenals, but
very few have done so. This is because nuclear weapons turn out to be
**difficult and expensive** to acquire and strategically **provocative
to possess**.]{.underline}

[They have not even proved to enhance status much, as many expected they
would.]{.underline} Pakistan and Russia may garner more attention today
than they would without nukes, but would Japan's prestige be increased
if it became nuclear? Did China's status improve when it went nuclear
--- or when its economy grew? And would anybody really care (or even
notice) if the current British or French nuclear arsenal was doubled or
halved?

[Alarmists have misjudged not only the pace of proliferation but also
its effects. Proliferation is incredibly dangerous and necessary to
prevent, we are told, because going nuclear would supposedly empower
rogue states and lead them to dominate their region. The details of how
this domination would happen are rarely discussed,]{.underline} but the
general idea seems to be that once a country has nuclear weapons, it can
use them to threaten others and get its way, with nonnuclear countries
deferring or paying ransom to the local bully out of fear.

[Except, of course, that in three‐​quarters of a century, the United
States has **never been able to get anything close to that obedience**
from anybody, even when it had a nuclear monopoly.]{.underline} So why
should it be true for, say, Iran or North Korea? [It is far more likely
that a nuclear rogue's threats would cause its rivals to **join together
against the provocateur** ---]{.underline} just as countries around the
Persian Gulf responded to Saddam's invasion of Kuwait by closing ranks
to oppose, rather than acquiescing in, his effort at domination.

#### **Statistical modelling proves no nuke prolif impact**

**Cohen 16** (Michael D. Cohen PhD - convenor of the National Security
College's PhD program and Senior Lecturer at the Crawford School of
Public Policy, "How nuclear proliferation causes conflict: the case for
optimistic pessimism", The Nonproliferation Review, 2016,
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10736700.2016.1256541>, MG)

[University of Pennsylvania's Michael Horowitz conducted a statistical
analysis and found that the probability of new nuclear states
reciprocating disputes quickly increases and then **decreases over
time.**]{.underline}

The probability that a nuclear state will reciprocate a dispute with a
non-nuclear state drops from .53 one year after developing nuclear
weapons to .23 in year 56. Two new nuclear powers are 67 percent more
likely to reciprocate a dispute than two average non-nuclear states. Two
experienced nuclear powers are 65 percent less likely to reciprocate
than two average non-nuclear states. The probability of dispute
reciprocation between an experienced and new nuclear power is 26 percent
greater than two non-nuclear states, and the probability of a very
experienced state and a somewhat experienced state reciprocating is 42
percent less than two non-nuclear states.86

[University of California-San Diego's Erik Gartzke conducted a similar
statistical test when the dependent variable was dispute initiation
rather than reciprocation and found similarly robust results.87 Gartzke
found that, while the overall effect of nuclear proliferation on
conflict propensity is neutral, there is variation in the effect of
proliferation over time. Nuclear proliferation influences the **timing,
rather than the occurrence**, of disputes. While new nuclear states are
prone to initiate militarized disputes, over time they moderate their
policies and become as **likely to initiate disputes as they were before
nuclear proliferation**.88]{.underline} These effects wash out in
statistical tests that do not control for experience with nuclear
weapons. In short, if Iran and North Korea develop nuclear weapons and
challenge their regional status quo, the historical record suggests that
they will not do so for long. Thus James M. Lindsay and Ray Takeyh of
the Council on Foreign Relations recently claimed that a nuclear Iran
would be most dangerous "at first, when it would likely be at its most
reckless." B[ut, "like other nuclear aspirants before them, the
guardians of the theocracy might discover that nuclear bombs are
**simply not good** for diplomatic leverage or strategic
aggrandizement." 89]{.underline}

Conclusion: proliferation pessimism, Iran, and North Korea

[Three of the four mechanisms long alleged to make nuclear proliferation
cause interstate conflict find **little to no empirical support** when
the endogeneity, omitted-variable bias, and conceptual-confusion issues
addressed above are recognized and applied to the evidence.
Preventive-war motivations, nonsurvivable arsenals, and organizational
logics that lead to accidents do not cause armed conflict. The only
mechanism that has systematically led to conflict is conventional
aggression by weak revisionists after nuclear proliferation, but a few
years of experience with nuclear weapons moderates the conflict
propensity of new nuclear states. By failing to specify how frequently
we should observe preventive motivations, their effect on nonsurvivable
arsenals, or how organizational logics lead to conflict, accidents, and
nuclear war, **proliferation pessimist claims are
unfalsifiable**.]{.underline} Pessimist scholars need to specify how
much longer we should observe them not leading to conflict before
concluding that their threat has been greatly exaggerated.

[The undesirability of nuclear use has prevented scholars from coming to
terms with what a more careful and systematic reading of the historical
record suggests about the relationship between these mechanisms and
conflict. Sagan]{.underline} has argued that proliferation fatalism and
deterrence optimism reduce incentives to combat proliferation.90 [But
these same dynamics have led scholars to **vastly exaggerate** the
number of threats posed by the spread of nuclear weapons. If the
greatest danger posed by nuclear proliferation is conventional
aggression in the short-term, scholars need to rediscover how
**deterrence** can moderate the high conflict propensity of new nuclear
states.91]{.underline} Arguments about the frequency of nuclear
escalation, however, say nothing about its cost. Isn't the possibility
of nuclear escalation on the Korean peninsula, for example, evidence
against the arguments made throughout this paper? A few cases of
accidental, unintentional, or deliberate nuclear escalation could show
that the mechanisms offered by pessimist scholars linking nuclear
proliferation and conflict survive the criticisms leveled at them here.
A lower bar for the proliferation-pessimist theory to pass might be one
case of nuclear escalation. [But after seventy years, nuclear weapons
have **not once** led to conflict through the mechanisms addressed
here.]{.underline}

#### **Studies prove nuclear prolif has either no effect on the risk of interstate conflict or reverses it**

**Suzuki 15** (Akisato Suzuki - Adjunct Research Fellow at the School of
Politics and International Relations, University College Dublin, "Is
more better or worse? New empirics on nuclear proliferation and
interstate conflict by Random Forests", Research and Politics, 2015,
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053168015589625>, MG)

[The main findings reveal that the optimist expectation of the
relationship between nuclear proliferation and interstate conflict is
empirically supported:9 first, a larger number of nuclear states on
average **decreases** the systemic propensity for interstate conflict;
and second, there is **no clear evidence** that the emergence of new
nuclear states increases the systemic propensity for interstate
conflict]{.underline}. Gartzke and Jo (2009) argue that [nuclear weapons
themselves have no exogenous effect on the probability of conflict,
because when a state is engaged in or expects to engage in conflict, it
may develop nuclear weapons to keep fighting, or to prepare for, that
conflict.]{.underline} If this selection effect existed, the analysis
should overestimate the conflict-provoking effect of nuclear
proliferation in the above model. Still, the [results indicate that a
larger number of nuclear states are associated with fewer disputes in
the system.]{.underline}

This conclusion, however, raises questions about how to reconcile this
study's findings with those of a recent quantitative dyadic-level study
(Bell and Miller, 2015). [The current paper finds that nuclear
proliferation **decreases** the systemic propensity for interstate
conflict, while Bell and Miller (2015) find that nuclear symmetry has no
significant effect on dyadic conflict, but that nuclear asymmetry is
associated with a higher probability of dyadic conflict. It is possible
that nuclear proliferation **decreases conflict** through the
conflict-mitigating effects of extended nuclear deterrence and/or fear
of nuclear states' intervention, to the extent that these effects
**overwhelm** the conflict-provoking effect of nuclear--asymmetrical
dyads]{.underline}. Thus, dyadic-level empirics cannot solely be relied
on to infer causal links between nuclear proliferation and a systemic
propensity for conflict. The systemic-level empirics deserve attention.
