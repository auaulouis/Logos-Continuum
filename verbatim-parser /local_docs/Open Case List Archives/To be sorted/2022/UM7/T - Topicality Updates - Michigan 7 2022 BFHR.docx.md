## Security Cooperation

### Arms Sales

#### Arms Sales and Transfers require State Department involvement -- that's not Security cooperation

Congressional Review Process Informal Notifications [The Department of
State]{.underline} (on behalf of the President) [submits to the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee an
informal notification of a prospective major arms sale 20 calendar days
before the executive branch takes further formal action.]{.underline} An
August 2020 State Department Office of Inspector General report explains
that, in addition to the AECA formal notification process, \'the
Department has by long-standing practice submitted a preliminary or
informal notification of prospective major arms transfers in advance of
their formal notification to the congressional committees of
jurisdiction.\'/3 The informal notification practice began with a
February 18, 1976, letter from the Department of Defense making a
commitment to give Congress these preliminary classified
notifications./4 [Beginning in 2012, the State Department implemented a
new informal notification process, which the department calls a \"tiered
review,\" in]{.underline} which the relevant committees are notified
between 20 and 40 calendar days before receiving formal notification,
depending on the system and destination in question./5 \* \* \* 1
Originally titled The Foreign Military Sales Act. 2 For more
information, see CRS Report R46337, Transfer of Defense Articles: Sale

Arms Transfers to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates, Department of State Office of Inspector General ISP-I-20-19,
August 2020. 4 Letter of February 18, 1976 from Lt. Gen. H.M. Fish,
USAF, Director, Defense Security Assistance Agency to Senator Hubert H.
Humphrey, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. 5 Prior to giving such
notice, the State Department transmits to the committees any license
applications for commercially licensed arms sales as soon as the
department receives them. The State Department does not provide the same
notice regarding government-to-government foreign military sales. \* \*
\* During June 2017 testimony, [Acting Assistant Secretary of State Tina
Kaidanow described this process as a \'review period during which the
Committees can ask questions or raise concerns prior to the Department
of State initiating formal notification.]{.underline} The purpose is to
provide Congress the opportunity to raise concerns, and have these
concerns addressed, in a confidential process with the Administration,
so that our bilateral relationship with the country in question is
protected during this process.\'/6 [The State Department \"generally
will not formally notify an arms transfer if a member of Congress raises
significant concern]{.underline}s by placing a hold during the informal
review stage,\" the Inspector General report states, noting that \"the
Department is not precluded from proceeding with an arms transfer
subject to a congressional hold.\"/7 Formal Notifications The AEA
contains provisions for congressional review and disapproval of arms
sales. The President may not proceed with a proposed FMS or DCS
transaction if Congress adopts a joint resolution of disapproval within
the statutory review periods described below. It is worth noting that a
congressional recess or adjournment does not stop these review periods.
Foreign Military Sales Section 36(b)(1) of the AECA requires the
President formally to notify the Speaker of the House, as well as the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee,
30 calendar days before issuing a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA)
for an FMS-administered sale, enhancement, or upgrading of major defense
equipment valued at \$14 million or more; the sale, enhancement, or
upgrading of defense articles or services valued at \$50 million or
more; or the sale, enhancement, or upgrading of design and construction
services valued at \$200 million or more./8 The Defense Security
Cooperation Agency transmits the notifications to Congress./9 In the
case of such sales to NATO member states, NATO, Japan, Australia, South
Korea, Israel, or New Zealand, the President must formally notify
Congress 15 calendar days before proceeding with the sale./10 \* \* \* 6

(P.L. 93-559, 88 Stat. 1795) amended the Foreign Military Sales Act to
add a \$25 million dollar threshold for defense articles and services.
The International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of
1976 (P.L. 94-329, 90 Stat. 729) added major defense equipment with a
\$7 million threshold. The International Security and Development
Cooperation Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-113, 95 Stat. 1519) changed the \$7
million threshold to \$14 million and the \$25 million threshold to \$50
million. The International Security and Development Cooperation Act of
1980 (P.L. 96-533, 94 Stat. 3131) added design and construction services
with a \$200 million threshold. 9 See E.O. 13637, \"Administration of
Reformed Export Controls,\" March 8, 2013. 10 For the Senate, these
review periods appear to begin when the relevant Congressional
notification notice is published in the Congressional Record.

### Public Good

#### Security Cooperation must work towards overall public good

**Van Ness 08** \[Peter Van Ness is a Visiting Fellow, Department of

The future material gains from cooperation for all parties are
potentially immense, especially with respect to investment, trade and
technology transfer for the collaborative development and marketing of
Russian energy resources. Meanwhile, the US and China would maintain
their institutional ties in the region (for China, most importantly, the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization and ASEAN+3; and for the US, its
bilateral security ties with Japan, South Korea, Philippines, Thailand,
Singapore and Australia), but in Northeast Asia, the most potentially
volatile region in Asia, they would work together. Other countries in
the Asia--Pacific may wonder about how such a new institution in which
they do not directly participate will affect them. Seen in realist
terms, those governments might worry that the security arrangement had
been designed as a conspiracy against them. But cooperative security
provides a different understanding. [Multilateral security cooperation
by a group of states in one region not only enhances their own security
but also produces a public good of strategic stability for the larger
community of nations.]{.underline} ASEAN has shown the way. [The
cooperative-security design]{.underline} in ASEAN [has been built on a
network of economic and political ties and strategic
dialogue]{.underline}. If the Six Party Talks on Korea can now achieve
as much as ASEAN already has achieved for its member-states (i.e., to
make inter-state war among any of its members unthinkable), all
countries in the region would benefit. Other countries in the region
like Australia would not directly participate in the new institution,
but they would benefit from the strategic stability and shared security
achieved by the new, [multilateral cooperative-security consortium---a
public good]{.underline}.

## Artificial Intelligence

### AI v Autonomous

#### Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous systems are distinct

FAMU-FSU College of Engineering. She graduated summa cum laude with a
Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering. She was an active member

The terms in which the international community discusses lethal
autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) can at times be ambiguous as there is
an absence of a common vocabulary and common understanding of the terms
autonomy and artificial intelligence (AI). LAWS are weapons systems that
apply lethal force independently, with freedom from human control. [AI
has many subfields including machine learning, data mining, speech
recognition, and image processing. Policymakers frequently refer to any
of the subfields of AI as AI.]{.underline} By [grouping these various
terms together under the umbrella of AI, the term is frequently misused
by technical experts, policymakers, and the general public.]{.underline}
As advances in technology lead to increased autonomy in systems, [the
terms AI and autonomy are frequently used together. Despite their
relationship to each other, it is a mistake to use these terms
interchangeably.]{.underline} Currently, the international discussion
does not define the technical characteristics of LAWS, hindering the
development of public policies, laws, and practices related to the use
of autonomy and AI in weapons systems. To improve understanding of the
technical characteristics of autonomy and AI in LAWS, this paper aims
provides the following recommendations. Recommendation 1: Classify the
level of autonomy and intelligence in current weapon systems. Members of
the international discussion on LAWS should evaluate where current
weapon systems fall on the spectrum of intelligence and autonomy and
should consider which of those should or should not be a part of the
continuing discussion. Recommendation 2: Limit the use of the term
Artificial Intelligence. While potential exists for fully-autonomous
intelligent weapon systems, they are not a current reality. [Using the
term AI to refer to machine learning, computer vision, natural language
processing, and many other fields of study limits the development of
public policy because there is no individual evaluation for their
potential positive or negative impact on LAWS.]{.underline}
Recommendation 4: Distinguish autonomous systems from autonomous
intelligent agents. [An autonomous system does not imply the use of AI,
whereas autonomous intelligent agent does. These terms represent
significantly different technologies that warrant separate
discussion]{.underline}. Recommendation 5: Distinguish between semi- and
fully-autonomous systems. To make progress developing public policies
regarding LAWS, the discussion must distinguish semi-autonomous systems
from fully-autonomous systems. [Regulating the two technologies with the
same set of policies ultimately will be unsuccessful.]{.underline}

#### AI has to problem solve not complete a task

**Ball 20** \[Inertial Sense has released the following article
explaining the difference between autonomy and artificial intelligence
(AI) as the two concepts relate to robotic systems. Inertial Sense is
the developer of LUNA, an automated navigation software platform
designed for robotics companies who want to make their existing fleet
unmanned and automated.
https://www.unmannedsystemstechnology.com/2020/11/artificial-intelligence-vs-autonomy-for-mobile-robotics/\]//LP

[Artificial Intelligence vs. Autonomy]{.underline} Artificial
intelligence applications and autonomy are both valuable tools in the
industrial environment. These technologies can be used independently or
can work together to achieve the desired results. Here's an easy way to
breakdown the differences between the two: [autonomous robotics = task
completion and AI = problem-solving. Autonomous robotics systems are
designed for use in predictable environments to complete tasks within a
specific, usually pre-planned, environment. Sensors are of critical
importanc]{.underline}e in providing robots with detailed and accurate
information about their location within the domain. [Autonomous robotics
systems rely on these sensors to navigate their
environments]{.underline} and to perform their tasks quickly and
effectively. Autonomous devices and systems can be powered by
conventional software or by AI systems that allow them to learn and
adapt as they operate. [Artificial intelligence]{.underline} is defined
by Yale University as ["building systems that can solve complex tasks in
ways that would traditionally need human intelligence." This typically
involves machine learning technologies]{.underline} and the use of
highly advanced sensors to collect information about the environment and
to allow the system to react appropriately to external stimuli.

[National cybersecurity involves tradeoffs with government intervention
and market-based incentives for technological innovation, and
theoretical reformulation of innovation mechanisms]{.underline} towards
this lens is the subject of this Article. [The patent system has been
considered as supporting the establishment of a market of new
technologies]{.underline} by providing incentives for invention,
promoting the financing of innovation, and stimulating competition
through exclusion. As such, while the patent system is a
government-driven mechanism, the market foundation role of patents
supports the market development of new technologies. \[\*488\] [The
parsing out of the government\'s need to provide national cybersecurity
versus the private market in being able to provide national
cybersecurity raises the question as to whether the patent system
provides sufficient incentives for national cybersecurity
innovation.]{.underline} A variety of innovation mechanisms could
promote national cybersecurity innovation, and a comparison of the role
of government and the market presents innovation policy considerations
for society. [Implicit in this analysis is that the patent system has
some role in technological advancement for national
cybersecurity.]{.underline} However, inventors and patent holders lack
inadequate incentives from the patent system for national cybersecurity
inventions, for which the guarantee of the reward is too small, the
possibility of the reward is uncertain, or the transaction cost is too
high. As a result, the patent system is inadequate to promote national
cybersecurity innovation. Such limitations may push some national
cybersecurity innovators towards trade secrecy, which presents a
different set of problems, including whether and how they can help
foster technological advancement to protect the critical infrastructure.
The purpose of this Article is to assess how important the patent system
is to national cybersecurity. If one unequivocal conclusion follows from
this Article in addressing this tradeoff for achieving national
cybersecurity, it is that patents may not be a good match when their
disclosure is kept secret or when their interests can be taken by
government, and technological innovation for critical infrastructure
protection can be better oriented through prize funding or a better way
to encourage public-private research and development (\"R&D\").
[Innovation mechanisms for technological advancement present unique
challenges for national cybersecurity, including market failure,
government failure, and co-mingled public-private infrastructure
elements]{.underline}. At a theoretical economic level, inventors and
innovators will not make investments in national cybersecurity R&D and
individuals hope to reap its benefits without contribution to its
technology development - a conundrum that warrants government
intervention. 17Link to the text of the note

[In the late 2000s and early 2010s]{.underline}, despite continued legal
uncertainty in the United States and globally, [debates about active
cyber defense began to shift.]{.underline} More frequent cyber attacks
increasing anxiety likely contributed to this change of perception; for
instance, by 2010, more than forty percent of companies surveyed by
Symantec reported that cybersecurity incidents topped their lists of
concerns. As was mentioned above, one watershed moment was Operation
Aurora, a sophisticated campaign using spear phishing attacks and at
least one zero-day exploit exposed by Google in early 2010 The attacks
were noteworthy for at least two reasons: the type of intellectual
property that was stolen (including Google\'s source code\--that is, its
\"crown jewels\" 116Link to the text of the note) and the illustration
of the extent to which state-sponsored attacks\--or other highly
organized and well-financed attackers\--had begun targeting private
firms. 117Link to the text of the note According to Dmitri Alperovitch,
then-vice president of threat research at the antivirus firm McAfee,
Operation Aurora \"totally\" changed the threat model, representing the
first instance in which private firms (outside defense contractors)
experienced \"that level of sophisticated attack.\" 118Link to the text
of the note Moreover, in Google\'s private investigation, the company
gained access to a computer, located in Taiwan, \"that it suspected of
being the source of the \[Aurora\] attacks.\" 119Link to the text of the
note When it saw evidence of attacks involving other U.S. companies,
Google alerted and collaborated with U.S. intelligence and law
enforcement agencies to trace ultimate responsibility for the \[\*750\]
attacks back to mainland China. 120Link to the text of the note As such,
Google may have \"set a precedent of what is allowable\" to defend
against APTs\--even as \"one could imagine similar scenarios that could
lead to civil or criminal charges.\" 121Link to the text of the note
Operation Aurora did much to introduce the private sector to the concept
of APTs, a term that, like \"active defense,\" was borrowed from the
military. 122Link to the text of the note In 2011, McAfee defined APTs
as \"sophisticated, covert attacks bent on surreptitiously stealing
valuable data from targeted and unsuspecting companies\" and claimed
that such \"targeted attacks are on the rise.\" 123Link to the text of
the note Yet defining APTs may be a malleable and circumstantial
exercise\--and may even represent a politically or economically minded
euphemism. In 2011, for example, the CEO of security firm HBGary said
that the definition of an APT varies depending on \"who you ask,\" and
[the terminology really only emerged because the U.S. Department of
Defense and Air Force needed a \"nice way\" to refer to Chinese
state-sponsored threats]{.underline}. 124Link to the text of the note
Likewise, McAfee has argued that \"the motive of the adversary ... is
the primary differentiator of an APT attack from a cybercriminal or
hacktivist one\" and agrees that APTs are targeted attacks \"carried out
under the sponsorship or direction of a nation-state \[\*751\] for
something other than a pure financial/criminal reason or political
protest.\" 125Link to the text of the note Yet this statement fails to
appreciate that determining which motive dominates can be an even more
daunting challenge than establishing attribution. Even though some
industry experts have suggested that \"APT hysteria\" was overblown, and
\"some who \[thought\] that they \[were\] victims of APTs \[were\]
really the victims of organized criminals, hacktivists, glorified script
kiddies, and their own mistakes,\" evidence clearly demonstrates that
malware has become more \"customized,\" meaning anything from a simple
repackaging of existing malware to \"code written from the ground up for
a specific attack.\" 126Link to the text of the note By 2013, more
security experts claimed that sophisticated, targeted attacks posed the
greatest information security \"danger\" for businesses that
[traditional defense technologies were \"slowly losing relevance\"
because they were ineffective]{.underline}, 128Link to the text of the
note and that companies were increasingly frustrated by attempting to
protect themselves \"with a purely defensive posture.\" 129\][APTs are
built to circumvent passive cyber defenses like firewalls and antivirus
software]{.underline}. Private sector actors\' self-reporting suggests
that most advanced attacks go unnoticed for more than one year (and are
often ultimately noticed by a third party); a reasonable conclusion is
that APTs often circumvent purely defensive postures. In the early
2010s, continuing \"massive cases of cyber exploitation,\" including
GhostNet, Night Dragon, and Shady RAT, significantly harmed companies
and advanced both media exposure and private \[\*752\] sector
cybersecurity concerns, 131Link to the text of the note reinforcing the
perception that APTs were the new norm. 132Link to the text of the note
Moreover, APTs tipped cyber offense-and-defense asymmetry even further
in the attackers\' favor. Attackers already benefitted from the
comparatively small risk of being caught and prosecuted; conversely,
defenders already were forced to make significant investments and accept
greater risks when deciding how to defend their networks. The rise of
APTs enabled attackers to access greater resources and more advanced
technologies (such as from a state sponsor or criminal organization)
while private sector defenders continued to struggle to increase IT
security budgets and employ less sophisticated technologies. According
to security expert Keren Elazari in a report prepared for CrowdStrike,
Simply put, the bad guys are gaining the upper hand[. Cybercrime and
corporate espionage attackers are persistent\--and they only need to get
in once]{.underline}... Advanced attackers are using previously unknown
zero-day vulnerabilities and self-mutating, evasive, and polymorphic
malware while detection rates of existing protection mechanisms are
falling. Defenders are facing more malware and more sophistication.
Attacks are as lucrative as ever for advanced and commonplace
adversaries. Clearly, the time has come for a strategic shift of focus
for cybersecurity. [Active defense has emerged as the new security
paradigm that can help defenders resolve the gap between detection and
response and make life more difficult for attackers.]{.underline} [In
the face of escalating numbers and sophistication of cyber threats, and
the imbalance between attackers and defenders, active defense emerged
post-2010 as a practice that allows companies to increase the costs to
adversaries attacking them\-\--just as, in the physical world, allowing
individuals to engage in self-defense increases the potential costs for
would-be attackers, therefore possibly dissuading some
attackers]{.underline}. However, even though active cyber defense is
increasingly emerging as a \[\*753\] sensible or \"logical\" approach by
which the private sector can shift a greater burden to attackers, what
has been less clear is how [the broader cybersecurity industry is
evolving to support more proactive measures. The cybersecurity industry
is an essential part of the evolution, as expertise and cybersecurity
best practices reside in this space]{.underline}. Part II picks up this
debate by couching it in the experience of dozens of cybersecurity
companies and then focusing on four case studies before pivoting to
consider some of the implications for businesses and policy makers in
Part III.

A. An Introduction to Customary International Cybersecurity Law [One
precedent informing customary international cybersecurity law was
articulated by the ICJ in the Nicaragua v. United States
case]{.underline} (Nicaragua), which involved a dispute over the United
States\' involvement with the Contra rebellion in Nicaragua. 11Link to
the text of the note In Nicaragua, the ICJ held that customary
international obligations would arise from the consistent, widespread
practice of States engaging in specific acts or omissions, performed out
of a sense of obligation that such acts or omissions were required by
international law (opinio juris). [The combination of opinio juris and
State practice performed by a significant number of States and without
the express disavowal of a significant number of other States, gives
rise to international obligations under customary international law. The
underlying rationale is that this combination reflects a consensus in
the international community that the actions taken represent an
international obligation.]{.underline} Despite Nicaragua\'s clear
articulation of the rule, in practice, the development of customary
international law presents a temporal dilemma. [For a State to engage in
actions out of a sense of legal duty, this decision presupposes the
existence of such a duty, and therefore the prior existence of customary
international law on a certain issue]{.underline}. 14Link to the text of
the note To help resolve this dilemma, Professor Frederic Kirgis argued
for what he calls a \"sliding scale\" approach. 15Link to the text of
the note Professor Kirgis argues State practice and opinio juris need to
be understood on a spectrum, wherein the requirement for opinio juris
increases as the evidence of State practice decreases. Rather than
\[\*6\] impose strict requirements for both State practice and opinio
juris, the sliding scale approach argues that a strong history of State
practice can give rise to international obligations absent opinio juris.
16Link to the text of the note Likewise, compelling opinio juris could
give rise to international obligations with little evidence of State
practice. 17Link to the text of the note The sliding scale approach may
prove particularly important in the cybersecurity realm as these novel
technologies have developed too rapidly for evidence of widespread State
practice to emerge, yet compelling opinio juris may still form the basis
for international obligations. Proving opinio juris, however, is a
difficult task, especially in the cyber context. The temporal dilemma
makes pointing to existing rules challenging, so the preferred method is
to identify broad principles that enjoy widespread international
agreement, which the ICJ suggests may be evidenced by treaties. 18Link
to the text of the note Indeed, most courts rely on treaties to identify
opinio juris, often exclusively so. 19Link to the text of the note Yet
in the cyber realm, treaties have largely focused on implementing
domestic cybercrime laws and have done relatively little to address
cybersecurity standards, leaving such decisions to the private sector
and standards bodies such as the NIST Framework, discussed below. 20Link
to the text of the note So using cybercrime as an example,
[international agreements like the Budapest Convention, the African
Union Convention on Cybersecurity and Data Protection, and the various
Association of Southeast Asian Nations working groups on cybercrime all
could serve as opinio juris that States have an obligation to enact and
enforce cybercrime laws within their territories and to cooperate to
prosecute and extradite cybercriminals. Even though these agreements
often lack binding language]{.underline}, they nonetheless suggest a
growing international consensus that the establishment of domestic
cybercrime laws is an international obligation. 21Link to the text of
the note Similarly, the Organization of American States has also
encouraged Member States to join the Budapest Convention and to increase
regional cooperation to mitigate cybercrime, whereas a nonbinding U.N.
General Assembly Resolution calls on States to \"eliminate safe havens\"
for cybercriminals. 22Link to the text of the note Declarations like
\[\*7\] these, although non-binding, serve as further evidence of
international consensus regarding cybercrime. While it is unlikely that
a non-signatory State would be bound to the specific terms of a treaty
to which it did not sign\--particularly in the short term\--that treaty
may still serve to identify broad principles that form opinio juris and
thereby can build a foundation for international obligations. The search
for cybersecurity opinio juris is further complicated by the
multifaceted cyber threat comprising cybercrime, espionage, terrorism,
and war. While the classification of State cyber-activities is a
well-known problem, 23Link to the text of the note the fact that these
activities are so widespread suggests a lack of opinio juris against
aggressive State cyber-activity below the armed-attack threshold. The
ambiguity surrounding State cyber-activities is further reinforced by
discussions of the international law relating to espionage, which is
largely unregulated outside the law of war context. 24Link to the text
of the note Similarly, domestic cybersecurity practices are highly
variable and can involve the surreptitious installation of malware\--as
alleged of Chinese telecommunications providers and the National
Security Agency (NSA) alike\--discussed further below. 25Link to the
text of the note Given the relative lack of multilateral progress,
claiming a widespread consensus for an underlying cybersecurity norm is
challenging: a situation that can only be marginally mitigated by
investigating related ICJ jurisprudence on the subject. B. ICJ
Jurisprudence as It Relates to Cybersecurity Due Diligence Although the
ICJ has never directly addressed cybersecurity due diligence
requirements, its cases discussing due diligence generally can serve as
broad guideposts to infer cyber-specific applications. It is worth
noting that these cases all arose prior to the proliferation of cyber
attacks, but some of the principles that underlay the cases, including
Corfu Channel, Trail Smelter, and Nicaragua, may still have some
applicability. 26Link to the text of the note Before reviewing these
cases though, it is first important to define
\"[cybersecurity]{.underline} due diligence.\" In the transactional
context, this term has \[\*8\] [been defined as \'\"the review of the
governance, processes and controls that are used to secure information
assets]{.underline}.\"\' 27Link to the text of the note The concept as
it is used in this Article builds from this definition and may be
understood as the customary national and international obligations of
both State and non-State actors to help identify and instill
cybersecurity best practices and effective governance mechanisms so as
to promote cyber peace through enhancing the security of computers,
networks, and Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
infrastructure. Cybersecurity due diligence obligations may exist
between States, between non-State actors (for example, private
corporations, end-users), and between State and non-State actors.
Applicable instruments include technical standards, legal requirements
born from treaty or custom, as well as national policies and
private-sector industry norms, discussed below. 28Link to the text of
the note [We will proceed by highlighting three international
obligations identified by the ICJ: the duty to warn, the \"no harm\"
principle, and non-intervention, which we will use to infer
cyber-specific applications and identify potential
problems]{.underline}. We will then go on to address the law governing
countermeasures for when an international obligation is violated,
address its applicability to cyber-operations, and consider the
implications for cyber due diligence.
