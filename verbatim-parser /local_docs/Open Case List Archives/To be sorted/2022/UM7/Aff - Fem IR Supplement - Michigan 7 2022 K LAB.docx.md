### NATO = Imperialistic

**Turn- NATO is imperialistic**

**[This political and military organization hegemonized by the United
States in an alliance with European imperialism has experienced
significant internal tensions]{.underline}** throughout its 73-year
history.**^3^** However, after what was perhaps the period of greatest
internal decline, during Donald Trump's presidency, it has been
unexpectedly **[revitalized by the war in Ukraine.]{.underline}**
Several member states have **[committed to increasing their military
budgets to 2% of their GDP,]{.underline}** thus fulfilling a NATO
requirement with which, until now, few states had complied. The
**[summit will be marked by the militaristic escalation and the
rearmament of all imperialist states under the guise of "defending
democracy."]{.underline}**

In this article we review part of its recent history to debate against
the idea that it is possible for NATO to play a "democratic" or
"progressive" role internationally, which has been widely repeated in
Western media. But not only there. On several occasions, but especially
now in the context of the war in Ukraine, **[we have seen "progressive"
groups or sectors of the left embellish the role played by NATO, as if
it were a progressive camp fighting against Putin's reactionary
regime.]{.underline}**

**[NATO is an imperialist war machine at the service of US and European
expansionism.]{.underline}** In our time we will undoubtedly see
increasing confrontations between world powers, as shown by the war in
Ukraine.
