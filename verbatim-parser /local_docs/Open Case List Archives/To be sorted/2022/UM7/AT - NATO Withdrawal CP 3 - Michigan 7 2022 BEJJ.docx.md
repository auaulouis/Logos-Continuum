RIGA, Latvia (AP) --- [U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday
assured Lithuania]{.underline} and Latvia of NATO [protection and
American support]{.underline} as he made quick visits to two of the
three Baltic states that are increasingly on edge as Russia presses
ahead with its invasion of Ukraine.

[Along with Estonia]{.underline}, which Blinken will visit on Tuesday,
the [former Soviet republics are NATO]{.underline}
[members]{.underline}, and the [Biden administration is aiming to calm
any fears]{.underline} they have about their security in the event
Russia chooses to expand its military operations.

In the Latvian capital of Riga, Blinken said the [Baltics have "formed a
democratic wall that now stands against the tide of
autocracy"]{.underline} that Russia is pushing in Europe. "[The United
States is more committed than ever]{.underline} to standing with you as
our democracies rise to the challenge," he said.

"We are [bolstering our shared defense]{.underline} so that we and our
allies are prepared," Blinken said. He stressed that the U.S. commitment
to NATO's mutual defense pact [is "sacrosanct]{.underline}" and that
NATO and the United States were discussing the permanent basing of
troops in the Baltics.

"[We will defend every inch of NATO territory if it comes under
attack,"]{.underline} he said. "No one should doubt our readiness. [No
one should doubt our **resolve**."]{.underline}

[Leaders in both countries expressed **grave** **concerns**]{.underline}
about Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions as it relates to
former Soviet bloc countries that are now allied or otherwise linked to
the West.

["We have **no illusions** about Putin's Russia anymore]{.underline},"
Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said after meeting Blinken in
Riga. "We don't really see any good reason to assume that [Russia might
change its policy."]{.underline}

Rinkevics said that the [Russian invasion of Ukraine had shown the
Baltic countries in particular **the need to bolster air and coastal
defenses**]{.underline} and that Latvia would like its security
cooperation with NATO to be "more efficient."

"Unfortunately, [the worsening security situation in the Baltic region
is of great concern]{.underline} for all of us and around the world,"
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told Blinken earlier in Vilnius.
["Russia's reckless aggression against]{.underline} Ukraine once again
proves that it is [a long-term threat]{.underline} to European security,
[the security of our alliance."]{.underline}

[Memories of Soviet rule are still fresh in the Baltics]{.underline} and
since the invasion of Ukraine last month, [NATO has moved quickly to
boost its troop presence]{.underline} in its eastern flank allies while
the U.S. has pledged additional support.

[Blinken's opened his Baltic tour in Vilnius,]{.underline} where
Lithuanian support for Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion was
palpable as signs of solidarity with Ukrainians are evident in many
businesses and on houses, public buildings and buses[. He later traveled
to Riga, which has been similarly festooned with blue and yellow
Ukrainian flags.]{.underline}

Lithuania's Nauseda said [a policy of deterrence was no longer
enough]{.underline} and that "forward defense" was now needed. He
predicted that "[Putin will not stop in Ukraine if he will not be
stopped."]{.underline}

"It is [our collective duty]{.underline} as a nation to help all
Ukrainians with all means available," said Nauseda. "By saying all, I
mean, indeed all means all, [if we want to avoid the Third World War.
The choice is in our hands."]{.underline}

Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis called for a surge in
assistance to Ukraine, noting that the NATO allies "are doing a lot, but
we cannot stop." He also called for an immediate halt to imports of
Russian energy. "We cannot pay for oil and gas with Ukrainian blood," he
said.

[Lithuania is also dealing with pressure from another large power ---
China --- for its relationship with Taiwan,]{.underline} the island
China regards as a renegade province. China has taken actions, including
halting imports of certain products, against Lithuania for allowing
Taiwan to open a de facto embassy in Vilnius.

[Blinken said the Ukraine situation was relevant to Lithuania's Taiwan
situation as all countries should have the right to pursue their own
foreign policies]{.underline}. "Every nation is free to associate with
whom it chooses," he said. "[The United States continues to stand by
Lithuania]{.underline} and every nation to choose its own path."

Blinken arrived in the Baltics late Sunday from non-aligned Moldova,
which is also warily watching the war on its doorstep, and Poland, where
he visited the Polish-Ukrainian border and met with refugees from
Ukraine.

After his meetings with senior Latvian officials and Israeli Foreign
Minister Yair Lapid in Riga, Blinken will visit Tallinn, Estonia on
Tuesday and then go on to Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel
Macron.

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett met with Putin over the weekend
and Macron has been in frequent contact with the Russian leader. Both
Israel and France sought meetings with Blinken to discuss those
interactions.

Blinken declined to discuss those meetings in detail before they have
been held but said: "There is certainly no change in our message to
Moscow, our message to Russia and to President Putin**[: End the war.
End it now."]{.underline}**

### 2AC -- Baltics -- Turn

#### Continued solidarity to the Baltics ensure the strength of democratic leadership and European security

Sally A. **Painter, 20;** Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of Blue
Star Strategies, LLC, Atlantic Council board director, and a senior
adviser to the Atlantic Council's Future Europe Initiative; "US must
remain committed to NATO and the Baltic States" Sept. 8, 2020
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/us-must-remain-committed-to-nato-and-the-baltic-states//ekc

[The three **Baltic** countries of Northern Europe have long been
**allies** of the United States and **valued** members of the NATO
community.]{.underline} In the 20th century, the [**U**nited **S**tates
**refused** to recognize the **Soviet Union's claim**]{.underline} on
Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia and [supported the restoration of their
independence]{.underline} in 1991. Our [Baltic friends never forgot this
important solidarity,]{.underline} and since then [have **promoted
democracy** and **stability** in their corner of Europe]{.underline} and
[worked diligently to attain membership in NATO and the EU
community]{.underline} through [systemic reforms to their economy,
governance, and security]{.underline}. Rightfully so, the Baltics saw
their [**integration** into Euro-Atlantic institutions as an important
**deterrent** to Russian influence]{.underline}, which continues to loom
as a regional threat to their sovereignty and national security.

These [**threats** have only **escalated**]{.underline} since Russia's
invasion of Georgia in 2008 and the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in
2014. In this context[, it is **vital** that the United States firmly
**recommit to NATO** and increase its support of the Baltic
countries]{.underline} to ensure [the continuation of strong bilateral
relations]{.underline} and the effective partnerships that have
[strengthened the entire transatlantic community.]{.underline}

Membership in **[NATO]{.underline}**, a long-time aspiration for the
Baltics, [required]{.underline} that they undergo robust
[changes]{.underline}, and the [subsequent reform process]{.underline}
served as [a key element for strengthening bilateral relations with the
United States]{.underline} and a foundational pillar of transatlantic
security. Since their accession in 2004, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia
have [been responsible members of, and active contributors to, the NATO
alliance. Despite the size of their national military
forces]{.underline}, each country has [actively supported regional
security]{.underline} in Europe and participated in global NATO
activities, including [contributing troops to missions in
Afghanistan]{.underline}. By 2019, all three countries increased their
defense spending to the recommended two percent of their overall
national budgets.

This upwards trajectory has resulted in vital support from the
international community. At the 2016 NATO Summit in Warsaw, Poland[,
NATO reaffirmed its support for the Baltics]{.underline} by introducing
Enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) units to all three Baltic states as well
as Poland. NATO also now [provides fighter aircraft to the
Baltics]{.underline}, which have been increased following the 2014
Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Unfortunately, the [non-permanent nature]{.underline} of these programs
is [not sufficient to guarantee the full military
capabilities]{.underline} of the Baltics nor to bring peace of mind to
its citizens. [Given increased Russian presence in the region, each
country must rely heavily on the collective defense agreement of the
North Atlantic Treaty]{.underline} if it hopes to stand a chance against
foreign interference. The United States together with its European
partners and the international community must do more to prevent such
foreign interference and ensure that the Baltic states are fully
equipped with the tools and support structures that underpin their
security.

To date, the [United States has demonstrated its **support** for the
Baltic region **through** the **US-Baltic Charter**]{.underline}, an
alliance of values among the countries [signed in 1998.]{.underline} The
signatories agreed to a shared vision "of a peaceful and [increasingly
integrated Europe]{.underline}, free of divisions, dedicated to
[democracy]{.underline}, the rule of law, free markets, and respect for
the human rights and fundamental [freedoms of all people]{.underline}."
The Charter's emphasis on the vitality of independence and territorial
integrity established grounds for a prosperous partnership and paved the
way for Baltic integration into NATO. [It provides **an established
path** to follow for **re-engaging** with our **allies** and
strengthening this vital transatlantic partnership.]{.underline} Perhaps
even more so than in any recent year, [this mission remains relevant and
timely.]{.underline}

Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia [have strongly demonstrated their
dedication]{.underline} to the transatlantic alliance and have [**worked
diligently** to implement systematic **reforms** on a variety of shared
concerns ranging from energy **security**, transparency, and economic
**vitality**.]{.underline}

It is [therefore highly unfortunate to witness recent statements and
actions taken by US President Donald Trump]{.underline} that [do not
appear to recognize these important achievements]{.underline} nor the
Baltics' role as vital allies. Recent public comments by the president
and in private conversations reported by former National Security
Advisor John Bolton indicate that rather than strengthening and
appreciating the value of the NATO Alliance, if elected to a second
term, President Trump may wish to pull the United States out of the
North Atlantic Treaty. This has not gone unnoticed by our European
friends. A recent New York Times article notes analysis by the Atlantic
Council's Jorge Benitez that some European officials "see the escalation
of negative steps, and they are definitely concerned that that negative
pattern could continue if Trump is re-elected." [This concern is not
only worrying to Europeans but also to many leaders in the US
Congress.]{.underline} Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), a senior member of
the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations warned in the same article
that ["withdrawing from NATO would be nothing short of
catastrophic."]{.underline}

The [United States has **profound** **interests** in **maintaining**
**NATO** and the sovereignty and security of the Baltic
region]{.underline}. [Now is the time for the United States to rise to
this leadership role]{.underline} by deepening our commitment to NATO
and supporting the Baltic countries to foster a strong and united
transatlantic community. [There exists today the opportunity to work on
**a new US-Baltic Charter** to address today's challenges]{.underline}.
These could include promoting democracy, free and fair elections, and
freedom of the press in the region; combating disinformation; expanding
bilateral trade and investment between the United States and the
Baltics; and supporting nations that wish to join the Euro-Atlantic
family. Just as in 1991[**, a show of solidarity** by the United States
can help **strengthen** and protect the Baltic State]{.underline}s,
allowing them to continue to grow and faithfully contribute to the
transatlantic community.

### 2AC -- France 

#### France wants US involvement defensively 

**Pannier, 2-4** (Alice Pannier, 2-4-22, assistant professor of European
studies and international relations at Johns Hopkins University\'s
School of Advanced International Studies,
[https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/how-to-keep-france-engaged-in-nato///mahimahi
)](https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/how-to-keep-france-engaged-in-nato///mahimahi%20))

[French-US relations are a key factor in determining the French attitude
towards NATO, even if the Alliance is not the primary vehicle for
**defence and security cooperation** between Paris and
Washington]{.underline}. [Two factors matter in particular: the extent
to which Paris perceives that Washington takes into account the
**security concerns of Europeans,**]{.underline} not least in the Middle
East and Africa; [and the [US
attitude](https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/one-plus-four-what-natos-new-strategic-concept-should-say-and-how-to-achieve-it/) towards
European **defence initiatives**]{.underline}.

On the former, French authorities are concerned about the gradual US
disengagement from unstable regions, not least the Sahel and the Middle
East. Seen from Paris, a US disengagement from the Middle East and
Africa would hurt European interests by harming their counter-terrorist
efforts, which could potentially lead to the emergence of new havens for
terrorist networks and organised crime, and/or would let other powers
fill the vacuum and gain influence in Europe's vicinity. [Thus, the
French government expressed a particularly **strong reaction** in 2019
when the US announced its intention of [withdrawing troops from northern
Syria](https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/commentaries/syria-strains-turkeys-ties-to-the-west-even-after-us-withdrawal/) without
prior **consultation with its European allies**.]{.underline} In the
view of French diplomats, the discrepancy between US and European
security interests, which has led the US to be unwilling to take
military or political risks in the MENA region, was not the result of
Trump's election but of a longer-term shift in US foreign policy
priorities. The incoming [Biden
Administration](https://especiales.realinstitutoelcano.org/eeuu/2020/) was
seen as a hopeful sign for transatlantic cooperation in a increasingly
degraded strategic environment. The messy disengagement from Afghanistan
in August 2021 and the 'blundering' lack of consultation ahead of the
AUKUS alliance announcement in September 2021 illustrate that effective
foreign policy coordination should be at the heart of NATO's role in the
coming years.

#### Both presidents have shared interests over NATO 

**White House, 11-29** (White House, 1-29-21, "United States-Fra ce
Joint Statement,"
<https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/29/united-states-france-joint-statement/>//mahimahi)

[The Presidents resolve to maintain our **collective defense
and security**, cultivate our resilience, enhance their solidarity,
and ensure **international stability in** **response** to the full range
of modern threats. The United States and France share the goal of
continuing to bolster deterrence as a core element of our collective
defense and to contribute to the indivisible security of
the NATO Alliance. \
\]{.underline}
The fundamental purpose of NATO's nuclear capability is to preserve
peace, prevent coercion, and deter aggression.  [Given the deteriorating
security environment in Europe, we reaffirm that a **credible and united
nuclear Alliance** is essential. In light of this security environment,
allies should continue close **consultations on nuclear and arms control
matters**, particularly within NATO. We will
work together to strengthen arms control, disarmament, and
non-proliferation, as a key element of Euro-Atlantic
security.\]{.underline}
\
[As noted in the September 22 **Joint Statement **between the two
Presidents, the United States recognizes the importance of a stronger
and more capable European defense that contributes positively to global
and transatlantic security and is complementary to NATO. The United
States supports European Allies' and Partners' **growing investments in
the military capabilities** that enable our shared defense, given the
benefit to transatlantic security of stronger European military
capabilities and more committed European partners.]{.underline} 
European-led missions and operations such as in the Sahel and in Bosnia
are positively contributing to transatlantic security.\
\
[The Presidents reaffirm their support
for **strengthening the NATO-EU strategic partnership,** which is unique
and essential for the security and prosperity of our nations and of the
Euro-Atlantic area. They support the invitation of the EU and other
partners to the upcoming NATO Leaders' Summit in Madrid in
2022.]{.underline} [The **Presidents also reaffirm support
for a U.S.-EU dialogue** on security and defense and work towards an
Administrative Arrangement for the United States with the European
Defense Agency, as decided at the U.S.-EU Summit in June.]{.underline} \
\
The Presidents affirm the importance of stronger and interoperable
defense industrial bases in Europe and in the United States, which will
deliver better military capabilities, to the benefit of the
Alliance. [The Presidents intend to launch a **U.S.-France defense trade
strategic dialogue** to foster a shared view on defense market access
and export issues. In]{.underline} this context, the two governments
will identify steps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
defense export authorizations.
