crippling, the first striker has a huge advantage. This makes EMP

**1 in 100000 chance of extinction from nuke war\-\--their own authors
admit it isn't existential**

**Ladish 20**, 11-6-2020, [Jeffrey
Ladish](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/landfish) author who has
extensively studied the effects of nuclear war on human populations
\"Nuclear war is unlikely to cause human extinction,\"
https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sT6NxFxso6Z9xjS7o/nuclear-war-is-unlikely-to-cause-human-extinction

A number of people have claimed that a full-scale nuclear war is likely
to cause human extinction. [I have investigated this issue in depth and
concluded that [even a full scale nuclear exchange is]{.mark} unlikely
[(\<1%) to cause]{.mark} human [extinction.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

By a full-scale war, I mean a nuclear exchange between major world
powers, such as the US, Russia, and China, using the complete arsenals
of each country. [[The]{.mark} total [number of warheads]{.mark} today
(14,000) [is]{.mark} significantly [smaller]{.mark} than during the
height of the cold war (70,000).]{.underline} While extinction from
nuclear war is unlikely today, it may become more likely if
significantly more warheads are deployed or if designs of weapons change
significantly.

There are three potential mechanisms of human extinction from nuclear
war:

1\) Kinetic destruction

2\) Radiation

3\) Climate alteration

Only 3) is remotely plausible with existing weapons, but let\'s go
through them all.

1\) Kinetic destruction

[[There]{.mark} simply [aren\'t enough]{.mark} nuclear [warheads to kill
everyone]{.mark} directly with kinetic force,]{.underline} [and there
likely never will be]{.underline}. There are \~14,000 nuclear weapons in
the world, and let's suppose they have an average yield of something
like 1 megaton. This is a conservative guess, the actual average is
probably closer to 100 kilotons. With a 1 megaton warhead, you can
create a fireball covering 3 km², and a moderate pressure wave that
knocks down most residential houses covering 155 km². The former kills
nearly everyone and the latter kills a decent percentage of people but
not everyone. Let\'s be conservative and assume the pressure wave kills
everyone in its radius. 14,000 \* 155 = 2.17 million km². The New York
Metro area is 8,683 km². [So all the nuclear weapons in the world could
destroy about 250 New York Metro areas. This is a lot! But not near
enough, even if someone intentionally tried to hit all the populations
at once.]{.underline} Total land surface of earth is: 510.1 million km².
Urban area, by one estimate, is about 2%, or 10.2 million km.² Since
[the total possible area destroyed from nuclear weapons is \~2.17
million km² is considerably less than a lower bound on the area of human
habitation, 10.2 million km², there should be [basically no risk of
human extinction from]{.mark} kinetic [destruction]{.mark}.]{.underline}

If you want to check my work there, I was using [nuke
map](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=1000&lat=40.7648&lng=-73.9808&hob_psi=5&hob_ft=10245&psi=20,5,1&zm=11). 

The even more obvious reason why kinetic damage wouldn\'t lead to human
extinction is that [[nuclear states only threaten one or several
countries at a time]{.mark}, [and never]{.mark} the [population
centers]{.mark} of the entire world. [Even if]{.mark} NATO
[countries]{.mark} and Russia and China all [went to war]{.mark} at the
same time, Africa, South America, and other [neutral regions would be
spared]{.mark} any kinetic damage. ]{.underline}

2\) Radiation

[[Radiation won\'t kill everyone]{.mark} because there aren\'t enough
weapons, and radiation from them would be concentrated in some areas and
wholly absent from other areas]{.underline}. [[Even in the worst]{.mark}
affected [areas]{.mark}, lethal radiation from [fallout would drop to
survivable levels within weeks]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Here it\'s worth noting that there is an inherent tradeoff between
length of halflife and energy released by radionuclides. The shorter the
half life the more energy will be released, and the longer the half life
the less energy. [The fallout products from modern nuclear weapons are
very lethal, but only for days to several weeks. ]{.underline}

Let\'s try the same calculation we used with kinetic damage, and see if
an attack aimed at optimizing fallout for killing everyone could
succeed.
Using [Nukemap](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=1000&lat=40.7648&lng=-73.9808&airburst=0&hob_ft=0&fallout=1&psi=20,5,1&zm=8) again,
I\'ll go with the fallout contour for 100 rads per hour. 400 rads is
thought too be enough to kill 50% of people, so 100 rads per hour is
likely to kill most all people not in some kind of shelter. We need to
switch to using a groundburst detonation rather than an airburst
detonation, because groundbursts create far more fallout. A 1mt ground
burst would create an area of about 8,000 km²  of \>100 rads per hour.
Okay, multiple that by 14,000 warheads, and we get 112 million km².
That\'s a lot! It\'s still less than the  510.1 million km² of earth\'s
land mass, but it\'s a lot more than the \~10.2 million km² of urban
space. Presumably this is enough to cover every human habitation, so in
principle, it might be possible to kill everyone with radiation from
existing nuclear weapons.

[In practice, [it would be]{.mark} almost [impossible to kill every
human via radiation]{.mark} with the existing nuclear arsenals, even if
they were targeted explicitly for this purpose]{.underline}. The first
reason is that [[fallout patterns are]{.mark} very [uneven]{.mark}.
After a ground burst, fallout is carried by the wind. [Some areas will
be]{.mark} hit bad and some areas will be [hardly affected]{.mark} by
fallout]{.underline}. [Even if most human population centers were
covered, a few areas would almost certainly escape.]{.underline}

[Two other things make extinction by radiation unlikely. Many
[countries]{.mark}, especially [in the southern hemisphere, are unlikely
to be affected by fallout]{.mark} much at all.]{.underline} [Since most
of these countries are likely to be neutral in a conflict, and not near
combatant countries, they should be relatively safe from fallout. While
fallout might travel hundreds of kms, it still won\'t reach places
separated by greater distances]{.underline}. [Fallout that reaches the
upper atmosphere will eventually fall back down, but usually after the
period of lethal radioactivity]{.underline}.  The other mitigating
factor is that [in typical nuclear war plans, ground bursts are usually
restricted to hardened targets, and air bursts are favored for
population and industry centers.]{.underline} This is because air bursts
maximize the size of the destructive pressure wave. [Air burst
detonations result in little lethal fallout reaching the ground, so
[populations not downwind of military targets would]{.mark} likely [be
safe]{.mark} from the worst of the radiological effects in a war
scenario.]{.underline}

[The final protection from extinction by radiation is simply large
amounts of mass between people and the radiation source, in other words,
fallout shelter]{.underline}s. [After several weeks, the radionuclides
in fallout from ground burst detonations will have decayed to the point
where humans can survive outside of shelters. [Many fallout shelters
exist]{.mark} in the world, and many [more could be made easily in a day
or two]{.mark} with a shovel, some ground, and some boards.  Even if
lethally radioactive fallout from ground bursts covered all population
centers, [many humans would]{.mark} still [survive in
shelters]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The risks of extinction from nuclear-weapon-induced-radiation wouldn\'t
be complete without discussing two factors: nuclear power plants and
radiological weapons. I\'m only going to cover these briefly, but they
both don\'t change the conclusions much.

Nuclear power plants could be targeted by nuclear weapons to create
large amounts of fallout with a longer half-life but less energy per
unit time. The main concern here is that nuclear power plants and spent
fuel sites contain a much greater \*mass\* of radioactive material than
nuclear missiles can carry. The danger comes primarily from spreading
the already very radiative spent or unspent nuclear fuel. The risk this
poses requires a longer analysis, but the short version is that [while
nuking a [nuclear power plant]{.mark} or stored fuel site would indeed
create some pretty long-lived fallout it would still be concentrated in
a relatively small area.]{.underline} [Fortunately, even a nuclear
detonation wouldn\'t spread the nuclear fuel more than several hundred
km at most. Having regions of countries covered in spent nuclear fuel
would be awful, but it [do]{.mark}es[n]{.mark}\'[t]{.mark} much [raise
the risk of extinction]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Radiological
weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiological_warfare) are nuclear
weapons designed to maximize the spread of lethal fallout rather than
destructive yield. The particular concern from the extinction
perspective is that they can be designed to create fallout that
continues to emit levels of radiation that can make an area
uninhabitable for months to years. These kind of radiological weapons
kill more slowly, but they still kill. In principle, radiological
weapons could be used to kill everyone on earth. However, in practice,
the same constraints that apply to standard nuclear weapons apply to
weapons optimized for long-lasting fallout, as well as some additional
constraints. 

[Radiological weapons wouldn\'t produce more fallout than standard
warheads, they would just produce fallout with different
characteristics]{.underline}. As a result the amount of radiological
weapons required to cover every part of earth\'s surface would be
massively expensive (likely as expensive as the largest existing nuclear
arsenals), and serve no military purpose. [Their inefficiency in
destruction and death compared to standard nuclear weapons is probably
why [radiological weapons have]{.mark} never been developed or deployed
in large numbers]{.underline}. [This makes them an ongoing theoretical
concern, but [not an existential risk]{.mark} in the immediate
future.]{.underline} A [concerning
development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status-6_Oceanic_Multipurpose_System) is
Russia\'s claim to have developed a large-yield (100mt) submersible
nuclear weapon with the suggestion that it could be used as a
radiological weapon, but even if this is true, it\'s unlikely to be
deployed in large numbers.

3\) Climate alteration

The bulk of the risk of human extinction from nuclear weapons come from
risks of catastrophic climate change, nuclear winter, due to secondary
effects from nuclear detonations. [However, [even in]{.mark} most
[full-scale]{.mark} nuclear exchange [scenarios]{.mark}, the resulting
[climate effects are unlikely to cause]{.mark} human
[extinction]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Reasons for this:

a\) [Under scenarios where a severe nuclear winter occurs as described
by Robock et al, some human populations would likely
survive.\]{.underline}
b) The [Robock group's models are probably overestimating the
risk]{.underline}\
c) [Nuclear war planners are aware of nuclear winter risks and can
incorporate these risks into their targeting plans]{.underline}

Before diving into each subject, it's worth understanding the background
of nuclear winter research. In the 1980s a group of atmospheric
scientists proposed the hypothesis that a nuclear war would result in
massive firestorms in burning cities, which would loft particles high
into the atmosphere and cause catastrophic cooling that would last for
years. Many found it alarming that such an effect could be possible and
go unnoticed for decades while the risk existed. Some scientists also
thought the proposed effect was too strong, or unlikely to occur at all.
Until a few years ago, if you looked only at peer reviewed literature
you would only find papers forecasting severe nuclear winter effects in
the event of a nuclear war. Understandably, [many people assumed that
this was the scientific consensus. Unfortunately, this misrepresented
the scientific community's state of uncertainty about the risks of
nuclear war. [There have only ever been a small numbers of
papers]{.mark} published about this topic (\<15 probably), mostly [from
one group of researchers]{.mark}, despite the topic being one of
existential importance.\]{.underline}
\
[I'm very glad Robock, Toon, and others have spent much of their careers
studying nuclear winter effects, and their models are useful in
estimating potential climate change caused by nuclear war. However, I've
become less convinced over time the Robock model is largely
correct]{.underline}. See section B below for why I've changed my mind.
However, I'm quite uncertain the probability of strong cooling effects
from nuclear war, and am still quite concerned about the potential for
severe cooling, even if the risk of extinction from such events is
small.

A:  [Under scenarios where a severe nuclear winter occurs as described
by Robock et al, some [human]{.mark} population[s]{.mark} [would likely
survive.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The latest and most detailed model of potential cooling effects from a
fullscale nuclear exchange comes from, Robock et al.,  "Nuclear winter
revisited with a modern climate model and current nuclear arsenals:
Still catastrophic consequences"
found [here](http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/RobockNW2006JD008235.pdf).\
\
The effects from this model are severe. In the 150Tg case, after a year,
summer temperatures in the Northern hemisphere are 10-30 degrees C
cooler. The effects are less severe at the equator (5 degrees C), but
basically all places in the world are affected. The most likely outcome
is that most people starve to death. Many would freeze too, but
starvation is likely the greatest risk. [Even in this model, it appears
that [in equatorial regions]{.mark}, some [farming would still be
possible]{.mark}, enough for some populations to survive. After a 10-15
years, agriculture in most of the world would be possible at reduced
capacity]{.underline}.

[Carl Shulman asked one of the authors of this paper, Luke Oman, his
[probability that]{.mark} the 150Tg [nuclear]{.mark} [winter]{.mark}
scenario discussed in the paper [would result in]{.mark} human
[extinction]{.mark}, [the answer he
gave](https://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/11/nuclear-winter-and-human-extinction-qa-with-luke-oman.html) was
"in the range of 1 in 10,000 to [1 in 100,000]{.mark}."]{.underline}
This strikes me as quite plausible, though one expert opinion is no
substitute for a deep analysis. The [Q&A with
Oman](https://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/11/nuclear-winter-and-human-extinction-qa-with-luke-oman.html) contains
his reasoning for this assessment.

Two different analyses are required to calculate the chances of human
extinction from nuclear winter. The first is the analysis of the climate
change that could result from a nuclear war, and the second is the
adaptive capacity of human groups to these climate changes. I have not
seen an in depth analysis of the latter, but I believe such an
assessment would be worthwhile.  \
\
My own guess is that humans are capable of surviving far more severe
climate shifts than those projected in nuclear winter scenarios. Humans
are more robust than most any other mammal to drastic changes in
temperature, as evidenced by our global range, even in pre-historic
times. While a loss of most agriculture would likely kill most people on
earth, modern technology would enable some populations to survive. Great
stores of food currently exist in the world, and it is l likely that
some of these would be seized and protected by small groups, providing
enough food to last for years. While even such populations with food
stores wouldn't have enough to survive for 10-15 years, such food stores
would give groups time to adapt to new food sources. The
organization [ALLFED](https://allfed.info/) has explored a number of
alternative food sources that could keep populations alive in the event
of a nuclear war or other large solar disruption, and I expect great
necessity to drive the discovery of even more in the event of such a
disaster.

B: The Robock group's [[models are]{.mark} probably [overestimating the
risk]{.mark}]{.underline}

The nuclear winter model at its simplest: Nuclear detonations → Fires in
cities → Firestorms in cities → Lofted black carbon into the upper
atmosphere → black carbon persists in upper atmosphere, reflecting
sunlight and causes massive cooling

Each step is required in order for the effect to occur. [If nuclear war
causes massive fires in cities but does not lead to firestorms that loft
particles, then no long term cooling is going to occur]{.underline}.
Some of these steps are easier to model than others. Based on my reading
of the literature, the greatest uncertainties involve the dynamics of
cities burning after a nuclear attack, and whether the conditions would
produce firestorms sufficient to loft large numbers of particles high
enough in the atmosphere to persist for years.

We're finally beginning to see some healthy debate about some of these
questions in the scientific literature. Alan Robock's group published a
paper in 2007 that found significant cooling effects even from a
relatively limited regional war. [A group from Los Alamos,
[Reisner]{.mark} et al, [published a
paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017JD027331) in
2018 that reexamined some of the assumptions that went into [Robock et
al](https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/7/2003/2007/acp-7-2003-2007.pdf)'s
model, and [concluded]{.mark} that [global cooling was unlikely]{.mark}
in such a scenario]{.underline}. Robock et
al. [responded](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2019JD030777),
and Reisner et al responded to
the [response](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2019JD031281).
Both authors bring up good points, but I find Reisner's position more
compelling. This back and forth is worth reading for those who want to
investigate deeper. Unfortunately Reisner's group has not published an
analysis on potential cooling effects from a modern full scale nuclear
exchange, rather than a limited regional exchange. Even so, it's not
hard to extrapolate that Reisner's model would result in far less
cooling than Robock's model in the equivalent situation.

**Wallace-Wells 17**, 7-9-2017, David Wallace-Wells is an American

**[I. '[Doomsday']{.mark}]{.underline}**

Peering beyond scientific reticence.

It is, I promise, worse than you think[. If your anxiety about global
warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely
scratching the surface of what terrors are possible, even within the
lifetime of a teenager today]{.underline}. And yet the swelling seas ---
and the cities they will drown --- have so dominated the picture of
global warming, and so overwhelmed our capacity for climate panic, that
they have occluded our perception of other threats, many much closer at
hand. [[Rising oceans are bad]{.mark}, in fact very bad; [but fleeing
the coastline will not be enough.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Indeed, absent a significant adjustment to how billions of humans
conduct their lives, parts of the Earth will likely become close to
uninhabitable, and other parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the
end of this century.

[[Even when we train our eyes on climate change]{.mark}, [we are unable
to comprehend its scope]{.mark}. This past winter, a string of days 60
and 70 degrees warmer than normal baked the North Pole, melting the
permafrost that encased Norway's Svalbard seed vault --- a global food
bank nicknamed "Doomsday," designed to ensure that our agriculture
survives any catastrophe, and which appeared to have been flooded by
climate change less than ten years after being built.]{.underline}

The Doomsday vault is fine, for now: The structure has been secured and
the seeds are safe. But treating the episode as a parable of impending
flooding missed the more important news. [Until recently, permafrost was
not a major concern of climate scientists, because, as the name
suggests, it was soil that stayed permanently frozen. But [Arctic
permafrost contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon]{.mark}, more than twice
as much as is currently suspended in the Earth's atmosphere. When it
thaws and is released, [that carbon may evaporate as methane]{.mark},
which is 34 times as powerful a greenhouse-gas warming blanket as carbon
dioxide]{.underline} when judged on the timescale of a century; when
judged on the timescale of two decades, [[it is 86 times as
powerful]{.mark}. In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost,
twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the
planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting
moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming
power 86 times over.]{.underline}

Maybe you know that already --- there are alarming stories in the news
every day, like those, last month, that seemed to suggest satellite
data [showed ](https://www.carbonbrief.org/major-correction-to-satellite-data-shows-140-faster-warming-since-1998)the
globe warming since 1998 more than twice as fast as scientists had
thought (in fact, the underlying story was considerably less alarming
than the headlines). Or the news from Antarctica this past May, when
a [crack ](http://www.newsweek.com/antarctica-ice-shelf-larsen-c-crack-grown-618676)in
an ice shelf grew 11 miles in six days, then kept going; the break now
has just three miles to go --- by the time you read this, [it may
already have met the open
water](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/trillion-ton-iceberg-breaks-off-antarctic-ice-shelf.html),
where it will drop into the sea one of the biggest icebergs ever, a
process known poetically as "calving."

[But [no matter how well-informed you are, you are]{.mark} surely [not
alarmed enough.]{.mark} Over the past decades, our culture has gone
apocalyptic with zombie movies and [Mad
Max dystopias](http://www.vulture.com/2016/07/the-present-worse-than-fictional-dystopias.html),
perhaps the collective result of displaced climate anxiety, and yet when
it comes to contemplating real-world warming dangers, [we suffer from
a]{.mark}n incredible [failure of imagination]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
reasons for that are many: [the timid language of scientific
probabilities, which the climatologist]{.underline} [James Hansen once
called **"scientific reticence"** in a paper chastising
[scientists]{.mark} for editing their own observations so
conscientiously that they [fail]{.mark}ed [to communicate how dire the
threat]{.mark} really [was]{.mark}]{.underline}; the fact that [[the
country is dominated by]{.mark} a group of]{.underline}
[**[technocrats]{.mark}** [who]{.mark} believe any problem can be solved
and an opposing culture that [do]{.mark}es[n't]{.mark} even [see warming
as a problem]{.mark} worth addressing]{.underline}; [the way that
climate denialism has made scientists even more cautious in offering
speculative warnings]{.underline}; the simple speed of change and, also,
its slowness, such that we are only seeing effects now of warming from
decades past; [our **uncertainty about uncertainty**, which the climate
writer Naomi Oreskes in particular has suggested stops us from preparing
as though anything worse than a median outcome were even
possible]{.underline}; [the way we assume climate change will hit
**hardest elsewhere, not everywhere**;]{.underline} the smallness (two
degrees) and largeness (1.8 trillion tons) and abstractness (400 parts
per million) of the numbers; the discomfort of considering a problem
that is very difficult, if not impossible, to solve; [[the]{.mark}
altogether [incomprehensible scale]{.mark} of that problem, which
[amounts to]{.mark} the prospect of **[our own
annihilation]{.mark};**]{.underline} simple fear. [But aversion arising
from fear is a form of denial, too.]{.underline}

In between scientific reticence and science fiction is science itself.
[[This article is the result of dozens of interviews and exchanges with
climatologists and researchers in related fields and reflects **hundreds
of scientific papers**]{.mark} on the subject of climate
change.]{.underline} What follows is not a series of predictions of what
will happen --- that will be determined in large part by the
much-less-certain science of human response. Instead, it [is a portrait
of our best understanding of where the planet is heading absent
aggressive action]{.underline}. It is unlikely that all of these warming
scenarios will be fully realized, largely because the devastation along
the way will shake our complacency. But those scenarios, and not the
present climate, are the baseline. [In fact, they are **our
schedule.**]{.underline}

The present tense of climate change --- the destruction we've already
baked into our future --- is horrifying enough. Most people talk as if
Miami and Bangladesh still have a chance of surviving; most of the
scientists I spoke with assume we'll lose them within the century, even
if we stop burning fossil fuel in the next decade. Two degrees of
warming used to be considered the threshold of catastrophe: tens of
millions of climate refugees unleashed upon an unprepared world. Now two
degrees is our goal, per the Paris climate accords, and experts give us
only slim odds of hitting it. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change issues serial reports, often called the "gold standard"
of climate research; the most recent one projects us to hit four degrees
of warming by the beginning of the next century, should we stay the
present course. But that's just a median projection. [The upper end of
the probability curve runs as high as **eight degrees** --- and the
authors still haven't figured out how to deal with that permafrost
melt.]{.underline} [The [IPCC reports]{.mark} also **[don't]{.mark}
fully [account for]{.mark}** [the albedo effect]{.mark}]{.underline}
(less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight, hence more
warming); [[more cloud cover]{.underline}]{.mark} (which traps heat[);
or the [dieback of]{.mark} forests and other [flora]{.mark}]{.underline}
(which extract carbon from the atmosphere). [[Each]{.mark} of these
promises to **[accelerate warming]{.mark}**, a]{.underline}nd the
history of the planet shows that [[temperature can shift]{.mark} as much
as [five degrees]{.mark} Celsius [within thirteen
years]{.mark}.]{.underline} The last time the planet was even four
degrees warmer, Peter Brannen points out in [The Ends of the
World](https://www.amazon.com/Ends-World-Apocalypses-Understand-Extinctions/dp/0062364804?ots=1&slotNum=0&imprToken=cac0faa7-65fb-2f9d-d60&ascsubtag=%5b%5din%5bp%5dcj4u5jzvo0000osy64knayino%5bi%5dZZzYuL%5bu%5d1%5bt%5dw%5bd%5dD%5bz%5dm),
his new history of the planet's major extinction events, the oceans were
hundreds of feet higher.\*

[The Earth has experienced five [mass extinctions]{.mark} before the one
we are living through now]{.underline}, each so complete a slate-wiping
of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary
clock, and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best
analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into. Unless you
are a teenager, you probably read in your high-school textbooks that
these extinctions were the result of asteroids. In fact, all but the one
that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by
greenhouse gas. The most notorious was 252 million years ago; [it [began
when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees]{.mark}, accelerated when
that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic, and ended
with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead.]{.underline} [[We are]{.mark}
currently [adding]{.mark} [carbon]{.mark} to the atmosphere at a
**considerably faster rate**; by most estimates, [**at least ten times**
faster]{.mark}.]{.underline} The rate is accelerating. This is what
Stephen Hawking had in mind when [he
said](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/05/02/tomorrows-world-returns-bbc-startling-warning-stephen-hawking/),
this spring, that the species needs to colonize other planets in the
next century to survive, and what drove Elon Musk, last month,
to [unveil ](http://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-mars-spacex-martian-city-625994)his
plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years. These are
nonspecialists, of course, and probably as inclined to irrational panic
as you or I. But the many sober-minded scientists I interviewed over the
past several months --- the most credentialed and tenured in the field,
few of them inclined to alarmism and many advisers to the IPCC who
nevertheless criticize its conservatism --- have quietly reached an
apocalyptic conclusion, too[: [**No plausible program of emissions
reductions** alone can prevent climate disaster.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Over the past few decades, the term ["Anthropocene" has climbed out of
academic discourse and into the popular
imagination](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/06/anthropocene-debate.html) ---
a name given to the geologic era we live in now, and a way to signal
that it is a new era, defined on the wall chart of deep history by human
intervention. One problem with the term is that it implies a conquest of
nature (and even echoes the biblical "dominion"). [And however sanguine
you might be about the proposition that we have already ravaged the
**natural world**,]{.underline} which we surely have, it is another
thing entirely to consider the possibility that we have only provoked
it, [engineering first in ignorance and then in denial a
[climate]{.mark} system that [will]{.mark} now **[go to war with
us]{.mark}** for many centuries, perhaps [until **it destroys
us**]{.mark}.]{.underline} That is what Wallace Smith Broecker, the
avuncular oceanographer who coined the term "global warming," means when
he calls the planet an "angry beast." You could also go with "war
machine." Each day we arm it more.

**[II. [Heat Death]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The bahraining of New York.

Humans, like all mammals, are heat engines; [surviving means having to
continually cool off, like panting dogs.]{.underline} For that, [the
temperature needs to be low enough for the air to act as a kind of
refrigerant, drawing heat off the skin so the engine can keep
pumping]{.underline}. [At seven degrees of warming, that would become
impossible for large portions of the planet's equatorial
band,]{.underline} and especially the tropics, where humidity adds to
the problem; in the jungles of Costa Rica, for instance, where humidity
routinely tops 90 percent, [[simply moving around]{.mark} outside when
it's over **105 degrees Fahrenheit** [would be lethal. And]{.mark} the
effect would be [fast]{.mark}:]{.underline} Within a few hours, a human
body would be cooked to death from both inside and out.

Climate-change skeptics point out that the planet has warmed and cooled
many times before, but the climate window that has allowed for human
life is very narrow, even by the standards of planetary history. [At
**11 or 12** degrees of warming, [more than half the world's
population]{.mark}, as distributed today, [would **die of direct
heat**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Things almost certainly won't get that
hot this century, though models of unabated emissions do bring us that
far eventually. This century, and especially in the tropics, the pain
points will pinch much more quickly even than an increase of seven
degrees. The key factor is something called wet-bulb temperature, which
is a term of measurement as home-laboratory-kit as it sounds: the heat
registered on a thermometer wrapped in a damp sock as it's swung around
in the air (since the moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in
dry air, this single number reflects both heat and humidity). At
present, most regions reach a wet-bulb maximum of 26 or 27 degrees
Celsius; the true red line for habitability is 35 degrees. What is
called heat stress comes much sooner.

Actually, we're about there already. Since 1980, the planet has
experienced a 50-fold increase in the number of places experiencing
dangerous or extreme heat; a bigger increase is to come. The five
warmest summers in Europe since 1500 have all occurred since 2002, and
soon, [the IPCC warns, simply being outdoors that time of year will be
unhealthy for much of the globe.]{.underline} Even if we meet the Paris
goals of two degrees warming, cities like Karachi and Kolkata will
become close to uninhabitable, annually encountering deadly heat waves
like those that crippled them in 2015. At four degrees, the deadly
European heat wave of 2003, which killed as many as 2,000 people a day,
will be a normal summer. At six, according to an assessment focused only
on effects within the U.S. from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the
lower Mississippi Valley, and everybody in the country east of the
Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone, anywhere, in the
world today. As Joseph Romm has put it in his authoritative
primer [Climate Change: What Everyone Needs to
Know](https://www.amazon.com/Climate-Change-Everyone-Needs-Know%C2%AE/dp/0190250178?ots=1&slotNum=1&imprToken=cac0faa7-65fb-2f9d-d60&ascsubtag=%5b%5din%5bp%5dcj4u5jzvo0000osy64knayino%5bi%5dhFf9XP%5bu%5d1%5bt%5dw%5bd%5dD%5bz%5dm), heat
stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain, one of
the planet's hottest spots, and the temperature in Bahrain "would induce
hyperthermia in even sleeping humans." The high-end IPCC estimate,
remember, is two degrees warmer still. By the end of the century, the
World Bank has estimated, the coolest months in tropical South America,
Africa, and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months
at the end of the 20th century. [[Air-conditioning]{.mark} can help but
[will]{.mark} ultimately [only add to the]{.mark} carbon
[problem]{.mark}]{.underline}; plus, the climate-controlled malls of the
Arab emirates aside, [it is not remotely plausible to wholesale
air-condition all the hottest parts of the world, many of them also the
poorest]{.underline}. And indeed, the crisis will be most dramatic
across the Middle East and Persian Gulf, where in 2015 the heat index
registered temperatures as high as 163 degrees Fahrenheit. As soon as
several decades from now, the hajj will become physically impossible for
the 2 million Muslims who make the pilgrimage each year.

It is not just the hajj, and it is not just Mecca; [[heat is **already
killing us**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} In the sugarcane region of El
Salvador, as much as one-fifth of the population has [chronic **[kidney
disease]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including over a quarter of the men,
[[the]{.mark} presumed [result of dehydration]{.mark}]{.underline} from
working the fields they were able to comfortably harvest as recently as
two decades ago. [With dialysis]{.underline}, which is expensive, [those
with kidney failure can expect to live five years]{.underline}; [without
it, life expectancy is in the **weeks**]{.underline}. Of course, [heat
stress promises to pummel us in places other than our kidneys,
too.]{.underline} As I type that sentence, in the California desert in
mid-June, it is 121 degrees outside my door. It is not a record high.

**[III. [The End of Food]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Praying for cornfields in the tundra.

Climates differ and plants vary, but [the basic rule for staple cereal
crops grown at optimal temperature is that for [every degree of
warming]{.mark}, [yields]{.mark} decline [by]{.mark} 10
percent]{.underline}. [Some estimates run [as high as]{.mark} 15 or even
[17 percent]{.mark}.]{.underline} Which means that [if the planet is
five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may have as many as 50
percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain to give
them]{.underline}. And proteins are worse: It takes 16 calories of grain
to produce just a single calorie of hamburger meat, butchered from a cow
that spent its life polluting the climate with methane farts.

Pollyannaish plant physiologists will point out that the cereal-crop
math applies only to those regions already at peak growing temperature,
and they are right --- theoretically, a warmer climate will make it
easier to grow corn in Greenland. But as the pathbreaking work by
Rosamond Naylor and David Battisti has shown, [the tropics are already
too hot to efficiently grow grain, and those places [where grain
is]{.mark} produced [today]{.mark} [are]{.mark} already [at optimal
growing temperature]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [which means [**even a
small warming** will **push them down the slope**]{.mark} of declining
productivity]{.underline}. And [you can't easily move croplands north a
few hundred miles, because yields in [places like remote Canada and
Russia are **limited by the quality of soil**]{.mark}
there]{.underline}; [it takes **many centuries** for the planet **to
produce optimally fertile dirt**]{.underline}.

[[Drought might be an even bigger problem]{.mark} than
hea]{.underline}t, with some of the world's most arable land turning
quickly to desert. Precipitation is notoriously hard to model, yet
[predictions for later this century are basically
unanimous]{.underline}: [[**unprecedented droughts** nearly everywhere
food is]{.mark} today [produced]{.mark}. [By 2080]{.mark}]{.underline},
without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be in
permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American dust bowl ever
was. [The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of the rest of
the **Middle East;**]{.underline} some of t[he most densely populated
parts of Australia, Africa, and South America; and the **breadbasket
regions** of China.]{.underline} [[No]{.mark}ne of these
[places]{.mark}, [which]{.mark} today [supply]{.mark} much of the
world's [food, will be reliable sources]{.mark} of any]{.underline}. As
for the original dust bowl: The droughts in the American plains and
Southwest would not just be worse than in the 1930s, a 2015 NASA
study [predicted](https://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/february/nasa-study-finds-carbon-emissions-could-dramatically-increase-risk-of-us),
but worse than any droughts in a thousand years --- and that includes
those that struck between 1100 and 1300, which "dried up all the rivers
East of the Sierra Nevada mountains" and may have been responsible for
the death of the Anasazi civilization.

Remember, [[we do not live in a world without hunger as]{.mark} it
[is]{.mark}.]{.underline} Far from it: Most estimates put the number of
undernourished at 800 million globally. In case you haven't heard, this
spring has already brought an unprecedented quadruple famine to Africa
and the Middle East; [the U.N. has warned that separate starvation
events in Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria, and Yemen could kill **20
million this year alone**]{.underline}.

**[IV. [Climate Plagues]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[What happens when the]{.underline} **[bubonic ice melts]{.underline}**?

Rock, in the right spot, is a record of planetary history, eras as long
as millions of years flattened by the forces of geological time into
strata with amplitudes of just inches, or just an inch, or even less.
Ice works that way, too, as a climate ledger, but it is also frozen
history, some of which can be reanimated when unfrozen. [There are now,
trapped in Arctic ice, [**diseases** that have **not
circulated**]{.mark} in the air [for **millions of
years**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- in some cases[, since before humans
were around to encounter them]{.underline}. [Which means [our immune
systems **would have no idea** how to fight back when]{.mark} those
[**prehistoric plagues** emerge from the ice.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Arctic also stores terrifying bugs from more recent times. In
Alaska, already, [[researchers]{.mark} have [discovered]{.mark} remnants
of [the 1918 flu]{.mark} that infected as many as 500 million and killed
as many as **100 million**]{.underline} --- about 5 percent of the
world's population and almost six times as many as had died in the world
war for which the pandemic served as a kind of gruesome capstone. As the
BBC [reported ](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170504-there-are-diseases-hidden-in-ice-and-they-are-waking-up)in
May, [scientists suspect [smallpox and the bubonic plague are trapped in
Siberian ice]{.mark}, too ---]{.underline} an abridged history of
devastating human sickness, left out like egg salad in the Arctic sun.

Experts caution that many of these organisms won't actually survive the
thaw and point to the fastidious lab conditions under which they have
already reanimated several of them --- the 32,000-year-old
"extremophile" bacteria revived in 2005, an 8 million-year-old bug
brought back to life in 2007, the 3.5 million--year--old one a Russian
scientist [self-injected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv0_Cu0FcPA) just
out of curiosity --- to suggest that those are necessary conditions for
the return of such ancient plagues. But already last year, [a boy was
killed and 20 others infected by anthrax released when retreating
permafrost exposed the frozen carcass of a reindeer killed by the
bacteria at least 75 years earlier;]{.underline} 2,000 present-day
[reindeer were infected, too, carrying and spreading the disease
**beyond the tundra.**]{.underline}

[What concerns epidemiologists more than ancient diseases are [existing
scourge]{.mark}s relocated, rewired, or even [re**-evolved by
warming**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The first effect is
geographical. Before the early-modern period, when adventuring sailboats
accelerated the mixing of peoples and their bugs, human provinciality
was a guard against pandemic. Today, even with globalization and the
enormous intermingling of human populations, our ecosystems are mostly
stable, and this functions as another limit, but [global [warming
will]{.mark} scramble those ecosystems and [help disease
trespass]{.mark} those [limits]{.mark} as surely as Cortés
did]{.underline}. You don't worry much about dengue or malaria if you
are living in Maine or France. But as the tropics creep northward and
mosquitoes migrate with them, you will. You didn't much worry about Zika
a couple of years ago, either.

As it happens, [Zika may also be a good
model](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/zika-virus-gmo-mosquitoes.html) of
the second worrying effect --- disease mutation. One reason you hadn't
heard about Zika until recently is that it had been trapped in Uganda;
another is that it did not, until recently, appear to cause birth
defects. Scientists still don't entirely understand what happened, or
what they missed. But there are things we do know for sure about how
climate affects some diseases: [[Malaria]{.mark}, for instance, thrives
in hotter regions not just because the mosquitoes that carry it do, too,
but because for [every degree increase in temperature]{.mark}, the
parasite **[reproduces ten times faster.]{.mark}** Which is one reason
that the World Bank estimates that by 2050, **5.2 billion people** will
be reckoning with it.]{.underline}

**[V. [Unbreathable Air]{.mark}]{.underline}**

A rolling death smog that suffocates millions.

[Our lungs need oxygen, but that is only a fraction of what we
breathe]{.underline}. The fraction of carbon dioxide is growing: It just
crossed 400 parts per million, and high-end estimates extrapolating from
current trends suggest it will hit 1,000 ppm by 2100. At that
concentration, compared to the air we breathe now, human cognitive
ability declines by 21 percent.

[Other stuff in the hotter air is even scarier, with [small increases in
pollution capable of shortening life spans]{.mark} by ten
years]{.underline}. [The warmer the planet gets, the more ozone forms,
and by mid-century, Americans will likely suffer a 70 percent increase
in unhealthy ozone smog]{.underline}, the National Center for
Atmospheric Research has projected. [By 2090, as many as 2 billion
people globally will be breathing air above the WHO "safe"
level]{.underline}; one paper last month showed that, among other
effects, a pregnant mother's **[exposure to ozone raises the child's
risk of autism]{.underline}** (as much as tenfold, combined with other
environmental factors). Which does make you think again about the autism
epidemic in West Hollywood.

Already, [more than 10,000 people die each day from the small particles
emitted from fossil-fuel burning;]{.underline} each year, 339,000 people
die from wildfire smoke, in part because climate change has extended
forest-fire season (in the U.S., it's increased by 78 days since 1970).
[By 2050,]{.underline} according to the [U.S. Forest
Service](https://www.usda.gov/oce/climate_change/effects_2012/FS_Climate1114%20opt.pdf),
[[wildfires will be twice as destructive as they are
today]{.underline}]{.mark}; in some places, [[the area burned could grow
fivefold.]{.underline}]{.mark} What worries people even more is the
effect that would have on emissions, especially when the fires ravage
forests arising out of peat. [Peatland fires in Indonesia in 1997, for
instance, added to the global CO2 release by up to 40 percent, [and more
burning only means **more warming only means more**
]{.mark}**burning**]{.underline}. [There is also the terrifying
possibility that rain forests like the Amazon]{.underline}, which in
2010 suffered its second "hundred-year drought" in the space of five
years, [could dry out enough to become vulnerable to these kinds of
devastating, rolling forest fire]{.underline}s --- which would not only
expel enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere but also shrink the
size of the forest. [That is especially bad because the Amazon alone
provides 20 percent of our oxygen]{.underline}.

Then there are the more familiar forms of pollution. In 2013, melting
Arctic ice remodeled Asian weather patterns, depriving industrial China
of the natural ventilation systems it had come to depend on, which
blanketed much of the country's north in an unbreathable smog. Literally
unbreathable. A metric called the Air Quality Index categorizes the
risks and tops out at the 301-to-500 range, warning of "serious
aggravation of heart or lung disease and premature mortality in persons
with cardiopulmonary disease and the elderly" and, for all others,
"serious risk of respiratory effects"; at that level, "everyone should
avoid all outdoor exertion." The Chinese "airpocalypse" of 2013 peaked
at what would have been an Air Quality Index of over 800. That year,
smog was responsible for a third of all deaths in the country.

**[VI. [Perpetual War]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[The violence baked into heat.]{.underline}

Climatologists are very careful when talking about Syria. They want you
to know that while climate change did produce a drought that contributed
to civil war, it is not exactly fair to say that the conflict is the
result of warming; next door, for instance, Lebanon suffered the same
crop failures. But researchers like Marshall Burke and Solomon Hsiang
have managed to quantify some of the non-obvious relationships between
temperature and violence: [[For **every half-degree of
warming**]{.mark}, they say, [societies will se]{.mark}e between [a **10
and 20 percent increase** in the likelihood of armed
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In climate science, nothing is
simple, but the arithmetic is harrowing: [A planet five degrees warmer
would have at least half again as many wars as we do today. Overall,
social [conflict could more than **double** ]{.mark}**this
century.**]{.underline}

This is one reason that, as nearly every climate scientist I spoke to
pointed out, the U.S. military is obsessed with climate change: The
drowning of all American Navy bases by sea-level rise is trouble enough,
but being the world's policeman is quite a bit harder when the crime
rate doubles. Of course, it's not just Syria where climate has
contributed to conflict. [Some speculate that the [elevated level of
strife across the Middle East]{.mark} over the past generation
[reflects]{.mark} the pressures of [global warming]{.mark}]{.underline}
--- a hypothesis all the more cruel considering that warming began
accelerating when the industrialized world extracted and then burned the
region's oil.

[What accounts for the relationship between climate and conflict? Some
of it comes down to agriculture and economics; a lot has to do with
forced migration]{.underline}, already at a record high, with at least
65 million displaced people wandering the planet right now. But there is
also the simple fact of individual irritability. Heat increases
municipal crime rates, and swearing on social media, and the likelihood
that a major-league pitcher, coming to the mound after his teammate has
been hit by a pitch, will hit an opposing batter in retaliation. And the
arrival of air-conditioning in the developed world, in the middle of the
past century, did little to solve the problem of the summer crime wave.

**[VII. Permanent Economic Collapse]{.underline}**

Dismal capitalism in a half-poorer world.

[[The]{.mark} murmuring [mantra of]{.mark} global
[neoliberalism]{.mark},]{.underline} which prevailed between the end of
the Cold War and the onset of the Great Recession, [[is that economic
growth would save us]{.mark} from anything and everything]{.underline}.\
But in the aftermath of the 2008 crash, a growing number of historians
studying what they call "[fossil capitalism" have begun to suggest that
the entire history of swift economic growth,]{.underline} which began
somewhat suddenly in the 18th century, is [not the result of innovation
or trade or the dynamics of global capitalism but simply our discovery
of fossil fuels and all their raw power]{.underline} --- [a onetime
injection of new "value" into a system that had previously been
characterized by global subsistence living]{.underline}. Before fossil
fuels, nobody lived better than their parents or grandparents or
ancestors from 500 years before, except in the immediate aftermath of a
great plague like the Black Death, which allowed the lucky survivors to
gobble up the resources liberated by mass graves. After we've burned all
the fossil fuels, these scholars suggest, perhaps we will return to a
"steady state" global economy. Of course, [[that onetime injection has a
devastating]{.mark} long-term [cost]{.mark}: climate
change.]{.underline}

The most exciting research on the economics of warming has also come
from Hsiang and his colleagues, who are not historians of fossil
capitalism but who offer some very bleak analysis of their own: [Every
degree Celsius of warming costs, on average, 1.2 percent of
GDP]{.underline} (an enormous number, considering we count growth in the
low single digits as "strong"). This is the sterling work in the field,
and their median projection is for a 23 percent loss in per capita
earning globally by the end of this century (resulting from changes in
agriculture, crime, storms, energy, mortality, and labor).\
Tracing the shape of the probability curve is even scarier: [There is a
12 percent chance that [climate change will reduce **global output by
more than 50 percent**]{.mark} by 2100, they say, and a 51 percent
chance that it lowers per capita **GDP by 20 percent** or more by then,
unless emissions decline]{.underline}. By comparison, [the Great
Recession lowered global GDP by about 6 percent]{.underline}, in a
onetime shock; Hsiang and his colleagues estimate a one-in-eight chance
of an ongoing and irreversible effect by the end of the century that is
eight times worse.

The scale of that economic devastation is hard to comprehend, but you
can start by imagining what the world would look like today with an
economy half as big, which would produce only half as much value,
generating only half as much to offer the workers of the world. It makes
the grounding of flights out of heat-stricken Phoenix last month seem
like pathetically small economic potatoes. And, among other things, [it
makes the idea of postponing government action on reducing emissions and
[relying]{.mark} solely [on **growth and technology to solve the
problem** an **absurd business
calculation**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}\
Every round-trip ticket on flights from New York to London, keep in
mind, costs the Arctic three more square meters of ice.

**[VIII. [Poisoned Oceans]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Sulfide burps off the skeleton coast.

[That [the sea will become a killer]{.mark} is a given]{.underline}.
Barring a radical reduction of emissions, we will see at least four feet
of sea-level rise and possibly ten by the end of the century. A third of
the world's major cities are on the coast, not to mention its power
plants, ports, navy bases, farmlands, fisheries, river deltas,
marshlands, and rice-paddy empires, and even those above ten feet will
flood much more easily, and much more regularly, if the water gets that
high. At least 600 million people live within ten meters of sea level
today.

But the drowning of those homelands is just the start. [At present, more
than a third of the world's carbon is sucked up by the
ocean]{.underline}s --- thank God, or else we'd have that much more
warming already. [But the result is what's called "**[ocean
acidification,"]{.mark}** which, on its own, [may add]{.mark} a half a
degree [to warming]{.mark} this century]{.underline}. It is also already
burning through the planet's water basins --- you may remember these as
the place where life arose in the first place. You have probably heard
of "coral bleaching" --- that is, coral dying --- which is very bad
news, because [reefs support as much as a quarter of all marine life and
supply food for half a billion people]{.underline}. [[Ocean
acidification will fry fish populations]{.mark} directly]{.underline},
too, though scientists aren't yet sure how to predict the effects on the
stuff we haul out of the ocean to eat; they do know that in acid waters,
oysters and mussels will struggle to grow their shells, and that when
the pH of human blood drops as much as the oceans' pH has over the past
generation, it induces seizures, comas, and sudden death.

That isn't all that ocean acidification can do. [[Carbon absorption can
initiate a **feedback loop**]{.mark} in which underoxygenated waters
breed different kinds of microbes that turn the water still more
"anoxic," first in deep ocean "dead zones," then gradually up toward the
surfac]{.underline}e. There, [[the]{.mark} [small fish die]{.mark} out,
unable to breathe, which means oxygen-eating bacteria thrive, [and **the
feedback loop doubles back**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This process, in
which [dead zones grow like cancers, choking off marine life and wiping
out fisheries, is already quite advanced in parts of the Gulf of Mexico
and just off Namibia]{.underline}, [where hydrogen sulfide is bubbling
out of the sea along a thousand-mile stretch of land known as the
"Skeleton Coast]{.underline}." The name originally referred to the
detritus of the whaling industry, but today it's more apt than ever.
[Hydrogen sulfide is so toxic that evolution has trained us to recognize
the tiniest, safest traces of it, which is why our noses are so
exquisitely skilled at registering flatulence. Hydrogen sulfide is also
the thing that finally did us in that time 97 percent of all life on
Earth died, once all the feedback loops had been triggered and the
circulating jet streams of a warmed ocean ground to a halt --- it's the
planet's preferred gas for a **natural \*catastrophe\*
~~holocaust.~~**]{.underline} Gradually, the ocean's dead zones spread,
killing off marine species that had dominated the oceans for hundreds of
millions of years, and [[the]{.mark} [gas]{.mark} the inert waters gave
off into the atmosphere [poisoned everything on land]{.mark}. Plants,
too. [It was millions of years before the oceans
recovered.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[IX. The Great Filter]{.underline}**

Our present eeriness cannot last.

So why can't we see it? In his recent book-length essay [The Great
Derangement](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Derangement-Climate-Unthinkable-Lectures/dp/022632303X?ots=1&slotNum=2&imprToken=cac0faa7-65fb-2f9d-d60&ascsubtag=%5b%5din%5bp%5dcj4u5jzvo0000osy64knayino%5bi%5dc50FCK%5bu%5d1%5bt%5dw%5bd%5dD%5bz%5dm), the
Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh wonders why global warming and natural
disaster haven't become major subjects of contemporary fiction --- why
we don't seem able to imagine climate catastrophe, and why we haven't
yet had a spate of novels in the genre he basically imagines into
half-existence and names "the environmental uncanny." "Consider, for
example, the stories that congeal around questions like, 'Where were you
when the Berlin Wall fell?' or 'Where were you on 9/11?' " he writes.
"Will it ever be possible to ask, in the same vein, 'Where were you at
400 ppm?' or 'Where were you when the Larsen B ice shelf broke up?' "
His answer: Probably not, because [the dilemmas and dramas of climate
change are simply incompatible with the kinds of stories we tell
ourselves about ourselves, especially in novels, which tend to emphasize
the journey of an individual conscience rather than the **poisonous
miasma of social fate**.]{.underline}

Surely this blindness will not last --- the world we are about to
inhabit will not permit it. [[In a six-degree-warmer world, the Earth's
ecosystem will boil with]{.mark} so many natural [disasters]{.mark} that
we will just start calling them "weather":]{.underline} a
[[constant]{.mark} swarm of out-of-control [typhoons]{.mark} and
[tornadoes]{.mark} and [floods and droughts,]{.mark} [the planet
assaulted regularly with]{.mark} climate [events]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
not so long ago [destroyed whole civilizations]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
strongest hurricanes will come more often, and we'll have to invent new
categories with which to describe them; tornadoes will grow longer and
wider and strike much more frequently, and hail rocks will quadruple in
size. Humans used to watch the weather to prophesy the future; going
forward, we will see in its wrath the vengeance of the past. Early
naturalists talked often about "deep time" --- the perception they had,
contemplating the grandeur of this valley or that rock basin, of the
profound slowness of nature. What lies in store for us is more like what
the Victorian anthropologists identified as "dreamtime," or "everywhen":
the semi-mythical experience, described by Aboriginal Australians, of
encountering, in the present moment, an out-of-time past, when
ancestors, heroes, and demigods crowded an epic stage. You can find it
already watching footage of an iceberg collapsing into the sea --- a
feeling of history happening all at once.

[A crucial]{.underline} additional [parameter]{.underline} of this
scenario [is **temporal**: How much time will be required to realize
these steps? **[Optimistic expansion]{.mark}**]{.underline} timetables
[[presuppose]{.underline}]{.mark} large and [**[sustained
investments]{.mark}** in space, which are **unlikely**]{.underline}. 5
But [[it seems **plausible**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [these [steps
might be accomplished over **several centuries**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
However, [this schedule assumes]{.underline} that [the Earth will be
**willing** and **able** to provide significant]{.underline} initial
[support for colonization. The question of how rapidly]{.underline}
self-sufficient [colonies could be established has **direct
implications** for their ability to serve as hedges to]{.underline}
terrestrial catastrophic and **[existential threats]{.underline}**.

[Based on the]{.underline} earlier [analysis of technological
feasibility]{.underline}, the [solar [expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}
success scenario [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} probably [**possible**, with
**critical uncertainties** about health and artificial
biospheres]{.underline}. But [this scenario is]{.underline} also
[**[very improbable]{.mark}** for many strong reasons. [Inaction,
failure, or]{.mark} **debilitating [conflict]{.mark}** [are more
likely]{.mark} than success. Colonization may]{.underline} [not be
attempted because [it]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} too
[[**difficult** and **expensive**]{.mark}, or]{.underline} because of
growing [Earth problems and troubles. [Off-Earth living could be **too
unhealthy**]{.mark}]{.underline} for humans, [and [**reproduction** and
**child growth**]{.mark} in low-gravity environments [may be
infeasible]{.mark}]{.underline}, confining viable habitat to spinable
artificial bodies. [**Potent [pathogens]{.mark}** [might evolve]{.mark}
in]{.underline} novel [space environments. [**Artificial ecosystems**
could be]{.mark} too [difficult]{.mark} to create]{.underline} and
sustain. [[People **may not want to**]{.mark} live on Mars or an
asteroid]{.underline}, for the same reasons they do not live in the
middle of the Sahara or Antarctica. Or [colonization might be attempted
and]{.underline} quickly [**fail**, like Norse Vineland in Newfoundland
or Scot Darien in Panama. Or a colony might be]{.underline} only
[minimally successful and linger as a **remote**]{.underline},
climate-stunted [**backwater**, like early]{.underline} modern [Iceland.
Space [colonies might be]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[like]{.underline}]{.mark} the many **[[failed
societies]{.underline}]{.mark}** analyzed by the geographer Jared
Diamond in Collapse. 6 [[The small population]{.underline}]{.mark} of a
space settlement [[might succumb to disease or]{.underline}]{.mark}
[debilitating]{.underline} internecine [conflict. [Conflicts
over]{.mark} the **[limited]{.mark} number of**]{.underline}
metal-bearing [**[asteroids]{.mark}** might start early]{.underline}. 7
[The sponsoring Earth agent might abandon its colony]{.underline} due to
shifting priorities, insufficient resources, or diverting conflicts. [If
interstate rivalry propels colonization it will happen]{.underline} more
[rapidly but]{.underline} will [also]{.underline} be more likely to
[involve violence sooner. If **rivalrous states** establish colonies,
**conflict**]{.underline} between them [might]{.underline} beggar and
hobble \[[hinder\] all. There may be a vast gap between a colony that
can be kept operational with]{.underline} continual [inputs from Earth
and one that is capable of persisting **without**]{.underline} any
**[Earth support]{.underline}**. If, as Sagan proposed, large-scale
settlement is delayed until after major terrestrial problems have been
solved, the prospects for success rise, while the rationales weaken and
the time frames lengthen. And [as colonization becomes imminent,
[doubts]{.mark}]{.underline} of the sort voiced here [[may lead to
**organized opposition**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[The success scenario]{.underline}, and much of space expansionist
thinking, [operates with [the]{.mark}]{.underline} implicit
[**[assumption]{.mark}** that space [settlement will be propelled
by]{.mark}]{.underline} numerous [**[capable agents]{.mark}** committed
to advancing the **long-term success** of humanity. This [is]{.mark} a
**[dubious]{.mark}** assumption, [given that]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[Earth's]{.underline}]{.mark} growing [[problems have **yet to
stimulate**]{.mark} the emergence of]{.underline} numerous [[powerful
agents]{.mark} committed to advancing **even**]{.underline} the species'
[**short-term success**.]{.underline} And [if powerful actors were
motivated by long-term species interest, colonization would be much less
necessary.]{.underline}

The success scenario also assumes that different space ventures build on
each other when they [The success scenario]{.underline} also [operates
with]{.underline} what can be called [the Benign Parent
Model]{.underline} of Terra-Colony Relations. In this approach, Earth
[**lavishes resources** on its space colonial offspring and **benignly
supervises** their development]{.underline} until they are able to
direct and support themselves. Constitutions for space polities
embodying the best of Terran political wisdom are established.
[This]{.underline} model, however, [is]{.underline} almost [**entirely
at variance** with the **historical experience** of]{.underline}
terrestrial [colonization]{.underline} and the incentives of relevant
self-interested actors. [To the extent [states]{.mark}]{.underline} or
corporations [invest in space colonies, they]{.underline} will [want to
**maintain control** and reap the benefits]{.underline} of their
investments. [To the extent they anticipate **colonial independence**,
they **will not invest**]{.underline}; if they do, [they [will try to
keep colonies **small** and **dependent**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The success scenario also assumes that different [space
ventures]{.underline} build on each other when they [might **subvert**
and **impede** one another]{.underline}. The two central projects, [Mars
colonization and asteroidal resource extraction, might be quite
antagonistic. [Wealth]{.mark}]{.underline} generated [[from space
resources will]{.underline}]{.mark} most probably [[be repatriated to
Earth]{.mark}, not plowed into]{.underline} space [habitat construction.
Asteroidal exploitation is likely to be]{.underline} capital- and
[robot-intensive, with a minimal human]{.underline} labor
[force]{.underline} rotating through small off-world bases, as on
off-shore oil rigs. If resources from asteroids are the bonanza some
anticipate, the [[beneficiaries]{.mark} of this wealth **[will not want
colonies]{.mark}** to **contest their access**]{.underline} and
possession [[and]{.mark} can be expected to [**actively oppose
colonization**. The more]{.mark} space [mining benefits terrestrial
actors, the greater]{.mark}]{.underline} their [[incentive to **impede
space settlements**]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [once the **bombardment
potential** of asteroidal]{.underline} orbital alteration [technology
becomes obvious, [the **dangers**]{.mark} **of**]{.underline}
independent [**space colonies** [might be]{.mark} sufficiently [obvious
to **thwart**]{.mark}]{.underline} their
**[[realization]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[A long list of]{.underline} powerful [barriers stand between
colonization]{.underline} visions [and accomplishment. [Given the **many
obstacles**]{.mark} that render successful]{.underline} space
[colonization]{.underline} at scale [very improbable, [it is]{.mark}
**extremely [imprudent]{.mark}** for humanity [to
view]{.mark}]{.underline} space [[colonization as a hedge
against]{.mark} catastrophe or [**extinction**. With **low probabilities
of success** and **significant**]{.mark}]{.underline} moral hazards and
**[[opportunity costs]{.underline}]{.mark}**, space [[colonization
should not be considered]{.mark} a [viable]{.mark} response
to]{.underline} severe [Earth problems]{.underline} and troubles.

**Space colonization causes [existential]{.underline}
wars\-\--**[secessionist movements]{.underline}, [reactionist
colonies]{.underline}, and [inter-colonial]{.underline} conflict
[outweigh]{.underline} every [terrestrial war in history]{.underline}.

**Kovic '21** \[Marko; February 2021; independent researcher and PhD at
Institute of Mass Communication and Media Research, University of
Zurich; Futures, "Risks of space colonization," vol. 126; kp\]

Imagine, [for example]{.underline}, the [large, **self-sustaining
habitat** on **Venus** that consists of 2 billion people]{.underline}
that I mentioned in a thought experiment before. [That hypothetical
habitat is truly **self-sustainable**, in the sense that survival on
Venus is not contingent in any way on resources or other kinds of
support from Earth. If **prior human history** is an
**indication**]{.underline}, it is conceivable that [the **Venusians**
could at some point seek to **change** their **political status**. They
might want to **no longer** be **governed by Earth** or Earth-based
governements and instead have sovereignty to **autonomously** and freely
shape Venus' future. They might]{.underline}, in other words, seek to
[**seceede** and become an independent political entity.]{.underline}

[[Given]{.mark} prior human [history of **secession**]{.mark} and
independence movements, such a claim to [**independence** in]{.mark} the
context of **[space col]{.mark}onization** could **easily
[result]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} **violent [conflict]{.mark}**, and given
the scale of the conflict parties in this scenario, the **bloodshed**
could be **much [greater]{.mark}** [than **all**]{.mark} **the
[wars]{.mark}** that happened [in]{.mark} **Earth's [history]{.mark}**
so far]{.underline}. Of course, we do not know what the dominant
political philosophy of the future will be. Perhaps popular sovereignty
and the wish for autonomy will be fully respected and met with
unconditional, enlightened understanding. But that prospect is, at best,
uncertain, and the prospect of catastrophic violent conflicts seems at
least possible.

5.2 **[Reactionary colonies]{.underline}**

[Let us assume for the sake of argument that]{.underline} the risks
surrounding secession- ist claims of extraterrestrial colonies will
eventually have been overcome and that [there are colonies which have
attained a **country-like** or world-like status. What should the
**political systems** in and the **moral foundations** of those
independent colonies look like? **Ideally**, they would be at least as
democratic, liberal, and generally morally progressive]{.underline} as
the most democratic, liberal, and morally progressive countries today.
[More specifically, independent fu- ture colonies should have
socio-political systems that do not **lower** average **wellbeing** or
**create**]{.underline} (disproportionately) **[more
suffering]{.underline}** compared to their pre-existing peers such as
Earth-based countries (Or whatever the dominant polity on Earth in that
future might be.). [**However**, [there is **no guarantee**]{.mark} that
independent [colonies will meet]{.mark} that **socio-political** and
**[moral bar]{.mark}**. It is possible that [there will be colonies
whose]{.mark} socio-political [systems are **regressive**]{.mark} in one
way or another, marked by a **relative moral decay** compared to the
baseline of political systems and moral frameworks. I call
such]{.underline} potential [undesirable entities **reactionary
colonies**.]{.underline}

The [emergence of reactionary colonies **might seem implausible** given
that humankind has, very roughly speaking, so far morally improved over
the course of its history]{.underline}8. [But reactionary colonies might
actually be a **fairly common** future development]{.underline}. If
humankind at some point achieves the tech- nological means for creating
colonies with relative ease, [creating new [colonies]{.mark} might be
[an **attractive**]{.mark} **option** [for **extremist**]{.mark}
**group[s]{.mark}** and **beliefs**. Imagine]{.underline}, for example,
[a **religious group** that believes in the fundamental **superiority**
of men over women. Such a religious group might find it difficult
adhering to their flawed moral principles in a pluralistic society.
Opting for **colonial exodus** might represent an attractive opportunity
for that religious group to build a society from scratch which is based
on their notions of female **inferiority** and
**subjugation**.]{.underline}

The specific risk posed by reactionary colonies ist twofold.
[Reactionary colonies would by definition **lower** the **average
happiness** and **wellbeing** of humankind and create unnecessary,
preventable **suffering**]{.underline}. Reactionary colonies would also
represent potential rogue actors that could greatly amplify the
aberration risks described in section 4. For example, [a **[dictatorial
regime]{.mark}** that causes great suffering to its population might be
tempted to expand its dictatorial **ideology** to other colonies. Or
that dictatorial colony could be [led by]{.mark} a [**psychopathic
elite** that enjoys]{.mark} letting **[sentient simulations
suffer]{.mark}** as much as possible]{.underline}. The [potential
catastrophic and even **[existential]{.mark}** **multiplicator
[effects]{.mark}** of reactionary colonies [are]{.mark}, unfortunately,
**[numerous]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

5.3 **[Inter-colonial conflict]{.underline}**

[Let us, again for the sake of the argument, assume that the previous
problem of reactionary colonies has somehow been solved or avoided.
Humankind has]{.underline} continued its path of technological
development, and it has [established several large clusters of colonies
beyond the Solar system]{.underline}. Assuming that the fundamental
problem of faster-than-light communication has not been solved yet,
[**communication** between the clusters **lags months** or even
**years**, and physical contact between the clusters is rare since
travel takes even longer than communication.]{.underline}

The [**inevitable [consequence]{.mark}** []{.mark}of such a
**splintering** of human civilization [is]{.mark} that the different
clusters of colonies would over time develop **[distinct
cultures]{.mark}**, and with only scarce and delayed contact with other
clusters, a form of **intergroup bias**]{.underline} \[40\], [the
**moral preference** of one's own **in-group** over the **out-group**,
would likely start to **manifest**]{.underline}. Over time, [that
**[us-versus- them]{.mark}** [heuristic]{.mark} could help create
**distinct** and **solidified** **social identities** within the colony
clusters]{.underline} \[41\], [and the beliefs and preferences about the
outgroup colonies could become more **overtly negative**]{.underline}.
Given enough time and great enough idiosyncratic development within each
colony cluster, [the cultural and moral connections between the colony
clusters could **further erode**]{.underline}, and in their place, [a
sense of **dread** and **looming danger** about the others' goals and
preferences could take hold]{.underline}. Over a long enough period of
time and great enough separation, [the perception that other colonies
are a threat could grow; so much so that taking **[preventative
action]{.mark}** and attacking and suppressing them [might seem]{.mark}
like the most **[rational]{.mark}** course of action]{.underline}
\[42\]. [[Given]{.mark} the **scale** and the likely **technological
sophistication** of **[future weapons]{.mark} systems**, a violent
[conflict]{.mark} between advanced colonies and colony clusters [would
create **suffering** on a]{.mark}n [**astronomical
scale**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Of course, the prospect of inter-colonial conflict is somewhat
speculative \[43\]. But [given humankind's **past experiences**, violent
conflict clearly seems within the realm of the possible]{.underline}.
That does not mean that such an almost immeasurably terrible conflict is
unavoidable. [Even the **slightest probability** of such conflict,
however, means **immense** potential expected **disvalue**.]{.underline}

**the [orbits]{.mark}** [of **all**]{.mark} the Near Earth

that timescale. That leaves [comets]{.mark}, and the chance of that
[is]{.mark} something like **[1 in 100 million]{.mark} per
century**]{.underline}, as a very rough guess (since 99% of the impacts
are thought to be from asteroids). [This risk has been pretty much
retired due to the automated asteroid searches by the likes of Pan

show that [the public is interested in human mission to Mars. The
most]{.underline} **[preferred]{.underline}** [space mission is
a]{.underline} **[crew in orbit]{.underline}** and a robot mission on

[[is]{.underline} **[low risk and low cost]{.underline}**]{.mark}. The
German space agency follows public opinion and social interest because
is focused on duty for society and oriented to social purposes as
"climate change, mobility, communication and security" (Zypries, 2017).
[[Politicians are prone to]{.mark} reduce space budgets or to **[not
invest in]{.mark} long-term human [settlement
missions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[due to]{.underline} **[public
opinion]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Consequently, progress in space
technology is still retarded. State of art in space transport means did
not change qualitatively since the Space Race between the US and the
Soviet Union. Impact of public opinion may differ in various countries.
Max Grimard (2012), p. 6) shows how important is space program for
public opinion in the US. Public sympathy for American presence in space
is counterbalanced by the unpredictability of politician authorities,
the tensions between presidents and the Congress (Grimard, 2012, p. 12),
and the important role played by competition with Russia and China
(Grimard, 2012, p. 6). Grimard adds that
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** is similar case but it
[is]{.underline} currently entire [[focused on]{.underline}]{.mark}
stability of space programs, including
**[[renovation]{.underline}]{.mark}** of old infrastructure than on new
space exploration programs. According to Grimard (2012), p. 13),
[this]{.underline} fact **[excludes]{.underline}** [Russia from being

Crawford, some space projects such as next generation of large
telescopes or crewed mission to Mars are non-profitable. While they are
a governmental duty, they could be funded partially by profits from
commercial exploration of space (for instance, space mining). [[Hope for
private exploration]{.mark} sounds reasonable but
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[counterbalanced]{.underline}**
[by]{.underline} **[commercial focus on profits]{.underline}**]{.mark}[.
Because mission to Mars has only scientific profits, **only public
sponsors** will be invested in this project]{.underline}. James S. J.
Schwartz (2014) adds that two of the possible reasons for human space
mission, such as improving human welfare and progress in scientific
exploration, are well beyond interests of private companies. Newman and
Williamson (2018) quite similarly expect that private space exploration
will be focused on financial profits more than on environmental
sustainability. [[Private investors are not obliged to act
altruistically]{.mark} and to sacrifice their business for uncertain
idea.]{.underline} W. Henry Lambright (2017) adds that [[private

**[[failures]{.underline}]{.mark}** even in relatively easy tasks as

**[receive profits]{.underline}**]{.mark}[. In scenario of commercial
exploration of space, we should wait for some point in the future when a
human space base appears as byproduct of **commercial
activity**]{.underline}. A human base on Mars might be a by-product of
hotels on LEO or space mining. Some investors who want to build space
hotels may try to settle space regions beyond LEO and build hotels on
the Moon and/or Mars. From touristic point of view, staying in the Moon
or Mars hotel may be more attractive than on LEO. Investors working in
asteroid mining may extend their business to the Moon and/or Mars. Both
enterprises even if focused on purely commercial purposes, will not be
easy (perhaps impossible) to achieve by private companies alone. Elvis
(2012), p. 549) argues that asteroid mining will be challenging due to,
among others, difficulties in detection of appropriate asteroids. He
shows that among about 1200 analyzed meteorites only 13 of them contain
high level of platinum profitable for their exploitation. Elvis suggests
that NASA should reorient its strategy from focus on exploration to
support for commercial utilization of space. Exploration will appear as
a consequence of commercial profitable activity (Elvis, 2012, p. 549).
Estimated profits of asteroid mining10 are counterbalanced by high costs
of exploitation and possible decreasing of price of currently rare
resources (Genta, 2014).11

Finally, we should note that the present paper compliments the
conclusions of several other scholars who have approached the topic from
different angles. Most notably, Brian Tomasik worries that
[[terraforming]{.mark} Earth-like [planets]{.mark} or [spread]{.mark}ing
[life via "directed panspermia"]{.mark}]{.underline} (as Claudius Gros,
who founded the Genesis Project, advocates) [[could]{.underline}
**[significantly increase]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**the [total]{.mark}
amount of [suffering]{.mark} in the universe**---an]{.underline}
**[especially bad outcome]{.underline}** [if one espouses a
"suffering-focused" ethics]{.underline} (Tomasik 2016, 2017a, 2017b).
[There could]{.underline} also [be]{.underline} **[massive simulations
running on exoplanets]{.underline}** that have been converted into
computronium [[in which]{.underline} **[billions]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[**of sentient simulants [suffer immense agony]{.mark}**[. Given]{.mark}
the **huge number of [future beings]{.mark}**]{.underline} [who could
exist if we do colonize space, [it stands to reason
that]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[someone]{.mark} somewhere]{.underline}**
[would run such simulations]{.underline} (perhaps from within a
simulation), [[create]{.underline} **[new
biospheres]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in which]{.underline} wild [**animals
are subject to Darwinian misery**, and so on.]{.underline} As Tomasik
(2017a) speculates, "if I had to make an estimate now, I would give
\~70% probability that [if humans choose to colonize space, [**this will
cause more suffering than it reduces on intrinsic grounds**." The result
could be]{.mark}]{.underline} [[an]{.underline}
**[s-risk]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Thus, the present paper offers a

4.3 **[Astronomical suffering]{.underline}**

[**[Space col]{.mark}onization** means]{.underline} that [humans and
human actions will spread beyond Earth and possibly cover, relatively
speaking, vast areas of the **reachable universe**. This]{.underline}
will potentially create immense positive value, but it also
[[makes]{.mark} possible a form of **[ex]{.mark}istential
[risks]{.mark}** [that are **astronomica**]{.mark}**l in scope** [and
**hellish**]{.mark} **in severity**]{.underline} --- [that are, in other
words, **orders of magnitude** **worse** than anything humankind has
caused or encountered so far. This subset of extreme existential risks
is referred to as **[s]{.mark}uffering [risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}
\[35\].

[**Suffering risks** are risks that [are **far worse** than]{.mark}
humankind **[going extinct]{.mark}** or entering permanent moral
stagnation because they mean that the [suffering]{.mark} that is created
through these risks [is **far greater** than **all suffering**
that]{.mark} has [existed]{.mark} on Earth [so far]{.mark}]{.underline}.
There are different vectors of potential astronomical suffering. For
example, it is conceivable that [[future human gen]{.mark}eration[s will
**spread wildlife** through]{.mark}out the colonized [space]{.mark},
either **inadvertently** or **actively**. **Wild [animals]{.mark}** [on
Earth]{.mark} generally [lead]{.mark} short, [miserable lives]{.mark}
full of sometimes the most brutal suffering]{.underline} \[36\]. In in
the history of Earth, [wildlife suffering has not really improved at
all, [so **astronomical wildlife suffering** would]{.mark} likely
[represent a **constant**]{.mark} **source** of
**[disvalue]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[Another vector]{.mark} for suffering risks [are **sentient
simulations**]{.mark}. Given growing computational power, it is
conceivable that [we will]{.mark} eventually be able to **[simulate
sentience]{.mark}**, and as soon as simulated sentience is
possible]{.underline}, simulated suffering will be as well. This
technological path is not necessarily depen- dent on space colonization,
but [a **[colonizing humankind]{.mark}** might have **greater
capabilities** for running such **simulations**, for example by
[tap]{.mark}ping [into]{.mark} the power of [stars]{.mark} in different
Solar systems. [Instances of]{.mark} simulated [suffering could **create
more suffering** than has ever occurred in]{.mark} the **biological
[universe]{.mark}**, with[in]{.mark} **fractions of a
[second]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The [risk of astronomical suffering]{.underline} is more uncertain than
other existential risks, but it [is at the same time **more severe**. At
stake is not just humankind's total potential positive future moral
value, but **[disvalue]{.mark}** that is **decoupled** from humankind
and [is]{.mark} potentially **many orders of magnitude
[greater]{.mark}** [than all]{.mark} the **[happiness]{.mark}** and
**wellbeing** that could be [created by]{.mark} human
**[colonization]{.mark} of space**.]{.underline}

Welfare biology Because at least some people choose a conditional
maximum as their reference preference, we have to give some weight to
the person affecting view in population ethics. In that case, we have a
priority to avoid the existence of individuals with lives not worth
living. Here we face the problem of wild animal suffering. It is
possible that some [animals in nature have [lives **not worth
living**]{.mark}, because their lives are **[full of negative
experiences]{.mark}** due to hunger, diseases, injuries, parasites and
predators. Especially the animals with an **r-selection** reproductive
strategy have a problem: these animals have a lot of
offspring]{.underline} (the population has a high rate of reproduction,
hence the name 'r-selection'), [and **only a few of them survive** long
enough to reproduce themselves. Most lives of those animals are **very
short** and probably **miserable**. We are not likely to see the
majority of those animals, because they will die and be eaten
quickly]{.underline}. A better reproductive strategy in terms of
well-being, is K-selection: having few offspring with long lives and
high survival rates. If a life is long, it is more likely to be positive
because it has proportionally fewer negative experiences of hunger or
deadly diseases. Only humans are very close to a perfect K-selection:
the average fertility rate of a woman is 2,5 children, and this rate is
decreasing and expected to reach 2 children in the second halve of this
century. When it reaches 2 children per woman, and when all children
survive till they reproduce, the human population becomes stable. Every
human can have a full live. (As lifespan increases, the fertility rate
can drop below 2 children per woman.) According to the person affecting
view, we have to give priority to avoiding r-selection and promoting
K-selection. Perhaps with genetic manipulation (e.g. gene drives), we
can turn every population into K-selection (where female animals have on
average two offspring) and make sure that all animals have long healthy
lives. But for the moment, only humans are about to reach the ideal
K-selection reproduction. Healthy humans have other advantages: they
have complex preferences and strong personal identities over time, which
means they can have potentially high levels of lifetime well-being when
their preferences are satisfied. So it is possible that humans can have
larger relative preferences than non-human animals. Most humans can also
clearly communicate their preferences: it is easier to determine the
levels of well-being of humans who can self-consciously think and speak
than the levels of well-being of non-human animals who can only
communicate their preferences in very indirect ways through behavior.
Estimating the well-being or relative preferences of wild animals is
very difficult and may require accurate brain scans. We can be very
confident that the lives of healthy humans are worth living, but not
confident at all that the life of an average wild animal is worth
living. The above implies that we can give a priority to saving and
helping humans. This preference for healthy humans (increasing the
relative number of healthy humans) is not speciesism, because the basic
criteria to derive this preference (e.g. the level of personal identity
over time, the level of communication and the level of K-selection) did
not refer to species membership. The above discussion did not use the
word 'species' at all. Given our current state of knowledge, a
preference for healthy humans is most likely to satisfy the maximum
relative preferences principle. Pros and cons of human population growth
As explained above, helping humans means increasing K-selection in the
world. The more individuals who belong to a K-selection population, the
better. However, there are also problems with human population growth.
More humans means more competition for scarce resources, more people who
can invent dangerous technologies, more greenhouse gas emissions, higher
likelihood of spreading of dangerous viruses. These things increase
existential risks. But it can also mean more mutually beneficial
situations through trade and cooperation, more inventions of good
technologies, higher likelihood of resistance against dangerous viruses.
However, there is one very big disadvantage of giving priority to
humans: most humans consume animal products. Buying animal products
gives an incentive to breed animals who have lives not worth living in
e.g. factory farms. Fighting poverty and promoting economic development
might increase animal suffering: a \$1,000 increase in per capita GDP in
the poorest countries implies an increased consumption of 1.7 kg of meat
per person per year. Saving the life of a human omnivore means a
consumption of about 30 kg of meat. It is difficult to estimate the
total costs and benefits of further human population growth. Give the
consumption of animal products, I tend towards the conclusion that
decreasing human population growth is valuable, but only if it is done
in a way that has other cobenefits. Avoiding unwanted pregnancies
through family planning is the only strategy that has a lot of
cobenefits in terms of women's rights, health of newborn children,
environmental impact reduction and poverty reduction. The benefit-cost
ratio of family planning is high. This means that family planning may
also be consistent with the total view in population ethics, even if
fewer happy people might come into existence. Finally by reducing the
fertility rate, family planning is a means to reach perfect K-selection.
Therefore, I give a low priority to family planning by supporting
organizations such as Marie Stopes International. Cause area: veganism
and antidiscrimination As helping humans involves a risk of increasing
animal suffering, I give a high priority to promoting veganism, animal
rights and antispeciesism. According to some thought experiments, we can
conclude that most animals in agriculture and aquaculture have lives not
worth living, so creating those lives violates both the person affecting
view and the total view in population ethics. Promoting veganism is a
more neglected area than improving human health and well-being.
Furthermore, veganism also has many cobenefits in terms of improved
human health: less chronic diseases due to healthier diets, less health
impact from climate change due to lower greenhouse gas emissions, less
malnutrition due to lower food prices for the poorest people, and less
health risks from pollution, zoonotic viruses and antibiotic resistant
bacteria. Veganism also facilitates spreading the value of
antidiscrimination. Speciesism is an example of discrimination. If
people consume animal products, a cognitive dissonance prevents them
from valuing animals as equal to humans. When they eat vegan, this
cognitive dissonance diminishes and they are more open to the value of
antispeciesism. The interspecies model of prejudice predicts that a
decrease in speciesism results in a decrease in racism, i.e. a decrease
of prejudice against other groups of people. Antispeciesism is also
necessary to start scientific research about wild animal suffering and
to find safe and effective means to intervene in nature to improve wild
animal well-being. And finally, antispeciesism becomes important when it
comes to the development of artificial general intelligence and
superintelligence. If we create superintelligent AI machines and
implement them with our own speciesist goals, even more animals can be
exploited by AI machines for many years in the future. The cause area of
veganism is also relatively neglected and tractable, which means
effective altruists have a lot of high impact opportunities in this
area. Effective vegan advocacy, perhaps with deep canvassing, is
promising. But clean meat, and more generally tissue engineering, appear
to be very promising as well. With these technologies, we can create
animal products without using animals. It might also be a crucial
technology for wild animal suffering reduction, as it can provide a food
alternative for predators. The tissue engineering technology can also be
used to extend life and replace a lot of animal experimentation.
Therefore, I support the Good Food Institute and to a lesser degree the
Methuselah Foundation. Catastrophic risks [There are]{.underline}
several [possible extinction risks (X-risks) where everyone
dies]{.underline}: asteroid impacts, supervolcano eruptions, pandemic
viruses, runaway global warming, global nuclear war, dangerous
nanotechnology. [According to the **total view** of population ethics,
extinction]{.underline} of sentient and intelligent life [is a tragedy,
because it means a lot of future preference satisfaction (well-being,
happiness) is lost. Hence, extinction prevention (X-risk reduction) gets
a top priority]{.underline}. [From a **person affecting** view,
extinction is **less bad**, because with extinction, non-existent future
beings cannot complain and wild animals with lives not worth living will
no longer be born, so future complaints will be avoided. Extinction is
**only bad** for those of the current generations who value a continued
existence in the far future, and especially for the last generation,
because most extinction scenarios involve suffering when everyone
dies]{.underline}. [But there is a **[class of catastrophic risks that
is even worse than X-risks: S-risks]{.mark} or suffering risks**, where
the [future contains]{.mark} huge [populations of sentient beings with
lives full of misery]{.mark}. **This is [worse than
extinction]{.mark}**, because an S-risk is **terrible** **both** from a
total view as well as from a person affecting view]{.underline}. [An
[example]{.mark} of an S-risk [is]{.mark} space [colonization where we
**export** wild animal suffering]{.mark} and livestock farming: the
[number of animals with lives not worth living will **multiply** when
other planets are colonized]{.mark}]{.underline}. Before we start with
space colonization, we should first adopt veganism and antispeciesist
values such that we will not export and multiply animal suffering.

Abstract: This article argues that, [contra **Bostrom**]{.underline}
(2003), [[**every second** of **delayed space col**]{.mark}**onization**
could be **immensely [desirable]{.mark}**]{.underline}; indeed, [the
longer the delay, the better, with the **[best outcome being no
colonization]{.mark} at all**]{.underline}. The argument begins by
hypothesizing that expansion into space will generate a wide variety of
distinct species, many having their own cultural, political, religious,
etc. traditions. Next, [the paper offers reasons [for expecting]{.mark}
**catastrophic [conflicts]{.mark}** between different civilizations,
both near and far, to be the **default outcome**]{.underline}. Third, it
examines some strategies for mitigating conflict, including (i) the
establishment of a "cosmic Leviathan" that is capable of imposing law
and order within the cosmopolitical arena, and (ii) the implemen- tation
of policies of deterrence to prevent one civilization from attacking
another. Both of these strategies appear problematic, though, due to (a)
fundamental physical limitations on the speed of space travel and the
transfer of information, and (b) the advanced weaponry that future
civili- zations will almost certainly have at their disposal. [The
conclusion is that colonizing our solar system, galaxy, and beyond will
engender a **Hobbesian predicament** in which all actors are perpetually
in **fear** of **being destroyed**]{.underline}---that is, when they
aren't engaged in devastating wars with their neighbors.

Here [we should also not overlook the potential for
**[accidents]{.mark}** to [cause **conflicts**]{.mark}]{.underline} when
inter-civilizational tensions are sufficiently high. The disturbing
historical fact is that [**["pure dumb luck"]{.mark}** played a critical
role in [prevent]{.mark}ing [nuclear war from]{.mark} occurring during
the **[Cold War]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indi- viduals like Vasili
Arkhipov and Stanislav Petrov more or less single-handedly averted
nuclear holocausts, and an interpretation error in 1995 led Boris
Yeltsin to become "the first Russian president to ever have the 'nuclear
suitcase' open in front of him" (Cirincione 2013). Although intelligence
is negatively correlated with accident proneness, and presumably our
(post)human descendants will be cognitively enhanced to some extent,
[[even]{.mark} a **[small probability of error]{.mark}** could [make
**disaster**]{.mark} almost **[certain]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see
Author). For example, [[imagine]{.mark} that a mere [500 people have
access]{.mark} to a "**button**"]{.underline} [that, if pushed, would
initiate a catastrophic first strike against the other civilization. [If
each]{.mark} of these individuals [has]{.mark} a mere **[0.01
chance]{.mark} per decade** of accidentally pushing this button, the
[result is]{.mark} a staggering **[99.3 percent]{.mark} probability**
[that]{.mark}, within **10 years**, the **[strike will
occur]{.mark}**]{.underline}. So, perhaps [[Earth and
Mars]{.underline}]{.mark}---whose civilizations could potentially
coexist for another 10 million centuries, until the sun burns
out---[**[won't be]{.mark} quite as [lucky]{.mark}** as the US and
Soviet Union were for the slightly more than four decades between 1947
and 1991.]{.underline}

On the other end of the spectrum, the norm could be weaker. The
[Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings provided a vivid and enduring image of
the horrors of nuclear war]{.underline}---hence the norm can reasonably
be described as a legacy of the bombings. Without this image, there
would be less to motivate the norm. A weaker norm could in turn have led
to a nuclear war occurring later, especially during a near-miss event
like the Cuban missile crisis. **[[A later nuclear war would likely be
much more severe]{.mark}, [assuming]{.mark} some [significant buildup of
nuclear arsenals]{.mark} and especially if "overkill" targeting was
used]{.underline}**. A [[new]{.mark} [nuclear]{.mark} [war]{.mark} could
bring a similarly wide range of shifts in nuclear weapons
norms.]{.underline} It [**[could strengthen the norm]{.underline}**,
**[hastening nuclear
disarmament]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** Already, [there is
a political initiative drawing attention to the humanitarian
consequences of nuclear weapons]{.underline} use in order to promote a
new treaty to ban nuclear weapons as a step towards complete nuclear
disarmament (Borrie 2014). It is easy to imagine this initiative using
any new nuclear attacks to advance their goals. Alternatively, it could
weaken the norm, potentially leading to more and/or larger nuclear wars.
This is a common concern, as seen for example in debates over low-yield
bunker buster nuclear weapons (Nelson 2003). [Given that the impacts of
a large nuclear war could be extremely severe, [a shift in nuclear
weapons norms could easily be the single most consequential effect of a
smaller nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Norms about nuclear
power can also be highly consequential[. Fear of ionizing radiation from
nuclear power inflates public concern about nuclear power]{.underline}
relative to the actual medical risk (e.g., Slovic 2012). Some of this
fear appears to derive from perceptions of nuclear weapons, especially
Hiroshima and Nagasaki (e.g., Cwikel 1997). A new nuclear attack could
strengthen general fears of nuclear radiation, further reducing support
for nuclear power. Reduced support for nuclear power can in turn have
major consequences to energy systems and the environment. Energy
analysts are divided on the details, with some warning that increased
use of fossil fuels.

AI arms races [**[Government AI development could go wrong in several
ways]{.mark}**. Plausibly [governments would botch the process]{.mark}
by not realizing the risks at hand]{.underline}. It\'s also possible
that governments would use the AI and robots for totalitarian purposes.
It seems that [both of [these bad scenarios would be **exacerbated by
international conflict**]{.mark}**.** Greater [hostility means countries
are more inclined to]{.mark} [use AI as a weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Indeed, [[whoever builds the first AI can take over the world]{.mark},
which makes building AI the ultimate arms race. **[A USA-China
race]{.mark}**]{.underline} is one reasonable possibility. [**Arms races
[encourage risk-taking]{.mark} \--** being willing to [skimp on safety

worse expected outcomes in general]{.underline}. CEV seems to have less
hope of success in a Cold War scenario. (\"What? You want to include the
evil Chinese in your CEV??\") With a pure CEV, presumably it would
eventually count Chinese values even if it started with just Americans,
because people would become more enlightened during the process.
However, when we imagine more crude democratic decision outcomes, this
becomes less likely. In [Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers,
Strategies]{.underline} (Ch. 14), [Nick Bostrom proposes that another
reason AI arms races would crimp AI safety is that **[competing teams
wouldn\'t be able to share insights about AI
control]{.mark}**]{.underline}. What Bostrom doesn\'t mention is that
competing teams also wouldn\'t share insights about AI capability. So
even if less inter-team information sharing reduces safety, it also
reduces speed, and the net effect isn\'t clear to me. Of course, there
are situations where arms-race dynamics can be desirable. In the
original prisoner\'s dilemma, the police benefit if the prisoners
defect. Defection on a tragedy of the commons by companies is the heart
of perfect competition\'s efficiency. It also underlies competition
among countries to improve quality of life for citizens[. [Arms races
generally speed up innovation]{.mark}, which can be good if the
innovation being produced is both salutary and not risky. This is not
the case for general AI. Nor is it the case for other \"[races to the

role in the epistemic processes of *some* future "optimists."
**[[One]{.underline}]{.mark}** contributing **[[factor is optimism
bias]{.underline}]{.mark}** (e.g. Sharot, Riccardi, Raio, & Phelps,
2007), which refers to the tendency to overestimate the likelihood of
positive future events while underestimating the probability and
severity of negative events -- even in the absence of evidence to
support such expectations. Another, related factor is [*wishful
thinking*](https://foundational-research.org/against-wishful-thinking/),
where people are prone to judging scenarios which are in line with their
desires as being more probable than what is epistemically justified,
while assigning lower credence to scenarios they dislike. Striving to
avert future dystopias inevitably requires one to contemplate vast
amounts of suffering on a regular basis, which is often demotivating and
may result in
[depression](https://www.facebook.com/Xuenay/posts/10155487265968662?comment_id=10155487433518662&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R1%22%7D).
By contrast, while the prospect of an apocalypse may also be depressing,
working towards a utopian future is more inspiring, and could therefore
(subconsciously) bias people towards paying less attention to s-risks.
Similarly, working towards the reduction of extinction risks or the
creation of a posthuman utopia is also favored by many people's
instinctual, self-oriented desires, notably one's own survival and that
of family members or other loved ones. As it is easier to motivate
oneself (and others) towards a project that appeals to altruistic as
well as more self-oriented desires, efforts to reduce risks of
astronomical suffering -- risks that lie in the distant future and often
involve the suffering of unusual or small minds less likely to evoke
empathy -- will be comparatively neglected. This does not mean that the
above motivations are misguided or unimportant; rather, it means that if
one also, upon reflection, cares a great deal about reducing suffering,
then it might take deliberate effort to give this concern due justice.
Lastly, psychological inhibitions against contemplating s-risks and
unawareness of such considerations are interrelated and tend to
reinforce each other. II.II Unawareness of possible sources of
astronomical suffering In discussions about the risks from
smarter-than-human artificial intelligence, it is often assumed that the
sole reason to consider AI safety an important focus area is because it
decides between utopia or human extinction. The possibility that
misaligned or suboptimally aligned AI might instantiate suffering in
astronomical quantities is, however, rarely brought up. Misaligned AI as
a powerful but morally indifferent optimization process might transform
galactic resources into highly optimized structures, some of which might
very well include suffering. The structures **[[a superintelligent
AI]{.underline}]{.mark}** or an AI-based economy decoupled from human
interests **[[would build]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the pursuit of its
goals may for instance include **[[a fleet of "worker
bots,"]{.underline}]{.mark}** factories, supercomputers to [simulate
ancestral Earths for scientific
purposes](https://foundational-research.org/risks-of-astronomical-future-suffering/#Sentient_simulations),
and space colonization machinery, to name a few. In the absence of
explicit concern for suffering reflected in the goals of such an
optimization process, **[[AI systems would be willing to instantiate
suffering minds]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or
"[subroutines](https://foundational-research.org/risks-of-astronomical-future-suffering/#Suffering_subroutines)")
**[[for even the slightest benefit to their
objectives.]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Note that, as was the case with
natural selection's use of wild animals, some of these optimization
processes might also lead to the instantiation of happy minds.) This is
especially worrying because the stakes involved could literally turn out
to be astronomical: Space colonization is an attractive subgoal for
almost any powerful optimization process, as it leads to control over
the largest amount of resources. Even if only a small portion of these
resources are used for purposes that involve suffering, **[[the
resulting disvalue would tragically be
enormous.]{.underline}]{.mark}**[^8^](https://foundational-research.org/reducing-risks-of-astronomical-suffering-a-neglected-priority/#link_ajs-fn-id_8-3131)
Finally, next to bad states of affairs being brought about for
instrumental reasons, because of indifference to suffering, there is
also the risk that bad states of affairs could be brought about for
strategic reasons: In competition or conflict between different
factions, if one side is compassionate and the other not[,
**[threatening to bring about bad states of affairs could be used as an
extortion tactic.]{.underline}**]{.mark} For an overview on ways the
future could contain vast amounts of suffering -- including as a result
of suboptimally aligned AI or human-controlled futures where dangerous
ideologies win -- see [Superintelligence as a Cause or Cure for Risks of
Astronomical
Suffering](https://foundational-research.org/superintelligence-cause-cure-risks-astronomical-suffering/)
and [Risks of Astronomical Future
Suffering](https://foundational-research.org/risks-of-astronomical-future-suffering/).
**II.III [[Astronomical suffering as a likely
outcome]{.mark}]{.underline}** One might argue that the scenarios just
mentioned tend to be speculative, maybe extremely speculative, and
should thus be discounted or even ignored altogether. However, the claim
that creating extremely powerful agents with alien values and no
compassion might lead to vast amounts of suffering -- through some way
or another -- is a *disjunctive* prediction. Only *one* possible action
by which the AI could increase its total utility, yet involving vast
quantities of suffering, would be required for the AI to pursue this
path *without reservation.* Worries of this sort are weakly supported by
the universe's historical track record, where the "morally indifferent
optimization process" of Darwinian evolution instantiated vast amounts
of misery in the form of [wild-animal
suffering](https://foundational-research.org/the-importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/).
Even if the probability of any one specific scenario involving
astronomical amounts of suffering (like the ones above, or other
scenarios not yet mentioned or thought of) is small, the probability
that at least one scenario will occur may be fairly high. In this
context, **[[we should beware the disjunction
fallacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Bar-Hillel & Neter, 1993), according to
which most people not only underestimate the probability of disjunctions
of events, but they actually judge the disjunction as *less* likely than
a single event comprising
it.[^9^](https://foundational-research.org/reducing-risks-of-astronomical-suffering-a-neglected-priority/#link_ajs-fn-id_9-3131)

You've probably been told that the singularity is coming. It is that
long-awaited point in time --- likely, a point in our very near future
--- when advances in artificial intelligence lead to the creation of a
machine (a technological form of life?) smarter than humans. If Ray
Kurzweil is to be believed, [[the [singularity will happen]{.mark} in
2045](https://futurism.com/kurzweil-claims-that-the-singularity-will-happen-by-2045/).]{.underline}
If we throw our hats in with Louis Rosenberg, then [the day will be
arriving a little sooner, [likely]{.mark} sometime [in
2030]{.mark}]{.underline}. MIT's Patrick Winston would have you believe
that it will likely be a little closer to Kurzweil's prediction, [though
he puts the date at 2040,
specifically](https://futurism.com/separating-science-fact-science-hype-how-far-off-singularity/).
But [what difference does it make]{.underline}? [We are talking about a
difference of [just 15 years.]{.mark}]{.underline} The real question is,
is the singularity *actually* on its way? At the [World Government
Summit in Dubai](https://www.worldgovernmentsummit.org/), I spoke with
Jürgen Schmidhuber, who is the Co-Founder and Chief Scientist at [AI
company NNAISENSE](https://nnaisense.com/), Director of the Swiss AI lab
IDSIA, and heralded by some as the "father of artificial intelligence"
to find out. He is confident that [[the singularity will happen, and
rather soon]{.underline}]{.mark}. Schmidhuber says it "[is just 30 years
away, if the trend doesn't break, and [there will be]{.mark} rather
[cheap computational devices]{.mark} that have as many connections as
[your brain but]{.mark} are [much faster]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said.
And that's just the beginning. [Imagine a cheap little device that isn't
just smarter than humans --- [it can compute as much data as all human
brains]{.mark} taken together.]{.underline} [Well, this may become a
reality just 50 years from now. "And there will be many, many of those.
There is no doubt in my mind that [AIs are going to become super
smart]{.mark}," Schmidhuber says.]{.underline} Today, the world faces a
number of hugely complex challenges, from global warming to the refugee
crisis. These are all problems that, over time, will affect everyone on
the planet, deeply and irreversibly. But the real seismic change, one
that will influence the way we respond to each one of those crises, will
happen elsewhere. "[It is much more than just another industrial
revolution. It is something that transcends humankind and life
itself]{.underline}." "All of this complexity pales against this truly
important development of our century, which is much more than just
another industrial revolution," Schmidhuber says. Of course, the
development that he is referring to is [the [development of]{.mark}
these artificial [superintelligences]{.mark}]{.underline}, a thing
that Schmidhuber says "[is something that [transcends]{.mark} humankind
and [life itself]{.mark}]{.underline}." [When biological life emerged
from chemical evolution]{.underline}, 3.5 billion years ago[, a random
combination of simple, lifeless elements kickstarted the explosion of
species populating the planet today. Something of comparable magnitude
may be about to happen]{.underline}. "Now [the universe is making a
similar step forward from lower complexity to higher
complexity]{.underline}," Schmidhuber beams. "And it's going to be
awesome." Like with biological life, there will be an element of
randomness to that crucial leap between a powerful machine and
artificial life. [And while we may not be able to predict exactly
when,]{.underline} **[[all evidence points to]{.mark} the fact [that the
singularity will happen]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**AI engineers a dystopia [worse]{.underline} than extinction.**

pp. 194-196, cc

[**[Losing]{.mark} our [potential]{.mark}** means getting
**[lock]{.mark}ed [in]{.mark}to** a **bad set of futures**]{.underline}.
We can categorize existential catastrophes by looking at which aspects
of our future get locked in. [This could be]{.underline} a world without
humans (**[extinction]{.underline}**) or a world without civilization
(unrecoverable collapse). [But it could also take the form of [an
**unrecoverable dystopia**]{.mark}]{.underline}---a world with
civilization intact, but locked into a terrible form,
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} little or no value.116

\[Footnote 116\]

In the worst cases, [perhaps even **[negative value]{.mark}**---an
outcome **[worse than extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

\[Footnote 116 ends\]

This has not happened yet, but the past provides little comfort. For
these kinds of catastrophes only became possible with the advent of
civilization, so our track record is much shorter. And there is reason
to think that the risks may increase over time as the world becomes more
interconnected and experiments with new technologies and ideologies.

I won't attempt to address these dystopian scenarios with the same level
of scientific detail as the risks we've explored so far, for the
scenarios are diverse and our present understanding of them very
limited. Instead, my aim is just to take some early steps toward
noticing and understanding these very different kinds of failure.

We can divide the unrecoverable dystopias we might face into three
types, on the basis of whether they are desired by the people who live
in them. There are possibilities where the people don't want that world,
yet the structure of society makes it almost impossible for them to
coordinate to change it. There are possibilities where the people do
want that world, yet they are misguided and the world falls far short of
what they could have achieved. And in between there are possibilities
where only a small group wants that world but enforces it against the
wishes of the rest. Each of these types has different hurdles it would
need to overcome in order to become truly locked in.

Note that to count as existential catastrophes, these outcomes don't
need to be impossible to break out of, nor to last millions of years.
Instead, the defining feature is that entering that regime was a crucial
negative turning point in the history of human potential, locking off
almost all our potential for a worthy future. One way to look at this is
that when they end (as they eventually must), we are much more likely
than we were before to fall down to extinction or collapse than to rise
up to fulfill our potential. For example, a dystopian society that
lasted all the way until humanity was destroyed by external forces would
be an existential catastrophe. However, if a dystopian outcome does not
have this property, if it leaves open all our chances for success once
it ends---it is a dark age in our story, but not a true existential
catastrophe.

[The most familiar type is [the **enforced**]{.mark} **dystopia**.
The]{.underline} rise of **[expansionist
[totalitarianism]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the mid-twentieth century
caused intellectuals such as George Orwell to raise the possibility of a
totalitarian state achieving global dominance and absolute control,
locking the world into a miserable condition.117 The regimes [of
**Hitler** and **Stalin** serve as a **proof of
principle**]{.underline}, each [[scal]{.mark}ing up to [become]{.mark}
**imperial [superpowers]{.mark}** [while maintaining]{.mark} **extreme
[control]{.mark}**]{.underline} over their citizens.118 However, it is
unclear whether Hitler or Stalin had the expansionist aims to control
the entire world, or the technical and social means to create truly
lasting regimes.119

This may change. **[[Tech]{.mark}nological progress]{.underline}** has
[offered **many new [tools]{.mark}** that]{.underline} could be used to
[detect and [undermine dissent]{.mark}]{.underline}, and there is every
reason to believe that this will continue over the next century.
[**Advances in [AI]{.mark}** seem **especially relevant**, allowing
automated]{.underline}, detailed **[[monitor]{.mark}ing of
[everything]{.mark}]{.underline}** that happens in public places--- both
physical and online. [Such]{.underline} advances may [make it possible
[to have **regimes**]{.mark} that are **far more stable** than those of
old.]{.underline}

That said, technology is also providing new tools for rebellion against
authority, such as the internet and encrypted messages. Perhaps the
forces will remain in balance, or shift in favor of freedom, but there
is a credible chance that they will shift toward greater control over
the populace, making enforced dystopias a realistic possibility.

A second kind of unrecoverable dystopia is a stable civilization that is
desired by few (if any) people. It is easy to see how such an outcome
could be dystopian, but not immediately obvious how we could arrive at
it, or lock it in, if most (or all) people do not want it.120

The answer lies in the various population-level forces that can shape
global outcomes. Well-known examples include market forces creating a
race to the bottom, Malthusian population dynamics pushing down the
average quality of life, or evolution optimizing us toward the spreading
of our genes, regardless of the effects on what we value. These are all
dynamics that push humanity toward a new equilibrium, where these forces
are finally in balance. But there is no guarantee this equilibrium will
be good.

For example, consider the tension between what is best for each and what
is best for all. This is studied in the field of game theory through
"games" like the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons,
where each individual's incentives push them toward producing a
collectively terrible outcome. The Nash equilibrium (the outcome we
reach if we follow individual incentives) may be much worse for everyone
than some other outcome we could have achieved if we had overcome these
local incentives.

The most famous example is environmental degradation, such as pollution.
Because most of the costs of pollution aren't borne by the person who
causes it, we can end up in a situation where it is in the self-interest
of each person to keep engaging in such activities, despite this making
us all worse off. It took significant moral progress and significant
political action to help us break out of this. We may end up in new
traps that are even harder to coordinate our way out of. This could be
at the level of individuals, or at the level of groups. We could have
nations, ideological blocs, or even planets or descendent species of
Homo sapiens locked in harmful competition---doing what is best for
their group, but bad for groups on the whole.

I don't know how likely it is that we suffer a sufficiently bad (and
sufficiently intractable) tragedy of the commons like this. Or that we
are degraded by evolutionary pressures, or driven to lives of very low
quality by Malthusian population dynamics, or any other such situation.
I'd like to hope that we could always see such things coming and
coordinate to a solution. But it's hard to be sure that we could.

[[The]{.mark} third possibility is the "**[desired
dystopia]{.mark}**."]{.underline}121 Here it is easier to see how
universal desire for an outcome might cause us to lock it in, though
less clear how such an outcome could be dystopian. The problem is that
there are many compelling ideas that can radically shape our future
---especially ideologies and moral theories, as these make direct
normative claims about the world we should strive to create. [If
[combined with]{.mark} the **[tech]{.mark}nological or social
means**]{.underline} for instilling the same views in the next
generation (indoctrination, surveillance), [this has the potential [to
be **disastrous**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The historical record is rife with examples of seriously defective
ideologies and moral views that gripped large parts of the world.
Moreover, even reasonable normative views often recommend that they be
locked in---for otherwise a tempting rival view may take over, with
(allegedly) disastrous results.122 Even though the most plausible moral
views have a lot of agreement about which small changes to the world are
good and which are bad, they tend to come strongly apart in their
recommendations about what an optimal world would look like. [This
problem]{.underline} thus [echoes]{.underline} that of [[**AI
alignment**, where a]{.mark} **strong push** toward [a **mostly correct
ideal**]{.mark} could instead **[spell disaster]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Some plausible examples include: worlds that completely renounce further
technological progress (which ensures our destruction at the hands of
natural risks),123 worlds that forever fail to recognize some key form
of harm or injustice (and thus perpetuate it blindly), worlds that lock
in a single fundamentalist religion, and worlds where we deliberately
replace ourselves with something that we didn't realize was much less
valuable (such as machines incapable of feeling).124

All of these unrecoverable dystopias can be understood in terms of
lock-in. [**Key aspects** of]{.underline} the future of the
[civilization are]{.underline} being [**locked in** such that they are
almost **impossible to change**]{.underline}. If we are locked into a
sufficiently bad set of futures, [[we have]{.mark} an **unrecoverable
dystopia**; [an **existential catastrophe**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
