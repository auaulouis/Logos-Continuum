The Perils of [Democracy Promotion]{.underline}

The most important [requirement for building a liberal international
order]{.underline} is to **[spread liberal democracy]{.underline}** far
and wide, which was initially seen to be an eminently feasible task. It
was widely believed in the West that politics had evolved to the point
where there was no sensible alternative to liberal democracy. If so,
then it would be relatively easy to create a liberal international
order, because spreading liberal democracy around the world would meet
little resistance. Indeed, most people would welcome the idea of living
in a Western-style democracy, as appeared to be the case in Eastern
Europe after the collapse of communism.

[This endeavor]{.underline}, however, **[was doomed from the
start]{.underline}**. To begin, there never has been and never will be
universal agreement on what constitutes the ideal political system. One
can argue that liberal democracy is the best form of government (I
would), but others will invariably favor a different governing system.
It is worth remembering that during the 1930s, many people in Europe
preferred communism or fascism to liberal democracy. One might then
point out that liberal democracy ultimately triumphed over those two
"isms." Although that is true, the history of the 1930s is a reminder
that liberal democracy is not the preordained order of things, and it is
not unusual for elites and their publics to opt for alternative
political systems. Thus, it should not be surprising that illiberal
democracies are appearing in Eastern Europe, while China and Russia have
embraced authoritarian rule, North Korea is a dictatorship, Iran is an
Islamic republic, and Israel increasingly privileges its Jewish identity
over its democratic character.51 Nor should it be surprising that there
has never been a time when more than 50 percent of the countries in the
world were liberal democracies.52

This diversity of opinion about what constitutes the best governing
system combines with nationalism to make the process of spreading
liberal democracy around the world extremely difficult. Nationalism,
after all, is a remarkably powerful political force that places great
emphasis on self-determination and sovereignty. [Nation-states,
in]{.underline} other words, d**[o not want other nation-states telling
them how they should order their political system]{.underline}**. Thus,
trying to impose liberal democracy on a state that prefers an
alternative form of government is [almost]{.underline} **[certain to
provoke fierce resistance.]{.underline}**

FIGHTING LOSING WARS

[Trying to build]{.underline} **[a liberal international
order]{.underline}** [invariably leads to **wars**]{.underline}
[against]{.underline} minor **[powers that aim to turn those targets
into liberal democracies]{.underline}**. There are significant limits on
how much social engineering of this sort great powers can attempt in a
bipolar or multipolar system, mainly because they must focus on
competing with each other for power and influence. Spreading liberal
democracy is of secondary, if not tertiary, importance; indeed, at times
liberal states will seek to prop up authoritarian governments if they
are aligned against rival great powers, as the United States did
repeatedly during the Cold War.

In unipolarity, however, the sole pole is free to go on crusades to make
the world more democratic, simply because there are no rival great
powers to worry about. Thus, i[t is unsurprising that the United
States]{.underline} has **[fought seven wars in the years since the Cold
War]{.underline}** ended [and has been at war for two out of every three
years]{.underline} over that period.53 Such [wars]{.underline}, however,
[regularly fail to achieve their objective.]{.underline}

The U.S. effort to use military force to bring about democracy has been
focused primarily on the Greater [Middle East,]{.underline} where it has
[led to]{.underline} **[one failure after another]{.underline}**.54 U.S.
military forces invaded Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003) with the
intention of turning them into liberal democracies. The [occupying
forces]{.underline} not [only failed to achieve that goa]{.underline}l,
but they also [ended up precipitating]{.underline} **[bloody
wars]{.underline}** [that did enormous damage to political and social
life]{.underline} in those two countries. The main reason for this
dismal record is [that large-scale social engineering in any society is
difficult]{.underline}, but it is [especially daunting in a foreign
country whose political leadership has just been toppled from
power]{.underline}. The target state will be in turmoil; the invading
forces will be dealing with an alien culture that might even be hostile
to liberal democracy; and most importantly, nationalist sentiment is
sure to increase sharply and generate an insurgency against the
occupier, as the United States discovered in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Although these [failures]{.underline} **[eroded public support for the
liberal international order]{.underline}** and [cast doubts on the
competence of its leaders]{.underline}, they did not stop the sole pole
from trying to spread liberal democracy by military means,
over-extending itself even further.55 Instead, it looked for less costly
ways to accomplish that task, which effectively meant giving up on
conquering and occupying non-democracies and employing different
strategies to bring down authoritarian leaders. Thus, when fighting
broke out among rival factions in Libya in 2011, the United States and
its European allies employed airpower to help remove Col. Muammar
al-Gaddafi from power. But the Western powers had no way of turning
Libya into a functioning state, much less a liberal democracy, with or
without troops on the ground.

Also in 2011, the United States and its [allies]{.underline} in the
Middle East [sought to topple]{.underline} President Bashar al-Assad
from power in [Syria]{.underline} by [arming and training rebel
groups]{.underline} that opposed him. That [effort failed,]{.underline}
however, largely **[because Russia]{.underline}**, which has had
long-standing strategic ties with Syria, **[intervened]{.underline}** in
2015 to keep Assad in power. Realpolitik thwarted U.S. efforts in Syria.
But [even if Assad had been deposed, the end result would have been
either a continuation of the conflic]{.underline}t, as in Libya, or the
installation of another ruthless autocrat, as eventually happened in
Egypt after President Hosni Mubarak was deposed in early 2011. Liberal
democracy in Syria was not a serious possibility, but an abundance of
murder and mayhem was.

TURNING THE MAJOR POWERS INTO ENEMIES

Finally, [the]{.underline} **[crusader mentality]{.underline}** [that
underpins the]{.underline} **[attempts to build a liberal international
order]{.underline}** [leads to the]{.underline} **[poisoning of
relations between the unipole and any major power in the
system]{.underline}** [that is not a liberal democracy.]{.underline}
Although the dominant state will be strongly inclined to make war on
minor powers to promote liberal democracy, it will rarely ever attack
major powers for that purpose, especially if they possess nuclear
weapons.56 The costs would be too great, and the likelihood of success
would be especially low. Hence, U.S. policymakers in the post--Cold War
period have never seriously considered invading China or Russia, even
though the United States is far more powerful than either of those
countries.

Nevertheless, the [United States has been co**mmitted to turning China
and Russia into liberal democracies**]{.underline} [and absorbing them
into the U.S.-dominated **liberal world order.**]{.underline} U.S.
leaders have not only made their intentions clear, but they have also
relied on nongovernmental organizations and various subtle strategies to
push Beijing and Moscow toward embracing liberal democracy. In effect,
the aim is peaceful regime change. Predictably, [China and
Russia]{.underline} **[have resisted the]{.underline}** unipole's
**[efforts]{.underline}** for [the same reason that minor powers have
contested U.S. efforts to shape their domestic politics]{.underline},
and indeed for the same reason that Americans now recoil at the idea of
Russia interfering in their country's politics. In a world in which
nationalism is the most powerful political ideology, self-determination
and **[sovereignty matter hugely for all countries.]{.underline}**

[China and Russia have also resisted]{.underline} **[the spread of the
liberal order]{.underline}** for realist reasons, [because it would
allow the United States to]{.underline} **[dominate the international
system]{.underline}** economically, militarily, and politically.
[Neither Beijing nor Moscow, for example, wants U.S. military forces in
its neighborhood, much less on its borders]{.underline}. Thus, it is
hardly surprising that [China talks about pushing **the U.S. military
out of the Western Pacific**]{.underline} and that [Russia has long been
**deeply opposed to EU and NATO expansion**]{.underline} into Eastern
Europe. Indeed, moving those institutions toward Russia eventually led
to the Ukraine crisis in 2014. That ongoing conflict has not only
poisoned relations between Russia and the West, but it has incentivized
Moscow to find ways to weaken both the EU and NATO. In short, both
nationalist and realist calculations caused the two major powers in
unipolarity to contest the unipole's efforts to build a robust liberal
international order.

#### b. Median voter theory -- democracies fight capital intensive wars more frequently. 

**Caverley 10** -- Jonathan, Poli Sci Prof @ NU, The Myth of Military
Myopia: Democracy, Small Wars, and Vietnam, International Security 34.3.

This section offers a theory of how a rational actor, [[the average
voter]{.mark} in a democracy, can [favor]{.mark}]{.underline} what
appears to be a **[[nonstrategic policy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To do
so, it uses the core logic of a research program claiming that this sort
of behavior should rarely happen in democracies. The theory presented
here shares three impor- tant assumptions with the cost-internalization
logic of democratic exception- alism: the distribution of costs within
the state affects its pursuit of security; a democratic government\'s
provision of security is a public good; and voters \"take a reasonably
level-headed cost-benefit approach in forming attitudes to- wards
military missions.\"28 I relax the claim that costs are always
internalized within democracies, however, arguing that the average
voter\'s share may be much lower than the state\'s per capita costs.
Even in democracies, wealth is not distributed equally within any given
state; the person with median income is less well off than someone
possessing the mean. A political-economic approach, the Meltzer-Richard
hypothesis, suggests that if the median voter can set a tax rate and
spend the revenue on a service available to all citizens, she will take
advantage of the potential for re- distribution.29 Even with a flat tax
on income, the wealthy will pay a larger portion of the costs for a
public good enjoyed by all. For example, in 2005 the fifth of the
population with the highest incomes paid 69 percent of all U.S. fed-
eral tax revenue, and the middle fifth paid only 9 percent.30 Similarly,
[the median voter will prefer [to tax capital more heavily]{.mark} than
labor, because labor income is distributed more equally than capital
income]{.underline}.31 How these taxes are spent plays a most important
role in establishing the redistributive nature of the public good of
defense. [[Military doctrine]{.mark}, the means by which military power
is developed and exercised, can be stylized as a production function
[consist]{.mark}ing [of **two factors**]{.mark} -
**[capital]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., **[tanks, planes, ammunition,
and even training]{.underline}**) [[and labor]{.mark}
(**soldiers**]{.underline}, sailors, etc.) - as well as the technology
that allows one factor of production to serve as a substitute for
another.32 Capital and labor are imperfect replacements and show
diminishing returns; given a hundred tanks and ten soldiers, adding
another tank will not produce as much capability as adding another
soldier. The type of conflict af- fects substitutions as well; it is
much harder to substitute capital for labor when fighting an
unconventional opponent. Tax revenue can pay for both the capital and
labor inputs. Personnel also can be supplied through conscription, a tax
on a citizen\'s labor rather than income. [[Even if]{.mark} the [odds of
being conscripted are equal]{.mark}ly distributed, [the median voter
will demand]{.mark} that a larger amount of the [military budget go
toward]{.mark} the purchase of [capital to reduce]{.mark} the
[risk]{.mark} of conscription. In cases where existing threats do not
currently justify resorting to conscription]{.underline}, [military
capitalization will still to a large degree determine a draft\'s future
likelihood]{.underline}. The median voter normally will be happy with an
expensive, all-volunteer military; but once the level of threat creates
a demand for labor that reaches into the middle class, the voter will
support a conscripted military where draftees are protected by large
amounts of capital.33 [Casualties are also a public bad: no one wants to
see their fellow citizens die]{.underline}. The less wealthy are more
likely to be drafted and to join an all-volunteer force; they may gain
jobs from domestic weapons manufacturing; and they of- ten regard
military service as a means of acquiring human capital. Conscription is
therefore an important, but not the only, reason why militaries with
large amounts of labor can be a public bad. The median voter will accept
a higher tax, what the British socialist Sidney Webb called the
\"conscription of riches,\" to build highly capitalized militaries both
in peace and in war, because such militaries redistribute money and
skills through jobs and training as well as reduce the risk of
conscription and casualties. The median voter theory outlined above does
not claim to perfectly capture how policy is made in a democracy, nor
does it argue that one\'s relative in- come determines one\'s position
on foreign policy. Rather, this simple theory suggests an equally simple
insight: a military doctrine that privileges capital over labor will
reduce the costs of conflict for an important swath of voters. A
capitalized military not only results in many voters doing less of the
fighting themselves, but also allows someone else\'s resources to fund
the costs of war. **[[Politicians]{.mark} should [respond
accordingly]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This distribution of costs explains
how a state\'s seemingly nonstrategic behavior may be in the interests
of important rational actors within a democracy. Because of its
redistributive nature, [a [capitalized military doctrine]{.mark} can
[lead to **moral hazard**]{.mark},]{.underline} [which arises when
perverse incentives encourage actors to pursue risky
behavior]{.underline}. For example, drivers with auto theft coverage are
more likely to park on the street than pay for secure parking. Many
domestic gov- ernment programs merge moral hazard with the
Meltzer-Richard effect dis- cussed above. Deposit insurance uses
government backing to insure bank deposits up to a certain limit, a
redistributive public good. Because the insur- ance applies regardless
of the bank (subject to government regulations), an individual has
little motivation to consider the bank\'s solvency. Indeed, she is
likely to choose the higher interest provided by a bank making risky
investments. [**Regarding defense provision, a [lack of cost
internalization creates]{.mark} an [incentive for the]{.mark} median
[voter to support risky behavior]{.mark}**[:]{.mark} that is,
[using]{.mark} a [capital- intensive military in conflicts where
**substitutability is low**]{.mark} because the decreased likelihood of
winning is outweighed by the lower costs of fighting in such a
manner.]{.underline} [If the median voter\'s risky behavior is in effect
being subsidized by the wealthy, [democratic leaders sensitive
to]{.mark} this [voter\'s costs]{.mark} will [pursue strategies that
make success less likely]{.mark}]{.underline}. [I]{.underline} argue
that this is what happened in Vietnam.

### I/L War -- Interventionism

[Liberal hegemony is]{.underline} an ambitious [strategy in which a
state aims to turn as many countries as possible into liberal
democracies]{.underline} like itself while also promoting an open
international economy and building international institutions. In
essence, the liberal state seeks to spread its own values far and wide.
My goal in this book is to describe what happens when a power­ful state
pursues this strategy at the expense of balance­-of­-power politics. [Many
i]{.underline}n the West, especially among foreign policy elites,
[consider liberal hegemony a wise policy that states should
axiomatically adopt.]{.underline} Spreading liberal democracy around the
world is said to make eminently good sense from both a moral and a
strategic perspective. For starters, it is thought to be an excellent
way to protect human rights, which are sometimes seri­ously violated by
authoritarian states. And because the [policy holds that liberal
democracies do not want to go to war with each other]{.underline}, it
ultimately provides a formula for transcending realism and fostering
international peace. Finally, proponents claim it helps protect
liberalism at home by eliminating authoritarian states that otherwise
might aid the illiberal forces that are constantly present inside the
liberal state. [This conventional wisdom is wrong. Great powers are
rarely in a position to pursue a full­-scale liberal foreign
policy.]{.underline} As long as two or more of them exist on the planet,
they have little choice but to pay close attention to their position in
the global balance of power and act according to the dictates of
realism[. Great powers of all persuasions care deeply about their
survival]{.underline}, and there is always the danger in a bipolar or
multipolar system that they will be attacked by another great power. In
these circumstances, liberal great powers regularly dress up their
hard­-nosed behavior with liberal rhe­toric. They talk like liberals and
act like realists. Should they adopt liberal policies that are at odds
with realist logic, they invariably come to regret it[. But occasionally
a liberal democracy encounters such a favorable balance of power that it
is able to embrace liberal hegemony.]{.underline} That situation is most
likely to arise in a unipolar world, where the single great power does
not have to worry about being attacked by another great power since
there is none. Then the liberal sole pole will almost always abandon
realism and adopt a liberal foreign policy. Liberal states have a
crusader mentality hard­-wired into them that is hard to restrain.
Because liberalism prizes the concept of inalienable or natural rights,
committed liberals are deeply concerned about the rights of virtually
every individual on the planet. [This universalist logic creates a
powerful incen­tive for liberal states to get involved in the affairs of
countries that seriously violate their citizens' rights.]{.underline} To
take this a step further, the best way to ensure that the rights of
foreigners are not trampled is for them to live in a liberal democracy.
This [logic **leads straight to an active policy of regime change**,
where the goal is to topple autocrats and put liberal
democracies]{.underline} in their place. Liberals do not shy from this
task, mainly because they often have great faith in their state's
ability to do social engineering both at home and abroad. Creating a
world populated by liberal democracies is also thought to be a formula
for international peace, which would not just eliminate war but greatly
reduce, if not eliminate, the twin scourges of nuclear prolifera­tion and
terrorism. And lastly, it is an ideal way of protecting liberalism at
home. This enthusiasm notwithstanding, [liberal hegemony will not
achieve its goals, and its failure will inevitably come with huge costs.
**The liberal state is likely to end up in endless wars, which will
increase rather than reduce the level of conflict in international
politics and thus aggravate the problems of proliferation and
terrorism**]{.underline}. Moreover, the state's militaristic behavior is
almost certain to end up threatening its own liberal values. Liber­alism
abroad leads to illiberalism at home. Finally, even [if the liberal
state were to achieve its aims---spreading democracy near and far,
fostering eco­nomic intercourse, and creating international
institutions---they would not produce peace]{.underline}. The key to
understanding liberalism's limits is to recognize its relation­ship with
nationalism and realism. This book is ultimately all about these three
isms and how they interact to affect international politics

#### Democracy promotion locks-in [permanent instability]{.underline} and [inevitably fails]{.underline} due to [US hypocrisy]{.underline} 

**Walt 16**, (John Walt, Professor of International Affairs at the
Harvard Kennedy School, "The Case for Offshore Balancing: A Superior
U.S. Grand Strategy," Foreign Affairs, August 2016,

ME)

Other critics reject offshore balancing because they believe the United
States has a moral and strategic imperative to promote freedom and
protect human rights. As they see it, spreading democracy will largely
rid the world of war and atrocities, keeping the United States secure
and alleviating suffering. [No one knows if a world composed solely of
liberal democracies would in fact prove peaceful, but spreading
democracy at the point of a gun rarely works, and fledgling democracies
are especially prone to conflict]{.underline}. Instead of promoting
peace, [the United States just ends up fighting endless
wars.]{.underline} Even worse, [force-feeding liberal values abroad can
compromise them at home. The global war on terrorism and the related
effort to implant democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq have led to tortured
prisoners, targeted killings, and vast electronic surveillance of U.S.
citizens.]{.underline} Some defenders of liberal hegemony hold that a
subtler version of the strategy could avoid the sorts of disasters that
occurred in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. They are deluding themselves.
[**Democracy promotion requires large-scale social engineering in
foreign societies that Americans understand poorly, which helps explain
why Washington\'s efforts usually fail. Dismantling and replacing
existing political institutions inevitably creates winners and losers,
and the latter often take up arms in opposition**. When that happens,
U.S. officials,]{.underline} believing their country\'s credibility is
now at stake, [are tempted to use the United States\' awesome military
might to fix the problem, thus drawing the country into more
conflicts.]{.underline}

#### Liberalism is [*inherently* destabilizing]{.underline}---democratic pursuit [inevitably]{.underline} leads to [expansionism]{.underline}

**Humpal 20** -- Active Duty Air Force Officer and Ph.D. Candidate at
Northwestern University studying insurgent behavior, civil wars, and
global norms (Jesse, 6-23-2020, "Liberal Internationalism, an Ideology
of Violence", Global Security Review,
https://globalsecurityreview.com/liberal-internationalism-ideology-of-violence/,
accessed 7-2-2020) //DYang

During the presidency of George W. Bush, the administration's cabinet
and top advisors were an eclectic mix of liberal [internationalists and
neoconservatives]{.underline}. The thing these two ideologies have in
common is their [lust for foreign interference.]{.underline} At the
surface their objectives were different, but [at their
core]{.underline}, they [believed]{.underline} the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [should have a grand strategy of dominant
manipulation on the world stage.]{.underline} [In invading Afghanistan
and then Iraq, liberal hegemonic rhetoric was shouted as not only
justification for war but as a divine duty of the United States as the
world's sole hegemon.]{.underline} It was [common to hear Bush and his
team promote ideas such as the democratic peace theory, and the duty to
liberate the veiled Afghani women under Taliban control.]{.underline}
**[Although one can easily get behind democratic peace or the liberation
of women, these were little more than post hoc justifications for
invading sovereign nation-states. This is the unfortunate reality;
liberalism is an expansionist ideology that inevitably does more harm
than good.]{.underline}** The Core Assumptions of Liberalism At its base
level, liberalism emphasizes inalienable rights and individuality. From
this baseline, thinkers have developed theories and ideas about how
these rights should be manifested. The conclusion is at the crux of
whether liberalism acts as an expansionist ideology or not. Although one
could trace liberalism quite far back in historical political thought,
John Locke acts as a cornerstone of the philosophy. Importantly, [Locke
lays the groundwork in Two Treaties of Government that all men are in "a
state of perfect freedom," that is to say, that humans have natural or
inalienable rights.]{.underline}1 Although different thinkers have come
to different conclusions of the type of liberalism that is dominant. In
the American case, which will be the primary subject for the remainder
of this piece, progressive liberalism and its emphasis on positive
rights is the only dominant strand. [According to John
Mearsheimer]{.underline} in The Great Delusion: Liberal Dreams and
International Realities, [this is true for three reasons: The Industrial
Revolution, nationalism, and modern peacetime militaries]{.underline}.2
Since the United States is the sole world superpower and also subscribes
to modern liberalism, the next section will explore how those two
characteristics make liberalism incredibly expansionist in its aims.
**[Liberalism is Inherently Expansionist]{.underline}** To first explain
why liberalism is inherently expansionist, one must understand how
important the concept of inalienable rights is too liberal thinkers. It
is through this understanding that the other layers form[. If one
believes, as liberals do, in inalienable rights, it means that everyone
in the world has the same inherent set of rights.]{.underline} This is
so important to internalize as a concept because of what this belief
drives a country to do. For instance, [if the fundamental principle is
that each human has the same rights, then there is inevitably a duty to
ensure that these rights are protected. **It is from this duty that
humans feel a calling, and eventually, a nation-state can be provoked to
meddle.** The American view of liberalism and its focus on positive
rights results in social engineering.]{.underline} Social engineering
manifests itself through policies aimed at leveling the playing field.
On the domestic side, an example of this would be affirmative action.
This policy manipulates the playing field in order to give a group who
is historically disadvantaged a fairer opportunity. This is done at the
expense of negative rights. Since people within a nation have more in
common with each other than they do with people of other nations, it is
possible to agree on foundational rights within the confines of one's
borders. For example, [in the United States, the Bill of Rights is
mostly noncontroversial. However, since each nation-state has its own
identity, agreeing on foundational rights between states, or worse,
globally is all but impossible.]{.underline} However, **[many liberals
feel confident that they can project positive rights aboard. It is from
this confidence that nation-states begin to feel obligated to intervene
in places that rights are threatened.]{.underline}** Even though [a
desire to meddle and optimism of success is in the DNA of liberal
internationalists]{.underline}, they frequently lack the number one
characteristic needed for liberal hegemonic pursuit, unipolarity. For
most of the modern world, the globe existed with multiple superpowers.
In a world with more than one superpower, countries' foreign policies
were preoccupied with survival. Since there is not a global state, the
nation-state is the highest level of authority. In a multipolar world,
nation-states are required to operate using a realist strategy. This
strategy forces countries to balance, position, and align themselves in
a rational way. However, [in 1991, and the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the United States found itself without a rival. This unipolar world gave
the liberal United States the rare opportunity to pursue any foreign
policy strategy they wanted without fear of attack or significant
pushback.]{.underline} Thus far, it has been established that liberal
internationalists believe in global inalienable rights and that these
rights are positive in nature thus requiring social engineering.
Further, they have profound confidence in their own ability to execute
global social engineering. Now, as the lone global power, the United
States is unencumbered in its choice of foreign policy strategy. With
all of this in place, according to liberal logic, one has the duty to
protect and enforce the rights of others. From this duty, the next
question is how is this accomplished? Despite the liberal
internationalist fascination with international organizations, it is
interesting that the policies of those institutions mirror that of the
dominant state. [With the United States being that state, the United
Nations and NATO have taken their lead in liberal projection and have
acted as a puppet organization.]{.underline} By the logic presented, it
is unreasonable not to promote rights abroad if able. Now that the
United States is able, that is exactly what they have done. Also, as
established above, international organizations are part of the bedrock
of liberal internationalism. It is through the ruse of these
organizations that the United States can act under the veil of
legitimacy. With these two pillars, the United States the state, and the
United States the United Nations, numerous interventions have been
waged, and there is no logical conclusion, with the exception of the
emergence of another superpower. **[As the unipolar power, the United
States not only has tried to liberalize several countries as the
dominant front but has also led non-U.S. participant resolutions in the
U.N. which started violent interventions.]{.underline}** [An example of
this is the AMISOM run intervention in Somalia. While the United States
is not a direct participant, they fronted and legitimized this effort
using the international community.]{.underline}3 **[It's illogical for
liberalism as a foreign policy to be non-expansionist and has proven
itself to be very expansionist.]{.underline}** [If inalienable rights
are real, then how can a liberal internationalist not protect those
rights abroad, even if it is through violence.]{.underline} It is from
this paradox that one should understand that **[despite the peaceful
façade, liberalism as a foreign policy is not only inherently
expansionist but innately violent.]{.underline}**

### I/L War -- Security Dilemma 

#### DPT is empirically denied -- democracies demonize non-democracies -- ensures hair trigger security dilemma

[My]{.underline} own [proposal]{.underline} for solving the problem.
developed together with my colleague Jonas Wolff (Müllcr 2004.
Muller/Wolff 2006). **[turns the issue upside down]{.underline}**: [We
do not start with explaining mutual democratic
peacefulness]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} its opposite. [the proven
capability of [democracies]{.mark} to **[act
aggressively]{.mark}**]{.underline} [against
non-democracies]{.underline}. We note that---[[apart from
**self-defense**]{.underline}]{.mark} [where [there is no
difference]{.mark} between democracies and
non-democracies]{.underline}------**[[democratic states go to
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[in contrast to
non-democracies]{.underline}---[[to uphold **i**]{.mark}**nternational
[law]{.mark}**]{.underline} (or their own interpretation thereof), **[to
[prevent anarchy]{.mark}]{.underline}** through state failure, [to
**"save strangers"**]{.underline} when dictatorships massacre their own
people, [[and to **promote democracy**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [None of
these acts is likely to find its target in a democracy]{.underline}.
Since the use of force by democracies is hardly possible without public

stand public scrutiny when uttered against a democracy---people will not
believe it, [[War **other than**]{.mark} **for [self-defense]{.mark}**
[thus can only be fought **by democracies**]{.mark}]{.underline} against
non-democracies [because **against a fellow democracy** justification
**would fail**]{.underline}. Because whether this is the case or not to
a degree that justifies war as the 'ultimate means" must rely on
practical judgments. and practical judgments can differ among even
reasonable people. democracies might disagree whether or not the
judgment applies in specific cases. Democracies also show variance in
that regard due (o a systematic. political-culturally rooted different
propensity to judge situations as justifing war or not, and to
participate in such wars (Gels et al, 2013). It should also be noted
that, given the continuum between autocracy, anocracy and democracy,
whether a given state is a democracy or not can be subject to
interpretation. and this interpretation may even change over time (Oren
1995, Hayes 2013). The fact is that there are a couple of fairly warlike
democracies, and that the democracies participating most frequently in
military disputes (apart from the special case of Israel) are, by and
large. major powers such as the United States, the United Kingdom.
France. or India. This pattern is important to keep in mind when the
question of the utility of democratic peace for today 's world problems
is to be answered. Transnational terrorism, failed states, civil wars
and the like dominate the international agenda on war and peace. At the
classical level of international relations, in the relationships among
major powers. developments arc undcr way which potentially pose an even
greater threat than this diverse collection of non-interstate problems
presently does. [We are living in an era of rather rapid and disturbing
power change]{.underline} (Tammcn et al. 2000). The United States are
still the leading power of the world with unprecedented militany and
economic poer. But others are coming closer: China. India. Braiil and
Indonesia, China is at the top of this cohort, All major power changes

disturbance. The leading power may start to fear for its dominant
position and take measures to ensure its position at the lop. These
actions may frustrate emerging powers and even lead to the perception
that their security is endangered. which would motivate counter-measures
that further propel a political escala tion spiral. An increasingly
focused competition in which a true power change appears increasingly
possible. that is. a change of position at the top of the international
hierarchy, has an even greater risk potential. If the inherent dangers
are not contained---which remains always a possibility major power war
may ensue defying all propositions that major war has become obsolete or
that nuclear deterrence will prevent this calamity once and for all. Of
course, states can grow peacefully into roles of higher responsibility.
status and influence on the world stage. There arc no natural laws
saving that changes in the world's power structure must end in war,
despite all distur bances and ensuing risks (Rauch 2014). The less
conflict an emerging power experiences with established ones, and with
peer challengers that emerge simultaneously, the better the chances that
the rise will travel a peaceful trajectory. Looking through this lens.
thc relations of only one emerging power with the present hegemon appear
to be partially conflict-pronc. and seriously so: it concerns the pair
China/United States. The Iwo great powers are rivals for preponderance
in East and South East Asia and eventually for being the number one at
the global level. There is also Chinese resentment stemming from the US
role in China's past as a victim of Western imperialism. On the other
hand. China's authoritarian system of rule and ensuing violations of
human and political rights trigger the liberal resentment discussed in
the first part of this chapter. which is rooted particularly strongly in
US political culture. The Chinese---US relationship is thus thc key to a
peaceful. tense or even violent future at the world stage. A small group
of [major powers]{.underline}. Including the United States and China, is

### I/L War -- Median Voter

#### US and Israel prove -- citizen preferences for a capital-intensive military doctrine lock in aggressive foreign policy and protracted warfare -- legal reforms fail. 

**Caverley 10** -- Jonathan, Poli Sci Prof @ NU, The Myth of Military
Myopia: Democracy, Small Wars, and Vietnam, International Security 34.3.

This article shows that, contrary to the consensus regarding U.S.
military intransigence in the face of unconventional warfare, [civilian
officials in Lyndon Johnson\'s administration - and ultimately the
American public - played an essential role in the selection of a
capital-intensive strategy to fight insurgents in the Vietnam
War]{.underline}. President Johnson was convinced that the American
public would punish any administration that \"lost\" South Vietnam to
communism, but he was equally certain that public preferences
constrained the number of U.S. forces to be deployed and lives to be
lost far more than the amount of money to be spent and ordnance to be
consumed. In response, he and his sub- ordinates instructed the military
to fight what they themselves acknowledged to be an ineffective,
capital- and firepower-intensive strategy. The article ex- plains this
seemingly nonstrategic behavior using a theory, generalizable be- yond
this specific case, of the distribution of the costs of war within the
electorate.138 [[Israel\'s experience]{.mark} in its 2006 war against
Hezbollah [suggests]{.mark} that [this]{.mark} phenomenon [is not
limited to]{.mark} the [Vietnam]{.mark} War]{.underline} or to U.S.
strategic culture.139 Israel expended 170,000 artillery shells, twice
the number fired in the conve tional 1973 Arab-Israeli War, in a
month.140 The Israel Defense Force\'s (IDF\'s) initial campaign plan - a
rapid air and small-unit ground assault that relied on firepower to
control territory - was designed to minimize the number of ground forces
and casualties. The Israeli cabinet rejected it; the transportation
minister objected to \"exposing 40,000 troops to the Lebanese
reality.\"141 Four days into the conflict, the IDF deputy chief of staff
recommended stopping the campaign: \"We have exhausted the \[aerial\]
effort; we have reached the peak; from now on we can only descend.\"142
Nonetheless, despite its intention to avoid a ground war, the Israeli
government announced ambitious goals far beyond releasing hostages and
deterring further rocket attacks.143 A report written by a subsequent
government commission describing the strategic co- nundrum evokes the
constraints faced by Johnson in Vietnam: \"[Declared [goals were too
ambitious]{.mark}, and it was publicly stated that fighting will
continue till they are achieved. But the authorized [military operations
did not enable]{.mark} their [achievement]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} The
report acknowledges the government\'s bind: no \"other ef- fective
military response to such missile attacks than an extensive and pro-
longed ground operation\" existed, but this \"would have a high \'cost\'
and did not enjoy broad support.\"144 Cost distribution theory makes
such behavior explicable. From four ma- jor assumptions - [security is a
public good; [voters weigh security benefits against]{.mark} taxes,
conscription, and [casualties]{.mark}; median wealth is less than mean
wealth in every state; and the preferences of the median voter are
heeded [in]{.mark} a [democracy]{.mark} - **I derive [a]{.mark} voter
[preference for a capitalized military]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Like the
democratic exceptionalist research program, this article finds evidence
that the American public weighs the benefits of limited war against the
costs. Although one recent study of American public opinion assigns
expectations of success as the most important factor in the public\'s
support for a conflict, it also points out that the public more
generally carries out relatively competent cost-benefit analysis.145
This article extends this logic by arguing that when the ability to
substitute matériel for personnel is low, as it is against
unconventional opponents, [[democracies]{.mark} may still [prosecute
wars using]{.mark} an [ill-suited]{.mark} military [doctrine]{.mark}
(and [thus a lower chance of success]{.mark}), because the costs remain
modest for this pivotal voter.]{.underline} [Democratic
[exceptionalism\'s]{.mark} cost-[internalization mechanism provides an
overly optimistic assessment of]{.mark} democracies\' discretion in
**[how and]{.mark} even [when]{.mark}** [they fight]{.mark} small
wars.]{.underline} Neither an apolitical public, nor a dysfunctional
military culture, nor a military doctrine divorced from grand strategy
causes a flawed warfighting strategy. Rather, [it results from political
leaders\' assessment of the average voter\'s preferences]{.underline}.
Although claiming that democracies substitute capital for labor to
reduce the costs of war for voters is not news, tying the pur- suit of
such a strategy to a rational voter has two novel and important
implications. First, many observers argue that most wars of the
twenty-first century will be hybrid conflicts involving unconventional
opponents; finding the root cause of poor counterinsurgency is an
essential task. This article argues that [fixating on reforming the
armed services]{.underline} (or even the civilian tools of foreign
policy) [in an effort to improve democratic performance in small wars
**is [its own]{.mark} form of [myopia]{.mark}**.]{.underline} My theory
gives reason to be skeptical of how much the U.S. military will be
allowed to shift by future administrations and the public to which they
are held accountable. Dysfunctional organizations can eventu- ally learn
and adapt. If the public suffers from foolish preconceptions, it may be
dissuaded through public education and the marketplace of ideas. Even
positing a powerful strategic culture underpinning U.S. doctrine
suggests that \"it is at least possible that by deconstructing the
standard American \'way\' . . . some pathways to improved performance
may be identified.\"146 **[But [if a rational]{.mark}, fully [informed
electorate views such]{.mark} a military doctrine [as its best
option]{.mark}, the [prospects for change are less
clear]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### AT: DPT

#### DPT is wrong -- theorist conflate causation and correlation -- demo promo is the greatest cause of modern war

[Clinging to the assumption]{.underline} that [only dictatorships start
military conflicts]{.underline}, [proponents of democratization believed
that the global success]{.underline} of their project would [usher in a
world without wa]{.underline}r. But [this theory **lacks a sound
foundation and**]{.underline} has [produced one **disaster after
another**]{.underline} when put into practice.

LONDON -- Through persuasion, exhortation, legal processes, economic
pressure, and sometimes military force, [American foreign policy asserts
the United States']{.underline} [view about how the world should be
run.]{.underline} Only two countries in recent history have had such
world-transforming ambitions: Britain and the US. In the last 150 years,
these are the only two countries whose power -- hard and soft, formal
and informal -- has extended to all parts of the world, allowing them
plausibly to aspire to the mantle of Rome.

When the US inherited Britain's global position after 1945, it also
inherited Britain's sense of responsibility for the future of the
international order. Embracing that role, [America has been an
evangelist of democracy]{.underline}, and a centr[al US foreign-policy
objective]{.underline} since the fall of communism has been [to promote
its spread]{.underline} -- sometimes **[by regime change]{.underline}**,
when that is deemed necessary.

In fact, this playbook dates back to US President Woodrow Wilson's time.
As historian Nicholas Mulder writes in The Economic Weapon: The Rise of
Sanctions as a Tool of Modern War, "Wilson was the first statesman to
cast the economic weapon as an instrument of democratization. He thereby
added an internal political rationale for economic sanctions --
spreading democracy -- to the external political goal that...European
advocates of sanctions have aimed at: inter-state peace." The
implication is that, where the opportunity offers, military and
non-military measures should be used to topple "malign" regimes.

[According to democratic peace theory, democracies do not start
wars;]{.underline} only dictatorships do. [A wholly democratic world
thus would be a world without war]{.underline}. This was the hope that
emerged in the 1990s. With the end of communism, the expectation,
famously expressed by Francis Fukuyama's 1989 article, "The End of
History?," was that the most important parts of the world would become
democratic.

US supremacy was supposed to ensure that democracy became the universal
political norm. But [Russia and China, the]{.underline} leading
communist states of the Cold War era, **[have not embraced
it]{.underline}**; nor have many other centers of world affairs,
especially in the Middle East. Hence, Fukuyama has recently acknowledged
that [if Russia and China were driven together,]{.underline} "**[then
you would really be living in a world that was being dominated by these
non-democratic powers]{.underline}**...\[which\] really is the end of
the end of history."

[The argument that democracy is inherently "peaceful]{.underline},"
[and]{.underline} dictatorship or [autocracy "warlike]{.underline}," [is
intuitively attractive]{.underline}. It does not deny that states pursue
their own interests; but it assumes that the interests of democratic
states will reflect common values like human rights, and that those
interests will be pursued in a less bellicose manner (since democratic
processes require negotiation of differences). Democratic governments
are accountable to their people, and the people have an interest in
peace, not war.

By contrast, according to this view, rulers and elites in dictatorships
are illegitimate and therefore insecure, which leads them to seek
popular support by whipping up animosity toward foreigners. If democracy
replaced dictatorship everywhere, world peace would follow
automatically.

[This belief rests on two propositions that have been extremely
influential in international relations theory, even though they are
poorly grounded theoretically and empirically. The first is the notion
that a state's external behavior is determined by its domestic
constitution -- a view that ignores the influence the international
system can have on a country's domestic politics]{.underline}. As the
American political scientist Kenneth N. Waltz argued in his 1979 book,
The Theory of International Politics, "[international anarchy"
conditions the behavior of states more than the behavior of states
creates international anarchy.]{.underline}

Waltz's "world-systems theory" perspective is particularly useful in an
age of globalization. One must look to the structure of the
international system to "predict" how individual states will behave,
regardless of their domestic constitutions. "If each state, being
stable, strove only for security, and had no designs on its neighbors,
all states would nevertheless remain insecure," he observed, "for the
means of security for one state are, in their very existence, the means
by which other states are threatened."

Waltz offered a bracing antidote to the facile assumption that
democratic habits are easily transferable from one location to another.
Rather than trying to spread democracy, he suggested that it would be
better to try to reduce global insecurity.

[Though there is undeniably some correlation between democratic
institutions and peaceful habits,]{.underline} [the direction of
causation is disputable]{.underline}. [Was it democracy that made Europe
peaceful after 1945?]{.underline} **[Or did the US nuclear
umbrella]{.underline}**, the [fixing of borders]{.underline} by the
victors, [and Marshall Plan-fueled economic growth]{.underline} finally
make it possible for non-communist Europe to accept democracy as its
political norm? The political scientist Mark E. Pietrzyk contends that,
"[Only states which are relatively secure -- politically, militarily,
economically -- can afford to have free, pluralistic
societies;]{.underline} in the absence of this security, states are much
more likely to adopt, maintain, or revert to centralized, coercive
authority structures."

The second proposition is that democracy is the natural form of the
state, which people everywhere will spontaneously adopt if allowed to.
This dubious assumption makes regime change seem easy, because the
sanctioning powers can rely on the welcoming support of those whose
freedom has been repressed and whose rights have been trampled
underfoot.

By drawing superficial comparisons with postwar Germany and Japan, the
apostles of democratization grossly underestimate the difficulties of
installing democracies in societies that lack Western constitutional
traditions. The results of their handiwork can be seen in Iraq,
Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, and many African countries.

[Democratic peace theory is]{.underline}, above all,
**[lazy]{.underline}**. [It provides an easy explanation for "warlike"
behavior without considering **the location and history of the states
involved**]{.underline}. This shallowness lends itself to overconfidence
that a quick dose of economic sanctions or bombing is all that is needed
to cure a dictatorship of its unfortunate affliction.

In short, [the idea that democracy is "portable"]{.underline} **[leads
to a gross underestimation of the military, economic, and humanitarian
costs]{.underline}** [of trying to spread democracy]{.underline} to
troubled parts of the world. [The West has paid a **terrible price for
such thinking**]{.underline} -- and it may be about to pay again.

## CLIMATE

### 1nc -- Climate

#### Democracy terminally slows warming mitigation\-\--[extinction]{.underline}

**Abadi 22 ---** Cameron Abadi deputy editor at Foreign Policy., "What
if Democracy and Climate Mitigation Are Incompatible?," Foreign Policy,
8-7-2021,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/01/07/climate-change-democracy/, accessed

In the past 14 months, the United States and Germany both held national
elections that placed climate change policy squarely at the center of
national debate. The fact that two of the world's five largest economies
committed to addressing the world's most pressing crisis through public
discourse followed by public voting was an unprecedented [democratic
experiment]{.underline}.

It **[did not work out as optimists hoped]{.underline}**. On the one
hand, the [victorious parties]{.underline} in both countries [vowed to
achieve what was necessary]{.underline} to prevent the worst effects of
climate change from occurring, in accordance with the international
climate agreement unanimously approved in Paris in 2015. But on the
other hand, in [neither country]{.underline} can the resulting policies
be described as **[fulfilling that promise]{.underline}**.

[All the major German parties]{.underline} (except for the far-right
Alternative for Germany) [said they would work to limit climate
change]{.underline} to the 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial
levels stipulated in the Paris Agreement; the Greens claimed, plausibly,
that only their platform contained ideas sufficient to fulfill the
promise. But [even as the Greens succeeded]{.underline} at joining the
national government (having earned a record-breaking 15 percent at the
polls), [few of the **policy specifics** found their way into the
governing agenda]{.underline} for the next four years. The Greens
claimed a higher carbon price was necessary; no mention of any such
increase made it into the coalition agreement. The Greens argued that
ending the domestic excavation of coal by 2030 was nonnegotiable; the
government has failed to make a firm commitment to do that. The Greens
claimed the country would need to invest an extra 50 billion euros (\$56
billion) per year in renewable energy infrastructure; the new government
has vowed instead to maintain a balanced budget.

A similar slippage between campaign ambition and watered-down governance
has occurred in the United States. Democrat Joe [Biden's election
platform vowed]{.underline} that the [country's electricity sector would
be carbon-free]{.underline} by 2035 and that [the entire U.S. economy
would achieve full carbon neutrality]{.underline} by 2050---promises
that the Biden administration has never disavowed. [But the central
policies intended to achieve those timelines]{.underline} **[have no
realistic chance of passing Congress.]{.underline}** The administration
will receive nowhere close to the \$2 trillion that Biden said would be
necessary to fund renewable energy infrastructure. Meanwhile, Sen. Joe
[Manchin]{.underline} from the coal-producing state of West Virginia has
[refused to pass any law that explicitly disincentivizes the energy
sector's use of fossil fuels]{.underline}, as the Biden campaign had
envisioned. At the same time, the Biden administration has openly
lobbied the Middle Eastern oil-producing countries of OPEC to increase
production, in hopes of lowering the price of gasoline for domestic
drivers.

The [climate agendas]{.underline} of the current U.S. and German
governments---from the Biden administration's [use of tax incentives to
encourage the expansion of renewable energy]{.underline} to the new
German government's vow to devote 2 percent of the country's land to the
generation of wind power---are not actively harmful. In sum, they will
almost certainly accelerate both countries' reduction of carbon
emissions. [But by any fair accounting,]{.underline} they are
**[inadequate to solving climate change]{.underline}** [on the
**timeline implied**]{.underline} [by]{.underline} the
[Paris]{.underline} Agreement's 1.5-degree commitment---namely, a 50
percent reduction of emissions by 2035 and complete global carbon
neutrality by 2050. "The problem with the climate measures of this new
government is the speed," said Pauline Brünger, a spokesperson for
Germany's Fridays for Future activist group.

Representatives from the U.S. and German governments say their [policies
are the result of the **necessary compromises**]{.underline} [demanded
by the democratic process]{.underline}. But it's fair to wonder whether
t[hat's **just another way of restating the problem**]{.underline}.
According to the climate science, the [timelines to limit warming aren't
an expression of subjectively perceived urgency]{.underline} but
**[objective measures defined by the boundary of a catastrophic climate
tipping point.]{.underline}** In a 2018 report, the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC]{.underline}), a U.N. group of climate
scientists, [declared that achieving carbon neutrality by midcentury was
the only way to prevent global temperatures from rising above
1.5]{.underline} degrees---beyond which, **[Arctic ice would
melt]{.underline}** (**[and ocean levels]{.underline}** would
**[rise]{.underline}**) far more quickly, [humans would more frequently
suffer heat death]{.underline}, and vast numbers of species, from
insects to sea coral, would **[end up on the verge of
extinction.]{.underline}**

In other words: [Democracy works by **compromise**]{.underline}, [but
climate change is precisely the type of problem that seems **not to
allow for it.**]{.underline} [As the clock on those climate timelines
continues to tick]{.underline}, this **[structural
mismatch]{.underline}** [is becoming increasingly exposed]{.underline}.
And as a result, those concerned by climate change---some already with
political power, others grasping for it---are now searching for, and
finding, new ways of closing the gap between politics and science, by
any means necessary.

In 2016, the World Economic Forum survey of the most impactful risks for
the years ahead elevated the failure of climate change mitigation and
adaptation to the top of the list, ahead of weapons of mass destruction,
ranking second, and water crises, ranking third. By 2018, following a
year characterised by high-impact hurricanes and extreme temperatures,
extreme-weather events were seen as the single most prominent risk. As
the survey noted: "[We have been **pushing our planet to the brink** and
the damage is becoming **increasingly clear**]{.underline}."^29^
[[Climate change is an **existential risk**]{.mark} to **human
civilisation**]{.underline}: that is, [an adverse outcome that
would]{.underline} either **[annihilate intelligent life]{.underline}**
or permanently and drastically curtail its potential. [Temperature
rises]{.underline} that are now in prospect, **[after]{.underline}** the
**[Paris]{.underline}** Agreement, [are in the range of
**3--5°C**.]{.underline} At present, the Paris Agreement voluntary
emission reduction commitments, if implemented, would result in
planetary warming of 3.4°C by 2100,^30^ without taking into account
"long-term" carbon cycle feedbacks. With a higher climate sensitivity
figure of 4.5°C, for example, which would account for such feedbacks,
the Paris path would result in around 5°C of warming, according to a MIT
study.31 A study by Schroder Investment Management published in June
2017 found -- after taking into account indicators across a wide range
of the political, financial, energy and regulatory sectors -- the
average temperature increase implied for the Paris Agreement across all
sectors was 4.1°C.^32^ Yet [3°C of warming **already constitutes** an
**existential risk.**]{.underline} A 2007 study by two US national
security think-tanks concluded [that 3°C of **[warming]{.mark}** and a
0.5 metre **sea-level rise** [would]{.mark} likely [lead to]{.mark}
"**outright [chaos]{.mark}**" [and]{.mark} "**[nuclear war]{.mark}** is
**possible**",]{.underline} emphasising how "massive non-linear [events
in the **global environment** give rise to **massive nonlinear societal
events**]{.underline}".^33^ The Global Challenges Foundation (GCF)
explains what could happen: "[If climate change was to reach 3°C, most
of Bangladesh and Florida would **drown**, while **major [coastal
cities]{.mark}** -- Shanghai, Lagos, Mumbai -- [would be
**swamped**]{.mark}]{.underline}, likely [[creating]{.mark} **large
flows** of **[climate refugees]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Most regions in
the world would see a **significant drop in food production** and
increasing]{.underline} numbers of **[extreme weather
events]{.underline}**, whether heat waves, floods or storms. This likely
scenario for a 3°C rise does not take into account the considerable risk
that [**self-reinforcing [feedback loops]{.mark}** [set in]{.mark} when
a certain **threshold** is reached, leading to an **ever increasing
rise** in temperature]{.underline}. [Potential thresholds include the
melting of the **Arctic permafrost** releasing **methane** into the
atmosphere, **forest dieback**]{.underline} releasing the carbon
currently stored in the Amazon and boreal forests, [or the **melting**
of **polar ice caps**]{.underline} that would no longer reflect away
light and heat from the sun."^34^ [Warming]{.underline} of 4°C or more
could reduce the global human population by 80% or 90%,^35^ and the
World Bank reports "[there is **no certainty** that **adaptation** to a
**4°C world is possible**]{.underline}".^36^ Prof. Kevin Anderson says
[a 4°C future]{.underline} "[is **incompatible with an organized global
community**, is likely to be **beyond 'adaptation'**, is **devastating**
to]{.underline} the majority of **[ecosystems]{.underline}**, and has a
high probability of not being stable".^37^ This is a commonly-held
sentiment amongst climate scientists. A recent study by the European
Commission's Joint Research Centre found that if the global temperature
rose 4°C, then extreme heatwaves with "apparent temperatures" peaking at
over 55°C will begin to regularly affect many densely populated parts of
the world, forcing much activity in the modern industrial world to
stop.^38^ ("Apparent temperatures" refers to the Heat Index, which
quantifies the combined effect of heat and humidity to provide people
with a means of avoiding dangerous conditions.) In 2017, one of the
first research papers to focus explicitly on existential climate risks
proposed that "mitigation goals be set in terms of climate risk category
instead of a temperature threshold", and established a "dangerous" risk
category of warming greater than 1.5°C, and a "catastrophic" category
for warming of 3°C or more. The authors focussed on the impacts on the
world's poorest three billion people, on health and heat stress, and the
impacts of climate extremes on such people with limited adaptation
resources. They found that a 2°C warming "would double the land area
subject to deadly heat and expose 48% of the population (to deadly
heat). A 4°C warming by 2100 would subject 47% of the land area and
almost 74% of the world population to deadly heat, which could pose
existential risks to humans and mammals alike unless massive adaptation
measures are implemented."^39^ A 2017 survey of global catastrophic
risks by the Global Challenges Foundation found that: "[In **high-end
\[climate\] scenarios**, the scale of destruction is **beyond our
capacity to model**, with a high likelihood of human civilization
**coming to an end**]{.underline}."^40^ [84% of 8000 people in eight
countries surveyed for the Foundation considered climate change a
"global catastrophic risk".]{.underline}^41^ Existential risk may arise
from a fast rate of system change, since [the capacity to
**adapt**,]{.underline} [in both the **natural** and human
**worlds**]{.underline}, [is **inversely proportional to the pace of
change,**]{.underline} amongst other factors. In 2004, researchers
reported on the rate of warming as a driver of extinction.^42^ Given we
are now on a 3--5°C warming path this century, their findings are
instructive: If the rate of change is 0.3°C per decade (3°C per
century), 15% of ecosystems will not be able to adapt. [If the rate
should exceed 0.4°C per decade, **[all ecosystems will be]{.mark}
quickly [destroyed]{.mark}**, **opportunistic species** will
**dominate**, and the **breakdown** of **biological material** will lead
to **even greater emissions** of CO2]{.underline} At 4°C of warming
"[the **limits for adaptation** for natural systems would largely be
**exceeded**]{.underline} throughout the world".^43^ [**[Ecological
breakdown]{.mark}** of this **scale** [would ensure an **existential
human crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}. By slow degrees, these existential
risks are being recognised. In May 2018, an inquiry by the Australian
Senate into national security and global warming recognised "climate
change as a current and existential national security risk... defined as
'one that threatens the premature extinction of Earth-originating
intelligent life or the permanent and drastic destruction of its
potential for desirable future development'".^44^ In April 2018, the
Intelligence on European Pensions and Institutional Investment
think-tank warned business leaders that "climate change is an
existential risk whose elimination must become a corporate
objective".^45^ However the most recent IPCC Assessment Report did not
consider the issue. Whilst the term "risk management" appears in the
2014 IPCC Synthesis Report fourteen times, the terms "existential" and
"catastrophic" do not appear.

### I/L Climate

#### Democracy will [catastrophically delay]{.underline} action on climate change\-\--authoritarianism is [necessary]{.underline} to ensure rapid state-led transformation 

**Mann & Wainwright '18** (Geoff, teaches political economy and economic
geography at Simon Fraser University, where he directs the Centre for
Global Political Economy, Joel *Climate Leviathan: A Political Theory of
Our Planetary Future*, pp. 38-40, ME)

[Relative to the institutional means currently available to capitalist
liberal democracy and its sorry attempts at "consensus," this trajectory
has some **distinct advantages**]{.underline} [with respect to
atmospheric carbon concentration, notably in terms of the]{.underline}
**[capacity to coordinate massive political-economic reconfiguration
quickly and comprehensively]{.underline}**. In light of our earlier
question---[how can we possibly realize the necessary emissions
reductions?---it is this feature of]{.underline} **[Climate
Mao]{.underline}** [that most recommends it. As the **climate justice
movement struggles to be heard**]{.underline}, [most campaigns in the
global North are premised on an unspoken faith in a lop-sided,
elite-biased, **liberal proceduralism doomed to failure given the scale
and scope of the changes required**]{.underline}. [If climate science is
even half-right in its forecasts, the liberal model of democracy is at
best too slow, at worst a devastating distraction. Climate Mao reflects
the demand for rapid, revolutionary, state-led transformation
today.]{.underline} Indeed, [calls for variations on just such a regime
abound on the Left]{.underline}. Mike [Davis and]{.underline} Giovanni
[Arrighi have more or less sided with Climate Mao, sketching it as an
alternative to capitalist Climate Leviathan]{.underline}.35 We might
even interpret the renewal of enthusiasm for Maoist theory (including
Alain Badiou's version) as part of the prevailing crisis of
ecological-political imagination.36 Minqi Li's is arguably the best
developed of this line of thought, and like Arrighi he locates the
fulcrum of global climate history in China, arguing that [Climate Mao
offers the only way forward]{.underline}: [\[U\]nless China takes
serious and meaningful actions to fulfill its obligation of emissions
reduction, there is little hope that global climate stabilization can be
achieved]{.underline}. [However, it is very unlikely that the
\[present\] Chinese government will voluntarily take the necessary
actions to reduce emissions]{.underline}. The sharp fall of economic
growth that would be required is something that the Chinese government
will not accept and cannot afford politically. Does this mean that
humanity is doomed? That depends on the political struggle within China
and in the world as a whole.37 [Taking inspiration from
Mao]{.underline}, Li says a new revolution in the Chinese revolution---a
re-energization of the Maoist political tradition---[could
transform]{.underline} China [and **save humanity from
doom**]{.underline}. He does not claim this is likely; one need only
consider China's massive highway expansions, accelerated automobile
consumption, and subsidized urban sprawl.38 But he is right that if an
anticapitalist, planetary sovereign is to emerge that could change the
world's climate trajectory, it is most likely to emerge in China.

#### Autocracies are better suited to enact meaningful climate action

**Gardels 18'** (Nathan Gardels, editor in chief of The WorldPost,
Democracy may fatally slow climate action, The World Post, September
13th, 2018,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/09/13/saving-the-planet/,
ME)

In his recent book, "How Democracy Ends," the Cambridge scholar [David
Runciman doubts that democracies can effectively battle oncoming
challenges]{.underline} that have not yet fully arrived. "Climate
change," he writes, ["lacks political grip on our imaginations because
it is so incremental. The environmental apocalypse is only ever a
creeping catastrophe]{.underline}. We experience it as a rumor."In other
words, the future, by definition, has no present political constituency
in systems legitimated by consent of the governed. In this sense,
[democratic politics can disable the requisite will to act until climate
calamity is already upon us.]{.underline} That will likely be too late.
Ominous signs, such as intense storms like Hurricane Florence or this
season's wildfires, from California to the forests above the Arctic
Circle in Sweden, are hopefully bringing forward a concrete awareness of
what the future holds. Yet, as Barack Obama reminded Americans last week
--- referring to [President Trump's rollback on a wide range of
policies, including on the environment --- progress does not advance in
a straight line.]{.underline} [Two steps forward often entail one step
back, the former president lamented. This is particularly true in
democracies where partisan fever is so high that a new election can
result in totally overturning a course of action that the public
embraced only a few years earlier But there is no time to
waste]{.underline}. As the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate
recently reported, we [are facing "a unique 'use it or lose it'
moment."]{.underline} If the world cannot reach the goal of the Paris
climate accord to keep the global average temperature below 2 degrees
Celsius in the next decade, the planet will heat up past the point of no
return. In short, when it comes to climate change, time is an ethical
dimension. Whether our species can regain the time lost during this "one
step back" is the open question upon which our ability to radically
adapt, or even survive, depends. In this respect, China's one-party,
long-term-oriented system presents yet another challenge to the West.
Indeed, California Governor Jerry Brown warned this week that by
sabotaging America's electric car industry, Trump was handing the future
of auto manufacturing to the modernizing Middle Kingdom, which is
vigorously pursuing new battery technologies. **[China's leaders believe
in science. They have the will and capacity to take decisive and
meaningful climate action on a large scale, without a break in the
continuity of governance.]{.underline}** Whether democracies can
similarly rise to this challenge without resorting to authoritarian
means will determine if, one dire day, the choice comes down to liberty
or survival. In The WorldPost this week, we publish varying perspectives
on this challenge in tandem with the Global Climate Action Summit taking
place in San Francisco, co-chaired by Governor Brown, former New York
Mayor Michael Bloomberg and China's top climate negotiator, Xie Zhenhua.
Christiana Figueres, who presided over the successful negotiations that
led to the Paris climate accord, focuses on particulate pollutants in
the air that are the consequence of our civilization's carbon exhaust.
"[Global warming is not just manifesting in devastating fires, floods
and heatwaves; its causes are impacting nearly every breath we take,"
she writes. "Thick, heavy smog caused by the burning of fossil fuels and
crops is choking cities around the world. China has been forced to close
tens of thousands of factories to reduce its air pollution.]{.underline}
Air pollution in Africa has been ruled responsible for more deaths than
unsanitary water or malnutrition. Last November, Arvind Kejriwal, chief
minister of India's capital city, wrote: 'Delhi has become a gas
chamber.\' Figueres, however, is optimistic that we are on the cusp of a
shift. "Driven in part by the demand for and the undeniable benefits of
clean, breathable air, the paradigm in which development and economic
growth depend on coal in particular is rapidly being replaced," she
writes. "The truth is that addressing global warming and its causes is
now the only real way to secure economic growth. That means powering it
with clean, everlasting, abundant alternatives. Governments everywhere
can reap enormous benefits, including saving billions of dollars on
healthcare, by fostering a shift to electric transport, eliminating
fossil fuel subsidies and scaling ecosystem restoration including
mangroves, peat bogs and forests." Erik Hoffner agrees on this last
point. While carbon sequestration technologies are promising, he says,
they are likely prohibitively expensive. The same result can be
accomplished by the low-tech and far less capital-intensive alternative
of agroforestry, which is "essentially a forest-mimicking agriculture
that involves growing trees, shrubs and vegetables in tight
assemblages." James Redford and Adam Browning argue that what unites
Americans on climate action is, ultimately, the jobs and an improved
economy that clean energy can bring. In a short video, they report from
their road trip through Minnesota on local communities that are building
a solar-based energy grid in this northern state not known for its
sunshine. Ali Hasanbeigi and Daniel Moran ponder an entirely new aspect
in the climate change debate. While the Paris accord is based on
measuring domestic emissions within a country's borders, it does not
count "emissions associated with the products countries import --- which
can often constitute significant shares of a nation's economic
activity." As a result, "more than 25 percent of global greenhouse gas
emissions are embodied in trade and flow through this glaring 'carbon
loophole,' one of the most critical and under-discussed problems in
international climate policy circles." To close the carbon loophole, the
authors call on nations and companies to "buy clean" by establishing
"rules that favor the purchase of cleaner, low-carbon products and that
drive clean innovation through the power of the purse." One of the
essential elements in fighting climate change is putting a worldwide
price on carbon. To move toward this goal, I propose in my profile of
Jerry Brown that he take on the role of a global elder statesman on the
issue when he leaves office next year. He has not only made his state a
leader in battling global warming; he has also strung together a global
"network of the willing" to implement the Paris accord despite America's
official withdrawal. First and foremost among his tasks would be to
integrate California's sizable carbon trading market created by its
"cap-and-trade" programs with similar markets in China and Europe. "The
model for Brown's elder statesman role," I write, "is Jean Monnet, a
former French official and diplomat who devised the idea of the European
Coal and Steel Community implemented in the 1950s. The driving notion
was that regional integration of heavy industry in the Ruhr Valley along
the French-German border in the years following World War II would
accelerate economic reconstruction and make war 'not only unthinkable
but materially impossible.'"Similarly, I argue, "the integration of
cap-and-trade markets today would not only ultimately establish a global
carbon price that would diminish reliance on fossil fuels; it would also
create a bridge of common intent across boundaries to save the planet
despite national conflicts arising today in trade and security matters.
Tying our climate fates together would in effect serve as a kind of
preemptive version of the Coal and Steel Community."

#### Even if democratic institutions [could]{.underline} generate pro-climate policy making -- rampant corruption precludes compliance 

**Povitkina 18'**(Marina Povitkina, Postdoctoral researcher at the
Department of Political Science at the University of Oslo and Center for
Collective Action Research at the University of Gothenburg, The Limits
of Democracy in tackling climate change, March 2018,
<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323530041_The_limits_of_democracy_in_tackling_climate_change>,
ME)

National-level carbon dioxide emissions depend on a multitude of
factors, including countries' economies, geography, demographics, and,
not least, politics. The aim of this study has been to focus
specifically on the political 424 M. POVITKINA determinants of CO2
emissions and revisit the findings reported in previous literature
indicating that the amount of countries' CO2 emissions is associated
with their level of democracy. Here, I instead argue that while
[democratic institutions shape preference aggregation within a polity
and favor environmental commitments, **the benefits of democracy for
climate change mitigation are limited in the presence of corrupt
institutions, which obstruct coercive capacity, extractive capacity of
the state, actors' compliance, and pro-climate
policy-making.**]{.underline} To test this claim, I investigate whether
the association between democracy and CO2 emissions is conditional on
the levels of corruption. In pursuing this aim, I analyze the emitting
behavior of countries across the globe over time and estimate a
within-between regression, which takes into account the variation
between countries and simultaneously accounts for the developments in
countries over time. Such investigation brings a number of insights into
the political factors behind the differences in CO2 emissions between
countries and the political drivers of emission reduction within states.
The results of this study show that after taking into account the common
economic, geographical, and demographic explanations of CO2 emissions,
political factors still make a difference. In accordance with most
previous results, my findings show that more democratic countries do
tend to emit less. However, this is only true for those democracies
where corruption is low. [When corruption is high, democracy does not
seem to make a difference for the level of emissions]{.underline}**,**
[all else equal. It does not matter for the level of emissions whether a
country has free elections, freedom of the press, and freedom of
association if the executive, judicial and legislative branches of the
state do not function well and are drenched in corruption and
clientelism]{.underline}. [In such a case, democracies do not seem to do
any better than authoritarian regimes, where decision-making power is in
the hands of a narrow elite. To exemplify, the results imply that it
makes no difference for the national levels of CO2 emissions if a
country is a democratic and corrupt Jamaica or an authoritarian and
corrupt Azerbaijan.]{.underline} The results also show that a political
system with a low level of corruption is not a universal
cure[.]{.underline} Lower corruption seems to matter only for the levels
of CO2 emissions in democratic regimes and the level of corruption does
not seem to play a role if a country is authoritarian. For example,
being democratic and relatively non-corrupt Austria is more beneficial
for lower CO2 emissions than being democratic but moderately corrupt
Slovakia. However, at the same time, being an authoritarian regime with
relatively low-corrupt institutions, such as Saudi Arabia, does not seem
to be associated with lower emissions than being an authoritarian and
corrupt regime, such as Yemen. While we can only gain insights about the
associational relationship between democracy, corruption, and CO2
emissions from the between country estimates, the analysis of changes
over time brings us closer to causal claims. The results from the
within-part of the analysis show a similar picture to the between-part:
positive changes in democracy are associated with the reduction in
emission levels only when countries experience relatively low levels of
corruption. When corruption levels in countries are low relative to what
these countries experienced on average over the time period under
investigation, steps toward democracy go together with steps toward
climate change mitigation. When corruption is relatively high, more
democracy does not seem to make a difference for emission control.

[Is Democracy Good or Bad for Health in a Pandemic? In general, social
scientists have tended to agree]{.underline}, albeit with caveats, [that
democracy is beneficial for public health]{.underline}. [COVID-19 is
raising important questions about this contention as high-profile cases
show authoritarian countries winning praise for their response while
leading **democracies have struggled to respond**.]{.underline} This
complicates, perhaps in helpful ways, the exploration of health and of
democracy. A wide literature has long debated the value of democracy for
health. [Electoral pressures and political freedoms of democratic
regimes, it is argued, contribute to improved health and longer
lives]{.underline} (Ruger 2005; Sen 1999). These claims have empirical
support in political science (Gerring, Thacker, and Alfaro 2012; McGuire
2010; Przeworski et al. 2000; Wigley and Akkoyunlu-Wigley 2017),
economics (Kudamatsu 2012), and public health (Bollyky et al.
2019)---though not without challenge, as some have shown weak or no
connection (Ross 2006). A range of mechanisms have been proposed and
tested for how democracy improves health including incentives---median
voters desire redistribution, and a norm of equality increases support
for accessible health services; information---open media and opposition
ensure that information both flows to the public about health and from
the public to government about how to calibrate policy;
accountability---enabling voters can punish leaders who fail; and
association---enabling knowledge networks and interest groups to drive
good policy. [The narrative of Chinese success and U.S. failure has led
to concern that COVID-19 represents bad news about the value, and
future, of democratic governance]{.underline} (Diamond 2020). [Initial
studies have already been conducted showing **a correlation between
democracy and worse outbreaks** as well as **less effective policy
responses**]{.underline} (Cepaluni, Dorsch, and Branyiczki 2020).
[Pandemic response is different from much of population health---with
effective responses requiring the ability to act quickly, implement
effectively, and gain public compliance]{.underline}. With the exception
of HIV (e.g., Lieberman 2009), disease outbreaks and political
institutions have been under-studied in comparative politics---with much
of the literature focused on infant mortality or life expectancy,
long-running trends that have far different mechanisms from a pandemic.
[Here, the **accountability mechanisms that help democracies perform
better may not be as beneficial.**]{.underline} [Political leaders with
short time horizons may have relatively **weak incentives to invest in
pandemic preparedness and response**]{.underline} (Dionne 2010; Healy
and Malhotra 2009). [And some of the benefits of associational networks
and civil society can be shut down in the face of an emergency---facing,
for example, stay-at-home orders]{.underline}. [Democracies also have
the added challenge of managing competing political factions and
institutions, some of whom may have **political incentives to undermine
response**]{.underline}. [Once the outbreak broke into the public and
Beijing was moved to act, China was able to quickly shut down the Wuhan
market, shut down the movement of tens of millions of people, screen and
isolate the sick, and even build two hospitals in a matter of
days.]{.underline} [Singapore is another autocracy that has gained
praise for its quick response. **The U.S.**, on the other hand, **has
struggled to respond**]{.underline}. [The Trump administration focused
on travel bans to keep the "foreign" virus out rather than on mobilizing
public health capacities to detect and respond---a message that aligns
with the Trump administration's election-year antiimmigrant and
anti-China political frame.]{.underline} The President's incentive
structure has been clear, as his administration has tried to label
COVID-19 the "Wuhan Virus," continuing a trade war with China, the
largest producer of medical goods needed by the U.S. Perhaps these
incentives were clearest in early March when Trump resisted allowing a
cruise ship with COVID-19 cases to dock because "I don't need to have
the numbers double because of one ship" (The White House 2020).

The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which is causing [COVID-19]{.underline}
disease, has [taught us unexpected lessons about the dangers of human
suffering through highly contagious and lethal diseases]{.underline}. As
the COVID-19 pandemic is now being partially controlled by various
isolation measures, therapeutics, and vaccines, [it became clear that
our current lifestyle and societal functions may not be sustainable in
the long term]{.underline}. We now have to start thinking and planning
on how to face the next dangerous pandemic, not just overcoming the one
that is upon us now. **[Is there any evidence that even worse pandemics
could strike us in the near future and threaten the existence of the
human race? The answer is unequivocally yes.]{.underline}** It is not
necessary to get infected by viruses found in bats, pangolins, and other
exotic animals that live in remote forests to be in danger. [Creditable
scientific evidence indicates that the human gut microbiota harbor
billions of viruses that are capable of affecting the function of vital
human organs]{.underline} such as the immune system, lung, brain, liver,
kidney, or heart. [It is]{.underline} remotely [possible
that]{.underline} the development of [pathogenic variants in the gut can
lead to contagious viruses, which can cause pandemics]{.underline},
leading to the destruction of vital organs, causing death or various
debilitating diseases such as blindness, respiratory, liver, heart, and
kidney failures. [These diseases could result in the complete shutdown
of our civilization and probably the]{.underline} gradual **[extinction
of the human race.]{.underline}** This essay will comment on a few
independent pieces of scientific facts, and then combine this
information to come up with some (but certainly not all) hypothetical
scenarios that could cause human race misery, even extinction, in the
hope that these hypothetical scenarios will trigger preventative
measures that could reverse or delay the projected adverse outcomes.
1. Introduction Le Chatelier's Principle: Named after the French
chemist, Le Chatelier's principle posits that "When an external stress
(change in pressure, temperature or concentration) is applied to a
system in chemical equilibrium, the equilibrium will change in such a
way as to reduce the effect of the stress." In other words, a change in
a system will evoke a counter-change, which will bring the equilibrium
to a new point. This principle operates with almost every human or other
activity. For example, it is known that when fruit production in the
Serengeti ecosystem is reduced, the number of elephants, which feed on
these fruits, is reduced proportionally. In the context of this essay, I
hypothesize that [human-made changes in climate, the atmosphere, water,
soil, and all other planet-living organisms, will likely evoke
counter-changes that may be highly consequential to human
life]{.underline}. [Due to the complexity of our ecosystem, humans do
not know exactly how these changes will affect them in the
end]{.underline}. Consequently, they choose to disregard them because
lifestyle adjustments may cost money and convenience or loss of
well-established pleasures. 1.1. The earth is changing rapidly What is
changing on the earth that could induce a potentially catastrophic
counter-change? The answer is everything is changing , from the living
inhabitants (humans, other species, and plants) to the atmosphere,
water, soil, climate, among else. The [changes caused by human activity
are]{.underline} sometimes [dramatic]{.underline}. For example, it has
been estimated that about 1 million out of 8.5 million species of
plants, animals, and other organisms are in imminent danger of
extinction \[1\]. Other estimates show that 50% of the organisms that
existed 50 years ago have already gone extinct, not to consider
additional species that are gone before we even identify them. [Soon, we
will likely be losing more than 80% of the world's species due to human
overdevelopment and its associated consequences]{.underline}. The major
reasons for species extinction are habitat destruction, pesticide
poisoning, and illegal hunting \[1\]. 2. Global warming Some may choose
to believe what the politicians are debating about: that [climate
change]{.underline} is a fact or fiction, but the data say that the last
6 years were the warmest on record \[2\]. Overall, the planet was 1.25°C
warmer than in preindustrial times (in the 1950s). Warmer oceans are
melting ice sheets and rising sea levels by almost 5 mm per year. In
Australia, record-setting heat and drought were responsible for the
bushfires that destroyed almost 25% of southeastern Australia's forests
and their living inhabitants, such as koalas. If we cannot slow down
earth's heating by reducing emissions, the current increase of about
0.2°C per decade will likely be rapidly surpassed. How will the planet
react? Likely with more catastrophic fires, tsunamis, earthquakes, and
floods. The human homeostatic changes to increased temperatures are very
complex and include many vital organs \[3\]. Global warming
[may]{.underline} also cause [changes in the biology of our candidate
foes, the viruses, bacteria, and parasites that live in our gut and
skin]{.underline} (see Section 2.2). 2.1. How much human-made
environmental damage has been done already? Humans are now the
undisputed masters of the planet and cannot be easily stopped from
actively destroying it, consciously or unconsciously. An interesting
question is how much damage has been claimed to be done already, and do
we have the data to support these claims? Elhacham et al. have recently
compared the natural biomass that exists on the earth with the
human-made (anthropogenic) mass \[4\]. They found that each person on
the globe produces a mass that is about equal to their body weight every
week! Is that too little or too much? Let us first define biomass and
anthropogenic mass. The majority of the earth's biomass is represented
by trees and bushes. The majority of the man-made mass is represented by
buildings and infrastructure such as roads and consists of concrete,
bricks, asphalt, metals, and plastic. Just consider that the total
global mass of produced plastic so far is greater than the overall mass
of all terrestrial and marine animals combined! So, how do we fare when
comparing biomass to anthropogenic mass production? In the 1900s, the
latter represented only 3% of global biomass; but now, in the 2020s, the
two masses are about equal. The projection is that if we go on with more
deforestation, buildings, streets, plastics, cars, and so on, by 2040,
it is likely that anthropogenic mass will almost triple the earth's
biomass. Will there be enough resources and clean air and water to
sustain the life of the projected 9 billion inhabitants? Anthropogenic
mass production is difficult to slow down since this activity is
considered part of our evolving civilization and way of living. 2.2.
Human microbiome The human body consists of approximately 30 trillion
cells, but the microbiota population in the human gut is estimated to be
300 trillion \[5\]! In addition, there is another microbiota in the skin
and other organs. It was initially thought that these microbiota act
locally (e.g., only in the gut or skin), but new evidence suggest that
the effects of microbiota may be global, reaching every cell in the
body. This can be achieved with various mechanisms, one being the
transmission of signals mediated by proteins that can travel through
anatomically distinct structures such as the vagus nerve. For example, a
protein called curli can travel through the vagus nerve and reach the
brain, where it can promote abnormal aggregation of proteins such as
a-synuclein, one major pathogenetic player in Parkinson's disease
\[5,6\]. Another and even more likely mechanism includes the diffusion
of bacterial or viral proteins (some could be toxins to various organs)
or pathogenic viruses into the bloodstream. From there, they can travel
around the body. This is reminiscent of cancer cell metastasis by the
hematogenous route. One piece of evidence for that happening is that
about half of the human metabolome (the collection of all metabolites in
the blood) is derived by host bacteria \[5\]. Bacteria or virus-derived
metabolites could also pass through the placenta and reach the fetus,
including the fetal brain, possibly causing diseases such as autism.
Despite skin not being as hospitable to microorganisms as the gut, a
typical person may have about 1,000 species of bacteria on their skin
\[7\]. These microbial communities continue to grow and diversify until
puberty when hormonal and developmental changes reach a plateau. The
balance between host and bacteria in the skin is determined by the
production of skin-derived microbial nutrients, microbiome-derived skin
nutrients, skin, and microbiome-derived antimicrobial peptides, and by
the interaction of the microbiome with the host's immune system. Similar
as in the gut, there is a delicate balance between beneficial and
potentially harmful bacteria and the host immune system. It is remotely
possible that our future enemies may derive from the gut, skin, or other
organs harboring microorganisms. In addition, the skin is more sensitive
to environmental changes such as climate change as it is directly
exposed to the environment. In conclusion, bacterial, viral, and
parasite-derived proteins or pathogenic viruses thrive locally (e.g., in
the gut or skin) but are capable of acting globally. 2.3. Human viruses
and how they could cause disease Many strains of gut bacteria are
harmless, but they can become dangerous pathogens under certain
conditions, such as antibiotic use \[8\]. It is well known that gut
bacteria can harbor many viruses (bacterial phages) \[9\]. If they do
not immediately kill the infected bacteria, these viruses incorporate
into the bacterial genome and stay latent for extended periods (they are
known "prophages"). These prophages can be reactivated under certain
environmental or other factors and act like pathogenic viruses. It is
rather surprising that, in general, [viruses are so many that they
qualify as the most abundant biological entities on the
planet.]{.underline} Sometimes, gut bacteria use their activated
prophages as weapons to gain an advantage and kill other competing
bacteria. Phages could also assist in bacterial evolution as the latter
become more virulent \[10\]. The gut bacteria also seem to interact with
the host immune system and can influence the efficacy of cancer
immunotherapy \[11,12,13\]. The microbiome has been blamed for playing
direct or indirect roles in many human diseases, including cancer,
metabolic syndrome, diabetes, dementia, and others \[14\]. The outcomes
regarding health and disease depend on the balance of powers among the
gut/skin/other organ viruses, the gut/skin/other organ microbiomes, and
the host immune system. If this balance is disturbed, a biological war
between these players will be initiated, and the outcome will be
unpredictable. In conclusion, scientific evidence supports the idea that
phages in the mammalian intestine, skin, or elsewhere, not only can be
engulfed by certain eukaryotic cells but also might escape from the gut
or skin, enter the bloodstream, and make their way into other parts of
the body, with as yet undiscovered consequences. 2.4. Viral variants
[Viruses evolve continuously, eventually leading to more transmissible
variants]{.underline}, which sometimes can be more lethal than the
original strains. The SARS-CoV-2 is an excellent contemporary example.
Multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 are rapidly spreading and are becoming
dominant in certain geographic areas \[15,16\]. For example, the B.1.1.7
variant (United Kingdom) has 23 mutations and 17 amino acid changes;
variant 501Y.V2 (South Africa) has 23 mutations and 17 amino acid
changes; and P.1 variant (Brazil) has approximately 35 mutations with 17
amino acid changes. In April 2021, when this document was first written,
I speculated verbatim that "new variants with additional mutations could
become able to evade our currently available vaccines by weakening the
ability of vaccine-induced antibodies to neutralize/block viral entry,
and by strengthening the ability of the virus to enter the cells via
surface receptors." The so-called "omicron variant," isolated in
November 2021, already fulfilled this prediction. 2.5. How COVID-19 and
possibly other viruses affect the brain In general, viral invasion of
the central nervous system may be achieved by several routes, including
transsynaptic transfer across infected neurons, entry via the olfactory
nerve, infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across
the blood--brain barrier. SARS-CoV-2 invades endothelial cells via
transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding
and a subsequent proteolytic event, facilitated by transmembrane
protease serine 2 \[17\]. Is there evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can enter
the brain? The answer is yes \[18\]. As already mentioned, one route is
by migrating from the cribriform plate along the olfactory tract \[19\]
or through vagal pathways. Another route may include viral entry into
brain capillary endothelial cells via the ACE2 pathway. Viral RNA was
detected in the medulla and cerebellum by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. However, viral proteins seem to
be absent from neurons and glial cells. Consequently, the adverse events
of the virus on the brain, including altered neurotransmission and
neuronal damage, are likely mediated by neuroinflammation and hypoxic
injury through cytokines and other proinflammatory mediators. 2.6.
SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other viruses can affect the senses Viruses can
affect our senses. For example, SARS-CoV-2 causes anosmia (loss of
smell) and ageusia (loss of taste) in 40--70% of COVID-19 patients
\[20\]. These effects persist, but it is unknown for how long. Other
neurological symptoms include headache, stroke, impairment of
consciousness, seizure, anxiety, and encephalopathy. Current evidence
suggests that SARS-CoV-2-related anosmia may be a new viral syndrome
specific to COVID-19. This syndrome is likely mediated by intranasal
inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into the olfactory neural circuitry. Since the
olfactory sensory neurons do not express ACE2 receptor, the likely
explanation for the loss of smell is the damage of accessory cells
supporting these neurons. Although anosmia is not a lethal or severe
disease, other neurological damage such as blindness could be
devastating \[21,22\]. 3. Adverse scenarios Fifty years ago, one adverse
scenario regarding a pandemic was presented in the film "The Andromeda
strain," which describes a pandemic caused by a pathogen of
extraterrestrial origin \[23\]. Here, I present an alternative
hypothetical scenario that involves an endogenous virus. Obviously,
there is a myriad of similar scenarios, and the one given below can be
currently classified as fictional but not impossible. A prophage, which
was residing dormant for years in the genome of the commensal gut
bacterium Bifidobacterium infantis suddenly, and without an apparent
reason, has undergone induction and started to produce viral proteins,
which were subsequently assembled into whole phages. After cell lysis,
these phages infected other neighboring cells. This cycle was repeated
many times, and millions of free virions were released, some entering
the systemic circulation (viremia). Some virions reached the lung
endothelium and entered the endothelial cells through an, as yet,
unknown receptor and started replicating and lysing these cells. The
resulting mucous caused the host to cough, thus facilitating the
transfer of the virus to other humans through aerosol droplets. Soon,
the virus was able to infect, first a few hundred, then thousands, then
millions of other unsuspected people through coughing and sneezing. The
virus was able to travel all over the world as the pulmonary
manifestations were mild, and most infected individuals thought it was a
common flu or a similar ailment. Scientists isolated the virus that
caused this flu-like disease and determined from its genomic sequence
that it was a novel member of influenza virus B, which usually causes
seasonal flu. Despite the pandemic nature of the infection, nobody died,
and governmental bodies were not highly concerned. Six months later, one
individual reported a weakening of his vision, which, within 3 months,
progressed to total blindness. This unusual form of blindness quickly
spread to other people until scientists performed epidemiological
studies, which linked the blindness to the previously mentioned mild
flu. Soon afterward, scientists isolated and identified the virus from
the brains of blind and subsequently succumbed individuals and confirmed
that the sequence matched the virus that caused the unusual flu. More
elaborate studies had shown that there was unusual and very severe
neuroinflammation around the occipital lobe of the brain (Brodmann area
17), an area responsible for the interpretation of visual signals
arriving from the optic nerve. Several therapeutics were tried, but none
was proven to be effective. Twelve months into the pandemic, 10 million
people lost their vision, and within 18 months, without any success in
developing therapies or a vaccine, the blindness had spread to whole
nations. 3.1. Blindness The selection of blindness as a chronic
consequence of an acute pandemic was deliberate. In 1995, Portuguese
author Jose Saramago published a fictional novel entitled "Blindness"
(ISBN: 9780151002511), which contributed to him winning the Nobel Prize
in literature in 1998. Blindness, as portrayed in the book, is a highly
detailed story of a mysterious mass epidemic that caused blindness of a
whole nation and the social breakdown that followed. The blindness
pandemic, in many respects, is reminiscent of the current COVID-19
pandemic. Blindness caused widespread panic, anarchy, and government
lockdowns. The life of the blind people was characterized by filthiness,
aggressive manners, disrespect of others, and a struggle to survive by
any possible means. The breakdown of society was near total. Law and
order, social services, government, schools could no longer function.
Families have been separated and could not find one another. People
squat in abandoned buildings and scrounge for food. Violence, disease,
and despair threaten to overwhelm human coping. One of Saramago's
quotes, describing life after blindness, is reproduced here "Perhaps
humanity will manage to live without eyes, but then it will cease to be
humanity, the result is obvious..." 3.2. Other ailments Acute pandemics
could cause many other chronic diseases that can threaten the
sustainability of our present society. Although COVID-19 causes loss of
smell and taste, these are considered nonlife-threatening ailments.
However, in the long run, the permanent absence of smell and taste will
mean the loss of innumerable current pleasures associated with the
consumption of food and drinks. Clearly, loss of hearing will not be
compatible with current societal functions or human achievements. Acute
viral diseases are also associated with innumerable organ-specific
diseases such as heart, kidney, and reproductive failures and
disturbance of other vital functions that can paralyze our current
society, economy, and culture. Even a minor weakening of our memory
(mild cognitive impairment) could result in chaotic situations that
authors of fiction, such as Saramago, attempt to describe in detail in
future books. 3.3. Epilog Humans have learned to take for granted what
they currently have and enjoy. Perhaps, we did not realize that [the
human race's spectacular advances are dependent on several potentially
volatile abilities (senses, brain function) and that even one
loss]{.underline}, or diminution [of such abilities]{.underline},
[could]{.underline} be detrimental, [caus]{.underline}ing [a collapse of
our civilization]{.underline}. The COVID-19 pandemic helped us realize
that **[we may be sitting on a time bomb]{.underline}**, which might
explode if we continue disturbing the current equilibrium between humans
and other planetary partners. In addition to viruses of a rather exotic
origin, such as SARS-CoV-2, [billions of]{.underline} other
[viruses]{.underline} and other infectious agents [in our gut, skin, and
elsewhere are waiting for the right time to attack us. The lessons
learned from COVID-19 should be a wake-up call]{.underline} for humans
to stop disturbing the equilibrium with actions that favor the
well-being of humans but put in danger the existence of other
inhabitants of planet earth. Human migration, also known as "travel,"
has facilitated the travel of our foes, along with us, in every
conceivable corner of the world.

6 Discussion and conclusions [Our analysis demonstrates that in the
early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, **more democratic countries
experienced deaths sooner and on a larger scale**]{.underline}. [For
advocates of democratic governance, these results are
unsettling.]{.underline} We have several lines of rationalizing the
findings, which we believe open up some crucial debates in political
science. There may be systematic under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths in
less democratic countries. In some cases, under-reporting could be a
political decision. In other cases, it may reflect a lack of state
capacity to perform the testing necessary to determine the real cause of
death (Economist, 2020).24 We have tried to deal with this through our
instrumental variable strategy and by including controls for
governmental transparency, testing rates and sub-sample analyses, but it
remains a concern. [Centralized decision-making may be advantageous when
it comes to responding to pandemics]{.underline} (Schwartz, 2012). Table
5 shows that [more democratic countries had imposed less stringent
restrictions during the first 100 days of the crisis]{.underline}. [With
fewer checks built into the policy-making process, **public health
policy responses can be made more quickly and perhaps more incisively in
autocratic governments**]{.underline}. [Especially for policies that
impinge on civil liberties and privacy, **autocratic governments have a
far freer hand in imposing restrictions on their
citizens.**]{.underline} [The trade-off between the capacity to protect
the public health and personal liberties is a central debate during, and
probably well after, the COVID-19 crisis]{.underline} (Harari, 2020).
[Autocratic governments may have had an extra advantage to the extent
that their citizens are more obedient to governmental decrees,
especially those that may disrupt the social and business lives of
citizens]{.underline}. Figure 3 demonstrates that [more stringent
policies decreased deaths in less democratic countries, but not
necessarily in fully democratic ones]{.underline}. [Whether it comes
from higher public support for government initiatives]{.underline}
(possibly, through the threat of force) [or from the government's
ability to stifle debate around their decrees in the media, **the
greater obedience of citizens in autocracies may have had a role in the
lower scale of deaths**]{.underline}. [Protests against social
distancing restrictions in democracies with different institutional
performances, such as Brazil and the United States, seem to reinforce
this point.]{.underline} Finally, this paper contributes to a
substantive topic that will have broad and lasting implications. It may
well be many years until we have a clear understanding how the COVID-19
crisis will impact our societies. As the pandemic started in East Asia,
the location of some of the best-managed autocracies, it may be that our
sample disproportionately includes the autocratic governments with high
state capacity. Therefore, it is an area for future research to see if
our results hold when autocracies with lower state capacity are
eventually included in the sample.

#### Authoritarian measures are [essential]{.underline} to combat the spread of disease

**Trofimov 20** -- (Yaroslav Trofimov, Chief Foreign-Affairs Consultant
at the Wall Street Journal, "Democracy, Dictatorship, Disease: The West
Takes Its Turn With Coronavirus," 3-8-2020, Wall Street Journal,
https://www.wsj.com/articles/democracy-dictatorship-disease-the-west-takes-its-turn-with-coronavirus-11583701472)

[Western democracies confronting the spread of the novel coronavirus are
facing a test with profound implications for their future: **Will they
fail where authoritarian China**, which is touting itself as an
alternative model for the world, **is succeeding**? Covid-19, the
respiratory illness caused by the virus, has already become the most
consequential public-health crisis in generations, forcing lockdowns of
entire regions, disrupting international travel and damaging the global
economy ---all of this just weeks since the disease has begun to spread
outside China.]{.underline} In December and early January, when the
epidemic first erupted in China\'s metropolis of Wuhan and the
surrounding Hubei province, official secrecy and the punishment of
whistleblowers contributed to the virus\'s proliferation. Since then,
however, [China has adopted draconian measures to control social
interactions---a lockdown that seems to have halted the epidemic there,
at least for now]{.underline}. China\'s National Health Commission
Sunday reported only 44 new Covid-19 cases, far fewer than the daily
toll in the new hot spots of Italy, South Korea, France ---and now the
United States. [The Communist Party of China, or CPC, is already
advertising this achievement as proof of the superiority of its model
that prioritizes government control over individual
freedoms.]{.underline} \"The advantages of the Chinese system have once
again been demonstrated,\" went one of many such commentaries in recent
days, by academic Dong Yuzhen in People\'s Daily, the CPC\'s official
mouthpiece. \"China\'s battle against the epidemic showed that the CPC,
as China\'s ruling party, is by far the political party with the
strongest governance capability in human history.\" Europe\'s experience
in tackling Covid-19 offers little encouragement so far, with
politicians acting too little and too late, and largely failing to stem
the tide. In the U.S., too, nearly 500 cases have already been
diagnosed, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University as of
Sunday afternoon, even as testing capacity lags far behind Europe or
South Korea. [Many epidemiologists and experts warn that **drastic
measures of the kind deployed by China** and imposed in large parts of
northern Italy on Sunday morning---measures that are so far opposed by
President Trump---**are** now **overdue.** \"There is a large perception
gap between confirmed cases and unknown infections of Covid-19. This
requires school closures, large event cancellations, and other
aggressive steps,\"]{.underline} Mr. Trump\'s former homeland-security
adviser Tom Bossert tweeted Saturday, pointing to Italy\'s crisis as an
example of how hesitation caused by fears of hurting the economy ends up
exacting an even higher economic loss, without preventing the disease
spread. [Back when the epidemic was mostly limited to China, many
Western politicians focused on the initial failings in Wuhan, asserting
that the free flow of information in democracies would give them a
natural advantage during a massive public-health crisis. What is
becoming evident now, however, is that such **knowledge doesn\'t
necessarily translate into meaningful action**. \"For a month, we
thought that Chinese political values were the cause of the problem, and
that our values would protect us from the virus,\"]{.underline} said
Bruno Maçães, Portugal\'s former minister of European affairs and a
scholar of China\'s global rise. \"It was an ideological approach. You
need to use technology and political power, not just trust that things
will be all right because we have the right values.\" Italy, the first
European nation where the coronavirus spread rapidly, reaching 7,375
cases and 366 deaths by Sunday, acted faster than others, barring direct
flights from China in early February and rolling out tens of thousands
of tests. On Feb. 21, it was the first to quarantine several towns where
the virus had taken root. Yet, Italy\'s leaders, too, have exhibited a
spectacular failure to grasp the scope of the crisis. On Feb. 27, Nicola
Zingaretti, leader of one of the two main parties in Italy\'s government
coalition and head of the Lazio region, which includes Rome, posted on
Instagram a photo of himself clinking glasses with other people in a
Milan pub. \"Let\'s not lose our habits, we can\'t shut down Milan and
Italy. Our economy is stronger than fear: Let\'s go out for an aperitif,
a coffee or a pizza,\" he urged. On Saturday, Mr. Zingaretti said he had
become infected with Covid-19. The next day, Prime Minister Giuseppe
Conte signed an unprecedented decree that placed Milan, Venice, Parma
and several other northern Italian provinces on lockdown, and banned
public gatherings, concerts, sports matches and nightclubs in the entire
country. Though the new rules are strict, it isn\'t clear to what extent
Italians will comply given lax enforcement: The penalty for disobeying
Mr. Conte\'s decree is a fine of 206 euros (\$234) or imprisonment of up
to three months, a trifle compared with the punishment exacted by China
for breaking the quarantine. The Latest on the Coronavirus \* Deaths
have been reported in Florida and Washington state, bringing the number
of U.S. fatalities to 19; the total number of infections is now 376 \*
Japan, Singapore and Malaysia all reported their highest single-day
increases in cases \* South Korea added 483 cases for a total of 6,797
and Italy added 620 new cases and 49 fatalities in the 24 hours
preceding its report Friday evening \"We have a very strong sense of
individual freedom, but all European citizens---and not just
Italians---should understand that we are facing a great danger, and that
it can be overcome only with responsible behavior by every single
citizen,\" said Roberto Burioni, professor of microbiology and virology
at the San Raffaele hospital in Milan. \"I have found an extremely grave
undervaluation of the risk. Until yesterday, people continued to crowd
the ski resorts, the sports events. The individual citizens
unfortunately have not realized how important their personal behavior is
in order to stop the virus.\" [As Italy shut down, in nearby
France---which has reached 1,126 diagnosed Covid-19 cases, the same
level as Italy just nine days earlier---several tens of thousands
flocked to the streets on Sunday to celebrate the International Women\'s
Day.]{.underline} In Germany, where cases have topped 1,000, authorities
Saturday allowed a major soccer match to take place near the center of
the country\'s main outbreak in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. And
in the U.S., public life goes on almost as normal, with few restrictions
on schools, sports events, concerts or other public gatherings. Mr.
Trump and his two main Democratic challengers---all men over 70, the
demographic with the highest mortality from Covid-19---continue to hold
mass campaign rallies across the country. [\"China\'s top-down approach
seems to have done a pretty good job in terms of mobilizing the
resources and capabilities needed to reign in the virus. You see the
contrast with how **Western countries**, including the U.S., **have
failed to take decisive action**]{.underline},\" said Yanzhong Huang,
senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in
New York. \"[Many of the **Chinese experience measures** probably
**won\'t be replicable in** this country, or actually **any democracy**.
But our policy makers will face some tough decisions.]{.underline}\"

#### China's A.I and technology advances aid in fight against COVID

**Hessey 2020**, (Hessey Elliot, "China and AI: what the world can learn
and what it should be wary of", July 1, 2020,
<https://theconversation.com/china-and-ai-what-the-world-can-learn-and-what-it-should-be-wary-of-140995>)

China announced in 2017 its ambition to become the world leader in
artificial intelligence (AI) by 2030. While the US still leads in
absolute terms, [China appears to be making more rapid progress than
either the US or the EU, and central and local government spending on AI
in China is estimated to be in the tens of billions of
dollars.]{.underline} The move has led -- at least in the West -- to
warnings of a global AI arms race and concerns about the growing reach
of China's authoritarian surveillance state. But treating China as a
"villain" in this way is both overly simplistic and potentially costly.
While there are undoubtedly aspects of the Chinese government's approach
to AI that are highly concerning and rightly should be condemned, it's
important that this does not cloud all analysis of China's AI
innovation. The world needs to engage seriously with China's AI
development and take a closer look at what's really going on. The story
is complex and it's important to highlight [where China is making
promising advances in useful AI applications and to challenge common
misconceptions, as well as to caution against problematic uses. Nesta
has explored the broad spectrum of AI activity in China -- the good, the
bad and the unexpected. **China's approach to AI development and
implementation is fast-paced and pragmatic, oriented towards finding
applications which can help solve real-world problems**. Rapid progress
is being made in the field of healthcare, for example, as China grapples
with providing easy access to affordable and high-quality services for
its ageing population]{.underline}. Applications include "AI doctor"
chatbots, which help to connect communities in remote areas with
experienced consultants via telemedicine; machine learning to speed up
pharmaceutical research; and the use of deep learning for medical image
processing, which can help with the early detection of cancer and other
diseases[. Chinese AI tools are being used in the fight against
COVID-19. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, medical AI applications have
surged as Chinese researchers and tech companies have rushed to try and
combat the virus by speeding up screening, diagnosis and new drug
development. AI tools used in Wuhan, China, to tackle COVID-19 -- by
helping accelerate CT scan diagnosis -- are now being used in Italy and
have been also offered to the NHS in the UK.]{.underline}

[China is on track to becoming the biggest 5G market in the
world.]{.underline} Earlier this month, China turned on its 5G mobile
networks ahead of schedule. It announced days later that it was rolling
out research and development for 6G networks --- even though 5G is still
at its infancy. China's 5G commercial services are available in 50
Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen,
according to state-backed media Xinhua. In comparison, 5G services in
the U.S. are offered only in certain cities. Wendy Liu, head of China
strategy for UBS told CNBC there was greater willingness in China than
elsewhere to back 5G and blockchain technologies. That's because they
are key to facilitating and managing commerce in the world's most
populous country, she said. "[Due to its own needs, (China) is going to
push in that direction and you see this willingness to back these
technologies more so than anywhere else," said Liu. Blockchain, a
technology that underpins cryptocurrency Bitcoin, is now being used by
various industries from finance to food. "Blockchain has the potential
to fundamentally change the way businesses conduct business," said Lucy
Gazmararian, senior manager at PwC Hong Kong]{.underline}. "So, a number
of areas of financial services are really able to improve significantly
because of blockchain infrastructure." China recently threw its weight
behind blockchain. President Xi Jinping reportedly urged China to "seize
the opportunity" offered by blockchain, and called on the country to
advance development in the field. Edith Yeung, a partner at
blockchain-focused venture capital fund Proof of Capital, said the
Chinese government has been researching and studying the possibility of
launching its own digital currency in recent years. China's virtual
currency may be rolled out within a year: Proof of Capital. She said
Beijing has also identified entities for a potential rollout. A virtual
yuan could become a reality "quite soon," Yeung said, adding that it
could even challenge the U.S. dollar's global dominance. From
self-driving cars to cancer detection, artificial intelligence (AI)
promises to improve and speed up every business in the world. AI can be
broadly defined as technology that replicates human intelligence and
behavior, in areas such as problem-solving, learning and reasoning. The
leadership in Beijing announced in 2017 that it wants to become the
world leader in artificial intelligence by 2030. "[China is absolutely
leading the world in AI,"]{.underline} according to Frank Hester,
founder of TPP, a UK-based healthtech company that has been doing
business in China since 2013. "I've seen a change over the past 5 years
(in China) ... it's almost the policy now to do business with
foreigners, which is great." [According to Alain Bénichou, CEO of IBM's
Greater China business, 14% of firms in China have embraced AI
technology. He said the rate of adoption in China is higher than the
global average, but there is room to grow.]{.underline}

### ! Disease 

#### Pandemics risk extinction

Yaneer **Bar-Yam 16**, Founding President of the New England Complex
Systems Institute, "Transition to extinction: Pandemics in a connected
world," NECSI (July 3, 2016),
http://necsi.edu/research/social/pandemics/transition

Watch as one of the more aggressive---brighter red --- strains rapidly
expands. After a time it goes extinct leaving a black region. Why does
it go extinct? The answer is that it spreads so rapidly that it kills
the hosts around it. Without new hosts to infect it then dies out
itself. [That the rapidly spreading pathogens die out has important
implications for evolutionary research]{.underline} which we have talked
about elsewhere \[1--7\]. In the research I want to discuss here, [what
we were interested in is the effect of adding long range
transportation]{.underline} \[8[\]. This includes natural means of
dispersal as well as unintentional dispersal by humans, like adding
airplane routes, which is being done by real world airlines]{.underline}
(Figure 2). [When we introduce long range transportation into the model,
the success of more aggressive strains changes. They can use the long
range transportation to find new hosts and **escape local
extinction**.]{.underline} Figure 3 shows that the more transportation
routes introduced into the model, the more higher aggressive pathogens
are able to survive and spread. As we add more long range
transportation, [there is a critical point at which pathogens become so
aggressive that the entire host population dies.]{.underline} The
pathogens die at the same time, but that is not exactly a consolation to
the hosts[. We call this the phase **transition to
extinction**]{.underline} (Figure 4). [With increasing levels of global
transportation, human **civilization may be approaching such a critical
threshold**]{.underline}. In the paper we wrote in 2006 about the
dangers of global transportation for pathogen evolution and pandemics
\[8\], we mentioned the risk from Ebola. Ebola is a horrendous disease
that was present only in isolated villages in Africa. It was far away
from the rest of the world only because of that isolation. Since Africa
was developing, it was only a matter of time before it reached
population centers and airports. While the model is about evolution, it
is really about which pathogens will be found in a system that is highly
connected, and Ebola can spread in a highly connected world. The
traditional approach to public health uses historical evidence analyzed
statistically to assess the potential impacts of a disease. As a result,
many were surprised by the spread of Ebola through West Africa in 2014.
As the connectivity of the world increases, past experience is not a
good guide to future events. [A key point about the phase transition to
extinction is its suddenness. Even a system that seems stable, can be
destabilized by a few more long-range connections, and connectivity is
continuing to increase. So how close are we to the tipping point? We
don't know but it would be good to find out before it
happens.]{.underline} While Ebola ravaged three countries in West
Africa, it only resulted in a handful of cases outside that region. One
possible reason is that many of the airlines that fly to west Africa
stopped or reduced flights during the epidemic \[9\]. In the absence of
a clear connection, public health authorities who downplayed the dangers
of the epidemic spreading to the West might seem to be vindicated. As
with the choice of airlines to stop flying to west Africa, our analysis
didn't take into consideration how people respond to epidemics. It does
tell us what the outcome will be [unless we respond fast enough and well
enough to stop the spread of future diseases]{.underline}, which may not
be the same as the ones we saw in the past. [As the world becomes more
connected, the dangers increase.]{.underline} Are people in western
countries safe because of higher quality health systems? Countries like
the U.S. have highly skewed networks of social interactions with some
very highly connected individuals that can be "superspreaders." The
chances of such an individual becoming infected may be low but events
like a mass outbreak pose a much greater risk if they do happen. [If a
sick food service worker in an airport infects 100 passengers, or a
contagion event happens in mass transportation, an outbreak could **very
well prove unstoppable**]{.underline}.

## DRONES

### 1nc -- Drones 

#### Democracy causes drone warfare.

But a worry lingers in the back of our minds: perhaps, far from causing
a disconnect, instead [[there might be a **necessary connection**
between modern democracies and drone warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Most Americans hold that modern liberal democracies are worth defending.
They are worth defending because these democracies, more than any other
form of government, provide space for their individual citizens to
pursue their own interests. Every citizen has the right to his or her
own property, own form of worship, and own freedom of speech. And we
recognize the intrinsic value of every individual in our democratic
community. Such is the perk of being an American citizen---liberty and
justice for all, each in our own particular way.

In this ideal democracy, the interests of the individual are continuous
with the interests of the nation as a whole. Every citizen also has the
right to vote for leaders who are elected to protect the liberal
democratic institutions that Americans, for good reason, hold so dear.
And protection is, unfortunately, often required. There are, after all,
countries and nonstate actors who have little respect for the joys of
Western liberalism and who aim to undermine it at every turn.

Protecting democracy has always been a tricky proposition. Leaders such
as President Obama find themselves in a double bind. On the one hand,
they must take defensive measures to guard the nation and its citizens\'
rights and interests from external threats. But on the other hand,
[[leaders must develop]{.mark} and then adopt defensive military
[strategies that]{.mark} **[minimize]{.mark}**]{.underline}, hopefully
even eliminate, the **[[costs]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that their
citizens must face]{.underline}; [[it is impermissible to
send]{.underline}]{.mark} \[[[people]{.underline}]{.mark}\] men and
women off [[to die in wars]{.mark} that could be won without these
citizens\' direct and dangerous involvement]{.underline}. Every citizen,
even soldiers, has intrinsic value.

And so [[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark} and his predecessors [[ushered
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the era [**[drone warfare]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
a slew of other **[automated tech]{.mark}nologies**]{.underline}
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} would both protect citizens and [[shield
citizen-soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[Drone]{.mark}
[warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}**---[and]{.underline} its [collateral
damage]{.underline}---[[is]{.mark} a **[necessary
consequent]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} a certain
type of modern [[liberal democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}. If we are good
liberal democrats, the development of drone warfare should neither
surprise nor disturb us. [[Drones are **democratic
weapons**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[There are **no other
options**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

But drones do disturb us. The gruesome scenes of drone strikes---at
funerals and birthdays and reunions half a world away---disturb us. When
we have the rare misfortune of seeing these scenes, they keep us up at
night.

So why?

Our intuition about the shortcomings and moral failings of drone strikes
is not just a discomfort with robot warfare or carnage, but ought to be
a sign that we are uncomfortable with a particular form of [[liberal
democracy]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[necessitates drone
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The [inherent advantages]{.underline} of drones [will not
alone]{.underline} [make]{.underline} traditional [interstate warfare
more likely]{.underline}---such conflicts are relatively rare anyway,
with only one active interstate conflict in both 2012 and 2013.20 Nor
will the probable type, quantity, range, and lethality of armed drones
that states possess in coming decades make a government more likely to
attempt to defeat an opposing army, capture or control foreign
territory, or remove a foreign leader from power. However,
[**[misperceptions]{.mark}** over the use of armed drones
**[increase]{.mark} the likelihood** of **militarized
[disputes]{.mark}** with U.S. allies]{.underline}, [as well as U.S.
military forces]{.underline}, [which could [lead to]{.mark} an
**[escalating crisis]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[deeper U.S.
involvement]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Though surveillance drones can be
used to provide **greater stability**]{.underline} [between countries by
monitoring ceasefires or disputed borders]{.underline}, [[armed
drones]{.mark} will [have]{.mark} **[destabilizing
consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Arming a drone, whether by design
or by simply putting a crude payload on an unarmed drone, makes it a
weapon, and thereby a direct national security threat for any state
whose border it breaches. Increased Frequency of Interstate and
Intrastate Force For the United States, drones have significantly
reduced the political, diplomatic, and military risks and costs
associated with the use of military force, which has led to a vast
expansion of lethal operations that would not have been attempted with
other weapons platforms. Aside from airstrikes in traditional conflicts
such as Libya, Iraq, and Afghanistan---where one-quarter of all
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) airstrikes in 2012 were
conducted by drones---the United States has conducted hundreds in
non-battlefield settings: Pakistan (approximately 369), Yemen
(approximately 87), Somalia (an estimated 16), and the Philippines (at
least 1, in 2006).21 Of the estimated 473 non-battlefield targeted
killings undertaken by the United States since November 2002,
approximately 98 percent were carried out by drones. Moreover, despite
maintaining a "strong preference" for capturing over killing suspected
terrorists since September 2011, there have been only 3 known capture
attempts, compared with 194 drone strikes that have killed an estimated
1,014 people, 86 of whom were civilians.22 Senior U.S. civilian and
military officials, whose careers span the pre-- and post--armed drone
era, overwhelmingly agree that the [[threshold for]{.mark} the
[authorization]{.mark} of force by civilian officials [has been
**significantly reduced**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Former secretary of
defense Robert Gates asserted in October 2013, for example, that armed
drones allow decision-makers to see war as a "bloodless, painless, and
odorless" affair, with technology detaching leaders from the "inevitably
tragic, inefficient, and uncertain" consequences of war.23 President
Barack Obama admitted in May 2013 that the United States has come to see
armed drones "as a cure-all for terrorism," because they are low risk
and instrumental in "shielding the government" from criticisms "that a
troop deployment invites."24 Such admissions from leaders of a
democratic country with a system of checks and balances point to the
temptations that leaders with fewer institutional checks will face.
President Obama and his senior aides have stated that the United States
is setting precedents with drones that other states may emulate.25 If
U.S. experience and Obama's cautionary words are any guide, states that
acquire armed drones will be more willing to threaten or use force in
ways they might not otherwise, within both interstate and intrastate
contexts. [States might undertake cross-border]{.underline}, [interstate
actions less discriminately]{.underline}, [especially in areas prone to
tension]{.underline}. [As is apparent [in the **East** and **South China
Seas**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[nationalist sentiments
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [discovery of untapped]{.underline},
valuable national [[resources]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[make
disputes]{.mark} between countries **[more
likely]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In such contested areas, [drones will
enable governments to undertake strike missions or probe the responses
of an adversary]{.underline}---actions they would be less inclined to
take with manned platforms. According to the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA), there are approximately 430 bilateral maritime boundaries, most
of which are not defined by formal agreements between the affected
states.26 Beyond the cases of East Asia, [other cross-border
**[flashpoints for conflict]{.mark}** where the low-risk proposition of
drone strikes would be tempting [include]{.mark} **[Russia]{.mark}** [in
Georgia or Ukraine]{.mark}, **[Turkey]{.mark}** [in Syria]{.mark},
**[Sudan]{.mark}** within its borders, [and]{.mark} **[China]{.mark}**
on its western periphery]{.underline}. In 2013, a Chinese
counternarcotics official revealed that his bureau had considered
attempting to kill a drug kingpin named Naw Kham, who was hiding in a
remote region in northeastern Myanmar, by using a drone carrying twenty
kilograms of dynamite. "The plan was rejected, because the order was to
catch him alive," the official recalled.27 With armed drones, China
might make the same calculation that the United States has made---that
killing is more straightforward than capturing---in choosing to target
ostensibly high-threat individuals with drone strikes. China's
demonstrated willingness to employ armed drones against terrorists or
criminals outside its borders could directly threaten U.S. allies in the
region, particularly if the criterion China uses to define a terrorist
does not align with that of the United States or its allies.
Domestically, governments may use armed drones to target their perceived
internal enemies. Most [[emerging drone powers]{.mark} have
[experienced]{.mark} recent **[domestic unrest]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Turkey]{.underline}, [Russia]{.underline}, [Pakistan]{.underline}, [and
China]{.underline} [all have separatist or significant [opposition
movements]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., Kurds, Chechens, the Taliban,
Tibetans, and Uighurs) [that presented political and military challenges
to their rule in recent history]{.underline}. These states already
designate individuals from these groups as "terrorists," and reserve the
right to use force against them. [States]{.underline} possessing the
lower risk---compared with other weapons platforms---[capability of
[armed drones could use]{.mark} them **more frequently**]{.underline}
[[in]{.mark} the service of **[domestic
pacification]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially against time-sensitive
targets that reside in mountainous, jungle, or other inhospitable
terrain. Compared with typical methods used by military and police
forces to counter insurgencies, criminals, or terrorists---such as
ground troops and manned aircraft--- unmanned drones provide
significantly greater real-time intelligence through their persistent
loiter time and responsiveness to striking an identified target.
Increased Risk of Misperception and Escalation Pushing limits in already
unstable regions is complicated by questions raised regarding rules of
engagement: how would states respond to an armed drone in what they
contend is their sovereign airspace, and how would opposing sides
respond to counter-drone tactics? Japanese defense officials claim that
shooting down Chinese drones in what Japan contends is its airspace is
more likely to occur than downing manned aircraft because drones are not
as responsive to radio or pilot warnings, thereby raising the
possibility of an escalatory response.28 Alternatively, Japan might
misidentify a Chinese manned fighter as an advanced drone and fire on
it, especially if the aircraft's radar signature is not sufficiently
distinctive or if combat drones routinely fly over the disputed area.
Thus, the [additional risks associated with drone strikes]{.underline},
[combined with]{.underline} the **[lack of clarity]{.underline}**
[on]{.underline} [how]{.underline} two [countries would
react]{.underline} to an attempted downing of a drone, [[create]{.mark}
the **potential for [miscalc]{.mark}ulation**]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[subsequent
[escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As U.S. Air Force commanders in
South Korea noted, [[a North Korean]{.mark} drone equipped [with
chemical agents]{.mark} [would]{.mark} not have to kill many or even any
people on the peninsula to terrorize the population and **[escalate
tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}29 [[This scenario
points]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the **[spiraling escalatory dynamic]{.mark}**
that could be repeated]{.underline}---[likely intensified in the context
of armed drones]{.underline}---[in]{.underline} other [tension-prone
areas]{.underline}, [such as the **Middle East**]{.underline}, **[South
Asia]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[Central]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[East Africa]{.underline}**, [where the mix of
low-risk and [ambiguous rules of engagement is a **recipe for
escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Not all of these contingencies
directly affect U.S. interests, but they would affect treaty allies
whose security the United States has an interest in maintaining.
Compared with other weapons platforms, current practice repeatedly
demonstrates that **[[drones make militarized disputes more likely due
to]{.mark} a [decreased threshold for]{.mark} the [use]{.mark} of force
and an increased risk of miscalculation]{.underline}**. Increased Risk
of Lethality The [[proliferation]{.mark} of armed drones [will
**increase the likelihood** of **destabilizing**]{.mark} or devastating
one-off, **high-consequence attacks**]{.underline}. In March 2013,
Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) observed of drones: "In some respects
it's a perfect assassination weapon. . . . Now we have a problem. There
are all these nations that want to buy these armed drones. I'm strongly
opposed to that."30 [The worst-case contingency]{.underline} for the use
of armed drones, albeit an unlikely circumstance, [would be to deliver
weapons of mass destruction]{.underline}. [[Drones
are]{.underline}]{.mark}, in many ways, the
**[[perfect]{.underline}]{.mark}** vehicle [[for delivering
**biological**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[chemical
agents]{.underline}**]{.mark}.31 [A [WMD attack]{.mark}, or even the
assassination of a political leader]{.underline}, another troubling
though unlikely circumstance, [[would]{.mark} [have **tremendous
consequences**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} [regional
and **[international stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Deterring such
drone-based attacks will depend on the ability of the United States and
other governments to accurately detect and attribute them. Technical
experts and intelligence analysts disagree about the extent to which
this will be possible, but the difficulties lie in the challenges of
detecting drones (they emit small radar, thermal, and electron
signatures, and can fly low), determining who controlled it (they can be
programmed to fly to a preset GPS coordinate), or assigning ownership to
a downed system (they can be composed of commercial, off-the-shelf
components).32 It is equally noteworthy that civilian officials or
military commanders have almost always used armed drones in ways beyond
their initially intended applications. Drones do not simply fulfill
existing mission requirements; they create new and unforeseen ones, and
will continue to do so in the future. Furthermore, U.S. officials would
be misguided to view future uses of armed drones solely through the
prism of how the United States has used them---for discrete military
operations in relatively benign air-defense environments. The [potential
for misperception is compounded by the fact that few governments seeking
or acquiring armed drones have **publicly articulated** any strategy for
how they will likely use them]{.underline}. Conversely, the
[uncertainty]{.underline} about how other countries will use drones
[provides the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [with an
opportunity to **shape drone doctrines**]{.underline}, [especially
for]{.underline} U.S. [allies interested in procuring drones from U.S.
manufacturers]{.underline}.

the Research Council Project Director Senior Researcher @ the Peace
Research Institute Frankfurt; "Killer drones: The 'silver bullet' of
democratic warfare?" Security Dialogue; 43(4); p. 363--380;

Today, it is commonly believed that [40 or more countries are developing
military unmanned systems]{.underline} (Singer, 2009: 241). Much of the
data behind such a claim is hearsay and quite tough to verify. However,
the most recent edition of Military Balance, published annually by the
International Institute for Strategic Studies, can serve as a guidepost
and a first handle on numbers. Here, [34 countries are listed as holding
either medium- or heavy-sized UAVs]{.underline} (IISS, 2011: 24--6).
[The list of UAV holders reveals a peculiarity]{.underline}:
**[two-thirds of these countries are democratic states]{.underline}**.
[While the 'drone hype' is commonly said to be driven mainly by the
United States and Israel]{.underline}, [it seems that **democracies in
general** have been the **first to jump** on the un~~man~~ned
bandwagon.]{.underline} Democracy indices -- such as Polity IV, on which
we draw here -- need to be taken with an appropriate grain of salt, yet
they can be helpful in systemizing and corroborating this first
impression. With Polity IV ranging from 10 (strongly democratic) to --10
(strongly autocratic), [24 of those 34 countries]{.underline} listed in
Military Balance turn out to have a polity score of 6 or higher -- in
other words, they [can **safely be called democratic**]{.underline}. So,
[why are democracies in the driving seat of this
development]{.underline}? Some might point to a fairly obvious answer:
**[because they can be]{.underline}**. [The financial and technological
resources required for pursuing drone warfare are **most readily
available**]{.underline} [to wealthy states]{.underline}, [the
**majority** of which are democracies]{.underline}. Adhering to the
'technological imperative' (for a concise summary, see Reppy, 1990:
102--3), so this theoretical argument goes, [they employ these superior
resources to build the best technology and arm their militaries with
it]{.underline}, simply **[because it is possible]{.underline}** for
them to do so. Yet, no country's defense budget, not even that of the
USA, is limitless. Consequently, political decisions about how to
allocate resources have to be made, all while maintaining the
technological edge. So, for instance, why did the US Army abandon its
'Comanche' advanced helicopter project in 2004, thereby swapping a fast
and stealthy hi-tech helicopter for what were then technologically
inferior, slow, and non-stealthy drones (Fulghum and Wall, 2004)? The
simplistic argument according to which technology is the sole driver,
while commonplace and not entirely implausible, obviously carries only
so far. [We are]{.underline} not the first scholars to raise the
question of why democracies are so intrigued by unmanned weapon systems
and particularly drones at the moment, but [a review of the burgeoning
literature on military use of unmanned systems shows that the issue has
hitherto only been **dealt with cursorily and in passing**]{.underline}.
There is currently no general, systematic, and theory-driven study
seeking to probe the peculiar nexus of democracy and the use of unmanned
systems.3

#### Democracies will increasingly rely on drone and cyber technologies to reap the political benefits from conflict and avert the costs

[Dictatorships and tyrannies may be casual about spilling their people's
blood, but not democracies.]{.underline} [When the people get to decide
whether to go to war, they rarely do so willingly]{.underline}. This was
why Immanuel Kant said the spread of democracy was the best guarantee of
world peace. As he wrote in 1795, "if the consent of the citizens is
required in order to decide that war should be declared nothing is more
natural than that they would be very cautious in commencing such a poor
game". When contemporary thinkers such as Michael Doyle have tested
Kant's intuition, they have had to add a significant caveat:
[democracies may not like fighting each other -- which is why war has
become unthinkable between EU and Nato countries -- **but they can be
very warlike** indeed towards tyrants and ethnic cleansers. Drones and
cyberwarfare, the latest revolution in military technology, **will force
us to revise** still further Kant's **connection between democracy,
peace and war**.]{.underline} [Virtual technologies **make it easier for
democracies to wage war** because they eliminate the risk of blood
sacrifice that once forced democratic peoples to be
prudent.]{.underline} Virtual war in Kosovo meant piloted F-18s and
precision air strikes. In Afghanistan, too, the Taliban was routed
initially with precision air strikes guided by forward air controllers.
Libya was the same story. [Now democracies do not even have to put their
pilots in harm's way. Cyberwar and drones offer Nato democracies
enticing prospects of cheap, risk-free warfare -- and not just
democracies. A new arms race is already under way.]{.underline} Before
succumbing to these technologies, leaders should remember how little
virtual war has actually accomplished. Kosovo is still a corrupt ethnic
tyranny; Libya will take years to put itself back together; and no one
can see a stable state in sight in Afghanistan. Virtual war turned out
to be the easy part. Democracies have little staying power for the hard
part. Looking at the options in Syria, drone attacks on regime tank
formations and a cybercampaign to immobilise Bashar al-Assad's command
and control would be the easy part. Creating a Syria free of sectarian
warfare and ethnic political domination would be very hard. [If war is
the continuation of politics by other means, the chief factor limiting
the use of these new weapons will be whether they help leaders to attain
their political ends]{.underline}. Where these ends seem unattainable or
futile, as in Syria, the weapons will remain unused. [The larger problem
is that these new weapons are bound to escape political, and therefore
democratic, control]{.underline}. Previous revolutions in military
affairs, such as the coming of nuclear weapons, strengthened the hand of
presidents and prime ministers. [Drones and cyberwar technologies are so
cheap that it will be impossible to keep them under the lock and key of
the sovereign. The age of the super-empowered, and therefore
super-dangerous, individual has arrived. In deciding how to control
drone and cybertechnologies, it is worth remembering that democracies
are resilient because they are free.]{.underline} Our cybersystems are
now under constant attack and it is in responding to these attacks that
they become more secure. States will have to allow the global community
of coders and engineers who built and maintain the internet the freedom
to keep the malware at bay and keep the system open for the rest of us.
The new technologies are so easy and cheap to produce that the best
international law and state action can hope for is to generate a limited
set of shared norms to prohibit their most harmful uses. Even with these
in place, [drones and malware will fight our wars for us and serve our
eternal human desire to inflict harm without consequences. They will be
the mercenaries of the 21st century.]{.underline} In thinking about what
can keep these technologies under control, we need to remember Kant's
original bet on human prudence. Kant's insight was that human beings who
can freely choose and reason know full well that if you inflict harm, it
will come back to hurt you. Everything must be paid for. If you hit Iran
with Stuxnet, you render your own nuclear systems vulnerable to the next
hacker, individual or state. If you perfect the killing of individuals
with drones, you had better confine your acts to bona fide enemies of
your state; otherwise you expose your population as a whole to the same
heaven-sent vengeance. These new technologies promise harm without
consequence. Kant tells us there is no such thing. In this shared human
understanding, even between adversaries, lies prudence, and in prudence
-- caution, care and restraint -- lies hope.

### ! Drones -- Escalates -- No Checks

#### Drones circumvent institutional checks\-\--takes out all of their democracy restrains arguments

**Potter, 16** - Assistant Professor in the Department of Politics at
the University of Virginia (Philip B.K. Potter, \"Four Trends That Could
Put the Democratic Peace at Risk,\" *Political Violence at a Glance*,
10-14-2016,

The point is **[that it's not democracy alone that
matters]{.underline}**. Rather it is the limits that these regimes can
put on their leaders to force them to be careful and selective when
doing things like making threats and starting fights. This also means
it's not a baked-in advantage that a democracy can take lightly -- even
well-meaning leaders in democracies have every incentive to figure out
how to slip these constraints. Limits yield long-term advantages, but in
the immediate term they tie leaders' hands, preventing them from
engaging with the international problems or opportunities that they feel
they should. There are four trends that indicate this process is well
under way and is putting the "democratic advantage" at risk.
**[Militaries are less closely tied to voters]{.underline}** Democratic
advantages in conflict are commonly traced to the nature of democratic
militaries and their relationship with political power. Going all the
way back to Kant, there has been the notion that societies with citizen
soldiers and the vote are not going to support unnecessary wars when
they are going to bear the costs. The problem is that Kant's vision
isn't what modern armies look like, and they're intentionally moving
away from the target rather than toward it. In the US, military service
is all-volunteer, and the recruits are increasingly drawn from
concentrated segments of society. This divorces the consequences of
fighting from the day-to-day experience of most voters. Increasingly,
[this is a limited force supplemented by private sector
contractors]{.underline}, [placing even more distance between the
individual with the gun and the democratic process]{.underline}. The
[emphases on covert operations]{.underline}, [Special
Forces]{.underline}, [and technological superiority further **water down
the link between society and soldiers**]{.underline}. This was, in fact,
part of the point of moving to an all-volunteer force and one of the
rationales for investments in stealth, information technology, and
precision guided munitions, e.g. the precision strike complex. [By
replacing bodies with dollars, planners have consistently sought to
increase the flexibility that the US has in its use of
force]{.underline}. In the immediate term, that goal makes sense -- it
allows policy makers to do what they believe needs to be done without
having to worry about a fickle public. But [over the long
term]{.underline}, [it has the potential to lead to **less
caution**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[selectivity when engaging in
conflicts]{.underline}**. **[Adversaries are proliferating and
changing]{.underline}** The [emergence of non-state actors as a primary
threat has further **loosened constraints**]{.underline} on leaders.
[The shift from the possibility of total war with]{.underline} the
[Soviet]{.underline} Union [to myriad smaller-scale challenges
**accelerated the transition**]{.underline} [from a mass military to an
elite]{.underline}, [highly specialized force more isolated from
society]{.underline}. Compounding the challenge, this type of adversary
and conflict leads to more significant informational advantages for
leaders, which make democratic constraints less binding. Citizens and
political opposition are always playing catch-up with the executive when
it comes to foreign policy information, but the challenge is harder when
the **[adversaries are less familiar]{.underline}**, the **[engagements
shorter]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} [the issues **more
complex**]{.underline}. [**Technology is reducing constraint** New
technologies are driving citizens and political opposition ever further
out of the loop]{.underline}. [The extraordinary rise of **unmanned
vehicles** in combat **reduces the risk of casualties and extends the
range for projecting force**]{.underline}. This has undeniable strategic
advantages, but **[there is less visibility and]{.underline}**,
accordingly, **[less accountability]{.underline}** associated with the
use of this technology. This means [leaders worry less about the ex-post
constraints and costs that typically come with casualties]{.underline}.
**[Institutions and practices increasingly favor the
president]{.underline}** The recent nuclear agreement with Iran was an
executive agreement rather than a treaty. This is the norm -- [most
international agreements are now unilateral actions of the
president]{.underline}. A polarized Congress is ever more cautious in
its exercise of what little foreign policy power it has; two years into
the campaign against Islamic State and Congress still hasn't weighed in
one way or the other. In the US this is an expansion of the widely
accepted argument that there are two presidencies -- a constrained one
in domestic politics and a relatively autonomous one abroad. What's
unappreciated is that [this growing presidential autonomy]{.underline}
(which may well be needed to run a Superpower) also **[decreases
constraint]{.underline}** [and with it the foreign policy "advantages"
we associate with democracy]{.underline}. While [these advantages
are]{.underline} real, they are also **[fragile]{.underline}**. [Key
institutional constraints]{.underline} -- such as a robust political
opposition and a knowledgeable citizenry -- [are susceptible to
seemingly **minor changes**]{.underline} [in institutions and/or
practices that loosen the limits of leaders' foreign policy
decisions]{.underline}. [As technologies advance]{.underline}, [threats
shift]{.underline}, [and institutional constraints wax and
wane]{.underline}, **[the foreign policy advantages embedded within
democratic systems may begin to erode]{.underline}**. The potential for
such a shift is a possibility that should not be taken lightly.

#### Drones [collapse]{.underline} democratic checks against war AND cause [foreign policy failures]{.underline}.

Drones Undermine Democracy?,\" *Brookings*,

[For the first 200 years of American democracy, engaging in combat and
bearing risk]{.underline} --- both **[personal]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[political]{.underline}** --- [went hand in
hand]{.underline}. [In the age of drones, **that is no longer the
case**]{.underline}. Today's unmanned systems are only the beginning.
The original Predator, which went into service in 1995, lacked even GPS
and was initially unarmed; newer models can take off and land on their
own, and carry smart sensors that can detect a disruption in the dirt a
mile below the plane and trace footprints back to an enemy hide-out.
There is not a single new manned combat aircraft under research and
development at any major Western aerospace company, and [the Air Force
is training more operators of unmanned aerial systems than fighter and
bomber pilots combined]{.underline}. In 2011, unmanned systems carried
out strikes from Afghanistan to Yemen. The most notable of these
continuing operations is the not-so-covert war in Pakistan, where the
United States has carried out more than 300 drone strikes since 2004.
Yet this operation has never been debated in Congress; more than seven
years after it began, [there has not even been a single vote for or
against it]{.underline}. This campaign is not carried out by the Air
Force; it is being conducted by the C.I.A. This shift affects everything
from the strategy that guides it to the individuals who oversee it
(civilian political appointees) and the lawyers who advise them
(civilians rather than military officers). It also affects how we and
our politicians view such operations. President Obama's decision to send
a small, brave Navy Seal team into Pakistan for 40 minutes was described
by one of his advisers as "the gutsiest call of any president in recent
history." Yet few even talk about the decision to carry out more than
300 drone strikes in the very same country. [I do not condemn these
strikes; I support most of them]{.underline}. What troubles me, though,
is how [a new technology is **short-circuiting** the decision-making
process for what used to be the **most important** choice a democracy
could make]{.underline}. [Something that would have previously been
viewed as a war is simply not being treated like a war.]{.underline}
[The change is not limited to covert action]{.underline}. Last spring,
[America launched airstrikes on Libya as part of a NATO operation to
prevent Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's government from massacring
civilians]{.underline}. In late March, the White House announced that
the American military was handing over combat operations to its European
partners and would thereafter play only a supporting role. The
distinction was crucial. The operation's goals quickly evolved from a
limited humanitarian intervention into an air war supporting local
insurgents' efforts at regime change. But it had limited public support
and no Congressional approval. [When the administration was asked to
explain]{.underline} why continuing military action would not be a
[violation of the War Powers Resolution]{.underline} --- a Vietnam-era
law that requires notifying Congress of military operations within 48
hours and getting its authorization after 60 days --- [the White House
argued]{.underline} that [American operations did **not**]{.underline}
"**[involve]{.underline}** the presence of U.S. **[ground
troops]{.underline}**, U.S. [casualties]{.underline} or a serious threat
thereof." [But they did involve]{.underline} something we used to think
of as war: **[blowing up stuff]{.underline}**, lots of it.

#### Drone proliferation is rapid and escalates without checks

[Proliferation and arms-race instability]{.underline} As early as 2007,
the US Department of Defense wrote in its Unmanned Systems Roadmap that
for processor technology 'the ultimate goal is to replace the operators
with a mechanical facsimile \[of\] equal or superior thinking speed,
memory capacity, and responses gained from training and experience'. The
document also stated that the 'primary technical challenges for weapon
release from unmanned systems include the ability to reliably target the
right objective'.17 The goal of weapon autonomy pervades all subsequent
road maps.18 Autonomous weapon-system functions have since been tested
on land, under water, on the sea and, most notably, in the air. In fact,
current trends with respect to unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs or
'combat drones') provide indicators for what to expect with regard to
AWS. Unlike today's high-profile UCAVs, such as the Reaper, which are
propeller driven, slow, carry comparably small payloads and have few to
no capabilities for operating in contested airspace, future systems will
be less dependent on human control, faster, stealthy and capable of
delivering bigger payloads. The X-47B, for instance, has demonstrated
autonomous take-off from and landing on an aircraft-carrier deck, as
well as autonomous aerial refuelling. This technology demonstrator was
developed by the US Navy's Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne
Surveillance and Strike programme (UCLASS). Similarly, the British
Taranis UCAV was described by the UK Ministry of Defence as 'fully
autonomous' and able to 'defend itself against manned and other unmanned
enemy aircraft' with 'almost no need for operator input'.19 However, the
ministry also stated that 'the operation of weapons systems will always
be under human control'.20 While AWS test beds such as Taranis and the
X-47B rely on familiar designs, in this case the airframes of a fast,
stealthy, next-generation drone with substantial payload capabilities,
future systems will display an autonomous swarming capability, and thus
AWS will also come in much smaller sizes. In October 2016, for instance,
the US Department of Defense demonstrated a swarm of 103 Perdix micro
drones capable of 'advanced swarm behaviors such as collective
decision-making, adaptive formation flying, and self-healing'.21 In the
future, such micro drones are to be 3D printed in large batches and
deployed from (manned) flying systems. This dispensing method has
already been successfully tested at Mach 0.6 speed by two F/A-18 Super
Hornets releasing a Perdix drone swarm. The US Navy's LOCUST programme
is also seeking to develop swarming, disposable unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs).22 [The overall goal for this new ecosystem of flying assets is
to replace not just the old generation of drones but also manned
aircraft, thus continuing the trend towards keeping human pilots out of
harm's way and providing superior unmanned air-to-ground and air-to-air
capabilities across the board]{.underline}.23 In air-to-air combat, the
big, fast autonomous drones currently envisioned will be able to fly
high-g manoeuvres no human pilot would be able to endure. [More
importantly, they would ensure much shorter reaction times.]{.underline}
On-board sensors combined with artificial 'intelligence' -- either
located onboard or distributed in the swarm and based on decision-making
algorithms endowed with the authority to initiate an attack without
awaiting human input -- [are to make these weapons autonomous and hence
provide a decisive edge over remotely controlled and human-piloted
adversary systems alike]{.underline}. While the development of AWS is
currently most advanced in the air and under water -- that is, in less
cluttered environments -- the example of autonomous (swarms of) UCAVs
demonstrates the generally valid proposition that for future unmanned
systems, operational speed will reign supreme, regardless of the domain.
In that sense, technological developments in AI and robotics, as well as
current expectations regarding future armed conflict (and the need for
speed), jointly point towards AWS. In fact, US deputy secretary of
defense Bob Work stated in March 2016 that even the final delegation of
lethal authority to autonomous systems will inexorably happen as a
result of this race for speed.24 According to Work, the United States
'will not delegate lethal authority for a machine to make a decision ...
The only time we'll delegate authority is in things that go faster than
human reaction time, like cyber or electronic warfare.' Yet, he conceded
that such self-restraint may be unsustainable if an authoritarian rival
acts differently. 'We might be going up against a competitor who is more
willing to delegate authority to machines than we are and, as that
competition unfolds, we'll have to make decisions on how we can best
compete', Work said. 'It's not something that we have fully figured out,
but we spend a lot of time thinking about it.'25 To further deepen our
understanding of AWS, it is useful to take a step back and underline
that they need not necessarily take the shape of a specific weapon
system akin to, for instance, a drone or a missile. AWS also do not
require a specific military-technology development path, the way nuclear
weapons do, for example. As AI, autonomous systems and robot
technologies mature and begin to pervade the civilian sphere, militaries
will increasingly be able to make use of them for their own purposes, as
the development of information and communication technology suggests.
Naturally, any military adaptation of a dual-use technology will need to
fulfil specific military requirements that do not exist in a civilian
environment, or are less relevant for mass markets. Nevertheless, AWS
development will profit from the implementation or mirroring of a
variety of civilian technologies (or derivatives thereof) and their
adoption for military purposes, technologies which are currently either
already available or on the cusp of becoming ready for series production
in the private sector. This trend is already observable in the case of
armed drones. Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems are another
example. These are the optical sensors used by the automotive industry
to give self-driving cars a 360-degree picture of their surroundings.
LIDAR prices have recently dropped from five figures to a few hundred
dollars. The units have also become more rugged and much smaller.26
Given that these components, which are necessary for endowing mobile
systems with autonomy, are now cheaply and readily available off the
shelf, there is every reason to expect the military to adapt, and, if
required, adjust and refine, them for their own purposes.27 It is clear
that the research and development for AWS-relevant technology is well
under way and distributed across countless university laboratories and,
especially, commercial enterprises that are making use of economies of
scale and the forces of the free market to spur competition, lower
prices and shorten innovation cycles. This renders the military research
and development effort in the case of AWS different from those of past
high-tech conventional weapon systems (the F-35 comes to mind), let
alone nuclear weapons. So while the impact of AWS might be revolutionary
in terms of their implications for warfare, their development within the
context of the military is best described as evolutionary: the military
is merely continuing and, with outside help and technology lifted from
the private sector, accelerating an already existing trend to replace
labour with capital and automate dull, dirty and dangerous military
tasks.28 For example, former secretary of defense Ashton Carter sought
closer ties with Silicon Valley to hasten the incorporation of
technological innovations into the US military after the US officially
declared AI and robotics cornerstones of its new 'third offset' strategy
to counter rising powers.29 Thus, AWS are easy to obtain compared with
other paradigm-shifting weapons, such as nuclear weapons, which even now
require the Herculean effort of a state-run, focused politico-military
effort to produce. AWS do not require ores, centrifuges, high-speed
fuses or other comparably 'exotic' components to be assembled and tested
in a clandestine manner. [Consequently, while nuclear technologies can
be -- and are -- proliferation controlled, AWS are much harder to
regulate.]{.underline} With comparatively fewer choke points that might
be targeted by non-proliferation policies, [AWS are potentially
available to a wide range of state and non-state actors, not just those
nation-states that are willing and able to muster the considerable
resources needed for the robotic equivalent of the Manhattan Project. 30
This carries significant implications for arms control.]{.underline}
There will of course be differences in quality. Sophisticated AWS will
have to meet the same or similar military standards that current weapon
systems, such as main battle tanks or combat aircraft, do. Moreover,
[technologically leading nations such as the US and Israel are carrying
out research to produce autonomous systems that comply with
international humanitarian law. Less scrupulous actors, however, will
find AWS development much easier]{.underline}. Comparably crude AWS
which do not live up to the standards of a professional military in
terms of reliability, compliance with international humanitarian law or
the ability to go head-to-head with systems of a near-peer competitor
could, in fact, be put together with technology available today by
second- or third-tier state actors, and perhaps even non-state actors.
Converting a remotely controlled combat drone to autonomously fire a
weapon in response to a simple pattern-recognising algorithm is already
doable. Even the technological edge displayed by sophisticated AWS is
unlikely to be maintained over the longer term. While sensor and weapon
packages to a large degree determine the overall capabilities of a
system, implementing autonomy ultimately comes down to software, which
is effortlessly copied and uniquely vulnerable to being stolen via
computernetwork operations. Thus, while the development of AWS clearly
presents a challenge to less technologically advanced actors, [obtaining
AWS with some degree of military capability is a feasible goal for any
country already developing, for example, remotely controlled armed
UAVs]{.underline} -- the number of which rose from two to ten between
2001 and 2016.31 Admittedly, the US and Israel are still in the lead
with regard to developing unmanned systems and implementing
autonomous-weapon functionality -- China only recently test-fired a
guided missile from a drone via satellite link for the first time.32 But
considering that drone programmes can draw from the vibrant global
market for unmanned aerial vehicles of all shapes and sizes, the hurdles
regarding AWS are much lower than those of other potentially
game-changing weapons of the past. [Proliferation of AWS could of course
also occur via exports, including to the grey and black
markets]{.underline}. In this way, autonomous systems could fall not
only into the hands of technologically inferior state actors, but also
those of non-state actors, including extremist groups. Hamas, Hezbollah
and the Islamic State have already deployed and used armed drones. As
sensors and electronics are increasingly miniaturised, small and easily
transportable systems could be made autonomous with respect to
navigation, target recognition, precision and unusual modes of attack.33
[Terrorist groups could also gain access to comparably sophisticated
systems that they could never develop on their own. Again, autonomy in
this context does not necessarily require military-grade precision -- a
quick and dirty approach would suffice for these actors.]{.underline} In
fact, [it stands to reason that terrorist groups would use autonomous
killing capabilities indiscriminately in addition to using them, if
possible, in a precise fashion for targeted assassinations.]{.underline}
It is still unclear how the development of unmanned systems on the one
hand and specific countermeasures on the other will play out.
Traditional aircraft-sized drones such as the X-47B or Taranis, to stick
with these examples, are obviously susceptible to existing anti-aircraft
systems. As for smaller-sized systems, various tools, from microwaves to
lasers to rifle-sized radio jammers for disrupting the control link, are
currently being developed as countermeasures. Simpler, less exotic
methods such as nets, fences or even trained hunting birds might also
prove effective for remotely controlled and autonomous systems alike. It
is clear, however, that saturation attacks have been identified as a key
future capability for defeating a wide range of existing and upcoming
defensive systems -- both human-operated and automatic.34 The latter are
a particular focus of research into swarming as a potential solution.35
And military systems operating at very high speeds and in great numbers
or swarms are bound to generate new instabilities, to which we will turn
in our next section. To first sum up our argument so far, [there are
obvious dual-use problems and an unusually high risk of proliferation
when it comes to AWS]{.underline}. [Should one of the technologically
leading nation-states go forward with the deployment of AWS, it would be
comparably easy -- and thus very likely -- that others would follow
suit.]{.underline}36 In that sense, **[the development of AWS could well
trigger a destabilising arms race.]{.underline}** Crisis instability and
escalation Increasing operational speeds mean that human involvement in
AWS would be limited to, at best, general oversight and decision-making
in instances where communication delays of up to a few seconds -- and
thinking and deliberation times of a few minutes -- could be deemed
acceptable, meaning they would not result in defeat or the loss of
systems. Many situations would not allow for the luxury of human
pondering, however. In such cases, [the actions and reactions of
individual AWS, as well as AWS swarms, would have to be controlled
autonomously by algorithms]{.underline} -- in other words determined
only by programming software in advance and possibly through the
adaptation and learning of the systems themselves. After all, as Paul
Scharre put it, 'winning in swarm combat may depend upon having the best
algorithms to enable better coordination and faster reaction times,
rather than simply the best platforms'.37 [One such swarm-combat
situation could be a severe political crisis in which adversaries
believe that war could break out. With swarms deployed in close
proximity to each other, control software would have to react to signs
of an attack within a split-second time frame -- by evading or,
possibly, counter-attacking in a use-them-or-lose-them
situation.]{.underline} [Even **false indications of an attack** -- sun
glint interpreted as a rocket flame, sudden and unexpected moves of the
adversary, or a simple malfunction -- **could trigger escalation**. The
nature of military conflict is such that these kinds of interactions
could not be tested or trained for beforehand.]{.underline} In addition,
it is, technically speaking, impossible to fathom all possible outcomes
in advance. Clearly, [the interaction of swarms, if fully autonomous,
would be unpredictable, and could potentially result in an escalation
from crisis to war, or, within armed conflict, to higher levels of
violence.]{.underline} This is not a theoretical proposition deduced
solely from systems theory and the argument of unavoidable 'normal
accidents'.38 On the contrary, comparable runaway interactions between
algorithms are already happening in the civilian sphere on a regular
basis. In April 2011, the price of an out-of-print biology textbook rose
within weeks to \$23.7 million on the Amazon marketplace due to the
price-setting algorithms of two vendors interacting with each other.39
Eventually one of the vendors intervened; no damage was done because
nobody purchased the book at this absurd price. Greater havoc was caused
in the New York Stock Exchange 'flash crash' of 6 May 2010 in which
computerised highfrequency trading played an essential role, and during
which stock indices and important industry stocks collapsed.40 In this
case 'circuit breakers' established by monitoring authorities set in,
suspending high-speed trading and preventing further avalanche effects.
These oversight and intervention mechanisms have been improved since
then, but debate continues as to whether they are sufficient to prevent
another significant flash crash; minicrashes and interventions occur
daily.41 [During the Cold War, and even afterwards, both the US and the
Soviet Union received erroneous indications of nuclear attack on
multiple occasions.]{.underline}42 [These varied from sunlight reflected
off clouds to magnetic training tapes fed into the early-warning system
by accident. In all these cases, human reasoning led to restraint
instead of escalation; double checks revealed that the alarm had been
false]{.underline}. At the time, double checking and reconsideration
were possible due to flight times of between several hours (in the case
of bombers and cruise missiles) and 10--30 minutes (for ballistic
missiles launched from submarines or those covering intercontinental
ranges), as well as systems for preventing unwanted crisis escalation,
such as the 'hotline' for communication between Moscow and Washington
established after the Cuban Missile Crisis. Humans, or rapid-reaction
mechanisms preprogrammed by humans, can also act as a fail-safe in
instances where an overarching authority exists to enforce a shared set
of rules, as in the stockexchange example -- unlike in international
politics. [With the goal of improved military effectiveness providing a
strong incentive to increase operational speeds, and thus to allow AWS
to operate without further human intervention,]{.underline} tried and
tested mechanisms for double-checking and reconsideration that allow
humans to function as fail-safes or circuit-breakers are discarded[.
This, in combination with unforeseeable algorithm interactions producing
unforeseeable military outcomes, increases crisis instability and is
unpleasantly reminiscent of Cold War scenarios of accidental
war.]{.underline} Setting aside the increasing risk of unwanted
escalation, [AWS are also bound to introduce stronger incentives for
premeditated (including surprise) attacks. This is because of a
combination of three factors: casualty avoidance, cost reduction and,
once again, swarming]{.underline}. Firstly, unmanned systems, generally
speaking, keep soldiers out of harm's way -- which is positive, but
which also reduces the political risk of military endeavours, especially
in democracies.43 Referring to the current generation of combat drones,
Christof Heyns, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial,
summary or arbitrary executions, put it this way: '\[Drones\] make it
easier for States to deploy deadly and targeted force on the territories
of other States.'44 As unmanned systems become faster and smaller, as
well as, eventually, autonomous -- which will also make them stealthier
due to radio silence, and allow them to become 'swarmier' -- the
resulting room for manoeuvre in political and military terms increases.
Secondly, the example of Perdix demonstrates that AWS need not be big,
costly or high-tech. Instead, such systems can be cheap and disposable,
produced using 3D printers and gaining strength from numbers, their
'intelligence' residing in a distributed fashion in the swarm or, if
external communication is an option, at some higher level within the
military 'system of systems' at large. A closely related third
consideration is that swarms would make mounting a successful defence
especially difficult due to their resilience and their ability to attack
from many directions, simultaneously, in an overwhelming fashion. Small
and very small AWS (those measuring tens of centimetres at most) would
suffer from limited power supply on board, but could be brought closer
to the target by riding along on 'motherships', as has been demonstrated
with Perdix. With payloads weighing a few hundred grams at most, the
amount of destructive power of small drones would be limited too. But if
directed at political or military leaders or sensitive military
infrastructure, they would produce relevant damage and provide entirely
new means for carrying out assassinations and decapitation strikes.45
None of these points in isolation would introduce a radically novel
element to military decision-making. After all, the fact that a weapon
is cheap does not necessarily render it more likely to be used.46
However, [the combination of these three factors -- brought about mainly
by the development of hard-to-defend-against autonomous swarms --
presents a strong incentive to seize the advantage of being the first on
the offensive. Considering the current climate between Russia and NATO,
it stands to reason that old mechanisms of threat perception and
worst-case thinking might see a comeback in the wake of AWS
deployment]{.underline}.47 [Russia was reportedly alarmed when the idea
of using stealthy drones for missile defence was floated in the
US]{.underline}.48 Swarms of AWS could be used to attack nuclear-weapon
delivery systems, command and control systems, and sensitive
infrastructure components such as antennas, sensors or air intakes.
[Even though an attacker might have little interest or confidence in the
success of a disarming first strike of this type, the fact that such
strikes were now possible would in itself increase nervousness and
distrust between nuclear-armed adversaries.]{.underline} This overlap
between the conventional and the nuclear realm is not new, of course. It
emerged with precision munitions and bunker-busting (or possibly
electromagnetic-pulse) warheads during the 1990s and 2000s,49 and is
also documented in the New START treaty, the preamble of which states
that the US and Russia are 'mindful of the impact of conventionally
armed ICBMs and SLBMs on strategic stability'.50 [But AWS will likely
perpetuate and intensify this trend, not least by opening up new
possibilities for holding nuclear submarines carrying ballistic missiles
at risk]{.underline}.51 Thus, when nuclear weapons or strategic command
and control systems are, or are perceived to be, at greater risk,
conventional capabilities end up increasing instability at the strategic
level. [Today's unmanned systems have already increased the risk that
military force will be used in scenarios where manned systems would
previously have presented decision-makers with bigger, caution-inducing
hurdles -- a connection recently confirmed in war-gaming
exercises]{.underline}.52 Of course, swarming AWS need not necessarily
lead to escalation under all conditions. In asymmetric scenarios
involving adversaries who lack AWS capabilities, the escalatory
mechanisms developed above would not take effect. In symmetric settings,
by contrast, they would certainly exacerbate the overall development
toward an increased risk of crisis instability and escalation.

### ! Drones-- Qualitatively Worse

#### Capital intensive wars will be more qualitatively worse -- Jevons paradox 

**Shay 16** - Christopher Shay is a PhD student at the University of
Denver's Josef Korbel School of International Studies., The Jevons
Paradox and the Economy of Drone Strikes,
<https://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2016/06/24/the-jevons-paradox-and-the-economy-of-drone-strikes/)>

William Stanley Jevons first described his dilemma (also referred to as
the Jevons Paradox) in 1865 at a time when many British scholars feared
the exhaustion of natural coal reserves, a strategic resource on which
the British Navy depended. Some industrialists argued that advances in
coal-burning technology would progressively diminish coal consumption,
and thereby increase effective reserves. Jevons, however, observed that
demand for coal was elastic: as technology made coal consumption more
efficient, demand for coal increased drastically, and so did absolute
levels of consumption. Since 1865, economists have creatively applied
Jevons' logic to environmental economics. For example, they show that
[staggering advances in lighting technology since the Stone Age have
resulted in even greater total energy consumption]{.underline}. A
similar pattern has been studied in the automotive industry. This same
logic shows that drone technology, though increasingly discriminate, may
nevertheless increase total civilian fatalities in the long run. The
advantage of drone strikes lies in their accuracy and precision -- just
as coal-burning engines were made to produce more energy with less coal,
drones produce more militant deaths at the expense of fewer civilian
deaths. In other words, as strikes kill fewer civilians per militant,
they become more efficient and less costly. Conventional wisdom on
terrorism suggests that insurgencies like the Taliban use terror tactics
to provoke a violent, indiscriminate overreaction on the part of
governments they attack. This violent overreaction is expected by
militants to disproportionately affect civilians, who will subsequently
mobilize to support the insurgency. This provocation trap would, of
course, undermine the counter-insurgency and support insurgents'
long-term goals. The conventional view on drone warfare is that the
efficiency of drone strikes offers policymakers a means of punishing
insurgents without producing a disproportionate effect on civilians.
That is, [drones supposedly help US counter-insurgency efforts to evade
the provocation trap. Do they? The [Jevons Dilemma subjects this claim
to]{.mark} some [skepticism]{.mark}]{.underline} by suggesting that the
increasing efficiency of drone technology makes policymakers
disproportionately more likely to employ it. This could be problematic
from a strategic standpoint. Just as decreases in the cost of coal
consumption increased consumption of coal, the reduced cost of
counter-terror strikes may increase their perceived utility and,
subsequently, the readiness with which American policymakers and
commanders use them. In essence, because the tactic now appears more
efficient, leaders will be tempted to utilize it with excessive
regularity. To use an example, a hypothetical cruise missile strike may
kill a high-profile militant leader at the cost of 20 civilian lives. A
drone strike would kill the same militant at the cost of only 10
civilians. US leaders therefore use the drone, rather than the missile,
and kill the target while sparing 10 civilians. However, [[because the
drone renders]{.mark} individual [militants less costly to kill]{.mark},
US [leaders decide to kill]{.mark} the original target and
[additional]{.mark}, lower-profile [militants]{.mark} who they would not
previously have targeted]{.underline}. [[This is the]{.mark}
(postulated) [elasticity of demand]{.mark} amongst US leaders [for
strikes]{.mark} against militants. This elasticity exerts a system-level
effect: [leaders are tempted to authorize more and more strikes]{.mark}
until the original savings in civilian lives become more than offset by
costs incurred from additional (at least three, in this case) strikes
--- **strikes [that would not have been launched in the first place
without]{.mark} drone [tech]{.mark}nology**.]{.underline} Presumably,
civilian populations do not care that drones increase the efficiency of
counter-insurgency operations per strike; rather, they care that
civilian deaths have occurred as a result of those strikes. As the
absolute number of civilian deaths rises --- and insurgents will ensure
civilians are aware of this rise --- drone strikes will eventually
exhaust the forbearance of the public and increase mobilization into the
insurgency. In countries where civilians resent drone strikes as
assaults on their national sovereignty, the sheer number of strikes may
also work to exhaust the public's forbearance.

## TERRORISM

### 1nc -- Terrorism 

#### Democracy promotion causes terrorism\-\--prefer a [holistic analysic]{.underline} of US counter terror policy

**Morris et al. 20 ---** Morris, N. A., LaFree, G., &amp; Karlidag, E.
(2020). Counter‐terrorism policies in the Middle East: Why democracy has
failed to reduce terrorism in the Middle East and why protecting human
rights might be more successful. Criminology &amp; Public Policy, 20(1),
153--175. <https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9133.12532> WMK

Much of [US foreign policy aimed at reducing terrorism]{.underline} in
the Middle East following the 9/11 attacks [emphasized increasing the
**strength of democratic institutions**]{.underline} in the region. In
particular, [this was a **cornerstone**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
President George W. [Bush\'s policy in the Middle East]{.underline}. By
contrast, while state-based human rights violations sometimes provoke a
negative response from US officials, they are rarely seen as an
important avenue for achieving regional stability and decreasing
terrorism. In several speeches President Barack Obama pointed out the
importance of state-based human rights violations, but did not provide a
systematic policy advancing the reduction of human rights violations as
a counter terrorism measure in the Middle East. President Donald Trump
has shown little interest in the records of Middle Eastern countries in
terms of either democracy or state-based human rights violations
(Washington Post, 2020). Indeed, the Trump administration has generally
seen enforcing sanctions against Middle Eastern countries for human
rights violations as a barrier to trade and therefor inadvisable (New
York Times, 2017).

Although a growing number of worldwide studies examine the relationship
between democracy, human rights violations and terrorist attacks, few
studies focus exclusively on the countries of the Middle East. Based on
prior research we hypothesized that because the Middle East is
characterized by exceptionally weak democracies, within-country
[increases in the **strength of democracy**]{.underline} in the Middle
East [will lead to **increases in terrorist attacks**]{.underline}
(Hypothesis 1). We also hypothesized that because Middle Eastern
countries are concentrated in the lower half of strength of democracy
measures, we will not find a curvilinear effect of democracy on
country-level terrorist attacks for this region (Hypothesis 2).
Furthermore, we hypothesized that state-based human rights violations in
the Middle East may well be more important than strength of democracy
and hypothesized that human rights violations will be associated with
increases in terrorist attacks in that region (Hypothesis 3). Our
[results show **consistent support**]{.underline} for all three
hypotheses.

We found that [from 1980 to 2016, increases]{.underline} **[in the
strength of democracy]{.underline}** a[re associated wit]{.underline}h
**[significant increases in terrorist attacks]{.underline}** among
Middle Eastern countries. Also, as hypothesized, but in contrast to some
recent worldwide studies of terrorism (e.g., Gaibulloev et al., 2017;
Sandler, 2014), we find no significant support for a curvilinear
relationship between democracy strength and terrorist attacks among
Middle Eastern countries. We argue that this outcome is a likely
consequence of the fact that most previous studies of terrorist attacks
have examined worldwide samples with large numbers of mature
democracies. By contrast, our descriptive data on 18 Middle Eastern
countries shows that most are autocratic or anocratic.

#### Terrorism goes nuclear.

Network. She holds a degree in physics, a Master's in business

Arguello previously worked on nuclear projects for the Argentine
National Atomic Energy Commission. (Irma, "The global impacts of a
terrorist nuclear attack: What would happen? What should we do?",
*Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists*)

Though hard to accept, [the detonation of a **nuclear
device**]{.underline} -- [by]{.underline} states or **[non-state
actors]{.underline}** -- [is]{.underline} today a
**[plausible]{.underline}** scenario. And while much of the world's
focus has been on the current nuclear weapons arsenals possessed by
states -- about 14,550 warheads, all of which carry the risk of
intentional or unintentional use -- [[the **threat of
nuc**]{.mark}**lear [terrorism]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} **here** and
**[increasing]{.mark}**. For more than a decade, **Al Qaeda**, Aum
Shinrikyo, and other **[terrorist groups]{.mark}** have
[expressed]{.mark} their [desire to **acquire fissile
material**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to **build** and **detonate**
a]{.underline}]{.mark}n improvised **[[nuc]{.mark}lear
bomb]{.underline}**. [None of them could fulfill that goal]{.underline}
-- so far. [But that does not mean that they **will not succeed in the
future**.]{.underline} Making matters worse, there is evidence of an
illicit market for nuclear weapons-usable materials. There are sellers
in search of potential buyers, as shown by the dismantlement of a
nuclear smuggling network in Moldova in 2015. There certainly are plenty
of sites from which to obtain nuclear material. According to the 2016
Nuclear Security Index by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, 24 countries
still host inventories of nuclear weapons-usable materials, stored in
facilities with different degrees of security. And in terms of risk, it
is not necessary for a given country to possess nuclear weapons,
weapons-usable materials, or nuclear facilities for it to be useful to
nuclear terrorists: Structural and institutional weaknesses in a country
may make it favorable for the illicit trade of materials. Permeable
boundaries, high levels of corruption, weaknesses in judicial systems,
and consequent impunity may give rise to a series of transactions and
other events, which could end in a nuclear attack. The truth is that, at
this stage, no country in possession of nuclear weapons or
weapons-usable materials can guarantee their full protection against
nuclear terrorism or nuclear smuggling. Because we live in a world of
growing insecurity, where explicit and tacit agreements between the
relevant powers -- which upheld global stability during the post-Cold
War -- are giving way to increasing mistrust and hostility, a question
arises: How would our lives be affected if a current terrorist group
such as the Islamic State (ISIS), or new terrorist groups in the future,
succeed in evolving from today's Manchester style "low-tech" attacks to
a "high-tech" one, involving a nuclear bomb, detonated in a capital
city, anywhere in the world? We attempted to answer this question in a
report developed by a high-level multidisciplinary expert group convened
by the NPSGlobal Foundation for the Latin American and Caribbean
Leadership Network. We found that there would be multiple harmful
effects that would spread promptly around the globe (Arguello and Buis
2016); a more detailed analysis is below, which highlights the need for
the creation of a comprehensive nuclear security system. The
consequences of a terrorist nuclear attack A small and primitive
1-kiloton fission bomb (with a yield of about one-fifteenth of the one
dropped on Hiroshima, and certainly much less sophisticated; cf. Figure
1), detonated in any large capital city of the developed world, would
cause an unprecedented catastrophic scenario. An estimate of direct
effects in the attack's location includes a death toll of
7,300-to-23,000 people and 12,600-to-57,000 people injured, depending on
the target's geography and population density. Total physical
destruction of the city's infrastructure, due to the blast (shock wave)
and thermal radiation, would cover a radius of about 500 meters from the
point of detonation (also known as ground zero), while ionizing
radiation greater than 5 Sieverts -- compatible with the deadly acute
radiation syndrome -- would expand within an 850-meter radius. From the
environmental point of view, such an area would be unusable for years.
In addition, radioactive fallout would expand in an area of about 300
square kilometers, depending on meteorological conditions (cf. Figure
2). But the consequences would go far beyond the effects in the target
country, however, and promptly propagate worldwide. Global and national
security, economy and finance, international governance and its
framework, national political systems, and the behavior of governments
and individuals would all be [put under severe trial.]{.underline} The
severity of the effects at a national level, however, would depend on
the countries' level of development, geopolitical location, and
resilience. **[Global security]{.underline}** and regional/national
defense schemes [would be **strongly affected**. [An **increase in
global distrust** would **spark rising tensions**]{.mark} among
countries [and]{.mark}]{.underline} blocs, that could even [[lead
to]{.mark} the **brink of [nuclear]{.mark} weapons [use]{.mark}** by
states]{.underline} ([if, for instance, a **sponsor country** is
identified]{.underline}). [The [consequences]{.mark} of such a shocking
scenario would [include]{.mark} a **decrease** in states'
**self-control**, [an **escalation of**]{.mark} **present
[conflicts]{.mark}** [and the **emergence of new ones**]{.mark},
accompanied by an **increase in military unilateralism**]{.underline}
and military expenditures.

### I/L Terrorism

#### **Democracy causes terrorism**

**Savun**, Poli Sci Prof @ Pitt, **9**

(Burcu, Democracy, Foreign Policy, and Terrorism, Journal of Conflict
Resolution Volume XX Number X, pp. online)

Many scholars, particularly within the past decade, have argued that
[[democratic states are **more likely** to be targets of **transnational
terrorism**]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to this camp, there are
various aspects of the democratic regimes that facilitate terrorism.
First, [democracies]{.underline}, [[by providing freedom of
organization, expression, and movement]{.mark}]{.underline} for their
citizens, [[enable terrorist]{.mark} group[s]{.mark} [to
undertake]{.mark} their [illegal activities]{.mark} with relative
ease]{.underline} (Engene 2004; Hamilton and Hamilton 1983). The
commitment to civil liberties in democratic societies can be used by
terrorist groups to organize and carry out their attacks without being
noticed (Eubank and Weinberg 1994, 2001). [[Repressive regimes reduce
the ability of terrorist groups to organize]{.mark} and carry out their
activities, whereas [democracies provide a **permissive**]{.mark}
**[environment]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Second, [**institutional
constraints** imposed on democratic governments are usually higher than
the ones **on other types of regimes**]{.underline}. Although these
constraints are intended to protect the citizens of democracies from the
undue exercise of power by their leaders, they also limit the actions
and ability of democratic governments to fight terrorism (Schmid 1992;
Li 2005; Wilkinson 1986, 2006). [[Terrorist]{.mark} group[s]{.mark}
[perceive democracies as **soft targets**]{.mark}]{.underline} [that can
be pressured to give into their demands [due to]{.mark} the
**[sensitivity]{.mark} of democracies [to costs]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
[Pape]{.underline} (2003, 2005) [shows that terrorist groups tend to
target democracies more frequently because they know that **liberal
democracies** usually]{.underline} [accede to **their
demands**]{.underline}. [Freedom of press is another factor that is
argued to encourage transnational terrorism in democracies.]{.underline}
A free press serves the interests of terrorist groups whose main goal is
to advertise their cause to a wide audience and gain publicity and
recognition (Crenshaw 1981). [Unlike in repressive regimes, terrorist
incidents are more likely to be reported in detail by the free press in
democratic societies]{.underline}. Therefore, [[press freedom]{.mark} in
democracies [gives a]{.mark} valuable [opportunity to publicity-hungry
terrorists **to create widespread fear**]{.mark} (]{.underline}Li 2005;
Nacos 1994).

#### Prefer our stats -- theirs are based on all democracies -- ours assume the unique vulnerabilities created by transitioning regimes which is what we are impact turning 

**Lutz**, Poli Sci Prof @ Indiana, **10**

(James, Democracy and Terrorism, Perspectives on Terrorism 4.1 p.
online)

[A number of factors may help to explain these mixed
results]{.underline}. Somewhat limited number of international
incidents, compared to domestic attacks (which outnumber international
incidents by a factor of seven or more), has meant that singular events
with high casualties are statistical outliers that could have affected
the results. In addition, [i[f **regimes in transition** are]{.mark}
actually **[mo]{.mark}re [vulnerable]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the
[presence of changes in the political system could be a confounding
factor]{.mark}. A [transition from one **authoritarian regime to
another**]{.mark}]{.underline} (military regime to a one-party system or
vice versa) [[could **increase opportunities** for
terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark} that would not necessarily be associated
with democratization. **[[Iran]{.mark},]{.underline}** for example,
[[underwent]{.mark} a period of [terrorism initiated by secular and
leftist]{.mark} [groups that lasted for 18 month]{.mark}s. The clerical
regime of the new Islamic Republic was vulnerable since it was making
the transition from the partial authoritarianism of the old monarchy to
the totalitarianism of the new theocracy]{.underline}. \[30\] Similarly,
[[if new democracies are indeed more prone to terrorism, the association
between **terrorism and democracy** could be **more variable** since
**not all democracies are equally vulnerable.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

The early [21st Century]{.underline} has been notewor[thy for a marked
increase in the number of governments willing to act against the
interests of their electors]{.underline} -- and the number of electors
prepared to vote against their own best interests and choose such
governments. [Since an educated, thoughtful and responsible
electorate]{.underline} is **[indispensable to any
democracy]{.underline}** that wishes to choose a safe, rational and,
healthy future for itself it is fair to conclude that, if this trend
persists, the three-century-long worldwide **[democratic experiment will
fail.]{.underline}** Whether the failure is attributable to large-scale
corruption of the democratic process by global corporates of rising
wealth and power, to increased selfishness in politics and society, or
to rising stupidity on the part of 21st Century Homo sapiens both in
politics and in the general community is still open to debate. In Earth
Detox, (Cambridge University Press 2021) I explore evidence for the
latter hypothesis -- that [humans are]{.underline}, in fact, [becoming
**progressively less intelligent**]{.underline}. So dumb, in fact, that
[most do not grasp we are in mortal danger]{.underline}
**[from]{.underline}** ten vast, **[interconnected mega
threats.]{.underline}** Consequently, [voters]{.underline} now
[frequently choose governments]{.underline} that either **[increase
these threats -- or which are too slothful or corrupt to abate
them.]{.underline}** The missing piece of [information is that all
humanity is now engulfed]{.underline}, 24/7, in a flooding tide of toxic
[chemistry -- a tide five or six times larger than our climate
emissions]{.underline}, and more [deadly than any previous threat to
human existence]{.underline}. An [environmental threat]{.underline}
that, according to WHO, [kills over thirteen million people every
year]{.underline} -- the worst death toll from a single cause in human
history -- and disables 600 million more. Why electors should vote for
such an outcome for themselves and their children demands explanation.
One explanation may be that [our intelligence]{.underline}, the quality
that humans have most prided themselves on down the ages, [**is in
decline.** After a marked increase in human intelligence during the
first three-quarters of the twentieth century]{.underline} -- a
phenomenon known as the Flynn Effect, after the NZ psychologist who
discovered it -- [recent scientific research points to]{.underline} a
**[clear downturn in human brainpower since 1975.]{.underline}** The
[average rate of decline has been around three IQ points a
decad]{.underline}e, amounting to the loss of [about 13.5 percent in
average intelligence between 1975 and 2020.]{.underline} Results from
separate studies carried out in seven different countries describe a
general loss of intelligence. So far, researchers have been unable to
confidently assign a cause to this noteworthy decline, saying only that
it is not genetic and [must therefore be due to something in society's
living environment.]{.underline} The great question is: what has changed
so much in society's living conditions as to cause such extensive brain
damage during the past 45 years in particular? Increasingly, science
suspects the [2.3 billion tonnes per year of man-made
chemicals]{.underline} -- **[many of them nerve poisons]{.underline}**
-- [which]{.underline} industrial society has [unleashed on itself
during this period a]{.underline}nd which now **[permeate our air, our
food, our water, our homes, workplaces, our bodies, and our
genes]{.underline}** on a daily basis. [Substances to
which]{.underline}, such is their universal distribution around the
planet, **[almost all humans are now exposed every moment of their
existence]{.underline}** from conception to expiry and which are, for
the most part, unavoidable. The impact of these nerve poisons is
compounded by a second, related, chemical flood -- the endocrine
disruptors (EDCs), industrial chemicals which affect basic processes
like our growth, development, gender, ability to reproduce, obesity, and
cancer risk. Nerve poisons are now thought by medical scientists to play
a significant role in the pandemic of brain diseases that have become
more prevalent in recent decades -- conditions such as autism and ADHD,
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, depression, and other mental disorders,
retarded development and the loss of intelligence. According to various
studies, mental conditions now affect 800 million human beings -- one in
ten -- imposing a vast and growing cost on the world economy for the
care of the disabled. Brain damage caused by nerve poisons has been
known since ancient Rome and well understood by science for decades.
Lead and mercury used to be the chief offenders, but in recent times
they have been supplanted by certain pesticides and domestic chemicals,
such as flame retardants and plastics. These are now found in the blood
and brains of unborn babies as well as much of the population. A decline
of seven IQ points translates the average citizen to the intelligence
level of the average juvenile delinquent. It is therefore probable that
the decline in human intelligence is being accompanied by an increase in
rates of murder, rape, and violent assault -- as well as a lack of
forethought at the ballot box. Proving that nerve poisons are
responsible for the decline in democracy is no easier than proving that
cigarettes cause cancer -- but the connections are now evident for all
who care to look. William of Occam would note that human IQ is falling
at the same time as the toxic load on society is redoubling -- and we
are witnessing tens of millions of voters without the ability to grasp
their responsibility, the needs of their society, or even themselves.
Voters who may, on occasion, incoherently seek to overthrow or sabotage
through misinformation the very system they do not comprehend. Voters
who are increasingly susceptible to the misinformation circulated by
vested interests, such as the petro lobby. Occam would advise us to look
a lot more carefully at the most likely explanation, first -- a task
that science has yet to undertake. [Democracies have long asserted a
moral as well as **governmental superiority over
autocracies**]{.underline}, [but with the **decay in voter
intelligence**]{.underline}, that [advantage is becoming **far less
clear**]{.underline}. If democracy is to endure as a form of
self-governance, then the need to remedy the dumbing-down of democracy
by ceasing to poison the minds that uphold it is both imperative and
urgent.

whereas artificial intelligence need not be so restricted. We don\'t
need to compute the caloric value of foods, for example, we just feel
hungry. We don\'t need to calculate the waist-to-hip ratio of women or
the shoulder-to-waist ratio of men in our quest for genetically healthy
potential mates; we just feel attracted to someone and mate with them.
We don\'t need to work out the genetic cost of raising someone else\'s

need to figure the damage of an unfair or non-reciprocal exchange with
someone else; we just feel injustice and desire revenge. [Emotions

Paleolithic ancestors. Anger leads us to strike out, fight back, and
defend ourselves against danger. Fear causes us to pull back, retreat,
and escape from risks. Disgust directs us to push out, eject, and expel
that which is bad for us. [[Computing]{.mark} the [odds of
danger]{.mark} in any given situation [takes too long. We need to
**react instantly**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Emotions shortcut the
information processing power needed by brains that would otherwise
become bogged down with all the computations necessary for survival.
[Their purpose, in an ultimate causal sense, is to drive behaviors
toward goals selected by evolution to]{.underline} **[enhance
survival]{.underline}** and reproduction. **[[AIs]{.underline}]{.mark}**
\-- even AGIs and ASIs \-- [[will have **no need** of such
emotions]{.underline}]{.mark} and so there would be no reason to program
them in unless, say, terrorists chose to do so for their own evil
purposes. But that\'s a human nature problem, not a computer nature
issue. [[To believe]{.mark} that an [ASI would be]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[\"evil]{.mark}\"]{.underline}** in any emotional sense [is to
[assume]{.mark} a computer [cognition that includes]{.mark} such
[psychological traits]{.mark} as]{.underline} [**acquisitiveness**,
competitiveness, vengeance, and bellicosity, which seem to be
projections coming from the mostly]{.underline} **[male
writers]{.underline}** [who]{.underline} **[concoct]{.underline}** such
[**dystopias**, not features any **programmer**]{.underline}
[would]{.underline} [**bother including**, assuming that it]{.underline}
[**could even be done**. What would it mean to program an emotion into a
computer? When IBM\'s Deep Blue defeated chess master Garry
Kasparov]{.underline} in 1997, [did it feel **triumphant**]{.underline},
vengeful, or bellicose? [**Of course not**. It **wasn\'t even
\"aware\"** \-- in the human sense of self-conscious knowledge \-- that
it was]{.underline} [**playing chess**, much less feeling nervous about
possibly losing]{.underline} to the reigning world champion (which it
did in the first tournament played in 1996). In fact, toward the end of
the first game of the second tournament, on the 44th move, Deep Blue
made a legal but incomprehensible move of pushing its rook all the way
to the last row of the opposition side. It accomplished nothing
offensively or defensively, leading Kasparov to puzzle over it out of
concern that he was missing something in the computer\'s strategy. It
turned out to be an error in Deep Blue\'s programming that led to this
fail-safe default move. It was a bug that Kasparov mistook as a feature,
and as a result some chess experts contend it led him to be less
confident in his strategizing and to second-guess his responses in the
subsequent games. It even led him to suspect foul play and human
intervention behind Deep Blue, and this paranoia ultimately cost him the
tournamentt.\[ 13\] Computers don\'t get paranoid, the HAL 9000 computer
in 2001 notwithstanding. [Or consider **Watson**]{.underline}, the IBM
computer built by David Ferrucci and his team of IBM research scientists
tasked with designing an AI that could rival human champions at the game
of Jeopardy! This was a far more formidable challenge than Deep Blue
faced because of the prerequisite to understand language and the often
multiple meanings of words, not to mention needing an encyclopedic
knowledge of trivia (Watson had access to Wikipedia for this). After
beating the all-time greatest Jeopardy! champions Ken Jennings and Brad
Rutter in 2011, did Watson feel flushed with pride after its victory?
Did Watson even know that it won Jeopardy!? I put the question to none
other than Ferrucci himself at a dinner party in New York in conjunction
with the 2011 Singularity Summit. His answer surprised me: \"Yes,
[Watson knows it won Jeopardy!]{.underline}\" I was skeptical. How could
that be, since such self-awareness is not yet possible in computers?
\"[Because]{.underline} **[I told it]{.underline}** that it won,\" he
replied with a wry smile. Sure, and you could even program Watson or
Deep Blue to vocalize a Howard Dean-like victory scream when it wins,
but that is [still a]{.underline} **[far cry]{.underline}** [from a
computer feeling triumphant]{.underline}. [This brings to mind the
**\"hard problem\" of consciousness** \-- if we don\'t understand how
this happens in humans,]{.underline} **[how could we program it into
computers?]{.underline}** As Steven Pinker elucidated in his answer to
the 2015 Edge Question on what to think about machines that think, [\"AI
dystopias project a]{.underline} [**parochial alpha-male psychology**
onto the]{.underline} [**concept of intelligence**. They assume that
superhumanly intelligent robots would develop **goals** like **deposing
their masters**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} [**taking over the
world.\"** It is **equally possible**]{.underline}, Pinker suggests,
[that \"**[a]{.mark}**rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence [will]{.mark}
**naturally [develop]{.mark}** along]{.underline} female
[lines]{.underline}: fully capable of solving problems, but [[with **no
desire to annihilate**]{.mark} **innocents** or **dominate the
civilization**]{.underline}.\"\[ 14\] So [the fear that computers will
become emotionally evil are unfounded, because without the suite of
these evolved emotions [it will **never occur**]{.mark} **to AIs** [to
take such actions]{.mark} against us]{.underline}. [What about an ASI
**inadvertently**]{.underline} [causing]{.underline} our
[extinction]{.underline} by turning us into paperclips, or tiling the
entire Earth\'s surface with solar panels? [Such scenarios imply yet
another emotion \-- the feeling of]{.underline}
**[valuing]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[wanting
something]{.underline}**. As the science writer Michael Chorost adroitly
notes, [when humans resist an AI from undertaking any form of global
tiling, it \"will have to be able to]{.underline} **[imagine
counteractions]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**want to carry them
out**.\" Yet, \"[until]{.mark} an AI has [feelings, it\'s going to be
unable to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**want [to do anything]{.mark} at all**,
let alone **act counter to humanity\'s interests**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[fight off human resistance]{.underline}**.\"
Further, Chorost notes, \"the minute an A.I. wants anything, it will
live in a universe with rewards and punishments \-- including
punishments from us for behaving badly. In order [to survive in a world
dominated by humans, a nascent A.I. will have to develop a humanlike
moral sense that certain things are right and others are wrong. By the
time it\'s in a position to **imagine** tiling the Earth with solar
panels, it\'ll **know that it would be morally wrong**]{.underline} to
do so.\"\[ 15\] From here Chorost builds on an argument made by Peter
Singer in The Expanding Circle (and Steven Pinker in The Better Angels
of Our Nature\[ 16\] that I also developed in The Moral Arc\[ 17\] and
Robert Wright explored in Nonzero\[ 18\]), and that is the propensity
for natural intelligence to evolve moral emotions that include
reciprocity, cooperativeness, and even altruism. Natural intelligences
such as ours also includes the capacity to reason, and once you are on
Singer\'s metaphor of the \"escalator of reason\" it can carry you
upward to genuine morality and concerns about harming others.
\"Reasoning is inherently expansionist. It seeks universal
application,\" Singer notes.\[ 19\] Chorost draws the implication:
\"[AIs will have to step on the escalator of reason just like humans
have, because they will need to]{.underline} **[bargain for goods in a
human-dominated economy]{.underline}** [and they will face **human
resistance to bad behavior**]{.underline}.\"\[ 20\] Finally, [for an AI
to get around this problem it would need to evolve emotions on its own,
but [the only way for this to happen]{.mark} in a world dominated by the
natural intelligence called humans [would be for]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**us** to **allow it**]{.mark} **to happen**, which we
**wouldn\'t**]{.underline} [because there\'s]{.underline} [**time enough
to see it coming**. **Bostrom\'s \"treacherous turn\" will come with
road signs ahead**]{.underline} warning us that there\'s a sharp bend in
the highway with enough time for us to grab the wheel. [Incremental
progress is what we see in most technologies, including and especially
AI, which will continue to serve us in **the manner we desire and
need**]{.underline}. Instead of Great Leap Forward or Giant Fall
Backward, think Small Steps Upward. As I proposed in The Moral Arc,
[instead of Utopia or dystopia, think **protopia**]{.underline}, a term
coined by the futurist Kevin Kelly, who described it in an Edge
conversation this way: \"I call myself a protopian, not a Utopian. I
believe in progress in an incremental way where every year it\'s better
than the year before but not by very much \-- just a micro amount.\"\[
21\] Almost all progress in science and technology, including computers
and AI, is of a protopian nature. Rarely, if ever, do technologies lead
to either Utopian or dystopian societies. Pinker agrees that [[there
is]{.underline} [**plenty of time** to plan]{.underline}]{.mark} [for
all conceivable contingencies and build safeguards into our AI systems.
\"They would not need any ponderous \'rules of robotics\' or some
newfangled **moral philosophy**]{.underline} [to do this, just the
same]{.underline} [**common sense** that went into the design
of]{.underline} [**food processors**, **table saws**, **space
heaters**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
**[automobiles]{.underline}**.\" [Sure, an ASI would be many orders of
magnitude]{.underline} **[smarter]{.underline}** [than
these]{.underline} machines, [but Pinker reminds us of the]{.underline}
[**AI hyperbole** we\'ve been fed for decades: \"The worry that an AI
system would be **so clever**]{.underline} at attaining one of the goals
programmed into it (like commandeering energy) [that it would **run
roughshod over**]{.underline} the **[others]{.underline}** (like human
safety) [assumes that AI will descend upon us **faster than we can
design fail-safe precautions**. The reality is that progress in AI
is]{.underline} [**hype-defyingly slow**, and there will be plenty of
time for feedback from incremental implementations, with humans wielding
the screwdriver at every stage.\"]{.underline}\[ 22\] Former Google CEO
Eric Schmidt agrees, responding to the fears expressed by Hawking and
Musk this way: [\"Don\'t you think the humans would notice this, and
start **turning off the computers**?\"]{.underline} He also noted the
irony in the fact that Musk has invested \$1 billion into a company
called OpenAI that is \"promoting precisely AI of the kind we are
describing.\"\[ 23\] [Google\'s own DeepMind has developed the concept
of an **AI off-switch**, playfully described as a **\"big red
button\"**]{.underline} to be pushed in the event of an attempted AI
takeover. \"We have proposed a framework to allow a human operator to
repeatedly safely interrupt a reinforcement learning agent while making
sure the agent will not learn to prevent or induce these
interruptions,\" write the authors Laurent Orseau from DeepMind and
Stuart Armstrong from the Future of Humanity Institute, in a paper
titled \"Safely Interruptible Agents.\" They even suggest a
precautionary scheduled shutdown every night at 2 AM for an hour so that
both humans and AI are accustomed to the idea. [\"Safe interruptibility
can be useful to take control of a robot that is
misbehaving]{.underline} and may lead to irreversible consequences, or
to take it out of a delicate situation, or even to temporarily use it to
achieve a task it did not learn to perform or would not normally receive
rewards for this.\"\[ 24\] [As well, it is good to keep in mind that
artificial intelligence is not the same as artificial **consciousness**.
Thinking machines **may not be sentient**]{.underline} machines.
Finally, Andrew Ng of Baidu responded to Elon Musk\'s ASI concerns by
noting (in a jab at the entrepreneur\'s ambitions for colonizing the red
planet) it would be \"like worrying about overpopulation on Mars when we
have not even set foot on the planet yet.\"\[ 25\] Both Utopian and
dystopian visions of AI are based on a projection of the future quite
unlike anything history has given us. Yet, even Ray Kurzweil\'s \"law of
accelerating returns,\" as remarkable as it has been has nevertheless
advanced at a pace that has allowed for considerable ethical
deliberation with appropriate checks and balances applied to various
technologies along the way. With time, [even if an unforeseen motive
somehow began to emerge in an AI we would have the **time to reprogram
it** before it got out of control]{.underline}. That is also the
judgment of Alan Winfield, an engineering professor and co-author of the
Principles of Robotics, a list of rules for regulating robots in the
real world that goes far beyond Isaac Asimov\'s famous three laws of
robotics (which were, in any case, designed to fail as plot devices for
science fictional narratives).26 Winfield points out that
[all]{.underline} of these [doomsday scenarios depend on a]{.underline}
[**long sequence of big ifs** to unroll sequentially:]{.underline} \"If
we succeed in building human equivalent AI and if that AI acquires a
full understanding of how it works, and if it then succeeds in improving
itself to produce super-intelligent AI, and if that super-AI,
accidentally or maliciously, starts to consume resources, and if we fail
to pull the plug, then, yes, we may well have a problem. [The risk,
while not impossible, is **improbable**]{.underline}.\"\[ 27\]

#### Chinese AI leadership is fine

Kai-Fu **Lee** **and** Paul **Triolo** **17**, Kai-Fu Lee, Ph.D., is a
Co-Founder, Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Managing
Partner of Sinovation Ventures, Paul Triolo is a China Digital Economy
Fellow at New America and the geo-technology practice head at the
Eurasia Group, "China's Artificial Intelligence Revolution:
Understanding Beijing's Structural Advantages",
<https://www.eurasiagroup.net/files/upload/China_Embraces_AI.pdf> //AP

Beijing's AI policy priorities are clear. [The "Next Generation
Artificial Intelligence Development Plan,"]{.underline} announced by
China's State Council in July 2017, [called for China to catch up on
AI]{.underline} technology and applications by 2020, and to become a
global AI innovation hub by 2030. Chinese President Xi Jinping hammered
the point home in his 19th Party Congress speech in October, when he
mentioned the development of advanced manufacturing and the promotion of
further integration of the Internet, big data and artificial
intelligence with the real-world economy. Beijing has placed huge bets
on AI for a host of political and economic reasons, from improving
governance capacity to improving policy development and surveillance.
[The plan calls for [China]{.mark} to [lead]{.mark} the way [in
developing a **regulatory environment** to]{.mark} both encourage AI
development and to **[mitigate the]{.mark}**]{.underline} potential
[**[downsides of AI.]{.mark}**]{.underline} A few months after the
national plan's announcement in July, the Ministry of Science and
Technology (MOST) designated Baidu to lead the autonomous vehicle
platform, Tencent for medical, Alibaba for Smart Cities, and iFlyTek for
speech interfaces. These plans should be taken seriously, as [the
[Chinese government has shown a strong track record]{.mark} in
delivering results.]{.underline} For example, Beijing announced in 2010
that China would become the world's leader in adopting high-speed rail
(HSR). Today it has 60% of the world's HSR market. In 2014, the Chinese
government announced the "Mass Entrepreneurship and Innovation Plan."
Today there are business 8000 incubators in China, compared to 1400 in
2014. These plans have teeth, both due to the deadlines and metrics set
out at the national level, as well as the local companies that are
likely to take these directions as top priorities. We can expect a
similar trajectory for China's AI policies. Historically, the Chinese
government has been open-minded towards technology development. When a
new technology comes out, the government will give it the benefit of
doubt and let it grow, rather than stifle it with policy or endless
debates. Also, the environment in China is more conducive to fast launch
and iteration. There is a general belief that it is better to launch
something and then get it approved later. This allows Chinese businesses
to generate real data at scale, which in turn allows technology to
improve over a shorter period of time, particularly once AI is
introduced into the equation. For example, while in the US, truckers'
unions are petitioning the Department of Transportation to delay
autonomous truck testing, in China, the Xiong'an New Area, a planned
smart city development southwest of Beijing, is being designed from the
ground up with full autonomy in mind. Various highway authorities are
willing to develop road augmentation, special lanes, or move warehouses
near highway exits, all to facilitate faster deployment of autonomous
trucks. We also see major initiatives in cities, following the central
government's call to action. Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Tianjin are
but a few of the cities coming out with their own AI initiatives. As
with past policies, much of the resources will be applied at the
provincial and city government levels. The types of
[r]{.underline}esources may include subsidies for top talent (especially
overseas talent); guidance for top VC funds, with the government playing
the role of limited partner (LP) but offering some of its upside to the
general partners (GPs) of the funds; special programs for top AI
companies and start-ups (free rent, subsidy for local hiring, housing
and private school for top talents); and technical awards for companies
and individuals. Finally, the US, EU, and [[China
will]{.mark}]{.underline} also compete to [be out [in front on
developing a regulatory regime]{.mark} around AI technologies and
applications.]{.underline} [The National Plan's explicit recognition of
the need for regulatory]{.underline}, legal, and ethical [principles for
AI development and use represents [an **uncommonly foresighted
approach**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Of course, the government's
approach to [AI regulation]{.underline}, ethics, and economic adjustment
[will [reflect]{.mark} Beijing's [broader model of **governance and
ideology**]{.mark}. Given its [preference for a **state-centric
approach**]{.mark} to]{.underline} international [issues]{.underline},
for example, [it is possible China will launch]{.underline} an
initiative via the UN to establish first [an
automation/AI]{.underline}-related "c[ode of conduct]{.underline}," [or
basic regulatory approach, followed by a special committee on the topic
and eventually an oversight body operating within a UN framework. Such
an [initiative]{.mark} would [put **China at the forefront of developing
a global approach**]{.mark} **to these issues.**]{.underline} Beijing
has attempted a similar approach on cybersecurity issues, which it
argues have a global impact and require a global regulatory response.

[Let's talk about \"possible\" for the moment. There are lots of things
that are possible, and philosophers love to talk about what's possible,
but [many things that are]{.mark} **obviously [possible are never going
to be actual]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It's possible to build a bridge
across the Atlantic. [**[We're not going to do it]{.mark},** not now,
not in a hundred years, **[not in a thousand years]{.mark}**. It would
cost too much money and would be a foolish endeavor]{.underline}. [A lot
of the imagined [AI projects]{.mark} that are perfectly
possible]{.underline} in principle [[are not worth
doing]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact, some of them are definitely things
that we shouldn't do because they'll make more problems for us than
they\'ll solve. Just bear that in mind. Somebody said that the
philosopher is the one who says, \"[We know it's possible in practice,
we're trying to figure out if it's possible in principle.\"]{.underline}
Unfortunately, [philosophers sometimes spend too much time worrying
about logical possibilities that are importantly negligible in every
other regar]{.underline}d. So, let me go on the record as saying, yes,
[I think that conscious AI is possible]{.underline} because, after all,
what are we? We're conscious. We're robots made of robots made of
robots. We're actual. In principle, you could make us out of other
materials. Some of your best friends in the future could be robots.
[Possible in principle, absolutely no secret ingredients, but we're not
going to see it. **[We're not going to see it for various
reasons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One is, if you want a conscious agent,
we've got plenty of them around and they're quite wonderful, whereas the
ones that we would make would be not so wonderful.

# DEMOCRACY GOOD

### 2ac -- TL 

#### Democracy solves extinction.

**Twining 21**, PhD, president of the International Republican
Institute, former director of the Asia Program at the German Marshall
Fund. (Daniel, 10-10-2021, \"America must double down on democracy\",
*The Hill*,

\*language edited

The hard truth is that [a world that is **less free** is one that is
**less**]{.underline} secure, **[stable]{.underline}** and prosperous.
[The **greatest dangers** to the American way of life emanate from
**hostile autocracies**]{.underline}. There are no quick fixes, but
[[the **best antidotes** to]{.underline}]{.mark} the challenges of
[**[great-power conflict]{.mark}**, **[terrori]{.mark}sm** [and **mass
migration**]{.mark}]{.underline} of desperate refugees [[lie
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[building]{.underline}** of inclusive
**[[democratic institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- and working with
allied democracies to sustain the free and open order that China, in
particular, wishes to replace with a world that's safe for autocracy.
The conventional wisdom that authoritarianism has popular momentum is
wrong. No one anywhere is taking to the street to demand more corrupt
governance, the adoption of one-man rule, a stronger surveillance state,
or greater intervention by malign foreign powers. [Democratic freedoms
are]{.underline} unquestionably [under assault in many
nations]{.underline}. Autocrats are aggressive precisely because of the
growing demands for change in their more modern, connected societies ---
and the rising risk that middle classes in nations such as China and
Russia will not be willing forever to forfeit political rights for
prosperity. [[American]{.underline}]{.mark} retrenchment and
[[isolationism **compound the danger**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It would be
nice to live in a world where failed states and dictatorships were a
problem for someone else to worry about. But rather than producing
stability, [[Western retreat]{.underline}]{.mark} only [**[emboldens
autocrats]{.mark}** in ways that **amplify dangers** to American
national security.]{.underline} We know that [violent [extremism
**flourishes** under]{.mark}]{.underline} state failure and
**[[dictatorship]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Broken states become breeding
grounds for extremist groups because they leave vacuums that terrorists
are only too happy to fill. [In nations without **democratic
accountability**, citizens become drawn to the only forms of expression
available to them, which are often **violent** and
**extreme**.]{.underline} The good news is that we have billions of
allies around the world: citizens on every continent chafing for greater
freedom and dignity. They do not want U.S. military-led nation-building.
They want peaceful support for their independent efforts to create
democratic space in systems distorted by overweening government control,
dangerous governance gaps and foreign malign influence. [The free world
**cannot be neutral** in the face of **autocracy's
resurgence**]{.underline}. Rather, it should play to its strengths. The
appeal of democratic opportunity is a strategic asset for the United
States --- despite our own shortcomings --- because people around the
world similarly aspire to live in societies that guarantee justice,
rights and dignity. [America's **closest allies are democracies**.
[Democracies **don't fight each other**, **export**]{.mark} **violent
[extremism]{.mark}**, [or **produce**]{.mark} **the [conflicts]{.mark}**
that drive **mass migration**]{.underline}. [[Democracies are **better

[[**trafficking** and]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[poverty]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[as well as establishing]{.mark}

societies **incubate the tech**]{.mark}nologies [that will]{.mark} help
**[solve]{.mark}** the world's **most pressing problems**, including

### XT: War

#### Decline triggers global war [quickly]{.underline}

**Diamond 19**, PhD in Sociology, professor of Sociology and Political
Science at Stanford University (Larry, "Ill Winds: Saving Democracy from
Russian Rage, Chinese Ambition and American Complacency," Kindle
Edition)

In such a near future, my fellow experts would no longer talk of
"democratic erosion." We would be spiraling downward into a time of
democratic despair, recalling Daniel Patrick Moynihan's grim observation
from the 1970s that liberal democracy "is where the world was, not where
it is going." 5 The world pulled out of that downward spiral---but it
took new, more purposeful American leadership. [The planet was not so
lucky in the 1930s, when [the]{.mark} global [implosion of democracy led
to a **catastrophic world war**]{.mark}, between a rising axis of
emboldened dictatorships and a shaken and economically depressed
collection of self-doubting democracies]{.underline}. [These are the
stakes]{.underline}. [Expanding [democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}---with
its liberal norms and constitutional commitments---[[is]{.mark} a
**[crucial]{.mark} foundation** [for **world peace**]{.mark} **and
security**]{.underline}. [Knock that away, and our most basic hopes and
assumptions will be imperiled]{.underline}. The problem is not just that
the ground is slipping. It is that [[we are **perched on a global
precipice**]{.underline}]{.mark}. That ledge has been gradually giving
way for a decade. [[If the erosion continues, we
may]{.underline}]{.mark} well [[reach a **tipping point** where
democracy **goes bankrupt suddenly**]{.mark}---[plunging the world
into]{.mark} depths of oppression and [aggression]{.mark} that [we have
not seen since]{.mark}]{.underline} the end of [[World War
II]{.underline}]{.mark}. As a political scientist, I know that our
theories and tools are not nearly good enough to tell us just how close
we are getting to that point---until it happens.

#### Democratic backsliding leads to [nuke war]{.underline} and [threat-multiplication]{.underline}

**Kendall-Taylor 19**, Senior Fellow and Director of the Transatlantic
Security Program at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS)
(Andrea, February 26^th^, "Autocracy's Advance and Democracy's Decline:
National Security Implications of the Rise of Authoritarianism Around
the World",
<https://www.cnas.org/publications/congressional-testimony/testimony-before-the-house-permanent-select-committee-on-intelligence-1>,
accessed 7/21/19)

The growing prevalence of personalized
[[autocracies]{.underline}]{.mark} is cause for concern because they
tend to [produce the worst outcomes of any type of political regime:
they tend to [produce the most risky and aggressive]{.mark} foreign
[policies]{.mark}; the [most]{.mark} [likely to invest in nuclear
weapon]{.mark}s]{.underline};7 [the **[most likely to fight
wars]{.mark}**]{.underline} [against democracies]{.underline};8
[[and]{.mark} the **most likely to [initiate]{.mark} interstate
[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}.9 [As the **adventurism**]{.underline}
[of Iraq's Saddam Hussein, Uganda's Idi Amin, and North Korea's Kim
Jong-un suggests, a **[lack of accountability]{.mark} often [translates
into]{.mark} an ability to take [risks]{.mark}** that other dictatorial
systems simply cannot afford]{.underline}.

[[Russia underscores the link between rising personalism and
**aggression**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Although Putin's actions in Crimea
and Syria were designed to advance a number of key Russian goals, it is
also likely that Putin's lack of domestic constraints increased the
level of risk he was willing to accept in pursuit of those
goals]{.underline}. Putin's tight control over the media ensures that
the public receives only the official narrative of foreign events.
Limited access to outside information makes it difficult for Russians to
access unbiased accounts of the goings-on in the rest of the world and
gauge Putin's success in the foreign policy arena. Putin's elimination
of competing voices within his regime further ensures that he faces
minimal accountability for his foreign policy actions.

[Politics in **China** show many of these same trends. Xi's
**increasingly aggressive posture in the South China Sea**]{.underline}
[has occurred alongside the rising personalization of the political
system. Xi has amassed substantial personal power since coming to office
in 2012 and continues to roll back the norms of the post-Mao collective
leadership system. [If Xi further consolidates]{.mark} control and
limits accountability---particularly over military and foreign policy
bodies---research suggests that [he]{.mark}, too, [could]{.mark} feel
free to **further [escalate]{.mark} his aggressive rhetoric and actions
[in the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea**]{.underline}.

[Not only do personalist dictatorships pursue aggressive foreign
policies---they are also often **difficult and unpredictable
partners**]{.underline}. [Research underscores that, thanks to [limited
constraints]{.mark} on decisionmaking, personalist leaders generally
[have]{.mark} the **latitude to [change their minds on a

The [proposition]{.underline} that [democratic states do not fight
interstate wars against each other is]{.underline} [one of the most
enduring and influential ideas in international relations.]{.underline}
The idea is theoretically rooted in the work of Immanuel Kant, who
argued that interactions between states with a republican form of
government give "a favorable prospect for the desired consequence, i.e.,
perpetual peace."Footnote1 This has led to a large literature
empirically documenting a negative association between democracy and
conflict,Footnote2 leading one scholar to comment that the [democratic
peace is "**the closest thing we have to an empirical law** in the study
of international relations]{.underline}."Footnote3

Despite the law-like nature of this association, [no scholarly consensus
has emerged]{.underline} on [whether the observed association reflects a
causal relationship or a spurious correlation.]{.underline} According to
a recent survey, [more than 30 percent of international relations
scholars disagree with the democratic peace
theory]{.underline}.Footnote4 In particular, skeptics have challenged
the democratic peace by arguing that alliance structures from the Cold
War,Footnote5 capitalism,Footnote6 and contract-intensive
economiesFootnote7 confound the observed association. These authors find
that adding certain confounding variables to regression models
eliminates the statistical significance of the estimated coefficient for
the joint democracy variable.Footnote8

How should we resolve this empirical debate regarding the democratic
peace?Footnote9 Unfortunately, in the absence of randomized experiments,
we can never completely rule out the possible existence of confounding
biases that arise from omitted variables. While scholars in this
literature have exclusively relied on parametric regression models, this
approach requires strong assumptions, namely that the model accurately
characterizes the true data-generating process (correct set of
variables, right functional form, valid distributional assumption,
etc.). Given that these assumptions may not be verifiable from observed
data, it is no surprise that various scholars advocate different
regression models with diverging sets of variables, resulting in
contradictory findings. The [difficulty]{.underline} of [adjudicating
between these alternative modeling approaches]{.underline} has [led to
the ongoing controversy in the empirical democratic peace
literature.]{.underline}

We propose an alternative approach based on nonparametric sensitivity
analysis to formally assess the robustness of the empirical
evidence.Footnote10 Specifically, we quantify the strength of
confounding relationships that could explain away the observed
association between democracy and peace. That is, we compute the precise
level of unobserved confounding needed to render the observed
association between democracy and conflict spurious. The idea is that
although not all correlations imply causation, a very strong correlation
suggests it. Unlike the parametric regression modeling approach
prevalent in the literature, the proposed nonparametric sensitivity
approach directly addresses the existence of unobserved confounders
without assuming a particular regression model.Footnote11 Although one
can never know with certainty from observational data whether democracy
causes peace, this [nonparametric sensitivity]{.underline} analysis can
[formally assess the robustness of empirical evidence for the democratic
peace.]{.underline}

Our analysis applies the nonparametric sensitivity analysis method
originally developed by Cornfield and colleagues, who were concerned
with the robustness of the positive association between cigarette
smoking and lung cancer in the potential presence of unobserved
confounders.Footnote12 [The study of the causal relationship between
smoking and lung cancer closely parallels the dispute on the democratic
peace]{.underline}. In both cases, randomized experiments cannot be
conducted for ethical and logistical reasons, and critics contend that
the observed association suffers from confounding biases. While no
definitive conclusion can be drawn from observational data, Cornfield
and colleagues argue that no existing confounder can explain the strong
association between smoking and cancer and therefore this relationship
is likely to be causal. Their conclusion is worth quoting here:

Cigarette smokers have a ninefold greater risk of developing lung cancer
than nonsmokers, while over-two-pack-a-day smokers have at least a
60-fold greater risk. Any characteristic proposed as a measure of the
postulated cause common to both smoking status and lung-cancer risk must
therefore be at least nine-fold more prevalent among cigarette smokers
than among nonsmokers and at least 60-fold more prevalent among
two-pack-a-day smokers. No such characteristic has yet been produced
despite diligent search.Footnote13

Our [application of nonparametric sensitivity analysis]{.underline} to
the [democratic peace yields]{.underline} **[striking
results]{.underline}**. Depending on the definition of democracy, we
find that [a confounder must be at]{.underline} least **[forty-seven
times more prevalent in democratic dyads]{.underline}** than in other
types of dyads. Thus, [any potential confounder that could explain the
democratic peace would have to be at **least five times as prevalent as
a similar confounder for smoking and lung cancer.**]{.underline} In
other words, according to our analysis, [the positive association
between democracy and peace is **much more robust than that between
smoking and lung cancer.**]{.underline}

While no such confounder has yet been found for the relationship between
smoking and lung cancer, we examine whether the confounders identified
in the democratic peace literature meet the conditions of nonparametric
sensitivity analysis. For example, we consider a set of economic
confounders proposed by Gartzke who argues that the democratic peace can
be explained by capitalism.Footnote14 We also consider other
confounders, such as military alliances.Footnote15 Overall, our
find[ings imply that for a potential confounder to explain away the
democratic peace]{.underline}, [it must be much more strongly associated
with regime types and conflicts **than the confounders that have been
proposed to date.**]{.underline} This finding again [demonstrates the
robustness of empirical evidence for the **democratic
peace**.]{.underline}

#### Democratic spread puts a [cap on conflict]{.underline}, and authoritarianism makes all of their impacts more likely

**Diamond 19** -- PhD in Sociology, professor of Sociology and Political
Science at Stanford University (Larry, "Ill Winds: Saving Democracy from
Russian Rage, Chinese Ambition and American Complacency," Kindle
Edition)

To make our republics more perfect, established democracies must not
only adopt reforms to more fully include and empower their own citizens.
They must also support people, groups, and institutions struggling to
achieve democratic values elsewhere. The best way to counter Russian
rage and Chinese ambition is to show that Moscow and Beijing are on the
wrong side of history; that people everywhere yearn to be free; and that
they can make freedom work to achieve a more just, sustainable, and
prosperous society. In our networked age, both idealism and the harder
imperatives of global power and security argue for more democracy, not
less. For one thing, if we do not worry about the quality of governance
in lower-income countries, we will face more and more troubled and
failing states. [[Famine and genocide are the curse of]{.mark}
[authoritarian states]{.mark}, not democratic ones]{.underline}.
Outright state collapse is the ultimate, bitter fruit of tyranny. When
countries like Syria, Libya, and Afghanistan descend into civil war;
when poor states in Africa cannot generate jobs and improve their
citizens' lives due to rule by corrupt and callous strongmen; when
Central American societies are held hostage by brutal gangs and
kleptocratic rulers, people flee---and wash up on the shores of the
democracies. Europe and the United States cannot withstand the rising
pressures of immigration unless they work to support better, more stable
and accountable government in troubled countries. [The world has simply
grown too small, too flat, and too fast to wall off rotten states and
pretend they are on some other planet]{.underline}. **[[Hard security
interests are at stake.]{.underline}]{.mark}** As even the Trump
administration's 2017 National Security Strategy makes clear, [the [main
threats]{.mark} to U.S. national security all [stem from
authoritarianism]{.mark}]{.underline}, [whether in the form of
tyrannies]{.underline} from Russia and China to Iran and North Korea [or
in the guise of antidemocratic terrorist movements such as
ISIS]{.underline}. 1 [By supporting]{.underline} the development of
[democracy around the world, we]{.underline} can [deny these
authoritarian adversaries the geopolitical running room they
seek]{.underline}. Just as Russia, China, and Iran are trying to
undermine democracies to bend other countries to their will, so too can
[we contain]{.underline} these [autocrats']{.underline} [ambitions by
helping other countries build effective, resilient
democracies]{.underline} that can withstand the dictators' malevolence.
Of course, democratically elected governments with open societies will
not support the American line on every issue. But no free society wants
to mortgage its future to another country. The American [national
interest would best be secured by a pluralistic world of free
countries]{.underline}---[one in which autocrats can no longer use
corruption and coercion to gobble up resources, alliances, and
territory]{.underline}. [If you look back over our history to see who
has posed a [threat]{.mark}]{.underline} to the United States and our
allies, [it [has **always** been authoritarian regimes and
empires]{.mark}]{.underline}. As political scientists have long noted,
**[[no two democracies have ever gone to war with each
other---ever]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[It is
**not**]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[democracies]{.mark}** of the world
[that are supporting international terrorism, proliferating]{.mark}
weapons of mass destruction, [or threatening]{.mark} the
[territory]{.mark} of their neighbors]{.underline}.

4\. Results

[We estimated two sets of models for all pairs of states for every year
over the 1900--2010 period with the democratic peace hypothesis
represented as the democracy score(s) of the stronger
country]{.underline}, that of the weaker country, the interaction of
these two, and several control variables. In the first set of models, we
entered the five indicators of constraint one by one along with our
control variables. Figure 3 summarizes the results from these models.
Complete estimation results in table form with all control variables are
found in Appendix Table A-1.

The first model (called 'Electoral accountability') enters the three
terms based on the electoral accountability index along with control
variables. The estimates from this model are printed in green color at
the top of the figure. [The points represent the estimates and the
whiskers their estimated **95% confidence interval**]{.underline}. [The
two main terms are both positive]{.underline}, although that for the
weaker country is not statistically significant. The interaction between
the index values for the two countries in the dyad, on the other hand,
is negative and highly significant -- [[when both countries score highly
in]{.mark} terms of [electoral accountability]{.mark}, the **[risk of
fatal dispute is much lower]{.mark}** than if either have low
scores]{.underline}. In line with expectations, we show in Appendix
Table A-3 that the effect of electoral democracy is driven by the
"Schumpeterian" core dimensions tapping into contestation -- whereas
suffrage does not play an independent role in promoting peace.

[The second model enters the 'Legislative constraints' index terms.
Again, the interaction term is negative and significant, whereas the
main terms are positive and significant. Similar patterns are observed
for the other three individual indicators]{.underline}.

[Figure 4 shows that [the net effect]{.mark} for each of these
indicators [is **consistent with the democratic
peace**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In the left panels, the dashed line plots
the estimated log odds of a MID when the weaker country j is at the mean
of the index, as a function of the score for the stronger country (along
the x-axis)]{.underline}. The metric for the y-axis is log odds relative
to the case where both countries have scores of 0 for the index. The
dotted and solid lines show the same when the index is one standard
deviation below or above the mean.19

[The graph on the right plots the marginal effect of this relationship
-- it shows the change in the estimated probability of a fatal
dispute]{.underline} when comparing a pair of countries where the weaker
country has a value for the index one standard deviation below the mean
and one standard 22 deviation above, respectively, as a function of the
index for the stronger country[. Both [these graphs show a **clear
dyadic**]{.mark} **[democratic peace in terms of all our indices of
constraint]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [[a more democratic weaker country
means]{.mark} a **clearly [lower risk of fatal MID if the stronger
country is relatively democratic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.20

[All of our individual [indicators of constraint **reflect**]{.mark}
**the [democratic peace]{.mark} when entered on their
own**]{.underline}. [[Given the **high correlation**]{.mark} between
them, however, each of them may serve as a proxy for one of the
other]{.underline}. We investigate which of them are relatively most
important along two routes.

5\. Conclusion

In this article we have introduced two novelties into the study of the
democratic peace. First, [we make use of the V-Dem data and demonstrate
that it improves on Polity, the dominant measure in that literature,
along at least two dimensions.]{.underline} First, [[V-Dem has
a]{.underline} **[superior]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[concept-to
measurement [consistency]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [given its starting
point]{.underline}]{.mark} [was the overt modeling of
democracy]{.underline}. Moreover, [the [V-Dem data are **vastly more
detailed**]{.mark}]{.underline} [than Polity, [allowing us to
operationalize]{.mark} much more [precise theoretical mechanisms]{.mark}
than the simpler datasets]{.underline}. Accordingly, our fit tests show
that our [[V-Dem-based indices **model**]{.mark} **the [democratic
peace]{.mark}**]{.underline} [much [better]{.mark} than
Polity]{.underline}, both in terms of in-sample goodness of fit and
out-of-sample predictive performance.

Second, and more importantly, we have identified a subset of the
multiplicity of democracy's attributes that seem to explain its ability
to deter war-like behavior. [Specifically we show that, [when entered
**individually**]{.mark}, electoral [accountability]{.mark}, judicial
and legislative [constraints]{.mark} on the executive, media [freedom
and]{.mark} civil society [participation **promote**]{.mark} **the
dem[ocratic pe]{.mark}ace**]{.underline}, when controlling for the other
standard determinants of inter-state disputes. When pitted against each
28 other, however, only [horizontal **constraints on the executive** and
civil society participation continue to have a direct effect on dyadic
peace]{.underline}. [We thus find most consistent support for the
horizontal and informal-vertical accountability mechanisms underlying
the democratic peace]{.underline}. Earlier we cited the claim of Maoz
and Russett (1993, 626) that '[the mobilization of ... general public
opinion' matters at the same order of importance as the 'variety of
institutions that make up the system of government']{.underline}. Our
findings provide support for the institutional side of their claims but
to some extent contradict what they say about social mobilization. We
confirm important aspects of earlier work on the democratic peace such
as Doyle's (1983a,b) 'liberal peace' argument and Choi's (2010) focus on
legislative veto players. However[, our results on the role of civil
society suggest that **social mobilization** is also
important]{.underline}. The exclusion of the peace-making role of civil
society in this literature may well be a function of the past paucity of
data to measure it. [[Given the strong model fit and]{.mark} predictive
[performance of the models that include]{.mark} this new [V-Dem
variable, this omission has been an important oversight in the
literature]{.mark} from the perspective of our constraint-based
theorization of the mechanisms behind the democratic peace]{.underline}.

### 2ac -- Terrorism

#### Democracy solves terrorism\-\--the data *[overwhelmingly goes our way]{.underline}*.

Program at the Lauder School of Government, Diplomacy, and Strategy of
the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) in Herzliya, Israel. He is also a
senior researcher at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism

Democracy Volume 29, Issue 1, Pages 111-125;
<https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/fighting-terrorism-the-democracy-advantage/>;
accessed 7/22/19)

The scourge of terrorism is real, yet summary data tell us little about
the distribution of attacks or the rates of increase in terrorist
incidents across various regime types. [In reality, [the **disparity**
in the internal distribution]{.mark} \[End Page 115\] [of terrorism
incidents]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[across regime types is already
immense and seems to be getting wider]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

[A number of insights can be gleaned from the aggregate trends. Contrary
to the traditional view, [we observe a **robust and growing "double
democracy advantage**]{.mark}**"**]{.underline} [among liberal
democracies and polyarchies over the 2002--16 period, and especially
since 2007]{.underline}. [N[ot only are]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[higher-quality democracies less prone to terrorist
attacks]{.underline}**]{.mark} [than all other regime types, [but the
**rate of increase**]{.mark} [in the number of attacks among such
democracies is **substantially lower**]{.mark} in comparison to the
rest]{.underline}.

The pattern is maintained even where we exclude any country that is
farther than two standard deviations from the subcategory mean, namely
the United Kingdom among liberal democracies, and Israel among the
polyarchies. [This is all the more striking given the already relatively
low levels of terrorist incidents experienced by liberal democracies and
polyarchies at the start of the measurement period. It lends support to
the minority view in the literature that sees **[political
openness]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and the protection of civil
liberties]{.mark} and the rule of law as assets that
**[facilitate]{.mark} the [minimization of
terrorism]{.mark}**]{.underline} [through the airing and redress of
grievances; the wide scope granted to peaceful political expression; and
the resulting lower legitimacy accorded to violent fringe
groups]{.underline}.

#### Terrorism goes nuclear.

Arguello previously worked on nuclear projects for the Argentine
National Atomic Energy Commission. (Irma, "The global impacts of a
terrorist nuclear attack: What would happen? What should we do?",
*Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists*)

Though hard to accept, [the detonation of a **nuclear
device**]{.underline} -- [by]{.underline} states or **[non-state
actors]{.underline}** -- [is]{.underline} today a
**[plausible]{.underline}** scenario. And while much of the world's
focus has been on the current nuclear weapons arsenals possessed by
states -- about 14,550 warheads, all of which carry the risk of
intentional or unintentional use -- [[the **threat of
nuc**]{.mark}**lear [terrorism]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} **here** and
**[increasing]{.mark}**. For more than a decade, **Al Qaeda**, Aum
Shinrikyo, and other **[terrorist groups]{.mark}** have
[expressed]{.mark} their [desire to **acquire fissile
material**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to **build** and **detonate**
a]{.underline}]{.mark}n improvised **[[nuc]{.mark}lear
bomb]{.underline}**. [None of them could fulfill that goal]{.underline}
-- so far. [But that does not mean that they **will not succeed in the
future**.]{.underline} Making matters worse, there is evidence of an
illicit market for nuclear weapons-usable materials. There are sellers
in search of potential buyers, as shown by the dismantlement of a
nuclear smuggling network in Moldova in 2015. There certainly are plenty
of sites from which to obtain nuclear material. According to the 2016
Nuclear Security Index by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, 24 countries
still host inventories of nuclear weapons-usable materials, stored in
facilities with different degrees of security. And in terms of risk, it
is not necessary for a given country to possess nuclear weapons,
weapons-usable materials, or nuclear facilities for it to be useful to
nuclear terrorists: Structural and institutional weaknesses in a country
may make it favorable for the illicit trade of materials. Permeable
boundaries, high levels of corruption, weaknesses in judicial systems,
and consequent impunity may give rise to a series of transactions and
other events, which could end in a nuclear attack. The truth is that, at
this stage, no country in possession of nuclear weapons or
weapons-usable materials can guarantee their full protection against
nuclear terrorism or nuclear smuggling. Because we live in a world of
growing insecurity, where explicit and tacit agreements between the
relevant powers -- which upheld global stability during the post-Cold
War -- are giving way to increasing mistrust and hostility, a question
arises: How would our lives be affected if a current terrorist group
such as the Islamic State (ISIS), or new terrorist groups in the future,
succeed in evolving from today's Manchester style "low-tech" attacks to
a "high-tech" one, involving a nuclear bomb, detonated in a capital
city, anywhere in the world? We attempted to answer this question in a
report developed by a high-level multidisciplinary expert group convened
by the NPSGlobal Foundation for the Latin American and Caribbean
Leadership Network. We found that there would be multiple harmful
effects that would spread promptly around the globe (Arguello and Buis
2016); a more detailed analysis is below, which highlights the need for
the creation of a comprehensive nuclear security system. The
consequences of a terrorist nuclear attack A small and primitive
1-kiloton fission bomb (with a yield of about one-fifteenth of the one
dropped on Hiroshima, and certainly much less sophisticated; cf. Figure
1), detonated in any large capital city of the developed world, would
cause an unprecedented catastrophic scenario. An estimate of direct
effects in the attack's location includes a death toll of
7,300-to-23,000 people and 12,600-to-57,000 people injured, depending on
the target's geography and population density. Total physical
destruction of the city's infrastructure, due to the blast (shock wave)
and thermal radiation, would cover a radius of about 500 meters from the
point of detonation (also known as ground zero), while ionizing
radiation greater than 5 Sieverts -- compatible with the deadly acute
radiation syndrome -- would expand within an 850-meter radius. From the
environmental point of view, such an area would be unusable for years.
In addition, radioactive fallout would expand in an area of about 300
square kilometers, depending on meteorological conditions (cf. Figure
2). But the consequences would go far beyond the effects in the target
country, however, and promptly propagate worldwide. Global and national
security, economy and finance, international governance and its
framework, national political systems, and the behavior of governments
and individuals would all be [put under severe trial.]{.underline} The
severity of the effects at a national level, however, would depend on
the countries' level of development, geopolitical location, and
resilience. **[Global security]{.underline}** and regional/national
defense schemes [would be **strongly affected**. [An **increase in
global distrust** would **spark rising tensions**]{.mark} among
countries [and]{.mark}]{.underline} blocs, that could even [[lead
to]{.mark} the **brink of [nuclear]{.mark} weapons [use]{.mark}** by
states]{.underline} ([if, for instance, a **sponsor country** is
identified]{.underline}). [The [consequences]{.mark} of such a shocking
scenario would [include]{.mark} a **decrease** in states'
**self-control**, [an **escalation of**]{.mark} **present
[conflicts]{.mark}** [and the **emergence of new ones**]{.mark},
accompanied by an **increase in military unilateralism**]{.underline}
and military expenditures.

### I/L Terrorism 

#### Democracy prevents state collapse -- failed states are a prerequisite to organized terror

**Abrams 16** -- Former assistant secretary of state for human rights
and humanitarian affairs (Elliott, lead author on a foreign policy essay
written along with 145 other influential ambassadors, former members of
Congress, NED and UNCHR staff, etc.,"U.S. Must Put Democracy at the
Center of its Foreign Policy," *Foreign Policy*,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/16/the-u-s-must-put-democracy-at-the-center-of-its-foreign-policy/)

The United States is founded on the principles of life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness, and for decades, support for democracy and human
rights around the world has been a central tenet of American foreign
policy. While the United States must maintain relations with many
autocratic governments abroad, there are excellent reasons why most of
our closest allies are [[democracies]{.underline}]{.mark}. Free nations
[are more economically successful, more stable, and more reliable
partners for the United States]{.underline}. [Democratic societies are
less likely to launch aggression and war]{.underline} against their
neighbors or their own people. [They [are]{.mark} also [less likely to
experience state failure and become breeding grounds
for]{.mark}]{.underline} instability and
[[terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}, as we have seen, for example, in
Syria. This means that the advance of [democracy]{.underline} serves
U.S. interests and [[contributes to order and peace around the
globe]{.underline}]{.mark}. [During the past four decades, the number of
countries that are free and democratic has more than
doubled]{.underline}. From Latin America and Central Europe to East Asia
and sub-Saharan Africa, people have opted for accountable government.
This remarkable progress is rooted in the universal longing for liberty
and dignity --- but it is also [due to America's strong support
for]{.underline} human rights and [democracy]{.underline}, under
administrations of both parties. This support has been not only a means
of expressing the values upon which our nation was founded, but also a
pragmatic choice to promote the governing system that advances security,
provides stable markets, and protects human rights. We write to urge you
to embrace this cause and to make it a central part of your foreign
policy platform. In recent years, authoritarian regimes such as Russia
and China have become more repressive; they see the advance of democracy
not only within their borders but in neighboring states as a threat to
their monopoly on political power. A regime's treatment of its own
people often indicates how it will behave toward its neighbors and
beyond. Thus, we should not be surprised that so many of the political,
economic and security challenges we face emanate from places like
Moscow, Beijing, Pyongyang, Tehran, and Damascus. [[Repressive regimes
are inherently unstable]{.underline}]{.mark} and must rely on
suppressing democratic movements and civil society to stay in power.
[They]{.underline} also [are]{.underline} the source and exporter of
massive corruption, [a [pervasive transnational danger to stable
democratic governanc]{.mark}e throughout the world]{.underline}. The
result is that [democracy is under attack]{.underline}. According to
Freedom House, freedom around the world has declined every year for the
past decade. [That heightens the imperative for the United States
to]{.underline} work with fellow democracies to [reinvigorate support
for democratic reformers]{.underline} everywhere. Supporting freedom
around the world does not mean imposing American values or staging
military interventions. In non-democratic countries, it means peacefully
and creatively aiding local activists who seek democratic reform and
look to the United States for moral, political, diplomatic, and
sometimes material support. These activists often risk prison, torture,
and death struggling for a more democratic society, and their resilience
and courage amid such threats demand our support. Helping them upholds
the principles upon which our country was founded. Supporting democracy
involves partnerships between the U.S. government and non-governmental
organizations that are struggling to bring freedom to their countries.
Often, it means partnering as well with emerging democracies to
strengthen their representative and judicial institutions. This requires
resources that Congress must continue to provide, and foreign assistance
must be linked to positive performance with regard to human rights and
the advancement of fundamental freedoms. It also requires diplomatic
backing at the highest levels of the Executive Branch, throughout the
different agencies of government, and from the Congress as well. It
means meeting with democratic activists from various parts of the world
and speaking out on their behalf. Demonstrating solidarity with and
support for these brave individuals' efforts to build a better future
for their country is the right thing to do. In aiding their struggles
for freedom and justice, we build a more secure world for the United
States. There is no cookie-cutter approach to supporting democracy and
human rights, but there are fundamental, universal features we should
emphasize: representative institutions, rule of law, accountability,
free elections, anti-corruption, free media (including the Internet),
vibrant civil society, independent trade unions, property rights, open
markets, women's and minority rights, and freedoms of expression,
assembly, association, and religion. Many Americans question why the
United States should have to shoulder the burdens of supporting freedom
and democracy throughout the world. But a growing number of democracies
in Europe and Asia, as well as international organizations, are
expending significant resources to lend this kind of assistance. We
should continue to build on our partnerships with like-minded
organizations and countries, including relatively new democracies that
are eager to help others striving for freedom. Some argue that we can
pursue either our democratic ideals or our national security, but not
both. This is a false choice. We recognize that we have other interests
in the economic, energy, and security realms with other countries and
that [[democracy]{.underline}]{.mark} and human rights cannot be the
only items on the foreign policy agenda. But all too often, these
[[issues get shortchanged]{.mark} or dropped entirely in order [to
smooth bilateral relationships]{.mark} in the short run]{.underline}.
The instability that has characterized the Middle East for decades is
the direct result of generations of authoritarian repression, the lack
of accountable government, and the repression of civil society, not the
demands that we witnessed during the Arab Spring of 2011 and since for
dignity and respect for basic human rights. In the longer run, we pay
the price in instability and conflict when corrupt, autocratic regimes
collapse. Our request is that you elevate democracy and human rights to
a prominent place on your foreign policy agenda. These are challenging
times for freedom in many respects, as countries struggle to make
democracy work and powerful autocracies brutalize their own citizens
while undermining their neighbors. But these [autocracies
are]{.underline} also [vulnerable]{.underline}. Around the world,
ordinary people continue to show their preference for participatory
democracy and accountable government. Thus, [[there is real potential to
renew global democratic progress]{.underline}]{.mark}. [For that to
happen, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates **[must exercise
leadership]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in league with our democratic allies,
to support homegrown efforts to make societies freer and governments
more democratic. We ask you to commit to providing that leadership and
to embracing the cause of democracy and human rights if elected
president of the United States.

### ! Terrorism 

#### Terrorism causes [nuclear war]{.underline}\-\--lash out ensures escalation

**Hayes '18** \[Peter; January 18th; *Non-State Terrorism and
Inadvertent Nuclear War*;
<https://nautilus.org/napsnet/napsnet-special-reports/non-state-terrorism-and-inadvertent-nuclear-war/>;
accessed 11/16/18//MSCOTT\]

[Conclusion]{.underline}

We now move to our conclusion. [Nuclear-armed states can place
themselves on the edge of nuclear war]{.underline} by a combination of
threatening force deployments and threat rhetoric. [Statements by US and
North Korea's leaders]{.underline} and supporting amplification by state
and private media to present just such a lethal combination. Many
[observers have observed that the risk of war and nuclear
war]{.underline}, in Korea and globally, [have increased in the last few
years]{.underline}---although no-one can say with authority by how much
and exactly for what reasons. However, **[[states are
restrained]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[in]{.mark} their [actual decisions
to escalate to conflict]{.mark} and/or nuclear war by conventional
deterrence, vital national interests, and other institutional and
political restraints]{.underline}, both domestic and international. It
is not easy, in the real world, or even in fiction, to start nuclear
wars.\[19\] Rhetorical threats are standard fare in realist and
constructivist accounts of inter-state nuclear deterrence, compellence,
and reassurance, and are not cause for alarm per se. States will manage
the risk in each of the threat relationships with other nuclear armed
states to stay back from the brink, let alone go over it, as they have
in the past. This argument was powerful and to many, persuasive during
the Cold War although it does not deny the hair-raising risks taken by
nuclear armed states during this period. Today, [the multi-polarity of
nine nuclear weapons states interacting in a four-tiered nuclear threat
system means that the practice of sustaining nuclear threat and
preparing for nuclear war is no longer merely complicated, but is now
enormously complex]{.underline} in ways that may exceed the capacity of
some and perhaps all states to manage, even without the emergence of a
fifth tier of non-state actors to add further unpredictability to how
this system works in practice. [The possibility that **[non-state actors
may attack]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[without advance warning]{.mark} as
to the time, place, and angle of attack presents another **layer of
uncertainty**]{.underline} [to this complexity as to how inter-state
nuclear war may break out]{.underline}. That is, **[non-state actors
[with nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** [or threat goals and
capacities do not seek the same goals]{.underline}, **[will not use the
same control systems]{.underline}**, [and will use radically different
organizational procedures and systems to deliver on their threats
compared with nuclear armed states]{.underline}. If **[used tactically
for immediate terrorist effect]{.underline}**, [a non-state nuclear
terrorist could **[violently attack nuclear
facilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[exploiting]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[any number of **[vulnerabilities]{.mark}** in fuel cycle facility
security, or **use actual nuclear materials**]{.underline} [and even
warheads against military or civilian targets]{.underline}. If a
persistent, strategically oriented **[nuclear terrorist]{.underline}**
succeed in gaining credible nuclear threat capacities, it [might take
hostage one or more states or cities]{.underline}. [If such an event
[**coincides** with]{.mark} already **[high levels of tension]{.mark}**
[and even military collisions between]{.mark} the non-nuclear forces of
[nuclear armed states]{.mark}, then [a **non-state nuclear terrorist
attack could impel a nuclear armed state to
escalate**]{.mark}]{.underline} [its threat or even **military
actions**]{.underline} [against other states, [in]{.mark} the
**[belief]{.mark} that [this targeted state may have sponsored
the]{.mark} non-state [attack]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [or was simply the
**source of the attack**]{.underline}, whatever the declared identity of
the attacking non-state entity. [[This]{.mark} outcome [could
trigger]{.mark} these states to go onto one or more of the pathways to
**[inadvertent nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [especially if the
terrorist attack was on a high value and high risk nuclear facility or
involved the seizure and/or use of fissile material]{.underline}. Some
experts dismiss this possibility as so remote as to be not worth
worrying about. [Yet the **history of nuclear terrorism**]{.underline}
[globally and in the Northeast Asian region suggests
otherwise]{.underline}. Using the sand castle metaphor, once built on
the high tide line, [sand castles may withstand the wind but eventually
succumb to the tide once it reaches the castle]{.underline}---at least
once, usually twice a day. Also, [[theories of organizational and
technological failure point to the **coincidence of
multiple**]{.underline}]{.mark}, relatively insignificant [**[driving
events]{.underline}**]{.mark} [that interact before accumulate in ways
that lead the "metasystem" to fail, even if each individual component of
a system works perfectly]{.underline}. Thus, the potential catalytic
effect of a nuclear terrorist incident is not that it would of itself
lead to a sudden inter-state nuclear war; but that at a time of crisis
when alert levels are already high, when control systems on nuclear
forces have already shifted from primary emphasis on negative to
positive control, when decision making is already stressed, when the
potential for miscalculation is already high due to shows of force
indicating that first-use is nigh, when rhetorical threats promising
annihilation on the one hand, or collapse of morale and weakness on the
other invite counter-vailing threats by nuclear adversaries or their
allies to gain the upper hand in the "contest of resolve," and when
organizational cybernetics may be in play such that purposeful actions
are implemented differently than intended, then [[a terrorist nuclear
attack]{.mark} [may]{.mark} shift a coincident combination of some or
all of these factors to a threshold level where they collectively
[**lead to a first-use decision** by one or more nuclear-armed
states]{.mark}]{.underline}. If the terrorist attack is timed or happens
to coincide with high levels of inter-state tension involving
nuclear-armed states, then some or all of these tendencies will likely
be in play anyway---precisely the concern of those who posit pathways to
inadvertent nuclear war as outlined in section 2 above.

### AT: Warming

#### Democracy is [key to solve warming]{.underline} --- authoritarian states aren't [empirically better]{.underline}, there is [no alternative]{.underline}, and uncaring public thesis is [wrong]{.underline}

Yet [[proposals for]{.underline}]{.mark} some sort of
[[eco-authoritarianism]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[raise more
questions]{.mark} than they answer]{.underline}**. [How]{.underline},
exactly, [do we move beyond democracy]{.underline}? **[Who appoints the
experts]{.underline}**? [Scientists may have evidence at their
disposa]{.underline}l, but **[how would they make deeply social
decisions about who wins and who loses]{.underline}**? Under whose
authority [would they regulate, and how exactly would that regulation
happen]{.underline} -- how would laws be made? The best that can be said
about these proposals is that [they [gloss over]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[complex realities of political]{.mark}, social and legal
[change]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

There's also the fact that [[authoritarian states **have not performed
better**]{.underline},]{.mark} [historically]{.underline}. A [**[recent
study]{.underline}** [by]{.underline}]{.mark} [the University of
Gothenburg's V-Dem Institute]{.underline} **[[showed]{.mark} that
[autocratic regimes lag significantly on climate
action]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Given the economic and political might
of China, we have to hope that they find a way to buck this
tre]{.underline}nd -- **[but [it]{.mark} would be reckless, not to
mention [ethically dubious]{.mark}, to [suggest China as a political
role model]{.mark} on climate]{.underline}**. [Despite]{.underline} the
considerable [flaws in our democratic systems]{.underline}, the
**[[alternatives crumble under]{.mark} [any]{.mark} sort of [close
inspection]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is hard to disagree with
Churchill's pithy summary that "democracy is the worst form of
government, except for all the others".

My experience leads me to a very different conclusion to that of the
eco-authoritarians. The [[data]{.underline}]{.mark} just **[[doesn't
suppor]{.mark}t the [picture of an uncaring or uninformed
public]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Research consistently shows]{.underline}
**[[high levels of concern]{.mark} about [climate
chang]{.mark}e]{.underline}**, across different ages, demographic groups
and parts of the world. Yet [this concern is coupled with a deep
mistrust in government and political elites,]{.underline} and a
breakdown in the means by which people's priorities are translated into
political action. To generalise, [we have a population that is cynical
yet concerned about the climate, frustrated with the inability of
politicians to act decisively]{.underline} in the face of growing
climate impacts.

Could it be that [the [problem here i]{.mark}s]{.underline} **[not too
much democracy, but [too little]{.mark}?]{.underline}** What if we were
to begin with the assumption that **[[people can]{.mark} and do [make
sensible decisions]{.mark} if they [have the evidence]{.mark} and the
[influence]{.mark} that they need]{.underline}**? That if we designed a
meaningful dialogue between citizens, experts and governments, we would
get better outcomes?

[What unites nearly]{.underline} **[all]{.underline}** of these
**[cases]{.underline}**? They are taking place in democracies.

The recent court rulings [tell us a l]{.underline}ot, not just
[about]{.underline} **[the powerful assets that democracy can
deploy]{.underline}** [in the struggle against climate
change]{.underline}, but also the **[long-term robustness of the case
for democracy as a political system.]{.underline}**

Democracies are under pressure from populism, disinformation, inequality
and voter frustration, according to the Global State of Democracy report
from the intergovernmental organisation International (IDEA). They are
also afflicted by a crisis of self-confidence.

Fairly or not, the current pandemic has helped cement a narrative
portraying liberal democracies as lumbering and too divided to cope with
big challenges, while extolling the presumed ability of authoritarian
systems to act decisively.

What are the vices to democracy?

This narrative is not concocted out of thin air. Democracies do suffer
from vices when it comes to slow-burning crises like global warming.

[Voters and politicians have short attention spans]{.underline}.
Balances of power mean reforms can be held hostage to obstinate US
Senators or oil lobbyists. [Science can play second fiddle to
vote]{.underline}rs if it entails higher taxes - France's yellow vest
protests, sparked by fuel price rises, are a case in point.

And [yet]{.underline}, **[despite all this]{.underline}**, the facts are
clear - **[9 out of the 10 top performers]{.underline}** in the 2021
Climate Change Performance Index **[are democracies.]{.underline}**

[Sweden tops the list]{.underline} of 57 countries. **[China is
30th.]{.underline}**

The reasons for this are not hard to fathom. [Democracies allow
for]{.underline} the **[free flow of information]{.underline}** [that
enables policy makers to **debate and find solutions**]{.underline},
[and for civil society to mobilis]{.underline}e. It is no coincidence
that youth campaigner Greta Thunberg helped spark a global movement from
a lone street demonstration in Sweden, one of the world's top performing
democracies.

[Democracies]{.underline} are **[more effective against climate
change]{.underline}** [for the same reasons that they don't experience
famines]{.underline}, as Nobel Laureate Indian economist Amartya Sen
suggested long ago - [because in allowing freedom of
expression]{.underline}, a vibrant civil society, [regular
elections]{.underline} and the workings of checks and balances, **[they
increase the likelihood that crises will be met]{.underline}** and
destructive policies corrected.

[Democracy is]{.underline} **[not simply elections]{.underline}** - it
is the often chaotic workings of myriad institutions and groups as well
as a culture of open debate, where [climate reform is nudged along by
**courts, free media, parliaments, and public protests**]{.underline}.
[Democracy's most powerful weapon]{.underline} against the challenges of
this century **[is its ability to self-correct.]{.underline}**

And then there is the capacity of democratic systems to forge the social
consensus required for long-term transformations to be sustainable. We
know this story - [participatory decision-making may be slower than
executive decrees]{.underline}, **[but almost always yields outcomes
that are more legitimate and accepted by society]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} hence **[more durable.]{.underline}**

[This is]{.underline} **[vital for climate change]{.underline}**.
[Decarbonisation is not something governments do by fiat,]{.underline}
though act they must - [it is something **societies as a whole must
do**]{.underline} by conviction. Consumer habits will need to change,
from reducing air travel to adjusting diets. Trillions of dollars will
have to be invested in transforming the sources of energy that fuel
economies

Although none of these burgeoning relationships has developed into a
highly unified partnership, democratic backsliding in these countries
has provided a basis for cooperation where it did not previously exist.
And while the United States certainly finds common cause with
authoritarian partners on specific issues, the depth and reliability of
such cooperation is limited. Consequently, [[further democratic decline
could seriously compromise the United States' ability to form]{.mark}
the kinds of [deep partnerships]{.mark} that will be required to
confront today's increasingly complex challenges]{.underline}. [[Global
issues such as **climate change**]{.mark},]{.underline} migration, and
violent extremism [[demand the coordination and cooperation that]{.mark}
democratic [backsliding]{.mark} would [put in

Yes, as Cortright says, [a great many [other countries are getting into
the drone game]{.mark} too]{.underline}---but [[this is less because the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is paving the way than because this
logic is obvious to those countries]{.mark} too]{.underline}. And [[this
same logic, combined with the reality that]{.mark} robotic [technologies
are getting cheaper and easier to acquire]{.mark} even as their power
increases, [means that **proliferation will happen irrespective** of
what the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [does.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Indeed, [the question is]{.underline} not whether we will live in a
world of highly proliferated technologies of robotic attack. It is
[whether the United States is going to be ahead of this curve or behind
it.]{.underline}

#### Claims that drone proliferation increases conflict are backwards -- drone strikes decrease the frequency and intensity of conflicts and are key to tactical flexibility.

Modern [drones]{.underline} provide many of the best features of both
cruise missiles and manned aircraft. Most significantly, they [provide
the tactical and operational flexibility of manned platforms with the
reduced risk to personnel associated with cruise missiles]{.underline}.
Unlike the former, they allow for man-in-the-loop control and vehicle
recovery. Unlike the latter, they can operate at altitudes and in
environments unsuited to manned systems and, in some cases, for extended
periods of time. [Despite the proliferation of drones, particularly by
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [at best it can be argued
that the proliferation of unmanned aerial systems]{.underline} (UASs)
[is changing tactics]{.underline}, particularly [with respect to
operations on land.]{.underline} The predominant mission of drones today
is to collect information, primarily electro-optical data in the form of
pictures and full motion video. The overwhelming majority of drone
flying hours are conducted by systems such as Aerovironment's Wasp,
Puma, and Raven; Insitu's ScanEagle; and Textron's Shadow for the
purpose of providing overwatch for maneuvering Army and Marine Corps
units. Even the vaunted Predator, a variant of which, the MQ-9 Reaper,
is the platform employed for armed strikes, is predominantly employed
for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. The larger
systems such as Northrop Grumman's Global Hawk and Lockheed Martin's
stealthy RQ-170 Sentinel are intended solely to gather intelligence.
[Armed drones serve a niche function. They are useful in situations
where real-time tactical intelligence is required in order to launch a
weapon and the operating environment is extremely benign. Because they
can loiter in the area of a suspected target, waiting for positive
identification and the proper time to strike with the least possibility
of inflicting collateral damage, they are far less lethal than any other
aerial weapons system. Attempts to connect an increased tendency to use
force are supported **neither by the evidence nor by logic. The
frequency and intensity of conflicts has declined even as the ability to
conduct remote combat has increased exponentially**]{.underline}. [There
were only a handful of drones available to the U.S. military when
Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom began. The lack of
unmanned systems appears to have posed no obstacle to the decision to
initiate either operation. It is difficult to accord any serious
influence over the conduct of air operations in past or current
conflicts to the presence of armed drones.]{.underline} In the era
before drones, the U.S. imposed ten year long no-fly zones over northern
and southern Iraq. In addition, [the number of drone sorties in total is
but a tiny fraction of all aerial sorties. Armed drone sorties
constitute only a small fraction of total drone missions.]{.underline}
Cortright notes that [since 2009 there have been 239 drone strikes into
Pakistan. However, for the month of January 2011, Coalition forces in
Afghanistan flew 387 sorties in which guns were fired or munitions
expended]{.underline}.\[2\] These statistics suggest a clear preference
on the part of the military for manned aerial systems and not drones in
the conduct of tactical air operations. [Cortright also reports that 145
drone strikes were conducted during]{.underline} Operation Odyssey
Dawn---[the liberation of Libya. Actually this is an incorrect
statement]{.underline}. While drones were used over Libya, these were
not armed flights, hence they were sorties and not strikes. But [this is
good example of the breathless quality of much of the analysis today of
the implications of drones for warfare]{.underline}. Look at the
numbers. The U.S. alone conducted some 3,500 sorties during Operation
Odyssey Dawn. So drones amounted to 4% of the total. By the way, the
United States and United Kingdom also launched 228 Tomahawk cruise
missiles during this operation, 112 on the first night of the conflict.
If we are to accord to weapon systems influence over the decision to use
force, then in the case of Libya, precedence must be given based simply
on the number of sorties conducted to cruise missiles, aerial refueling
tankers, tactical fighters, and even cargo planes before we come to the
little-used drone. [**The availability of unmanned aerial systems in no
way makes conflict more likely or more brutal**. Quite the opposite, in
fact, seems to be the case. The presumption that were it not for the
availability of drones, the U.S. would refrain from conducting military
operations against terrorists based in Pakistan is highly
dubious]{.underline}. We have an example of an alternative military
option: Operation Enduring Freedom. As Joshua Goldstein pointed out in a
recent article, the use of armed drones in Pakistan may have prevented
the use of far bloodier means. ["Armed drones now attack targets that in
the past would have required an invasion with thousands of heavily armed
troops, displacing huge numbers of civilians and destroying valuable
property along the way."\[]{.underline}3\] According to Robert
Woodward's reporting on President Obama's decision to deploy additional
forces to Afghanistan in 2009, a number of senior advisors proposed a
lower-cost, smaller deployment based on increased use of special
operations forces and unmanned aerial vehicles. I might go even farther
than Goldstein and argue that [Cortright should advocate the greater use
of drones, armed and otherwise, precisely due to his interest in
reducing the frequency, intensity, and costs of conflicts. Just as dash
cameras in police cars and cell phone cameras have led to a decrease in
police brutality and the ability to bring those who violate procedures
to account, the electro-optical sensors on drones can be used to
increase oversight over military forces in the field]{.underline}. In
fact, [cameras]{.underline} can [reduce]{.underline} what Cortright
calls ["the psychological distance that separates the launching of a
strike from its bloody impact."]{.underline} It can also help reduce the
alleged isolation of the American people from the use of force in their
name.

3\. Results In the Table 1, Panel A reports the baseline regressions
includ- ing only the democracy indicators for the full sample (N = 128),
and Panel B presents the estimates with all control variables (N = 99).
The baseline equations show that [democracy is]{.underline} [positively
re- lated to infections]{.underline} at the 1% significance level. When
control variables are added, [coefficients of the democracy variables
con- tinue to be statistically significant]{.underline} at the 1% level
except for column 3 where the Civil Liberties Index is used. In panel B,
both temperature and population share of 65 and older variables'
coefficients are negative and significant for all five equations. Li et
al. (2020), reach similar results for the temperature variable and
(Zimmermann et al., 2020), for the older population group variable.
Haischer et al. (2020) argue that people who are 65 and older are more
likely to wear a mask, and thus the government's stringency policies are
mainly targeted towards this group. Using data from an earlier stage of
the pandemic, Zimmermann et al. (2020) noted that the older age group
has standard activities that make it less exposed to the virus. Both
lines of argument would explain why the possibility of infection is
lower for the older group compared to the younger population. Testing
policy and doctor per 1000 variables are positively related to CP (ex-
cept column 3 for testing policy), which is intuitive and confirm
expectations. Finally, the Government Censorship Effort variable is
negatively related to CP in general and significant in column 2 (Panel
B). This [indicates a weak tendency where more media control leads to
higher infection rates since public attention to the disease is possibly
smaller.]{.underline} The [results of the regressions for
the]{.underline} **[Case Fatality Rate]{.underline}** [are quite
different]{.underline}. [There is a **negative
relationship**]{.underline} [between]{.underline} **[all democracy
measures]{.underline}** [and CFR. **All coefficients are statistically
significant**]{.underline} [at the 1% level]{.underline} except for
column 5 where it is 10%. [We observe COVID-19 to have a **smaller
effect on mortality for more democratic countries**]{.underline}.
Government Censorship has the largest coefficient at the 1% significance
level and the sign of the coefficient is positive. This implies that a
lower degree of censorship is associated with a larger case fatality
rate. Beds per 1000 population and testing policy both have a negative
relationship with the Case Fatality Rate. Therefore, more hospital beds
and more tests may help to decrease CFR. GDP is also negatively related
to CFR. This result is consistent with the results of previous studies
(Liu et al., 2020; Zimmermann et al., 2020). On the other hand, the
share of the population over the age of 65 is positively related to CFR
at 1%; this means that once elderly people get the disease, they are
more likely to die (Zimmermann et al., 2020). Results remain robust (see
Online Appendix Table A5) for more detailed controls for the age
distribution of the populations (estimates are not significant) and the
inclusion of continent dummies with the exceptions of temperature (no
longer affect- ing infection rates) and older age (somewhat weaker size
and significance without changing conclusions). 4. Conclusion

higher value on human life and health.**]{.underline}

should **[[have a greater incentive than autocracies to provide
health-promoting resources and services to a larger proportion of the

studies]{.underline}]{.mark}** (11, 12, 13, 14, [15) have **[concluded

child mortality or life expectancy at birth. Some academics16 have
questioned those studies\' results, arguing that democratic leaders do
not need the electoral support of low-income voters to stay in office.
Others17 have claimed that the underlying determining factor is wealth
or the quality of government institutions, rather than the democratic
process. At least four studies16, 18, 19, 20 have found that democracy
has no clear relationship with child and infant mortality.

Conclusions Lipsitch predicts that some 40%-70% of the world's
population will be infected this year.78 Despite political claims, a
vaccine is more likely seen within a year or two at best.79 [It is no
longer realistic to expect the management of these gaps in infectious
disease outbreaks, especially those that threaten to be epidemics and
pandemics, are to be capably managed in their present state of willful
denial and offenses by many countries, **especially those** that are
**ruled by authoritarian regimes.**]{.underline}80 [Despite resistance
to globalization's health benefits that would markedly benefit the
global community during these crises by authoritarian
regimes]{.underline}, in 2015, [I called for a new WHO leadership
granted by the International Health Regulations Treaty that has
consequences if violated. I stated: The intent of a legally binding
Treaty to improve the capacity of all countries to detect, assess,
notify, and respond to public health threats are being
ignored.]{.underline} While there is a current rush to admonish
globalization in favor of populism, **[epidemic and pandemics deserve
better than decisions being made by incapable autocrats.]{.underline}**
During Ebola, a rush by the Global Health Security Agenda partners to
fill critical gaps in administrative and operational areas was crucial
in the short term, but questions remain as to the real priorities of the
global leadership as time elapses and critical gaps in public health
protections and infrastructure take precedence over the economic and
security needs of the developed world. The response from the Global
Outbreak Alert and Response Network and foreign medical teams to Ebola
proved indispensable to global health security, but both deserve
stronger strategic capacity support and institutional status under the
WHO leadership granted by the \[International Health Regulations\]
Treaty. [Treaties are the most successful means the world has in
preventing, preparing for, and controlling epidemics in an increasingly
globalized world]{.underline}. **[Other options are not
sustainable]{.underline}**. [Given the gravity of on-going failed treaty
management, the slow and incomplete process of reform, the magnitude and
complexity of infectious disease outbreaks, and the rising severity of
public health emergencies, a recommitment must be made to complete and
restore the original mandates as a collaborative and coordinated global
network responsibility, **not one left to the actions of individual
countries.**]{.underline} The [bottom line is that the global community
can no longer tolerate an ineffectual and passive international response
system]{.underline}. As such, this Treaty has the potential to become
one of the most effective treaties for crisis response and risk
reduction world-wide. Practitioners and health decision-makers
world-wide must break their silence and advocate for a stronger Treaty
and a return of WHO authority. Health practitioners and health
decision-makers world-wide must break their silence and advocate for a
stronger Treaty and a return of WHO's undisputed global authority.81
Will China's unilateral decisions just be a temporary stay as it was
post-SARS, or is China capable of adopting, without conditions, the WHO
public health requirements they have so far ignored? [Autocratic leaders
in history have a direct impact on health security. Dictatorships, with
direct knowledge of the negative impact on health, create **adverse
political and economic conditions** that only **complicate the problem
further**. **This is more evident in autocratic regimes where health
protections have been seriously and purposely curtailed.**]{.underline}
This summary acknowledges that [autocratic regimes are **seriously
handicapped** by sociopathic narcissistic leaders who are incapable of
understanding the health consequences of infectious diseases or their
impact on their population]{.underline}. [They will universally
accelerate defenses indigenous to their personality traits when faced
with contrary facts, double down against or deny accurate science to the
contrary, delay timely precautions, and fail to meet health expectations
required of nations under existing International Health Regulations,
laws, and Epidemic Control surveillance]{.underline}.82 [Kavanaugh's
Lancet editorial initially praised Chinese tactics that reflected a
level of control only available to authoritarian regimes. As days and
weeks passed, it revealed a government that inherently became victims of
their own propaganda based on "need to avoid sharing bad
news."]{.underline} [He concluded that **authoritarian politics
inhibited an effective response**, and that **openness and competitive
politics favor a strategically fair public health
strategy**.]{.underline}83 [**Democratic nations in comparison to
autocratic regimes** recognize that **public health fundamentally
depends on public trust**.]{.underline}84 The WHO's China Joint Mission
on Coronavirus Disease report has applauded China's eventual response
capability and capacity with strict measures to interrupt or minimize
transmission chains with extremely proactive surveillance, rapid
diagnosis, isolation tracking, quarantine, and population acceptance of
these measures, to implement the measures to contain COVID-19 within the
country.85 [It **must not be forgotten** that **China's authoritarian
rule "put secrecy and order ahead of openly confronting the growing
crisis** and risking alarm or political embarrassment,"]{.underline} 86
arrested and compelled Dr. Li Wenliang to sign a statement that his
warning constituted "illegal behavior," all of which delayed a concerted
public health offensive that led to his death.86 This was an "issue of
inaction" that would have contained COVID-19 within China and remains a
potent symbol of China's failures.86 [There is **no evidence** that the
authoritarian regime has or will change to prevent this from happening
again]{.underline}.87 I suspect China's sophisticated censorship and
propaganda systems will outlast any public health improvements.
