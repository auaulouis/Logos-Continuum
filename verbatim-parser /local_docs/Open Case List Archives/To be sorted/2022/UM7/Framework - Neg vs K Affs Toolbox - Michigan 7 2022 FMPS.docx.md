[Where AI is discussed in reference to public policy, **the narrative
tends to veer towards the extreme.**]{.underline} [Elon Musk's widely
reported warning, in August 2017, that AI represents 'vastly more risk'
than North Korea is a case in point]{.underline}.138 While
AI undoubtedly poses some significant risks that must be mitigated,
[**discussion of these often crowds out sober analysis** of the ways
in which machine-aided decision-making is likely to change international
politics in the relatively near term. Such analysis should have both
near- and far-term goals. For the near term, the aim should be to
achieve meaningful and measureable progress towards **demystifying the
technology** and enabling **productive conversations** between those
developing it and those who will be responsible for implementing and
regulating it. At the same time, discussions around AI should not lose
sight of the fundamental ways in which it may change the nature
of international politics and power structures, and should aim to build
up ethical and legal frameworks to manage those changes.]{.underline}

While no one can predict the exact trajectory that AI will take over the
coming decades, it is clear that it will have an increasing and profound
impact on society. To prepare for this transformation, this report makes
a number of recommendations for policymakers:

- [AI expertise must not reside in only a small number of countries --
  or solely within narrow segments of the population]{.underline}. As AI
  is entrusted with more and more significant responsibilities,
  programmers and policymakers alike must be more aware of its potential
  impact on existing structural inequalities. The processes by which AI
  systems are developed and deployed must be as inclusive as possible in
  order to mitigate societal risks, and inherent bias issues, at the
  point of inception. Policymakers must invest in developing home-grown
  talent and expertise in AI if countries are to be independent of the
  current dominant AI expertise that is concentrated particularly
  in China and the US. This will mean investing in education at all
  levels, both to foster a pipeline of leading AI engineers, and
  to ensure a workforce that is developing skills that AI possibly will
  not be able to replicate, such as those that value emotional capital.

- Corporations, governments and foundations alike should allocate
  funding to develop and deploy AI systems with humanitarian goals.
  There are significant advantages that AI could bring to the
  humanitarian sector, including through the use of complex datasets and
  planning algorithms that could, for instance, improve response times
  in humanitarian emergencies. More research needs to be done with
  discrete sectors to consider the specific implications that advances
  in AI will bring to them. Because AI development for humanitarian
  purposes is unlikely to be immediately profitable for the private
  sector, a concerted effort needs to be made to develop such systems
  on a not-for-profit basis.

- Understanding of the capacities and limitations of artificially
  intelligent systems must not be the exclusive preserve of technical
  experts. The information technology revolution will undoubtedly need
  more STEM graduates, but AI developers also need more 'soft' skills
  both at the operator level and in terms of integrating AI successfully
  into larger decision-making networks. Better education and training
  on what AI is -- and, critically, what it is not -- should be made
  as broadly available as possible.

- [Developing strong working relationships, particularly in the defence
  sector, between public and private AI developers is critical, as much
  of the innovation is taking place in the commercial
  sector.]{.underline} The defence sector needs to find a way to harness
  and utilize the innovation that the rapidly evolving commercial market
  for AI technology is developing with, in some cases, greater resources
  to dedicate to it. Ensuring that intelligent systems charged with
  critical tasks can carry them out safely and ethically will require
  openness between different types of institutions.

- Given the broad applicability of the technology, clear codes
  of practice are necessary to ensure that the benefits of AI can
  be shared widely while its concurrent risks are well managed. Neither
  engineers nor policymakers alone possess the tools necessary
  to design, test and implement these codes -- rather, they will require
  sustained and cooperative engagement between those communities.
  Policymakers and technologists should, moreover, understand the ways
  in which regulating artificially intelligent systems may be
  fundamentally different from regulating arms or trade flows, while
  also drawing relevant lessons from those models.

- Particular attention must be paid by developers and regulators to the
  question of human--machine interfaces. Artificial and human
  intelligence are fundamentally different, and interfaces between the
  two must be designed carefully, and reviewed constantly, in order to
  avoid misunderstandings that in many applications could have serious
  consequences.

#### NATO's involvement in AI ensures global prosperity and ethical use.

[AI, ML and BD offer great opportunities, but also present risks and
challenges]{.underline}. This analysis has tried to alleviate the most
pressing worries: [in so far as the public concerns are related to rapid
geo-economic transitions, sudden redistributions of military power, or
the escalation of military crises, there are reasons to be relatively
optimistic. This has many implications both for international security
and for NATO, its constituent bodies, its member states and its
partners.]{.underline}

First, [many are worried about an AI arms race.]{.underline} Based on
the analysis presented in this article, [we should not be and, probably,
we should even reinterpret our competitors' actions. Put simply, based
on what is written so far, Russian President Vladimir Putin's famous
Lords of the Ringslike speech about AI as a key instrument to control
the world could have been intended to generate panic and thus slow down
NATO and its member countries since Russia lacks the technological bases
for competing in this field.]{.underline} However, if Russia's Ministry
of Defense agrees with President Putin and then wants to reduce funding
to nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles and nuclear submarines in order
to invest in a set of so far unproven, unreliable and combat-ineffective
technologies, we should definitely not oppose this move -- and probably
even encourage them to.

Second, **[NATO and its member states should not remain passive
observers]{.underline}**. [On the contrary, **they should start
preparing to address the challenges** that AI, ML and BD
raise.]{.underline} In other words, the Alliance should start a process
of "NATO-mation". [This is important for three main reasons. By honing
and improving existing technological and industrial capabilities, NATO
can]{.underline} preserve and enhance its military superiority and thus
[guarantee its contribution for global security in the years ahead.
Next, for this purpose, NATO should start thinking and addressing the
complements challenges that will emerge: from infrastructural
constraints to shortage of talent. Last but not least, by engaging with
these issues, the Atlantic Alliance **can ensure that its values,
ethical stances as well as moral commitments will inform this new
age**.]{.underline}

### Policy Research Good---Biotech

#### Debates about biotechnology are good. It informs student's ethics, challenges preconceived biases, and increases engagement.

1.3 [Debate as a Good Educational Practice in Higher
Education]{.underline}

**[Quality instruction is a strong motivating factor in higher
education]{.underline}** (Sogunro, 2017), [linked to critical thinking,
problem solving, communication, acquiring of presentation skills and
team working]{.underline} (Roy & Macchiette, 2005). Cranton (2002)
[reported that critical thinking should become a clear target of all
forms of education and mainly of the adults, since by this way the
students become open minded in new ways of thinking.]{.underline}
However, Bissell and Lemons (2006) noted that higher education do not
always encourage the students to think critically. Literature review
shows that **[the debate as an educational technique is considered to
significantly contribute to the development of equivalent
skills]{.underline}**. Walker and Warhust (2000) argued that [the use of
debates in the educational process is effective for the development of
critical thinking and strengthens analytical problem solving,
communication, presentation skills, group forming and cooperation
skills, as well as critical approaches of the subject of the
course.]{.underline} Brown (2015) argues that the use of [debates as an
in-class teaching strategy improves students' critical thinking and
collaborative learning skills]{.underline}. Moeller (1985) realized that
although many trainees are initially concerned regarding the procedure
of the debate, [the technique was proven to be valuable and helped them
in developing critical thinking skills.]{.underline} Goodwin (2003), who
also used the debate as a teaching method, asked the opinion of the
students on the process he followed and he reported that many students
commented the lack of familiarization with this method and that
sometimes they felt awkward. [The majority of the students, however,
responded positively, noting that the debate helped them in acquiring
in-depth knowledge and in familiarization with the arguments' quest,
analysis and presentation. The debate helped them to come across and
face different views and to improve their critical
thinking.]{.underline}

[Professors use often the debate in order to **increase the active
participation of the students**,]{.underline} especially in the field of
Human and Social Sciences and selectively in the field of Natural
Sciences or Technology (Jugdev, Markowski, & Mengel, 2004). Proulx
(2004) **[used the debates in the field of Biosciences for the analysis,
control and assessment of arguments and the results of his research
showed that the technique helps the students to investigate critically
biological issues that influence the society]{.underline}**. Vo and
Morris (2006) discovered that [the debates used during their teaching
increased the benefits of the traditional lecturing, due to the active
and creative participation of the students]{.underline}. In addition,
Osborne (2005) realized that [this technique helps the students to learn
discipline and strengthened their ability to approach knowledge with
critical and moral spirit. He also argued that the ability to focus and
present valid and convincing arguments contributes positively to the
preparation of their future carrier. Dickson (2004) reports that,
through the debate, the ability of the students to work in groups and to
analyze the arguments is enhanced, improving by this way their ability
to think critically. Team working may lead to higher levels of thinking,
involving analysis, synthesis, and evaluation through the use of
convincing evidence that they have to present and provides them the
chance to participate actively in the process of learning, therefore
critical thinking is achieved (Gokhale, 1995).]{.underline}

The debates may take many forms. The most common kind of debate is in a
class when there is the option for two trainees or two groups to develop
opposite opinions for a certain issue (Tumposky, 2004). The traditional
process of the debates begins with the choice of the topic, which leads
the two groups either to defend it or to oppose against it; in other
words, the one group supports the one aspect and the other group is
opposed to it. However, in the debate, success does not mean victory,
but the degree of interest and motivation achieved by each group. Roy
and Macchiette (2005) highlighted particularly the importance of the
assessment and the feedback processes for the successful application of
the debate technique.

Darby (2007) argued on the benefits arising from [the use of debates in
teaching: the development of critical and analytical thinking,
strengthening at the same time group working and
communication.]{.underline} He believes that [it is an effective
educational tool that increases the responsibility for learning and the
active participation required by all participants]{.underline}.
Moreover[, it provides an experience through which the students can
develop research abilities on current issues, become capable in
preparing rational arguments, learn to differentiate between subjective
and well-documented information, to express their aspects and pose
question based on evidence and to listen actively different
opinions]{.underline}, as Kennedy (2007) noted. The most important,
however, advantage of the method, as highlighted by Darby (2007), is
that the students reported that the experience of the debate is amusing
and that they really have a great time working!

1.4 **[Debates in Teaching Bioethics]{.underline}** in the Department of
Molecular Biology and Genetics, Democritus University of Thrace

The module "Bioethics" is an elective course in the curriculum of the
Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics (DMBG), Democritus
University of Thrace (DUTH) in Greece. [In the frame of the course,
several topics relative to the ethical development of Bioscientists
associated with their role as scientists and researchers in the modern
scientific world are set. The goal is the development of critical
scientific thinking and analysis of complex scientific and social
problems that arise from the biotechnological evolution in the frame of
a responsible and ethical approach in the field of
Biosciences.]{.underline}

McGonigal (2007) noted that educators in any field may use the theory of
Transformative Learning, so the two professors who were assigned the
co-teaching of Bioethics decided to base their approach on
Transformative Learning Theory, as it was considered suitable for the
development of critical thinking on ethical issues in the field of
Biosciences.

Τhe course was structured in four major chapters:

Chapter 1: Introduction to Bioethics

Basic principles of bioethics

Issues of scientific development and management of ethical dilemmas in
the modern scientific environment

Chapter 2: The legal framework

The legal framework in Greece -- directives and legislation

The legal framework in Europe -- directives and legislation

Bioethics and International forums

Chapter 3: Modern issues of Bioethics in Molecular Biosciences

\- Designer babies

\- DNA banks

\- Genetic modification and agricultural activity

\- Human genome and associated challenges

Chapter 4: The role of the Bioscientist

Ethical dimension of the role of the Bioscientist

Professional ethics in Biosciences

The topics of the 3rd Chapter mentioned above, along with the proposed
references were announced to the students, who chose their partners and
formed groups of three and then they selected the topic that they wanted
to work on, as well as the negative or positive aspect to support. The
process of the debates included the stages below:

\- 10 min presentation of the aspect of each group, based on scientific
data and arguments

\- 5 min development of arguments in response to the points that the
opposed group has posed

\- 3 min for concluding remarks of each group.

Subsequently, all students and trainers voted for the most convincing
aspect and the lesson was completed with an extensive and open
discussion on each topic.

2\. Methodology

[The present study is a small scale study that was focused on the
students' debate experience]{.underline}. The methodology of the
research followed the qualitative approach, because it was considered
the most appropriate for the in-depth penetration in the students'
opinions. The research question was: What would the students consider as
significant regarding this specific learning experience? Data was
collected in June 2016, by the free, associative recording of the
students' opinions, that allowed the respondents to report what was
worth highlighting, the "truth" that they wanted to mention by answering
the open question: \"How would I describe my experience from my
participation in the debate?\". This technique, because it is anonymous,
free and open, ensures that the original experiences and feelings will
be deposited (Atkinson, 1998). It is noted that from the 24 students who
followed the course of "Bioethics" during the academic year 2015-16, 19
students responded and thus, constituted the sample of the research.

Data was processed by the Content Analysis method, which, using the data
categorization process and classification into thematic categories with
a clear conceptual definition, allows the contents of the narrations to
be translated into findings, which are then interpreted and discussed in
qualitative terms. Content Analysis is considered appropriate for
"decoding and interpreting written data and especially personal beliefs,
attitudes, assumptions and perspectives" (Verma & Mallick, 2004: 224).
The analysis process included data interpretation by the researchers,
which is the most interesting and provoking - at the same time - part of
data processing in qualitative research (Kyriazi, 2006). The views of
all students who participated in the survey were used.

The five categories of data that occurred were:

\- interesting learning experience

\- skills acquired

\- co-operation and teamwork

\- active learning

\- development of critical thinking and transformation of assumptions

2.1 Study Constraints

It should be noted, however, that since this is a small-scale study and
the qualitative analysis is based on the description and discussion of
the views of the particular students questioned, this research does not
lead to the generalization of its findings. Therefore, generalization of
the findings is not supported in any way, but the essential aspects
regarding the educational process of a debate and the experience gained
by the students of the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics is
highlighted.

3\. Findings

[The students\' answers showed how interesting the learning experience
of integrating debates into the "Bioethics" course has been for them.
They noted that debates have been an unprecedented, significant and
distinct learning experience, with multidimensional
components:]{.underline}

My participation in the debate, was absolutely positive. It has been a
very important and original life experience.

Very nice experience and I\'m glad I had the opportunity to attend this
course before I finish my studies.

It was an interesting, pleasant and creative experience. Although pilot,
the course was 'smooth' and efficient.

My experience in the debate was something special.

Initially, I would describe my experience in the debate as unique, since
there has not been anything like that in any other course.

My participation in the course of Bioethics was a very special
experience, mainly due to the teaching methods. The use of debates was
undoubtedly unprecedented for all of us. When I applied for the course,
I could not imagine how terrific experience it would be.

I think my participation in the debate was a very good experience,
because I did not have the opportunity to take part in anything similar
before.

Indeed, I was impressed by the excellence of the students\'
presentations, who supported their topics and the good work and research
accomplished was obvious, based on the latest scientific facts.

I will be absolutely honest. The teachers were there for us (believe me
they are not all like that!), the course was interesting (VERY) and not
boring at all.

[Many students focused on the skills they acquired as a very important
element of this educational experience:]{.underline}

It **[contributes to the development of other skills beyond scientific
knowledge]{.underline}** (e.g. speech readiness, argumentation).

Personally, it has given me the opportunity to develop skills that I
could not develop tthrough \[sic\] the other courses, mainly soft
skills, which is well known that we will need in the future.

We worked as much as we could on the topic we had been assigned and
focused on both the techniques used in debates and the scientific part
(scientific presentation of the aspect and readiness to answer in
potential \"attacks\").

Through the debate, I mainly managed to get experience of what is like
to debate in front of an audience (most important, especially in our
science).

Not only we had to acquire the knowledge about the topic we had to
defend, but mainly to assimilate and \"filter\" it, so that we can cope
with any arguments that the opposing team would put forward.

It was indeed a very enjoyable and productive process and what I mainly
gained, beyond knowledge, was the ability to respond quickly to a
question within a friendly and safe climate.

Personally, it was the first time I participated in a similar activity
and I think I have been left with new knowledge, skills in argumentation
and a lot of questions.

Some, in fact, focused on the co-operation and teamwork they had to
display, in order to organize their work:

Initially, there was trust and excellent cooperation among my team
members. The way in which the arguments and concerns were presented was
also a challenge while working in a team, but also a lesson of respect
for those who may have the opposite view.

I worked with people I had never worked before, and with their help we
managed to reach teamwork.

I think that our participation in the debates and discussions that
followed brought us all a little closer, giving us the opportunity to
meet students we didn't know.

The most appreciated element was the energetic way of learning promoted
through the course, instead of traditional lectures:

Information collection on the topic, the organization of data and the
confrontation with the \"rival\" group offered an environment for
arguments' exchange, something that I haven't experienced in the past.
For this reason, I believe the whole experience was excellent and I
would definitely repeat it if I had the chance.

[Knowledge was not simply provided]{.underline} by the professors, [but
we went deep into the essence of it. This is the reason why I consider
the debate very educative and effective for this course]{.underline}. In
addition, by listening to other groups, we consolidated the information
much better than in the form of a simple lecture and we were able to
form our own opinion on the topics presented.

The experience was exciting. We worked at regular meetings with my
colleagues and we had a lot of fun, because we discovered each time new
arguments, keeping us alert concerning our data research.

It \"forces\" you to get deeper into the topic you have to defend, and
it proves challenging if you have to defend the opposite view from what
you actually believe. Therefore, I think it is better the course is
taught this way, rather than providing theoretical knowledge on
Bioethics.

The debate was a very nice experience, but mostly a very efficient way
of learning.

Totally different teaching method. Very good experience, especially
taking into account the theoretical courses we have to follow as
students.

I did not have the chance to participate in something like this before
and it helped me a lot to get prepared for similar situations that will
logically arise in the future in my work. Also, the fact that the course
was interactive automatically increased its value and my will to attend
it.

The experience of the specific course was quite different from what I
have seen so far\.... Certainly, this course was not only based on
information transmission, like teaching in an amphitheater.

Indeed, even after the debates, I often felt the need to approach deeper
some topics, due to the high interest originated from the original,
lively and energetic process of the debate.

I think that the choice to offer the course in the form of debates was
interesting; it was something we had not been experienced in another
course.

Finally, [the debates helped the students see that there is not a single
answer to ethical issues in the field of Biosciences, but they have to
develop their own critical thinking **and maybe transform their opinions
and assumptions:**]{.underline}

The initiative undertaken by our Professors, Mrs. Kedraka and Mr.
Kourkoutas led to an exciting course and in collaboration with the
students we acquired experiences, a way of critical thinking on ethical
issues that concern the scientific community.

#### Project-based learning is the best pedagogy for biotechnology. It promotes action research that teaches students to develop real world solutions. That's the only exportable impact!

Abstract

**[Project-based learning and action research are powerful pedagogies in
improving science education]{.underline}**. We implemented a
semester-long course using project-based action research to help
students apply biotechnology knowledge learned in the classroom to the
real world. Students had several choices to make in the project: working
individually or as a team, selecting a topic of interest, and targeting
a local community group. To enhance teachers' abilities to lead students
through action projects, we describe the framework, provide class data,
and discuss ben- efits and challenges encountered. This course could
serve as a model of how project-based action research can benefit
student learning in biotechnology.

Key Words: Biotechnology; project-based research; action projects;
community; real world.

Introduction

[Biotechnology is an interdisciplinary subject that often involves
medicine, agriculture, industrial technology, and commerce]{.underline}.
The International Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
has defined biotechnology as the application of science and technology
to living organisms or parts of them (e.g., micro­ organisms, enzymes,
cells of animals and

plants) to alter living or nonliving materials for the production of
knowledge, goods, and ser­ vices (Chabalengula et al., 2011). Our course
within a biochemistry department focuses on the biochemical knowledge
needed for topics such as genetic modification of food, forensic
analysis, and stem cell research (Halverson et al., 2009, 2010; Rebello
et al., 2012a; Witzig et al., 2013).

[The diverse benefits of biotechnological processes highlight the need
for students to be]{.underline}

[scientifically informed so that they can appreciate how biotechnology
affects their lives and communities. **The traditional instruction of
biotechnology, limited in classrooms, also makes it difficult to engage
students in using biotechnology meaningfully in real life. Active
learning of biotechnology can involve students in serviceable activi­
ties in healthcare, agriculture, and industry.**]{.underline}

To stimulate student learning and heighten curiosity, the National
Research Council emphasized a new way of teaching and learning about
science that reflects the science discipline and implies changes in what
and how students are taught (Singer et al., 2012) and in how students
are assessed (AAAS, 2011). **[Studies have demonstrated that a
project­based approach has the potential to enhance student­directed
scientific inquiry by using technology and collaboration]{.underline}**
(Krajcik et al., 2000; Schneider et al., 2002; Alozie et al., 2009).
[Moreover, students can achieve deeper understanding of science content
and processes when they engage in inquiry]{.underline} (Schneider et
al., 2002). **[In action research, students ask questions, assess needs,
design plans, and carry out actions to benefit a particular
group]{.underline}** (Bradbury & Reason, 2003). In this project­based
action research**[, students encountered five requirements based on
scientific inquiry and action research]{.underline}** (Krajcik et al.,
2000; Krajcik & Blumenfeld, 2006): [(1) assessing the needs of a
community (related to biotechnology by driving ques­tions), (2) designing
and planning actions to address those needs,]{.underline}

[(3) making specific actions to benefit the selected
community,]{.underline}

[(4) gathering and analyzing information and data from those actions,
and (5) reporting find­ ings and reflection. Collaboration and conver­
sation, including discussions with classmates and with adults outside
the classroom, are also considered essential for students to build team­
work skills and share understandings of ideas]{.underline} (Krajcik et
al., 2000; Krajcik & Blumenfeld, 2006; Alozie et al., 2010).

Here, we describe how we employed project­based action­research feature as
a framework for the design and enactment

of a community action project and discuss what we have learned. The
project was developed for one semester of an undergraduate,

project. These questions scaffold students to plan their project (in

nonmajors biotechnology class. The course challenged students to choose
a topic, assess the needs of a community related to that topic, design
an action addressing the needs, and document their work in a multimedia
format of their choice. [The project aimed to be mean­ ingful to students
by connecting to the "real world" of the commu­ nity, requiring students
to witness reactions of citizens regarding biotechnology ideas from
class, and putting ownership of the inquiry in students'
hands.]{.underline}

Description of the Community Action Project

Overview

Arguably, **[the highest form of learning stems from not just knowing
something, but using it and applying it in the real world to help
someone else learn, change their mind, or act
differently.]{.underline}** In this unit, [students had opportunities to
relate their own interests in a biotech­ nology issue to communities by
(1) choosing a topic, (2) assessing the needs of a community and
planning an action related to biotech­ nology, and (3) taking action and
documenting it.]{.underline} Student work was scaffolded by framework
questions in each step (Table 1) to generate the action plan. If
students could not complete their action because of extracurricular
demands, they could choose to write a 15­ to 17­page, double­spaced
research paper for step 3, based on their needs assess­ ment. The length
was effective in discouraging those who might take advantage of the
option -- only one student submitted a paper, and it was well developed.
Moreover, students could choose to work indi­ vidually on the project or
in a group of up to five. The larger the group, the higher the
productivity expected. Class time was provided to help students find
people who shared an interest in similar topics. Class time was also
used to plan, get feedback from instructors, and discuss ideas. The
project entailed a small time commitment outside of class to collect
data -- approximately 2 hours, depending on the type of project.

Choosing a Community & Topic

The [first step of the project was to figure out a topic of interest and
how it might relate to a group in the real world]{.underline}. Students
were given examples of potential projects and a list of topics and
groups to con­ sider as a starting point (Table 2).

Assessing the Needs of a Community Group

The second step of the project involved assessing the needs of a group
that had a stake in the topic. Students could conduct background
research, interview stakeholders, or collect survey data to accom­ plish
this. To better assess the targeted community's knowledge, stu­ dents
conducted varied approaches -- such as questionnaires, e­mail surveys,
site visits, and interviews -- demonstrated in the examples below. It
was not necessary to conduct a major research investigation

for this nonmajors class, but the results were intended to provide
students with evidence to inform their action.

Plan an Action Related to Biotechnology

[Next, students employed their findings in planning steps to inform,
influence, help, and/or support their community groups.]{.underline}
Students provided all action­plan materials and concisely documented
their work in the community (Table 3).

Additional Teaching Suggestions

Group evaluation of peers and instructional feedback were impor­ tant for
effective group collaboration (e.g., see Table 4). Deadlines were spaced
for the three steps of the project (Table 5) to allow for instructional
feedback. This enabled instructors to provide written feedback at the
completion of each step. Scoring guidelines for step 3 were given to
support students in reporting their actions or paper effectively.

Instructors also met with students throughout the project as needed.

What We Have Learned

Seeking methods to enhance science teaching and learning at the
undergraduate level, we realized that [adding project­based action
research]{.underline} to the biotechnology nonmajors course benefited
students in several ways. It **[encouraged students to develop skills in
collabo­ ration, investigating questions and analyzing
data]{.underline}**. **[The course also appeared to benefit
problem­solving skill development, interest in applying academic
knowledge to the real world, and excitement in contributing to local
community issues.]{.underline}** Although challenges arise with any
authentic group project, students were able to work through all stages
with concrete guidelines and instructor feedback. Below, we illustrate
representative projects and discuss benefits and limitations.

Evidence of Action Projects in Biotechnology

We show two projects with excerpts from steps 1, 2, and 3 and the
multimedia reports that students developed to inform or influence their
community groups (Figures 1 and 2). These two projects had topics that
were common among the students.

• Sample of project 1: Stem cell research (one student) (Figure 1)

• Sample of project 2: Genetically modified plants (team of three
students) (Figure 2)

Figure 1. Example project of stem cell research.

Figure 2. Example project of genetically modified plants.

Benefits

**[Students were challenged to develop skills in interpreting and
applying knowledge in an action plan based on a community's
needs.]{.underline}** During their execution of project­based research,
[students were encouraged to connect their personal goals with academic
study and to solve real­world problems. Through action research, they
devel­ oped **positive attitudes toward community engagement** and
action, along with **problem­solving skills and deeper understanding of
social issues.**]{.underline} Moreover, [students gained experience in
communicating and explaining scientific knowledge to public
audiences]{.underline} of various levels and ages through brochures or
presentations.

The project also focused on students' collaboration and team­ work
skills. Students constructed a shared meaning of concepts and
experiences, drew on others' experiences, and reflected on their own
thoughts. In general, this provided opportunities for students to form
connections with peers, faculty, and community members while con­ ducting
worthwhile projects.

[Students were provided ownership in choosing topics. Several options
within the project seemed to empower students with a sense of personal
efficacy and commitment, since they could integrate their own interest
and strength into biotechnology research.]{.underline} Whatever options
they chose, students would earn research experience related to real­world
application.

It appeared that the semester­length project with a specific time­ frame
for the three steps fostered commitment by the students. They were aware
of the timed nature of their assignments and were not allowed to
procrastinate. The three­step guideline questions and instructor feedback
were helpful in preparing students to implement their action plan and
benefit from the project.

The action project triggered excitement and linked inquiry, curi­ osity,
and creativity to the learning process. Therefore, students were more
curious about the uncertain aspects of the project and eager to explore
their topic through research. Developing students' curi­ osity and
creativity may be crucial in affecting later interest in science fields.
Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson says it best: "In the end, it is the
people who are curious who change the world."

Limitations

Adding action research to the biotechnology course appeared to aid the
students, teacher, and community. However, at the initial stage,
students may find it difficult to find partners and design an action
plan. Therefore, instructors adopting this project approach may need to
provide office hours to assist students and give them sufficient time to
work on their projects.

The projects were designed to benefit the students. While com­ munities
perhaps benefited as well, for example by becoming more educated,
long­term collaborations and partnerships are needed to institute real
change in communities. A potential next step would be to develop
partnerships with a few of the community groups so that they could work
with students each semester. This would also lessen the difficulty of
choosing and networking with particular groups each semester.

Action projects may bring up time­ and group­management chal­ lenges.
Giving advice for planning projects and then grading various topics can
be time consuming. Also, ensuring fair grading of group projects on
different topics could be difficult, and the scoring guide and
participation form were helpful in this regard.

#### Posing specific research questions about biotechnology is good. It promotes scientific literacy, analytical reasoning, and information testing. And, peer dialogue over research is an intrinsic good!

Background

**[Asking questions is considered a crucial component in developing
scientific literacy, as emphasized in various policy documents
worldwide]{.underline}** (Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting
Authority \[ACARA\] 2012; European Commission 2007; National Research
Council \[NRC\] 2012; United Kingdom Department of Education 2013).
[Students' questions play an important role in promoting their
scientific habits of mind and their understanding of scientific
knowledge]{.underline} (Chin and Osborne 2008). Students are expected to
ask their own research questions while participating in inquiry learning
(Lombard and Schneider 2013), and teachers are expected to teach their
students to ask research questions that are feasible for investigations,
by providing them with inquiry environments that encourage asking
research questions (Hartford and Good 1982). The teacher's assistance is
required in scaffolding students' learning, transforming their questions
into research questions that are appropriate for authentic scientific
inquiry (Wayne Allison and Shrigley 1986). [However, in most simple
inquiry tasks that are carried out in schools, the research questions
are given to the students, in contrast to authentic scientific inquiry,
where scientists are expected to develop and explore their own research
questions]{.underline} (Chinn and Malhotra 2002). In light of the need
for a better understanding of the processes contributing to the
development of students' ability to ask research questions, we explored
the teaching and learning of this ability in an innovative
inquiry-oriented program entitled Bio-Tech. We demonstrate that a
student-centered teaching strategy that includes a peer-critique
activity during the lesson on how to ask research questions improved
students' ability to formulate research questions that are appropriate
for investigation in the Bio-Tech program.

Inquiry-based science teaching

**[Engaging students in scientific inquiry is one of the principal goals
of science education, recommended by researchers and in various policy
documents]{.underline}** (Bybee 2000; European Commission 2007; National
Research Council \[NRC\] 1996, 2000).

One of the commonly accepted definitions of scientific inquiry is the
one published in the National Research Council (NRC) (1996):
"[Scientific inquiry refers to the diverse ways in which scientists
study the natural world and propose explanations based on the evidence
derived from their work. Inquiry also refers to the activities of
students in which they develop knowledge and understanding of scientific
ideas, as well as an understanding of how scientists study the natural
world]{.underline}" (p. 23). The NRC further elaborates on the
components of scientific inquiry: "[Inquiry is a multifaceted activity
that involves making observations; posing questions; examining books and
other sources of information to see what is already known; planning
investigations; reviewing what is already known in light of experimental
evidence; using tools to gather, analyze, and interpret data; proposing
answers, explanations, and predictions; and communicating the results.
Inquiry requires identification of assumptions, use of critical and
logical thinking, and consideration of alternative
explanations]{.underline}" (p. 26). We base the research presented in
this article on the above definition of inquiry.

The NRC (2000) suggests five features that best define the teaching and
learning of inquiry. Engaging in scientifically oriented questions is
one of these features. Asking questions is also one of the eight crucial
scientific practices suggested in the recent framework for K-12 science
education (NRC 2012). **[Students around the world are required to learn
about and gain an understanding of the inquiry process and develop their
understanding of scientific practices by experiencing authentic inquiry
in an active learning environment]{.underline}** (Abd-El-Khalick et al.
2004; Bybee 2000; European Commission 2007; National Research Council
\[NRC\] 1996**[). By practicing inquiry, students are expected to
cultivate scientific habits of mind, practice logical scientific
reasoning, develop critical thinking abilities in a scientific context,
and experience meaningful learning of scientific concepts and
processes]{.underline}** (Chinn and Malhotra 2002; Harlen 2004;
Hmelo-Silver et al. 2007). However, a debate still exists regarding the
goals, methods, and strategies used to incorporate inquiry into the
science-education classroom (European Commission 2007; Tamir 2006;
Windschitl et al. 2008), and many issues remain unclear regarding the
learning goals and suitable strategies for teaching scientific inquiry
(Furtak et al. 2012; Minner et al. 2010).

Asking research questions

**[Asking questions is a core scientific practice required for gaining
scientific literacy and developing students' critical thinking and their
understanding of the inquiry process]{.underline}** (Cuccio-Schirripa
and Steiner 2000; Dori and Herscovitz 1999; Hartford and Good 1982;
National Research Council \[NRC\] 2012; Pedrosa-de-Jesus et al. 2012).
The goals of teaching how to ask questions are to direct students'
knowledge construction, foster communication, help them self-evaluate
their understanding, and increase their motivation and curiosity (Chin
and Osborne 2008). Asking questions is an integral part of the practice
of critiquing, which is important for developing students' scientific
literacy (Henderson et al. 2015).

Research questions, also termed researchable questions (Chin and
Kayalvizhi 2002; Cuccio-Schirripa and Steiner 2000), investigable
questions (Chin, 2002), or operational questions (Wayne Allison and
Shrigley 1986), are questions that call for hands-on, manipulative,
operational actions and can lead to a process of collecting data to
answer them (Hartford and Good 1982). Research questions should be
meaningful, interesting, and challenging for the students, providing
them with opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge, skills, and
abilities and also encouraging them to exercise their critical and
creative thinking (Chin and Kayalvizhi 2002). To answer the research
questions, they must be appropriate to the student's cognitive
developmental level and the procedures should be accessible and
manageable to the student (Keys 1998). Students' research questions
should be investigable within the limitations of time and materials. The
inquiry process that is required to answer research questions should not
be too expensive, complicated, or dangerous to perform (Chin and
Kayalvizhi 2002). Furthermore, research questions should lead to genuine
exploration and discovery of previously unknown knowledge
(Cuccio-Schirripa and Steiner 2000).

Students are expected to ask their own research questions while
participating in scientific inquiry (Cuccio-Schirripa and Steiner 2000).
These questions should help students progress to the next stages of the
inquiry process (Chin 2002) and develop their procedural and conceptual
knowledge (Chin and Brown 2002). Students are expected to formulate
their own research questions during their school science learning
(National Research Council \[NRC\] 2007). In addition, [students should
be able to distinguish between research questions and other types of
questions and to refine their empirical questions that lead to open
investigations]{.underline} (National Research Council \[NRC\] 2000).
Harris et al. (2012) investigated fifth-grade teachers' instructional
moves and teaching strategies while teaching students how to ask
research questions. They found that although the teachers displayed a
student-centered and dialogic approach, they experienced challenges in
developing their students' ideas into investigable questions. Lombard
and Schneider (2013) found that high-school biology majors' ability to
write research questions appropriate for investigation improved while
maintaining their ownership of the inquiry process. Some of the
students' ability to write appropriate research questions was achieved
by employing structured teacher guidance while engaging students in peer
discussions (Lombard and Schneider 2013). Considering the above, [there
is a need to explore means of promoting the learning of how to ask
research questions in science classrooms.]{.underline} This study aims
to explore the development of students' ability to ask research
questions while participating in an inquiry-oriented program.

Classroom discourse and communicative approach

Examining classroom discourse is a powerful tool for evaluating the
development of students' scientific understanding and abilities (Osborne
2010; Pimentel and McNeill 2013). The discourse that is carried out in
most secondary science classrooms is teacher-centered (Newton et al.
1999), as it is difficult for teachers to shift from the traditional
teacher-centered instruction to more student-centered discursive
teaching strategies (Jimenez-Aleixandre et al. 2000; Lemke 1990).

One of the methods of investigating classroom discourse is the
communicative approach. **[The communicative approach analytical
framework]{.underline}** was developed by Mortimer and Scott (2003**[)
to examine and classify types of classroom discourse.]{.underline}**
This approach focuses on the teacher--student interactions that serve to
develop students' ideas and understanding in the classroom. [The
framework is based on sociocultural principles, according to which
individual learning and understanding is influenced by the social
interaction context]{.underline} (Scott 1998; Vygotsky 1978) and the
role of language during classroom talk (Lemke 1990).

**[Central to the communicative approach are the dialogic/authoritative
and interactive/non-interactive dimensions]{.underline}**. The
dialogic/authoritative dimension determines whether the teacher acts as
a transmitter of knowledge embodied in one scientific meaning or adopts
a dialogic instruction that encourages exploration of different views
and ideas to develop shared meaning of new knowledge (Scott 1998). In an
authoritative discourse, the discussion is "closed" to other voices,
having a fixed intent and controlled outcome. In a dialogic discourse,
the teacher encourages the students to express their ideas and debate
their points of view. The discussion is "open" and may include several
different views. The intent of the dialogic discourse is generative, and
the outcome is unknown. Scott et al. (2006) suggested that there is a
necessary tension during classroom discourse between the authoritative
and dialogic dimensions. The teachers may shift between approaches,
according to their teaching purposes and goals (Scott et al. 2006).
**[The interactive/non-interactive dimension determines the students'
involvement level during the discourse. In interactive discourse, many
students participate in the discussion, whereas in non-interactive
discourse, the number of students participating in the discussion is
limited to one or a very few.]{.underline}**

Discussion

[To examine the possible development of students' ability to ask
research questions, their questions during lessons designed to formulate
research questions appropriate for investigation in the inquiry-oriented
Bio-Tech program were analyzed]{.underline}. The possible connection
between the two Bio-Tech teachers', Rebecca's and Sam's, teaching
strategy during formulating research-question lesson and the students'
ability to ask research questions was investigated. Rebecca's students'
ability to ask research questions improved during the examined lesson,
whereas that of Sam's students remained low. Since most of Rebecca's
students' research questions were subsequently used for the inquiry
conducted by the students in the Bio-Tech program a few months later, it
is assumed that Rebecca's lesson was fundamental to the students'
acquisition of this ability and for its sustainability for a long period
of time. Sam's students did not demonstrate a significant increase in
the number of written research questions during the lesson, and none of
their questions that were formulated during the lesson were later
investigated in the program.

The initial number of research questions in Rebecca's class was higher
than that in Sam's class. This difference could be explained by the fact
that Rebecca's students had experienced inquiry and the asking of
research questions on other occasions, besides the Bio-Tech program, as
mentioned by Rebecca. Therefore, as suggested in other studies (Chin and
Osborne 2008; Lombard and Schneider 2013), **[it is important to provide
students with opportunities to learn and practice asking research
questions in earlier years and in a variety of educational
activities.]{.underline}** [Previous findings regarding the teaching and
learning of how to ask research questions in authentic-inquiry
environments suggest that students' ability to ask research questions
improve following explicit classroom instruction]{.underline} (Chin
2002; Chin and Osborne 2008; Cuccio-Schirripa and Steiner 2000; Roth and
Roychoudhury 1993). Similarly, our results indicate that 11th-grade
[biotechnology students' ability to ask research questions improved
following explicit instruction on how to ask research questions in the
lesson that included dialogic and interactive whole-class
discussions.]{.underline}

[Examining the communicative approach and main teacher moves during the
lessons indicated that students' ability to ask research questions
developed in the student-centered, dialogic, and interactive
lesson]{.underline} and not in the teacher-centered, authoritative, and
non-interactive lesson. Most whole-class discussions are usually
teacher-led (Newton et al. 1999), governed by the triadic I-R-E dialog
(Duschl and Osborne 2002; Lemke 1990), and teachers tend to avoid
probing and toss-back questions, resulting in limited and simple
responses from the students (Pimentel and McNeill 2013). Dialogic
interactions during whole-class discourse encourage students to share
and discuss their own ideas and views (Lehesvuori et al. 2013). Pimentel
and McNeill (2013) found that teachers who used more dialogic
student-centered interactions in their teaching encouraged the students
to have more reflective thinking and meaningful discussions. In line
with those studies, the Bio-Tech teacher who displayed a
**[student-centered teaching strategy and dialogic/interactive
communicative approach had greater success in teaching her students to
ask research questions]{.underline}** than the teacher who displayed a
more teacher-centered teaching strategy and
authoritative/non-interactive communicative approach. Teachers often
shift their communicative approach during the lesson or teaching
sequences (Lehesvuori et al. 2013; Scott et al. 2006). In the
whole-class discussions that were examined in our study, the two
teachers retained their communicative approach throughout the
discussion. It is possible that examining other parts of the lessons or
other Bio-Tech lessons given by the same teachers might reveal shifts in
their communicative approach and teaching strategies, according to their
goals and lesson plans.

Some studies suggest that the more experience teachers have in
performing authentic scientific inquiry, the better their ability to
teach inquiry becomes (Blanchard et al. 2009). Therefore, a possible
explanation for the differences that were found between the two Bio-Tech
classes could be attributed to the teachers' scientific research
experience. Studies regarding the correlation between teachers' research
experience and their students' learning during inquiry activities have
yielded mixed results. For example, Windschitl (2003) found that among
pre-service science teachers, those who implemented open inquiry in
their classes were those with significant undergraduate or professional
scientific research experience. However, other studies concluded that
neither the academic degree nor the research experience of the teachers
impacted their students' learning during the inquiry school activities
(McNeill et al. 2011; Monk 1994). In the two Bio-Tech case studies
analyzed here, the teachers' academic research experience was negatively
correlated with the development of their students' ability to ask
research questions. Namely, despite the fact that Sam is probably more
experienced in conducting scientific research from his MSc studies (see
Table 1), the students of Rebecca who holds a BSc degree (Table 1)
performed better. This indicates that the academic level of the examined
Bio-Tech teachers may have hindered the students' learning to ask
appropriate research questions. Another possible explanation for this
result is that there were other factors that that may have affected the
students' learning. Such factors might be Sam's students' low cognitive
level prior to the lesson, as was seen in their limited ability to ask
research questions in the pre-lesson questionnaire compared to Rebecca's
students, or Sam's authoritative and non-interactive communicative
approach during the discussed lesson. Another possible factor could be
the size class, since the number of students in Sam's class was larger
than the number in Rebecca's class.

One of this study's limitations is that it examined only two Bio-Tech
teachers and their classes and the teaching that was carried out in one
classroom lesson. However, these teachers are believed to represent
typical high-school biotechnology teachers. Other teachers and lessons
should be investigated to further support our conclusions. Further
research is required to gain a broader view of the teaching and learning
of how to ask research questions.

This study's results indicate that **[students' ability to ask research
questions may develop in student-centered, dialogic, and interactive
lessons]{.underline}**. Encouraging teachers to i[mplement dialogic and
interactive classroom discourse in authentic inquiry could be a
meaningful tool to support the teaching and learning of scientific
abilities such as asking research questions.]{.underline} **[In line
with other studies that have recommended promoting student-centered
teaching strategies in science classrooms and inquiry
learning]{.underline}** (Pimentel and McNeill 2013; Scott et al. 2006;
van Zee and Minstrell 1997), **[we suggest that applying
student-centered, dialogic, interactive teaching strategies during the
teaching of how to ask research questions in inquiry-oriented programs
may develop students' question-asking ability.]{.underline}**

Conclusions

**[In the two examined case studies presented here, a connection was
demonstrated between the more student-centered, dialogic, and
interactive teaching strategy and the development of students' ability
to ask research questions.]{.underline}** In the student-centered class,
most of the research questions that were investigated in the Bio-Tech
program originated from the peer-critique activity during the lesson.
**[This indicates that a student-centered, dialogic, and interactive
teaching strategy may contribute to the development of students' ability
to ask research questions in an inquiry-oriented high-school
program.]{.underline}**

**\[ABSTRACT\]**

[Public attributions of cyber incidents by governments and private
industry have become prevalent in recent years. This article argues that
they display a skewed version of cyber conflict for several operational
and structural reasons]{.underline}, including political, commercial,
and legal constraints. In addition, public attribution of cyber
incidents takes place in a heavily contested information environment,
creating fractured narratives of a shared past. [The
article]{.underline} uses three cyber incidents (Sony Pictures, DNC, and
NotPetya) to show how actors cope with this contested information
environment and [proposes a changed role of academia to address some of
the problems that emerge. To become competent in contesting public
attribution discourses, **universities would have to work more across
physical, disciplinary, and academic boundaries.** The main implications
for democracies are to be more transparent about how attribution is
performed, **enable other civilian actors to study cyber conflict, and
thereby broaden the discourse on cybersecurity politics.**]{.underline}

**\[ABSTRACT ENDS\]**

The "attribution problem," the difficulty of finding out who did it,
used to be one of the most discussed questions in the study of cyber
conflict (Boebert, 2010; Clark & Landau, 2010; Dunn Cavelty, 2008, p.
20; Kello, 2013, p. 33; Lindsay, 2015; Lupovici, 2016; Morgan, 2010;
Nye, 2017; Rid & Buchanan, 2015). [Yet, recent empirical practice
suggests that various actors not only have the capability to attribute,
but have decided to share their findings in public. **Public
attributions claims, however, often remain contested.**]{.underline}

So what is public attribution? Public attribution in its most elementary
form is the blaming of a particular actor as responsible for a cyber
incident.1 It can be undertaken by a variety of actors, including
governments, companies, NGOs, and academia. Governmental attribution is
of particular importance, as government action to assign blame is an
inherently political act. Governments thus have a strong incentive to
use public attribution as a political tool, thereby making it
interesting to the study of contemporary security politics. [For
research on governmental public attribution as an element of security
policy, one can split the public attribution process into two phases:
mechanisms that lead to public attribution and what happens after an
incident is publicly attributed. Little research exists on either phase
with regard to attribution of cyber incidents. This is problematic, as
our understanding of contemporary security policy rests on understanding
what drives threat narratives, how and why those particular ones are
introduced publicly, and how contestation of threat narratives takes
place in the public sphere.]{.underline}

My main contribution is to focus on the second phase of attribution,
namely, what happens after a government goes public about a cyber
incident.2 Understanding this phase is important, as public attributions
of cyber incidents are one of the main sources from which the public
learns about who is attacking whom in cyberspace, thereby shaping the
threat perception of the general public. Most attribution judgements are
published by governments, the private sector, and a small number of
civil society actors. To situate the knowledge space, in which
attribution claims are introduced to, I reflect on this source of
knowledge about cyber conflict by identifying how this knowledge
structurally shapes our understanding of cyber conflict, in particular
due to operational and (political, commercial, and legal) structural
factors. In short, due to the commercial incentives on the private
sector side and the political bias on the government side, the public
data about cyber conflict structurally induces distrust into the
representativeness of the public attribution statements.

A second contribution is to focus on the contestation of public
attribution claims in democracies and the consequences such contestation
brings. Contestation is fundamental to democratic politics. The open
debate, the ability of everyone to freely voice opinions, and the
emergence of truth trough democratic discourse is foundational to the
public sphere of democratic polities. Thus, the ability to contest is a
sign of healthy democratic politics. As this article will show, however,
this openness to contestation, coupled with the information poor
environment, creates particular problems in the area of cybersecurity.
Two main questions are pursued: How do actors engaging in public
attribution cope with the contestations that follow the introduction of
their attribution claims? In what way could academia address those
problems?

Investigating the contestation of public attribution claims and the
consequences of such contestation enables us to better understand the
politics of public attribution. The article argues that public
attribution of cyber incidents takes place in a heavily contested
information environment, creating fractured narratives of a shared past.
Due to the secrecy attached surrounding the attribution processes by
governments, particularly due to concerns of intelligence agencies about
sources and methods, governments are often reluctant to reveal the
evidence underlying the attribution judgments. These are ideal enabling
conditions for other actors to contest governmental claims. In a series
of empirical examples, I reflect on the drivers of contestation after an
incident is publicly attributed and show how attackers and other
constituencies with various political and economic motivations drive
particular narratives.

In a final part, [I propose how academia could be a partial remedy to
this situation. Academia, so far, has not been a strong participant in
the discursive space around particular attributions]{.underline}. This
is despite its commitment to transparency and independence theoretically
making it a well-placed actor to contribute an independent
interdisciplinary contribution on the state of cyber conflict. [Thus, I
argue for an **increasing need for academic interventions** in the area
of attribution. This includes interdisciplinary research on all aspects
of attribution (not just in cybersecurity), and conducting independent
research on the state of cyber conflict historically and contemporarily.
One of the main implications of this research on contestation of
attribution claims for democracies are to be more transparent about how
attribution is performed, **to enable other civilian actors to study
cyber conflict, and to thereby broaden the discourse on what is one of
the main national security challenges of today.**]{.underline}

The article is structured in three parts: First, public attribution is
situated in the context of the literature on the contestation of claims
in public opinion formation and the general biases underlying current
public attribution claims are explained. Second, three empirical
examples are used to reflect on the interaction of public attribution
with a contested information environment, namely, the public
attributions of the intrusions into Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014,
of the intrusions into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016,
and of the NotPetya incident in 2017. In the third part, I assess the
implications of contested attributions and suggest how this calls for a
different role of academia, particularly with regard to research on
attribution in universities. The conclusion offers a perspective on the
biggest research opportunities and challenges in the study of
cybersecurity and attribution in the future.

Public attribution fosters a skewed picture of cyber conflict

Contemporary security policy takes place within a heavily contested
information environment. To better understand how security politics
takes place with regard to cybersecurity, we first have to reflect on
how our knowledge of cyber conflict is constructed. At an elementary
level, we do not directly observe who is using cyber insecurity to
further their interests against whom. Thus, our knowledge space of cyber
conflict is constructed by different information providers. In this
first part, I first situate the contestation of public attribution
claims within the literature on attribution of cyber incidents, before
reflecting on how two operational and three structural factors shape the
public data about cyber conflict in such a way so as to structurally
induce distrust into its representativeness.

Situating public attribution in the literature on attribution of cyber
incidents

The literature on cyber conflict has focused on documenting the shift
from the attribution problem hindering successful policy responses,
towards attribution being often possible for state agencies. For
example, in 2015, Rid and Buchanan challenged three assumptions
prevalent in parts of the literature: Namely, that attribution is
intractable due to the nature of cyberspace, that the difficulty in
attribution is finding the evidence, and that attribution is either
solved or unsolved (Rid & Buchanan, 2015, p. 6).

More recently, scholars are focusing on public attribution, including
whether and how to build an international organization aiding
attribution processes (Eichensehr, 2019, 2020; Finnemore & Hollis, 2017,
pp. 475--476, 2019; Grindal, Kuerbis, Badiei, & Mueller, 2018; Schulzke,
2018; Solomon, 2018). Reflections on the legal, and naming and shaming
aspects of public attribution help to clarify the international
normative function of public attribution (Eichensehr, 2020; Finnemore &
Hollis, 2019), whilst analysis of institutional policy proposals shows
potential ways towards improving transparency and credibility problems
(Egloff & Wenger, 2019; Eichensehr, 2019, 2020; Grindal et al., 2018;
Solomon, 2018). Empirically, in the last five years, public attribution
of cyber incidents has moved from being incredibly rare, to becoming a
more routine national security policy option in international politics.
Despite the increasing prevalence of public attribution claims, little
research---with the exception of Schulzke (2018, discussed below)---has
zoomed in on the two phases of public attribution, namely, first, the
mechanisms that lead to public attribution and second, what happens
after an incident is publicly attributed. Splitting public attribution
processes into these two phases is a useful conceptualization, as there
are a whole series of political processes giving rise to a government
considering public attribution, whilst a different set of political
challenges inform the handling of the situation after having introduced
the public attribution claim.

The lack of research is unfortunate, as both parts are relevant to
understanding where attribution sits within the larger domain of the
politics of cyber insecurity. [First, better understanding the
mechanisms leading to public attribution is important to situate the
actor's own understandings of the domain and their activity in a larger
context. As an example, for the international relations scholarship it
matters whether public attributions are aimed at domestic or
international audiences. Furthermore, the incentives to go public will
shape the type of attributions representing the public record of cyber
conflict, whether they be court cases, public ministerial statements,
technical reports, or joint diplomatic statements delivered with allies.
Second, better understanding what happens after an incident is publicly
attributed is important to assess the utility of public attribution as a
policy tool, but also, to better understand the wider politics of cyber
insecurity. For example, if public attributions are used by elites to
frame our understanding of cyber conflict, the type of framing, and the
effect thereof are worthy of further study. This article focuses mainly
on this second part of the process, namely, what happens after an
incident is publicly attributed.]{.underline}

Schulzke (2018) has suggested some theoretical reasons why we should pay
careful attention to the effects of public attribution of cyber
incidents. Drawing on psychological research, he argued that people do
not like ambiguity when searching for explanations of unexpected
threatening events (p. 957). In the attribution of cyber incidents, the
relatively long time-frame between the event and a confident attribution
statement results in people already having drawn their own conclusions,
before "better" information may be available. Schulzke draws out four
theoretical mechanisms particularly poignant for public opinion
formation of attribution of cyber incidents. First, due to the
information poor environment, causal narratives offered by elites gain
large weight in media coverage (Baum & Groeling, 2010; Bennett,
Lawrence, & Livingston, 2007; see also Stone, 1989). This effect is
stronger in the cyber environment compared to kinetic incidents, as in
many cases the victim has the ability to keep the occurrence of a cyber
incident a secret. Second, existing hostilities influence subsequent
threat perception, with attributional uncertainty having the potential
to reinforce current strategic narratives. Schulzke argues that this,
again, is particularly exacerbated compared to kinetic attacks, as
evidence is harder to grasp and attribution, in general, is more
ambiguous resulting in even stronger power of initial framings of blame
(p. 959).

Third, information about cyber incidents is regularly not forthcoming,
reinforcing the perception of hidden processes and making cyber attack
causal narratives very similar to conspiracy theories (i.e., "a proposed
explanation of some historical event (or events) in terms of the
significant causal agency of a relatively small group of persons-the
conspirators-acting in secret." Definition from Keeley, 1999; see also
Schulzke, 2018, p. 962). Fourth, because of time delays in attribution
processes it is hard to hold policymakers accountable. In addition,
because cybersecurity as policy issue is distributed amongst different
stakeholders, responsibility is diffused and susceptibility to
partisanship increases. From these four mechanisms, Schulzke (2018)
concludes,

> the public should be sensitized to the problem and to a security
> context in which blame takes time to establish. It would be prudent
> for policymakers and journalists to avoid a rush to judge who is
> responsible for an attack, regardless of how obvious the answer may
> initially seem. This would promote greater openness to information
> that is uncovered by investigators. Political scientists can play a
> role in this by exploring how these novel threats fit into what
> previous research has uncovered about opinion formation and conflict
> processes. Future research should continue to investigate the
> political challenges associated with attribution and to consider what
> additional steps could be taken to manage this problem. (p. 964)

Agreeing with the desirability of Schulzke's prescriptions, and
following his call for more research in this area, this article
introduces a set of arguments beyond the four mechanisms raised.
Schulzke mostly draws on psychological, opinion formation, and media
research, arguing about the attribution environment in abstract. This
article contributes another element: contestation of public attribution
claims and the consequences such contestation brings. To do so, the
article first introduces factors skewing the public discourse on cyber
conflict. This is an important reflection in order to contextualize our
knowledge of cyber conflict. Second, the drivers of contestation after
an incident is publicly attributed are discussed, with particular focus
on how contestation is partially driven by the attacker and partially by
other constituencies with various political and economic motivations.
This has consequences for the opinion formation processes. Third, the
article concludes drawing out the likely consequences for the overall
discursive environment in public attribution, and recommends a changed
role for academic interventions in this space. Only few places in the
world have specialized programs to perform interdisciplinary research on
cybersecurity and international relations. While outliers exist (see
research of the Citizenlab; for a different example see Demchak &
Shavitt, 2018), a sustained academic engagement with the process that
produces the realities of cyber conflict and an active positioning
within that is sorely needed.

A skewed (public) picture of cyber conflict

To better understand the consequences of governments and private actors
publicly revealing the perpetrators behind cyber campaigns, we need to
understand the biases underlying the data and judgements made. Those
biases in the data and judgements will shape our knowledge space on
cyber conflict. There are at least two operational, and three structural
factors that jointly skew our picture of cyber conflict.

The first two factors are operational. First, offensive actors hide
their tracks. The actors engaging in offensive behavior often have
incentives to hide their tracks to achieve their goals. Thus, the
attackers may sometimes be the only ones knowing they are engaging in
offensive behavior. Of course, some actors want to advertise the origin
of cyber activity broadly, but this remains the minority of publicly
known incidents (Poznansky & Perkoski, 2018). Second, the victims often
have incentives to keep their victimhood secret, limiting the amount of
information we have about the impact of cyber conflict. This is both due
to operational and reputational reasons: Operationally, it can be
advantageous to not disclose your knowledge to the attacker;
reputationally, organisations may come to the conclusions that it is
better not to disclose having been breached.

There are three structural factors that further skew our public
knowledge of cyber conflict. First, the security companies, which are
one of the main sources of how we learn about cyber conflict, have
limited visibility, mostly defined by the technologies employed and the
markets they serve. Furthermore, they have a specific prism of what
kinds of threats they investigate further (on the political choices made
by security companies, see Stevens, 2020). That prism results in highly
detailed knowledge about a subset of actors engaging in offensive
measures. Only a subset of the research on these investigated actors is
then published and picked up in the public's awareness of cyber
conflict. In addition, most of the companies investigating threats
(threat intelligence companies) are based in Western states---though
this is changing, for example, with China-based threat intelligence
teams increasingly reporting on threat activity within China (one
example is Qihoo360). Partially due to their client base, partially due
to political sensibilities, and partially due to different political
priorities resulting in a different target set, threat intelligence
companies rarely publicly reveal Western operations (for an analysis of
threat intelligence reporting focusing on civil society, see Maschmeyer,
2019).

Second, there exists an attribution asymmetry. The rights and
responsibilities of governments and private actors are still in
political dispute. This means, there still is a lacking baseline on who
has to provide security for whom, and for what price, in what
circumstance (see Dunn Cavelty & Egloff, 2019). The result is highly
unequal investments with regard to whom attribution capabilities are
used for: The financially potent have the means to buy attribution,
whilst some of the political targets have the public visibility for
security companies to show off their skills. Outside of those two
categories, most organizations and citizens never get in contact with an
attribution investigation. Third, recently, some governments, most
prominently the members of the Five-Eyes signals intelligence alliance
(consisting of the United States of America, United Kingdom, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand), have started to publicly attribute some
cyber intrusions. Governments, however, have their own, politically
derived incentives to publish some results of investigations and not
others.

The political motivations behind public attributions, coupled with the
scarce evidence offered for the attribution judgements, skews our
knowledge of cyber conflict. Because of the operational factors leading
to underreporting, the commercial incentives on the private sector side,
and the political bias on the government side, the public data about
cyber conflict structurally induces distrust into the representativeness
of the attribution statements made by these actors. However, due to the
secrecy of the cyber incidents, the knowledge introduced in to the
public domain by these actors is key in providing the discursive
baseline for contestations about cyber conflict.

The remainder of this article focuses on this understudied element: The
contestation phase that follows a public attribution. This phase is
important, as by introducing attribution claims into the public
discourse, actors are laying political blame for specific actions onto
other actors. The next part shows how different actors are challenging
these political acts in a contested information environment.

Contested public attributions in democracies

Contestation of the attribution offered by a government regularly
follows attribution statements. This part focuses on this contestation
phase, and the implications contestation has on the perception of cyber
conflict, and the trustworthiness of attribution claims by society.

Contestation is fundamental to democratic politics (see, for example,
Dryzek, 2002). The open debate, the ability of everyone to freely voice
opinions, and the emergence of truth trough democratic discourse is
foundational to the public sphere of democratic polities. Thus, the
ability to contest is a sign of healthy democratic politics, or, in
Dryzek's terms: "Contestation is democratic to the extent that it is
engaged by a broad variety of competent actors under unconstrained
conditions" (p. 77). Thus, ideally, there are a broad set of competent
actors participating the contestation in the public sphere. As the
series of empirical examples in this section will show, however, whilst
the discourse on public attribution is generally open to contestation,
the problems raised with the actors (see above), coupled with the
information poor environment about cyber incidents to the broader
public, creates particular opportunities for motivated, sometimes
adversarial, intervention in the area of cybersecurity.

In abstract, there are different phases that contestation occurs within.
At some point in time, an intrusion is discovered by the victim. The
fact of the existence of the intrusion may, but does not have to, leak
into the public domain. If it does, public contestation around who might
be behind the intrusion starts at that point. If it does not,
contestation starts the latest with the first public statement
attributing the intrusion.

Contestation is undertaken by several different communities and is
case-specific. As a generalized matter, contestation will depend on the
type of evidence that the attributor offered. The government has some
choice over whether, and how much to reveal. Thereby, trade-offs have to
be made on how much detail is revealed: revealing more detail is giving
the attacker more insight into the governmental processes, particularly
with regard to sources and methods. Concealing the incident entirely
runs into the risk of not being in control of the narrative, should the
fact of the existence of the incident leak. Revealing part of the
incident, but not others, opens up contestation as to the credibility of
the evidence. Overall, the less clear the matching between the evidence
disclosed and the conclusions proffered, the more opportunity there is
for antagonistic communities to introduce doubt unto the claims made.

This does not mean that all claims always have to be supported by public
evidence: Indeed, we trust other people's claims based on trust in their
person, their procedures, or their institutions all the time, often
based on a common sense, that is, "our acceptance of the intractable
facts about the world and our already existing shared experience and
understanding about the social world" (Muirhead & Rosenblum, 2019, p.
127). However, with regard to the attribution of cyber incidents, there
is not yet a wealth of shared experience and understanding to draw upon,
let alone intractable facts, opening up the space to fundamental
contestation.

In this contestation process, the attacker is able to influence the
contestation. Hence, the attacker can offer alternative interpretations
vying to persuade the same audiences the victim wants to convince. As
such, Guitton (2014) was right when he cast public attribution as a
"game to convince an audience." We now have evidence that different
actors actively engage in this type of contestation, and that some of
the actors are becoming more skilled at it. This can be best observed
using empirical examples. For this reason, to illuminate the
contestation phase of public attribution, the article observes some
short empirical examples of contested attributions.

The universe of cases of public attributions in democracies is growing,
with my current research project on the politics of public attribution
already having identified around 50 cases across Western Europe and
North America (Center for Security Studies, n.d.). The empirical
examples included in this article are selected, because they are
particularly instructive to observe the contestation phase, and to see
the development of government policy to address some of the challenges
of engaging in public attribution.3 The Sony attack in 2014 is one of
the earliest examples, where a government publicly blamed another
government for a cyber incident, and tried to convince its audience by
offering up evidence. It is particularly instructive, as it shows the
contestation that can occur domestically, when a government claims
attribution. The DNC case of 2016 is one of the (rare) examples, where
we have corroborated public documentation of the adversary directly
engaging in countermessaging, trying to muddy the attribution claims
offered by the private sector and government. It adds empirical
illustration to the phenomenon of contestation by demonstrating the
active nature of some adversaries in interfering in (domestic) political
discourses. Finally, the NotPetya case of 2017/8 is one of the newer
cases where a new policy of diplomatic collaboration to address the
problem of not being able to share all the evidence is observable.
Governments, recognizing their trust deficit in claiming attribution in
public, have teamed up with other governments to lend more political
weight and credibility to their claims: The NotPetya case illustrates
this well.

Cyber intrusion at Sony Pictures Entertainment 2014

On November 24 2014, a wiper malware was activated on a large part of
SPE's infrastructure, crippling the company's ability to continue their
work. The malware issued a warning that company documents would be
released if demands were not met by 11:00 at night. Having let that
deadline pass, the group Guardians of Peace (GOP) published several
movies, SPE internal documents, and e-mail archives of SPE executives
over the next month, thereby alerting the public of the intrusion at
Sony Pictures Entertainment.

Given the upcoming release date of the movie The Interview, speculations
about possible North Korean connections were raised. North Korea reacted
by issuing a press statement denying responsibility, but praising the
attacking group for their actions and condemning SPE for producing a
film "abetting a terrorist act" (KCNAWatch, 2014). This was followed by
a statement by GOP on December 8 2014, which directly connected the
showing of a movie to their actions. It demanded that SPE should "stop
immediately showing the movie of terrorism which can break the regional
peace and cause the War!" (Gallagher, 2014).

Lacking any indications of canceling the movie, it was a threat of
terrorist attacks against moviegoers issued on the Pastebin platform on
December 16 2014 that changed the dynamic. Despite the U.S. Department
of Homeland Security's claim of having no intelligence about a plot
against movie theaters, many movie theaters opted-out of showing the
movie (Perera, 2014; Seal, 2015; United States Department of Homeland
Security & Federal Bureau of Investigations, 2014). The next day SPE
issued a press statement canceling the release, which had been scheduled
for Christmas Day. By that time, the public discourse in the United
States was still focused on whether it could really be North Korea
behind the intrusion. For example, on the December 17, Kim Zetter, a
renowned journalist covering information security, in an article
weighing up different theories concluded: "Regardless of whether the
Sony, Saudi Aramco and South Korea attacks are related, the evidence
indicating they're nation-state attacks is circumstantial. And all of
the same evidence could easily point to hacktivists. Our money is on the
latter" (Zetter, 2014).

On December 18 2014, the White House announced it was considering a
proportional response (White House, 2014). On December 19 2014, the FBI
officially attributed the GOP's actions to the North Korean government
(FBI, 2014). The same day, U.S. President Barack Obama confirmed the
attribution to North Korea (Obama, 2014). The FBI did not offer specific
evidence, but explained that their judgement was based in part in
overlap of previously used malware, infrastructure, and tools used in
previous attacks carried out by North Korea. Some experts arrived at the
same conclusion. For example, Brian Krebs (2014) laid out in detail the
evidence why it is plausible for North Korea to be behind the intrusion.
Similarly, Nicholas Weaver (2014) explained why the U.S. government is
credible in claiming North Korea provenance. Bruce Bennet (2014) of RAND
explained how this fits within the larger North Korean political and
security context. And finally, Dmitry Alperovitch (2014) of Crowdstrike
asserted that his company's own assessment supports the attribution to
North Korea.

However, this did not assuage the skeptics. The generic language used by
the FBI led to skeptical statements from some information security
specialists. For example, Robert Graham (2014) entitled his blog post
"The FBI's North Korea evidence is nonsense," whilst Marc Rogers (2014a,
2014b), DEFCONs head of security, published two contributions explaining
his doubt of the FBI's attribution claims.

Bruce Schneier (2014) entitled his December 24 blog post "Did North
Korea really hack Sony?" and voiced his deep skepticism of the North
Korea attribution. By the December 26 2014, NPR featured a segment on
"Doubts Persist On U.S. Claims Of North Korean Role In Sony Hack"
(Shahani, 2014). Some people also used the skepticism of the Sony
attribution to feature their own companies. For example, Kurt
Stammberger of Norse Inc. and Jeffrey Carr of Taia Global both claimed
that their own company's analyses led them to different judgements
(Biddle, 2014; Taia Global, 2014). Thus, the original FBI/Obama
attribution was not convincing to parts of the security community, which
was used to see arguments to be supported with data, and which was
inherently skeptical of the use of government authority to give weight
to a truth claim. At the same time, the Russian government expressed
solidarity with North Korea on the film being "aggressive and
scandalous," and charged the United States with escalating tensions
without presenting direct evidence linking the intrusions to North Korea
(Lukashevich, 2014).

There was still much speculation about the provenance of the Sony
attack. So much so, that the then director of the FBI, James Comey,
released more details on the Sony attribution on January 7 2015 (Comey,
2015). In a speech at Fordham University, he informed the public that
one element they based their attribution on was an operational security
mistake, where the North Koreans forgot to mask their true IP addresses.
Immediately, this was challenged by skeptics. Kim Zetter (2015) at Wired
again covered the critics, this time leaving the last word to Richard
Bejtlich, who offered some context:

> I don't expect anything the FBI says will persuade Sony truthers. The
> issue has more to do with truthers' lack of trust in government, law
> enforcement, and the intelligence community. Whatever the FBI says,
> the truthers will create alternative hypotheses that try to challenge
> the "official story." Resistance to authority is embedded in the
> culture of much of the "hacker community," and reaction to the
> government's stance on Sony attribution is just the latest example.

Bejtlich was right. Some parts of the security community continued to
voice their skepticism. Particularly, Jeffrey Carr's Taia Global
followed up with a report alleging Russian hackers still being on Sony's
networks, and that this claim sheds doubt on the veracity of the U.S.
government's attribution (Taia Global, 2015; see also Pearson, 2015).
Carr's source offered as bona fides some documents that the hacker
claims to originate from the Sony network, which Carr tried to verify.
Problematically, Carr's source for this claim was a well-known Russian
hacker with self-claimed previous contracting relationships to the
Russian state (Best, 2019; Pearson, 2015). Of note: both Jeffrey Carr
and Kurt Stammberger have since left the cybersecurity industry
(Collier, 2018).

This empirical example shows some of the dynamics that occur in the
contestation of a governmental attribution claim. While the government
insists on its legitimacy to claim attribution without revealing sources
and methods, other audiences use this predicament for their own
argumentative strategies. Firstly, the perpetrator can contest the
attribution claim by denying sponsorship and demand proof for the
attribution claim. Secondly, skepticism of government authority will
fuel distrust in a governmental claim without the evidence being
offered.4 Thirdly, interested third-parties can use this situation to
influence the contestation, as had happened in the Sony case with the
Russian government aligning itself with the North Korean narrative. In
such a contested information environment, multiple "truths" will
continue to co-exist. For example, Seth Rogen, the director of the film
The Interview, claimed in 2018 that he still does not believe North
Korea to be behind the hack (Marchese, 2018). The U.S. government,
meanwhile, reinforced its attribution claim multiple times to gain
legitimacy, eventually resulting in a detail-rich criminal complaint of
a North Korean citizen (United States of America v. Park Jin Hyok,
2018).

Cyber intrusions into the Democratic National Committee 2016

The intrusions into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) before the
U.S. presidential election in 2016 are a second example for how
contestation of the attribution takes place in a politicized information
environment.

In April 2016, Crowdstrike was called to help with incident response for
the DNC. They discovered at least two threat actors were active on the
DNC networks, one had been there since at least summer 2015, the other
since April 2016. On June 14 2016, the DNC, together with the
cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike, publicly attributed the intrusions into
its networks to two separate Russian espionage groups, APT28 and APT 29
(or FancyBear and CozyBear in Crowdstrike's terminology). Immediately,
the media enquired whether Crowdstrike was right. Various other security
companies confirmed their findings, including Fidelis, ThreatConnect
(2016), SecureWorks (2016), and Mandiant (Kopan, 2016a; Nakashima,
2016).

Just as immediate was the attacker's reaction, which was later confirmed
to be the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (also known under its
former name GRU). On June 15 2016, they created a fake hacker persona
named "Guccifer 2.0" and attempted sowing confusion and doubt over the
attribution claim (United States of America v. Netyksho et al., 2018).
They claimed to have hacked the DNC and as bona fides offered documents,
which the hacker claimed to originate from the DNC network. Over the
next few months, the attackers used the Guccifer 2.0 persona to
distribute documents on the Democratic Party's campaign and to shed
doubt about the attribution to Russia. RT (2016), a Russian government
funded media network, immediately picked up on the content and the
contradictory claim of hacking provenance, and further distributed this
interpretation.

However, by late July 2016, the cybersecurity community had identified
parts of the broader Russian subversion campaign, including some of the
influence elements (Gioe, 2018; Rid, 2016a, 2016b, 2017). Information
security specialists and some journalists were quick to point out that
Guccifer 2.0 was likely a front of the Russian intelligence services.
Meanwhile, the U.S. government officially did not attribute cyber
intrusion at the DNC.5 Despite the broad sourcing and unusual clarity of
evidence, it took another month for members of the legislative to go
public (September 22 2016), and two months for the U.S. government to
release a meagre public statement by the executive (October 7 2016)
(Feinstein & Schiff, 2016; United States Department of Homeland Security
& Director of National Intelligence, 2016).

Despite this, Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump further
fueled the uncertainty about the origin of the leaked material by during
the first presidential debate on September 26 2016, implicating other
theories of provenance such as Russia, China, or a 400 lbs hacker
(Kopan, 2016b). This is important, as the presidential debates are
moments of highest political media exposure, and do lead to follow-up
media stories, giving the multiple theories of provenance angle a bigger
discursive platform. He continued to reiterate this position even after
the election. On the December 11 2016 he implied on FoxNews Sunday
interview with Chris Wallace that the intelligence community has "no
idea if it's Russia, or China, or somebody. It could be somebody sitting
in a bed someplace" (FoxNews, 2016).

Only by the beginning of 2017, the government released an intelligence
community assessment attributing various interference activities,
including Guccifer 2.0, to the Russian government (National Intelligence
Council (Office of the Director of National Intelligence), 2017). On
January 12 2017, the GRU again used the Guccifer 2.0 persona to dispute
the relationship to Russia. By alleging the falsification of evidence,
it further fueled speculation about other theories of provenance, which
continued to be covered by publications such as The Nation (Lawrence,
2017). In the end, the United States released a detailed indictment
assigning blame to the Russian military intelligence service (United
States of America v. Netyksho et al., 2018).

Much of the delay in the U.S. public response is explained by domestic
political concerns of the executive being seen to unduly intervene in
the election process. At the domestic level, the procedures were
underdeveloped and unprepared for a coordinated response between the
federal government and the state-based election officials. Inter-agency
discussions and indecisiveness about what to do next significantly
slowed down this process. For example, in August 2016, then FBI Director
James Comey drafted an op-ed publicly attributing the Russian activities
that was debated in the inter-agency process but was never published
(U.S. Office of the Inspector General, 2018).

The contestation of the provenance of the intrusions was enabled by this
lack of a public response. As a consequence, the use of the materials,
also by the traditional media, was less problematized, as there was no
governmental voice claiming illegitimate interference into the election.
This is consistent with research on the influence of elites on initial
framings, in its absence opening up space in the initial coverage of the
incident to the attacker's narrative (see for example Baum & Groeling,
2010). This effect will diminish over time, as the official narrative
settles (Bennett, Lawrence, & Livingston, 2006). However, because of the
uncertainties in this initial contestation, doubts on are going to
persist, and significant work on behalf of the government has to be
undertaken to gain credibility for its version of events. In the case of
the election interference in the United States in 2016, this included
the appointment of a special counsel, who brought detailed indictments
against Russian activity as well as published two reports on the outcome
of the investigation (Mueller, 2019).

NotPetya incident in 2017

Finally, NotPetya, a third empirical example, can demonstrate how the
meaning-making activities of governments have changed, partially, in
order to address the problem of not being willing to release clear and
convincing evidence in a timely manner in the public domain.

NotPetya was a severe destructive cyber campaign aimed primarily at
Ukraine on the June 27 2019. It employed a wiper worm, which caused
destruction worldwide. As with any large cyber incident, the question
quickly arose, who is behind this campaign. Pretending to be ransomware,
the worm itself displayed none of the elements a cyber criminal campaign
would entail. The Ukrainian security service soon claimed for the
Russian special services to be behind the attack (SBU, 2017). This claim
was reinforced by cybersecurity companies, who independently found
technical links between the NotPetya attack and the BlackEnergy group, a
group who was also associated to the previous attacks on the Ukrainian
energy grid (Cherepanov, 2017; Kaspersky Blog, 2017). Russia immediately
denied these allegations (Brewster, 2017). Thus, the matter rested in a
stand-off. This is until the Five-Eyes, the signals intelligence
cooperation between the United States, United Kingdom, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand, decided to publicly attribute the campaign
to the Russian military.6 Again, Russia swiftly denied the allegations
(Russian Embassy in the USA, 2018). However, the political momentum
behind this attribution differed from the Ukrainian response. The
British attorney general, Jeremy Wright (2018), outlined the reasoning:

> If more states become involved in the work of attribution then we can
> be more certain of the assessment. We will continue to work closely
> with allies to deter, mitigate and attribute malicious cyber activity.
> It is important that our adversaries know their actions will be held
> up for scrutiny as an additional incentive to become more responsible
> members of the international community.

This joint approach of the Five-Eyes was corroborated by the U.S. State
Department, which highlighted the importance of partners in buttressing
each other's attribution claims and responses (Office of the Coordinator
for Cyber Issues, 2018).7 Thus, the Five-Eyes governments had decided
that they use public attribution as a way of shaping the environment. By
building an international coalition, attributing blame publicly to an
actor for specific actions that are deemed undesirable to the
international community, the coalition of states is changing the
operational environment.

The intent, as outlined by the British government official, is to
establish boundaries for responsible behavior, respectively clearly
labeling the behavior deemed "irresponsible." Indeed, the United
Kingdom\'s hopes to attain benefits with pursuing public attribution
more broadly, including making cyberspace "more transparent as
counter-normative and destructive behaviour (i.e. Wannacry and NotPetya)
are attributed" leading to "greater stability in cyberspace as clear
lines of unacceptable behaviour are drawn," increasing the legitimacy of
attribution by undertaking attribution with allies, and using
attribution as a first step "to enable wider response options to impose
costs on the responsible actors" (UK government, n.d.). Thus, the
British government identifies its activities in public attribution as
boundary drawing behavior that gains more legitimacy as it is undertaken
in coalitions of states. Though an in-depth international legal analysis
is out of scope, one can also note, that by acting in coalition states
prepare the ground for establishing state practice, one of the sources
for international customary law (see further Finnemore & Hollis, 2019).8
This is in congruence with the literature on international norms: In
order for norms to be effective, norm violations have to be acknowledged
(Finnemore & Hollis, 2017; Miller, Nakashima, & Entous, 2017). The norm
shaping activity seems to be targeted at encouraging state actors to not
indiscriminately deliver effects.

What the years of experience with public attribution since Rid and
Buchanan's (2015) seminal article have shown that, contrary to their
suggestions, specificity in the data presented to support a public
attribution claim is not a necessity to advance such a claim
successfully. In the examples raised in this article (Sony, DNC hack,
NotPetya), the government did not readily offer up specific data to back
up their attribution claims. The Sony hack thereby is particularly
instructive: The pointing to declassified evidence actually weakened the
government's truth claim, as it enabled other commentators to find
alternative explanations for the particular data. In the DNC and
NotPetya case, the governments initially were able to build on the
private sector claims, and used the government's reputation of
possessing capable (signals) intelligence capabilities to convince some
audiences of the trustworthiness of their claims.

[Implications of contested public attributions for the role of
academia]{.underline}

Whilst the first section of this article reflected on the operational
and structural factors leading to a skewed picture of cyber conflict,
the previous section identified in three empirical examples the
contestation around the provenance of cyber intrusions. [This last
section reflects on where this leaves the knowledge space on public
attribution, and proposes how academia, if it became a competent
stakeholder in the contestation of the public attribution discourse,
**could partially remedy some of the problems identified.**]{.underline}

[The three empirical examples showed that public attribution takes place
in a contested information environment]{.underline}, with the attacker
also having a voice. Attribution claims are introduced mainly by two
sets of stakeholders: governments and cybersecurity companies. Whilst
cybersecurity companies provide technical data, forensic links, and
estimates about who might be behind a cyber intrusion, they are often
not the political entity laying blame on a specific attacker. In the
Sony case, Mandiant provided the incident response services to Sony, but
refrained from publicly attributing the incident. The DNC intrusions are
the exception, where Crowdstrike was asked by the DNC to go public with
specific attribution claims. In the NotPetya case, private industry
provided much of the remedy to the infection, and offered analysis
connecting the operation to previous campaigns, but refrained from
making political attributions. Rather, it was governments that, in a
coordinated manner, laid blame onto the Russian military.

[There are long-term ramifications stemming from attributions in such
contested information environments. First, the uncertainty about the
truth claims persist.]{.underline} Thus, even several years after a
specific cyber incident, there are people asking about whether we can
really know who is behind the incident. This is due to the original
event being clouded in this contested information environment, where the
multiplicity of narratives offered to the public create an impression
that one really cannot know who is behind a cyber incident. The secrecy
of the attribution processes thereby lays fertile ground for
conspiratorial thinking (Schulzke, 2018). This is beneficial to
perpetrators of cyber intrusions, who, despite implausible deniability,
can continue operating with relative impunity (Cormac & Aldrich, 2018).

Indeed, whilst not unique to the area of cyber incidents, the
destabilization of the perception of the achievability of attribution is
particularly impactful in an information poor environment, where outside
verification is difficult (For an example of the destabilizing an
official narrative laying blame onto a specific actor in a physical
incident, see Ramsay and Robertshaw's (2018) analysis of the narratives
proffered in the wake of the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal). For
democracies, thereby, secrecy surrounding the attribution processes
poses a particular challenge in this contested information environment:
Legitimacy of state action is dependent on it being explainable,
accountable, and ultimately transparent (even if in hindsight). [For
this democratic accountability, **the public should be able to get an
accurate understanding of the underlying conflict dynamics that the use
of public attribution is part of**]{.underline} (see also Nincic, 2003;
Nothaft, Pamment, Agardh-Twetman, & Fjällhed, 2018).

Second, the actors providing the attribution judgements are motivated by
political and financial incentives. The strongest cybersecurity policy
actors have, however, been (signals) intelligence agencies, who by
design are not very public entities. So far, only the United States
government has released how they approach attribution processes of cyber
incidents (Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 2018).
Traditionally, intelligence agencies have been the locus with the most
resources and abilities to pursue attribution processes at the state
level. The recent political use of their analytic work in public is
democratically problematic, as the underlying processes for reaching
their conclusions are kept secret, usually for at least thirty years.
The governments choose, based on political considerations, which
incidents to attribute publicly. Oversight bodies remedy some of the
trust deficit, though their remit is much wider than overseeing
attribution processes. Yet, state intelligence agencies remain one of
the main sources of information about cyber conflict.

Thus, the electorate is dependent on other sources of information that
can triangulate governmental information. Whilst governments may have
good reason for not disclosing their sources and methods, private sector
structurally does not provide a remedy, as it has its own structurally
induced incentives to be only partially transparent. Particularly,
claims made based on data gathered in customer engagements often legally
have to be cloaked in secrecy. As previously noted, structurally, we end
up with a lack of transparency both about the baseline of the actual
events as well as about how actors have reached their judgements about
the events. Similarly problematic are the trust issues associated with
cybersecurity companies. The politicization of the companies themselves,
as well as the selection of knowledge that they publicly produce, make
the establishment of trust in a country as well as across countries
challenging. [However, shared discursive spaces for trust in knowledge
about cyber conflicts across societies are much needed, particularly as
future conflicts are likely to rely on digital interaction to an even
higher degree than today.]{.underline}

Finally, academia, so far, has not been a remedy, as researchers use the
public record as the baseline for studying cyber conflict (see Valeriano
& Maness, 2014). In order for academia to be a check on the biases
introduced, it would have to establish itself as a trustworthy source of
data and interpretation. For that to happen, interdisciplinary knowledge
on attribution processes is required. For example, the ability to judge
a company report's attribution claims depends as much on the ability to
understand the data, the judgements made, and the hypotheses analyzed,
as it does to understand the specific company's access to the data it
may not make public, but rely upon, to make its analytic judgements.
Thus, there is a need for additional trustworthy sources of data and
interpretations of data. In addition, there exists a call for a less
elitist, more democratic access to attribution knowledge (Schulzke,
2018). One answer could be a network of distributed and regionally
trusted public knowledge-creators (as, for example, proposed by Deibert
in Solomon, 2018). [Universities may provide one such possible locus to
remedy the trust problem. Their strong rootedness in academic,
transparent, and peer-reviewed research affords them societal trust,
which other actors, due to their structurally induced incentives do not,
and possibly cannot, have. In addition, universities are well positioned
to be independent stewards of data and analytic methods. They can
transparently analyze, provide context, and integrate new phenomena of
digital conflicts into shared knowledge structures.]{.underline}

However, to be such sources of trustworthy information on attribution,
[universities have to engage, even more than today, in work across both
physical, disciplinary, and academic boundaries. They have to transcend
physical boundaries, as part of the trust problem is associated with
national political interests.]{.underline} A cross regional
collaboration therefore could ensure that, should national political
priorities taint a specific attribution process, other universities are
able to balance that process. They have to transcend disciplinary
boundaries, as attribution processes inherently draw on
multi-disciplinary knowledge. [Finally, they have to transcend academic
boundaries, as much of the data resides with]{.underline} governments,
companies, and civil [society]{.underline}. Thus, academics have to be
willing to collaborate across multiple entities to for their engagement
in attribution research. The outcome is in line with what Ronald J.
Deibert, the head of the CitizenLab at University of Toronto called for,
namely, "to empower civilian institutions in multiple countries with
resources and capabilities to do independent research on threats to
cyberspace in the public interest regardless of boundaries, and
regardless of whose national or commercial interests are concerned"
(Deibert, 2017). Should such a network of independent institutions with
capabilities in the attribution space exist, they could become a
stabilzing element in the contested information environment (see also
Eichensehr, 2019, 2020). Whilst universities are often accused to be
risk-averse institutions, in the context of research on attribution,
this would be an asset.

[4.1 Cybersecurity research, policy and practice face distinctive
challenges]{.underline}

[Research needs the right support to be effective in improving
cybersecurity policy and practice, and making digital systems more
trustworthy and resilient.]{.underline} Cybersecurity's distinctive
characteristics include its multidisciplinary, global reach,
and cross-sectoral interests. The research takes place across the
academic, commercial and government sectors, such that research policies
in all of these sectors will need to adapt.

To ensure future research funding decisions promote world-class work,
all research funders must take advantage of international peer review
and expertise. Since funding for academic cybersecurity research is
concentrated among relatively few major funders, it is particularly
important that those funders ensure their processes are rigorous.

**[Research can help level the playing field between attackers and their
targets by improving the tools and techniques at the disposal of
cybersecurity practitioners]{.underline}**. These improvements can best
be realised through ambitious challenge-led research.

[Cybersecurity research must cover the full spectrum of inquiry.
Discovery research will push fundamental cybersecurity **knowledge
forward**, while **clear links between research and practice are
needed** at the applied end of the spectrum.]{.underline}

The UK Government has committed to providing £1.9 billion over five
years for cybersecurity. Some of this funding will be allocated to
research. This funding enables the UK to pursue an ambitious research
agenda. To be successful, this agenda will need to have a strong
challenge-led element and to enable collaboration across sectors,
disciplines and countries. It will also need to support the digital
environment's ability to use the products of research and, in turn, to
feed back into the research agenda.

### Policy Research Good---NATO/Russia

#### Debates about NATO and Russia challenge cognitive biases.

https://www.duckofminerva.com/2021/03/confronting-biases-in-policy-engaged-research-the-case-of-nato-and-russia.html

[As early as middle school, we are teaching young minds to think
critically and notice bias when it inevitably arises in news and media.
Yet as academics, **there is an illusion that we are free from bias**
and conflicts of interests that permeate all other parts of the
world]{.underline}. To perpetuate [**this illusion only hinders policy
engagement** and deepens the divide between academics and
practitioners.]{.underline} PhD training addresses part of this problem
pretty effectively---by teaching us to consider alternative explanations
in depth, to articulate the limits of any given study, and to avoid
making sweeping statements about future developments that are
intrinsically unknowable.

However, [in light of a recent review of literature on NATO enlargement,
I ponder whether there is a critical strategy to be added to the
discourse]{.underline}. Antithetical to what we are taught at the
advanced level---to strive for objectivity--- academics should openly
acknowledge political commitments where they exist, because of course
they will exist. These political commitments can lead us to become
"stealth issue advocates," in the words of Roger Pielke, where social
scientists claim to be arguing from expertise but are in fact arguing
from a political position. And we may only be dimly aware of doing this;
the first victim of the deception may be the researchers themselves, in
terms of not recognizing their own biases.

This is not to suggest that researchers fail in general to approach
their topics with an open mind or that our political commitments cannot
change as a result of our research---ideally, they would. [But in the
area of NATO enlargement's hypothesized effects on the Russian regime's
conduct in recent decades, there is evidence that in striving for
objectivity, scholars actually just hide their biases rather than
incorporating them explicitly into the debate, which has in turn
undermined the quality of discourse. NATO enlargement is a particularly
good case through which to examine this issue because although the
biases are relatively subtle, they have had undeniable influence on the
conclusions scholars draw and the stridency of their
claims.]{.underline}

The early debate about NATO enlargement's likely effects on Russia
generally had various contours. Critics of enlargement to East Central
Europe in the 1990s, such as Michael Mandelbaum and George Kennan,
argued that it would incite Russian nationalism, elevate that country's
sense of humiliation and defeat, and lead to the dramatic worsening of
Russia-Western relations. Other skeptics downplayed Russia's objections
or potential capacities, finding fault with the policy instead on the
basis of its limited utility and high cost. Meanwhile, supporters of
enlargement, including yours truly, speculated that Russian domestic
politics would take their own course regardless of NATO actions or
concluded that NATO enlargement would be a productive hedge if Russian
revanchism resurfaced and/or a useful tool for stability, even if it
didn't. But early on, whether NATO enlargement would cause Russian
aggression, revanchism and heightened hostility with the West was
essentially unknowable.

So have we learned anything in the intervening decades about who was
correct? While the short answer is "no," this has not stopped committed
observers, myself included, from marshaling confirmatory evidence for
their side. On the surface, the debate over NATO's effect on Russia
takes the following form and reflects an update to the version outline
above. Critics of NATO enlargement, as of 2021, could plausibly argue
that NATO enlargement since 1999 had encroached on Russia's sphere of
influence, pushed Western forces up to Russian borders, and provoked
Russia into launching conflicts in Georgia and Ukraine. Meanwhile,
having fed Russia's sense of insecurity and encirclement, critics argue,
the leadership embarked on a series of ferocious domestic repression
measures, including poisoning, jailing or killing journalists and
opposition members, curtailing protest and severely limiting the free
flow of information. None of this was necessarily inevitable, this
reasoning suggests.

The other side of the argument insists, however, that the Russian regime
was riddled with corruption and was intent on covering it up.
Governments from Yeltsin to Putin very likely engaged in subterfuge that
resulted in the massacre of their own citizens to build support for
authoritarianism and relentlessly pursued imperialist ambitions,
regardless of the will or sovereignty of neighboring states. Whether
NATO enlarged or not, this argument goes, democratic endurance in Russia
was never likely. And given Russian and Central-East European history,
it was better to secure the small, vulnerable states to its west rather
than risk further curbs on their autonomy---or worse---infringements by
Russia.

[But beneath the surface, another debate was playing out---and this is
where consequential bias is revealed. While some scholars prioritized
relations between "major powers" (particularly Russia and the US in this
case), others were more concerned about guaranteeing the rights,
prosperity, and security of the countries in "Zwischeneuropa"---those
states sandwiched between Russia and Germany that had long been beholden
to large power rivalry.]{.underline} As two scholars, Goldgeier and
Shifrinson, concede themselves, [while they "agree on how to go about
evaluating the costs and benefits of enlargement," they nevertheless
"disagree on the merits of the policy because \[they\] place different
weights and assign different probabilities to those different
factors."]{.underline} And both the weights and probabilities depend
largely on the personal beliefs of the author.

It turns out that [the value judgments Goldgeier and Shifrinson point to
**permeate the literature without scholars being in direct dialogue
about how central those differences are to the conclusions they
draw**.]{.underline} On the side of privileging "great powers," Stephen
Cohen, for example, argued that after the break-up of the Soviet Union
in 1991, "the foremost goal of U.S. policymaking should have been a
Russia. . .that was prospering, politically stable, at peace and fully
cooperating with the U.S. on the most threatening international
problems". John Lewis Gaddis agreed, stating that among the most
important rules of foreign strategy was to "treat former enemies
magnanimously" and that NATO enlargement violated not only this basic
principle of diplomacy, but every other, as well. Mandelbaum's assertion
that the policy of enlargement was "largely irrelevant to the problems
confronting countries situated between Germany and Russia" mirrored
another sentiment in the literature, which was that East Central Europe
was not in the Western strategic interest to protect. As Dani Reiter
matter-of-factly pointed out, "The West did after all accept Soviet
annexation or domination of all of these states during the Cold War
without taking military action".

### Policy Research Good---Russia

#### Debates about Russia are good. Misperceptions [fuels interventions]{.underline} and [risks extinction]{.underline}.

AK)

[A critical examination of U.S. policy misfires in dealing with Russia
and its intentions and capabilities over the past several decades is
**long overdue**]{.underline}. Three factors largely account for this
problem. All of them continue to affect contemporary policymakers'
approach to a deeply troubled relationship with Moscow. [By unpacking
the analytical assumptions that underlie these misconceptions, President
Joe Biden's administration and other important policy players will be
**better equipped** to ensure that U.S. policy going forward is grounded
in the most realistic **understanding of the challenge** that Russia
poses and the right kinds of tools that the United States should use to
contend with it.]{.underline}

[The first factor is the lingering euphoria of the post--Cold War
period.]{.underline} For many Western observers, the collapse of the
Soviet Union and [the implosion of Russian power demonstrated the
permanent superiority of the United States. The perception that Russia's
decline was so deep and irreversible that it would no longer be able to
resist Western initiatives made it difficult to accept Moscow's pushback
against Western policies.]{.underline} [This was a particular problem
when the]{.underline} North Atlantic Treaty Organization [(NATO) pursued
several rounds of enlargement in the 1990s and early 2000s under U.S.
leadership. U.S. leaders ignored Russia's objections and
**underestimated the lengths** to which Russian counterparts were
prepared to go to secure the homeland against perceived
threats.]{.underline}

Second, [American policymakers and experts have long paid too little
attention to the drivers of Russia's external behavior. Russian threat
perceptions are part of an inheritance heavily shaped by geography and a
history of troubled relations with other major European
powers]{.underline}. They are compounded by the trauma of the loss of
its empire, the lingering ideology of greatness, and a sense of
entitlement based on its sacrifice in World War II. President Vladimir
Putin stokes all of them for domestic political gain.

Third, [U**.S. policymakers have not fully internalized the lessons** of
the two biggest crises of the Cold War---the Cuban missile crisis of
1962 and the Euromissile crisis of the early 1980s]{.underline}. In both
cases, [the Soviet Union went to great lengths to counter what its
leaders perceived was a unilateral U.S. threat to the Soviet homeland
that could not be tolerated.]{.underline} In 1962 **[they almost
triggered a nuclear war.]{.underline}** In 1987, they agreed to
eliminate an entire class of intermediate-range nuclear weapons to
secure the homeland from U.S. missiles. In both situations, U.S.
missiles deployed in Europe would deny the Kremlin the advantage of
strategic depth and decision time in a crisis. [The lessons of those
crises were ignored as anachronisms when NATO embarked on its eastward
expansion on the assumption that it would no longer need to worry
about]{.underline}, let alone maintain the necessary capabilities for
the territorial defense mission. After all, Russia was permanently
weakened. [When **Russia proved otherwise**, the alliance was caught by
surprise.]{.underline}

In another surprise for the United States and its allies, **[Russian
foreign policy has become increasingly assertive, adversarial, and
ambitious over the past decade]{.underline}**. [In the post-Soviet
space, the Middle East, Latin America, and parts of Africa, Russia has
deployed a diverse tool kit rich in hard, soft, and gray zone power
instruments to assert itself as a global power. Russian foreign policy
agility and even daring have repeatedly caught the West by surprise and
sparked fears of its return as a major threat to Western
interests.]{.underline} In reality, [Russian gains and tools used to
accomplish Moscow's objectives have not been all that impressive. But
**Russia has made up for it by capitalizing on mistakes** made by the
United States and its allies or moving into power vacuums left by
them.]{.underline}

Still, Russian muscle-flexing and agility in deploying its tool kit,
certain to be enriched as new and even more disruptive technologies
become available, will remain a top-tier challenge for the president and
his senior national security aides. [Russia will also remain a serious
national security concern for the United States because of its nuclear
arsenal and conventional and cyber capabilities---and because of the
U.S. commitment to NATO, which is locked in a tense standoff with
Russia, in close proximity to its heartland, for the foreseeable
future.]{.underline}

[Getting Russia right]{.underline}---assessing its capabilities and
intentions, the long-term drivers of its policy and threat perceptions,
as well as its accomplishments---[is essential because the alternative
of misreading them is a recipe for wasted resources, distorted national
priorities, and **increased risk of confrontation.**]{.underline}

In responding to this challenge, [it is important to set priorities and
differentiate between primary and secondary interests.]{.underline}
Europe is the principal theater of the East-West confrontation where
Russian actions threaten Western security. Beyond Europe, Russia's gains
have been considerably less than often portrayed and pose a less serious
challenge to U.S. interests.

[The continued tendency to dismiss Russia as a "has been" or declining
power whose bark will always be worse than its bite can lead to the
United States overextending itself, making unrealistic commitments, and
risking a dangerous escalation with the one country that is still its
nuclear peer competitor. The push to expand NATO without taking into
account the possibility of Russia reemerging as a major military power
was an example of such thinking]{.underline}, which is to be avoided in
the future.

At the same time, [the scope and scale of the threat that Russia's
global activism poses to U.S. interests will depend largely on how
Washington defines those interests in regions where Russia has expanded
its footprint over the past decade.]{.underline} A**[bsent a sober
assessment of Russia's gains]{.underline}** [and tools for power
projection]{.underline}, **[the United States will position itself to
needlessly chase after the specter of Russian expansionism in distant
corners of the world]{.underline}** **[where major U.S. interests are
not at stake.]{.underline}**

### Scenario Planning Good---Biotech

#### Scenario planning in biotech is good. It guides R&D, innovation, and risk analysis to produce effective future tech.

innovation potential of ongoing biotechnological
research]{.underline}**. We also propose a model to further increase
open innovation between academia and the biotechnology value chain to
help fundamental research explore discovery fields that have a greater
chance to be valuable for applied research.

Developing Scenarios for Biotechnology in Complex Social Systems

[Biological science is expanding its knowledge frontiers at an
ever-accelerating pace. The progressing insights into biological
processes offer a broadening array of options to develop incremental and
differential innovations across the medical, agricultural, and
industrial biotechnology sectors.]{.underline}

As timelines from understanding basic biological processes to the
conception of an innovation and the development of a marketable product
may range from 10 to 25 years, a prime question for today's
biotechnology discovery research is 'innovation for what future world?'
(Figure 1).

[In the coming 15 years, the market will be served by R&D that is
performed today.]{.underline} Different biotechnology sectors address
changes in demand by repositioning and emphasizing what is in today's
pipeline[. New R&D and public research ideally address the demand of the
future market]{.underline}. **[Scenario analysis is well suited to
narrow down the most promising fields of investigation and to address
the unmet needs of future markets.]{.underline}** Abbreviations: R,
research; D, development.

To this end, [in 2019, we conducted a first-of-its-kind scenario
analysis with a 2050 time horizon to understand the option space of
agricultural biotechnology]{.underline}.i Forty-five [trends and 22
uncertainties dealing with the entire agricultural socioeconomic system
were reviewed to map the range of directions the future may take and to
narrow down how agricultural biotechnology could best future-proof food,
nutrition, and health security. Trends ranged from consumer and
demographics, farming and technology to politics, economy, and societal
developments while identified uncertainties were clustered around three
themes: needs for adaptation, priorities in the value chain, and the
role of science]{.underline} (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Trends and Uncertainties.

Trends are considered developments going in a certain direction, while
uncertainties can determine distinct outcomes with very different
implications. Here the two most extreme ways that the uncertainties
could play out are presented. Examples of specific uncertainties
clustered around three more general themes are provided in the footnote.
The exercise delivered four contrasting learning scenarios by detailing
out specific aspects of possible future worlds and making them as
concrete and vivid as possible (Figure 3). As the selected trends and
uncertainties deal with society, environment, innovation, and policy,
the learning scenarios helped to characterize implications not only for
the future of agriculture in Europe, which was the initial scope of the
scenario building, but they can also serve to aid decisions on future
research and innovation (R&I) investments in other fields of
biotechnology globally. Abbreviations: AI, artificial intelligence; AR,
augmented reality; NBT, new breeding technique; VR, virtual reality.

In order to identify toward which scenario today's world is heading,
relevant indicators need to be developed \[1,2\]. For this, the critical
developments or events that will be necessary for a scenario to arise
need to be named, put in a chronological order through narratives, and
checked for their informative value. Learning scenarios are reusable,
and the scope of the indicators identified will depend on the diversity
of expertise within the team exploiting the learning scenarios (Figure
3). Obvious examples of indicators are the developments around the
legislation related to gene editing in the Bio-innovation and REJECTech
scenario or personal data protection regulations in the My Choice
scenario, while for instance the evolution of water availability in a
particular country can be an indicator for Food Emergency, as well as
for Bio-innovation or REJECTech.

biotechnology]{.underline}. **[Bio-innovation]{.underline}**:
[Biotechnology solutions are intensively used and sustainably provide
sufficient high-quality food and large-volume feedstock for a thriving
bioeconomy]{.underline}; **[My Choice]{.underline}**: [Health and
sustainability concerns drive all sectors to be diverse and
transparent]{.underline}; meeting the needs and preferences of
individuals, personalized medicine, and nutrition are the norm;
**[REJECTech]{.underline}**: [Consumers have little trust in
politicians, scientists, and big industry.]{.underline} Society is
highly polarized and rejects biotechnology-derived products and
services, [despite dissatisfaction about missed opportunities, such as a
broad adoption of the bioeconomy due to limited agricultural
production**; Food Emergency**: Due to severe environmental degradation,
the world is struggling to fulfill basic food demand]{.underline}. In
response to the crisis, global adoption of innovation, including
biotechnology, occurs to mitigate impacts.

**[Steering Focus in Biotechnology Discovery Research with
Scenarios]{.underline}**

[The way the world will evolve will depend on a myriad of
developments]{.underline}. Examples are the transition to renewable
energy and decentralized storage, [the global policy approach to enable
the use of new genomic technologies, patients embracing new treatments,
society buying into preventive medicine or demanding transparency about
food properties, dietary shifts, development of new high-tech materials,
shifts in lifestyle, and progress in robotics and artificial
intelligence. **Following such developments and extrapolating their
long-term impact on the way we live may inspire scientists to take a
translational step and to open avenues of biotechnology discovery
research that would provide the starting basis for research and
innovation (R&I) addressing future needs**]{.underline}.

Biotechnology discovery research will undoubtedly be at the core of
numerous innovations that will reach society by 2050. [However,
depending on how the future will unfold, today's progress in
biotechnology research has a greater or lesser potential to be the basis
of subsequent innovation]{.underline}. In addition, the lack of a
widespread open innovation culture between industry and academia
increases the risk of missing out on innovation that trend-wise is
likely to meet industry or consumer demand.

For example**[, it is clear that the demand for climate change-related
biotechnology innovation will be high, and will be supported by policy
makers]{.underline}** \[3,4\]. However, [what the unmet needs will be
for the different stakeholder groups is still unclear. Effects on
cities, gardens, parks, lakes, and crop fields linked to shifts and
volatility in weather and the resulting new environmental conditions,
including new pests and diseases, are not yet fully
appreciated.]{.underline} Consequently, a translational step from
innovation opportunity to required new knowledge is not obvious.
Similarly, it is not clear how to incorporate innovation into products
\[5\]. It may range from gene editing to novel knowledge-driven,
societally accepted workflows that are not yet in place. The first
activity, developing climate change know--how, has a low risk of not
being of relevance. The second, **[developing biotechnology innovation
addressing climate change, is dependent on how policies develop across
the globe]{.underline}**, and therefore carries a higher risk \[6\]. For
example, whereas [it is conceivable in a bio-innovation world that
society may see a broad replacement of fossil-based synthetic materials
by bio-based alternatives,]{.underline} such a development is less
likely to occur in a REJECTech setting, as although the know--how to do
so would exist, the technical enablement would not be supported.

Another example relates to **[the exploitation of the
microbiome]{.underline}**. As [microbes impact]{.underline} most, if not
all, complex ecological systems, exploitation of biological know--how is
expected to offer [innovation options in a broad range of biotechnology
fields and be at the core of new markets and business
models]{.underline}. **[These may include medicine, health care, food
systems, industrial and household processes and materials, resource
recycling, and energy capture]{.underline}**. For this to become
reality, [broad fundamental biotechnology discovery research on
microbiomes needs to reach a tipping point, so that R&I for smaller and
bigger opportunities across sectors becomes viabl]{.underline}e \[7\].
This necessitates a major public effort to advance precompetitive
know--how and an enablement to a level sufficient for sector adoption
within a reasonable risk perspective on a return of investment. A
flagship approach in, for example, medicine building on ongoing big data
efforts, such as in the human '100K genomes project'ii, may serve as a
vehicle to reach, in a 5-year time span, the desired state of enablement
and allow smaller initiatives to build on this cost-effectively.
However, [an entrepreneurial ecosystem is critical for this to happen,
implying that such developments are more likely to occur under a
Bio-innovation scenario or even in a Food Emergency scenario, once
society starts prioritizing access to food and health]{.underline}.

A third example refers to diet shifts toward alternative protein
sources. Consumer choice strongly depends on food properties such as
taste, texture, palatability, color, convenience, and price. Making
alternative protein products competitive to meat would require, among
other improvements, major advances in biological insights to upgrade
food sources \[8\]. The challenge is to get specific on the carriers,
such as algae, insects, crops, fermentation, and so on, and the exact
properties, so that the investments in biotechnology discovery have a
practical effect. How to do this successfully is not obvious as it is
currently not clear which products and product properties will match
future market demands. This re-emphasizes the importance of contrasting
learning scenarios and the need to identify scenario-specific indicators
to get insights early in time about how particular trends are panning
out. These indicators may relate to yes/no decision points in policy
development, or the timely establishment of critical enabling
technologies or of sizeable consumer demands. Tracking progress of
multiple, scenario-specific indicators thus helps to steer focus in
discovery research and to emphasize or de-emphasize timely manner to
maximize the chance for successful innovation.

**[A current real-life example is the COVID-19]{.underline}**
(coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, an occurrence that was not foreseen
because of which only relatively small and scattered efforts of research
have been conducted prior to the pandemic. **[The current R&I race to
develop a cure and vaccine against COVID-19 would have greatly
benefitted from an advanced knowledge on coronaviruses, obtained through
biotechnology discovery research]{.underline}** \[9,10\]. Of course, in
hindsight it is easy to highlight what should have been done. In
practice, there are several million viruses in the world, over 200 of
which are known to infect humans. Conducting extensive research on all
these viruses in parallel would be too labor-intensive and unsustainable
from an economical point of view. However, **[the current crisis reveals
the advantage in time the use of scenario indicators can offer to
international and local organizations dealing with public
health]{.underline}**. Such [indicators might have flagged previous
smaller outbreaks of other coronaviruses such as SARS]{.underline}
(severe acute respiratory syndrome) [and MERS]{.underline} (Middle East
respiratory syndrome) [in the past two decades. These outbreaks could
then have been predictive for scenarios in which coronaviruses would
become a major threat to human health, and could have triggered
dedicated funding to advance specific biotechnological know--how, as
well as to develop strategies to minimize the spread of this type of
disease]{.underline}. Major funding is currently being gathered to
mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis, including \$8 billion
pledged by world leaders to support dedicated R&Iiii. However, today's
continuing need to conduct significant biotechnology discovery research
means that time, not necessarily funding per se, is a bottleneck. Along
the same lines, **[developing scenarios today to understand how the
future may unfold in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic could help
anticipate the long-term consequences of the actions that are being
taken and could allow countries, states, and communities to react to the
crisis more effectively]{.underline}**. In the context of the scenarios
presented in Figure 3, the current pandemic emerges as a relevant
indicator for the Food Emergency scenario. A global economic crisis may
put critical agricultural supply chains at risk, such that food security
becomes an even greater issue in certain world regions.

#### Scenario-based approaches to biotech analyze innovation and ethics. That identifies costs and benefits of technology and considers ethical questions.

[Technology Assessment (TA) to Ethical Technology Assessment
(eTA)]{.underline}

Alongside the PP[, technology assessment (TA) is one of the best-known
methods of dealing with uncertainty]{.underline} (Mittelstadt, Stahl,
and Fairweather 2015). Grunwald (2020) notes that because [TA is not
focused on technologies that actually exist]{.underline} yet, **[it is a
method that "creates and assesses prospective knowledge about the future
consequences of technology," through evaluating and scrutinizing "ideas,
designs, plans, or visions for future technology"]{.underline}**
(Grunwald 2020, 97; Grunwald 2019). He further notes that participatory
[versions of this speculative evaluative process are less about
imagining technologies per se, and more about envisaging future
technologies as situated in a specific "societal
environment"]{.underline} (Grunwald 2019). The inputs for analysis are
thus "models, narratives, roadmaps, visions, scenarios, prototypes" etc.
(Grunwald 2020, 99). Mittelstadt, Stahl and Fairweather (2015) note
traditional TA arose in response to "undesirable or unintentional side
effects of emerging technologies" with a primary focus on considering
the impact of technology on "the environment, industry and society"
(1035). Its goal is to foster responsible regulation to maximize benefit
and prevent harm caused by advances in technology.

[While TA has been highly influential, particularly for establishing
environmental impact assessments and other forms of risk
analysis]{.underline}, Palm and Hansson (2006) claim [ethical and social
dimensions of emerging technologies have often been
neglected]{.underline} (546). They [propose the ethical technology
assessment (eTA) approach that adjusts development in line with ethical
concerns and guides decision-making]{.underline} (551). Their ethical
"checklist" contains nine items that, if implicated in an emerging
technology, indicate an eTA should be conducted. [Examples include if
the proposed technology might be expected to affect concepts of
"privacy" or "gender minorities and justice"]{.underline} (551). Brey
(2012) states the purpose of eTA is to "provide indicators of negative
ethical implications at an early stage of technological development ...
by confronting projected features of the technology or projected social
consequences with ethical concepts and principles" (3--4). Palm and
Hansson (2006) note that current obstacles to this process include fear
of the unknown, assumptions about the self-regulation of technological
development, and citizens feeling ill-equipped to engage in discussions
of technologies that are becoming increasingly complex (547). They
describe the result in terms of W.F. Ogburn's concept of "cultural lag,"
where technology, as an instance of material culture, is now released
into society before "non-material culture has stabilized its response to
it" (547). In other words[, social, ethical, legal, religious, and
cultural systems have not yet grappled with the implications of
technologies before they are unleased on society.]{.underline} Some of
these **[challenges are met by scenario-based approaches to emerging
technologies]{.underline}**, as demonstrated below.

**[Scenario Approaches]{.underline}**

While **[many scenario-based approaches to emerging technology ethics
overlap methodologically with eTA]{.underline}**, there are some
features that are worth discussing separately. Brey's (2012) account of
[the techno-ethical scenario approach]{.underline} describes it as
ethical [assessment that helps policymakers "anticipate ethical
controversies regarding emerging technologies" through analyzing
hypothetical scenarios]{.underline} (4). He notes a unique feature of
the method is that [it not only tries to predict what moral issues will
arise with the advent of new technologies but also how those very
technologies will impact morality and "the way we interpret moral
values"]{.underline} (4). Boenink, Swierstra, and Stemerding's (2010)
framework breaks this process up into three distinct steps: 1)
"[Sketching the moral landscape,]{.underline}" which provides a baseline
narrative from which the introduction of the new technology can be
compared; 2) "[Generating potential moral controversies]{.underline}"
using "New and Emerging Science and Technology" (NEST) ethics, with the
aim of predicting realistic ethical arguments and issues regarding
emerging technologies; and 3) "[Constructing closure by judging
plausibility of resolutions]{.underline}," where arguments and
counterarguments are considered in the light of the most likely
resolution to the issues raised in step 2 (11--13). [The process can
draw analogies to existing or historical examples of technological
change, and the ethical consequences involved, or construct specific
controversies and "alternative futures]{.underline}" (14). The most
important step to consider here is the second, of which Brey (2012)
states:

The NEST-ethics approach performs three tasks. First, [it identifies
**promises and expectations** concerning a new technology]{.underline}.
Second, [it **identifies critical objections** that may be raised
against these promises, for example regarding efficiency and
effectiveness, as well as many conventionally ethical objections,
regarding rights, harms and obligations, just distribution, the good
life, and others]{.underline}. Third, [it identifies **chains of
arguments and counter-arguments** regarding the positive and negative
aspects of the technology, which can be used to anticipate how the moral
debate on the new technology may develop.]{.underline} (4--5)

In this way**[, scenario analysis can consider how technology and ethics
change in tandem when new technologies emerge.]{.underline}**

[Socio-technical scenario approaches are similar to the techno-ethical
approach]{.underline} outlined above; however, according to Schick
(2019), they owe their origins to utopian studies and traditional
philosophical thought experimentation (261). Claiming they are now used
"as a form of moral foresight; an attempt to keep the ethical discourse
ahead of the technological curve," Schick (2019) suggests the goal of
socio-technical speculation is to "guide society toward morally sound
decisions regarding emerging technologies" (261). Thus[, the scenarios
being discussed are deeply embedded in hypothetical future
societies]{.underline}. The Collingridge dilemma is also noted as a
potential pitfall for this method, which the final technique covered
here tries to avoid through engaging anticipatory models of ethics and
governance.

**\[ABSTRACT\]**

[This article introduces political scientists to
scenarios]{.underline}---future counterfactuals---[and demonstrates
their value in tandem with other methodologies and across a wide range
of research questions]{.underline}. The [authors describe best practices
regarding the scenario method and argue that **scenarios contribute to
theory building and development, identifying new hypotheses, analyzing
data-poor research topics, articulating \"world views,\" setting new
research agendas, avoiding cognitive biases, and
teaching**]{.underline}. The article also establishes the low rate at
which scenarios are used in the international relations subfield and
situates scenarios in the broader context of political science methods.
The conclusion offers two detailed examples of the effective use of
scenarios.

**\[ABSTRACT ENDS\]**

In his classic work on scenario analysis, *The Art of the Long View*,
Peter [Schwartz commented that \"social scientists often have a hard
time \[building scenarios\]; they have been trained to stay away from
\'what if?\' questions and concentrate on \'what was?\'\"]{.underline}
(Schwartz 1996:31). While Schwartz\'s comments were impressionistic
based on his years of conducting and teaching scenario analysis, [his
claim withstands empirical scrutiny. Scenarios---counterfactual
narratives about the future ---**are woefully underutilized among
political scientists**. The method is almost never taught on graduate
student syllabi, and a survey of leading international relations (IR)
journals indicates that scenarios were used in only 302 of 18,764
sampled articles. The low rate at which political scientists use
scenarios---**less than 2% of the time**---is surprising]{.underline};
the method is popular in fields as disparate as business, demographics,
ecology, pharmacology, public health, economics, and epidemiology
(Venable, Li, Ginter, and Duncan 1993; Leufkens, Haaijer Ruskamp,
Bakker, and Dukes 1994; Baker, Hülse, Gregory, White, Van Sickle,
Berger, Dole, and Schumaker 2004; Sanderson, Scherbov, O\'Neill, and
Lutz 2004). [Scenarios also are a common tool employed by the
policymakers whom political scientists study.]{.underline}

This article seeks to [elevate the status of scenarios in political
science by demonstrating their usefulness for theory building and
pedagogy]{.underline}. [Rather than constitute mere speculation
regarding an unpredictable future, as critics might suggest, scenarios
assist scholars with developing testable hypotheses, gathering data, and
identifying a theory\'s upper and lower bounds]{.underline}.
Additionally, **[scenarios are an effective way to teach students to
apply theory to policy]{.underline}**. In the below, a [\"best
practices\" guide is offered to advise scholars, practitioners, and
students, and an argument is developed in favor of the use of
scenarios]{.underline}. The article concludes with two examples of how
political scientists have invoked scenario method to improve the
specifications of their theories, propose fa hypotheses, and design new
empirical research programs.

*Scenarios in the Discipline*

What do counterfactual narratives about the future look like? Scenarios
may range in length from a few sentences to many pages. [One of the most
common uses of the scenario method, which will be referenced throughout
this art to study the conditions under which high-consequence,
low-probability events may occur.]{.underline} Perhaps **[the best
example of this is nuclear warfare]{.underline}**, a circumstance that
has never resulted, but has captivated generations of political
scientists. For an introductory illustration, let us consider a very
simple scenario regard a first use of a nuclear weapon might occur:

> During the year 2023, the US military is ordered to launch air and sea
> patrols of the Taiwan Strait to aid in a crisis. These highly visible
> patrols disrupt trade off China\'s coast, and result in skyrocketing
> insurance rates for shipping companies. Several days into the
> contingency, which involves over ten thousand US military personnel,
> an intelligence estimate concludes that a Chinese conventional strike
> against US air patrols and naval assets is imminent. The United States
> conducts a preemptive strike against anti-air and anti-sea systems on
> the Chinese mainland. The US strike is far more successful than
> Chinese military leaders thought possible; a new source of
> intelligence to the United States---unknown to Chinese
> leadership---allowed the US military to severely degrade Chinese
> targeting and situational awareness capabilities. Many of the weapons
> that China relied on to dissuade escalatory US military action are now
> reduced to single-digit-percentage readiness. Estimates for repairs
> and replenishments are stated in terms of weeks, and China\'s
> confidence in readily available, but \"dumber,\" weapons is low due to
> the dispersion and mobility of US forces. Word of the successful US
> strike spreads among the Chinese and Taiwanese publics. The Chinese
> Government concludes that for the sake of preserving its domestic
> strength, and to signal resolve to the US and Taiwanese Governments
> while minimizing further economic disruption, it should escalate
> dramatically with the use of an extremely small-yield nuclear device
> against a stationary US military asset in the Pacific region.

[This short story reflects a future event that]{.underline}, while
unlikely to occur and vague to be used for military planning, [contains
many dimensions of political science theory]{.underline}. These include
the following: [what leaders perceive as "limited," "proportional,\" or
\"escalatory\" uses of force; the importance of private
information]{.underline} about capabilities and commitment; audience
costs in international politics; the relationship between military
expediency and political objectives during war; and the role of
compressed timelines for decision making, among others [purpose of this
article is to explain to scholars how such stories, and **more
rigorously developed narratives that specify variables of interest and
draw on data, may improve the study of IR**. An important starting point
is to explain how future counterfactuals fit into the methodological
canon of the discipline.]{.underline}

*Scenarios as Future Counterfactuals*

[Scenarios may be understood and applied through the existing and widely
published framework of counterfactuals]{.underline}. Political
scientists almost exclusive on historical counterfactuals, but [future
counterfactuals exist in the same logical space and offer additional
advantages to the discipline]{.underline}. Richard Ned Lebow, example,
one of the few IR scholars to enter this methodological domain
seriously, writes that \"[counterfactuals are \'what if statements,
***usually about the past***]{.underline} \[emphasis ours\]\" (Lebow
2000:551). While [such a definition leaves room to consider future
counterfactuals]{.underline}, Lebow focuses on historical ones in his
essay. Similarly, in *Counterfactual Thought Experiments in World
Politics*, editors Philip Tetlock and Aaron Belkin focus on historical
analysis in their counterfactuals \"best practices\" chapter although
they are not definitionally bound to the past. For them counterfactuals
are \"subjective conditions in which the antecedent is known supposed
for purposes of argument to be false\" (Tetlock and Belkin 199 6:4).
Another prominent figure in the counterfactual methods literature is J
Fearon, whose foundational work on the subject writes the future out of
the definition: \"counterfactuals make claims about events that did not
actually occur" (Fearon 1991:169). Similarly, while his arguments are
oriented toward the past, they are relevant for analyzing the future.
For instance, when Fearon speak hypotheses that may not be tested due to
a lack of historical data (thus requiring counterfactuals), his points
are logically applicable to the future---another realm in which the
desired data do not (yet) exist.

One author, Steven [Weber, is exceptional and articulates the
perspective of scenarios as future counterfactuals]{.underline}. In
Tetlock and Belkin\'s book, Weber writes of \"Counterfactuals: Past and
Future.\" Weber argues that [political scientists have a tendency to
treat history as overdetermined and, like Lebow, is skeptical regarding
what is considered a \"fact\" versus \"non-fact\" in historical
analysis]{.underline} (Lebow 2000:551). Scholars tend to think of past
counterfactuals as logically distinct from future counterfactuals,
according to Weber, because in the former case things have actually come
to pass. Weber argues that [past and future counterfactuals should be
considered logically equivalent]{.underline} (see Figure 1) (We
1996:277). A common goal of counterfactual historical analysis is to
manipulate one variable while trying to keep others constant. As Weber
points out, **[manipulating one variable in a complex system often
creates nonlinear consequences and interaction effects that are
difficult for researchers to discern]{.underline}**. The historical
counterfactual thus exists in the same logical space as a future
counterfactual there may be greater certainty regarding some boundary
conditions in the (the Earth existed with gravity, the US Government was
not overthrown in revolution, etc.), but much of this background context
may be reasonably assumed to be stable in the future. [In addition to
the reasonableness of such assumptions in probability terms, they are
also **methodologically sound**, because: (i) background conditions are
not dependent or independent variables of in in the research at hand;
and (ii) if background conditions change]{.underline}, such as with a
large exogenous shock, [political scientists are likely to ask
completely different research questions. Many other variables of
interest, such as those affecting the]{.underline}

![](media/image1.png){width="6.0in" height="1.5993055555555555in"}

Fig. 1. Counterfactuals in Time (adapted from Weber 1996)

[stability of political, economic, and social systems]{.underline}, are
just as tenuous in past counterfactuals as they are in future ones.

[If scenarios are counterfactuals about the future, they may be further
compartmentalized to **advance a methodological
discussion**]{.underline}. Following the leaders literature, we turn to
Tetlock and Belkin, who offer a categorization sch five categories of
counterfactuals: idiographic case studies (usually something like \"what
if the Black Plague had not hit Europe?\"); nomothetic, which \"apply
well-defined theoretical or empirical generalizations to well-defined
antecedent conditions\"; joint idiographic-nomothetic counterfactuals;
computer-simulation counterfactuals; and mental-simulation
counterfactuals (for example, abstract experiments that seek to identify
upper and lower bounds of theory) (Tetlock and Belkin 1996:6). [Observed
scenarios may be matched to these categories link the literatures. For
instance, future warfare and political narrative scenarios generally
fall into the joint idiographic-nomothetic category, theory-building
scenarios may be of any kind]{.underline} (the most abstract would fall
into the categories of computer or mental simulation), [and scenarios
inclined toward data generation/projection are largely idiographic. This
categorization **allows scholars to begin discussing scenarios within
the language of the existing counterfactuals literature.**]{.underline}

*Use of Scenarios*

An important starting point for the advocacy of the scenario method is
to how the approach fits into the political science discipline. This
article in the results of the first extensive survey of the use of
scenarios in peer-reviewed journal articles. This survey reviewed the
electronically searchable history of elven journals (18,764 articles)
and collected data on all articles that use that use the word
\"scenario\" (1,559).3 [Of these articles, a large majority (1,057) **do
not use the word \"scenario\" in a methodologically meaningful
way**]{.underline}; a quick rule of thumb for this coding is that an
article is discounted if it uses \"scenario\" in a manner
interchangeable with \"situation.\" For instance, an author writing
about the \"post-Cold War scenario,\" meaning the world after the fall
of the Soviet Union, is not using the word \"scenario\" in a
methodologically meaningful way. The use of the word \"scenario\" to
refer to *historical* counterfactuals also was not included in the
survey. The remaining 502 articles were coded along the following
criteria:

- Is the scenario a "future counterfactual"?

- If so, what kind of future counterfactual is it? Future warfare
  narrative, other political narrative, quantitative projection, theory
  developing, and/or theory extending?

- If the scenario is not a future counterfactual, what method is the
  author using the world "scenario" to refer to? Formal modeling, game
  theory, experimentation, or other?

- Is the scenario a "full" or "vignette" scenario?4

The survey found nine ways in which authors use the word \"scenario\" to
refer to a methodological approach. Of these, six are types of future
counterfactuals and thus within the scope of this study. The most
prominent is narratives regarding future warfare. The journal
*International Security*, in particular, has published a large number of
analyses of scenarios regarding nuclear war and proliferation and during
the 1980s published extensively on what a conflict between NATO and
Warsaw Pact forces might look like in Central Europe (Mearsheimer 1982;
Feaver, Sagan, and Karl 1997; Batcher 2004). Closely related are
political narratives, such as those regarding foreign policy (for
example, analyzing futures of an expanded European Union) or domestic
politics in a country of foreign policy interest (for example, exploring
the circumstances under which China may democratize) (Chen 2002;
Ye§ilada, Efird, and Noordijk 2006; Lyn 2007). Third, a small proportion
of articles analyzed how scenarios were used historical decision making,
but these were not themselves scholarly uses of scenarios (Gansler 1982;
Stoddart 2008). Fourth, a popular form of scenario analysis was coded as
theory extension, or the use of scenarios to demonstrate how process
could unfold (Marchetti 2009). Fifth, a small proportion were theory
development, or the use of scenarios to identify and understand causal
relationships (Reiter 1995). Finally, [scenarios are sometimes using
large data sets for quantitative projections of political trend these
scenarios, researchers extrapolate historical and contemporary numerical
data to create visions of the future and then assess the political
implications living in that kind of world (for example, the effect of
different rates natural resources, strain on state capacity due to
demography or disease, etc]{.underline}.) (McNamara 1977; Browne 20).

This baseline understanding of the use of word \"scenario\" in the
discipline leads to several additional insights. First, few scholars in
the discipline are writing about the implications of theory for the
future in a methodologically consistent and replicable way. Qualitative
methods to develop and validate theories rely almost exclusively on
history, for which there is some data, but which will

**\[TABLE 1 OMMITTED\]**

certainly be different from future political environments. Second,
scholars who systematically use future counterfactuals to evaluate
theory tend to be from the field of strategic studies. This is visible
both from the over-representation of security studies articles in the
survey results and the plurality of "future warfare" among types of
scenarios. Third, the surveyed literature demonstrated wide variation in
the quality of scenarios, and almost none of the articles that use
scenarios cite methods articles. Even articles focused on political
narratives and theory building generally fail to draw on the nearest
companion literature, that of counterfactuals, to improve the quality of
futures analysis.

"**Best Practices of Scenario Analysis"** \[The bolding is theirs\]

A common refrain among scenario methodologists is that the use of
scenarios should come naturally to anyone, as it is innate, such as in
humans\' ability to anticipate and fear their deaths. A reasonable
question to ask is, if this evolutionary advantage is omnipresent, and
people are thinking about future counterfactuals all the time (\"what if
I lose my job?\" \"what if my wife finds out I\'m cheating?\" \"what if
I win the lottery?\" and so on), then why bother spending time
discussing how to do it better? Should not political scientists be able
apply the sorts of thought experiments they have in every other boundary
of life to their scholarship?

An obvious answer to these challenges is that some scenarios are better
done than others, and their quality may be evaluated in the same ways as
other qualitative methods. A less obvious answer is that [political
scientists often actively see to turn off the speculative aspects of
their minds, focusing instead on \"being taken where the data go.\" This
is an important problem, because data on many important political
questions simply do not yet exist, and the state of the field would be
rather disappointing if scholars only focused on data-rich topics. This
is **nowhere more obvious than the study of nuclear weapons**; while
there are only two observations of nuclear explosions in war, the
potential for future uses is of the highest consequence]{.underline}.
More specifically, [there are zero observations of nuclear war through
accident or inadvertent outcomes of bureaucratic processes,]{.underline}
but influential works have demonstrated that [**speculation regarding
such outcomes is made plausible** through the data that are
available]{.underline} (Blair 1993; Saga 1995).

Practically all of the extant literature regarding how to do scenario
analysis stems from business literature (Chandler and Cockle 1982;
Georgantzas and Acar 1995; Ringland 1998; Ogilvy 2002). The foundational
work in the field widely regarded as Peter Schwartz\'s *The Art of the
Long View*. Schwartz wrote this book informed by his career of doing
scenario analysis in the private sector. It is assigned in the rare
academic courses that invite scenario analysis, given to civil servants
being trained on the scenario method, and is cited in the couple of
discussions of scenarios in political science (Weber 1996). Schwartz and
other authors from the business field have tailored their
recommendations to an audience conducting scenario analysis primarily to
improve decision making; that is, the authors have oriented themselves
to advising readers on how to have the best possible scenario
conversations.

In contrast, [this article offers best practices for scenarios dedicated
to the core interests of political scientists: **developing and
improving upon theory**]{.underline}. [Thinking about scenarios in
regard to theory]{.underline} building is not entirely distinct from
what the business literature seeks to accomplish, but [entails a
difference in emphasisis]{.underline}. Below, we have drawn on the
business literature, counterfactual methods work, and the authors\'
experiences using scenarios to tailor best practices advice. The core
scenario is an adapted version of Peter Schwartz's, which is also
recapitulated by Steve Weber in his related book chapter (Weber
1996:279-284).

*How to Build a Scenario*

**Determine what type of scenario to use** \[Emphasis theirs\]

As indicated in the preceding section of the article, scenarios are not
uniform in their emphasis on theory and empirics. Researchers ought to
choose the type of scenario using the scenario/counterfactual
characterization schema presented above and based on the research
question and dependent variable at hand. A quick rule of thumb is that
in the absence of theory, an obvious use of scenarios is to develop
theory, or at least to better understand the most important questions to
ask. In this regard, scholars may benefit most from idiographic scenario
vignettes used to spark a conversation about how the world could have
ended up in that place. For instance, a scholar generally interested in
space warfare may have few theories to work from, as most relevant
thinking has taken place in the policy community, and few in traditional
political science departments have considered the unique material
context of such competition. The data for studying space warfare do not
yet exist in a form usable for social science, and there are no general
theories. A researcher, therefore, may wish to write a vignette of a
future in which a breakthrough in a new space technology is (i) cheap,
(ii) fast, and (iii) on the verge of diffusion from a first mover to the
rest of the international system. **[Thinking through what must have
happened to arrive in such a world, and the social and political
consequences that follow, would help a scholar to set their research
agenda regarding this emergent security environment]{.underline}**. For
scholars with a theory in mind, the most obvious type of scenario to use
is joint idiographic-nomothetic. For instance, an economist seeking to
deduce the logical future from current macroeconomic theory would be
interested in a narrative that connects theoretical expectations with
observed signals in the economy to project a future five years\' hence.

**Deduce driving forces from the theory of interest, or in the absence
of theory, work backwards from a future story** \[Emphasis theirs\]

These \"drivers\" are the independent, intervening, and/or interactive
variables of interest to the researcher. The most common drivers in
scenario analysis are social, environmental, technological, economic,
and political forces. For the purposes of theory building and extension,
the drivers should be variables capable of taking on qualitative or
quantitative measures. This means that the upper and lower limits of
ordinal or continuous variables should be identified, and their maximum
and minimum values should be in the same unit. Categorical variables
should be clearly defined, exclusive, and finite. In the counterfactual
analysis literature, one may think of this as what James Fearon calls a
\"range of counterfactual variation\"; social and material contexts
provide boundaries to what alternatives are plausible (Fearon 1991:184).

For example, let us consider relative deprivation theory (in a
superficial way, with our apologies to Ted Gurr) (Gurr 1970). This
theory suggests that social instability follows from a group\'s
discontent when it wants something another group within the society has
(income, status, political access, etc.) and believes access to that
good is possible. A scenario that seeks to extend this theory to analyze
its implications in a particular society would have the relevant
independent variables of interest as key drivers. The most basic key
driver would be relative income in the society; the maximal value would
be an extremely high discrepancy between Groups A and B (in quantitative
terms, a value of 0 for some proportion based on indicators of wealth),
while the minimal value would be parity (a value of 1).

**Identify highly probable contextual conditions for the future
narrative** \[Emphasis theirs\]

In short, the contextual conditions are the assumptions and data (both
qualitive and quantitative) that are of interest for the scenario, but
that are drivers. This part of the scenario process asks researchers to
identify the of the social system of interest that they feel reasonably
confident about. The explicit identification of contextual conditions
usually does not include stating parts of the world that are extremely
unlikely to change, such as the existence of the United States, but may
well include assigning a value to something like the US force
disposition in the world. For instance, in a scenario seeking insight
into Middle Eastern politics, a large US military presence in the or a
diminished supply of oil may be considered relevant contextual
assumptions rather than independent variables. The independent
variables, assigned as of step two, might include something like the
distribution of democratic dictatorial regimes or binary coding of
states\' possession of nuclear weapons.

**Identify "critical uncertainties"** \[Emphasis theirs\]

[These are the low-probability, high-impact outcomes that may follow
from the theory, independent variables, and context]{.underline}. The
idea is to **[identify outcomes that may be logically deduced from the
theory, would have dramatic effects value of the dependent variable of
interest, and are plausible]{.underline}**. [The interest in identifying
critical uncertainties is to avoid surprise by anticipating
theoretically consistent low-probability outcomes]{.underline}. While
[critical uncertainties]{.underline} are generally regarded as important
for policymaking, we contend they **[are also import theory building, as
they demonstrate logical boundaries for a theory]{.underline}**. [When
outcomes seem highly counterintuitive, they may signal a theory\'s limit
such as within a particular region, or omitted variables.]{.underline}

**Sketch "plot lines"** \[Emphasis theirs\]

[Plot lines develop the central logic of a scenario]{.underline}. [They
connect the driver theoretical expectations of causation. This may be
done one at a time case of particularly important drivers, but most
scenarios should explain multiple drivers interact to create plot
lines]{.underline} (as in reality, there is no such as only one variable
changing at a time in a social system). As Peter Schwartz put it, \"in
most good scenarios, several plot lines intersect, just as a good film
includes several subplots. The scenario planner looks at converging
forces and tries to understand how and why they might intersect---then
extends that imagination into coherent pictures of alternative futures\"
(Schwartz 1996:138) devising a plot line comprised of multiple drivers
quickly increases the complexity of the scenario, and thus the range of
possible futures, [the process is nevertheless superior to an attempt to
be predictive by focusing on a narrow range of futures]{.underline}. In
terms of the counterfactuals literature, one may think of plot the
equivalent of \"principles,\" which link antecedents to consequents.

**Write the scenario** \[Emphasis theirs\]

Scenario methodologists tend to refer to the scenario process as an art,
not a science. Although this article seeks to improve the rigor of
scenario analysis, there is a basic truth in this statement, as there is
not a best way to write the resulting narrative. Scenarios also are not,
as mentioned, easy to replicate. In terms of best practices for theory
building, it is clear that the scenario should be explicit in its
identification of the theoretical expectations of interest, key drivers,
relevant contextual conditions, and hypotheses of how those drivers
interact to effect outcomes. This approach at least improves the
potential for replicating the scenario analysis, or minimally having a
clear understanding of points of disagreement should a peer question any
aspects of the variable choices, assigned values, or determined
probability distribution of possible outcomes.

**Generate a list of evidence and structures of evidence that one might
gather to assess the degree to which the social system of interest
comports with the scenario-based model, included disconfirming evidence
(Shwartz 1996:60).** \[Emphasis theirs\]

This is, in essence, [thinking about what kinds of data (measure of
interest) and structures of data would help researchers to understand
the probability distribution of generated futures and how the
distribution might change over time]{.underline}. It answers such
questions as, is one identified more likely due to an increase or
decrease in the value of on independent variables? [This stage improves
(or creates) an empirical framework for analysis of the research
question that prompted the scenario analysis.]{.underline}

**Re-evaluate or begin to develop theory** \[Emphasis theirs\]

Finally, the point of most kinds of scenario analysis is, ultimately
cult social questions with better theories and data collection str stage
of the scenario process is to re-evaluate what is known about existing
theory given the generated scenarios. [Is the theory still logically
consistent? Is it able to explain the most important possible outcomes
in the social system or interest? Are there key drivers of particular
importance to the theory, seemed important appear to cause little
variation in the scenarios?]{.underline}

*Applying Counterfactual Best Practices to Scenarios*

Tetlock and Belkin offer six criteria for making counterfactuals more
rigerous. First, counterfactuals should have \"clarity,\" referring to
the specification of the hypothesized antecedent and consequent. Tetlock
and Belk manipulating one causal variable at a time, though they
recognize it is impossible to hold other factors equal while doing so
(Tetlock and Belklin 1996:19). Second, they should possess logical
consistency or \"cotenability," specifying cotenable principles that
link antecedents with consequents. Third, they should have historical
consistency (which they also call the rule\"), which suggests the chosen
antecedents should alter a few "well-established\" historical facts as
possible. In terms of future counterfactuals, this is most relevant to
the selection of contextual conditions, which should be as
uncontroversial to intended audiences as possible. An easy shorthand is
to treat contextual conditions as constants and to assign them values
that are well demonstrated in the present. Fourth, counterfactuals
should be theoretically consistent, meaning that the connecting
principles are consistent with theoretical generalizations that lead to
the links between antecedents and consequents. Fifth, they should
possess statistical consistency or articulating principles that are
consistent with \"well-established\" statistical generalizations. Last,
they should have projectability or the identification of implications of
connecting principles (hypotheses) that may be tested with new data
(Tetlock and Belkin 1996:18-31) (Table 2).

*Avoiding Potential Pitfalls*

The first potential pitfall of scenario analysis is the \"garbage in,
garbage out\" (GIGO) problem. Scenarios are likely to suffer from GIGO
problems under several circumstances. First, and most commonly,
scenarios are sometimes not used to extend and develop theory, but
rather to reinforce the existing views of the author. This may happen
should a researcher choose to ignore theoretically relevant values of
the independent variables based on a conclusion that such values are
\"implausible.\" Another way of conceiving of this problem is whether or
not the scenario process is a recapitulation of the \"official future,\"
as Schwartz has dubbed it (Schwartz 1996:237). The \"official future\"
is a scenario author\'s

**\[TABLE 2 OMMITTED\]**

operating mind-set regarding what they perceive as the most probable
future.5 Adherence to beliefs about an \"official future\" is similar to
an \"anchoring bias,\" whereby a subject has difficulty updating
original beliefs in the face of new information (discussed further in
the next section of this article) Second, the independent variables may
be chosen poorly to begin with; this is more of a consequence of not
taking the scenario process seriously rather than a cognitive bias
toward a particular outcome. Third, in scenarios that use data, the data
simply may be bad (for example, pollution projections based on faulty
assumptions or bad statistics, bias in a survey design, etc).

[The simplest way to correct for GIGO is to have other people involved
in the scenario-building process, particularly those from different
epistemological and cultural backgrounds]{.underline}. In other words,
one should implement a peer review process as part of scenario
development. **[The easiest corrective within reach of political
scientists is their students, who are in general less likely to be
wedded to particular theoretical/methodological
perspectives]{.underline}**. [Other options include colleagues in other
disciplines, who are likely to think about the question of interest in a
dramatically different way, thus generating different
drivers.]{.underline}

A second possible pitfall of the scenario method is poor replicability,
a topic of high importance to positivist approaches to social science.
Explaining one\'s coding and other such relevant aspects of research
design has now become standard practice, even for qualitative methods
that are difficult to replicate. Scenarios are almost surely less
replicable than case studies. While case studies at least have
footnotes, only the data/contextual aspect of scenarios is replicable.
The identification of key drivers and plotlines is a highly subjective
process. The best advice in this regard is that a large degree of
subjectivity is inherent in the scenario process, and clarity and
transparency are absolute necessities. A reader should be able to follow
along when reading the scenario and understand the relationship between
assumed contextual data, stipulated values on the independent variables,
the interaction of those variables, and the logic of how the interaction
effects a value on the dependent variable.

A third pitfall of scenarios is to try to engage with too many causal
processes at once. One of Peter Schwartz\'s important rules regarding
scenarios, which Steve Weber echoes, is to limit the complexity of a
scenario such that no more than three or four key drivers are subject to
change at once (Schwartz 1996:140; Weber 1996:283). While for some kinds
of research (particularly the articulation of world views) it is
important to look at these critical intersections of trend lines,
scenario methodologists persuasively argue that seeking to do too much
in one scenario quickly makes the effort futile. The reason for this is
simple and2 should be resonant to any scholar: the human mind has
difficulty handling a large number of causal processes at once. While it
is tempting stylized versions of the future in which many political
forces are moving together, a potential problem is to, in Tetlock and
Lebow\'s words "assign too much subjective probability to too many
scenarios\" (Tetlock and Lebow 2001).

The inability to simultaneously understand many causal processes is a
common problem of social science research. Consider, for instance, the
dizzying array of causal arguments made regarding the origins of World
War bright scholars have argued that the war was instigated by power
differentials, alliance systems, the personalities of political leaders
at the time, offense dominance, perceptions of offense dominance, rigid
military plans, tics in Germany, among others (Lebow 1981; Sagan 1986;
Snyder 1994; Evera 1999; Copeland 2000; Mansfield and Snyder 2007). Hist
credence to each of these arguments, and scholars must make individual
judgements regarding how to rank the causes. The *interaction* of these
various levels of explanation, unfortunately, has proven overly complex
for pol handle. Instead, the discipline offers contrasting perspectives
(for example, IR professors often focus on system-level explanations,
while historians tend to lean toward individual-level arguments) (Fearon
1991:189-193).6

Finally, in another form of analytic overreach, scenario authors often
excitedly focus on highly improbable, high-impact events. Richard Ned
Lebow has memorably referred to these as \"miracle counterfactuals\"
(Lebow 2000:565). Correcting for this problem is very difficult, as it
involves high degree when estimating the probabilities of many possible
outcomes. Another problem is that the very topics the scenario method
ought to assist with---those with no data---are often low-probability,
high-impact events (for example, nuclear warfare, plagues, large-scale
cyber attack \[sic\], etc.). Consider, for exam to include a highly
consequential new technology in a scenario. What makes one technological
success more plausible than another? The quickest decision rule is
simply to focus on technologies that have a basis in existing materials
and understandings of basic sciences and that are presently being
researched and developed. For example, a scenario in which humans are
able to transport anywhere around the globe would not meet a threshold
for plausibility, because there is presently no understanding of physics
that would allow for such a feat, and this kind of new understanding
would have to precede the development of a teleportation device.

**Advantages of Scenario Analysis for Political Scientists** \[Emphasis
theirs\]

As noted in our discussion of the counterfactuals literature, most
scholars about the method focus on history. [We argue that future
counterfactuals may assist scholars in the same ways as historical ones
and offer additional benefits. **Scenarios may be useful for theory
building and development, ident new hypotheses, analyzing data-poor
research topics, articulating \"world setting new research agendas,
avoiding cognitive biases, and teaching.**]{.underline}

*[Theory Building and Development]{.underline}*

[The structured analysis of future counterfactuals offers a **unique
approach for the study of causal effects in social
systems**]{.underline}. [The first category, and perhaps most
significant, is the ability of researchers to use scenarios to identify
variables of interest and consider ways to measure them.]{.underline}
This is an approach sometimes [recommended for qualitative
research]{.underline}; it consists of writing a notional depiction of
what a case study might look like. **[This exercise helps researchers to
think through what variables are of greatest interest, what values those
variables might take on, and how they interact to cause values of the
dependent variable]{.underline}**. [Scenario analysis is one way in
which researchers may conduct such a notional case study]{.underline}.
Rather than introduce a timeless or historical vignette regarding
fictional circumstances, the researcher may find it beneficial to place
their case in the future. [This helps orient the research project toward
current and anticipated political issues---**thus increasing the
relevance of the work**---even if the actual case studies are
historical.]{.underline} [Thinking through the causal process in this
way helps the researcher to identify a wider range of explanatory
variables, including that have not yet occurred or may be of very low
probability (but are still consistent with existing or proposed
theoretical arguments).]{.underline} Scenario analysis helps the
researcher to consider the range of values that the identified
independent variables may take on, as exploration of different
\"worlds\" pushes the boundaries of the researcher\'s predispositions
going into the research project. **[Robust scenario analysis thus helps
the researcher to identify the upper and lower bounds of their
theory.]{.underline}**

Second, a commonly cited advantage of [counterfactual reasoning that is
useful for this process of theory building is a researcher\'s attempt to
manipulate one variable in a causal process while holding others
constant]{.underline}, thus isolating the effects of different values of
the independent variable on the dependent variable. Manipulating one
variable at a time to do a better job of analyzing processes is often
very difficult to do, as, in the real world, interactions variables
often lead to unpredictable and nonlinear outcomes (Jervis 1997 60). For
instance, a scholar conducting an analysis of tax rates and other tic
legislation regarding oil may use a counterfactual of a different
average oil price in the 1970s. Such a counterfactual would have some
fairly obvious implications for the domestic political question, but a
world in which that one variable were manipulated would have a large
number of equally plausible second- and third-order consequences for
regional politics in the Middle East. Those consequences could
conceivably feed back into domestic US politics, thus affecting the
social system under analysis in a way the researcher may not have
controlled for in the original scenario.

Despite these acknowledged difficulties in using a \"manipulate one
variable" approach for the purpose of assaying real-world policy
options, it is a useful input to the processes of building theory and
research design. The best defense of such an approach is that all forms
of modeling involve abstractions from reality, and even highly
unrealistic models---such as James Fear condition in which war should
never occur---are useful for studying real events (Fearon 1995).
Furthermore, manipulating one variable at a time is more appropriate to
some kinds of counterfactual reasoning than others. Consider the three
main categories of scenario use: political narratives, game theory and
formal modeling, and experimentation. The \"manipulate one variable\"
approach seems at least useful to political narratives, which often try
to tackle such tough questions as \"What is the future of the
international system?\" Although advantages to developing and extending
theory in regard to these sorts of questions, particularly in assessing
key drivers and articulating world views (discussed in the next
subsections), a scientific approach of controlling for various social
factors is unlikely to succeed. In these projects, manipulating one
variable at a time serves only to develop one of many possible futures
in the interest of extending the range of the theory\'s explanatory
power.

On the other hand, the \"manipulate one variable\" approach of
advantages for formal modeling and experimentation. The reasoning for
each follows a comment made by Elinor Ostrom in her 1997 American
Political Science Association presidential address. [Ostrom suggested
that \"from...scenarios one can **proceed to formal models and empirical
testing in field settings**\"]{.underline} (Ostrom 1998). The
experimental method with human subjects benefits strongly from the use
of scenarios. In one study of how values factor into American's economic
decision making, a team of researchers sought to "attribute significant
differences in average responses between conditions to variables
manipulated in the hypothetical scenario; that is, to the factors
intuitive neorealists should weigh heavily and intuitive economists
should weigh lightly" (Herrmann, Tetlock, and Diascro 2001). That is to
say, one variable individuals\' world views could be manipulated at once
in the experiment, and the researcher may test for the significance of
variance between the test and control groups.

After using scenarios to better identify variables of interest and the
role of their specific values in a causal process, **[a third category
of applications of scenario analysis to theory building is to develop
new hypotheses and ways to test them]{.underline}**. [This follows from
using scenarios to identify new independent variables and how their
values may effect changes on the dependent variable; each new causal
argument may (and should) be expressed as a hypothesis to be tested in
the broader research project for which the scenario analysis was
developed.]{.underline} Additionally, [\"day after\" scenarios that seek
to walk back the causal processes that may have led to a consequential
event are particularly well suited to developing hypotheses]{.underline}
(Holmes and Yoshihara 2008). By definition, **[this type of scenario
analysis seeks to discover causal pathways.]{.underline}** For instance,
one might seek to chart various paths by which a particular type of
social revolution may occur in a country of interest. [Each narrative of
how such a revolution could come to pass would result in at least one
hypothesis regarding the links between the many variables of interest.
These hypotheses may then be tested against historical data or used to
develop new kinds of data collection methods]{.underline} (discussed
further in the next section).

Finally, scenario analysis [helps to explore completely new theoretical
projects in a deductive way, whereas a great deal of qualitative work in
political science tends to be inductive from the case study
method]{.underline}. The use of scenario analysis may help scholars to
pursue an \"abductive,\" or hybrid, method of theory building that draws
on both deductive reasoning and insights from cases (Mayer and Pirri
1995). [For example, **a data-poor research subject, such as how states
may respond to computer network attack, has few historical
precedents**]{.underline} (Mahnken 2011; Rid 2012). **[If a researcher
were interested in identifying the circumstances under which states are
more likely to resort to violence in response to cyber
attack]{.underline}** \[sic\], ~~he~~ **[\[they\] would be confounded by
the problem that never in history has a state responded with violence to
such an attack. Scenario analysis]{.underline}** beginning with the
value of violent counter-attack on the dependent variable (the DV being
a state strategy choice) **[would help the researcher to deduce likely
circumstances under which such an outcome may occur]{.underline}**.
[Historical analysis, such as regarding other kinds of information
threats, would be helpful for such a project, but the differences
between cyber and other kinds of information transmission would result
in an incomplete causal narrative based on inductive reasoning
alone.]{.underline}

*Data-Poor Research Topics*

[Scenarios are a useful method for theory building and research design
for topic that, despite being of high importance, lack an empirical
base. The **best example** of this type of research is scholarship on
nuclear warfare]{.underline}. [An enormous literature evolved during the
Cold War regarding how a nuclear war might be fought and how escalation
dynamics might occur]{.underline} (Kahn 1962; Brown and Mahnken 2011).
[This literature was based **almost exclusively on future
counterfactuals**]{.underline}, as there were no nuclear wars to study
and a very low \"n\"---consisting of the Cuba Missile Crisis and very
few other crises---for publicly acknowledged \"close calls" (Sagan
1995). Indeed, in our survey of the use of scenarios in the discipline
more than 25% were about nuclear warfare. [Other topics that are of high
importance but have a very low or zero \"n\" include great-power war,
global epidemic climate change, large-scale cyber attack, and weapon of
mass destruction terrorism.]{.underline}

The points made earlier regarding the identification of new variables
and hypotheses are relevant here. In addition to these advantages to new
research topics, [scenario analysis helps to identify new sources of
data]{.underline}. This is partially because scenarios help to identify
new independent variables, thus leading the researcher to think about
how to measure their values, but also by helping ~~him~~ \[them\] to
think of proxies for measurement when direct observation is not
possible. [For instance, a day-after analysis of a scenario of interest
would cause the researcher to ask what he \[they\] would have needed to
know to predict the occurrence of the future counterfactuals and in turn
help the researcher to think about ways in which the discipline could
identify that low-probability process if it begins to happen in the real
world.]{.underline}

*Articulation of "World Views"*

[In addition to the process of building theory, **scenarios are useful
in helping to link theories**]{.underline}. [This is known as the
articulation of a \"world view,\" which is a set of guiding logics for
how an international system operates, such as realism, constructivism,
and neoliberal institutionalism]{.underline} (Doyle 1997). For any world
view one may use scenario analysis to narrate what the theory logically
dictates ought to happen in the world. Similar to the benefit to theory
building, but on a greater scale, **[this approach offers an opportunity
for empirical validation of the world view over time.]{.underline}** For
instance, [a scenario at a high level of abstraction, such as the
structure of a political system, allows for the validation or
invalidation of multiple theories and interactions of theories. Should
behavior in the world fail to conform to the expectations of the world
view, this of course offers scholars an opportunity to reconsider the
guiding logics of their world view.]{.underline}

In the early 1990s, for example, a team of defense analysts had been
tasked with developing a set of scenarios for the post-Cold War security
environment (Project 2025 1994). They crafted a scenario of a future
world dominated by conflict between radical Islam and the West that
resembled in some key respects the current struggle against AI Qaeda and
its Associated Movements. The scenario should not be seen as a
prediction of current events, however. Rather, the scenario was
developed to test whether or not one could plausibly make the case for a
global ideological conflict at a time when IR scholars such as Francis
Fukuyama were arguing that ideological conflict had become a thing of
the past (Fukuyama 1992). Islam appeared to be the most plausible
universalist ideology that could trigger widespread conflict.

[Another example is that a realist scholar may benefit from a of the
likely futures of the European Union.]{.underline} [Such an analysis
would project different possible outcomes---ranging from dissolution
through more coherent foreign policy and security integration---from
basic premises consistent with the realist world view pitted against the
premises of competing world views.]{.underline} The final section of
this article offers an example of when John Mearsheimer conducted such
an analysis more than 20 years ago; he developed scenarios future of
Europe by comparing the expectations of offensive realism to other
theoretical approaches.

*[Setting Research Agendas]{.underline}*

The remainder of this section describes ways in which **[scenarios are
useful to political scientists in ways other than developing
theory.]{.underline}** [Scenarios are often used in the business and
national security policy communities to have "smarter conversations."
This use of the scenario method]{.underline} differs from positivist
social science and instead [seeks to improve knowledge through
participation in scenario exercises. Such exercises usually involve a
facilitated discussion. One way in which scenario conversations may make
researchers smarter is to **identify new research
questions**]{.underline}. [Thinking about critical drivers of the future
may help scholars to understand areas that presently have no useful
theories and avoid the tendency of the political science discipline to
consistently focus on a small number of questions]{.underline}. For
instance, [the New Era Foreign Policy Conference]{.underline}, initiated
by the University of California, Berkeley, and currently cosponsored by
the American University, University of California, Berkeley, and Duke
University [bring together graduate students of political science to
engage in scenario analysis and identify future research to research
topics.8]{.underline}

***[Avoiding Cognitive Biases]{.underline}***

In a methods book on scenarios, [James Ogilvy discussed the in**ability
of extremely bright people to see ahead due to cognitive biases**, that
is, what people found \"unthinkable,\" though those futures eventually
came into being.]{.underline} [In the context of discussing the future
of US and USSR nuclear arsenals during a 1980s scenario exercise, Ogilvy
wrote in hindsight that \"two decades later we now take for granted what
was then unthinkable to some very good thinkers"]{.underline} (Ogilvy
2002:191). This comment is very similar to an insight by Philip Tetlock
that **[pollical scientists tend to view surprises as overdetermined in
hindsight, but as inconceivable ahead of time]{.underline}** (Weber
1996:281).

[Scenarios]{.underline}, whether formally written or developed for
purposes [offer a powerful way for researchers to compensate for
cognitive biases endemic to any kind of human research.]{.underline}
[Scenarios do this by **forcing researchers to confront their most basic
assumptions** about how the world operates and by teasing out the
logical implications of extreme values on the independent variables of
interest.]{.underline} As Peter Schwart put it,

> [\"\[Scenario building is\] all part of a process of

> information\"]{.underline}** (Schwartz 1996:59)

[One of the most common forms of bias that scenarios help to compensate
for is an anchoring bias;]{.underline} [that is, the tendency to
interpret new information in ways that conform with our preexisting
beliefs]{.underline} (Jerris 1976:143-202). [One might also think about
this as a \"linear projection\" bias; scholars who have a view of how
the world is operating in the present (theoretically informed or not)
may well project this view into the future. In addition to forcing
scholars to explicitly confront these beliefs, the scenario process
**offers a way to think about sorting new information**. A completed
scenario project allows a researcher **to think about multiple futures**
(with differing plot lines for how the world arrived there) **at
once**]{.underline}. Thus, [new information is not automatically
compared against a single linear projection into the future, but rather
**weighted relative to alternative futures**]{.underline}. New
information might be consistent with all hypothesized futures, in which
case the new information may not lead to a new understanding. An example
is the current debate regarding whether China is rising or declining
relative to the United States. This literature, despite access to the
same data, offers remarkably different projections regarding the future
strength of each state and what this portends for the international
system (Pape 2005; Layne 2009; Beckley 2011/2012; Subramanian 2011). [In
many cases, however, new information is likely to favor one trend line
over another, thus changing how a researcher assigns probabilities to
various futures.]{.underline}

*[Pedagogy]{.underline}*

[Scenarios offer many of the same benefits as simulations]{.underline},
recently a hot topic in the pedogeological literature, to teaching in
political science (Newkirk and Hamilton 1979; Smith and Boyer 1996;
Newmann and Twigg 2000; Simpson and Kaussler 2009; Sasley 2010). Indeed,
scenarios are often a key part of simulation learning. For instance, [in
a decision-making simulation in which students are assigned the roles of
heads of state, the students are often offered a scenario vignette to
respond to with policy choices.]{.underline} The emphasis of scenarios
and simulations in pedagogy, however, is different. The literature on
simulations tends to focus on experiential learning, but recent
scholarship has cast some doubt on whether or not this kind of learning
improves students\' knowledge of core course concepts (Raymond 2010).

[Scenarios offer a way to make classroom exercises more explicitly
oriented toward the incorporation of theories]{.underline}. For
instance, rather than asking students to take on the roles of the
President, National Security Advisor, etc., [the students may be
presented with a vignette and asked to analyze the strategic
implications of the scenario for the United States]{.underline}. Both
coauthors of this article have used scenarios in classroom exercises.
Tom Mahnken has taught the use of scenarios for strategic planning at
the Naval War College. Tim Junio used scenario exercises at the
University of Pennsylvania. Students [in the class \"International
Security,\" having been assigned Thomas Schilling\'s Arms and Influence
and other core readings on strategy, were asked to evaluate a scenario
in which the United States had committed itself to military action, but
was subsequently held hostage by a foreign power.]{.underline}

In Junio\'s scenario, [a future US President was led to believe that due
to an intelligence breakthrough, North Korean nuclear weapon targets
were rendered vulnerable to a US first strike with conventional
weapons]{.underline}. The United States and close allies saw this as an
opportunity for regime change and pre-positioned US forces in the
region. The US President then issued an ultimatum Korean regime to
vacate the country within 48 hours, akin to the Saddam Hussein in 2003,
or face a forceful regime change at the hands of the US-led coalition.
To the surprise of US leaders, North Korea\'s Supreme Leader went on
television to announce that an unspecified number of nuclear warheads
had been smuggled into the United States as a contingency against such a
Supreme Leader then declared that any act of aggression against the
North Korean people would be met with retaliation against the US
homeland. **[Students in the class were asked to first discuss the
strategic situation for the United States.]{.underline}** [What mistakes
had been made to get the United States into that scenario? What issues
were at stake? Then, the students were asked to apply strategic concepts
to discuss how the United States might seek to extricate itself from the
situation.]{.underline}

[The North Korea\'s blackmail scenario]{.underline} is an example of an
extremely low-probability event that almost certainly would not justify
much further intelligence and defense policy communities, **[but is
extremely useful for pedagogy.]{.underline}** [This kind of scenario
**increases student interest in the material** and forces them to engage
with the theories and concepts of the course.]{.underline} Rather than
focus on policy decisions alone, as simulations are likely to do,
[student bring deductive logic to bear to assess the boundaries of the
scenario.]{.underline}

**Demonstrations of Robust Scenario Analysis** \[Emphasis theirs\]

*Mearsheimer 1990a,b*

A widely read example of scenario analysis, though one not often
considered methodologically interesting, is John Mearsheimer\'s \"Back
to the Future: Instability in Europe After the Cold War\" (published
more accessibly as \"Why We Will Soon Miss the Cold War\") (Mearsheimer
1990a,b). Mearsheimer offered several scenarios of what post-Cold War
Europe might look like; one he deemed most probable suggested that
Germany (and possibly others) would develop nuclear weapons and that
European states would resume competition. Mearsheimer contrasted this
scenario, driven by expectations of offensive realism, with outcomes
predicted by the democratic peace and economic interdependence
perspectives.

The dependent variable of interest in Mearsheimer\'s scenario analysis
risk of war in Europe following the end of the Cold War. His primary
research question was, \"Would the end of the bipolar power structure
res or lower risk of war?\" He considered several independent variables,
including the distribution of military power (possible values: a range
along a spectrum from bipolar to multipolar \[unipolar perhaps being
logically possible, but he does not explicitly include it as a
possibility\]); the character of military power, defined in terms of the
distribution of nuclear weapons (possible values: abolition, sustenance
of existing levels, unmitigated proliferation, or mitigated
proliferation \[current nuclear powers manage their spread\]); and
domestic politics (possible values: degree of nationalism, ranging from
high to low was explicit regarding how he believed these independent
variables should effect values on his dependent variable of war
proneness. Bipolar power distributions were believed to be more stable
than multipolar. Nuclear weapons were expected to increase the
probability of war in the first three of his four categorical values.
High values of nationalism were expected to increase the risk of war,
while low values of nationalism would reduce or keep even the risk of
war.

The shortest formulation of Mearsheimer\'s theory of offensive states
seek to maximize their relative power. A relevant aspect of the theory
that Mearsheimer articulated is states\' perceptions of the costs and
risks of going to war; he believed a competitive world under offensive
realism still be peaceful if the costs and risks of going to war were
perceive high and the benefits of going to war low (Mearsheimer
1990a:12). Mearsheimer also noted competing theoretical approaches
regarding how European states were likely to behave during his analyzed
time period: an international institutions perspective (IV: the strength
of international institutions, ordinal), which Mearsheimer deemed
irrelevant as power-seeking behavior should trump institutional
concerns; democratic peace theory (IV: joint democracy, binary), which
he found unpersuasive for a few reasons, including nationalism,
defection, and uneven spread of democracy among post-Soviet states; and
pacifism (IV: binary, learned war is bad or did not), which Mearsheimer
believed lacks an empirical basis.

Although Mearsheimer discussed these other theoretical perspectives
superficially, he developed a detailed account based on how he believed
offensive realism would effect \[sic\] values on his three main
independent variables of interest. He believed \"it is certain that
bipolarity will disappear, and multipolarity will emerge in the new
European order\" (Mearsheimer 1990a:31). He believed this with the end
of the US and Soviet spheres of influence, European states be strongly
incentivized by the anarchic character of the international system to
provide for their own security. Thus, no two states were likely to
emerge as clear poles in the European state system; rather, power would
be diffused as many states competed with one other. Mearsheimer was
highly confident in this outcome and treated it as more of a background
condition than an important determinant of outcomes on his dependent
variable.

The second two independent variables were nuclear proliferation and
nationalism. Mearsheimer viewed the most critical uncertainty regarding
the future of security in Europe as the distribution and deployment
patterns of nuclear weapons. He wrote that \"the best new order would
incorporate the limited, managed proliferation of nuclear weapons. This
would be more dangerous than rent order, but considerably safer than
1900-1945. The worst order would be a non-nuclear Europe in which power
inequalities emerge between the principal poles of power\" (Mearsheimer
1990a:31). Mearsheimer offered scenarios of what it would look like if
each of these outcomes resulted. Finally, Mearsheimer considered the
future that actually resulted, or the continuation of existing weapon
ownership patterns. He argued that his theory predicted this would not
come to be, as Germany was expected to desire nuclear weapons so that
they would not have to rely on Poland and Czechoslovakia to provide a
barrier against a Soviet invasion, and because small East European
states would similarly perceive nuclear weapons to be of the highest
security interest. Nationalism was less important and factored into
Mearsheimer\'s analysis as an interaction effect between nuclear
proliferation and nationalism that may make war likely under some
conditions.

In summary, [Mearsheimer\'s article provides an excellent example of
scenario analysis being used to extend an existing theory and develop
testable hypotheses that were subsequently falsified.]{.underline} His
futures also constitute \"plot lines\" formed by the interaction of
multiple variables of interest. Mearsheimer explained why he expected a
particular outcome in Western Europe in the 1990s and did not expect
other outcomes. The historical record clearly falsifies the hypotheses
derived from his theory of offensive realism. Various reasons may
explain why his theory was incorrect---such as normative claims,
continued reliance on US security guarantees, and so on---but [it is at
least clear that his scenario approach framed a debate in a rigorous and
clearly articulated way and has led to new areas of exploration for the
discipline.]{.underline}

*Payne 2001*

A second example of robust scenario analysis is a chapter from Keith
Payne\'s book *The Fallacies of Cold War Deterrence and a New Direction*
(Payne 2001). In this chapter, Payne used a scenario to demonstrate how
the assumptions underlying traditional deterrence analysis, which were
developed during the Cold War, may not apply to a conflict between the
United States and China. Payne also used this scenario to demonstrate
why in the theoretical sections of his book he emphasized some variables
that traditional deterrence theorists downplay. His self-proclaimed
purpose was to use a scenario analysis to test whether a more empirical
approach, drawing on cultural and domestic political contexts, is more
applicable to future conflicts than the deductive reasoning applied to
the Cold War.

The dependent variable in Payne\'s analysis was whether or not an
adversary is deterred. He then took traditional independent variables
from the existing deterrence literature and drew on extensive secondary
sources to question what relaxing assumptions about the values of those
variables would do to the dependent variable. For instance, in deductive
reasoning, such factors as a state\'s cultures (organizational and in
the usual sense of tradition) are assumed to be either constant on both
sides or irrelevant because other variables matter more. Payne suggested
that in a particular context, these variables are not only important,
but also may dominate outcomes.

To explain how variation in these independent variables may yield an
undeterred adversary, Payne developed an excellent \"full\" qualitative
scenario. His primary interest was Chinese decision making. The context
is whether or not the United States could deter China from escalating to
violent conflict during a crisis over the status of Taiwan. Rather than
assume constant values for China on the independent variables, Payne
manipulated these variables (several at once, not a \"one variable at a
time\" approach) to show how China: is more risk tolerant than notional
adversaries in the traditional deterrence literature; considers many
political issues of lower importance than the status of Taiwan;
perceives it has little freedom to back down; and has difficulty
understanding US demands and viewing them as credible. Factors that
cause them to have these different values are related to the Chinese
regime\'s culture and incentive structures. For instance, Payne focused
on how the erosion of communist ideology has led the regime to emphasize
national unity and stability as justifications for its continued hold on
power, thus making the Taiwan issue of high importance. His points
regarding risk tolerance come from Chinese strategic culture; Payne
follows analysts who place great meaning in the fact that the Chinese
word for \"crisis\" has connotations of both danger and opportunity.
Variation on all of these indepedent variables may, Payne argued, lead
to an undeterred China, although traditional deterrence theory would
yield a deterred China.

**Conclusion** \[Emphasis theirs\]

[The role of academics in policymaking is a cyclical debate in the IR
subfield]{.underline}. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and
subsequent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, [a vocal group has once again
elevated the perspective that **political science professors should be
contributing to these pressing national security problems**]{.underline}
(Andres and Beecher 1989; George 1993; Putnam 2003; Monroe 2005; Nye
2009; Mead 2010). [Nearly all of the discourse on \"bridging the gap\"
between academia and the policy world emphasizes how **academics may
help policymakers**, particularly with rigorous methods for testing
social science hypotheses. The **scenario method is one way** in which
political scientists may improve the policy relevance of their work. It
also shows that ideas flowing in the other direction are promising: the
policy community and other disciplines have **potential to improve the
quality of political science research**]{.underline}. The future counter
approach has been used by policymakers and wealth creators to
impressions for decades, while our discipline has consistently relied to
a great degree on the past. [Thinking and writing about the future in a
robust way offers political scientists an exciting opportunity to push
the boundaries of current and to generate new ones, while also improving
the processes of teach theory building.]{.underline}

### Simulation Good---NATO

#### Competitive role playing in the context of NATO is good. It produces an in-depth knowledge of foreign policy, cultural and historical complexity, and international relations.

Howard. "Learning to Learn; Learning to Win: How to Succeed in the
Simulated World of Model NATO." Cambridge University Press: Political
Science and Politics. Oct 1, 2008.\]

[Academic Merits of Model NATO]{.underline}

[What scholastic benefits accrue from the Model NATO simulation?
**Student role playing in a competitive context encourages participants
to make connections and develop a depth of understanding that are not
usually the focus of standard class lectures**]{.underline} (Hertel and
Millis Reference Hertel and Millis2002).

Over the past five years, Model NATO agenda items have reflected five
broad themes: (1) new adjustment challenges and commitments facing NATO
in the post-Cold War era\'s shifting nature of the alliance; (2) NATO
enlargement and its geopolitical consequences; (3) the proper role of
the U.S. within NATO (sometimes referred to as the
"Atlanticist-Continentalist" debate); (4) NATO/European Union relations;
and (5) international crisis management and peace-support operations.

As suggested by this thematic list, [Model NATO is not a narrow military
competition. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO\'s agenda has broadened
significantly]{.underline}, so that a surprisingly increasing number of
NATO programs are largely nonmilitary in character (e.g., the Istanbul
Initiative, Mediterranean Dialogue, and Euro-Atlantic Partnership
Council). This means **[students must study and be well versed in a wide
array of political, diplomatic, and economic issues that extend beyond
traditional military alliance concerns.]{.underline}** For example, the
2005 Model NATO agenda included such topics as European Union-NATO
relations, NATO-Russia relations, and NATO-Ukraine cooperation, as well
as more traditional military subjects like WMD nonproliferation programs
and global terrorism. [If students fail to develop this breadth of
knowledge, they risk being dominated or marginalized in the Model NATO
competition.]{.underline}

Further, [many NATO agenda items are connected to specific
programs]{.underline}. For example, European-NATO relations are
increasingly influenced by the European Union\'s European Security and
Defense Program (ESDP) and NATO\'s Defense Capabilities Initiative
(DCI). **[In order to compete successfully, students need both broad
issue area understanding and specific programmatic knowledge in order to
negotiate agreements consistent with the interests of other NATO
members]{.underline}**. Allegheny [students have won the Model NATO
competition by integrating their expertise across different issues to
elaborate broad team strategies and objectives that are realized through
the creating and negotiating of concrete policy proposals]{.underline}.
These proposals emerge in the form of communiqués, drafted by the
students. **[Pedagogically, the breadth and depth of knowledge promoted
by Model NATO make it an excellent vehicle for studying European
security, broadly defined.]{.underline}**

[Besides mastering NATO-related issues and programs, students must know
the country they represent and learn its policy-relevant
characteristics]{.underline}. Examples may include the following:

•[How internal political issues influence foreign policy]{.underline} in
one\'s assigned country. For instance, when representing France in the
Model NATO competition, students learned the policy implications of
presidential-prime minister splits during the cohabitation period from
1997--2002.

•[How foreign policy country profiles influence national perceptions and
behavior]{.underline}. For example, Greece has a reputation as a spoiler
country in NATO because it frequently uses its veto power for bargaining
purposes. Or Canada\'s peacekeeping reputation, which, over time, has
seriously degraded Canadian combat capabilities.

•[How certain issues and geographic proximity produce alliance
patterns]{.underline} (e.g., the Spain-France-Italy axis on
Mediterranean issues; Visegrad countries in Eastern Europe). In Model
NATO, sometimes even committee seating arrangements can influence
cooperation patterns among student delegations---students sitting
together may be more likely to cooperate than when they are seated
apart.

[•How power differentials might be exploited in NATO
politics.]{.underline} For instance, on certain issues, small countries
might be mobilized against large ones.

[In the competitive, role-playing context of Model NATO, students learn
quickly that pursuing narrow, personal agendas almost always fail**.
Seeing international problems from multiple viewpoints and fashioning
consensus agreements are the keys to success. Knowledge of issues,
programs, and country characteristics make the negotiating of common
group agendas and agreements possible.**]{.underline}

[Shifting our focus from the inner workings of Model NATO to broader
scholastic issues, we note that the **simulation can satisfy a
curriculum-enhancing function** in at least three important
ways.]{.underline} [First, because of Model NATO\'s issue-area breadth,
it can serve as a capstone experience for the international relations
and comparative politics subfields in most political science
curricula]{.underline}. For example, Model NATO is a natural arena for
students seeking to apply their knowledge of national security and
foreign policy courses on one hand, or European and post-Soviet courses
on the other. Second[, because of Model NATO\'s emphasis on writing,
negotiating, and debating, it can serve as a culminating experience in
an applied communications program]{.underline}. Finally, Model NATO\'s
academic rigor makes it suitable to be the centerpiece of an honors
seminar for advanced political science or international studies
students.

#### Simulation model-based learning in the context of NATO produces active student learning. That forces in depth research and broad educational improvements.

Abstract

This article **[discusses international simulation "models" as vehicles
for active student learning and leadership development]{.underline}**.
Drawing on his role as the faculty sponsor of his school's delegation
and managing director of the overall conference, the author details the
structure, workings, and benefits of International Model NATO as well as
"best practices" for success. With some personal testimonies, he
concludes that the results demonstrate that this is "what a teaching
career is all about."

As the Farmer's Insurance television commercial proclaims: "We know a
thing or two because we have seen a thing or two." In 48 years as a
college professor, I have seen a thing or two, and I believe that I may
know a thing or two about teaching. A wall full of teaching awards and
citations, including one of the highest national teaching awards in the
country, might attest to the proposition, but what I know for certain is
that **[the best learning experiences have been "active learning"
simulations beyond the regular classroom. The "thing or two" that I will
highlight here are simulated Model activities.]{.underline}**

Most people know Model United Nations (see Hazen 2018), but fewer have
experienced the other "models." Howard University's Dr. Michael Nwanze
created several international model simulations that include Arab
League, NATO, African Union, and Organization of American States. Some
operate today under different sponsors, but he continues to administer
Model NATO and Model African Union. These programs are his life's
passion, a labor of love. I have done Model UN and can attest to its
value, but my 32 years in Model Arab League (MAL) and 15 years in
International Model NATO provide, in my opinion, far superior student
learning experiences. I have written about MAL in the past (Dunn 1990;
1994; 2002); here I address International Model NATO.

In the large Model UNs, it is possible for a student to be passive or
minimally engaged. [That is not an option in the constant debate and
negotiating in International Model NATO.]{.underline} The delegate is
that country's sole voice in a particular committee and all decisions
demand unanimity. One must perform one's duty every minute. [Also, the
more focused agenda topics allow for and demand greater expertise by
each delegate.]{.underline}

M[odel NATO imitates the 29-nation collective security alliance,
headquartered in Brussels.]{.underline} The Model convenes for 4 days
annually in February at a downtown Washington, DC hotel. Participating
universities come from across the United States, Canada, and Europe (in
recent years from Britain, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, and Sweden).
Each institution represents a member country in the several committees
that the Model simulates.

[The directors' strive to maintain a proper balance between reflecting
the actual functioning of the NATO alliance and the adjustments
necessary to maximize the participatory learning experience for all
students]{.underline}. The North Atlantic Council (NAC), the policy
center of NATO, is the heart of International Model NATO, and the
conference replicates five other committees. [Despite an organized
agenda for debate prepared months in advance, world crises erupt in the
real world and also at the Model]{.underline}. Intensity peaks when the
directors at various points interject a crisis or multiple ones which
require the delegates to respond. Often these incidents come out of the
daily newspaper.

A skilled Secretariat, which includes the Security-General and the
committee chairs, conduct the student-led activity. Preparation to
fulfill these leadership roles begins a year in advance. The simulation
operates formally within the committees during the designated hours and
informally after the days' sessions end. Committees often go to lunch
and dinner together. After the conclusion of the formal committee
sessions on Saturday afternoon, the Secretariat spends hours compiling
from the several committee resolutions the final communique, which must
be adopted unanimously at the NAC Summit on Sunday morning.

Students on the North Atlantic Council meet informally Saturday evening,
often well into the morning hours, to negotiate consensus on issues
still in dispute. This practice started years ago when some of the most
committed students at the Model picked up the draft copy of the
communique as soon as it was released and met for dinner to discuss it.
Over time, more and more individuals joined the group. What began
casually is now routine practice. Today most NAC members voluntarily
assemble in a large hallway, sitting on the floor dressed in jeans and
sweats. The activity occurs outside the structures and committee rooms
without members of the Secretariat in attendance. A different kind of
grassroots leadership emerges in this casual setting without formal
procedures and posturing for recognition in the committee rooms.
Consensus is the goal.

[This level of student engagement, which developed spontaneously,
represents one of the most impressive expansions of the
Model]{.underline}. The voting for awards by judges and peers is over at
this point. Most faculty members are out to dinner and off to bed while
these sessions continue well into the night. While their friends and
peers may be socializing or sleeping, the NAC members, who tend to be
among the most dedicated and talented individuals on each school's
delegation, are hard at work. [Students participate because they
care]{.underline}. Several confess that this is their favorite activity
of the entire Model. [The level of talent, commitment, leadership that I
have witnessed in these sessions encourages me about future national and
world leaders, and indeed many past participants are well on their way
to significant careers.]{.underline}

The NAC Summit is the culminating event with the delegates
enthusiastically representing their adopted country's interests while
engaging in compromise and seeking consensus. The Secretary General who
oversees this hard-fought process must be a leader of considerable
talent. I am impressed by how a young student can conduct 3 or 4 hours
of fast-paced activity that includes managing hundreds of amendments,
negotiating compromise, and maintaining proper protocol at every point.
Every year I witness leaders who make constant split-second
organizational decisions and adroitly manage a room of Type A and
challenging personalities.

[Model NATO fosters learning about the culture, policies, security
interests, and diplomacy of nations that many students know little
about.]{.underline} Embassy visits and briefings by top diplomats are
popular opportunities. The last 2 years, my students represented
Slovenia and Lithuania, and in 2019 will represent Montenegro. I doubt
that many of them knew much about these countries prior to the
assignment**[. But intense research,]{.underline}** meeting the
ambassadors themselves at the respective embassies, **[and a serious
effort to act as the country's voice is the objective.]{.underline}**
Delegates must represent the country's view, not an American
interpretation of what the nation's policy should be.

**[Learning the ways and means of diplomacy and practicing the arts of
negotiation and persuasion are valuable skills]{.underline}**. Meeting
individuals from across the country and globe, several of whom will be
world movers in future years, cannot help but enhance a student's
development. Our two Model involvements have been the beginning of
careers in diplomacy and international security for a number of my
students, including several foreign service officers, and some have
already risen to important ranks. I will cite only three examples whose
careers were directly grounded in their Model experiences. One came to
college to be a high school music teacher but instead became a U.S. Air
Force officer who served three tours in Iraq, including working with the
development of the Kurdistan Regional Government. Another intended to be
a junior high school band director, but through Model involvement came
to teach in Morocco and then joined the Air Force to become an
intelligence officer. Another is a State Department officer who was in
Libya at the time of the Benghazi crisis and presently serves in a
national security role in Turkey. I have hopes for her to become my
first U.S. ambassador. All three were from tiny South Carolina towns and
had virtually no experience with the larger world until they joined the
Model Programs delegations in their respective freshmen years. I could
cite dozens more as well, and each school has its anecdotal stories.
College should be transformative. For these young women, clearly it was.

Delegations arrive at Model NATO with various levels of expertise, but
most are well prepared. Within my delegation, senior peer leaders
prepare more junior students for participation[. Our delegation leaders
train the neophytes in research skills, policy papers, parliamentary
procedure, debate and diplomatic techniques, and proper
protocol]{.underline}. Considerable thought goes into the matchups of
peer mentors for each individual 1st-year delegate. The single most
rewarding experience for me is watching the growth of mentors who take
very seriously their responsibility for the care of younger members in
their charge. Our delegation practices diligently for the event. The
team is extracurricular and entirely student-led by aspirant leaders who
exercise a level of commitment that one can see why they will be
successful in life. To employ a sports metaphor, our goal is not to have
a good team in a given year because we have particularly able talent
that year but to ensure that with protocols of expectations, practices,
and infrastructure, we will perform at the highest level every year. We
enjoy the luxury that are delegates participate for multiple years so we
can witness a continuing process of development. Maximizing student
development makes this, as I have said, the best learning laboratory
that I am able to provide my students.

Assessment is integral to all activities today. We have several
practices to enhance the experience for future years. The Office of
Public Diplomacy, at NATO Headquarters in Brussels, which provides some
financial support for the Model, has required procedures, including a
survey monkey for all participants. The Model directors also convene
student focus groups at the close of proceedings to provide feedback and
to compile suggestions. The directors discuss the findings at a later
date through emails and meetings. The Secretariat conducts its own
internal assessment about the management of the event. These assessment
activities will result in some substantiate changes in the 2019 Model.

In the important realm of student learning outcomes, different
participating schools have their own procedures. I can and will speak
only to our school's practices. Each student receives continuous
feedback about performance, by me as the sponsor and by our delegation
leadership team. First-year delegates meet weekly with their peer mentor
for advice and assistance. The prime learning objective is to develop
confidence in speaking and negotiation. These skills are grounded in a
knowledge base acquired from research. Whatever rubrics or tools one
could develop pale in comparison to the simple observation of the
enhancement of confidence and skills through practice and participation.
To invoke another sports metaphor, "how one practices determines how one
performs." Possibly the best indication that participation makes a
difference is that my faculty colleagues remark that they can recognize
"Model people" instantly in their classes no matter what the discipline.
The authority, leadership, and polish show. These students demonstrate a
passion to present, whether a chemistry project, business proposal, or
book analysis. Obviously, this is not the only way to achieve these
skills, but in my experience it is a proven one.

The majority of our delegation members are not political science or
history majors, although we win some "converts" through their
participation. We draw from every major on campus from the sciences to
business to the arts, with a large number of our delegation from the
School of Music, one of our institution's highest profile programs. I am
often asked what kind of background I prefer for Model participants. I
remark that I like athletes and music and theater people. They
understand the need for practice and at the proper time one must step up
and perform. No excuses just perform whatever the circumstances. At
heart this activity provides domestic and global citizen training. While
I am proud that we can boast music, art, biology, and accounting majors
(among others) who are now foreign service officers, I am equally
gratified that students whose careers are far removed from the political
realm are better informed citizens through their experience in our
program. I will add at this late point that we are a women's college and
I have devoted over 40 years intensely to developing women leaders. The
Models have done that.

A brief word about expense. This activity is not cost free. For
International Model NATO, travel and hotel costs are not inexpensive.
Delegation fees, however, are considerably less than Model UN delegate
fees. The travel and hotel costs for most regional models are much less
expensive than in Washington, DC. Each participating school has
differing funding means. Bringing home awards and resultant publicity
does tend to appeal to deans. The issue of academic credit is another
matter. It varies by institution from academic courses, extracurricular
credit, club activity without credit, etc.; and funding sources are
often determined by the nature of where the delegation resides at any
given institution. I will add only this personal remark, which some may
consider heretical, that I closed down our Model UN to devote the money
to Model Arab League and International Model NATO, because I discerned
far more value for the expenditure. Finally, for those contemplating
venturing into this kind of teaching exercise, it is possible to enact
many of the practices of Model active learning within a classroom or on
one's home campus.

**[If you believe in active learning, in students asserting control of
their own education, and in maximum development of skills that translate
into career success, you should give serious attention to the power of
Models as a learning venue]{.underline}**. As I observe my own students
in action, I often remember when the individual first joined the
program, and as I reflect on what she has become and will be, I cannot
help but say to myself, "This is what a teaching career is all about."

### Simulation Good---Policy

#### Simulations of political decision making increase contextual education, increase analytical skills, and boost self-efficacy \-- that's key to long term skills and political engagement.

1\. Introduction

[Simulation-based learning environments mirror real-world
complexity]{.underline} and limitations by including realistic
conditions such as environmental distractions, stress and time pressure
(Aldrich, 2006; Beaubien & Baker, 2004; Herrington & Oliver, 2000).
**[Such learning environments are appreciated for their richness and
authenticity]{.underline}** (Breckwoldt, Gruber, & Wittman, 2014;
Chernikova et al., 2020; Duchatelet, Gijbels, Bursens, Donche, &
Spooren, 2019[). Role-play simulations are a specific type of simulation
in which participants represent a specific actor in a predefined
situation, while following a set of rules and interacting with other
participants]{.underline} (Lean, Moizer, Towler, & Abbey, 2006). **[Such
simulations are the most commonly used active learning method to teach
about complex, dynamic political processes in several higher education
programmes, such as law or political science education]{.underline}**
(Ishiyama, 2013; Smith & Boyer, 1996). [Students learn about political
decision-making by acting out the role of a real political actor within
socio-political processes]{.underline} on the regional (e.g. city
council), national (e.g. national parliament) or international level
(e.g. European Parliament) (Boyer & Smith, 2015; Duchatelet et al.,
2019**[). Such role-play simulations of political decision-making are
highly valued by students and lecturers because they seem to foster
student learning]{.underline}** (Baranowski & Weir, 2015; Bruce, 1988;
Giovanello, Kirk, & Kromer, 2013; Schech, Kelton, Carati, & Kingsmill,
2017; Smith & Boyer, 1996; Van Dyke, DeClair, & Loedel, 2000). For
example, research in the context of Model United Nations (MUN)
simulations -- which simulate existing UN bodies such as the Security
Council -- has shown that they enhance student knowledge and improve
specific skills (Crossley-Frolick, 2010; Obendorf & Randerson, 2013).

However, recent reviews about student learning in role-play simulations
of political decision-making point to the complexity of these learning
environments and the related difficulty faced by the field to capture
the simulation's contribution to student learning (Baranowski & Weir,
2015; Duchatelet et al., 2019). In addition to a certain real-world
dimension, simulations are characterized by human agency and dynamism
(Duchatelet et al., 2019; Wright-Maley, 2015). As such, teachers who
have been using simulations for some time have experienced students
initiating different interactions and behaviour each time they engage in
the same kind of simulation, which usually generates different processes
and simulation outcomes (Usherwood, 2015). To date, our understanding of
why there is student variation in learning outcomes during the
simulation process is limited (Duchatelet et al., 2019).

Focusing on the simulation process, this study focuses on the learning
outcome of self-efficacy in negotiating. **[Self-efficacy is known to be
a dynamic motivational construct that is susceptible to change and that
fluctuates over time]{.underline}** (Cassidy & Eachus, 2002; Schunk &
DiBenedetto, 2016; Tang, Addison, LaSure-Bryant, & Norman, 2004). [This
makes it a suitable learning outcome for exploring the simulation
process]{.underline}. **[Within role-play simulations of political
decision-making, negotiating skills are often seen as the key skills
required by participants to be able to engage in the
simulation]{.underline}** (McIntosh, 2001; Obendorf & Randerson, 2013).
Negotiating processes can lead to positive sum outcomes but also to
deadlocks. [When strategies have been attempted and rejected,
negotiators might experience difficulties, and negotiations might lead
to no outcome at all]{.underline}. **[In such cases, resilience and the
ability to bounce back from impasses become crucial]{.underline}**
(Spector, 2006).

Previous research has shown that [self-efficacy contributes to
persistence, resilience and the overcoming of difficulties]{.underline}
(Bandura, 1997; Cassidy, 2015; Pajares, 1996), which are needed during
negotiations (Spector, 2006). This makes self-efficacy in negotiating a
relevant outcome on which to focus. Inherently, **[student agency shapes
the simulation dynamics, in which social processes emerge that compel
students to choose actions,]{.underline}** such as to strive for a
coalition or minority block (Duchatelet et al., 2019). The simulation
process is thus heavily shaped by social features, which have also been
known to influence self-efficacy development (Bandura, 1997). Therefore,
this study includes perceived student cohesiveness -- the extent to
which students know, help and support one another (Fraser, 1998) -- as a
potentially important explanatory factor.

In summary, this study contributes to the literature in several ways.
Firstly, [it enhances our understanding of the simulation process by
studying how self-efficacy in negotiating develops over the period of a
four-day MUN simulation]{.underline}. Secondly, it focuses on explaining
student variation in self-efficacy development, with this study
including perceived student cohesiveness as a social characteristic,
alongside individual characteristics. The next section introduces the
outcome of self-efficacy in greater detail, and presents the potential
factors contributing to variation in the development of self-efficacy in
negotiating.

2\. Theoretical framework

2.1. Self-efficacy in higher education

Over the past three decades, educational research on self-efficacy has
substantially increased. Research interests have been driven by findings
that consistently point to the importance of self-efficacy, which is
considered a significant affective learning outcome (Pintrich, 1994;
Vermunt & Donche, 2017). **[The concept of self-efficacy can be defined
as an individual's belief that they are capable of learning and
performing actions at designated levels (]{.underline}**Bandura, 1997).
In an educational context[, research generally focuses on academic
self-efficacy, which refers to student beliefs in their academic
capabilities]{.underline} (Metcalf & Wiener, 2018; Zimmerman, 2000). In
addition, [self-efficacy can apply to specific skills]{.underline}, such
as writing skills (e.g. Pajares, 2003), or subjects such as the natural
sciences or mathematics (e.g. Chen & Usher, 2013; Usher & Pajares,
2009). As self-efficacy refers to self-evaluating one's own abilities,
[it plays a key role in motivating students to improve their competences
and future actions]{.underline}. **[It is also associated with student
success, positively influencing academic achievement, student motivation
and regulative learning outcomes]{.underline}** (Bandura, 1997; Pajares,
1996; Richardson, Abraham, & Bond, 2012; Robbins et al., 2004; Schunk &
Pajares, 2005; van Dinther, Dochy, & Segers, 2011; Vermunt & Donche,
2017; Zimmerman, 2000).

In general, **[high levels of self-efficacy promote future skill
development, as it helps students to engage in tasks, to work harder and
to persist longer, especially when encountering
difficulties]{.underline}** (Bandura, 1997; Bouffard-Bouchard, Parent, &
Larivée, 1991; Zepke, Leach, & Butler, 2010). Less self-efficacious
students, on the contrary, may procrastinate and not initiate the effort
required to achieve certain goals (Honicke & Broadbent, 2016; Komarraju
& Nadler, 2013; Vogel & Human-Vogel, 2016; Wäschle, Allgaier, Lachner,
Fink, & Nückles, 2014). Resilience has also been related to a higher
degree of self-efficacy (Cassidy, 2015; Lee et al., 2013). [Behaviours
such as engagement and persistence, both related to self-efficacy, also
contribute to student negotiating behaviour. They are manifest in
resilience in pursuing outcomes and perseverance despite the impasses
which may arise during negotiations, both of which are
important]{.underline} (Spector, 2006).

**[In the political decision-making literature, the following skills are
implicitly connected to negotiating: oral communication skills and
public speaking, as well as more complex negotiation skills such as
arguing and debating issues,]{.underline}** coalition formation and the
art of diplomacy (Crossley-Frolick, 2010; Elias, 2014; Obendorf &
Randerson, 2013). [Considering the importance of self-efficacy and the
need to use negotiation skills when engaging in a
simulation]{.underline} (Honicke & Broadbent, 2016; McIntosh, 2001;
Obendorf & Randerson, 2013), **[self-efficacy in negotiating can be seen
as an important learning outcome in negotiation-based simulations such
as role-play simulations of political decision-making.]{.underline}**

2.2. Explaining the development of self-efficacy in negotiating

According to the present knowledge base[, students develop self-efficacy
by interpreting information from four primary sources]{.underline}: [by
evaluating previous experiences]{.underline} (mastery experience); [by
observing, evaluating and comparing other students' performances to
their own]{.underline} (vicarious experience); [by appraising verbal
judgements given by others, such as feedback]{.underline} (social
persuasion); [and by interpreting their own emotional
responses]{.underline} and physical arousal as a confidence signal when
contemplating action (physical/emotional state) (Bandura, 1997).
Overall, the research on teaching political decision-making has paid
limited attention to self-efficacy as an important learning outcome[.
Self-efficacy research is elaborated more in the field of role-play
simulations used in medical and nursing education, the findings of which
point to the presence of several sources of self-efficacy that
contribute to its development]{.underline} (Egenberg, Øian, Eggebø,
Arsenovic, & Bru, 2016; Stroben et al., 2016; Watters et al., 2015).

#### Self-efficacy is the only portable outcome. It increases motivation, learning goals, and critical skills. Simulating political processes is a prerequisite to developing it.

5\. Discussion and conclusion

[Role-play simulations of political decision-making are the most common
active learning method used for teaching about complex, dynamic
political processes]{.underline} (Ishiyama, 2013; Smith & Boyer, 1996).
To date, **[research has tentatively shown that simulations, including
MUN simulations, are beneficial for student learning]{.underline}**
(Baranowski & Weir, 2015; Crossley-Frolick, 2010; Obendorf & Randerson,
2013; Schech et al., 2017). **[We consider self-efficacy to be an
important learning outcome because it plays a key role in motivating
students to improve their competences and future actions, and because it
is associated with student success, as it positively influences academic
achievement, student motivation and regulative learning
outcomes]{.underline}** (Bandura, 1997; Pajares, 1996; Richardson et
al., 2012; Robbins et al., 2004; Schunk & Pajares, 2005; van Dinther et
al., 2011; Vermunt & Donche, 2017; Zimmerman, 2000). [Since
self-efficacy contributes to persistence, resilience and the overcoming
of difficulties]{.underline} (Bandura, 1997; Cassidy, 2015; Pajares,
1996), all of which are required during the negotiation process
(Spector, 2006), self-efficacy in negotiating is a relevant outcome on
which to focus. Because of the complexity of factors that come into play
during such simulations, research should take the simulation process
into account more often (Duchatelet et al., 2019; Usherwood, 2015).
[This study contributes to disentangling the simulation process by
investigating how student variation in the development of self-efficacy
in negotiating can be explained over the time period of a four-day
simulation]{.underline}. Moreover, it is innovative as it includes
social aspects of the simulation as explanatory factors, alongside other
individual characteristics.

As expected, **[self-efficacy in negotiating increased as the simulation
process progressed]{.underline}** (Hypothesis 1) (Duchatelet, 2018;
Cassidy & Eachus, 2002; Tang et al., 2004). However, the level of
development can be considered minor and tentative. In this respect, we
should take into account that [four days is a relatively short period of
time,]{.underline} and that the measurements followed each other after
relatively short periods, sometimes with only two hours between them.
Nevertheless, [the results thereby indicate the dynamic feature of
self-efficacy development, which can change within a few
hours]{.underline}. The findings revealed that time does not extensively
contribute to explaining variation in self-efficacy development, while
individual student characteristics more substantially predicted
variation in self-efficacy development.

Notably, the amount of perceived student cohesiveness significantly
explained variation in self-efficacy development -- even to the largest
extent (Hypothesis 2a). This confirms the importance of the social
dimension in self-efficacy development in role-play simulations (e.g.
Egenberg et al., 2016). The results also confirmed that male students
report higher self-efficacy (Hypothesis 2b), similar to previous
research findings (e.g. Duchatelet et al., 2018; Schunk & Pajares,
2008). Surprisingly, the analysis showed that the participants' level of
MUN experience did not relate to the amount of reported self-efficacy in
negotiating (Hypothesis 2c). How might this be explained? Firstly, it
might be related to the measures used. Self-efficacy beliefs are not so
much shaped by the experience itself but rather by how students
perceived the experience (Usher & Pajares, 2008). However, when asking
students about previous MUN experience in this study, only the quantity
(how many times) and not the quality (success or failure) of previous
experiences was taken into account. Secondly, contextual conditions
could complicate the transfer of self-efficacy beliefs from one
simulation to another. Students usually act out different roles in
different simulations, each simulation focuses on a different topic, and
students have to collaborate with different students each time. Finally,
the amount of time that had passed between MUN experiences might also
have had an effect on student self-efficacy beliefs.

When interpreting our findings, some limitations must be taken into
account. Firstly, although a linear model best fit the data, individual
plots did not show clear upward linear trends. In this quantitative
study, the concept of self-efficacy in negotiating was measured using a
five-point Likert scale. To capture even smaller changes when looking
for trends in self-efficacy development, it might be beneficial for
future quantitative research to use a seven-point or even nine-point
Likert scale. Secondly, a recent review study by Duchatelet et al.
(2019), points to contextual conditions of role-play simulations of
political decision-making that vary to a large extent. Simulations over
several days are often characterized by both formal and informal
negotiations. Formal committee meetings usually include chaired debates,
speechmaking, committee work and amendments, while informal negotiations
take place in and around the simulation setting in the form of
caucusing, the use of chat platforms and discussions over meals/coffee
breaks and between days.

Collecting data after each committee meeting hindered us from
distinguishing the contribution of different types of negotiation
setting to the development of self-efficacy. This distinction might be
helpful when further exploring gender differences. For example,
Rosenthal et al. (2001) showed that male MUN participants reported
significantly more enjoyment of the individual activities of debate,
passage and/or defeat of resolutions than female MUN participants, who
take considerably fewer speaking turns. Is it possible that female
students rely more extensively on sources of self-efficacy in
negotiating that are present in informal negotiation settings?

Finally, due to the informal gathering, students tended to participate
in the simulation in varying ways. For example, our response rate was
the lowest at Time Point 7, which was scheduled after the morning
session on the third day, which had been preceded by a pub crawl and
quiz on the previous evenings. Despite the fact that this aspect
complicates longitudinal data collection, it also raises the question of
the extent to which fatigue might influence the development of
self-efficacy in negotiating in simulations over several days.

With respect to further research, as the results point to variation in
the development of self-efficacy over time and individuals, it would be
useful to conduct further longitudinal research. For example, latent
class growth modelling might reveal clearer trends and allow the
detection of groups of students that follow similar growth trajectories
in self-efficacy development (Jung & Wickrama, 2008; Muthén & Muthén,
2000). This study showed that gender is a personal characteristic that
should be taken into account. Other personal features that might come
into play could be related to the level of ethnic and linguistic
diversity of simulation participants. It would be interesting, for
example, to investigate whether the availability and use of simultaneous
translation (as in the real world) contributes to student self-efficacy
in negotiating when participating as a non-native English speaker in a
simulation conducted in English. In addition, considering the large
contribution of perceived student cohesiveness found in this study, we
would suggest that this aspect is also measured longitudinally to
increase our understanding of its interplay with self-efficacy
development. Finally, a more person-centred approached is needed to
unravel the interplay of factors that influence self-efficacy
development; for example, by means of in-depth qualitative or mixed
methods research.

**[As a first practical implication, this study showed that
self-efficacy in negotiating is fostered in role-play simulations of
political decision-making, and thus it is a meaningful learning outcome
on which to focus]{.underline}**. By definition, [self-efficacy includes
the capacity to self-evaluate one's own abilities]{.underline} (Bandura,
1997), [which means that students are able to monitor and evaluate their
own progress.]{.underline} One way to support the development of
self-efficacy skills is self-assessment (Panadero, Jonsson, & Botolla,
2017). Teachers could implement self-assessment in the design of a
simulation which aims to promote the development of self-efficacy
skills, for example by using diaries that encourage students to reflect
on their negotiating. Assessing their own negotiation progress would
provide students with insights into their own performance, which in turn
would strengthen their self-efficacy and positively influence their
performance (Brown & Harris, 2013; Panadero et al., 2017).

**[As a second practical implication, the findings clearly point to the
importance of the social dimension of role-play simulations of political
decision-making]{.underline}**. Students who knew other students better,
or who perceived other students as being more helpful and supportive,
had significantly greater development in self-efficacy. Consequently,
teachers might take the student group composition into account more
explicitly. Also, teachers might choose for a longer/more intense
preparation phase in order for students to get to know each other
better. Student groups that are more familiar with each other and that
have already created a safe and supportive atmosphere might be more
beneficial to the development of self-efficacy in negotiating during
role-play simulations of political decision-making.

Being in a group of students who feel they have a lot in common with
each other might have a more powerful effect on a student's
self-efficacy beliefs through vicarious experience; for example, when
observing fellow delegates and evaluating their performance compared to
one's own. A group in which students are familiar with each other,
and/or in which other students are perceived as more experienced, might
help to shape self-efficacy through social persuasion, such as when
receiving compliments and feedback from other students. In this regard,
a third element that needs further consideration is the role of the
teacher during the simulation. Teacher feedback (feedback from an
expert) might significantly contribute to how self-efficacy in
negotiating develops during the simulation process and needs further
exploration.

[As a fourth practical implication, the findings raise questions about
performance assessment in role-play simulations of political
decision-making.]{.underline} As self-efficacy is related to performance
(Richardson et al., 2012), how might the group composition influence
student negotiation performance? [This study focused on an
extracurricular simulation, but many practical learning tasks are
course-based]{.underline} (Duchatelet et al., 2019). If the group
composition influences student negotiation performance, how should it
ideally be assessed? Should a simulation approach focus on conducting
several simulations in different student groups to create equal
opportunities for all students before assessing their negotiation
performance? Or should teachers strive for an optimal group composition?
Moreover, which elements would define such an 'optimal' group, and for
which students and which learning outcomes?

Overall, this study increased insight into the simulation process by
mapping how self-efficacy in negotiating developed over the period of a
four-day MUN simulation. Moreover, it showed how perceived student
cohesiveness, as a social factor, should be taken into account when
focusing on the development of self-efficacy in negotiating. Finally,
this social factor might also contribute to student negotiation
performance, which needs to be explored in future research about
performance assessment in role-play simulations of political
decision-making.

### Simulation Good---Decisionmaking Skills

#### Simulation based learning develops complex problem solving skills and allows students to engage with real world complexities. And, preparation and research improve results!

**[Knowledge application in more or less realistic situations has been
shown to be important for the development of complex
skills]{.underline}** (e.g., Kolodner, 1992). [Expertise development
theories]{.underline} (e.g., Van Lehn, 1996) [suggest that learners
acquire high levels of expertise in complex problem-solving tasks if
they dispose of sufficient prior knowledge and engage in a large amount
of practice.]{.underline} Practice **[opportunities ideally include
authentic problems related to a professional field]{.underline}** (e.g.,
Barab et al., 2000). However, in higher and further education
programs**[, the opportunity to engage in real-life problem solving is
limited]{.underline}**. In addition, practice in real-life situations
without systematic guidance can be overtaxing for students and come with
risks and ethical issues---for example, when working with real students
or patients without being systematically prepared. Moreover, [real-life
situations do not always provide enough practice opportunities as, for
example, critical situations appear less frequently or require a lot of
time before decisions lead to observable consequences]{.underline}.
[These limitations make practice in real-life situations a somewhat
inaccessible and sometimes suboptimal learning space, particularly for
novice learners.]{.underline} Therefore, **[approximations of practice
in which the complexity is reduced]{.underline}** (Grossman et al.,
2009) **[can help engage learners in specific aspects of professional
practice and are promising in order to avoid confusion and efficiently
use resources for learning and instruction]{.underline}**. [These
approximations]{.underline} of practice can be realized in higher
education with simulations, which allow students to use authentic
problems and also to create a learning environment to practice and
facilitate the acquisition of target complex skills (e.g., Cook, 2014).

Simulations are increasingly often used in higher education settings. In
STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education
(e.g., D'Angelo et al., 2014; Wu & Anderson, 2015), they are used to
facilitate a deeper understanding of concepts and relationships between
them, advance inquiry, problem solving, and decision making. A lot of
research has been done in the field of medical education (Cook, 2014;
Cook et al., 2013; Hegland et al., 2017), where simulations are used to
advance diagnostic competences and motor and technical skills of
prospective doctors, nurses, and emergency teams. Simulation-based
learning also occurs in other fields, such as teacher education,
engineering, and management (e.g., Alfred & Chung, 2011; Brubacher et
al., 2015). [The present meta-analysis focuses on higher education and,
more specifically, on fields that strongly rely on interaction with
other people at different levels]{.underline} (physical, cognitive,
social, etc.)---for example, medicine, nursing, psychological
counseling, management, teacher education, particular areas of
engineering, and economics. Regarding this area of interest, little is
known about for whom simulations are particularly helpful, what
scenarios are effective, and what additional instructional support makes
them effective for learners with different learning prerequisites.
Synthesized results on the role of different features of simulations
(e.g., duration, technology use) and instructional support (e.g.,
scaffolding) are lacking, especially with regard to effective support
for learners with different levels of prior knowledge. This
meta-analysis summarizes the effects of scaffolding and technology use
in simulation-based learning environments on facilitating a range of
complex skills across domains (e.g., medical and teacher education,
psychological counseling, care). In a previous meta-analysis, it has
been found that the effects of instruction across domains of medical and
teacher education have similar magnitude for a certain set of skills
related to diagnosing; the effects increase in magnitude with the proper
use of scaffolding (Chernikova et al., 2019). Other meta-analyses in the
field of medical education (e.g., Cook, 2014) support the idea that
simulations can be highly effective for advancing specific motor and
technical skills. However, knowledge is still scarce with regard to the
effective support to advance a variety of complex skills for learners
with different levels of prior knowledge. The present meta-analysis aims
at advancing this research by summarizing the effects of
simulation-based learning on complex skills---going beyond understanding
the subject matter and performing technical tasks. In addition, this
meta-analysis aims at differentiating the effects for learners on
different levels of prior knowledge.

To assess the effects of instructional support, this meta-analysis
adopts a scaffolding framework suggested by Chernikova et al. (2019).
The framework relies on defining scaffolding as support during working
on a task connected with a temporary shift of control over the learning
process from a learner to a teacher or learning environment (e.g., Tabak
& Kyza, 2018). The framework suggests that learners with different
levels of prior knowledge would benefit from different types of
scaffolding. More specifically, learners with high levels of prior
knowledge would benefit more from scaffolding that affords and requires
more self-regulation (e.g., inducing reflection phases), whereas
learners with a low level of prior knowledge would rather benefit from
more guidance (e.g., through examples).

Complex Skills in Higher Education

In higher education, students need to be prepared for their future
profession, and their professional competences should involve a range of
complex skills. The importance of 21st-century skills goes beyond
secondary education and is also often addressed during higher and
further education (e.g., P21, 2019). Critical thinking, problem solving,
communication, and collaboration seem to be the most relevant skills
that students should acquire during their education in addition to
domain-specific knowledge and skills to be able to make professional
decisions and implement solutions.

[According to Mayer (1992), problem solving in a broader sense is
cognitive processing aimed at achieving a goal when no solution path or
method is obvious. It involves critical thinking, monitoring, and
experimental interactions with the environment]{.underline} (Raven,
2000[), as well as directed application of knowledge to the case or
problem.]{.underline} Shin et al. (2003) emphasize the differences
between well- and ill-structured problems. **[Well-structured problems
present all elements of the problem, engage the application of a limited
number of rules and principles and possess correct, convergent
answers]{.underline}**. A good example of such problems would be finding
the predicate in a sentence, calculating drug dosage based on a
patient's weight, and so on. However, the real-world problems that
professionals across domains deal with are usually ill structured. In
turn, they fail to present one or more of the problem elements; might
have unclear goals; possess multiple solutions, solution paths, or
sometimes no solutions at all; or represent uncertainty about which
concepts, rules, and principles are necessary for the solution or how
they are organized (Funke, 2006; Shin et al., 2003). **[Problem solving
in this case might involve not only diagnosing but also managing
critical situations. By diagnosing, we understand collecting
case-specific information to reduce uncertainty]{.underline}**
(Heitzmann et al., 2019), such as diagnosing learning difficulties,
identifying the cause of a health problem, or developing a course of
action[. By managing critical situations we understand using the set of
skills required to behave in situations of emergency or uncertainty,
such as classroom management skills or emergency help with disasters or
accidents.]{.underline}

If the solution path is already known (e.g., a complex procedure with a
set of required steps needed to collect information or make a decision)
and needs to be accurately followed, we would rather address it as
technical/manual performance (an example from medical education would be
completing an examination or operation, in teacher education---carrying
out lesson activities according to a plan prepared in advance).

[To implement the decisions and solutions to problems as well as to
collect missing information, one also needs communication skills (e.g.,
to persuade others to help or to collect missing information from other
people]{.underline}; Raven, 2000). If multiple professionals are
involved in the situation and need to collaborate to solve the problem,
make the decision, or take action (e.g., an emergency team), we see it
as collaboration/teamwork skills.

To sum up, different professional domains require specific professional
knowledge as a prerequisite to enable the implementation of complex
skills; however, the complex skills required appear to be similar across
domains. **[One should be able to identify the problem, analyze the
context, and apply professional and experiential knowledge to make
practical decisions]{.underline}**. Fischer et al. (2014) suggested **[a
framework of epistemic activities that is relevant to a broad range of
problem-solving and decision-making procedures across domains:
identifying the problem, questioning, generating hypotheses,
constructing artifacts, generalizing and evaluating evidence, drawing
conclusions, and communicating processes and results.]{.underline}** In
this meta-analysis, focus on learning outcomes that involve these
epistemic activities, critical thinking, and problem solving are among
the most important eligibility criteria.

Simulations in Educational Contexts

**[Simulation-based learning offers learning with approximation of
practice, allows limitations of learning in real-life situations to be
overcome, and can be an effective approach to develop complex
skills]{.underline}**. Beaubien and Baker (2004) define a [simulation as
a tool that reproduces the real-life characteristics of an event or
situation]{.underline}. A more specific definition suggested by Cook et
al. (2013) stated that **[simulation is an "educational tool or device
with which the learner physically interacts to mimic real life" and in
which they emphasize "the necessity of interacting with authentic
objects"]{.underline}** (p. 876).

[What makes simulations educational tools is the opportunity to alter
and adjust some aspects of reality in a way that facilitates learning
and practicing]{.underline} (e.g., they address less frequent events,
shorten response time, provide immediate feedback to the learner, etc.).
Although feedback, as providing information about discrepancy of current
state (or behavior) and a desired goal stat (Hattie & Timperley, 2007),
plays an important role in designing simulation, there are much more
opportunities for instructional support. The present research aims at
exploring opportunities to provide additional information and
scaffolding to the learner in detail.

The operational definition of simulation includes interaction with a
real or virtual object, device, or person and the opportunity to alter
the flow of this interaction with the decisions and actions made by
learners (Heitzmann et al., 2019). [Thus, all types of interaction, from
**role plays** and standardized patients to highly immersive
interactions with virtual objects, can be considered
simulations.]{.underline}

**[The operational definition of simulation also implies that there is
critical thinking and a kind of problem solving that is present during
learning and learners take an active role in the skill development
processes.]{.underline}** [Simulations have many features to address the
complexity of real-world situations]{.underline} (Davidsson & Verhagen,
2017); for example, they can involve technology aids to better resemble
reality or to provide more practice or learning opportunities. However,
[the idea of simulation tends to focus on the reconstruction of
realistic situations and the genuine interactions that participants can
participate in.]{.underline} According to Grossman et al. (2009),
simulation can be viewed as a simplified version of practice and be used
to engage novices in practices that are more or less proximal to the
practices of a profession. Therefore, it seems reasonable to
additionally focus on the duration of simulation and authenticity in
order to determine how realistic the learning environment was and how
long the learners were exposed to it.

Another aspect that needs to be considered is the type of simulation,
which can be categorized according to what or who learners interact with
(real or virtual object or person). The type of simulation is related to
the concept of information base (e.g., where the information for
decisions comes from) as a context variable (Chernikova et al., 2019;
Heitzmann et al., 2019) but provides a further categorization into real
or virtual object (e.g., document, tool, model) and real or virtual
person (e.g., standardized patients).

Technology use refers to the application of digital media (hardware and
software) to establish a learning environment. In class, role plays,
simulated discussions, and communication with standardized patients can
be seen as simulations without technology use, as no software or
hardware is necessary to initiate the interaction (e.g., Davidsson &
Verhagen, 2017). Screen-based simulations require computer-supported
interfaces and some software, which allows the interaction (e.g., Biese
et al., 2009). Another type is interaction supported by combining some
hardware with software, such as in a programmed mannequin (Liaw et al.,
2014). One more type that requires complex technology is virtual
reality, which is likely to facilitate immersion (e.g., Ahlberg et al.,
2007). Empirical research on the effects of technology use on learning
(comparing the use of computers in the classroom with no technology)
provides some supportive evidence of small to moderate positive effects
of technology use on learning and achievement (Hattie, 2003; Tamim et
al., 2011). Some evidence of no particular effects of technology use
comes from medical education comparing high- and low-fidelity
simulations for learning (e.g., Ahad et al., 2013). Systematic empirical
evidence of the effects of virtual reality is lacking due to the fact
that virtual reality is rather new technology and is not yet broadly
implemented in classrooms. The aim of this meta-analysis is to summarize
the effects of different technologies on acquiring complex skills.

Duration of simulation refers to the time of exposure to a learning
environment. In their meta-analysis, Cook et al. (2013) provided
supportive evidence of the effectiveness of distributed and repetitive
practice (effects above .60) in the acquisition of complex skills in
medical education. However, they only focused on comparing simulations
with a duration of more than 1 day with simulations of less than 1 day.
Therefore, as a next step a meta-analysis might be aimed at capturing
the effects of the duration of simulations on a more detailed scale
(including simulations lasting for several minutes, hours, days, weeks,
or semesters).

[**Simulation-based learning allows reality to be brought closer into
schools and universities.** Learners can take over certain roles and act
in a hands-on (and heads-on) way in a simulated professional
context.]{.underline} Research has shown that full authenticity is not
always beneficial for learning (e.g., Henninger & Mandl, 2000).
[Researchers therefore typically emphasize the opportunity to modify
reality for learning purposes with simulated environments]{.underline}.
Therefore, it is important to consider the extent to which simulation
represents the actual practice in terms of demands set on the learner,
the nature of the simulated situation, and the environment and/or the
participants involved (e.g., Allen et al., 1991). Sometimes this
relationship is addressed as fidelity of the simulation. However, a
recent review by Hamstra et al. (2014) emphasized that there are severe
inconsistencies in using this term in different research areas. In line
with recommendations given by this group of authors (Hamstra et al.,
2014), we focus on functional correspondence between a simulated
scenario or the simulator itself and the context of real situations. We
address this correspondence by estimating the degree of authenticity,
and in this way, we avoid the term fidelity and the uncertainty related
with it.

Prior Knowledge and Professional Development

[Prior knowledge is an important predictor of learning
success]{.underline} (e.g., Ausubel, 1968); [it can also define the
ability of learners to learn from particular materials, and use learning
strategies.]{.underline} There are considerations suggesting that
including simulations in a later phase of a higher education program
after students already know theoretical concepts is promising in order
to not overwhelm learners and block too much of their cognitive capacity
for solving a problem in a simulation (e.g., Kirschner et al., 2006).
Other considerations suggest including simulations at a very early point
because this supports the process of restructuring knowledge into higher
order concepts that can be used directly to solve problems (e.g.,
Boshuizen & Schmidt, 2008; Schmidt & Boshuizen, 1993; Schmidt & Rikers,
2007). Thus, a theoretical knowledge base would be stored in a more
effective way that is directly linked to cases of application (e.g.,
Kolodner, 1992[). Nonetheless, it seems rather obvious that learners
with less theoretical prior knowledge may need more instructional
guidance than more advanced learners in order to still possess enough
cognitive resources for learning]{.underline} (e.g., Schmidt et al.,
2007).

Discussion

The results of this meta-analysis show that **[simulation-based learning
has large positive overall effects on the advancement of a broad range
of complex skills and across a broad range of different domains in
higher education]{.underline}**. [The size of the effect of simulations
on learning even exceeds the expectedly large influence of the learners'
prior knowledge]{.underline}. The effect size is still very large when
simulation-based learning is compared with different kinds of
instruction instead of "real" control groups, including waiting
controls. There is only a very small number of instructional methods for
which these relations hold true. These include feedback and formative
assessment (see Hattie, 2003; Hattie & Timperley, 2007), which already
point to possible interpretations of effects that large. [One of the
issues in higher education is the lack of feedback in the context of
complex authentic activities. Simulations typically address exactly this
issue. They often entail providing information to the learner on the
discrepancy of currently observable competence indicators and a desired
competence goal, which is one of the most common definitions of feedback
in the context of learning]{.underline} (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). The
potential of simulations for learning has been known for a while in
medical education (e.g., Cook, 2014) but is now increasingly transferred
(and sometimes reinvented) to other domains of higher education (see
Heitzmann et al., 2019). This meta-analysis provides supportive evidence
that the large effects of simulation-based learning found for medical
knowledge and skills do generalize across domains.

[But simulations are more than just feedback as they provide
opportunities for meaningful applications of knowledge to professional
problems]{.underline} (Grossman et al., 2009). Simulated problems may be
tailored to the needs of learners as an approximation of practice and
are thus probably often more effective than real practice.

With regard to types of simulation, the analysis shows that combining
several types of simulation over the treatment time---for example, role
play with practice on a model (Dumont et al., 2016) or virtual reality
(Lehmann et al., 2013)---might have greater effects on learning. We have
also identified that some types of simulation are more frequently used
to target particular complex skills. For example, [communication skills
are frequently facilitated through role plays,]{.underline} whereas
technical performance is frequently addressed by using a simulator or
virtual reality. Therefore, we would like to emphasize that the
simulation type should not be viewed independently of target skills and
instructional support quality. The type of simulation depends a lot on
the learning context (e.g., radiologists have to work with images,
teachers with students' tests), but providing different types of
simulations can be beneficial across domains.

The present meta-analysis included different types of complex skills as
outcome measures. The analysis yielded evidence of differences with
respect to facilitating effects that are considerably bigger than the
differences between the effects of the domains involved. The biggest
effect sizes were obtained for tasks related to technical performance
that mainly come from medicine (Araújo et al., 2014; Banks et al.,
2007), followed by problem-solving and -diagnosing skills. [These
findings emphasize that if the simulation requires the coordinated use
of different mental modes and abilities---for example, motor and sensory
skills together with reasoning---the learning gains are larger than for
simulations that require the involvement of fewer skills.]{.underline}
Despite these differences, simulations had effects that can be
categorized as large positive effects for all but one type of skill. The
exception is teamwork, where the meta-analysis found a medium positive
effect only. This in turn may be due to the high complexity in the case
of real team training. Another explanation of low effects is that it
might be difficult to find ways to further improve social skills, as
they are by far the most trained skills we possess.

[There has been a long debate on political and societal levels around
the question of an added value of technologies for learning]{.underline}
(cf. Rogers, 2001). According to this meta-analysis, simulations still
have substantial effects if no digital technology is used at all.
Typical computer-and-screen-based simulations do not outperform
well-organized no-tech role plays and simulated patients or simulated
students. Both of them, [the technology-enhanced and the no-tech
variants do have large effects.]{.underline} However, some more recent
technologies that enhance sensory perception (e.g., virtual reality,
full-scale simulators) seem to make a difference. With more studies and
better theory, it will be possible to identify features and dimensions
of these technologies that are responsible for greater learning gains.

**[Another main finding of this meta-analysis is certainly that
simulations with an overall high authenticity do have greater effects
than simulations with a lower authenticity]{.underline}**. However, it
is also very interesting that even simulations with low authenticity
still have large effect sizes, exceeding those of many other forms of
instruction. This is encouraging for higher education practice as
high-authenticity simulations are sometimes very expensive and
time-consuming to build. [At least for learners with some experience of
the real situation, a reduced version might do just as well in low- as
in high-authenticity simulations.]{.underline} Moreover, simulations
aimed at high authenticity for only one or a small number of objects and
processes are associated with effects similar to the effects of
simulations aimed at high authenticity with respect to all situational
parameters[. This can be taken as supportive evidence of the
approximation-of-practice approach]{.underline} (Grossman et al., 2009),
**[claiming that the real advantage in simulations is the reduction of
task complexity to levels a learner can handle.]{.underline}**

## Anti-Blackness

### Clash Turns Case---Vanguard Thought---1NC

#### Switch-side debates over hypothetical political action is key to cultivate [vanguard thought]{.underline}. Prioritizing [ideological consistency]{.underline} in debate [fractures]{.underline} revolutionary intercommunalism by encouraging [dogmatic abstraction]{.underline}, which is [colonial]{.underline} and [anti-Black]{.underline}.

University (Jim, "Huey Newton's Lessons for the Academic Left," Theory,
Culture & Society, Vol 38, Issue 7-8, 2021, dml) \[brackets in
original\]

In short, Newton and Seale found that their 'hook-up with white radicals
did not give \[them\] access to the white community because they did not
guide the white community' outside the university (Newton and Morrison,
2009: 51), just as they had 'problems with black students sometimes
because they tend to have a detached understanding of the realities in
the black community' off campus (Seale, 1991: 211). Their continual and
withering critique of 'intellectual jivers ... who sit in a fucking
armchair and try to articulate the revolution while black people are
dying in the streets' at times appears as a standard call by grassroots
activists to place the pressing needs of concrete praxis before the
leisurely pursuit of abstract theory (Seale, 1991: 119, 33); and,
indeed, Newton claims 'when Bobby and I left Merritt College to organize
brothers on the block we did so because the college students were too
content to sit around and analyze without acting' (Newton and Morrison,
2009: 99). However, [Newton was **far from opposed** to]{.underline}
even highly speculative [theorizing]{.underline}; he would, after all,
routinely open talks by asking his audience 'to assume that an external
world exists' before they could procced (Hilliard and Weise, 2002:
162).4 [His disillusionment]{.underline} with academic activists [was
not due to the **complexity** or **abstraction** necessary for
theoretical debate]{.underline}; [on the contrary]{.underline}, it was
grounded in his experience that 'when I speak on college campuses ... I
try to lead an audience into rational and logical discussions, but [many
students are looking for **rhetoric** and
**phrasemongering**]{.underline}' instead, [which]{.underline} he felt
[indicated]{.underline} in his audiences [not only an **evasion** of
potentially **valid**]{.underline}, [and thus **needed**]{.underline},
[criticism of their own views]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} an
**[implicit elitism]{.underline}** concerning off-campus participants in
political discourse; as he put it, the students 'either do not want to
learn or they do not believe that I can think' (Newton, 2009: 68).

Of course, [Newton]{.underline} agreed with the white mother country
radicals that the fight for black liberation was 'in essence ... not at
all a race struggle \[but a\] struggle between the massive proletarian
working class and the small, minority ruling class' (Seale, 1991: 72);
simultaneously, because that class remained internally divided by race
and racism, he also held that 'nationalism is recognized by many who
think in a revolutionary manner as a distinct and natural stage through
which one proceeds', explaining, among other things, the Party's
anti-integrationist stance (Harrison, 1970: 151). He thus [affirmed the
necessity of developing a discourse that would]{.underline} 'not
only ... [make]{.underline} Blacks more proud but ... make [whites
**question** and]{.underline} even [**reject** concepts they had
**always unthinkingly accepted**]{.underline}' (Newton, 2009: 175),
which required synthesizing race- and class-based theories of the
numerous contradictions that structured social life. His experience with
campus [radicals]{.underline}, however, led him to believe that their
[goal]{.underline}, [by contrast]{.underline}, [was to find]{.underline}
'a set of actions and [a set of [principles that are **easy to
identify** and]{.mark} are **[absolute]{.mark}**]{.underline}[']{.mark}
(Newton et al., 2004: 84), [which not only **deepened** the distance
between progressive theorists and those most in need of emancipatory
thought]{.underline}, [but [encouraged]{.mark} those in [elite positions
to **instruct**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[rather than]{.mark} to
**[engage]{.mark} with** and **listen to**]{.underline}, [those in whose
name they purportedly spoke]{.underline}. For Newton, [to]{.underline}
'attempt to [explain phenomena]{.underline} ... [by taking]{.underline}
\[[them]{.underline}\] [out of]{.underline} \[[their
concrete]{.underline}\] [environment]{.underline},
\[[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}\] [putting them into a
category]{.underline} ... without understanding everything else related
to them' [was to]{.underline} '**[[transform]{.underline}]{.mark}**'
[material]{.underline}, [[lived realities into]{.mark} **reified
[abstractions]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} **inevitably** produced forms of
praxis that [imposed]{.mark} demands for an **[impossible ideological
purity]{.mark}** on a suffering populace living in a nest
of]{.underline} economic, biological, psychological, and social
[contradictions]{.underline} (Hilliard and Weise, 2002: 163). This is
why [Newton]{.underline} '[tried not to speak in]{.underline} such
[absolute]{.underline} ... [terms]{.underline}' [and emphasized the need
for theorists to]{.underline} '**[analyse each instance]{.underline}**',
[rather than subsuming them under [an **abstract**]{.mark} and **rigid
[model]{.mark}** [treated as]{.mark}]{.underline} '[[an **infallible
guide in all cases**]{.underline}]{.mark}' (Newton et al., 2004: 26); as
his thinking developed, [he]{.underline} increasingly [cautioned against
theorizing that]{.underline} '[**does not apply** to the present set of
conditions]{.underline} \[[because it [is]{.mark}]{.underline}\] [[tied
to]{.underline}]{.mark} a set of thoughts that approaches
**[[dogma]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- what we call flunkeyism' (Hilliard
and Weise, 2002: 165).

In fact, [while it may seem counterintuitive given the militant
positions the Panthers routinely struck]{.underline} in public, [for
Newton]{.underline}, [the tendency]{.underline} among activists emerging
from the academy [to **rigidly**]{.underline}
'**[draw]{.underline}** ... [[the **line of
demarcation**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [saying [**you are on this side**
and **I am on the other**]{.mark}]{.underline} ... [shows a **lack of
consciousness**]{.underline}' [of the situation to be
theorized]{.underline} (Newton, 2009: 62); not least because [it
[is]{.mark} grounded in [the same]{.mark} sort of **[absolute
distinction]{.mark}** between]{.underline} the '[good]{.underline}'
human beings, cultures, and values [and]{.underline} their
'[evil]{.underline}' inversion or absence [[that **defined the colonial
mindset**]{.underline}]{.mark} that black power and socialist
internationalism were each formed to oppose. He reminds us that:

The African gods south of the Sahara always had at least two heads, one
for good and one for evil. Now people make gods in their own
image ... So the African said, in effect, I am both good and evil; good
and evil are the two parts of the thing that is me. This is an example
of an internal contradiction.

Western societies split up good and evil, placing God up in heaven and
the devil down below. Good and evil fight for control over people in
Western religions, but they are two entirely different entities. (Newton
et al., 2004: 24)

While the Manichean politics he encountered from both white and black
campus-based activists resonates strongly with the struggle of the Good
to control, instruct, or conquer the Evil, Newton's own theorizing was
based on the recognition 'that all things are in a constant state of
change, transformation, or flux' (Hilliard and Weise, 2002: 163),
because of 'the internal contradictions in all things', including the
people themselves (Newton et al., 2004: 108). It is precisely for this
reason that Newton, above all, endorses a dialectical5 understanding of
social change:

This struggle of mutually exclusive opposing tendencies within
everything that exists explains the observable fact that [all
things]{.underline} ... [are in a constant state of
transformation]{.underline}. Things transform themselves because while
one tendency or force is more dominating than another, change is
nonetheless a constant, and [at some point the balance will **alter**
and there will be a new qualitative development]{.underline} ... Now,
because things do not stay the same [we can be **sure** of one
thing]{.underline}: [the owner **will not stay** the owner]{.underline},
[and the]{.underline} people who are [dominated **will not stay**
dominated]{.underline}. [We don't know **exactly** how this will
happen]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} ... [we can be **sure** that if
we **increase the intensity** of the struggle]{.underline} (which is
already underway), [we will reach a point where the equilibrium of
forces will **change** and there will be a]{.underline} qualitative
[**leap** into a new situation with a new social
equilibrium]{.underline}. (pp. 25--26)

Thus, above all, what Newton wanted to teach the academic-led Left, is
that [[a genuine vanguard **does not reprovingly instruct** the
people]{.mark} as to **[what they should will]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[how they should struggle]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[or **what their
personal shortcomings** are in the light of]{.mark} **externally
developed**]{.underline}, **[inflexible]{.underline}**, [and **[absolute
models]{.mark}**]{.underline} or principles; [it must
proceed]{.underline}, rather, [from]{.underline} a 'great compassion for
people' (Newton et al., 2004: 54), or an **[understanding]{.underline}**
of, [and **empathy**]{.underline} with, their inherently conflicted
lives and communities. As he puts it, 'the Black Panther Party is not
based upon hate. We feel that \[a\] revolutionary program must be guided
by a feeling of love -- armed love we sometimes call it', premised upon
the 'involvement and acceptance' of the people not only at every stage,
but more importantly 'as they are' in their flawed, internally
contradictory state (Newton et al., 2004: 50). It is thus as much, and
perhaps even more, the academic Left as the administrative Right that
Newton has in mind when he laments that:

I don't think students are taught dialectically, and one of the reasons
they are not is that it would be detrimental to the bourgeois
educational system to do so. I think that it is a fair statement to say
that the schools are agencies of the status quo: ... it would be
detrimental to them to give students the tools to show \[the people\]
that the status quo cannot stand and \[thus\] to analyze them out of
existence. (Newton et al., 2004: 87)

Thus, while affirming the need for radical thought to emerge from spaces
like the university, which can help clarify and guide the people in
their ongoing efforts to resolve the contradictions of their lives, he
simultaneously and strenuously warns that [when radical theorists
**distance** themselves from the community and begin to traffic in
**moral** and **political absolutes**]{.underline}, [they can easily
slip into]{.underline} what he called '**[revolutionary
cultism]{.underline}**'; a temptation into which he admits he fell at
various points in the Party's development.

The revolutionary cultist uses the words of social change ... but his
actions are so far divorced from the process of revolution and
organizing the community that he is living in a fantasy world. So [we
**talk** to each other]{.underline} on campuses ... [thinking these
things will produce change **without the people
themselves**]{.underline}. Of course [people]{.underline} do courageous
things and [**call** themselves the **vanguard**]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} ... [vanguard means **spearhead**]{.underline}, [and
the spearhead **has to spearhead something**]{.underline}. If nothing is
behind it, then it is divorced from the masses and is not the vanguard.
(Newton and Morrison, 2009: 70--71)6

[[What was required]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [[was **not**]{.mark} so
much]{.underline} an emphasis on [[praxis over
theory]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[specifically]{.underline}]{.mark}** dialectical mode of synthesizing
theory and practice that 'emphasizes [a **[concrete analysis of
conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline}' [[within **actual
communities**]{.underline}]{.mark} and [which might]{.underline} help
[lay the foundation for]{.underline} '[an **appropriate
response**]{.underline} to these conditions as a way of mobilizing the
people and leading them to higher levels of consciousness' (Newton and
Morrison, 2009: 49). As he puts it toward the end of his statement
expelling Eldridge Cleaver from the Party for

influencing us to isolate ourselves from the Black community so that it
was war between the oppressor and the Black Panther Party, not war
between the oppressor and the oppressed community ... Our dialectical
ideology and our analysis of concrete conditions indicate that
[declaring a spontaneous revolution is a **fantasy**]{.underline}. [The
people are **not at that point** now]{.underline}. This contradiction
and conflict may seem unfortunate to some, but it is part of the
dialectical process. (pp. 51, 53)

For Newton, the structural oppression that communities endure
necessitates both that the people are driven to resist and transform
their suppressed circumstances (which we can call their 'good') and that
'the opinions of the [people have]{.underline} ... [been molded and
directed **against** their true interests]{.underline} by slick
politicians and exploitative educators \[whose\] diversion tactics often
lead the people down blind alleys or onto tangents that take them away
from their true goals' (which thus reflects their 'evil') (p. 57,
emphasis added); and [it is these [**internally contradictory**
people]{.mark}]{.underline} -- **[[not reified
abstractions]{.underline}]{.mark}** of them -- [whose situation
[requires]{.mark} **concrete [analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline} and to
whom this theorizing must ultimately be directed. This, of course,
retains radical theory's traditional goal of providing a compelling
critique of the structures which have distorted the lives and opinions
of the people; but such [critiques can **only** be]{.underline} both
accurate to the community at issue, and more importantly [relevant to
emancipatory praxis]{.underline}, [if they]{.underline} simultaneously
[learn from]{.underline} the [people so as]{.underline} [not to
impose]{.underline} upon them **[[externally
developed]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[inflexibly
applied]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and thus [**elite**
demands]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[leav]{.mark}ing [them prey to]{.mark}
organizing by [**reactionary leaders** who speak **more
directly**]{.mark} to their flawed lives and immediate
needs]{.underline}.

Newton's Conception of a Theoretical Vanguard

Vanguard theory, Newton argues, must therefore proceed from the
recognition that '**[revolution is a process]{.underline}**' (Newton and
Morrison, 2009: 57, emphasis in original), one [which unfolds
**progressively over**]{.underline} an extended period of [**time**
as]{.underline} the [people]{.underline} themselves come to
[increasingly identify and struggle for their true
interests]{.underline}. [[Theorists]{.underline}]{.mark}, he therefore
argued, [can offer **essential aid** in guiding this process of
collective self-determination]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} in order
to do so, they '[[**cannot** offer]{.mark} the people
**[conclusions]{.mark}**]{.underline}[']{.mark} (Newton and Morrison,
2009: 57, emphasis added) [[regarding the]{.mark} **utopian
[state]{.mark}** [to be achieved]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the **form of
subjectivity**]{.underline}]{.mark}, culture, or contribution
[[required]{.mark} to pursue it]{.underline}, [[or the]{.mark}
**absolute [principles]{.mark}** upon which progressive change
rests]{.underline}, [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} '[when the revolutionary
begins to indulge in]{.underline} ... **[final
conclusions]{.underline}**, [[the people **do not
relate**]{.underline}]{.mark} to him. Therefore he is no longer a
revolutionary' (p. 47); because the 'only time an action is
revolutionary is when the people relate to it in a revolutionary way',
theorists 'must be ready to respond creatively to new conditions and new
understandings' that emerge from the people themselves as they
progressively struggle to determine their own destiny (pp. 48, 57).

Theorizing thus remains necessary because [revolutionary struggle
**requires**]{.underline} the critical determination and articulation of
the contradictions that dominate social relations, as well as the
development of speculative forms of praxis directed at their resolution;
but Newton reminds us that 'these contradictions should be resolved in
the community', rather than by purported experts or representatives, for
only this makes social change genuinely progressive by grounding it in
the actualized will of the people (Newton et al., 2004: 47). Thus as it
'tries to show the people the way to resolve these problems ... the
vanguard has to include all the people', and the people as internally
contradictory, in **[both]{.underline}** their [**theoretical analysis**
and **practical recommendations**]{.underline}. Because, as he laments,
'it will take time to resolve the contradictions of racism and all kinds
of chauvinism' (p. 33), and because only the people themselves can
genuinely resolve them, Newton believed [the]{.underline} vanguard's
[**essential task** was to **determine**]{.underline},
**[articulate]{.underline}**, [and **help build political programs**
that]{.underline} 'increase the positive qualities \[or 'good'\]' in the
people 'until they dominate the negative \[or 'evil'\] and therefore
[**transform** the situation]{.underline}' (Newton and Morrison, 2009:
101).

Of course, because the people are not only externally manipulated, but
internally enmeshed in varied contradictions, those working to determine
these programs often benefit from a partial remove from the
circumstances they seek to study. While the
**[[university]{.underline}]{.mark}** is not the only institution that
can fulfil the role, **[[spaces]{.underline}]{.mark}** like it, [[where
**speculative thought**]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[grounded
in]{.underline}]{.mark}** even quite esoteric
**[[research]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[can]{.mark} be]{.underline} both
[**[develop]{.mark}ed** and **forwarded for**]{.underline} vigorous and
**[[rigorous debate]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[are **needed** so that a
**vanguard thought**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- one ahead of the people in
its vision and thus [which may help **intensify** and **further**
the]{.underline} people's [struggle for]{.underline} their own
**[liberation]{.underline}** -- [[can]{.mark} be
**[develop]{.mark}ed**]{.underline}. Thus, what we typically (perhaps
crudely) call 'critical theory' is perennially required because, as
Newton puts it, if there is no-one to 'make the people aware of the
tools and methods of liberation, there will be no means by which the
people can mobilize' for their interests (Newton and Morrison, 2009:
15); however, such critical [theorizing will **only** be]{.underline}
'**[accepted as valid]{.underline}**' by its ultimate target if [it not
only]{.underline} '[delivers a **true understanding**]{.underline} of
the phenomena which affect the lives of the people', [but]{.underline}
moreover [reflects and nurtures what the people **as they currently
are**]{.underline}, [are **currently willing to contribute** to the
practical resolution of social contradictions]{.underline}; only this
marks a truly vanguard thinking, or what Newton calls a 'philosophy
which will help orient us toward goals which are in the true interests
of the people' (pp. 58--59).

One might say, then, that what [Newton is suggesting]{.underline} is
that 'critical theory' is in fact better understood as [a **collection
of [competing hypotheses]{.mark}**]{.underline} concerning both the
contradictions [that]{.underline} determine social life and the modes of
their redress. As in empirical science, such hypotheses [are [developed
out of **limited evidence**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and thus
are]{.underline} often [**highly speculative** or **diverge** in
**sharply contrasting ways**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} before
confirmation [[have the tendency of forming into]{.underline}]{.mark}
competing, sometimes quite [**rigid** and **[dogmatic]{.mark}** schools
of [thought]{.mark}]{.underline}; consequently, [these]{.underline}
hypotheses, much like scientific ones, [can only]{.underline} really
[become theories by **testing them** against the relevant data
set]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} in the case of revolutionary or
emancipatory thought [can only be the **people**
themselves]{.underline}, [who will decide whether it **reflects** or
**guides** their struggle to collectively determine their own interests
by mobilizing themselves]{.underline} to transform their immediately
lived situation. While he does not quite put things this bluntly, this
is one way of grasping the following passage from his famous speech on
BPP ideology delivered to students at Boston College:

I would like to give you a **[[framework]{.underline}]{.mark}** or a
process of thinking that **[[might help]{.mark} us solve]{.underline}**
the **[problems]{.underline}** and the contradictions that exist today.
[Before we approach the problem we must [get a **clear picture**]{.mark}
of what is really going on]{.underline}; a clear image [[**divorced**
from]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[attitudes]{.mark} and
emotions]{.underline} that we usually project into a situation. [[We
must be **as objective as possible without accepting
dogma**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [letting the facts **speak for
themselves**]{.underline}. But we will not remain totally objective; [we
will become subjective in the **application** of the knowledge received
from the external world]{.underline}. We will use the scientific method
to acquire this knowledge, but we will openly acknowledge our ultimate
subjectivity. Once we apply knowledge in order to will a certain outcome
our objectivity ends and our subjectivity begins. We call this
integrating theory and practice, and this is what the Black Panther
Party is all about. (Newton and Morrison, 2009: 23)

This suggests that, [if the goal of]{.underline} political [theorizing
is]{.underline}, as Newton suggests, '[to increase our]{.underline}
\[[collective]{.underline}\] [ability to **deal** with]{.underline}
\[[the real]{.underline}\] [world [and]{.mark} **shape** its
development]{.underline}' in a progressive manner (Newton et al., 2004:
26), then [it must be]{.underline} as **[[open to
critique]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[and **revision**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the light of its social
reception as work in the empirical sciences is in light of experimental
evidence. This, at least, seems to be how Chicago chapter Chairman Fred
Hampton understood the nature of the BPP's legendary breakfast program:

Our Breakfast for Children program is feeding a lot of children and
\[so\] the people understand our Breakfast for Children program. We
sayin' something like this -- we sayin' that theory's cool, but theory
with no practice ain't shit. You've got to have both of them -- the two
go together. We have a theory about feeding kids free. What'd we do? We
put it into practice. That's how people learn. A lot of people don't
know how serious this thing is ... What are we doing? ... we are running
it in a socialistic manner. People came and took our program, saw it in
a socialistic fashion not even knowing it was socialism. People are
gonna take our program and tell us to go on to a higher level. They
gonna take the program and work it in a socialistic manner ... We been
educating \[them\], not by reading matter, but through observation and
participation. By letting \[them\] come and work in our program. Not
theory and theory alone, but theory and practice. The two go
together ... This is what the Black Panther Party is about. (Hampton,
1970: 139, emphases added)

[Theorizing the emancipation of the people is]{.underline} thus
[**incompatible** with the cultist drive to compel them]{.underline} --
say, through the pressures of social shame or physical threat -- [to
accept **independently developed conclusions**]{.underline}, [for
this]{.underline} effectively [amounts to **replacing** their current
masters with self-proclaimed superior ones]{.underline}; as Newton
continually reminds us, 'this is something we have to make quite clear:
[eliminating the controller and assuming the place of the controller are
two different things]{.underline}' (Newton et al., 2004: 101). While
[theorists]{.underline} from the academy and elsewhere [can and should
play a vital role in both]{.underline} social [critique and]{.underline}
pragmatic [organizing]{.underline}, they can do so [**only** if they
accept that]{.underline} '[we **can't jump** from A to Z]{.underline},
[we have to go through all of the development]{.underline}
\[[because]{.underline}\] the [people tend not to take]{.underline}
\[[even]{.underline}\] [**one** step higher]{.underline}; [they take
**half** a step]{.underline} higher ... this is how we move to higher
levels' (Newton and Morrison, 2009: 71). The job of vanguard theory,
then, is essentially to 'find out what the people will do and
\[determine ways to\] get them to do that much' (p. 141).

Newton's own concept of '**[[revolutionary
intercommunalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**' arose from his conviction that
sweeping technological change and global economic integration have
ensured that 'nations no longer exist. Nor ... will they ever exist
again' (Newton et al., 2004: 31). This, he hypothesized, necessitated a
break with the cultural revolution favoured by the nationalists, because
it is no longer possible for Europe's former 'colonies \[to\] decolonize
and return to their original existence as nations'; it also meant
abandoning the revolutionary internationalism favoured by the socialists
because, in his view, American empire had 'transformed itself into a
power controlling all the lands and people' across the globe. Because
nations had effectively been rendered obsolete, Newton argued that 'the
world today is \[best understood as\] a dispersed collection of
communities', which he defined as 'a small unit with a comprehensive
collection of institutions that exist to serve a small group of people',
although the enduring influence of varied forms of chauvinism ensured
that such communities typically (although not exclusively or
essentially) were often differentiated and/or interconnected by ethnic
or racial identity. Newton's hypothesis, then, [[implied]{.mark} an
[**experimental practice** of]{.mark}]{.underline}
'[[organizing]{.underline}]{.mark} ... Black and \[other\] [oppressed
communities]{.underline}', both along and across communal lines, with an
eye [[towards]{.mark} the **[progressive seizure
of]{.mark}**]{.underline} local **[[political
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[as well as]{.mark} the creation
of independently organized and staffed]{.underline} '**[people's
institutions]{.underline}**' in order to 'meet the needs of the
community until we can all move to change the social conditions that
make it impossible for the people to afford the things they need and
desire' (Hilliard, 2008: 3). The BPP's famous 'service to the people'
programs can thus be read as Newton's own efforts to confirm his
intercommunal hypothesis, with the most forceful evidence arising in the
incredibly potent Rainbow Coalition formed by the Chicago chapter along
with the Puerto Rican Young Lords, the white 'hillbilly' Young Patriots,
and other community-specific vanguard parties.7

While Newton's central theoretical concept has recently begun to attract
the attention of sympathetic scholars (e.g. Narayan, 2019), a critical
assessment of it obviously lies outside the purview of this article; as
does a response to the numerous critiques of the BPP's lapses in
translating intercommunal theory into organizational practice made not
only by scholars both hostile (Pearson, 1996) and sympathetic
(Henderson, 1997), but by some rank and file Panthers, as well (Shakur,
1987). It is worth emphasizing, however, that, despite
[Newton]{.underline}'s own confidence in his hypothesis and bold
predictions regarding the future its embrace might produce, he also
[intentionally and explicitly]{.underline} '[left]{.underline}
\[[his]{.underline} own [political]{.underline}\] [program
**open-ended** so that it could develop and people could identify with
it]{.underline}', as evinced by the fact that [he began
with]{.underline} very **[[local]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[piecemeal]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[**seemingly reformist**
actions]{.underline}]{.mark} that could only be sustained and directed
through community involvement, thereby [[allowing]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[people]{.mark} in distinct communities [to
**challenge**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[alter]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[or **clarify**]{.underline}]{.mark} his theses [[in an **ongoing**
way]{.underline}]{.mark} (Newton and Morrison, 2009: 47).
[Intercommunalism was]{.underline} thus '**[not]{.underline}** offered
to them as [a **conclusion**]{.underline}' [they **must
accept**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} as [a
**theoretical**]{.underline} '[**vehicle** to move]{.underline} them [to
a **higher level**]{.underline}' [of consciousness and
action]{.underline}; one that was to be as informed by the theoretical
vanguard as it was by their communal constituencies, [as they
**mutually** and **continuously revised** their shared theory and
practice]{.underline}. Thus, while he frequently made clear that he did
not like the internally contradictory reality of things, the slow
development of progress, and the need for continual self-criticism of
his ideas in light of their popular reception any better than his
Leftist opponents, Newton argued that we 'have to understand that
[most]{.underline} of the people [are **not ready** for many of the
things we talk about now]{.underline}'; consequently, [even as they
**speculatively theorize**]{.underline} in advance of the people, Newton
-- effectively summarizing his essential lesson for the academic Left --
argues that [the vanguard must]{.underline} strive to [ensure that their
work is **never**]{.underline} '[**too far ahead** of the]{.underline}
masses of [people]{.underline}, too far ahead of their thinking', [so as
not to **alienate** them]{.underline} from what is, of necessity, their
own struggle (Newton et al., 2004: 46).

Conclusion: The Enduring Relevance of Newton's Lessons for the Academic
Left

My aim in this article has primarily been to highlight and justify the
emphasis that Newton's BPP placed on the need for would-be vanguard
intellectuals to be continually and meaningfully responsible, precisely
by being directly responsive, to a concrete and engaged constituency
seeking its own emancipation: an emphasis, I would like to suggest
briefly in closing, that actually aligns Newton with some recent
critiques of the Panthers primarily grounded in the very different
conception of the vanguard embraced by groups often understood to be
furthering their legacy.

Adolph Reed has long argued that the

oppositional tendency in post-segregation black politics was hampered by
its origin in black power ideology. Radicals -- all along the spectrum,
ranging from cultural nationalist to Stalinist Marxist -- began from a
stance that took the 'black community' as the central configuration of
political interest and the source of critical agency ... This
formulation \[presumes\] the existence of a racial population that is
organically integrated and that operates as a collective subject in
pursuit of unitary interests \[and thus treats\] leaders or
spokespersons ... not so much representatives as pure embodiments of
collective aspirations. (Reed, 1999: 134)

Effectively echoing Newton's critiques of both black nationalists and
white socialists for imposing their conceptions of authentic black
interests onto an un-consulted populace -- often grounded in a quite
distinct and essentialist conception of 'community' -- Reed claims that
[[many]{.underline}]{.mark} contemporary radical [thinkers and
activists]{.underline} 'simply [[do not see **political differences**
among black people]{.underline}]{.mark}' [[as]{.underline}]{.mark} being
[[**relevant** to]{.mark} the [analysis]{.mark} of]{.underline}, [[or
struggle against]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[racial
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Reed, 2000: 72). [Guided more by the
**judgment of peers** than by a confrontation with the
**conflicted**]{.underline}, **[messier]{.underline}**, [and **more
pressing concerns** and **interests** expressed by the **actual
consistencies** under discussion]{.underline}, '[the substance
of]{.underline} \[such\] [political [theorizing]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[[[has become]{.underline}]{.mark}\] a hermetic exercise in sketching a
utopian alternative to current social relations' reflective of the
distance theorists enjoy from them; the result, Reed argues, has been
[an **often [hostile]{.mark}** [and
**demobilizing**]{.mark}]{.underline} '[**[debate]{.mark}** **within**
and **between** these tendencies]{.underline}' that '[[centred **more
on**]{.underline}]{.mark} ... [[**internal consistency** than
on]{.underline}]{.mark} apparent [[**fit** with]{.underline}]{.mark} the
facts of [[an **external**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**lived
[world]{.mark}** [or]{.mark}]{.underline} verifiably [[**demonstrable
capacities** for intervening]{.mark} in it]{.underline}' in ways that
either further the interests or increase the political capacity of the
actual and diverse communities meant to be liberated through them (Reed,
1999: 7).

Recent work by Cedric Johnson traces with exacting historical detail how
'the 'two line struggle' between black nationalists and Marxists
descended into parochialism' (Johnson, 2007: 155) as the 1960s passed
into the era of reaction, bolstering Reed's (1999: 136) claim that for
'both camps \[it was\] [[concern with]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[internal consistency]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the global narrative
\[that\] [[drove]{.mark} the elaboration of **[ideological
positions]{.mark}**]{.underline}[']{.mark} regarding a presumed black
community, [ensuring]{.underline} that '[neither]{.underline} Marxists
nor nationalists [offered programs with **demonstrable payoffs**
comparable to those promised by mainstream politicians]{.underline}' to
the communities in whose name both camps claimed to speak.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} tendency, Johnson (2007) claims,
[[led]{.underline}]{.mark} theorists and [[many]{.underline}]{.mark}
activists [**[away]{.mark}** [from]{.mark}]{.underline} the kind of
[responsive social [organizing]{.mark}]{.underline} which I have tried
to show was key to the BPP's theory and praxis, and [into a]{.underline}
'mid-seventies [turn to ideological education]{.underline}' [based on
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} '[detrimental [assumption that **ideological
clarity must precede political work** and that]{.mark}]{.underline}
familiarity with the radical canon' of texts and/or **[[correct
ideas]{.underline}]{.mark}** '[[is a **prerequisite**]{.mark} to
meaningful participation in social life]{.underline}'; and, as Johnson
notes, '[such]{.underline} education
[programs]{.underline} ... tend ... to [[**privilege intellectuals** in
relation to nonelite participants]{.underline}]{.mark}', [[replacing a
**vanguard**]{.mark} answerable to a specific constituency
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} varied forms of [**[brokerage
politics]{.mark}** where]{.underline} (largely
[self-proclaimed]{.underline}) [elite representatives of subaltern
groups speak in their name]{.underline}, [rather than helping to
facilitate]{.underline} the economic and political
**[self-determination]{.underline}** of marginalized communities (p.
163, emphases added).

As '[radical theory]{.underline}' has become increasingly 'disconnected
from positive social action', both Johnson and Reed suggest that
'radical imagery \[[has been]{.underline}\] [[**cut loose** from
**standards of success** or **failure**]{.underline}']{.mark} (Reed,
1999: 141) [that tie it to the world of **concrete
organizing**]{.underline}, leading to a kind of retreat into 'slogans
and anachronistic analogies', or 'potted rhetoric that asserts \[the
activists'\] bona fides, without concern for communicating outside the
ranks of believers' (Reed, 2000: 194--195); that is, the post-1960s
trends in theorizing about economically and socially marginalized
constituencies have effectively removed any material

restraint on those radical tendencies' flight into idealism because
[[claiming]{.underline}]{.mark} \[[[to]{.mark} **know**]{.underline},
**[[speak for]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[or]{.mark} **distantly
[support]{.mark}**]{.underline}\] such [a base **[obviated]{.mark}** two
**[key practical tests]{.mark}** of theories and strategies as
explanations and mechanisms of mobilization]{.underline}: (1) [[whether
they can **persuade a significant number**]{.mark} of actual members of
specific populations targeted for mobilization]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} (2) [[whether they can **guide action
efficaciously**]{.underline}]{.mark}. (Reed, 1999: 17--18)

Conversely, [[because they have become **disconnected** from a **genuine
vanguard**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [long-suffering [communities have
become]{.mark} **increasingly [less engaged]{.mark}** with progressive
politics]{.underline}, [strategic coalitions]{.underline}, [and mass
mobilization]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} **increasingly [resign
themselves]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the limited options for
advancement that remain within [the current alignment]{.underline},
alternately [embracing [**neoliberal** or **Right-populist
solutions**]{.mark}]{.underline} to the enduring problems of racial and
economic inequality. Both Reed and Johnson have thus been sharply
critical of modes of 'contemporary organizing' grounded in 'the notion
of black exceptionalism', or the 'insistence upon the uniqueness of the
black predicament and on the need for race-specific remedies' (Johnson,
2017), and have criticized, for example, the hegemonic role played by
the Black Lives Matter organization on the contemporary Left, for
'assuming a rather simplistic view of black people's ambitions and
interests and drawing a false dividing line between the interests of
black and non-blacks'.

However, despite the obvious resonances between their shared critique of
intellectual vanguards and the one explicated above, because both
theorists hold that this view 'descends from Black Power thinking \[in
that it\] presumes a commonality of interest among blacks and claims
\[elite\] authority to speak on behalf of those interests', both credit
Newton and the BPP with inspiring this transition, rather than -- as we
have seen above -- presciently warning against its omnipresent danger
and deleterious consequences. While Johnson acknowledges that the BPP
'represented a more revolutionary alternative to the more conservative
black ethnic politics' of cultural nationalism, he nevertheless holds
that their 'embrace ... of black exceptionalism abided by \[many of\]
the same logics' that dominate current theorizing and activism
surrounding black liberation; thus, in challenging the hegemonic
discourse of racial exceptionalism, he simultaneously calls for a turn
away from the BPP model of organizing and from a 'nostalgia' for their
era of influence, most vociferously in an article entitled 'The Panthers
Can't Save Us Now' (Johnson, 2017). Reed is even less sympathetic with
Newton's legacy, for he sees the (as we have seen above, quite fraught)
example of 'the Students for a Democratic Society's 1969 proclamation of
the Black Panther party as the "vanguard of the black revolution"' as
reflective of the 'distortion of political judgment into a search for
authenticity, hauntingly like white youth's quest in the 1960s for the
most "authentic" blues'; on the largely white, academic-led Left, he
identifies a longstanding trend towards political 'exoticism' that
eschews concrete political analysis and organizing in favor of 'thin and
simplistic definitions of good guys and bad, "true" leaders and false'
(Reed, 2000: 71--73), with 'approved' black spokespersons featuring
prominently in the former role. It is thus in large measure the white
Left's ongoing embrace of 'Pantherphile exoticism' (p. 71) that grounds
Reed's dismissive view that the BPP 'added \[little more than\] props
and uniforms to make radical politics entirely a show business
proposition' (Reed, 1999: 72). Neither theorist, however, attends to the
strong tensions between the BPP and the purported vanguards of black
culturalist and white socialist resistance of their time; tensions that
ultimately and tragically revealed the dangers inherent in their
divergent, but similarly Manichean, worldviews.

While the BPP faced surveillance, harassment arrests, and other forms of
police brutality from their inception, the first lethal violence they
suffered came in early 1969, when cultural nationalists from the US
organization8 (most likely at the instigation of the FBI, but in direct
response to Newton's harsh criticisms of their political program)
murdered Panther representatives Bunchy Carter and John Huggins during a
conflict over the newly created University of California Black Studies
program, in which US sought to control the program's hires and content,
while the Panthers pushed for involving the local, off-campus community
at all stages of decision-making.9 Shortly thereafter, an SDS splinter
group that called itself the Weather Underground -- once again, over the
strenuous objections of local Panther leadership -- staged the 'Days of
Rage', which mainly consisted of vandalizing lower-middle-class areas of
Chicago in an effort to 'bring the war home'; an action that was
exploited by local police to help secure the warrant that led to the
state assassination of Rainbow Coalition founder Fred Hampton.10 There
could hardly be starker demonstrations of the intrinsic dangers of the
flunkeyism that always arises when one seeks to instruct, rather than
serve the people, or confuses one's own speculative theorizing for their
authentic will.

An assessment of their critique of the contemporary Left obviously lies
beyond the scope of this article; however, if Johnson is correct to
claim not only that 'black ethnic politics has reached its ends or
limits as an effective set of political practices', but, moreover, 'that
the ends or aims of contemporary African American politics must become
radically democratic in form and aspirations' (Johnson, 2007: 218), and
if Reed (1999: 50--51) is correct in arguing that

[encouraging popular participation is the **only effective possibility**
for reinvigorating a **progressive movement** in black political life
because [people respond]{.mark}]{.underline} by organizing themselves
[[when **offered concrete visions**]{.mark} that connect with their
lives as they experience them]{.underline}, **[[not]{.mark} to
[ideological abstractions]{.mark}]{.underline}** or generic agendas that
perfume narrow class programs,

then [the problem is how we move]{.underline} from a political landscape
fragmented by both the rhetoric and reality of racial division [into a
coalition of movements capable of **effecting the transformations
necessary**]{.underline} to overcome such division, as well as the class
repression that requires it; this is, of course, the very problem with
which Newton struggled throughout his active career, and while his
answers remain somewhat speculative, his practical efforts to confirm
them through the BPP's service programs and unique brand of coalition
politics bore undeniable, considerable, and suggestive fruit.
[Revolutionary intercommunalism may]{.underline} thus [be of **great
aid** in theorizing and organizing our way through the current
impasse]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} remains, in my view, a
hypothesis deserving of further testing; but, regardless, I hope to have
shown that Newton and the BPP [should be]{.underline} grasped as
**[essential resources]{.underline}** as we seek [to **close
the**]{.underline} seemingly widening **[gap]{.underline}** between
theory and practice, or more precisely, [between theorists and the
people]{.underline}. At the very least, their history and legacy serve
as stark reminders of the need to continually work to ground our
necessary -- but necessarily speculative -- theorizing in the
understanding that 'dropouts understand things students don't' (Newton
et al., 2004: 85).

### Clash Turns Case---Meliorism---1NC

#### We should debate about the [practical consequences]{.underline} of accepting ontological truths, not just their descriptive validity. Pre-supposing metaphysical truths makes debates about "where do we go from here" [intellectually undecideable]{.underline}.

[There is a **long history of pessimists** in African American thought
that]{.underline} would today, more than ever, [hold]{.underline} that
[we]{.underline} just [need to **give up** on the idea that whites can
be saved]{.underline}. Scholars like Thandeka must then face these
skeptical challenges that use history, sociology, and law to support
their pessimistic stance in regard to where we go from here. [They have
claimed that **all the historical evidence warrants giving up** on
waiting for whites to be reformed]{.underline}. From Frederick Douglass
to Tommy Curry, [there have been pessimistic critics of "the Black
philosopher's **obsessive hope** in the **redemptive character of white
innocence**]{.underline}."11 [The stronger pessimists' challenge argues
that historically, groups in power are **not likely to give up power
easily** and the **lives of black people are at stake**; therefore, we
**cannot wait** until whites have some **affective
transformation**]{.underline} as suggested by Thandeka. [Only some
**political radical action** has a chance of bringing about genuine
change]{.underline}.

Thandeka is by no means alone in the hope that whites can change. In
fact, there is plenty of new and exciting research in support of her
side. In her most recent publication, The Future of Whiteness, Linda
Alcoff argues that [whiteness is **not inextricably tied** to white
supremacy. There are **no fixed social categories** and therefore **no
grounds for fatalism**. There is **hope** that white people will **face
the truths** of who they are and how they got here, and will **push
back** on the seductions of white supremacy]{.underline}.12

[I]{.underline} am not going to pretend to solve this long-standing
debate but [will critique the assumption that **proper appeal to facts**
and **reason** will settle the issue. Often **both sides** think their
side is **empirically grounded** and the other is **ideological**.
Because of the predominance of white supremacy in US history, the
pessimist's side]{.underline} is the one that [**usually feels more
secure** that the facts are on]{.underline} her [\[their\] side.
They]{.underline} thus [portray those with some hope]{.underline}, like
Thandeka, [as **committed to some value-ethical commitments**
that]{.underline} blinds one to [\[**obscures**\] the facts and what
they call for. From the pessimist's standpoint, someone who brings value
considerations is another case of moral rhetoric that ends up **masking
the reality** of exploitation, mass incarceration, poverty, and
militarized police murdering unarmed black men. For them, it is
**obvious** that efforts to save the whites or forgive them are **not
warranted by the evidence**. However]{.underline}, as sympathetic as I
sometimes am to their side, it is clear to me that **[none of the
pessimist's postures]{.underline}** in regard to whites [follow from a
**mere empirical study** of the facts]{.underline} (e.g., history,
sociology). [The notion that the pessimist is the one who is adopting an
objective "valueless" Archimedean standpoint in this debate is
**false**]{.underline}. Any posture or resolution such as revenge,
separation, resistance, or killing presupposes a value standpoint that
goes beyond the facts.

Thandeka and the pessimist may agree about all the historical evidence
against whites and still reasonably disagree about where we go from
here. If evidence alone does not determine the issue, then what reasons
account for the disagreements? Here is my hypothesis: [the issue of
"**Where do we go from here**" is one of those "**intellectually
undecidable**" issues]{.underline} presented by William James in The
Will to Believe. [Even when there is a **preponderance of evidence** on
one side, it **cannot be decided on only empirical-theoretical
grounds**]{.underline}. More importantly, [our **metaphysical** and
**value-affective commitments** play a key role]{.underline}. Let me
explain.

[In a]{.underline} discussion-[**debate about where we go from here**,
we must **lay out all the facts** or **evidence** that supports our
belief, but we **rarely lay out all the operative background
assumptions** or "**put all the cards on the table**."]{.underline} For
instance, both sides may appeal to historical evidence, but history is
after all just that, history. [The issue is about **what should be done
today**, **where we should put our hopes**, or **what we should try
now**]{.underline}. For instance, at this point in history, should we
trust "white" people? ["Hope" and "trust" **presuppose risk**, and the
issue of whether something is worth the risk or not is **not totally
decided** by adopting some **theoretically detached "objective" study**
of the facts or history]{.underline}. In disagreements about this sort
of issue or belief, there is a lot going on in the background that has
nothing to do with the empirical evidence or "facts."

The Role of Metaphysical13 Assumptions in "Where Do We Go from Here?"

The issue of where we go from here cannot be addressed without
assumptions about the reality of the temporal or history. [In deciding
where we go, one must **presuppose a view** about the "here" (the
present) and how in general it relates to the past and the
future]{.underline}. Let me return to debates among black intellectuals
to illustrate the profound difference one's metaphysical beliefs about
history make, and in particular black history, in figuring out where we
go from here.

[A good place to start is]{.underline} a statement by James
**[Baldwin]{.underline}** that has received much attention since the
release of the film I Am Not Your Negro: ["History is **not the past**.
History is the **present**. We **carry our history with us**. To think
otherwise is criminal."]{.underline}14 [Baldwin is raising a criticism
of a certain view of history, one in which the **past atrocities
suffered by blacks can be forgotten** because in reality they do not
exist anymore]{.underline}. White ignorance or amnesia may be
self-serving and have different causes, but Baldwin is correcting a
metaphysical assumption about the past and history here. [However,
Baldwin's assertion is **ambiguous** or can be subjected to **different
views of history**]{.underline}. In a recent article in Slate, 15 Ismail
[Muhammad]{.underline} notices this ambiguity and [argues that we have
misunderstood the importance]{.underline} of James Baldwin for today's
black writers. The statement that "we carry history with us" can be
interpreted in different ways depending on our views of the past and
history (our metaphysics of time).

[What is the alternative to the sort of presentism where the past just
**drops from existence** as we move forward in time?]{.underline} What
does "we carry our history with us" mean, and what weight does this have
for blacks in deciding where we go from here? [Muhammad is **critical**
of interpretations of Baldwin and black history that assume that
"\[b\]lack people are **merely living through endless repetitions of
slavery** and **Jim Crow**, which white supremacists massaged into
**subtler forms of control**. According to this thesis, black Americans
exist in a moment of **foundational violence**---**slavery**---that
**repeats ad infinitum**."]{.underline}16 Hence, [distinct historical
moments can be **collapsed into one**]{.underline}; Jesmyn Ward, among
other African American intellectuals, sees "Trayvon Martin's death as
the latest episode of a recurrent nightmare. [Replace ropes with
bullets]{.underline}. . . . [Nothing is new]{.underline}. . . .
[**\[E\]very aspect of contemporary life** has a corollary in the Jim
Crow past]{.underline}. . . . [White supremacy might have swapped
guises, but its power **remains interminable** and
**total**]{.underline}."17 [This take on black history **cannot help but
result in the more pessimistic answers** to "Where do we go from here?,"
but]{.underline} for Muhammad, [this is **not Baldwin**]{.underline}. On
the contrary, Baldwin should be used today to challenge this "logic of
perpetual trauma."18 [It is true that "we carry history with us" implies
"history's inescapable purchase upon black life," but "history is **not
immutable**]{.underline}; . . . [it is a practice we **always conduct in
the present tense**, **reshaping the past** in order to **imagine
desired futures**]{.underline}."19 [This]{.underline} way of
understanding black history [**acknowledges that black history has been
traumatic**, but also acknowledges "the long shadows that slavery and
Jim Crow cast on our present **without standing in
them**."]{.underline}20 According to this metaphysics or history,
[racist violence **persists**, regularity **exists**, but it is **not
cyclical**. There are **no historical necessities** and **immutable
truths**. White supremacy continues to generate anxiety, fear, and
anger]{.underline} (i.e., [it **persists**]{.underline}), [but it
**makes little sense** to claim it is **perpetual** or has **such a
grip** that there are **no felt possibilities beyond it**]{.underline}.

Muhammad is pointing to important assumptions that have received little
attention in discussions about white supremacy. Scholars like Charles W.
Mills have alerted us about not being blind to the legacy of white
supremacy in our present society.21 The way he understands the phrase
"We carry our history with us" presupposes a historical perspective in
which the injustices of today are part of a larger historical narrative
about the development of modern societies that goes back to how
Europeans have progressively dehumanized or subordinated others. There
is nothing problematic about this historical perspective, but is it one
that is adopted in the present (as the locus of reality) or from an
Archimedean or God's-eye view of history (in which the past and the
present can be gazed upon)? Muhammad interprets Baldwin as assuming the
former; when Baldwin says "History is the present" and "We carry our
history with us," he means that [to be in history is to be in a
**present** and **open situation** that is **continuous with previous
ones** and where structures that have persisted **weigh heavily** in our
present memories, bodies, habits, and communities. We can say
that]{.underline} the [reality]{.underline} of exploitation, mass
incarceration, poverty, and militarized police murdering unarmed black
men [is continuous with previous forms of, or is the legacy of, "white
supremacy," but there is **really no white supremacy as a single** and
**fixed evil across history**]{.underline}. This is basic to
understanding why there is some hope in Baldwin.

Whether Muhammad is correct about Baldwin is secondary to my main point:
the role of metaphysical assumptions in debates about where we go from
here. Pessimists and optimists have these assumptions, and making them
explicit in debates may advance communal inquiry more than pretending
that the issue can be decided by being "empirical" and objective about
black history. Many blacks would agree that "history is the present" and
"we carry our history with us," but exactly how the horrendous past of
whites bears on the present depends in part on the extent to which we
believe that what anchors all historical accounts of the past is the
present, or if we see the present as just the effect of the past. How
open-endedly we conceive the universe bears on having some hope. The
Role of Affective-Value Reasons in "Where Do We Go from Here?" There is
no sense in denying that personal-idiosyncratic reasons may play a role
in deciding where to take a stand on where we go from here, whether we
are aware of them or not. What I have in mind are personal experiences
or the possible slant or bias as a result of being a member of some
social group (class, gender, etc.). However, here, I wish to highlight
the role of the affectivevalue dimension in the sense that is emphasized
by Thandeka. The fact is that a value slant seems unavoidable since
people come from different moral sensitivities and value commitments.
James calls some of these hidden reasons "the passional." This is
important in understanding disagreements among thinkers in the black
intellectual tradition. The disagreement between Martin Luther King,
Jr., and Malcolm X cannot be understood unless we consider, for example,
the religious-moral background and values that informed each side.
Thandeka shares the same Christian value-laden slant of Martin Luther
King, Jr., when she proposes to "save" whites. There is nothing
inherently problematic about this value commitment, but it needs to be
made explicit. Again, not even the most rigorous empirical-scientific
pessimist can avoid taking a value standpoint on where we go from here.
I can easily imagine someone being in total agreement with Thandeka's
diagnosis of whites in America and still disagree that whites are
capable of being saved or that we should try to do something about it.
How Should We Approach "Where Do We Go from Here?": A Proposal

If I am correct, does it mean that discussion on this issue is a waste
of time since at the end of the day, it is undecidable, and all a matter
of people's subjectivevalue commitments?22 Does it mean there is just no
way to determine better from worse positions in regard to where we go
from here? Not at all. [**Not all views are equally supported** or
**reasonable**]{.underline}. Moreover, [the lesson]{.underline} of James
[in regard to genuine options that are "intellectually undecidable" is
**not to stop serious inquiry** about facts and history or the appeal to
them as the basis for justification from our stance]{.underline}.23 [We
should continue to aim at engaging in an **open** and **inclusive
communal inquiry**]{.underline} about this issue, [but ideally all
parties must **make an honest effort to put all the cards on the table**
in the discussion. The acknowledgment that there are "affective"
commitments that **guide our most factual-empirical inquiries** is an
important step; the alternative is a repression that does not
work]{.underline}.

This last proposal is not easy. [Our intellectual arrogance often **gets
in the way**, and even under ideal conditions, most of us are **not even
aware of our deepest affective-value reasons** that guide our
inquiries]{.underline}. In other words, [we **resist** or are
**incapable** of putting all the cards on the table. However, this is
**not a good reason to not try**, and it points to the importance of
trying to have the **most inclusive community of inquiry**. Finding out
what "our cards" are is **not a matter of self-introspection** of our
beliefs or in our minds; it is a matter of **social interaction**, of
**being confronted by others**. The **best way to find out our slant**,
**bias**]{.underline}, and blindness [is via **communication**,
**especially with those we disagree with**. There is **no Archimedean
standpoint that we can appeal to** in deciding **who is right in the
disagreements** about where we go from here. The lack of such a
standpoint **should not be a source of despair**. There are **better**
and **worse understandings** of others and the possibility of learning
from them]{.underline}.

More importantly, especially in regard to issues such as where we go
from here, all the options on the table have their own risk; [there is
**no certainty** or **way of really knowing beforehand** which is
correct. This requires a lot of **epistemic humility**. All parties
should be **fully committed** to taking a stand, but should be **aware
of their fallibility**]{.underline}. This demands adopting an
experimental attitude that is nowhere to be found today in public
discourse. The source of this proposal is the shared insights of the
American melioristic democratic philosophical tradition---James, Du
Bois, Baldwin, Addams, Dewey, Locke. There are important differences
between these thinkers, and they do not share a particular answer to the
question "Where do we go from here?" that we can recover for today. In
fact, if there is one, it is that different times (and contexts) call
for us to revisit the question in light of all of the best present
intellectual resources we can muster. [An intelligent stance requires a
**serious inquiry** into the diagnosis about the **proper means relative
to the present context**. **Even if we come to agree** that a
**revolution is called for today**, there is still the issue of **what
particular sort of revolution** and **what means are
needed**]{.underline}. To be sure, some of these thinkers defended prima
facie reasons for preferring democratic means, but in principle, they
are open to any particular means, even killing. [I would not be honest
or be putting all the cards on the table if I did not disclose the
common metaphysical beliefs and the **melioristic affective backbone**
that animate this tradition]{.underline}. This is consistent with my
previous analysis on what is operative in the background of "Where do we
go from here?" Let me elaborate.

In regard to "Where do we go from here?," [this philosophical tradition
**resists** or **is critical of** both the **optimism** of white denial
and the **pessimism** of black despair. Insofar as both assume we live
in a "**block universe**," there is **no basis for such determinism in
reality**]{.underline}. This philosophical tradition assumes an open
nature of a pluralistic cosmos, and this makes a difference in how
American philosophers think about and confront evils-injustices as
events in life as a present process. For them, [the **comfort** from the
certainty of both optimism and pessimism seem **shallow** and usually
lead to **total passivity** in the form of either waiting for the
unavoidable progress to come or **pessimistic resignation**,
**despair**, and **cynism**. Injustices are usually events with a
history, but in an **open** and **unfinished horizon** of a world
**still in the making**; therefore, where we have been **does not
determine where we should go**.]{.underline} More importantly, [even our
best-grounded optimistic or pessimistic stances are **likely to be
mistaken** and **corrected by unexpected events**]{.underline}.

The second "metaphysical" background belief or reason that guides this
philosophical tradition in answering "where do we go from here?" is that
according to their view of reality as lived experience, the stable and
the precarious are inseparable aspects.24 [This warrants]{.underline} an
initial [**skepticism** about any story]{.underline} about events,
people, or about entire countries (like the United States) [that
**overaccentuate** or **eliminate** one element over the
other]{.underline}. In other words, [both a **wholesale idealistic
optimism** and a **realistic pessimism** about the past and the present
have **no basis in reality**]{.underline}. They are both forms of
"blindness" if their position is a result of denying either the stable
or the precarious, or the good and the bad of existence. [This is **not
to deny** that sometimes evil and precariousness can so
pronounced]{.underline} (in comparison to stability, good things, and
possibilities) [as to make one's existence **unbearable**]{.underline}.

While the above metaphysical beliefs are important to understanding the
particular stance of this particular American philosophical tradition,
it is not sufficient to appreciate where they stand in regard to "Where
do we go from here?" What needs to be made explicit is its meliorism.
James and Dewey tried to define meliorism. James writes: "[Meliorism
treats salvation as neither **inevitable** nor **impossible**. It treats
it as a **possibility**, which becomes **more** and **more of a
probability the more numerous the actual conditions of salvation
become**]{.underline}."25 However, most definitions have fallen short in
describing how meliorism operates. [It is neither an **idea** nor a
**theory**]{.underline}; [instead]{.underline}, it has been described as
[an **orientation**, a **posture** or a **faith** toward the self and
the world]{.underline}. This seems correct, but I think [it is also an
**affective orientation** toward evil]{.underline}. It is a unique and
strange form of sensibility from the point of view of those who do not
have it, since it combines what seems to be contradictory or in tension.
[Melioristic people want to **better the world even if it is a matter of
degree** and even if at the end of the day, there is **no final
salvation** and **tragedy is unavoidable**]{.underline}. For them, [evil
must not be forgotten even if it is no longer suffered. Tragic
sensibility is **not incompatible** with present possibilities and
ideals]{.underline}.

In the context of the United States, [this tradition is an
**alternative** to the optimistic]{.underline} blindness [\[ignorance\]
that still operates]{.underline} in regard to the greatness of its past,
about living in a democracy, or about the lives of the oppressed. In
Damn Great Empires: William James and the Politics of Pragmatism,
Alexander Livingston recently argued that in the American philosophical
tradition (James, Du Bois, Baldwin, Addams, Dewey, Locke), we find a
"meliorism that bears witness to the difference between the ideal and
the real" and "may itself be the greatest defense against the deceptive
craving for the false and moralistic history of American hope that holds
us captive."26 I agree with Livingston that the best way to understand
and reconstruct this tradition today is by appreciating how each of
these thinkers has contributed something different to the melioristic
philosophy. There are important differences among these thinkers; for
instance, some had a more acute tragic sensibility and others were more
perceptive about the importance of ideals, but they are all meliorists.

Du Bois is very important in revealing the particular optimistic
blindness that has historically been the most common problem in the
United States with its exceptionalist narrative myth of the nation's
perpetual progress and the amnesia concerning the nation's past.27
However, Du Bois, at least in his early works, can also be read as
calling for a hope that embraces the history and unavoidable elements of
suffering, disappointment, and uncertainty--- grief without denial. [We
must be **critical** of narratives about **perpetual** and **linear
progress** in race relations]{.underline}, and not be blind about the
darker realities behind our rhetoric of freedom and equality. [However,
we must also not be]{.underline} blind [\[ignorant\] about **present
unique possibilities of amelioration** and **must avoid presupposing
essentialist** or **fixed meaning** to "whiteness."]{.underline}

In sum, [if the issue]{.underline} "Where do we go from here?" [depends
on taking a stand on "Can white souls be saved?," then the melioristic
tradition would take their "salvation as neither **inevitable** nor
**impossible**. It treats it as a **possibility**, which becomes
**more** and **more of a probability the more numerous the actual
conditions of salvation become**." This sounds]{.underline} to me [like
an **affective impulse to get to work** and try to **inquire into the
conditions** that would improve the souls of whites and, in the process,
those of blacks]{.underline}. Meliorism is an affective stance that
embraces evil and contingency in an open and pluralistic universe. It is
a strange combination of courage and humility. For some, it is too
demanding; for others, it is not enough. If I am correct and understand
Thandeka's project, it is consonant with this philosophical tradition.

### AT: Testing=Antiblack

#### They put the cart before the horse---even if testing is implicated in antiblackness, that doesn't imply throwing it out

**Randolph, et al, 18**---Department of Behavioral Sciences,
Winston-Salem State University (Antonia, with Victor Erik Ray, Megan
Underhill, and David Luke, "Response to Weddington: More Lessons from
Afro-Pessimism," Sociology of Race and Ethnicity, November 1, 2018, dml)
\[inserted the word "to" for grammatical integrity---insertion denoted
by brackets\]

Perhaps most perplexing, Weddington seems to at once abandon the
empirical project of sociology and simultaneously claim an empirical
mantle. [Paraphrasing **Wilderson**]{.underline} (2010), Weddington
(2018) argues that

[a reliance on "**facts**" places a **false burden** on the project of
Afro-pessimism, such that the **reliance on empirical analysis** of
black populations exists to inaugurate an ongoing but ultimately futile
industry of **applying faulty theories** and **concepts** to populations
of black slaves]{.underline}. (p. 6)

[To our knowledge, however, **the only way to decide if a theory is
faulty is to test it**. It is a basic assumption of social science that
**theories are incomplete** and we are attempting \[to\] **refine**,
through **repeated testing**, **better theories** that explain more
about social life]{.underline}. Indeed, [our tools are **imperfect** and
**sometimes implicated** in constructing the very racial structures we
**hope to turn them against**]{.underline} (Zuberi and Bonilla-Silva
2008). [The answer to these problems is **not the rejection**, **a
priori**, of the **possibility of testing**. Rather, we should **search
for better tools**]{.underline}. Sociology as [a knowledge project
**loses tremendously** if we **refuse to examine the empirical status**
of theoretical ideas]{.underline}.

### AT: Info Dissuasion

#### Debate is [effective]{.underline} at discerning contingent truths---their framework is the style of argumentation that [enables post-truth]{.underline} by [mooting the burden of rejoinder]{.underline}---voting against them has [unique value]{.underline} as a form of [deontic scorekeeping]{.underline} that [bolsters collective faith]{.underline} in debate's process. 

**Quirk, 17**---The New School, Information Technology Manager (Michael,
"The Resuscitation of Truth,"
<http://www.publicseminar.org/2017/05/the-resuscitation-of-truth/#.WWK-7xMrK8U>,
dml)

Being indignant about a "post-truth" world is entirely justifiable. But
[I am **not sure** that grumbling about a widely distributed oblivion
toward the true, the factual, and the objective **accomplishes
anything** other than **frustration** and **anxiety**. Railing about
facts **rarely convinces anyone** predisposed toward ignoring
them]{.underline}, and this is not exactly news. As Upton Sinclair put
it: "it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his
salary depends on his not understanding it." What goes for salaries goes
double for worldviews and triple for satisfying pipedreams.

[While there may seem to be something quixotic about persuading the
stubborn, it is **timid to avoid that task**, however fruitless it might
turn out to be]{.underline}. Maybe, as the philosopher Alasdair
MacIntyre once quipped, the only thing that works with persistent
skeptics or relativists is to tell them "go away." But that reply is
understandable only as a last resort, because I think [a **solid**,
**pragmatic case** can be made that **objectivity**, **fact**, and
**truth** are **live**, **forced**, and **momentous options** that can
be **given a successful defense**. Because the defense is **pragmatic**,
rather than **theoretical**, it is an argument that **works** because it
can be **defended on the same grounds as the nihilist's**, even if they
are armed with "alternative facts" tailored to their
worldview]{.underline}. Thus [if this defense fails to persuade them, it
is **no fault of yours**]{.underline}. Rather, [skeptics, relativists,
and nihilists **don't** and **can't really believe** what they say they
believe, because what they do **puts the lie to it**. They fail to
practice what they preach, and they cannot but fail given the
constraints of human discursive conduct.]{.underline}

Pragmatists are often caricatured as being indifferent toward
objectivity and relativistic about truth, but unlike their postmodernist
cousins they are supposedly "cheerful nihilists." Most pragmatists are
widely thought to affirm Richard Rorty's offhand (and incautious)
remarks like "truth is what our peers will let us get away with saying",
or that we would do well to "reduce objectivity to solidarity." Rorty
seemed at times to place everything in the hands of the local, cultural
beliefs of a given epistemic community, which is the first and final
court of appeal for what counts as "fact." If this is what Rorty
believes (I think there is ample textual evidence that it is not) then
all facts are "alternative facts," indexed to the actual assertions of a
given community. It is therefore inevitable that Trump's base and his
fiercest critics will simply talk past each other. Persuasion implies
enough common ground to agree on certain key premises of argument, and
since this is precisely what is lacking, quibbling about truth and
objectivity is pointless. Does this torpedo any conception of truth and
objectivity that is not, in Swain's words, "rhetorical or rooted in
perspective"?

Robert Brandom, is a Professor of Philosophy at the University of
Pittsburgh, and was a student of Rorty's at Princeton. He shares Rorty's
antifoundationalism and also self-identifies as a pragmatist.
Nevertheless, he believes that Rorty's views do not support the sort of
"post-truth" philosophy he is often accused of having, and which he
unwittingly supports when he tries to shock rather than patiently
construct persuasive arguments. Brandom's philosophical project, in his
magnum opus Making It Explicit and other works, can be seen as an
attempt to knock off the rough edges of Rorty's pragmatism and to
refashion it as a systematic philosophy of language that makes sense of
truth and objectivity, and not just an "edifying" philosophy that
provides groundless epistemic hope without "metaphysical comfort." Any
post-truth regime would be over before it starts.

Making It Explicit contains over 700 pages of dense, complex prose
written in an intensely technical analytic style. (If you can imagine
the late modal logician David Lewis rewriting Rorty's Philosophy and the
Mirror of Nature, you might have some idea of how Making It Explicit
reads.) But there are two strands that can be teased out of Brandom's
reflections on language that are directly relevant to contemporary
Trumpian politics and its oblivion of truth and objectivity.

First, [Brandom follows]{.underline} C.S. Peirce and Donald Davidson [in
drawing a **sharp distinction** between truth and justification. This
distinction is rooted in our practices of **making claims**, **defending
them with reasons**, and **withdrawing those claims** when evidence or
argument shows them to be baseless]{.underline}. To use the most common
example: I would be justified, if I were an 11th century cloistered
monk, in believing that the earth was at the center of the universe. I
could cite many reasons for this belief that could support this belief
and command assent: the best available astronomical science of the day,
scriptural testimony, and the ordinary experience of watching the sun,
stars, and planets rise in the east and set in the west. The belief is
held to be true, and the monk is justified in believing it true, but as
a matter of fact, it is false. [The relationship between justification
and truth is a complicated and important one, but neither concept can be
reduced to the other. I could be justified in believing X which turns
out not to be true, and for that matter I can believe Y, which is true,
without being justified in believing it --- my facts could be wrong, my
reasoning could be off]{.underline}. What [Brandom is drawing our
attention to]{.underline} is [the **sound linguistic practice** involved
in the **giving** and **assessing of reasons**. What we call "rational
discourse" will involve **weighing** and **evaluating** our own reasons
and that of others, **responding to challenges** and **revising** or
even **dropping our own convictions**]{.underline}. [There is **no foggy
metaphysical speculation** or **transcendental deduction** behind
Brandom's truth/justification distinction. It is **simply an unavoidable
part** of human sapience as expressed in our discursive
practices.]{.underline}

Second, sapient human [discourse **invariably involves norms**, elements
of discursive practice that **distinguish valid from invalid "moves"**,
and that enable participants in the practice to both **track** and
**evaluate** those moves as **better** or **worse**. "Moves" in
discursive practices are usually inferences: I draw conclusions from
premises to which I am committed, and therefore are committed to the
conclusions as well; I track the claims and inferences of other
participants in the dialogue, and gauge whether (or to what extent) they
too are **entitled to their own commitments**]{.underline}. So [rational
discourse centers around the inferences we draw, inferences that emerge
from]{.underline} the sapient social practice of [making claims and
engaging in]{.underline} what Brandom calls "**[deontic
scorekeeping]{.underline}**", [employing **shared practical norms** to
**assess entitlements** and **commitments** of fellow participants, and
ourselves.]{.underline}

[Meaningful human discourse,]{.underline} then, [is a) **constrained by
shared norms** that b) guide inferences articulating one's commitments
that c) one may or may not be entitled to hold.]{.underline} Our
judgment of how well we, and our conversation partners, avoid error or
get things right is what Brandom calls a "normative status" --- a
judgment that someone is entitled to believe or assert something. Those
beliefs to which one is committed one takes to be true (what sense does
it make to say "I believe X but it's false"?), but I am entitled to
those beliefs only to the extent that I can justify them. [In discursive
practices, we hold ourselves and others responsible for the commitments
we hold by **determining whether we are entitled to them**, whether the
inferential moves made in the linguistic social practice **pass muster
with the norms** that make the social practice what it is]{.underline}.

There is, of course, something going on in discourse besides inference:
there are also what Brandom dubs "discursive entry" and "discursive
departure" moves. We are causally affected by non-linguistic beings,
which cause not just sensations but perceptions, which give
non-inferential access to the world but are possible only for sapient
beings that are capable of drawing inferences from them and engaging in
deontic scorekeeping. "Discursive entry/departure" moves anchor us to a
world external to language, but it is the normative activity of holding
ourselves responsible to the inferences drawn from these moves that
constitutes "objectivity."

Brandom was deeply influenced by many other philosophers in developing
this "social practice" conception of objectivity: Wittgenstein's
"meaning-as-use" trope, Heidegger's notion of Dasein as
"Being-in-the-world," Sellars's rejection of "the Myth of the Given" and
his epistemology of "the logical space of reasons." Brandom leverages
this account of the primacy of social practice into a comprehensive
theory of meaning, where pragmatic ideas like "inference", "commitment"
and "entitlement" are primary, and semantic notions like "truth" and
"reference" are derived from them, rather than the other way around,
where meaning depends on a general theory of representation. For
Brandom, we do not start out with a distinction between "subjectivity"
and "objectivity" and then proceed to show how the objective world is
correctly (and incorrectly) represented in subjective knowers, a path
that has generated all manner of aporiae since Descartes and Locke.
Rather, we establish the ebb and flow of human, sapient social
practices, of assertion and reason-giving, and articulate "objectivity",
"fact", and "truth" from there.

This is obviously just a thumbnail sketch of a few main ideas in Making
It Explicit. It is a book of many virtues: clarity and ease of
expression is not one of them, however. Brandom is a philosopher's
philosopher: his work is crammed with philosophical "shop talk", and it
is difficult to show how this might be relevant to what another
pragmatist, John Dewey, called "the problems of men" \[sic\] that
philosophy must address if it is to remain a worthwhile endeavor. But I
do not think the connection between Brandom's musings and constructing
an escape-route past "post-truth politics" is farfetched, and I do think
there are several political lessons to be teased out of Brandom's
"inferentialism." [One of Brandom's obsessive points]{.underline} about
inference [is the **inescapable normativity** of human discourse, and
that such norms, like "holding oneself and others responsible for
commitments made" are **built-into discourse** and **shared in
common**]{.underline}. Put in the vernacular: [if you want to **talk
politics** and **make sense**, you have to **recognize** and **honor
these shared norms**. **You can't just do or say whatever you want**.
**You can't just make shit up**]{.underline}.

[The first political lesson to learn is: **don't let them gaslight
you**]{.underline}. By "them" I mean Trump and his base, their
right-wing media enablers, and those critics like Barton Swain who give
the former far too much credit for ushering in a supposedly postmodern
"post-truth" regime. [This is **no time** to **get all wobbly** about
"**truth**", "**fact**", and "**objectivity**." They are **still
meaningful**, because discourse **does not get off the ground without
them**. The post-truth regime is a **mirage**. **The emperor has no
clothes**, so **do not give him more power** by **fearing** that the
concept of truth has **lost its resonance**.]{.underline}

The second lesson is to [view objectivity **not as something given**, as
**something obvious**, but as something one **must achieve in social
practices** that involve the **giving** and **taking of
reasons**]{.underline}. One of the many shortcomings of Hillary
Clinton's hapless campaign was her assumption that facts speak for
themselves and that truth follows on their heels. This would be fine if
this were a campaign like any other, where everybody is on the same page
when it comes to holding both others in the dialogue and oneself
responsible for commitments by appealing to shared norms. There has to
be an attunement to the context of discussion. No attunement, no
background norms, and no compelling appeals to facts. Dropping facts as
if they were truth-bombs will not work if your adversaries are unwilling
to recognize their force. Decontextualized facts convince no one,
certainly not anyone spoon-fed by Fox and Breitbart and the right-wing
echo chamber. Little truths are no match for "the big lie".

Third, [what needs to be cultivated is not appeal to "the obvious", but
the disposition to **take normative scorekeeping seriously** --- to
**hold every foot to the fire** of showing one is entitled to the
beliefs one claims to be true --- and to **make this manifest** to
others who might have lost their way]{.underline}. I think this is the
most important lesson to be learned from Brandom's magnum opus: that
[ultimately discourse is **guided by a kind of ethical constraint**, the
need for both **inferential consistency** and **inferential relevance**,
and a sort of **guilt** or **shame** when one **deliberately fails to
honor that constraint**]{.underline}.

So when Trump claims that he would have won the vote had there not been
"millions of cases of voter fraud" in California, he needs to be able to
back that commitment up in order to be entitled to it, and not just any
reason will suffice given the nature of the norms guiding that kind of
public discourse. [Appealing to "alternative facts"]{.underline} as if
they were givens, or insinuating "Lots of people said they witnessed
voter fraud," without saying who or citing sources, [**don't cut the
mustard**, not so much because they "fly in the face of the facts" as
that they **betray a mammoth irresponsibility** toward the
**norm-governed practice** of **justifying whatever one claims to be
true** in a manner consistent with **shared standards** of **evidence**
and **inference**. There is something **worthy of guilt** and **shame**
to **fail to follow these norms**]{.underline}. If Trump has no shame,
which I think clearly is the case, one cannot assume that everyone in
his base lacks it as well.

It is thus wrong and counterproductive to accuse avid Trump supporters
of stupidity. Partly because "Trump supporters" are a heterogeneous lot,
and no one should assume that they all have the same axe to grind or the
same sociopolitical agenda, and therefore can be dismissed in the manner
of, say, a Bill Maher as a collection of Yahoos. But stupidity is not
what is at stake here. A kind of irresponsibility is, though. For [to
talk of "alternative facts,"]{.underline} as Kellyanne Conway did, [or
to **unthinkingly accept them as gospel**, without acknowledging the
social requirement of **putting up good public reasons** or **shutting
up**, is to admit that either one **does not mean what one says**, or
**does not care** one way or the other. It is **not** to play the game
of political discourse by **different rules**. It is to **refuse to play
it at all**]{.underline}. Some Trumpians fall into that category, I
think. And [that is a kind of **ethical failure**.]{.underline}

### AT: "Reasonability"

#### Their model of reasonability is [untenable]{.underline}---it amounts to "our interps are reasonable if we say so," which makes the topic an [unlimited free-for-all]{.underline} and solves [neither side's offense]{.underline}. Competing interpretations is the best guide to [making a fair decision]{.underline} with incomplete information.

**Hansen, 18**---Senior Associate Professor, Danish School of Media and
Journalism (Ejvind, "Aporias of courage and the freedom of expression,"
Philosophy & Social Criticism, Vol 44, Issue 1, 2018, dml) \[language
modifications denoted by brackets\]

In order for a practice to be courageous [there needs to be some kind of
**goal**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, furthermore, [some kind of
**connection** between the **goal** and the **practice**]{.underline}.
This is admittedly still pretty vague. [Insofar as we
**define**]{.underline} courage as [a]{.underline} challenging
[practice]{.underline} in which we risk our lives in order [to
**reasonably further** some kind of goal]{.underline}, [we have reached
a **definition** with elements]{.underline} ('risk', 'lives',
'reasonably' 'further', 'some kind of goal') [that are very open to
**differing views**]{.underline}.

On the one hand, this is certainly as it has to be. If we are to
articulate a positive supplement to the negative definitions of the
freedom of expression, it must be very open, because it should be open
to the improvisational and disruptive impulses of courage. As soon as we
start to define the goals and the ways of reaching them too strictly,
these very definitions might themselves become objects of challenge
through the aporias of courage.

On the other hand, [even though the]{.underline} positive [freedom we
are seeking to instantiate is open to differing views]{.underline},
[this **does not mean** that we might as well **do without
it**]{.underline} -- especially not [when we are talking about
communicative expressions]{.underline}. It draws on the intuition that
life at the outset is the prime value, and if you risk your life [you
are]{.underline} thus [**expected** to be able to say something about
**why** this]{.underline} sacrifice [is necessary]{.underline}. [The
agent]{.underline} who risks her or his life **[always has the burden of
proof]{.underline}**.

Certainly, what is taken to be necessary may vary almost endlessly. That
cannot be determined in advance, once and for all. But an agent who
risks her or his life [without being able to give some account of
**why**]{.underline}, is foolhardy -- and [the chances that]{.underline}
she or he \[[they]{.underline}\] in some sense [will be **taken
seriously** is **minimal**]{.underline}.

With this last move, we are, as premised above, closing in on a
deliberative approach (as articulated in Cohen, 1989, 1997; Habermas,
1981, 1992, 1996; Rawls, 1999\[1971\]), something that may seem
surprising given the French inspiration of the previous sections.
Knowing Habermas' hostility towards the anti-rational impulses in these
positions (Habermas, 1985) on the one hand, and Derrida's hesitation on
linguistic generality (cf. the previous sections) on the other hand,
this calls for some comments.

We are not going to claim that the Habermasian and Derridean approaches
could be reconciled. In previous writings we have, however, argued that
Habermas' deliberative approach and the world-disclosing approaches (in
this article: Foucault and Derrida) articulate two different (and to
some extent opposing) impulses in our social, political and
communicative practices: the impulses of systematicity (attempting to
bring together seemingly disparate phenomena) and the quest for adequacy
(attempting to understand phenomena in their entire diversity) (e.g. in
Hansen, 2005a, 2005b, 2013).

As shown above, Derrida's deconstructive approach can certainly be seen
as an attempt to reveal [the necessary **gaps** and **aporias** embodied
in]{.underline} the generalizing aspects in [argumentative
deliberation]{.underline}. At the same time, however, the findings of
his analyses [do **not** lead to a **refusal** of]{.underline} the
[generalizing approaches as such]{.underline}:

[The undecidable is not merely the]{.underline} oscillation or the
[tension between two decisions]{.underline}; [it is the
experience]{.underline} of that which, though heterogeneous, foreign to
the order of the calculable and the rule, is still obliged -- it is [of
**obligation**]{.underline} that we must speak -- [to
**give**]{.underline} itself up to **[the impossible
decision]{.underline}**, [while **taking account of law** and
**rules**]{.underline}. (Derrida, 1994: 539; emphases added)

Even though Derrida in the above quote is reflecting upon the
undecidable and the moment of freedom he still acknowledges that [the
resulting decision **needs to take account** of laws and
rules]{.underline}. Derrida is very clear that true [decisions are **not
determined** by existing rules and laws]{.underline}, [but **at the same
time**]{.underline}, however, [neither are they **entirely
independent**]{.underline} of rules and laws.

Habermas and Derrida certainly disagree in their analyses of how rules
and laws are (should be) established -- Derrida focusing on emergence
through continuous challenges, Habermas focusing on the deliberative and
argumentative trying to overcome mutual disagreements. Habermas' account
has its limits when it comes to articulating reasonable resentments
towards existing discursive structures (this is an often raised
criticism of Habermas' approach -- see, for example, in Thomassen,
2007), Derrida's approach is lacking in reflections on the forces or
mechanisms that bring back new accounts of the general: how and why do
new rules, laws and accounts of courage come about?

Both positions are (if not in their full articulations then at least in
their founding intuitions) in fact right. [In order]{.underline} for
deconstruction [not to become **merely destructive**]{.underline}, [we
need to understand how reason in communication plays the role of helping
agents to **reach reasonably** towards each other]{.underline}.
[Otherwise public discussions will tend to **dissolve** into an
**infinite ocean of unconnected conversations**]{.underline}; [**any
point of view** will appear as **equally valid**]{.underline}; [**any
decision** will be prevented by the **persistent possibility of raising
counter-voices** by minority groups]{.underline}. [Deliberation is the
responsibility of trying to **reach common understandings** in spite of
initial disagreements]{.underline}. This is where Habermas is right. On
the other hand, in order for such reasonable accounts not to freeze into
dogma, we need (courageous) [**challenges** of the very accounts of
**reasonability**]{.underline}. This is where world-disclosing
approaches as suggested by Foucault and Derrida are at their strongest.

However, having seen that every human practice is embedded in aporetic
paradoxes, it should not come as a surprise that even reason is
aporetically structured: seeking deliberative consensus is a legitimate
aim only insofar as the exchanged arguments seek to include courageous
challenges (possible disturbances of consensus) of the discursive
horizons, just as we have seen that notions of courage [make sense
**only** through]{.underline} some [**deliberative reflections** of our
**means** and **goals**]{.underline}.

VII

[The quest for a **reasonable account**]{.underline} of the necessity of
change [does **not** imply that]{.underline} (1) [an act without such
accounts is **by itself illegitimate**]{.underline} -- sometimes we do
things without any reason or clear ideas of what we try to accomplish
that turn out to be of value nevertheless. [But in public exchanges
where we want to **affect others**]{.underline}, [the others should **in
some way come to understand** why change is necessary]{.underline}.

Neither do we want to imply that (2) changes may never come about
without agents being able themselves to give an account of why this is
necessary. Quite often actions and events are conceived in ways that the
initiators did not foresee.

What we are trying to argue here is thus not that the suggested
reflections on positive freedom of expression should replace prevailing
accounts of negative freedom. It may be argued that a freedom of
expression that is only thought through negative accounts of freedom is
problematic, but that is quite another argument and it is not implied by
the above reflections. The reflections merely suggest that [in
**evaluations** of actual public spheres it is **inadequate** merely to
consider the **plurality** of voices]{.underline} (as suggested in the
negatively conceived accounts of the freedom of expression).

This is where we suggest turning our attention towards notions of
courage. [If our **bandwidth of attention** is **limited**]{.underline},
[it is **important** that we]{.underline} in our engagements in the
public spheres [are **not overwhelmed** by **insignificant utterances
that merely affirm existing states of affairs**]{.underline}. For public
deliberation to become democratically fruitful [it is important that we
are attentive to]{.underline} courageously challenging
[statements]{.underline}; challenges [that are]{.underline}, certainly,
[**made comprehensible** to us by the speakers' attempts to **convince
us** of the underlying goals and means]{.underline}.

Certainly, [if these reflections are to **gain any real relevance** they
will need to be **further articulated**]{.underline}, and in such
articulations [it will be **necessary** to **substantiate notions
of**]{.underline} 'life', '**[reasonably]{.underline}**', 'some kind of
goal', etc. And [these]{.underline} substantiations [might **narrow**
the plurality of voices heard]{.underline} in the public.

As demonstrated in the previous sections [the alternative]{.underline}
to doing this [is]{.underline}, however, [**not to make every voice
visible** in the public spheres]{.underline}. [Even though they may
exist]{.underline} in the public sphere, [it is **not certain** that the
limited bandwidth of attention leaves room for their **actually being
heard**]{.underline} by any critical mass.

Insofar as we consider the public spheres not merely as spheres in which
voices should be uttered but also as spheres in which voices should be
heard, [we need some way to **select out** those voices from the chorus
that are **significant in relation to some given context**]{.underline}.
[Unlimited plurality is **not an option**]{.underline}. [The
question]{.underline} thus [becomes **how** plurality should be
**limited**]{.underline}. [Should plurality be limited according to
**explicitly articulated rules** and **norms**]{.underline}, rules and
norms [that can]{.underline}, [due to their **explicit
articulations**]{.underline}, [themselves become **subjects of
dispute**?]{.underline} [Or should plurality be limited according to
**unconscious power structures**]{.underline}, [the rules of the
**strongest**?]{.underline}

### AT: USFG=Assemblage 

#### Defining the USFG as an assemblage does not mean that it does not require government action 

**Vanhanen 10** , Janne Vanhanen PhD in Philosophy from Univ of
Helsinki, ENCOUNTERS WITH THE VIRTUAL The Experience of Art in Gilles
Deleuze's Philosophy ,
https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/19376/encounte.pdf?sequence=1

To characterise the mode of being of the assemblage, Deleuze and
Guattari distinguish two axes in it: material and expressive components,
and processes that can be either stabilising (territorializing) or
destabilising (deterritorializing). The material and expressive
components can be roughly categorised as falling under the axis between
"machinic assemblage of bodies" (affective materiality) and "collective
assemblage of enunciation" (language, semiotics, "incorporeal
transformations").371 This can be schematised as follows: ASSEMBLAGE
Material components ("states of bodies") Territorializing processes
Deterritorializing processes Expressive components ("incorporeal
transformations") An assemblage is, then, "an intermingling of bodies",
material and semiotic, which undergoes processes of strengthening or
disassembling its current identity.372 [[An archetypal example of an
assemblage would]{.underline}]{.mark}, thus, seem to [[be a social
formation]{.underline}]{.mark} of some kind, [[such as a political party
or an institution of state]{.underline}]{.mark}.373
[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} clearly [[consist of]{.underline}]{.mark}
material conditions (workers, material assets, et cetera) and expressive
components ([[rules and regulations]{.underline}]{.mark}, statements,
symbolisations, et cetera) and they undergo phases of stabilisation and
change. [[A forceful instance]{.underline}]{.mark} of this [[is the
juridical system. It is composed of buildings, clerks, officials and
judges, as well as]{.underline}]{.mark} semiotic components such as
[[laws,]{.underline}]{.mark} conducts and practices. It effects
corporeal transformations, producing prisoners and enclosing them in
special quarters and, in addition, incorporeal transformations such as
declaring people guilty or not guilty. Yet, despite the examples
traversing the social field, it must be kept in mind that Deleuze and
Guattari nominate every single thing as an assemblage. The world is
constituted of affects: parts within parts, affecting one another.
Phenomena-as-assemblages exist as "boxes" within boxes, or a set of
Russian dolls, qualified according to spatio-temporal scale and
perspective. There are components great and small, mountains and
molecules, and likewise assemblages. I am an assemblage of myriads of
parts: physico-chemical, biological, cultural, technical. The parts I
consist of are assemblages, too, on their respective levels. The hands
that I type this text with consist of formations of flesh, sinew, bones,
nerves, arteries and so forth. They have an individual history as "my"
hands, and a structural history of the assemblage of human hand evolving
through generations of ancestors, as the hand is a deterritorialized
paw. My fingertips, pressing the keys, are made of biological cells,
which, in turn, consist of molecules which are aggregates of atoms. We
can continue into the sub-atomic level and never encounter the
foundational stratum of reality which would act as a strictly
determining foundation for the "higher" levels.374 Likewise, [[there are
many assemblages of which I am a part]{.underline}]{.mark} of. [[My
family, my university department, my neighbourhood]{.underline}]{.mark},
my nationality, humankind, the whole animal kingdom, planetary organic
matter, Earth, the stellar system, Milky Way, the local system of
galaxies and so forth into massive scale cosmic structures. At any level
of consideration we are dealing with populations, 375 not species, and
with relations of parts to a (relative) whole. And, as mentioned above,
there is also the question of emergence where different entities and
attributes emerge not causally but statistically out of smaller-scale
parts, without the larger-scale entities being reducible to their
constitutive parts, as well as the wider assemblages affecting their
components. As DeLanda phrases it, the world is composed of "nested"
sets of individuals of different spatial and temporal scales.376

#### Do not meet their own interpretation because they do not act through the government as an assemblage---A government as an assemblage means it is an enduring institutional structure with the power to effect all of its parts---They only act through individual parts which is not acting as an assemblage

**Vanhanen 10** , Janne Vanhanen PhD in Philosophy from Univ of

Deleuze's Philosophy ,

The fact that everything is an assemblage does not mean that anything
can become one: [[there are]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[criteria to
ascertain that a certain assemblage is a real and functioning
entity]{.underline}]{.mark} and not merely a random aggregate of parts.
[[First, an assemblage has to possess the power to affect its
constituent parts]{.underline}]{.mark}.377 The ability to do this
functions as the criterion of the assemblage's reality. In theory, any
two -- or more -- entities can be viewed as belonging to a same
assemblage, but [[only those instances of co-existence which bring about
a change in their parts can be considered as really forming an
assemblage.]{.mark} For instance, I might concoct a relation between
myself, the dark side of the moon and every phonograph
record]{.underline} released in June 1958. Clearly, [those parts listed
are not affected by any super-individual unifying assemblage, however
strongly I wished to believe in it]{.underline}. There has to be
consistency for the assemblage to remain over time as the parts are able
to reproduce the assemblage in repetition or retention. Then again,
[[the assemblage of my university department is very much real,
according to the effects it can have on me, my
colleagues]{.underline}]{.mark}, my office furniture, my computer, et
cetera. The appearance of [emergent properties is the second criterion
for assemblages]{.underline}.378 [To continue the example of a
university department, it can bring forth effects that its constituent
parts cannot evoke in isolation]{.underline}. Likewise, [the department
fulfils the third feature of an assemblage, that of redundant
causation]{.underline}. [A university department is not the
"sum]{.underline}" of the histories [of its parts]{.underline}. In a
way, a significant number of its sub-individual parts are
interchangeable, and this is the reason for the power of its continuity
through the years. [Professors, lecturers, students and administrative
staff can come and go, yet the department stays[.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Yet, the Simondonian point of the relationality of individuation must be
brought up as a reminder: the department can, in turn, function as a
sub-individual part in another assemblage, such as the university
faculty or a certain professional sector.

#### This is offense---their conflation of individual action with broader action by the USFG-assemblage makes it impossible to point out and resist the worst excesses of power.

**Dean and Villadsen, 16**---Department of Management, Politics and
Philosophy, Copenhagen Business School (Mitchell and Kaspar, *State
Phobia and Civil Society: The Political Legacy of Michel Foucault* pg
131-132, dml)

It may be argued that the [rendering of the state as **a virtual
structure** does not merely have effects in terms of what is left out of
view, such as]{.underline} legality and legitimacy, [the organization
and coordination of the state and its agencies through law]{.underline},
the state and sovereign capacities, [and coercive]{.underline}
instruments and [social conditions]{.underline}. According to Žižek,
[there is **a particular performativity** in postmodern representations
of the world as a "**permanent becoming**]{.underline}," as deeply
heterogeneous, fragmented, [and intersected by webs of
micropower]{.underline} whose effects and social value cannot be
decided. [This "extremely suspect rhetoric of complexity,"]{.underline}
championed by Foucault and his followers, [portrays power as an
"intricate network of lateral links]{.underline}, left and right, up and
down . . . a clear case of patching up, since one can never arrive at
Power this way" (Žižek 1999, 66). [The rhetoric]{.underline} of
complexity---itself mirroring the use of complexity theory by those such
as Friedrich Hayek (1967)---[**separates** the microprocedures of power
**from any overall system** or structure. The **concrete effect**
renders it **impossible** to **point out someone** as power-holder, to
**perceive some structures as primary** to others, or to conceive of
**some form** of **cultural**, **social**, **political**, or **economic
dominance**]{.underline}. Taking aim at institutional analysis, it can
be argued that [to introduce an ontology of becoming, productive
differences, and free-ﬂowing process easily conveys the image of a
withdrawal of power and control]{.underline}. Thus the play of
differences is set free to unfold in its natural and creative form. No
structural measures of equalization and no major dispositif of power are
needed for such virtuality to thrive and unfold on the newfound planes
of immanence.

We wonder whether, by such means, [this immanence perspective
has]{.underline} not [**systematically occluded key problems** inherent
to the analysis of the state]{.underline}, that is, [of a **historically
speciﬁc set of institutions**]{.underline} separate from rulers and
ruled, [organized through law, and claiming a centralization of
power]{.underline} and supremacy or transcendence within a given domain
or territory. [This ﬁgure **disappears** in the optics of]{.underline}
dispositifs, diagrams and practices, [**multiplicity** and
**immanence**. Not only does the possibility of **the use of sovereign
violence recede**, but other sovereign rights and capacities do so as
well]{.underline}: the monopoly of the ﬁnal decision, of
**[taxation]{.underline}**, of [**lawmaking** and **law enforcement**,
to **declare war**, to **make treaties** with other states, and so on.
One may speculate, **what civil chaos would ensue**, were the state and
its agents to **take seriously** this ﬁeld of virtuality and plane of
immanence?]{.underline}

# Other Off-Case Arguments

## Scalar Competition FW

### Notes (Please Read!)

This is my attempt to reconcile the problem of whether or not kritikal
affs get perms against negative kritiks. I have written some all-purpose
shells for an argument about what perms are and are not legitimate with
K affs without trying to limit out their ability to make perms entirely,
which I am calling "scalar competition." It is not very developed as of
yet, partially because it has not been field-tested in order to see what
people say against it, but also because I haven't had as much time to
write stuff out for it. I encourage you to rework it and research it
yourself!

Scalar competition starts from the premise that the vast majority of K
affs operates at multiple *scales*. "Scale," broadly defined, simply
refers to a *frame of reference*---various parts of the world, society,
etc are or are not relevant to the aff's lens of analysis. For example,
an aff that is about racism both in NATO and in debate is making
arguments at the geopolitical scale and at the scale of debate, an aff
that's just about racism in debate and doesn't talk about any violence
outside of debate is *only* making arguments at the scale of debate, but
neither of those affs are making arguments at the intergalactic scale,
nor are they making arguments at the microbiological scale. Most K affs
look like the first example insofar as they discuss multiple
scales---they make impact arguments about broader social structures, but
have a method that starts at the level of debate.

Following from the idea that K affs generally operate at multiple
scales, scalar competition is the argument that the negative should get
to disprove the aff at any given scale at which the aff's arguments
operate without having to disprove them at *all* scales at which the aff
operates. The reason that this matters is that it sets a clear standard
for what permutations are and are not legitimate---if the negative's
alternative operates at a different scale than the aff's method, but at
the same scale as the aff's impact, then the aff *cannot legitimately
permute* the alternative without first explaining what their method
looks like at the scale of their impact. The burden of proof is on the
affirmative to explain how their method functions at the scale of their
impacts (and thus at the scale of the alternative) before they can
permute it.

There are two shells included. **You should not read both in any given
debate! The 2NC shell is NOT an extension of the 1NC!** Here are notes
on both:

\--1NC: The 1NC shell is intended for teams who want a way to get the
aff to clarify what they defend without reading T-USFG, and/or for teams
who want to separate out the "no perms in a method debate" out onto a
different flow and develop it earlier rather than later. It's a bigger
time investment, and makes the debate a bit weird organizationally, but
it does help you explain your arguments more, which may be worth the
cost for a framework argument like this that's very explicitly not about
rejecting them, but simply about what perms they get.

\--2NC: The 2NC shell is the more all-purpose shell; you can add it to
pretty much any perm block in a 2NC/1NR extension of a K vs a K aff (as
long as it makes sense with your alt, obviously!). It's shorter and will
make the debate less developed, so you have to make sure the judge is
following along when you're explaining in the 2NR, but it certainly has
more general utility than the 1NC shell.

Again, please feel free to develop this argument yourself---I think
"scale" is a really useful concept in K debates broadly. For example, I
think this could be a specification argument rather than a
competition/perm framework argument---make it your own!

-DML

### Shell---1NC

#### Interpretation: The aff should be responsible for defending the application of their method at the scale of their impacts. Evaluate links and alts based on [scalar competition]{.underline}; the neg gets to choose the scale of comparison, and the aff may only permute [within]{.underline} scales, not [across]{.underline} them. 

#### Prefer this framework:

#### [Prior question]{.underline}. Scalar clarity is a [necessary accompaniment]{.underline} to [any mode of inquiry]{.underline}.

**DiCaglio, 21**---Assistant Professor of English, Texas A&M University
(Joshua, "Learning to Scale," *Scale Theory: A Nondisciplinary Inquiry*,
Introduction, 6-9, dml)

[This]{.underline} book traces out the conceptual, perceptual, and
discursive aspects of scale writ large, including how we find ourselves
with scale as a notion, the conditions under which it operates, and the
difficulties it presents for human knowledge built largely on nonscalar
experience. It [tries]{.underline}, first and foremost, [to highlight
**scale** as a]{.underline} certain [way of **thinking** and
**speaking**]{.underline}, [and to **train** the reader in this way of
thinking]{.underline}. I hope to demonstrate that [the **longer you
dwell** with scale]{.underline}, [the **more fundamental** it
appears]{.underline}.

There are three foundational philosophical concepts that [scale
**indelibly alters**]{.underline}. First, scale deals with [the
**delineation** of objects]{.underline}, [**transforming** one field of
objects into others depending on the **scale of inquiry**]{.underline}.
[Scale suggests that any object appears **different**]{.underline}---[or
**does not even exist at all**]{.underline}---[if you **change the
scale** of perception]{.underline}. As two ecologists note, "[If you
move far enough across scales]{.underline}, [the **dominant processes**
change]{.underline}. [It is **not** just that things get **bigger** or
**smaller**]{.underline}, [but the **phenomena themselves**
change]{.underline}."3 [In a **framework of scale**]{.underline},
[objects are **no longer**]{.underline} clearly separate,
[apparent]{.underline}, and self-contained entities "[in
themselves]{.underline}," [since changes in scale reveal that the same
thing also **exists differently**]{.underline}. [All
objects]{.underline}, therefore, [**must be defined** via their **scale
of interaction**]{.underline} and perception. In short, [scale **changes
everything** because it **changes what every thing means**]{.underline}.

Second, because [scale]{.underline} deals with perspective, it [is
**intertwined** with]{.underline} notions of [the subject]{.underline},
[experience]{.underline}, consciousness, [and
interpretation]{.underline}. In applying scale to the body you call
"mine" you find yourself looped into a disorienting question: whose body
is it? The atoms'? The cells'? The planets'? The galaxies'? While this
may seem absurd, this conundrum is already necessitated by scale and is,
I argue, the most fundamental challenge presented by scale. We can only
pretend that objects and relations exist "in themselves" and apart from
these scalar delineations if we leave our conception of ourselves
intact. Doing so makes [scale]{.underline} inevitably abstract; it
[permits us to treat scalar objects as just any other objects and scalar
relations as just more relations]{.underline}. [But scale **ties** those
relations back to our]{.underline} usual **[experience]{.underline}**,
saying that what I am is already atoms, cells, planets, galaxies. But
then who is scaling?

Finally, scale reworks our notions of process, relation, and
organization. Scale presents not only new objects but a tangle of new
relations in two senses: first, [scale reveals relationships that were
**previously not apparent** simply because they were **not
discernible**]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} in turn, scale [provides
new possibilities for **comprehending** these aggregates and
relations]{.underline}. [Schemes of control and
force]{.underline}---[whether called]{.underline}
"**[top-down]{.underline}**," "**[bottom-up]{.underline}**," the "great
chain of being," [or **hierarchy**]{.underline} of things---[contain
presumptions about scale that are **revised** when we carefully examine
this apparatus]{.underline}.

The center of this book (Part II) directly addresses these
reconfigurations, with a chapter devoted to each. But because scale
entails a particular, counterintuitive way of thinking, we must first
experiment with this way of thinking and attempt to make this term
"scale" clear. Thus, Part I provides a series of thought experiments
that define the parameters of scale as I am using it here and train the
reader in thinking in terms of scale.

The Philosophical Status of Scale

Before we begin these experiments, I want to highlight a few ways that
scale has been positioned in theoretical conversations. In discussions
of the "ontological status of scale," [scholars tend to be
**critical**]{.underline} of the concept partially [because it is
**unclear** what scale is]{.underline}.4 Even in accounts favorable to
scale, [scale is said to be an]{.underline} "**[arbitrary mental
device]{.underline}** which allows us to make sense of our existence."5
Or perhaps, "merely a way for humans to perceive and comprehend the
world."6 [Or]{.underline}, as one geographer put it, "[there is **no
such thing**]{.underline} as scale."7 Stripped of their diminutive
qualities, these statements are partially correct: [scale is a
conceptual device]{.underline} that allows us to make sense of our
existence, [but **not**]{.underline} one which is **[entirely
arbitrary]{.underline}**. Scale provides a way for humans to perceive
and comprehend the world, but one that is essential and not necessarily
tied to humans. Finally, scale does not exist, in the sense that
"[scale]{.underline}" [itself is not an **entity** but a **reference**
for the structure of phenomena]{.underline}. The diminutive qualities of
each of these statements relegates scale in relation to the social, the
epistemological, and the ontological, respectively. But scale is not
quite any of these.

[To say that scale is **ontological** would imply that scale **exists
already** as a]{.underline} kind of entity or [fact of the
world]{.underline}. [To say that scale is **epistemological** would
imply that it is a way of **learning** about or **accessing** the
world]{.underline}. [To say that scale is a **social structure** would
imply that scale is **one among many conceptual
frameworks**]{.underline} that society has built for mapping the world.
And yet, scale relies both on the "being" of phenomena and a reference
to the one who is measuring as a means of coming to know being. If we
take the whole scaling process into account, considering whether scale
is an epistemological, ontological, or social construct has less
meaning. Rather, [scale functions at a level **above ontology** and
**epistemology**]{.underline}: [scale is a means of **orienting
yourself** both to experience and to the being of things]{.underline}.
[It is a **metaphenomenal structure** that makes use of a **consistent
measure** to **compare** and **calibrate ourselves** to
phenomena]{.underline}. [Scale]{.underline} does not arise solely from
beings (the ontological) or our mode of accessing beings (epistemology),
but rather [is a way of **systematically organizing** and **comparing**
phenomena as they appear]{.underline}. Scale is an addendum and a
reflecting back on what is discovered phenomenologically, first through
attending to the presentation of the world and then systematically
extending this presentation using a defined measure. In turn, [the
**consistency** of this defined measure]{.underline} then accounts for
the way we are dividing reality, which [means that scale **cannot be
solely a social construct**]{.underline}.

[Once discovered]{.underline}, [scale becomes a **necessary conceptual
adjunct to any mode of inquiry**]{.underline}---[whether we want to
speak of]{.underline} objects (**[ontology]{.underline}**), our learning
about objects (**[epistemology]{.underline}**), [or]{.underline} our way
of organizing, speaking about, and distributing reality
(**[sociality]{.underline}**)---[since the objects in question are
**only** understood through the reorientation mapped by
**scale**]{.underline}. Studying a cell only becomes possible once we
extend our perceptual apparatus to sufficient resolution to identify
cells, but it only becomes coherent when scale orients us to this
perception. [**Regardless** of]{.underline} the
**[ontology]{.underline}** of the cell (whether it actually exists),
[its **epistemological status**]{.underline} (how we find out about it),
[or]{.underline} the **[social aspects]{.underline}** that go into its
discovery (the training required to use a microscope), [scale is
**required** to understand what we mean]{.underline} by "cell."

[Scale provides us with a **reference point** to take note of **how any
phenomenon compares to any other**]{.underline}. [Doing so permits us to
**systematically attend** to how what is is **revised** and
**structured** as beings]{.underline} dissolve, shift,
[combine]{.underline}, [layer]{.underline}, [and relate to each other
**differently** depending on the **scale of examination**]{.underline}.
Scale does not mediate our access to the world; it permits us to make
sense of mediated, extended, and projected experience. This status makes
the scalar relation unlike any other kind of relation we find ourselves
in. When we say that the Earth is made of rocks and the rocks are made
of atoms, we are suggesting that the very being of each phenomenon is
made up of, contained by, and holds reference to the others.

#### [Ground]{.underline}. Allowing the aff to pick and choose the scale of comparison is [unpredictable]{.underline} and [non-reciprocal]{.underline} because they can defend impacts and methods that operate at [different scales]{.underline}.

#### [Critical rigor]{.underline}. Scalar competition ensures that critical debates generate [new forms of life]{.underline} instead of [self-righteous skeptics]{.underline}.

**DiCaglio, 21**---Assistant Professor of English, Texas A&M University

Science," *Scale Theory: A Nondisciplinary Inquiry*, Chapter 10,
202-207, dml) \[language modifications denoted by brackets\]

This last option is not readily apparent in Latour's philosophy, even as
he moves from "critique to concern" in his reckoning with the science
wars. [This simple question]{.underline}---**[what are we talking
about?]{.underline}**---[points us to the ways that]{.underline}
scientific [descriptions **pull us out** of the scale at which we live
and require that we **adjust our**]{.underline}
this-**[scale]{.underline}** behavior on the basis of this reconfiguring
of reality. On the one hand, this is all the more reason we need to
figure out new ways to keep intact these matters of fact, so that we can
make these extensions with some degree of confidence. On the other hand,
these matters of fact are not enough. They become matters of concern not
because they are constructed equally by other actants but because they
run into tension with a this-scale, human way of understanding
reality---when I have [to **reconcile**]{.underline} the struggles of my
life (paying rent, keeping a job, raising my kids) with [the confusing
scalar implications that **connect together** one scalar
object]{.underline} (economics) [with another]{.underline} (ecology) [in
a way that is **not immediately apparent** and **easy to
grasp**]{.underline}.

In this light, we can wonder about Latour's move to concern. While I am
sympathetic with his echoing of Haraway's aim for a
[discourse]{.underline} designed "to protect and to care," "matters of
concern" [seems to]{.underline} also [imply an overbearing scrutiny
**regardless** of whether or not the thing is **clearly
understood**]{.underline}---[or even if we're certain that we're
**talking about the same thing**]{.underline}.35 Is this not already
what happens when science becomes entangled in a concern---about
vaccines, climate change, women's bodies, health-care systems, fracking
sites, clean water, or mask mandates? Latour argues that facts are
closed while points of concern are open, ready to be composed and
recomposed. Yet both facts and these points of concern run into the
problem of doxa, the marriage of opinion with social expectation, where
[everyone proceeds as if the issues at hand are **clear** and the points
of concern are **shared**]{.underline}. In addition, we can follow
Latour's concern about critique and consider the affect here: does
concern not imply worry, of being concerned about your neighbor, certain
that something is wrong, that I must get involved and intervene? Is this
not the unfortunate result of this insistent sociality? Like parents
concerned about their teenager who has been staying out late---and have
you seen what he's been wearing? (and he spends so much time alone)---we
find ourselves plagued with an excess of concern as we contemplate our
scalar entanglements. Is this the attitude with which we will approach
our dear Gaia or our fellow actants?

In this light, [we can]{.underline} further reposition the idea of
critique and push against Latour's critique of critique in order to
[rediscover this **more strictly critical maneuver**]{.underline}:
[discovering what is **not understood** in what we **think** we
understand]{.underline}. Latour's characterization of critique is both
egoic and suspicious, as if the critical move is inherently (1) about
me, the critic, getting the upper hand, being more informed, and less
naive, and (2) wary or even disdainful of the thing that is being
critiqued. Certainly, [there is]{.underline} a real target here (Latour
puts his early work among them), and we need to scrub criticism of this
attitude.36 But Latour uses that characterization to throw out what
remains [an **essential move**]{.underline}: [attending to the
**conditions**]{.underline}, **[parameters]{.underline}**,
**[limits]{.underline}**, [and **implications** of a mode of
knowledge]{.underline}. [Critique does not have to be
**suspicious**]{.underline}; [it does not need to **reduce** an object
to something else]{.underline} (e.g., [your **distress** to a **death
drive**]{.underline}); [it does not need to be an **ego trip** where you
are the **enlightened one bearing the truth** to the
ignorant]{.underline}. Latour mixes up the general tenor of "being
critical" with the Kantian operation he insists that we get beyond: the
task of observing how, within any particular experience, there are
conditions, assumptions, and components that we may not be aware of but
that can and should be examined.

It simply is not true that "what performs a critique cannot also
compose."37 [Criticism is needed because we **already suppose too much**
about reality]{.underline}. [There are already social
practices]{.underline}, [languages]{.underline}, [cultural
regulations]{.underline}, [personal sentiments]{.underline},
[technological infrastructures]{.underline}, [genetic
inheritances]{.underline}, [energy grids]{.underline}, [oil
sources]{.underline}, [residual wastes **slowly dissolving** in the
ocean]{.underline}---[all of which must be **examined** and **reopened**
for us to forge **new forms of existence**]{.underline}. Is it not
strange that Latour would say that "With a hammer . . . you can do a lot
of things . . . but you cannot repair, take care, assemble, reassemble,
stitch together"?38 Need I point out that people do all kinds of repairs
and assembling with a hammer? Surely Latour, who would so readily have
us rethink our conception of science, politics, and things, understands
that if you're going to repave a road, you must first dig it up?

How bewildering! Do we know what we are haggling about?
[This]{.underline}, it seems to me, [is the **fundamental question**
brought on by a **basic critical impulse**]{.underline}: **[what is it
that we are talking about?]{.underline}** **[Is it as clear as it seems
to be?]{.underline}** I'm not taking the strategy shared by Bloor and
Sokal and simply accusing Latour of obscurantism; rather, I am pointing
to a set of more basic questions prompted by a different affect meant to
set stage for a different conversation. What is Latour referring to, for
instance, by "nature" when he insists that "ecology seals the end of
nature"?39 When he says "all the various notions of nature" does he mean
Emerson's nature and the one that evolved in frontier America, and the
national parks movement, and the one assumed by physicists, and the one
environmentalists are trying to save? No. In Latour's own work he means
particular notions and stances tied to this term "nature," such as the
world conceived as a place apart or an object to be dominated by a
knowing subject. Such aspects, uncovered by critique, do not themselves
totalize "nature" in a way that warrants such strong dismissals.

In their deconstructive form, [these questions arise]{.underline} from
bewilderment, in the not-understanding and confusion that is taken as
neither mine (my inability to understand, my not being properly trained
in your discipline) nor yours (your obscurantism) but [as a way past
**pretending to understand** or that there is **only one way** that
descriptions work]{.underline}, [experiences are
configured]{.underline}, [or actions are performed]{.underline}. **[What
are we even talking about?]{.underline}** **[To what does it
apply?]{.underline}** **[How might that be understood?]{.underline}**
**[How do we know it?]{.underline}** **[What is not accounted
for]{.underline}** in this articulation or mode of
knowing**[?]{.underline}** **[How can we work with it?]{.underline}** In
their most productive forms, these questions hinge on wonder: I wonder
what X is? What if we try X? **[How does X relate to Y?]{.underline}**
Can there be something else here? Bewilderment is the feeling one gets
in a tangle, the "confusion arising from losing one's way"; it is the
acknowledgment of the labyrinthine form of our attempt to understand
where we are, what we are doing, and what we are saying (OED). Wonder
arises from the astonishment with objects, things, ideas. The two
affects are complementary, both moving us to appreciate anew and ask
again, more carefully, with less certainty and more interest.40

The same questions could be asked of **[skeptical]{.underline}**
scientists such as Sokal when they adopt the same strong [modes of
rhetoric]{.underline}, which [assume **too much common ground** in the
understanding of the **terms** and **acceptable forms of
proof**]{.underline}. [Skepticism]{.underline} is the counterpart to
critical suspicion; it [risks **hiding** the need to
**specify**]{.underline}, **[trace conditions]{.underline}**, [and
**withhold certainty** behind an **egoic**]{.underline}, **[superior
affect]{.underline}**. In [this]{.underline} form, as Latour fairly
notes, skepticism [has been excellent for]{.underline}
"**[debunking]{.underline}** quite a lot of [beliefs]{.underline},
powers, and illusions," [but it is also **reaching its
limits**]{.underline}.41 [The problem arises when scientists make
skepticism into an **attitude** based in authority and **mistake**
their]{.underline} highly regimented [mode of specification for the
**only mode** of parsing the world]{.underline}.42

By way of illustration, one can wonder what would have happened if Carl
Sagan had taken a different approach in the conversation he recounts at
the beginning of Demon-Haunted World. There, he finds himself in the car
with a driver who, upon finding out that he's "that scientist guy,"
begins to question him about "frozen extraterrestrials languishing in an
Air Force base near San Antonio, 'channeling' . . . , crystals, the
prophecies of Nostradamus, astrology, the shroud of Turin." With each
new topic, says Sagan, "I had to disappoint him. 'The evidence is
crummy,' I kept saying. 'There's a much simpler explanation.'"43
[Instead of]{.underline} being skeptical, [assuming the role as the
**arbiter of truth**]{.underline}, [and simply **recounting the evidence
for** and **against such things**]{.underline}, Sagan could have asked
something different: to what is he referring? I've wondered about
channeling . . . what is it describing? Why are we so certain these are
spirits? What do we mean by that? Undoubtedly these questions can be
disarming, and they probably would have confused the driver. But, if
done with more nuance and less ego, [this approach can respect that
there is some **configuration** toward reality being expressed
here]{.underline}. **[What is it?]{.underline}** [These
questions]{.underline}, if adequately shared, [can induce a **mutual
bewilderment** from which we can start to have a **conversation** about
these different kinds of questions]{.underline}, [what they apply
to]{.underline}, [why we hold to them]{.underline}, [and what they serve
to do]{.underline}.

It certainly is harder to have this kind of conversation with ideas like
Atlantis. But many of the things described by science are closer to
Atlantis than they are to the immediacies of one's life---and harder to
wrap one's head around. In science, bewilderment is thus the first step
toward working with these broader difficulties and reorientations. This
is the method of the current project: it began with a bewilderment (how
is it possible that I am simultaneously atoms, cells, quarks, ecologies,
galaxies?) and a wondering (how does this apparatus function? Why does
it show up in everything from descriptions of mystical union with God to
descriptions of ecological entrainment? But also: have you seen the
"Inner Life of the Cell"?!).44 The method then proceeded by
criticism---a [tracing]{.underline} of [the **conditions** under which
**scale can be articulated**]{.underline}---but also through other
methods of textual exegesis, historical questioning, comparative
analysis, and thought experiment. In many ways, I can hardly get past
the first detail, the basic structure of scale; I keep unfolding more
considerations out of this fractal question that might simply be reduced
to a word, with an affect: scale?!

Yet as the breadth of this inquiry implies, such bewilderment [can be
productive of **new avenues of discussion** as we **unfold a simple
point in the many contexts in which it inevitably
applies**]{.underline}. [It is an invitation to **step back** from the
things assumed]{.underline} (the critical maneuver, but here performed
mutually, starting first with the critic's confusion and willingness to
admit an impasse) [but also to **specify**]{.underline} (Say more about
what you mean by that? I'm not sure that we're talking about the same
thing. I've often wondered . . .). Perhaps [such an affect and
intellectual stance are **difficult** to maintain]{.underline}. But I
wonder if this is only [because we get **so involved** in the
matter]{.underline}, [concerned about its **implications**]{.underline},
[its **problematic uses**]{.underline}, [its **terrible
associations**]{.underline}, [its **naïveté**]{.underline}. My
experience is that [such conversations end in **discord** primarily
because someone]{.underline}, [at some point]{.underline}, [invokes
**authority**]{.underline}, [insists on]{.underline} his
\[[their]{.underline}\] **[understanding]{.underline}**, [or simply
**runs out of energy**]{.underline} (pick it up again tomorrow?). Is
this not a practice for humanists to take up: helping ourselves and
others step back from this insistent sense of knowing, to trace these
disjunctures, and help ourselves navigate these bewildering
transformations of our existence?45

### Shell---2NC

#### Evaluate perms through [scalar competition]{.underline}. The aff should be responsible for defending the application of their method [at scale]{.underline}, and the neg should get to choose the scale of comparison.

Introduction, 6-9, dml)

[This]{.underline} book traces out the conceptual, perceptual, and
discursive aspects of scale writ large, including how we find ourselves
with scale as a notion, the conditions under which it operates, and the
difficulties it presents for human knowledge built largely on nonscalar
experience. It [tries]{.underline}, first and foremost, [to highlight

change]{.underline}. [It is **not** just that things get **bigger** or

[Scale provides us with a **reference point** to take note of **how any
phenomenon compares to any other**]{.underline}. [Doing so permits us to
**systematically attend** to how what is is **revised** and
**structured** as beings]{.underline} dissolve, shift,
[combine]{.underline}, [layer]{.underline}, [and relate to each other
**differently** depending on the **scale of examination**]{.underline}.
Scale does not mediate our access to the world; it permits us to make
sense of mediated, extended, and projected experience. This status makes
the scalar relation unlike any other kind of relation we find ourselves
in. When we say that the Earth is made of rocks and the rocks are made
of atoms, we are suggesting that the very being of each phenomenon is
made up of, contained by, and holds reference to the others.

### AT: Cross-Scale Perms Good

#### Cross-scalar permutations [distort]{.underline} critique and [preclude]{.underline} actualizing their method---four warrants. They [ignore]{.underline} scalar thresholds, [overlay]{.underline} scales without identifying connections and differences, [obscure]{.underline} scalar origins, and [overwrite]{.underline} scalar concerns with their own priorities.

**DiCaglio, 21**---Assistant Professor of English, Texas A&M University
(Joshua, "The Cosmos Seeing Itself: Representations of Scale, Scales of
Representation," *Scale Theory: A Nondisciplinary Inquiry*, Chapter 11,
228-231, dml)

Because scalar perspectives can only be encountered through some
representation, and because they are so counter to our usual way of
experiencing the world, [we find ourselves with all kinds of
**distortions**]{.underline}, **[tricks]{.underline}**, [and **erroneous
depictions** of scale]{.underline}. I want to pause here to discuss four
kinds of scale tricks that lay the groundwork for what Derek Woods has
already named "scale critique."15

[The **first** is the assumption that something might get larger or
smaller **indefinitely**]{.underline}. It is partially to target this
kind of distortion that we, at 1.31, separated Gulliver's scaling from
the kind of scaling we are dealing with here. The essential difference
is that Gulliver's scaling takes given objects and makes them larger or
smaller, whether in actual scaling of operations (the growth of an
elephant, tree, or business) or in representations (e.g., Godzilla or
King Kong). [These kinds of scale are]{.underline} usually
**[conflated]{.underline}**, because discussions of scale often start
with an object in view; we then consider how such things get larger or
smaller. The distinction highlights the limits to this scaling of
objects, particularly for living systems (see 3.29). [Distortions of
these limits can be relatively harmless]{.underline} and even
educational (e.g., the classic trope of shrinking small enough to go
into the body). **[However]{.underline}**, they do not provide good
training in scalar thinking. More importantly, [they **indulge the
tendency** to think of things as capable of extending their reach
indefinitely **despite the inevitability of scalar
thresholds**]{.underline}.

This notion that growth might expand indefinitely, especially in an
economic sense, has been extensively critiqued, most recently by the
anthropologist Anna Tsing.16 Tsing notes that the "term 'scalability'
had its original home not in technology but in business. Scalability in
business is the ability of a firm to expand without changing the nature
of what it does."17 Tsing rightly examines the tension between
ecological constraints and economic fantasies of unlimited expansion,
which she situates in the unintended effects of agricultural
expansion.18 At the same time, her [arguments]{.underline} about
nonscalability [**misrepresent** the problem as an issue with the
precision of **scale itself**]{.underline}. [The problem is]{.underline}
not the "precision-nested scales" but [**rather** a **fantasy** about
the **indefinite scaling** of objects that is itself undone by
**carefully attending** to scale]{.underline} (3.29).19

[The **second** scale trick is the **overlaying** of two **very
different perspectives** without a **scalar notation** marking this
difference]{.underline}. In 2.19 we noted that one way of making these
distortions in film is to overlay two perspectives in the same field of
vision. [This creates a **distortion**]{.underline}, since the eye does
not have a way to distinguish the two perspectives and therefore treats
them as one. In this technique we have a clear image of how [we perform
this overlaying in **many**]{.underline} images,
**[descriptions]{.underline}**, [and **terms**]{.underline},
particularly those [that **bridge two scale domains**]{.underline}. For
instance, in 3.32--33 we noted that "all humans" is a term that bridges
two scales; humans are only visible at the meter scale, yet this
grouping pulls our perspective to the ecological. As we noted at 3.24,
these maneuvers are not always a problem. [The **problem** arises when
the **connection** between scale domains is **forgotten**]{.underline}.
For example, take the term Anthropocene, which has recently become a
rallying point for thinking about the effect of humans on the planet:
like the conflated perspectives in film, this term wraps together a
this-scale object (humans) with a planet-scale one (geological patterns)
in both space and time. Many writers on the Anthropocene are attempting
to productively separate these two notions of the human. Thus, Dipesh
Chakrabarty's four theses on the Anthropocene clarify the scalar nature
of this term:

We can become geological agents only historically and collectively, that
is, when we have reached numbers and invented technologies that are on a
scale large enough to have an impact on the planet itself. To call
ourselves geological agents is to attribute to us a force on the same
scale as that released at other times when there has been a mass
extinction of species.20

Chakrabarty acknowledges the differences in scale that make planetary
effects possible. The tie between "Anthropocene" and the human is thus
essential for highlighting the relation between the two different scales
of interaction.21 At the same time, the [ambiguity]{.underline} of the
"us" for the attribution of agency and the work performed "historically
and collectively" [creates a potential scalar conflation]{.underline}
that manifests as the double binds of environmentalism that we noted in
chapter 9: [we both are and are not the agents]{.underline}. But [this
is]{.underline} also [why]{.underline} Woods has highlighted [scale
variance]{.underline}---[the way objects change across
scales]{.underline}---[as essential for scale critique]{.underline}: to
get from humans to the Anthropocene, one must first cross a scale domain
where this phenomenon "human" now becomes something different.22

[The **third** scale trick is **forgetting** the scale
**you**]{.underline} ([or **any given action**]{.underline}) [are
on]{.underline}. As we saw in 1.14, the human body does not change
scales even in scalar perceptions such as the view from space. In a more
general sense, [we **always risk mistaking** these scalar extensions and
perceptions as a **displacement** of the capacities tied to these
bodies]{.underline}. We generalized this in 3.34 in the phrase "**[one
can only act on the scale on which one exists]{.underline}**." We have
seen a potent conceptual version of this in Thomas Nagel's distorted
view from nowhere in chapter 8. Likewise, in chapter 9 we discussed Erik
Drexler's fantasies of extension as an example of misplacing the scale
of the engineer. [These problems **naturally arise** as we learn to
develop and work with scalar extensions and scalar
relations]{.underline}. We can follow Timothy Clarke and Joanna Zylinska
in calling these "scalar derangements," since [they are **distorted
fantasies** of extension to and intervention on other
scales]{.underline}, [while **forgetting** both **where one is acting
from** and **what scale requires** for such action]{.underline}. Thus
Clarke's examples of derangements of scale include the "you control
climate change" trope.23 [Such rhetoric avoids the **most difficult
aspect**]{.underline} of ecology: [the need to **rethink the here** in
relation to **new data** about collective endeavors **without reducing**
one to the other]{.underline}.24

[A **fourth**]{.underline} object of scale critique [is **scalar
overwriting**]{.underline}, [in which concerns from one
scale]{.underline} (usually the meter scale and filtered according to
human needs) [are **mapped** onto another scale]{.underline}. We are
familiar with this overwriting in mapping software such as Google Earth,
which makes it easy to draw human points of interest onto the surface of
the Earth. This operation is standard practice in mapmaking; this is one
reason why we distinguished cartographic scales from scale itself at
1.32. The major risk here is that [such overwriting permits you to
retain the priorities and points of interest from another
scale]{.underline}. Doing so can be essential for scalar reorientation,
since it assists us in tracing elements relevant for another scale, such
as describing DNA in terms of what it might produce at the level of the
body or when a particular bacteria or toxin produces organism-level
effects (as was performed in 6.14--17). However, [in such overwriting we
need to attend to **which terms apply** to which scale and
**how**]{.underline}; [otherwise we end up with]{.underline} one of the
**[distortions]{.underline}** just discussed.

Combining this mapping with the above scalar distortions, critiques of
satellite imagery and similar scalar cartographies bring our attention
to how views of different scales can be accompanied by attempts to
overwrite and claim such scales. For example, the architect Laura
Kurgan's extensive critique of satellite imagery traces the way that
such devices are put into service for various ends, from the domestic to
the military.25 Such critiques trace out the conditions for the use and
production of these images so that we can test claims such as whether
"high-resolution satellites . . . signify global transparency."26
Importantly, the abuses of this ability to visualize are often a result
of exaggerated claims reliant on scale tricks and distortions. Thus,
Kurgan notes, in a way that mirrors discussions of visualizing
nanotechnology or microbiology, that "no satellite image presents a
simple, unambiguous picture of the Earth, and a visit to the site itself
can often raise more questions than it answers."27

In all four instances, scale critique would be the process of comparing
these representations of scale with how scale functions in practice. The
notion of scale tricks or distortions requires (1) scale as a consistent
standard, (2) tying together the two perceptions, and (3) locating the
perspectives, including the one that is hidden (usually in the viewer).
However, this operation conflicts with a common tenet of cultural
criticism, since it requires a reference to a standard. Thus, Tsing and
Woods both take issue with the notion of consistency and precision in
scale. To be clear, [scale does **not** require a return to a **truth
standard** of representation for a world taken as given in
itself]{.underline}, [**nor** is it a **tyranny of
precision**]{.underline}. The precision here is based on the standard
implemented by scale, which produces a consistent means of accounting
for our observational shifts. [Because scale is about
observation]{.underline}, [the standard of scale is a **holding
ourselves accountable** for these shifts in observation]{.underline}
(2.20). [This is why scale is **so powerful for critique**]{.underline}:
[scale's simple yet precise accounting for these changes in observation
**provides a standard** for **critiquing distortions** in our perception
of reality]{.underline} and the way we impose on scalar views
assumptions derived from a nonscalar, human-based lifeworld.

### AT: View From Nowhere

#### Scalar comparison is the [opposite]{.underline} of a view from nowhere, it's a recognition that our perspectives are [invariably limited]{.underline} by our [scalar experience]{.underline}!

**DiCaglio, 21**---Assistant Professor of English, Texas A&M University
(Joshua, "Transformations by Involution: The Contemplative Practices of
Scale, Scaling Contemplation," *Scale Theory: A Nondisciplinary
Inquiry*, Chapter 12, 251-254, dml)

The academic argument around mysticism provides a site where this
[**tension** has played out]{.underline}, beginning **[in]{.underline}**
a **[debate]{.underline}** between the philosophers W. T. Stace and
Steven T. Katz.27 Stace sought a basis for mysticism by defining
features of what Robert K. C. Forman later called the "pure
consciousness event." Stace claims that this experience is shared by all
mystics but is articulated differently depending on the cultural and
linguistic tools available.28 In response, Katz argued, in a move
recognizable after the linguistic turn, that all mystical experience
must be inseparable from language and therefore reliant on the
historical and cultural milieu.29 Grace Jantzen later combined Katz's
position with the articulation we saw from Haraway in chapter 8,
[arguing that]{.underline} "[there are **no views from
nowhere**]{.underline}, and there are no views from everywhere. There
are **[only]{.underline}** views **[from somewhere]{.underline}**, [and
the particular place will have an **inescapable effect** on what can be
seen]{.underline}."30 Similarly, Richard King, invoking Hans-Georg
Gadamer's argument that interpretation is foundational to being and that
prejudice in interpretation is inevitable, claims that "[there is
**no**]{.underline} possibility of a [**universally applicable
metanarrative** or **bird's-eye view** of reality]{.underline}."31
Further, King states that "the process of interpreting a text,
then . . . inevitably involves the projections of one's own values,
interest, and agenda onto the text."32

Our discussion of [scalar experience presents]{.underline} three
[**problems** for this critique]{.underline}. First, [scalar experience
suggests]{.underline} a potential explanation for a pure consciousness
event: it is a moment of [moving **past** what one **thinks** one is and
one's **exclusive reliance** on the reality of human-bound
concepts]{.underline}. It is the brain realizing that it solidifies its
own divisions--- especially this division called the "self." As we saw
throughout Part II, [this **reorientation** is the arrival
at]{.underline} the open position beyond a given set of divisions and
values, [the position from which **new positions**]{.underline},
**[judgments]{.underline}**, [and **scales** might emerge]{.underline}.
[To **deny** this possible state and to insist on the **inevitable
hold** of language is to **bind** ourselves in the
**shadowy**]{.underline}, [**ill-defined domain** of the]{.underline}
"[human]{.underline}." But even scientific descriptions of scale
indicate that this is not our situation. Second, this attempt to
indelibly tie language or culture to experience is another example of a
social counterpart to the physical claim that neuronal configurations
cause experience. Third, and most importantly, [if contemplative
practice is already about **examining structures of
judgment**]{.underline}---and pure consciousness events only manifest in
or as this movement---[then how can we ascribe the experience to these
very things being **looked at**]{.underline}, given up, [and
**transformed**?]{.underline} [We are]{.underline} thus [led not to
**prejudice**]{.underline} ([in the sense of **pre-given
judgments**]{.underline}) [but to the **resistance** to examining
prejudice that **prevents us from rescaling our linguistic** and
**social reference points**]{.underline}. [When we insist that
linguistic and cultural aspects are **inevitable** and
**inescapable**]{.underline}, [we **impose**]{.underline} a content of
the brain, [a **human conceptual framework**]{.underline}, [and a
**scalar delimitation**]{.underline} of objects and identity [**back**
onto the experience that is about the **undermining** of these very
contents]{.underline}. Content and prejudices are not left out of the
account; they themselves are transformed in the process. Is this not the
transformation needed as we recognize engrained structures of prejudice?

This maneuver of looking back at one's judgments is a persistent trope
in contemplative rhetoric. For example, Augustine's transformation is
described in terms of a scalar reflection with the major obstacle being
his preexisting cognitive preferences. The whole operation required that
he take into account his own mind: "Because I could not perceive them in
the mind, I thought that I could not perceive my mind itself."33 The
problem is that Augustine does not know what his own psychical
prejudices are: "I had no clear idea," he states again and again, "even
of my own self " (119). The shape of this breaking down required a
turning back upon his desires and thoughts. This turn back upon oneself
is an essential trope---the Greek tropos itself meaning "turn"---by
which the experience or realization is made possible. Thus, Augustine,
upon hearing a story of another's conversion, states:

As he spoke, you, O Lord, turned me back upon myself. You took me from
behind my own back, where I had placed myself because I did not wish to
look upon myself. . . . I looked, and I was filled with horror, but
there was no place for me to flee to away from myself. If I tried to
turn my gaze from myself . . . once again you placed me in front of
myself, and thrust me before my own eyes. (156)

Augustine actively resists looking back at the aspects of himself that
would become implicated in the conversion being demanded. Rather than a
result of his prejudice or predisposition, this prejudice has to come
into view as the very thing to be transformed.

The same applies with the scalar visions we have seen throughout this
work. Because the vision is about what I think I am, I must allow this
prejudice to come into view and have it reworked by this new
perspective. Undoubtedly, [it is **difficult** to implicate oneself into
the scalar loop]{.underline}, to place one's prized conceptions,
preferences, and prejudices within this extended measure. Given this
difficulty, we can say that excessive skepticism tends to prevent
individuals from allowing their attention to dwell on the scalar
relationship long enough to process their own place in it. Augustine
himself was, prior to conversion, one such skeptic. [The difference
hinges not on **how** critical or objective a person is but rather
**what** one is critical and objective about]{.underline}: [the
**structures of thought** and **habit** within oneself]{.underline}.
Augustine resists this whole operation: "I knew what it was, but I
pretended not to; I refused to look at it and put it out of my memory"
(156). This is a failure of being critical that masquerades as a
criticism: the unwillingness to face his own structure of mind leads him
to push it away, to suspect the apparent shift before him.

From this perspective, contemplative rhetoric often describes the
operation of looking back at calcified cognitive structures as a
surrender or realignment of will. Augustine, for instance, uses the
language of linking formed by the investments of this body: "For in
truth lust is made out of a perverse will, and when lust is served, it
becomes habit, and when habit is not resisted, it becomes necessity. But
such links, joined one to another, as it were---for this reason I have
called it a chain---a harsh bondage held me fast" (151). We can read
"lusts" here as the psychical investment in the things around us, the
normal objects of value and importance, and the bodily needs that demand
attention and addressing. [Their importance becomes **engrained** in the
**scalar configuration** of neurons]{.underline}, [social
mores]{.underline}, [and conceptions of need that leads us to
**persistently reaffirm** their structure and power in our everyday
engagement with them]{.underline}. [A different scale view
**contradicts**]{.underline}, **[reworks]{.underline}**, [or
**reorients** these linkages]{.underline}. Thus, Augustine is able to
discern these two kinds of belief and emotional investment: those
derived from the normalized human-confined structure and the larger,
transformed values. Yet in this inward looking the conflict is only
perpetuated by associating the difference with an ego structure: "It was
by me that this habit had been made so warlike against me, since I had
come willingly to this point where I now willed not" (151). When this
war between the wills is released, the links themselves can be dissolved
of their power. It was, however, not the belief that did so, but the
surrender of it: "This was the sum of it: not to will what I willed and
to will what you willed" (167).34 The persistent surrender and
transformation of one's beliefs, will, and prejudice are thus necessary
to create a sustained transformation. An event of the sort exemplified
by Taylor may start this process but be insufficient for a complete and
ongoing reconfiguration of such engrained linkages.

Apart from this question about mystical experience, this account of
prejudice is a way of rethinking the function of cultural theory more
generally. Outside of the critical attitude diagnosed by Bruno Latour
(see chapter 10), cultural critique can be seen as one means of tracing
out the possibilities of humans configuring themselves in relation to
reality. [The purpose of]{.underline} such [critique **cannot be simply
diagnostic** but must become **transformative**]{.underline}: [we must
**grapple** with these remnants of erroneous and harmful ideas and
confusions]{.underline} such as those called prejudice. [To **simply
find**]{.underline} these **[linkages]{.underline}** in others, [to
**identify them**]{.underline} in our cultural narratives, [or to say
that we are **bound** by them **risks voiding the whole operation from
the start**]{.underline}. Crucially, this is the whole terrain already
mapped by contemplative rhetoric: contemplative rhetoric begins with the
assumption that examining and transforming one's structure of mind is
not some trivial endeavor but rather a difficult yet worthwhile process.

## Ruptural Politics K

### K---1NC

#### Voting affirmative uses the ballot to position the 1AC as an [emancipatory rupture]{.underline} that [rescues]{.underline} political agency from metaphysical subjugation. 

**Nayar, 17**---associate professor and director of the International
Development Law and Human Rights LLM Program at the School of Law,
University of Warwick (Jayan, "Some Thoughts on the "(Extra)Ordinary":
Philosophy, Coloniality, and Being Otherwise," Alternatives: Global,
Local, Political, Vol 42, Issue 1, 2017, dml)

[Aside from the **dire actualities** of]{.underline} the
**[biopolitics]{.underline}** of "populationization," [the effects
of]{.underline} "**[individualization]{.underline}**" that has ensnared
the subject perhaps [pose a greater disappointment to the
philosopher]{.underline}. The problem, simply put, is a crisis of the
"present": the apparent complacent condition of being that has come to
define the settled present of a domesticated subject. As Zygmunt Bauman
observed, the "imagination" that underpins the "postpolitical,"
"postmodern" consensus of neoliberal "liquid modernity," the result of
the global consolidation of capitalism, is one [whereby the **much
vaunted subject** is concerned more with]{.underline} the "mining" of
"disengaged" [**happiness** and less with any **historic
mission**]{.underline} for an enlightened humanity.25 It would appear,
the enticements of consumerism and entrepreneurism, more than some
resurrection of a political subject into history defines the
(post)modern condition of being. And the consequence of this emptying
out of "the political" from the subject? Precarious beingness and being
"precariat" now are now recognised as the "normal" conditions of modern
subjectivity.26

Through all this, [the philosopher]{.underline}, it [would
appear]{.underline}, stands **[abandoned]{.underline}** by her subject.
[The **abdication** by the subject of]{.underline} her "historic"
[responsibility]{.underline} of becoming-being-in-the-political [is an
**ongoing disappointment** for any critical]{.underline}
political--legal [philosopher]{.underline} who takes the universal
promise of the "Enlightenment" seriously; [it is]{.underline} after all
[the **repudiation**]{.underline}, [by embodied actual
beings]{.underline}, [of the philosophically ascribed role of the
political subject to be the maker of history]{.underline}. [**Rescue**
is **necessary** therefore]{.underline}; recovery of the foundational
promise of the Enlightenment is, for the philosopher of rupture,
imperative. And so, we understand the reasons for the following
refinements to the original birth story of the political subject that we
find in much current critical thinking:

That [to be denied being-(in the) political]{.underline}, [is to be
either in **abjection** or in **stupor**]{.underline}, [in **ontological
nothingness**]{.underline} as inexistent, [or]{.underline}
meaninglessness [as a **commodity**]{.underline}, a thing not worthy of
the legacy of the idea of Europe. The former is the state of "rightless"
exclusion that concerned Arendt and her philosophical progeny, it is the
condition of abandonment that preoccupies post-Agambenian philosophers
of biopolitical sovereignty. The latter is the perceived condition of
the contemporary biopolitical subject object of governmentality---the
"counted" and the "accounted-for," self-disciplining, held docile, and
domesticated to be nothing useful other than as "entrepreneurial citizen
consumers"---that is the object of disappointment if not contempt. And
so, [the crisis of the present necessitates efforts to]{.underline}
revive, if not **[rescue]{.underline}**, even resurrect, [the political
subject from either **abandoned deprivations** or]{.underline}
hedonistic [**automatonity** and]{.underline} **[consumptive
banality]{.underline}**.

That becoming subject, therefore, is the continuing ontological
potentiality of ruptural emancipation. Becoming subject, thus, is an
ever incomplete project of becoming--being in history.

With this critical reformulation of the idea, we arrive at the present
problem to "invent," as Badiou put it, the "problem of the present";27
[it becomes the **task of the philosopher** to **identify the critical
moments**]{.underline} whereupon might history be glimpsed in events
**[of rupture]{.underline}**, of becomings. We see variously therefore
that [the intention to **reclaim** some presumed emancipatory
content]{.underline} to these related foundational assumptions of human
beingness [**permeate** through]{.underline} the vast majority of
[critical thinking]{.underline} on the subject of the subject in the
political. The question that is addressed in such contemplations of the
present is: how to rescue the emancipatory potentiality of the subject
from the normalizations, and banalizations, of the present?28 As Badiou
poses it,

"How are we to be faithful to changing the world within the world
itself?" This becomes: How are we to weave in the world the political
truth whose historic condition of possibility was the event, without it
being able to be the realization of this possibility? How are we to
inscribe politically, as active materiality under the sign of the Idea,
a reawakening of History?29

And so we understand the particular preoccupation of the contemporary
critical philosopher with the street.

[We witness the **incessant search** by philosophers]{.underline} of
radical hope [for such evental]{.underline} and heroic
[happenings]{.underline}; [so is the world **scoured for ruptural
articulations**]{.underline}, [so are peoples' struggles **ascribed
meaning** vis-a-vis the **constitutive categories** of]{.underline}
modern political--legal [philosophy]{.underline}. [From the past are the
**French** and **American Revolutions**]{.underline} (and their
enunciations of universal subject beingness) [tracked through to the
**Russian** and **Chinese Revolutions**]{.underline} ([less so the
**Haitian** and **Mexican**]{.underline}), [the revolts of
**1968**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} now (jumping a few decades) to
the [antiglobalization movements post **Seattle**]{.underline}, [the
**Occupy movements**]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} "**[Arab
Spring]{.underline}**," [all **grist to the mill** of the philosopher in
search of **signs** that faith in the subject of the political may be
**redeemed**]{.underline}, that history itself may be reawakened. For
the purpose of the Idea, therefore, are the instances of irruptions
sought to be revisited, read repeatedly, and referred to in their many
and varied interpretations as (potential) instances of
becoming---[as]{.underline} Badiouian **[event]{.underline}**, as
Rancieriean "**[dissensus]{.underline}**," as Zizekian
"truth--event/act," as Douzinasian
"**[resistance/insurrection]{.underline}**."30 The extraordinary is a
constant preoccupation, we see.

Yet, notwithstanding the philosophical investment in the event,
[life]{.underline}, when viewed through the lens of the heroic,
**[inevitably disappoints]{.underline}**. [The event]{.underline}, in
its materiality, [is **never quite as pure** as its philosophical
version]{.underline}, [**never quite enough** to transform]{.underline}
"[History]{.underline}" [**sufficient** for the philosopher's
satisfaction]{.underline};31 [moments of exalted extraordinary
emancipation **seemingly tire** into languid returns to **imperfection**
and **corruption**]{.underline}, **[domesticity]{.underline}**,
[even]{.underline} "**[failure]{.underline}**." Zizek, for example, is
quite clear:

\[W\]e should avoid the temptation simply to admire the sublime beauty
of uprisings that are doomed to fail.... What new positive order should
replace the old one, once the sublime enthusiasm of the uprising has
waned? It is here that we encounter the fatal weakness of the current
protests. They express an authentic rage that remains unable to
transform itself into even a minimal positive programme for
socio-political change. They express a spirit of revolt without
revolution.32

[If only people who struggle]{.underline}, erupt, and promise such
excitement to the philosopher [could be **truer to their
calling**]{.underline}, [possess **greater fidelity** to their evental
cause]{.underline}, [be **firmer** in their resolve to fulfil the
revolution]{.underline}. Still, [despite the **many inadequacies** and
**failures** of these uprisings]{.underline}, as Zizek judges them,
[the]{.underline} "**[radical emancipatory core]{.underline}**" of such
expressions of irruption [is **affirmed**]{.underline}.33 Indeed for the
Eurocentric "secular" philosopher, [this fidelity to the idea is a
matter of **philosophical salvation/damnation**]{.underline}. Without
the extraordinary resurrection of some mythologized subject birthed
through the extraordinary event, the post-Enlightenment philosopher of
(becoming-)being is left devoid,34 absent a cosmology of human beingness
that is able to withstand the abandonment of God, that makes such
"degodding" meaningful. And so [we witness]{.underline}: [a
**foundational ontology** of abandonment and resurrection
**informs**]{.underline} the **[philosophical]{.underline}**
"**[discoveries]{.underline}**" of critical post-Enlightenment
philosophers of the street.

#### That [reifies]{.underline} Eurocentric models of thought and [invisibilizes]{.underline} rich histories of everyday resistance that don't fit within their structural paradigm.

Unintended it might be, but [radical readings of

on prior constructions of human beingness based on a **colonial-modern
ontologic-epistemology**]{.underline} of being/nonbeing. For the

is that to]{.underline} "**[be]{.underline}**" [**outside** the
political is to be **abandoned to inexistence**]{.underline}, [whereby
the political has come to be the **ontological standard**
of]{.underline} a postdivine, secular normality of [human beingness
proper]{.underline}, a life desired, a life full; as such "inexistence"
([nonbeing]{.underline}) in political subjectivity is the underlying
abandonment that [defines the **condition** of the captured present that
**requires recovery** and **rescue**]{.underline}.35 [The recovery and
rescue of **Eurocentric philosophy**]{.underline}, that is, [the
ascription of extraordinary becoming to events of irruption
serves]{.underline} precisely, it appears to me, [to **enable** such a
rescue]{.underline}, [whereby the philosopher **assumes** that what is
witnessed]{.underline} in these instances [is the **extraordinary
ruptural assertion** of the idea]{.underline}, [of the
subject]{.underline}, [claiming a belonging in the
political]{.underline}, [out of absence]{.underline}, out of
inexistence, out of nothingness, [into]{.underline}
(extraordinary-)being, [a]{.underline} "[liberated]{.underline}"
[entity]{.underline}---[the subject]{.underline}---as the new in
history. Badiou, again, is illustrative: "We shall then say that a
change of world is real when an inexistent of the world starts to exist
in this same world with maximum intensity."36 The emergence of a new out
of inexistence is the heroic core of post-Enlightenment political--legal
philosophy.

A simple counteraffirmation serves as our point of departure for a
decolonial correction to "white ignorance."37 We can state it simply
thus: [**prior** to the **apparent extraordinary moment** which draws
the]{.underline} (critical) [philosopher's gaze to]{.underline} rest
upon the manifestations and expressions of [rebellious
life]{.underline}, [persists the **daily maneuvrings** of communities in
struggle in their encounters with the **totalizing desires** of
appropriative power]{.underline}. In this view, [what is witnessed
as]{.underline} the [extraordinary becoming]{.underline} of the new into
the world [is but the **material** and **exigent appearance** of
**persistent**]{.underline}, [if]{.underline} largely
"**[invisible]{.underline}**" [being]{.underline}(-otherwise) [whose
everyday is the **ordinary struggle** against extant orders]{.underline}
of asserted normalities. It is this that I here term
already-(other-)being that underpins a decolonial philosophy. And it is
[this presence]{.underline}, [and persistence that is **lost** to
critical Eurocentric philosophers of rupture]{.underline}; we see this,
for example, in the philosopher's apparent discovery of dissensus.

We observe the following: the critical philosopher's discoveries of
ruptural becomings is informed repeatedly, to use Santiago-Gomez's
phrase, of a "point-zero" perspective on human life worlds.38 By this is
meant a perspective whereby it is the "discovery" of the "other" (as
imagined) by the philosopher that begets the worlds of meaning from
whence history, as a projection of the idea, marches on. This we observe
is commonplace in much recent thinking and writing on resistance and
dissensus. For example, in concluding his analysis of the Tunisian
uprisings which marked the start of the so-called Arab Spring, Illan
Wall reflects thus:

In terms of strategies of resistance then, I want to underline the
importance of learning to live together without loyalty, without the
everyday presupposition that the state is naturally and inexorably
there. It is the interruption of everyday authority that is
crucial....this inoperativity is already there....Let me suggest then,
that the point of articulation between the critical legal theory of
dissensus and the Tunisian events is the question: how to unwork
sovereign power on an everyday basis, without reinstituting the same
logics once more?39

Wall's is a thoughtful, and respectful reading of resistance, rooted and
influenced by Jean-Luc Nancy's notion of "inoperativity"; indeed, he is
mindful not to "appropriate the politics of the "postcolony" and put it
to work for some "European" project."40 However, as with all Eurocentric
viewings of the worlds of "rupture/resistance," the point-zero
perspective is marked here. What I mean by this is that [the analysis
assumes a]{.underline} (**[dissensual]{.underline}**)
[moment]{.underline}, [an **event**]{.underline}, [from which the
extraordinary]{.underline} emergence/becoming of a [new is
discovered]{.underline}; [a perspective that identifies dissensus in
moments of]{.underline} "**[emergence]{.underline}**" [out of perceived
absence]{.underline} or inexistence after all is one which [assumes a
**prior**]{.underline} "**[consensus]{.underline}**," [a **normality**
from which]{.underline} then [the]{.underline}
"**[interruption]{.underline}**" [is]{.underline} thought to be
[witnessed]{.underline}. [From this **point zero**]{.underline}, then
[are]{.underline} "**[strategies of resistance]{.underline}**"
[postulated]{.underline}, [futures anticipated]{.underline}, [as a new
in the world]{.underline}.

But let us pause. [For **whom** this normality of consensus from which
dissensus is celebrated?]{.underline} From whose location of thought
this reading of the new of interruption? For whom, and from which moment
on, the novelty of this discovery? Even as Wall's account of the Ben Ali
regime is nuanced, [an assumption of a prior normality of the political
as a consensus **still persists**]{.underline} here. [A decolonial view
**instead**]{.underline}, I suggest, [begins precisely from a
**demystification** of that assumption of consensus and a recognition of
the **many undersides of persistent refusal** against such presumptions
of normality]{.underline}. I explain below.

Wall's view and [imagination suffers from a **common inability** of the
well-intentioned Eurocentric philosopher to see a different normality
when gazing upon the world]{.underline}, [to comprehend that
the]{.underline} "[interruptions of everyday authority]{.underline},"
[and the nonreification of the state]{.underline}, [are]{.underline}
perhaps, [for social majorities the **world over**]{.underline}, [the
**persistent**]{.underline} everyday unsentimental [**normalities** of
their ordinary being even as they **appear subservient**]{.underline};
[for them]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} "[importance of learning to
live together]{.underline} without loyalty, [without the everyday
presupposition that the state is naturally and inexorably
there]{.underline}" [may rather be better understood and realized than
assumed by the critical philosopher who **earnestly exhorts** such
rupture based on some]{.underline} discovery of the [extraordinary
event]{.underline}. Indeed, [such exuberance at **fixing** a meaning of
extraordinariness to the **eruptional manifestation** of persistent
refusals]{.underline}, however, "incompletely" as Wall claims to do,
[might]{.underline} well be to [**impoverish rather than enrich**
understandings of]{.underline} the extraordinariness of the normalities
of [resistance]{.underline}, [it might **continue invisibilizing** the
**rich tapestry of actually present consciousness** and
**experiences**]{.underline} of (already-)being [that refuse the
consensus of the present]{.underline} as assumed by the critical
post-Enlightenment philosopher. **[Let us be frank]{.underline}**.
[**Nothing is added** to the actualities or the materialities of life
and struggle by the **philosophical naming** of an eruption of anger or
refusal]{.underline} as event or dissensus, [neither are]{.underline}
extant [orderings of the political]{.underline} as bordered normalities
of governmentality **[challenged]{.underline}** by the invented duality
of consensus/dissensus; [**all** such ascriptions do is to attach to a
given time and place **particular abstracted categories** based on
**presumed universal truths**]{.underline} of beingness. [In doing
so]{.underline}, the pasts, presents, and infinite futures that define
[the materialities of life and struggle are]{.underline} conveniently
[**subsumed** under the **celebratory reification** of]{.underline} an
instant that is read as "evental," marking a progressive node in history
as promised by [the heroic mythology of the **European
Enlightenment**]{.underline}; in this, Wall does not escape from the
"appropriation" of the postcolony for the European project.

#### Vote negative for [critical unlearning]{.underline}---reject the 1AC as a [decolonial corrective]{.underline}. Before developing theories or tactics for resistance "[out there]{.underline}," we must interrogate the [necessity]{.underline} and [sufficiency]{.underline} of our actions "[in here]{.underline}."

**Nayar, 17**---associate professor and director of the International
Development Law and Human Rights LLM Program at the School of Law,
University of Warwick (Jayan, "Some Thoughts on the "(Extra)Ordinary":
Philosophy, Coloniality, and Being Otherwise," Alternatives: Global,
Local, Political, Vol 42, Issue 1, 2017, dml)

No wonder then that [critical philosophers]{.underline} of the street
[find themselves **constantly oscillating** between hope and
disappointment with every perceived evental occurring]{.underline},
"chasing after their own tails" as it were. But more than this, I
suggest, is that [such a philosophy does **precisely the opposite** of
rupturing the present]{.underline}; [in all its **bravado**]{.underline}
in proclaiming the next resurrection of history's mandate, [it is
**irrelevant** to the **actual workings** of coloniality which continues
**untouched** by the radical posturings of heroic
philosophers]{.underline}, as it is to the politics of dismay and
disavowal as witnessed by recent resurgences of nationalistic populisms
as well as to the manifold experiments with decolonial being that enrich
the geographies of being otherwise to Europe. We remember Franz Fanon's
advice from long ago, that humanity is better served by leaving behind
the idea of Europe, to abandon its precepts and promises: "where they
were never done talking of Man...today we know with what sufferings
humanity has paid for every one of their triumphs of mind."75 "Leaving
behind the idea of Europe": for this, [we must begin to learn from
**outside** and **beyond** the assumptions of the
categories]{.underline} of normality and exceptionality of human
beingness [that **underpin** European civilization]{.underline}.
Instead, [we might begin by **thinking**]{.underline}
"**[critically]{.underline}**" in the sense suggested by Hage (as he
considers the lessons of "critical anthropology") [to]{.underline}
"[**reflexively move outside** of ourselves such that we can start
seeing ourselves in ways we could not have possibly seen
ourselves]{.underline}, [our culture or our society
before]{.underline}."76 [Then might we understand that]{.underline},

[we can be **radically other** than what we are]{.underline}. Our
otherness is always dwelling within us: [there is **always more** to us
than we think]{.underline}, so to speak....Critical anthropology,
appropriately enough, is more akin to the shamanic act of inducing a
haunting: indeed it encourages us to feel haunted at every moment of our
lives by what we are/could be that we are not.77

The dual responsibility to be haunted by the radical other as
possibility and to serve as the shaman to induce such a haunting,
usefully describes the decolonial philosophical labor. [Rather than
seeking out life]{.underline} (in its extraordinariness) [to **conform**
to some **prefigured philosophical category**]{.underline} of
extraordinary subject becoming/being, [a decolonial perspective would
learn from]{.underline} the (extra)ordinary [experiences of
struggle]{.underline} of peoples [from which to **demythologize** the
ontologic-epistemologies of Europe as a colonial invention]{.underline}.
[**Two** simultaneous tasks are **urgent**]{.underline}, both pertaining
to a rupture of philosophy. **[Firstly]{.underline}**, [a dismantling of
the philosophical]{.underline} ([European]{.underline}) [**self** that
has]{.underline} hitherto [cast its defining gaze upon the
world]{.underline}, [so that we might **better**]{.underline} see and
[**sense** the haunting of the radical other upon
ourselves]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} following from this,
**[secondly]{.underline}**, [a dismantling of the **substantive
foundational categories** of post-Enlightenment philosophical
structures]{.underline}, and thus of the technologies of naming and
emplacing bordered subject beingness that normalize the coloniality of
power.

With respect the former, [we begin by **critical
self-cognition**]{.underline}. [We]{.underline}, philosophers of
rupture, [are **so easy** in our conjuring up of philosophical
engagements with the extraordinary]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}, [we
**think**]{.underline}, [the **role of the insurrectionary
intellectual**]{.underline}. [But this is a **deflection** of
the]{.underline} "**[critical question]{.underline}**" of what it means
to be human being. [The thinker thinks the world **out
there**]{.underline}, [**projecting** thoughts and imaginations for
liberated futures to an **external realm** of the]{.underline}
'**[problem]{.underline}**', [for a]{.underline}
'**[liberation]{.underline}**' [of the other]{.underline}. [Thus is the
event spoken of and]{.underline} the extraordinary [read in **certain
moments**]{.underline}, [thus are]{.underline} "**[epistemic
insurrections]{.underline}**" [and **strategies of resistance**
envisioned to transform the world]{.underline}, [while the **ordinary
moments** and the **locations** of the thinker in the world]{.underline}
-- [of the **existential implicatedness** of the]{.underline}
professional(ised) [philosopher]{.underline} of liberation -- [are
**excused** the urgency of liberation]{.underline}, [**absented** the
ontology of colonization and subjugation]{.underline}, [and **denied**
the embodiment of subjugation itself]{.underline}. Jose [Medina
exemplifies such a position]{.underline} of deflection:

[The **critical task** of the scholar and the activist is to **resurrect
subjugated knowledges**]{.underline} -- that is, to revive hidden or
forgotten bodies of experiences and memories -- [and to help **produce
insurrections** of subjugated knowledges]{.underline}.... Such
insurrections involve the difficult labor of mobilizing scattered,
marginalized publics and of tapping into the critical potential of their
dejected experiences and memories....those subjects by themselves may
not be able to destabilize the epistemic status quo until they are given
a voice at the epistemic table...78

These are noble intentions but how different this from the "critical
thinking" of Hage? The clear demarcation of an "us" and "them" in
Medina's "difficult labors" of insurrectionary thinking involves no
process of being "haunted" by they who are the other who require
rediscovery and salvation. [The]{.underline} "[scholar and the
activist]{.underline}" [appear **not subject** to the critical
insurrections envisaged]{.underline}; in this, [neither the]{.underline}
"**[self]{.underline}**" [nor the]{.underline}
"**[office]{.underline}**" [of the]{.underline} "**[critical
thinker]{.underline}**" **[factor]{.underline}** as being constituent of
the world [as worlds of resistance and liberation are thought and
proffered]{.underline}, [the thinker]{.underline}--thinking--liberation
[is the **one subject**]{.underline} in and of the world [that **figures
little** in critical theories]{.underline} of subjugation/liberation,
[whose everyday ordinary world does not confront the demands of
rupture]{.underline}. [Thinking the extraordinary **enables precisely
such deflection**]{.underline}.

[Instead]{.underline}, [we might **think critically
differently**]{.underline}: [to see coloniality as it is **imprinted
upon our worlds**]{.underline}, [to see ourselves
differently]{.underline}. Perhaps [we might then see that it is **us**
who are the ones **utterly colonized** even as we **pride ourselves**
with our endeavors of]{.underline} "[thinking]{.underline}"
[critically]{.underline}; [our radical outpourings being **just another
commodity** in a system of exchange where anything can be
so]{.underline}. Through this other view, [we might begin to learn
that]{.underline}, [the **world over**]{.underline}, [communities in
struggle]{.underline} within the social majorities, in their being
already and other, [do indeed live out]{.underline} "**[actual
revolutions]{.underline}**," **[before]{.underline}**,
**[through]{.underline}**, [and **after** the revolutions of
philosophers]{.underline}, theirs being lives nontransfixed to the
colonial--modern mythologies of the Enlightenment, their time not
defined by the before and after of abandonments by history and
resurrections of events, [even as the events of refusals]{.underline},
[celebrations]{.underline}, [resistance]{.underline}, [and
reaffirmations]{.underline}, when these so unpredictably occur, [are
significant expressions]{.underline} of their beingness. The stuff of
decolonial struggle, in this understanding, is precisely the work to be
otherwise in the face of the normalities of coloniality, and this indeed
is extraordinary. [The question is whether]{.underline}
"**[we]{.underline}**" [have the capacity]{.underline} so to be
decolonial nonsubjects, [to **ourselves rupture** from the normalities
that secures us our]{.underline} "**[places]{.underline}**" [in this
world of **rewards**]{.underline} ([and **punishments**]{.underline})
[and **care**?]{.underline} Can we, in other words, contemplate that
(extra)ordinary possibility of being ourselves otherwise? For [then
might we share in the struggle to imagine the substantive rupture of
coloniality]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} philosophical **[task for the]{.underline}**
"Europeanized"79 **[philosopher]{.underline}** becoming otherwise then
[would be to **dereify** the]{.underline} invention of the
[**foundational categories** of post-Enlightenment
ontologic--epistemology]{.underline}; [this includes]{.underline} such
sacraments as [sovereignty]{.underline}, [the subject]{.underline}, [the
political]{.underline}, [and with it]{.underline}, [the underlying
conception of a]{.underline} ([propertied-]{.underline})[self that
serves as the **ontological foundation** of]{.underline}
colonial--modern political--legal [philosophy]{.underline}. [The result
of such a correction might be that we neither seek to **reclaim some
lost humanity** from discredited]{.underline}
([Enlightenment]{.underline}) [institutions of the
**state**]{.underline} (as liberal "reformers" are inclined to do) [nor
to **reclaim some evental truth** of mythologized becomings that would
**transform**]{.underline}/return "political sovereignty" and
**[subjectivity]{.underline}** (as are the inclinations of so-called
radicals) [but rather to **dename the very assumed ontological
categories themselves**]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline} [**a lot
more** than a philosophical exercise]{.underline}. The rupture of
categories in [this]{.underline} way [entails the **material encounter**
with the structures of power]{.underline}, [of the state]{.underline},
[of the market]{.underline}, [of the purported subject]{.underline}, [in
order that what is understood as the givenness of human beingness is
**interrupted**]{.underline}. The point is this: [a **decolonial
correction** would **begin**]{.underline} the critical task of thinking
against "norm-ality" [by taking]{.underline}, [as the **philosophical
point of departure**]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} (extra)ordinary
**[refusals]{.underline}** of the "social majorities" [to be
subject]{.underline}. Thus, [the task of the critical philosopher is
**less** one to **educate them**]{.underline}, **[out
there]{.underline}**, [with our **insurrectionary wisdom** but
more]{.underline}, [**first** and **foremost**]{.underline}, [to
**enable an unlearning**]{.underline}, **[ours
included]{.underline}**.80 This is perhaps a somewhat more discomforting
a burden for the heroic philosopher than it is to pontificate upon the
ruptures of the street, but what better reason than this to think the
(extra)ordinary?

### Alt---2NC

#### The alt is [critical unlearning]{.underline}---vote negative on [presumption]{.underline}. This is a K of your capacity to render a decision for them---when evaluating whether they've met their burden of proving the 1AC was sufficient for a ballot, you should first ask yourself what voting for them would do that isn't happening in the status quo, and [critically examine]{.underline} your ability to answer that question and how you have [learned]{.underline} the knowledge that lets you do so. 

#### Reject the aff as a decolonial corrective. You should [presume]{.underline} against totalizing theories of power and resistance and in favor of assuming that resistance exists everywhere around us in forms that are [far more effective]{.underline} than anything you can do by casting an aff ballot. Refusing this framing, or voting aff despite it, posits the ballot as a uniquely emancipatory event which uniquely reifies domination by forwarding a totalizing, Eurocentric notion of resistance.

**Nayar, 17**---associate professor and director of the International
Development Law and Human Rights LLM Program at the School of Law,
University of Warwick (Jayan, "Some Thoughts on the "(Extra)Ordinary":
Philosophy, Coloniality, and Being Otherwise," Alternatives: Global,
Local, Political, Vol 42, Issue 1, 2017, dml)

We see, therefore, with Scott, that [it is not
**nothingness**]{.underline}, [nor **nonbeing**]{.underline}, [nor
**inexistence** in abject abandonment]{.underline}, [that defines
the]{.underline} "[excluded]{.underline}" when viewed through a
decolonial lens. Rather, [**prior** to]{.underline}, [and **concurrent**
with]{.underline}, [the colonizing and totalizing advent of the subject
are **already vibrant presences**]{.underline} in the world [that are
cosmologically rich and vital]{.underline}, [and various and
diverse]{.underline}. [Beingness]{.underline} in this sense **[remains
present]{.underline}**, [even in the face of colonizing
violence]{.underline}, both corporeal and philosophical,
[**invisibilized** and **silenced** perhaps]{.underline}, silent often,
[made **subaltern** no doubt]{.underline}, even self-doubting as it may
be, [yet **tenacious** in its perseverance and creativity]{.underline}.
Understood in this light, [it is less the heroic]{.underline},
[extraordinary advent of the resurrected subject than]{.underline} the
[ordinary resilience and creativity]{.underline} of (already-)being
[that defines decoloniality]{.underline}.46

But there is nothing exceptional, nothing out of the ordinary, that is
being described in these observations. [In **contrast** to thinking that
originates from]{.underline} ([Eurocentric]{.underline})
[exceptionalism]{.underline}, [this]{.underline} is a thinking which
[seeks **no**]{.underline} "**[historical moment]{.underline}**" to
beckon the extraordinariness of human fortitude and creativity [against
the desires of colonizing appropriation]{.underline}, either of bodies
or of minds. [Life]{.underline}, we learn, [is **simply not that
spectacular** in its infinite unfolding]{.underline}. History as a
philosophical idea and ideal of the "European Enlightenment" is not the
concern here; the decolonial philosopher is not so obsessed with
recovering such a faith. Rather, what is of concern is the everyday
resilience of struggle against coloniality, both material and
philosophical. As Gustavo Esteva and Madhu Suri Prakash remind us,

For the most part,...[the main actors]{.underline} of the unfolding epic
remain unknown to the world created by modern media; thereby still
protected or sheltered from the forces that co-opt, tempt, or seduce
those suddenly blinded by overnight fame and "front-page" limelight. In
many cases, people's reactions to the "Global Project" [have **not** yet
taken the shape of]{.underline} "[a **movement**]{.underline}": [they
have **not a specific name** or **label** with which they identify
themselves or are identified by others]{.underline}. [Their **informal
condition** as the unnamed and the unidentified is]{.underline} an
**[important]{.underline}** aspect of their politics, often [offering
them the **camouflage** essential to their survival]{.underline}; [as is
their]{.underline} "**[failure]{.underline}**" [to adopt
any]{.underline} "institutional **[structure]{.underline}**."47

Obviously, "**[they]{.underline}**" [**do surface** from time to
time]{.underline}, [unleashing their **anger**]{.underline}, [their
**refusal**]{.underline}, [their expression of being]{.underline}
(already and other) [**against** continued attempts to make them
compliantly subject]{.underline}; [the]{.underline}
"[subaltern]{.underline}" **[indeed does speak]{.underline}**, [even if
**otherwise** than the]{.underline} comprehensible [frames
of]{.underline} speech that make them audible to [**colonial
listeners**!]{.underline}48 This is to say that [it **really does not
matter** to the **actual worlds** of everyday resistance and
inoperativity whether or not philosophers]{.underline} of rupture
[**ascribe meaning** and **significance** to the infinite ways
of]{.underline} (already-)being that constitute [human
beingness]{.underline}. [Such is the **persistent truth** of the
ordinary]{.underline}: [the]{.underline}
"**[slave]{.underline}**"---[the **ontological nonsubject** that has
fixated many a critical thinker]{.underline}---[for all the
**philosophical negation** that purportedly constructs the nonbeingness
of slave]{.underline}, **[still]{.underline}**, as already being other
than slave, **[unceasingly rises up]{.underline}** against the "master";
[repeatedly and everywhere]{.underline}, thus are lived out the
extraordinariness of the ordinary truth wherein [the negated continue to
negate the negater!]{.underline} The following two declarations are
illustrative:

Our autonomy doesn't need permission from the government: it already
exists.49

What do we have to ask forgiveness for? What are they to "pardon"
us?...Who should ask for forgiveness and who can grant it?50

[Examples **abound** where the subjugated **refuses to be subsumed**
within the consensus]{.underline}, remembering and dreaming a life
otherwise; the "negro" articulates the radical power of "**[black
skins]{.underline}**"; the **[women]{.underline}** who were invisible
stand [at the forefront of a **march**]{.underline}; the indigenous
refuses to be decimated by "civilization" through the simple refusal
"**[Ya Basta]{.underline}**"; the "alien" affirms that "**[no one is
illegal]{.underline}**"; the economically superfluous and disposable
self-names "**[indignados]{.underline}**." All of [these are significant
not for any **evental becoming**]{.underline} into the world---[such
would be the heroic reading that **fixes** and]{.underline} thereby
**[perverts]{.underline}** the moments of the (extra)ordinary [in
**reified moments**]{.underline} of purported before and after---rather,
in that [they voice the extraordinariness of ordinary refusal and
affirmation of an ever-present being-otherwise]{.underline}. Ordinary
being in ways otherwise than prescribed and assigned by "sovereign"
assertions of authority and prescriptions of names and placements
already contain within them not the nothingness of inexistence or
nonbeing but the rich tapestry of existing social and philosophical
resources of being, of refusal, and of desubjectification, even as these
might largely be invisible, silent, and compliant.

None of this is new to philosophers less fixated with the extraordinary
promises of the European Enlightenment for the extraordinary subject of
history. Many have variously described the persistence of decolonial
refusal: Mignolo, as the material and psychosocial formations of "border
thinking";51 Chatterjee, as the maneuvrings and calculated negotiations
of life that define the "politics of the governed";52 Satrin, as the
revolutions of creativity and resilience in reclaiming horizontalidad
and autonomy by community and worker organizations;53 de Sousa Santos,
as the living pluriverse of the ecologies of knowledges and the
epistemologies of the south.54 [**Tempting** as it is to **focus** our
critical philosophical attention on **spectacular events**]{.underline}
([of **perceived rupture**]{.underline}), [the **everydayness** that
originates such]{.underline} visible and [public enactments]{.underline}
and enunciations, [and the **untamed consciousness** of
insubordination]{.underline}, disobedience, [and rebellion that
nourishes and informs these journeys of hope]{.underline}, [remind us
that the sovereign assertion of totality and normality are **less
successful**]{.underline} in constructing identities of
subject-beingness [than either the **masters**]{.underline} of the
universe [or **critical philosophers**]{.underline} of rupture [might
assume]{.underline}.

[Let me be **clear**]{.underline}. [This **distinction**]{.underline} I
am drawing between the notions of extraordinary evental rupture, on the
one hand, and the ordinariness of the extraordinary, on the other,
[would matter little if **all** that is at stake]{.underline} here [is a
matter of **philosophical wordplay**]{.underline}. I am suggesting,
**[however]{.underline}**, that [the distinction is **critical** to a
**decolonial correction** of the way we **read resistance** and
**envisage other possibilities** to the problem of the
present]{.underline}. The recognition and reintroduction of ordinary
already-being to philosophy return the extraordinary back to the
materiality of the everyday. Importantly, such [a **deprivileging** of
the **constitutive categories** of Eurocentrism returns attention to the
**invisibilized** and **silenced truths**]{.underline} ([of
consciousness and imagination]{.underline}) [that **define** the
persistence of struggles]{.underline} ([and of hope]{.underline}) [in
the everyday]{.underline}. It is here, in this everyday of the ordinary
materialities of living life, wherein the extraordinariness of
decoloniality resides.

### AT: Perm

#### The perm [fails]{.underline}. The alt isn't a decolonial correction of the [aff]{.underline}, but of [your own subconscious assumptions]{.underline} that [persuade]{.underline} you to determine that they have met their burden of proof. No part of our argument is compatible with an aff ballot because our K is a refusal of the [premise]{.underline} of voting aff itself!

by]{.underline} the communities of the "Zapatistas" (and [the **very
many actual communities** around the world that live their struggles for
life]{.underline}). Here, [we see the **essence** of the]{.underline}
"**[alternative geographies]{.underline}**" [of resistance]{.underline}
that Dabashi speaks of, of the ordinary that is the radical decolonial
rupture [rooted in the **materialities** of life]{.underline} (and
death) of embodied beings [as **opposed** to those of
**reified**]{.underline} (**[universal]{.underline}**)
[subjects]{.underline}:

[**rather** than]{.underline} dedicating ourselves to [training
**guerrillas**]{.underline}, **[soldiers]{.underline}**, [and
**squadrons**]{.underline}, [we developed **education** and **health
promoters**]{.underline}, [who went about building the foundations of
autonomy]{.underline} that today amaze the world.

Instead of constructing barracks, improving our weapons, building walls
and trenches, we built schools, hospitals and health centers; improving
our living conditions.

Instead of fighting for a place in the Pantheon of individualized deaths
of those from below, we chose to construct life.68

This is a concise articulation of the everyday of convivial and socially
rooted beings being in the world. [In these **everyday actions**
of]{.underline} "[choosing life]{.underline}" ([**not** in some
**beautiful future to come** but in the very uncertainties and struggles
in the **present**]{.underline}) at the same time [is expressed the
**most profound substance** of decoloniality]{.underline}; Subcomandante
Marcos continued, in his "final communique" to stress this, the
ordinary, its radicality rooted in the lives of the ordinary:

And [the **most important**]{.underline} \[[change]{.underline}\]: [the
change in **thinking**]{.underline}: [from **revolutionary vanguardism**
to]{.underline} "rule by obeying"; from taking Power Above to [the
creation of power **below**]{.underline}; from professional politics to
everyday politics; from the leaders to the people; from the
marginalisation of gender to the direct participation of women; from the
mocking of other to the celebration of difference....Personally, [I
**don't understand** why thinking people]{.underline} who affirm history
is made by the people [get **so frightened** in the face of an
**existing government** of the people where]{.underline}
"[specialists]{.underline}" [are **nowhere to be seen**]{.underline}.69

Thus is the extraordinary work of decoloniality in all its messy,
mundane materiality: to choose life over death, to regenerate
socialities and cultures of being, and to remember what human beingness
means and involves. And here lies the radicality of decolonial thinking
and being. [In these **already present struggles** of the social
majorities are]{.underline} ways of being-otherwise [the living
experiments of **actual rupture**]{.underline}, [**not** of **reified
philosophical categories** but of **material lifeworlds**]{.underline}.
As other to Zizek's actual political revolution, as an alter-politics
that ruptures the dispositive of colonial--modernity, the Zapatista's
experiments with choosing life correspond to what Eduardo Viveiros de
Castro described as the lifeworlds of "primitive societies" existing as
exterior to the state,

as the force of anti-production permanently haunting the productive
forces, and as the conceptual embodiments of the thesis that another
world is possible: that there is life beyond capitalism, as there is
society outside of the State.70

In such 'primitive societies' are the actual 'hard work' of creating new
forms of organisations (Zizek), and the daily manoeuvres of unworking
sovereign power (Wall), the normal and (extra)ordinary matters of
survival, solidarity and regeneration. What [this struggle involves in
the everyday]{.underline} is [the very material and existential matters
of]{.underline} eating, learning, healing, playing, dreaming, dancing,
even shitting, in other words, of **[living]{.underline}**, [in living
communities of solidarity and hope]{.underline}.71 Understood in this
light, [the work of a **decolonial correction** pertains to the
**refusal precisely to be subject** to]{.underline} what Wynter terms
the Eurocentric "descriptive statement" of the human---[the **very
ontological assumptions** of human beingness]{.underline}---[that
**informs**]{.underline} post-Enlightenment, **[colonial-modern subject
beingness]{.underline}**.72 To speak rupture in philosophy as particular
Events are named and heralded is no difficult task; it is quite
something else to insert the struggles to transform the material
conditions of coloniality, as they persist in the everyday, into
philosophical registers of "meanings." In this connection, [the
**philosophical work** of the decolonial pertains to the tasks of
**denaming** the normalities of beingness in the world as inscribed by
colonial philosophies]{.underline} of being-becoming.

[There is **little** here that might appear as **satisfactory** to the
gaze of the]{.underline} post-Enlightenment [**philosopher** concerned
with the heroic politics of rupture]{.underline}; the [material
organization]{.underline}, for example, of shitting---the "economies" of
shit as it were---after all [is **not quite as spectacular**
as]{.underline} the "politics" of [**riots** and **street
occupations**]{.underline}.73 And [yet]{.underline}, [this is
**precisely the necessary correction**]{.underline} in my view [that
might be **rightfully regarded** as]{.underline}
"**[decoloniality]{.underline}**"; [in the materiality of the ordinary
lies the extraordinary decolonial imagination and practical resilience
of communities who]{.underline}, [**regardless** of the **presumed
totality** of colonial philosophical-political construction]{.underline}
of (b)ordered subjectification past and present, built, and continue to
build "schools, hospitals, and health centers" to improve their living
conditions, "chose to construct life," outside of the embrace of
"biopolitical care," [**refused** to be what they were **assigned** to
be]{.underline} in spaces, both geographical and cosmophilosophical,
[remaining **otherwise** than ascribed and enforced]{.underline}. Simply
put, [this is how]{.underline}, [although largely **invisible** and in
the **margins**]{.underline}, [**actual revolutions** are
**lived**]{.underline}, [how]{.underline} "**[horizontal]{.underline}**"
[and **autonomous** lives are **regenerated** in ways that are resistant
and creative]{.underline}.74 [Once we understand this]{.underline}
(extra)ordinary wisdom of being-otherwise, [then we might **begin**
seeing]{.underline}, [and learning]{.underline},
**[ourselves]{.underline}**, [from the extraordinariness of ordinary
being that **define** the decolonial actualities of the world's social
majorities]{.underline}. The question then is what do we make of such a
realization as we philosophize rupture.

### Link---Anti-Blackness---Abstraction

#### Ideological abstracting Blackness [cedes]{.underline} political terrain to elites.

**Reed,** **21**---Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the
University of Pennsylvania (Adolph, interviewed by Jason Myles and
Pascal Robert, "Adolph Reed Jr. on race reductionism and liberational
politics," <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvYcl7xkD70>,
1:14:05-1:19:22, dml)

Well, **[there is no Black community]{.underline}**. I mean, not like
that. Not [that comes **fully formed** and **whole** with an interest
that can be **imputed** or that **overrides** all the **discrete
interests** that are at play]{.underline}. And I think this is one of
the problems with notions like Black freedom struggle and stuff like
that, that there's [a **lack of historical specificity**]{.underline}
that [leads]{.underline} the [radicals to posit the ideal constituency
at a level of **abstraction** that doesn't help you connect with
**actual people's actual concerns**]{.underline}.

And [this is]{.underline}, I think, perfectly [demonstrated in how
radicals moved]{.underline} from generic Black Power radicalism and the
warrants, like putting Black faces in previously all-white places and
Black economic development stuff, [to construct]{.underline} these three
different variants of what I would argue are [the same **ontological
fantasy**]{.underline}. That's why it's called an ideology.
Pan-Africanism, culturalism, and the scientific socialism
[that]{.underline} the new communists embraced.

Because in each case, the move was to withdraw from -- And there was a
comparable thing going on in SDS too, by the way, or coming out of SDS
-- But to [**withdraw** from the plane of **mundane struggle** where
people's lives were played out]{.underline}. To go into the closet,
basically, or the sanctuary, and develop [some **abstraction** called an
**ideology**]{.underline}, that in each case [was understood to
be]{.underline} like [an **internally consistent belief
system**]{.underline}. Like a religion, basically. That's what they all
were. And [the politics that was warranted]{.underline} from each of
these ideologies [was]{.underline} in some way
**[apocalyptic]{.underline}**. So, [when people]{.underline} used to
[talk about shit like when the revolution comes]{.underline}. Well, in
the first place, **[that's not the way stuff works]{.underline}**. And
granted, I was the last \[inaudible\] so what the hell, right, because
they weren't the only ones doing it.

So, what radicals saw was... We hit the streets like moonies, basically,
or Jehovah's Witnesses, or whoever the people are who go around and ring
your doorbell. And by the way, it used to work back in the day, a long
time ago, that when they rang your doorbell you'd just say, I'm
Catholic, and they'd run away like they'd just seen Satan. But that
apparently doesn't work anymore.

But anyway. So [what political action was considered to be was
**proselytizing the ideology**]{.underline}, [not trying to **organize
around concrete programs** and **undertakings** that would **make
people's lives better**]{.underline}. And that brings us back into the
thin and abstract character of the symbols of new radicalism. Like, you
knew that you were a Panther because you had that beret and that jacket.
You knew you were a Nationalist because you had the dashiki and a beard
like Maulana Karenga, and you knew you were Pan-Africanist because you
dressed like a loser.

But [none of those had any **concrete content**]{.underline}. I know it
felt like it to the radicals. The [radicals felt that all this stuff was
**deeply meaningful**]{.underline}. But only to congregants in the
church and to competitors from those other two churches. And again,
[bourgeois politicians]{.underline}, both the elected type and the war
on poverty type, or the rest of them, were able just to **[take
advantage]{.underline}** of that stuff [because they had an
**institutional program** to offer people]{.underline}.

So, I think, yeah. I think it's correct that the [radicals **weren't
able to overcome** the]{.underline} class character or the class
[forces]{.underline} that were [shaping Black politics]{.underline}, but
they weren't able to overcome it [because they **never engaged** with
it]{.underline}. [Because part of the deal was **denying their
existence**]{.underline}. And see, that's when you get constructs like,
or odd notions of what class meant. It had more to do with behavioral
and consumption preferences than with... And see, this takes back to the
notion of racial authenticity as the basis for politics. Right?

### Link---Anti-Blackness---Extinction

#### Disregarding the destruction of the planet is [antithetical]{.underline} to the purpose of radical Black scholarship.

**Moten and Kelley, 17**---professor of Performance Studies at New York
University AND Gary B. Nash Professor of American History at UCLA (Fred
and Robin D.G., "Robin D.G. Kelley & Fred Moten In Conversation,"
transcribed from <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP-2F9MXjRE>,
31:49-55:57, dml)

MOTEN: Well, first of all, I just want to say how much I appreciate
having a chance to be here with all of you tonight, and thank you,
Rinaldo, and, uh, Alicia, and Afua, of course. Robin, as always, uh, an
honor to be, have a chance to hang out with you, and uh, and to learn
from you, and um, let me see. Um, well, I tend to think of [Black
studies]{.underline} not so much as an academic discipline or confluence
of disciplines but as the atmosphere in which I grew up, and so, and I
love that, that atmosphere. I love the way that it felt, and I love the
way that it smelled, and I love the flavors, and I love the sounds, and
I love the movements. Um, and so, it is, again, something that I think
[has a **certain place**]{.underline}, maybe, **[in the
university]{.underline}**, and what it meant, what it has meant for
Black studies to take that place in the university has had both, has
been both good and bad. I think [it's probably done much more for the
university than it has for Black studies]{.underline}, and, and that's
something worth thinking about. And [I **don't say that because I'm
trying to advocate some withdrawal from the university of Black
studies**, but]{.underline} I'm thinking that, you know, that [at this
stage of the game in having done the work of attempting to]{.underline}
actually **[bring]{.underline}**, um, **[the university
into]{.underline}** some sense of its own, of what ought to be [**its
own intellectual mission**, Black studies has the right to **look out
for itself now**]{.underline}, for a little bit, um, and I think it's
worth it to do that. [And insofar as Black studies has earned a right to
look out for itself, what that really means]{.underline}, I think, [is
that Black studies has earned the right to try again to take its
**fundamental responsibility**, which is to be]{.underline}, uh, [a
place where we can **look out for the Earth**]{.underline}. Um, I think
that [Black studies has a **fundamental** and **specific**, though **not
necessarily exclusive mission**, and that mission is to **try to save
the Earth**, or at least]{.underline} to try to save, not, well, [on the
**most fundamental level** to **save the Earth**, and on a secondary
level, to try to **save the possibility of human existence on the
Earth**]{.underline}. Um, and I know that's a big statement, and I don't
wanna take up all the time, but I'm happy to try to say more about what
I think I mean by that later on, but, um, but I think maybe it's
important just to leave that big statement out there for a minute, and
just to make sure that you know that I knew that I said it when I said
it.

KELLEY: Okay, well, actually I wanna echo, uh, Fred's sentiments, that
it's really an honor to be here, in this space. Um, this is the second
time that we've had kind of a public conversation, and it's always
packed, you know, and it's always a lot of people, and expectations are
always high, and one of my favorite things on the planet, besides just
talking to my daughters, talking to Fred Moten, um, you know, and it's
just really, you know, I learn so much from it, and in fact, let me just
begin by saying that one of the pieces that Rinaldo was referring to was
an essay I wrote called, uh, "Black Study, Black Struggle," which was
entirely inspired by, uh, Fred Moten and Stefano Harney's, uh, book,
"The Undercommons." It was a way of the application of the notion of the
undercommons to understanding what was happening at that moment, which
in, in the fall of 2015, there was like an explosion of, um, Black
protests on, on campus, and, you know, I won't repeat what's in the
article, uh, but it, it's not an accident that some of those struggles,
uh, were products of what was happening in the streets. In other words,
what happened in Ferguson, and what happened in Baltimore, what happened
all over the country, and what happened in places like here in Toronto,
were the catalyst for, um, a kind of explosion on campuses, where, uh,
students were trying to figure out their place in the university.
They're dealing with racism, and microaggressions on university
campuses, uh, they're dealing with a, a kind of deracinated, you know,
curriculum where ethnic studies wasn't what it was, in its inception.
Um, and, I was also dealing with, or [many of us were]{.underline} also
[dealing with]{.underline}, uh, a culture of, and I hate to put it this
way, but [a **culture of anti-intellectualism**]{.underline} in, in a
different sort of way. I mean, [universities are often
anti-intellectual, in that they]{.underline} actually [**disavow certain
forms of knowledge** and put other knowledge above that]{.underline},
which is an anti-intellectual position by the way. Um, [but then when
you're assaulted by that all the time]{.underline}, uh, [sometimes you
end up **mirroring that culture**. And you're saying "well I'm not gonna
read this, I'm not gonna read that, because so-and-so wrote it," as
opposed to saying that there's **nothing off the table**]{.underline},
uh, [that Black studies]{.underline}, and Fred knows this 'cause he
repeats it more than I do, that our mutual, uh, teacher, Cedric
Robinson, who paraphrased C. L. R. James, said you know, Black studies
[is a **critique of Western civilization**, and if that is the case,
then we **both** have to **dismantle it**, **recognize the weak
edifice** upon which it's built, but also **know everything that's
happening within it**]{.underline}. But anyway, let me just back up, um,
so, I just, so the three points I wanna make in reference to the
question, one is that, uh, social movements have always been the
catalyst for Black studies. When Fred was talking about, you know, Black
studies as, as, uh, kinda, kinda like a way of life, as an atmosphere in
which he grew up and which I grew up and many of us grew up, that's so
true. I never thought about it that way, but, you know, that's so true.
And in fact, um, if anything, Black Studies is not a multidiscipline but
a project, a project for liberation, whatever that means, and
[liberation is an **ongoing project**]{.underline}. Um, Ruthie Gilmore,
uh, who was at USC, uh, with me and Fred, had come up with this idea of
renaming ethnic studies "liberation studies." And, you know, we were
actually serious about that, we were like, trying to figure out how to
do that, and never filled it, but [it reminds us that]{.underline}, you
know, it's not about, um, [it's **not about a body**. It's **not about
bodies**. It's about **ideas**, and about the **future**]{.underline},
you know. [It's about **recognizing the past** and the **construction of
a new future**]{.underline}. And so I think, in that respect, in order
to understand the future of Black studies, we gotta understand the
movements that produced it---that, that the Movement for Black Lives,
that, um, uh, We Charge Genocide, that Black Youth Projects 100---all
these struggles that erupted have, in fact, uh, pointed the way for
Black Studies. The problem is, is that what gets constituted as the
institutional space of Black studies, in many cases, isn't really that.
And I hate to bring people down, because we're supposed to be up, right?
But there are a lot of departments that I wouldn\'t call Black studies
departments that have that name, you know, there are a lot of, [there\'s
a lot of scholarship that goes on that has **no relationship at all** to
the **project of transformation**, or to **people**, to **actual people
in community**]{.underline}. And one of the important things to always
remember is that, um, we wouldn\'t have Black studies if it wasn\'t---in
the United States, that is, I\'m talking about the US---if it wasn\'t
for Watts, if it wasn\'t for Detroit in 67, and if it wasn\'t for those
kinds of urban rebellions, if it wasn\'t for the struggles in the South,
that\'s where [Black studies]{.underline} comes from. Uh, and so it
[moves into the university]{.underline} as a, [as a **transformative
project**]{.underline}. Um, it\'s not---[and that\'s why]{.underline} I
think [there was a **disconnect** between]{.underline} some of the, the
[protests and what was happening in the academy]{.underline}. Finally,
there's this question of, of ethnic studies versus, or against, or for,
or within or bedded in Black studies. And one of the things that, that I
think a lot of us are trying to figure out is to deepen the relationship
between indigenous studies and Black studies. Um, to understand that
this was what I call second wave ethnic studies in the 1990s was itself
a project that was, believe it or not, in a, a response to
neoliberalism. And I think we don\'t always see that because we, we tend
to read backwards in the 1990s and 1980s as, like, ethnic studies as
identity politics in the narrowest sense of the word, that somehow this
was about producing a sense of, of pride and a sense of identity devoid
of the question of power. But if you actually look at the struggles for
ethnic studies in the 80s and 90s, it was all about power. That, that
what we think of as comparative or critical ethnic studies was, wasn\'t
about the celebration of difference. It wasn\'t liberal
multiculturalism. It was an assault on a neoliberal turn. And we, we
sometimes forget that and, and, and then we write the history. And so I
think I want to at some point talk more about that, but I think that\'s
something to remember, because, right now, [if we don\'t have Black
studies as a **critique in response to the neoliberal neofascist turn**,
then it\'s]{.underline} sort of **[worthless]{.underline}**. You know,
[it\'s going to continue to exist. Maybe not in the academy
though]{.underline}. So I\'ll just stop there.

WALCOTT: So, um, Robin, where you ended, and, and where Fred began, it's
a, is a good segue into getting you, both of you, to talk about the work
that you\'ve been doing around questions of Palestinian struggle and
freedom. Fred, the work that, the tremendous work that you did in the
ASA, um, American Studies Association, for which the Association is
still living true, and, and Robin the work that you continue to do with
um, um, with faculty for Palestine. But I\'m thinking about Fred\'s
provocation here that Black studies about saving the Earth and if Black
studies is indeed about saving the Earth, which I\'m very willing to
fall right into right now, you know, first to kind of maybe think about
this relationship between the struggle and, and freedom of Palestine and
the relationship between ongoing settler colonialisms globally, because
it seems to me that one of the most powerful things that, um, the kind
of Black studies that has taken to the streets recently has done is to
make those kinds of concerns present, right? BLM visits to Palestine,
BLM in Toronto, always making sure that the invocation of the politics
of settler colonialism is a part of a political organizing, and, um,
their intimate relations with indigenous communities. So maybe this is a
way for us to begin to talk about what\'s really at stake in this
contemporary political moment where, um, or, or a radical politics, a
politics that wants to think a different kind of future formation, is
grappling with, um, settler colonialism in various kinds of ways. But
Palestine being central to that, given that we know as we sit in this
university is that often, um, what we call our senior administrators
have an entirely different relationship with the question of freedom for
Palestine.

MOTEN: Well, um, first, I mean, the work I did around, um, you know, the
ASA's, um, you know, decision to endorse the academic and cultural
boycott of Israel was really minimal and minor compared to a lot of
other people who were really out front, um, and, and have been working
tirelessly for that for many, many years. Um, and I think, you know,
the, my contribution was more, you know, rhetorical in many ways in, in,
in, and, and maybe, maybe theoretical only in the most minimal sense, in
the sense that what I wanted to do was a couple of things. First, to
recognize that, um, you know, let\'s say that [the conditions of what
people call **modernity**]{.underline}, um, in, in, in, in, or global
modernity, that [the **fundamental conditions** that make that up
are]{.underline}, you know, [**settler colonialism**. And]{.underline} I
think [we can talk about settler colonialism in ways that are
**broader** than the normal way that we usually think of them as a **set
of violent** and **brutal relations** between Europe and the rest of the
world]{.underline}. Because I think it\'s really important. And, and,
and again, our, our mutual friend and mentor Cedric Robinson, pointed
this out emphatically, and in brilliant ways early on, that settler
colonialism is also an intra-European affair. Um, and it\'s important to
understand that. It\'s important to understand this historic
relationship between settler colonialism in the enclosure of the
commons, um, which is part and, part of the origins of, of what we now
know or understand as capitalism. But if we understand that [**settler
colonialism**, that the **transatlantic slave trade**]{.underline}, um,
[and]{.underline} that, you know, [the emergence of a **set of
philosophical formulations**]{.underline} that [essentially provide for
us **some modern conception of self** that has as its basis a kind of
**possessive**, **heteronormative**, **patriarchal individuation**,
right? That\'s **what it is to be yourself** on the **most fundamental
level**]{.underline}. You know, and if you ask anybody in the philosophy
department, they\'ll tell you that that\'s true, you know, and they
won't be joking, right, that, um, that, these, that these constitute the
basis of, of our modernity. But for most of the people who live in the
world, actually [for **everybody who lives in the world**, although most
of the people in live in the world are actually able to both recognize
this and say this, that modernity is a **social** and **ecological
disaster** that we live, that we now **attempt to
survive**]{.underline}. Okay? And if we take that up, then [part of
what\'s at stake is that we recognize that **feminist** and **queer
interventions against heteronormative patriarchy**, that **Black
interventions against the theory** and **practice of slavery**, which is
**ongoing**, that **indigenous interventions against settler
colonialism** constitute the general both **practical** and
**intellectual basis** for not only our **attempts to survive**, but
also our attempts to]{.underline}, as I said before, [**save the
Earth**.]{.underline} And, and I put it in terms that the great poet Ed
Roberson puts it; [**not just to save the Earth**, but to **see the
Earth before the end of the world**]{.underline}. And [this is an
**emergency** that we\'re in **now** and it\'s **urgent**]{.underline}.
Um, and I believe that [there's a **specific convergence** of black
thought and indigenous thought that situates itself **precisely in
relation to**, and is **articulated through**, the **interventions of
queer thought** and **feminist thought** that we want to take
up]{.underline}. And, and it, and it strikes me as, for me at least,
it\'s, it\'s a way of taking up a kind an---it\'s, [it's a way of
imagining]{.underline} how one might be able to, [how we might be able
to **walk more lightly on the Earth**. To **honor the Earth** as we walk
on it, as we stand on it. To **not stomp on it**, to **not stomp all
over it**, where **every step you take is a claim of
ownership**]{.underline}. And, and this is one way to put it, would be
to not so presumptuously imagine that the Earth can be reduced to
something so paltry and so viciously understood as what we usually call
home. This is part of the reason why the queer and the feminist critique
is so important. It\'s a critique of a general problematic notion of
domesticity. [It\'s like **another way of being on the Earth** that
**doesn\'t allow you** in some **vicious** and **brutal way** to claim
that it is yours]{.underline}, right? Um, this is important and this is
so, you know, often the methods that we use to claim the Earth as ours
involved fences, borders. This manifests itself on a private level from
household to household, but it also manifests itself on a national
level, and at the level of the nation state, and it\'s not an accident
that settler colonial states take it upon themselves to imagine
themselves to be the living embodiment of the legitimacy of the nation
state as a political and social form. For me, there\'s two reasons to be
in solidarity with the people of Palestine. One is because they\'re
human beings and they\'re being treated with absolute brutality, but the
other is that there\'s a specific resistance to Israel as a nation
state. And for my money, to be perfectly clear about this, I believe
that this nation state of Israel is itself an artifact of antisemitism.
If we thought about Israel and Zionism, not just as a form of racism
that results in the displacement of Palestinians, but if we also think
about them as artifacts of the historic displacement of Jews from
Europe, right, in the same way that we might think of, let\'s say Sierra
Leone or Liberia as artifacts of racist displacement, okay. If we think
about it that way, okay, and another, and the reason I\'m saying this is
just to make sure that you know that there\'s a possible argument
against the formulation that criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic when we
know that Donald Trump is a staunch supporter, that people like Pat
Robertson in the United States are staunch supporters that help us to
the fact that you can be deeply anti-Semitic and support the state of
Israel. These things go together. They\'re not antithetical to one
another. So that it becomes important for us to be able to suggest that
resistance to the state of Israel is also resistance to the idea of the
legitimacy of the nation state. It\'s not an accident that Israel has
taken upon itself, that when Israel takes upon itself, when the defense
of Israel manifests itself as a defense of its right to exist, this is
important. It\'s a defense, not just of Israel\'s right to exist, but of
the nation state as a political form's right to exist. And nation states
don\'t have rights. What they\'re supposed to be are mechanisms to
protect the rights of the people who live in them, and that has almost
never been the case, and to the extent that they do protect the rights
of the people who live in them, it\'s in the expense, it\'s at the
expense of the people who don\'t, okay. So part of what\'s at stake, one
of the reasons why it\'s at, it\'s important to pay particular attention
to this issue, why we ought to resist the ridiculous formulation that
singling out Israel at this moment is itself anti-Semitic is because
it\'s important to recognize that Israel is the state. \[KELLEY:
Right.\] MOTEN: For reasons that I think are totally bound up with
antisemitism, right? Israel is the state that, insofar as it makes the
claim about its right to exist, is also making the claim about the
nation state's right to exist as such. It\'s this, it\'s that same kind
of argument that, I remembered the---and I\'m sorry to keep going on so
long, but there\'s---there\'s those formulations that people often make
about Black people in it or indigenous people as if they were the
essence of the human, right, so that every time Black people or
indigenous people do something that supposedly we\'re not supposed to
do, it constitutes a violation to the very idea of the human. Right,
because somehow as a function of the nobility of our suffering, we
constitute the very idea of humanity, right? And there\'s nothing more
brutal, right? Nothing more vicious than having been being consigned to
that position. Similarly, Israel as a function of anti-Semitism has now
been placed in the position of protecting the very idea of the nation
state. So for me, first and foremost, it\'s important to have solidarity
with the Palestinian people, but second of all, it\'s important to
actually have some solidarity with the Jewish people insofar as they can
and must be separated from the Israeli state because ultimately the fate
of the Jewish people, if it is tied to this, to the nation state of
Israel, will be more brutal than anything that has yet been done or can
be imagined, and I mean everything that you think I mean when I say
that.

transcribed from <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP-2F9MXjRE>,

KELLEY: Um, Fred---Fred will take most of these questions. So that\'s
why I\'m going to begin first because he\'s gonna, he\'s gonna---he\'s
gonna end it because he, he, he has the answer to all these questions
'cause I turn to him for these questions. On the specific, on the first
question, I just want to make sure I understand it because I\'m, you
know, I don\'t always recognize, uh, it may be because I\'m just old,
but [I don\'t always recognize]{.underline}, uh, [that black
politics]{.underline}, black \[unclear---maybe "guys"\] work politics
[have been **structured** or **defined** by white
supremacy]{.underline}. I mean, white supremacy is there. And I guess
maybe because I\'m such a student of Cedric Robinson, you know, [[**not
everything is about**, or **in response to**, white
supremacy]{.underline}]{.mark}. And in fact, one of the critiques coming
out of doing Southern history was this idea that race relations
framework, that race relations defines, uh, African-American history or
Black history. And [it\'s **simply not true** because much of what
people do in terms of]{.underline}, of [**[social formation]{.mark}**,
**community building**]{.underline}, um, is, is, is what Raymond
Williams might call alternative cultures. In other words, it [[may be
**structured in dominance**]{.mark} in some ways, [but **not defined
by**]{.mark} **it**]{.underline}. And [Cedric]{.underline}\'s Black
Marxism, you know, really made this point. He [talks about the
**ontological totality**]{.underline}, you know, the, this sense of
being and making ourselves whole, in that we come out of an experience,
again, structured by white supremacy, structured by violence,
[**structured by enslavement** and **dispossession**]{.underline}, but,
[but one in which **western hegemony didn\'t work**]{.underline}, you
know, that modes of thinking wasn\'t defined by Enlightenment modes of
thinking. In other words, that, that [[part of]{.mark} the [Black
radical tradition is]{.mark} a [**refusal to be property**, to
**even**]{.mark} **[admit]{.mark} that [human beings could be
property]{.mark}**]{.underline}. You know, so [we sometimes [give
white]{.mark} [supremacy]{.mark} **way [too much
credit]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and maybe I misunderstood the question.
And so I think that there\'s lots of things that happen outside of joy
and survival, and survival is important, but survival is not the end
all, you know. So I think, and I\'ll give you one very, very specific
example, and now I\'m not gonna say anything else after this. [The way
we have tended to more recently [treat **slavery**, **Jim Crow** and
**mass incarceration**]{.mark}]{.underline} as a piece, [[as]{.mark} the
**reinstantiation of [the same thing]{.mark}**, the **continuation**,
that **[denies]{.mark} the fact** [that these systems are]{.mark}
**actually [distinct]{.mark}**, that they are [**historically
specific**, and]{.mark} in fact they're
**[responses]{.mark}**]{.underline} to, in many ways, [[to]{.mark} [the
**weakness** of]{.mark} this as [a racial regime]{.mark}]{.underline}.
So if you think of like the whole idea of the new Jim Crow to me is
very, very problematic. Um, although that book by Michelle Alexander is
very, very powerful and very useful in terms of educating people about
prisons. [Jim Crow was **not the continuation of slavery**]{.underline}.
It was not. [[Jim Crow was a **response to**]{.mark} **[the Black
Democratic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, uh, [[**upsurge** after
slavery]{.underline}]{.mark}. It was a revolution of Reconstruction. [It
was a way to try to suppress that]{.underline}. The fact that, that, you
know, there was this incredible response. [That\'s why]{.underline}
there\'s a, [there\'s [a **huge gap** between]{.mark} 1877 at
[the]{.mark} official [end of Reconstruction and]{.mark} the [rise of
Jim Crow]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is [the 1890s, disfranchisement,
lynching]{.underline}. That\'s because [you\'ve had **13**, **14**,
**15**, **20**, [**25 years** of]{.mark} a [**democratic possibility**
and **struggle**]{.mark}. The **[same]{.mark} thing [with mass
incarceration]{.mark}**---yes, we\'ve had incarceration,
but]{.underline} it\'s, but that, that, that, [that **[upward
swing]{.mark}** has a lot to do [with]{.mark}, again, [**responses**
to]{.mark} the struggles in [the]{.mark} 19[60s]{.mark}]{.underline},
the assault on the Keynesian welfare-warfare state, the fact that you
know the, the war on political, the formation of political prisoners,
those struggles in fact was the state\'s response to opposition. And so
[[if we **don\'t acknowledge that**]{.underline}]{.mark}, then [what [we
end up]{.mark} doing is [thinking]{.mark} that somehow there\'s a
structure of [white supremacy that\'s **unchanging**, **fixed**, and
**so powerful we can\'t do anything**]{.mark} **about it** when in fact
it\'s the **opposite**. [White supremacy is **fragile**]{.mark}. White
supremacy is **[weak]{.mark}**. [Racial regimes]{.mark} actually are
**[always]{.mark} having to [shore themselves up]{.mark}** precisely
[because they\'re **unstable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We can see that.
[We **can\'t see it** because the whole [system]{.mark}]{.underline} of
hegemony [is to [give]{.mark} us [the impression]{.mark} that [it is
**so powerful**]{.mark}, there\'s **no space out**. And [yet it's
**working overtime**]{.mark}]{.underline} to, [[to **respond to our
opposition**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Right. That may not answer your
question, but that\'s sort of a way I think about it. Maybe it's not
satisfactory, but yeah.

### Link---Anti-Blackness---Mbembe

#### The aff [mythologizes whiteness]{.underline}, which denies the history of Black radical activism in favor of violent reactionary tendencies. This replicates anti-Black violence and shuts down communal existence. 

**Mbembe 15.** Achille Mbembe, "Achille Mbembe on The State of South
African Political Life," Africa As A Country, September 19, 2015,
http://africasacountry.com/2015/09/achille-mbembe-on-the-state-of-south-african-politics/

[The old politics of waiting is therefore gradually replaced by a new
politics of **impatience** and, if necessary, of
**disruption**]{.underline}. [Brashness, disruption and a
new anti-decorum ethos are meant to bring down the pretence of normality
and the logics of normalization in this most "abnormal"
society]{.underline}.  **[Steve Biko, Frantz Fanon and a plethora of
black feminist, queer, postcolonial, decolonial and critical race
theorists are being reloaded in the service of a new form of militancy
less accommodationist and more trenchant both in form and
content]{.underline}**.

The age of impatience is an age when a lot is said -- all sorts of
things we had hardly heard about during the last twenty years; some
ugly, outrageous, toxic things, including calls for murder, atrocious
things that speak to everything except to the project of freedom, in
this age of fantasy and hysteria, when the gap between psychic realities
and actual material realities has never been so wide, and the digital
world only serves as an amplifier of every single moment, event and
accident.

[The **age of urgency** is]{.underline} also [an age when new wounded
bodies erupt and undertake to actually occupy spaces they used to simply
haunt]{.underline}. [They are now piling up, swearing and cursing,
speaking with excrements, **asking to be heard**.]{.underline}

[They speak in **allegories and analogies** -- the "colony", the
"plantation", the "house Negro", the "field Negro", blurring all
boundaries, embracing confusion, mixing times and spaces, at the risk of
anachronism]{.underline}.

[They are claiming all kinds of rights -- the right to violence; the
right to disrupt and jam that which is parading as normal; the right to
insult, intimidate and bully those who do not agree with them; the right
to be angry, enraged; the right to go to war in the hope of recovering
what was lost through conquest; the right to hate, to wreak vengeance,
to smash something, it doesn't matter what, **as long as it looks
"white".**]{.underline}

[All these new "rights" are supposed to achieve one thing we are told
the 1994 "peaceful settlement" did not achieve -- decolonization and
retributive justice, the only way to restore a  modicum of dignity to
victims of the injuries of yesterday and today.]{.underline}

Demythologizing whiteness

And yet, [some hard questions must be asked]{.underline}.

**[Why are we invested in turning whiteness, pain and suffering into
such erotogenic objects]{.underline}**?

[Could it be that the **concentration of our libido on whiteness**,
**pain** and **suffering** is after all typical of **the narcissistic
investments so privileged by this neoliberal age**?]{.underline}

[To frame the issues in these terms does not mean embracing a position
of moral relativism]{.underline}. How could it be? After all, [in
relation to our history, too many lives were destroyed in the name of
whiteness]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the structural repetition of past
sufferings in the present is beyond any reasonable doubt.  Whiteness as
a necrophiliac power structure and a primary shaper of a global system
of unequal redistribution of life chances will not die a natural
death]{.underline}.

**[But to properly engineer its death -- and thus the end of the
nightmare it has been for a large portion of the humanity -- we urgently
need to demythologize it]{.underline}**.

[If we fail to properly demythologize whiteness, whiteness -- as the
machine in which a huge portion of the humanity has become entangled in
spite of itself -- **will end up claiming us**]{.underline}.

[As a result of whiteness having claimed us; as a result of having let
ourselves be possessed by it in the manner of an evil spirit, we will
**inflict upon ourselves injuries of which whiteness**, at its most
ferocious, would **scarcely have been capable**]{.underline}.

Indeed [for whiteness to properly operate as the destructive force it is
in the material sphere, it **needs to capture its victim's imagination**
and turn it into **a poison well of hatred**]{.underline}.

[For victims of white racism to hold on to the things that truly matter,
they must incessantly fight against the kind of hatred which never fails
to destroy]{.underline}, in the first instance, [the man or woman who
**hates** while **leaving the structure of whiteness itself
intact**.]{.underline}

[As a poisonous fiction that passes for a fact, whiteness seeks to
institutionalize itself as an event by any means necessary. This it does
by colonizing the entire realms of desire and of the
imagination.]{.underline}

[To demythologize whiteness, it will not be enough to force "bad whites"
into silence or into confessing guilt and/or complicity. **This is too
cheap**]{.underline}.

[To **puncture** and **deflate** the fictions of whiteness will require
**an entirely different regime of desire**, new approaches in the
constitution of material, aesthetic and symbolic capital, another
discourse on value, on what matters and why]{.underline}.

The demythologization of whiteness also requires that we develop a more
complex understanding of South African versions of whiteness here and
now.

This is the only country on Earth in which a revolution took place which
resulted in not one single former oppressor losing anything. In order to
keep its privileges intact in the post-1994 era, South African whiteness
has sought to intensify its capacity to invest in what we should call
the resources of the offshore.  It has attempted to fence itself off, to
re-maximize its privileges through self-enclaving and the logics of
privatization.  These logics of offshoring and self-enclaving are
typical of this neoliberal age.

The unfolding new/old trial of whiteness won't produce much if whites
are forced into a position in which the only thing they are ever allowed
to say in our public sphere is: "Look, I am so sorry". 

**[It won't produce much if through our actions and modes of thinking,
we end up forcing back into the white ghetto those whites who have spent
most of their lives trying to fight against the dominant versions of
whiteness we so abhor]{.underline}**.

Furthermore, we must take seriously the fact that "**[to be black" in
South Africa now is not exactly the same as "to be black" in Europe or
in the Americas]{.underline}**.

After all, we are the majority here. Of course to be a majority is a bit
more than the simple expression of numbers. But surely something has to
be made out of this sheer weight of numbers. We can use this numerical
force to create different dominant standards by which our society live;
paradigms of what truly matters and why; entirely new social forms; new
imaginaries of interior life and the life of the mind.

We are also in control of arguably the most powerful State on the
African Continent. This is a State that wields enormous financial and
economic power. In theory, not much prevents it from redirecting the
flows of wealth in its hands in entirely new trajectories. As it has
been done in places such as Malaysia or Singapore, something has to be
made out of this sheer amount of wealth -- something more creative and
more decisive than our hapless "black economic empowerment" schemes the
main function of which is to sustain the lifestyles of the new élite.

The neurotic misery of our age

Finally, [it is crucial for us to understand that we are a bit more than
just "suffering subjects]{.underline}". "**[Social death" is not the
defining feature of our history]{.underline}**. [The fact is that we are
still here -- of course at a very high price and most likely in a
terrible state, but we are here.]{.underline}

[We are here -- and hopefully we will be here for a very long time --
not as anybody else's creation, but **as our
own-creation**]{.underline}.

**[To demythologize whiteness is to dry up the mythic, symbolic and
immaterial resources without which it can no longer dabble in
self-righteousness or in the morbid delight with which, as James Baldwin
put it, it contemplates "the extent and power of its own wickedness." It
is to not be put in a position in which we die hating somebody
else]{.underline}**.

On the other hand, **[politicizing pain is not the same thing as
advocating dolorism]{.underline}**. In fact, [it must be **galling** to
put ourselves in a position such that those who look at us cannot but
**pity us victims**]{.underline}.

[One way of **destroying white racism** is to prevent whiteness from
becoming a **deep fantasmatic object of our unconscious**]{.underline}.

[We need to **let go off our libidinal investments in whiteness** if we
are to squarely confront the dilemmas of white privilege. Baldwin
understood this better than any other thinker. "In order really to hate
white people]{.underline}", he wrote, "**[one has to blot so much out of
the mind -- and the heart -- that this hatred itself becomes an
exhausting and self-destructive pose]{.underline}**" (Notes of a Native
Son, 112).

This is what we have to find out for ourselves -- in a black majority
country in which blacks are in power, what is the cost of our attachment
to whiteness, this mirror object of our fear and our envy, our hate and
our attraction, our repulsion and our aspirations?

Part of what racism has always tried to do is to damage its victims'
capacity to help themselves. For instance, [racism has **encouraged its
victims to perceive themselves as powerless**]{.underline}, that is, [as
victims even when they were actively engaged in myriad acts of
self-assertion.]{.underline}

**[Ironically among the emerging black middle class, current narratives
of selfhood and identity are saturated by the tropes of pain and
suffering]{.underline}**. Th[e latter have become the register through
which many now represent themselves to themselves and to the world. To
give account of who they are, or to explain themselves and their
behavior to others, **they increasingly tend to frame their life stories
in terms of how much they have been injured by the forces of racism,
bigotry and patriarchy.**]{.underline}

[Often under the pretext that the personal is political, this type of
**autobiographical and at times self-indulgent "petit bourgeois"
discourse has replaced structural analysis**]{.underline}. [Personal
feelings now suffice]{.underline}. **[There is no need to mount a proper
argument]{.underline}**.  **[Not only wounds and injuries can't they be
shared, their interpretation  cannot be challenged by any known rational
discourse. Why? Because, it is alleged, black experience transcends
human vocabulary to the point where it cannot be named]{.underline}**.

[This kind of argument is **dangerous**]{.underline}.

[The self is made at the point of encounter with an Other. There is no
self that is limited to itself.]{.underline}

**[The Other is our origin by definition]{.underline}**.

[What **makes us human** is our **capacity to share our condition** --
including our **wounds** and **injuries** -- with others]{.underline}.

[Anticipatory politics -- as opposed to retrospective politics -- is
about reaching out to others. **It is never about
self-enclosure**]{.underline}.

[The **best of black radical thought** has been about how we make sure
that in the work of repair, certain compensations **do not become
pathological phenomena**]{.underline}.

[It has been about **nurturing the capacity to resume a human life** in
the aftermath of irreparable loss.]{.underline}

**[Invoking Frantz Fanon, Steve Biko and countless others will come to
nothing if this ethics of becoming-with-others is not the cornerstone of
the new cycle of struggles.]{.underline}**

[There will be **no plausible critique of whiteness**, white
**privilege**, white monopoly **capitalism** that does not start from
the assumption that whiteness has become this accursed part of ourselves
we are deeply attached to, in spite of it threatening our own very
future well-being]{.underline}.

### Link---Black Disability

#### Their overly metaphysical reading of Black disability [precludes]{.underline} the opportunity for reclamation of human categories.

**Goodley, et al, 20**---iHuman, School of Education, UK (Dan, with
Rebecca Lawthom, Kirsty Liddiard, and Katherine Runswick-Cole, "The
Desire for New Humanisms," Journal of Disability Studies in Education,
July 29, 2020, dml)

[Humanness is **already brutally defined** in white, male, Eurocentric
terms]{.underline} that are optimally middle-class (see also Greene
Wade, 2017). The clash of the anti-colonial struggle is, for Wynter, the
desire to challenge the belief system on which our societies are
founded; the belief that 'the fact of blackness is a fact of inferiority
and that of whiteness a fact of superiority' (Wynter quoted in Scott,
2000: 132). [The Other]{.underline} -- [the **jobless**, **poor** and
**Black**]{.underline} ([and]{.underline} to which we would add
**[disabled]{.underline}**) -- [are afforded a '**narratively condemned
status**']{.underline} (Wynter, 1992: 18). The normative order of what
it is to be human -- this is [the **normalcy** of the human
category]{.underline} -- [is defined through **whiteness** and
**coloniality**]{.underline}. And the Other to this normative sameness
is not simply a passive opposite, a benign hidden referent nor powerless
empty identity position. And, just as importantly, [those that sit in
the gaps left by binaries live as **liminal identities**]{.underline}
(ones associated with deviance) [and hold **promise** -- as 'existential
liminalities' that speak from the margins]{.underline} (Wynter, in
Scott, 2000: 149) ... [to create **new imaginaries**]{.underline}
(Ibid:153) [and **new humanisms**]{.underline}. For Gilroy (2018: 7)
[this **reclaiming of humanness** from colonial humanist moorings (that
**frame** and **misrecognise** blackness in decidedly **infrahuman**
ways) is one **significant postcolonial imperative**]{.underline}
(Gilroy, 2018: 7). In other words, '[how might we]{.underline} become
more comprehensively estranged from the Anthropos in the Anthropocene in
order to [salvage a **different**, and]{.underline} perhaps
[**re-enchanted human**?]{.underline}' (Gilroy, 2018: 12)? How might we,
following Wynter, secure 'the well-being, and therefore the full
cognitive and behavioral autonomy of the human species
itself/ourselves'? (Wynter, 2003: 260). [The answer]{.underline} offered
[is]{.underline} a productive one '[a **cautious**, **post-humanist
humanism** capable of **grasping the relationship** between human and
non-human]{.underline} is beginning to take shape' (Gilroy, 2018: 16).
And [this politicisation struggles 'to endow a sense of **reciprocal
humanity** in]{.underline} Europe's [**proliferating encounters** with
vulnerable otherness']{.underline} (Gilroy, 2018: 19) [in the search for
new humanisms in 'the ongoing work of **salvaging imperilled humanity**
from the mounting wreckage']{.underline} (20).

We share this ambition [to seek out new humanisms]{.underline} in our
posthuman times. This [might involve]{.underline} us [**rethinking**
traditional or normative idealisations of **politics**, **resistance**
and **activism**]{.underline}. And it should definitely start from the
premise that Black, postcolonial and Critical Disability Studies are
already working the edges of the posthuman condition. The work of
Greene-Wade (2017) is useful here as it draws attention to the workings
of virtual-physical assemblages found in the Twitter activism associated
with. Green-Wade (2017) explains #Blacklivesmatter as an example of
**[viral blackness]{.underline}**. This she argues [provides one example
of a **new genre of being human** that challenges hegemonic technologies
of the self. The potency of #Blacklivesmatter was its ability to
**disrupt** the notion of humans as **purely organic/genetic content**
and, instead, **reboot Black humanities** through the practices of
virtual-physical assemblages that **subverted social hierarchies** and
placed the **needs** and **desires** of Black bodies at the
**centre**]{.underline} of this twitter activism. Viral Blackness is but
one example of new humanisms being refashioned in the posthuman
circulations of social media.

Just as Black Studies and activism should inspire us to reach out for
new human relations and formations of the human then we should also draw
in the contributions of critical disability studies. [Questions of the
human have **always been central** to the politics of
disability]{.underline}. And we write this observation at a poignant
time in the history of critical disability studies. The death of one of
the founding fathers of the social model of disability -- Professor Mike
Oliver -- in 2019 has inevitably unleashed numerous obituaries and
declarations of gratitude to his important work. Like the postcolonial
scholarship of writers such as Fanon and Wynter, Oliver's work can be
historically judged as a defining moment in critical writing by disabled
people, for disabled people, in social, economic and cultural conditions
that denigrated and threatened to erase the lives, contributions and
ontologies of disabled people. Oliver was a Marxist but also drew upon
Neo-Marxist theories such as Gramsci and Althusser in order to
interrogate the normative hegemony of capitalist society that upheld the
dominance of non-disabled people and pathologised the lives of disabled
people (Oliver, 1990, 1992. 1993a, 1993b, 1996). [Just as Wynter and
Fanon]{.underline} demanded us to [consider the ways in which Black
humanness is forced to **misrecognise itself** as not fully
human]{.underline} in the (post) colonial registers of contemporary
normative culture, so Oliver (1990) illuminated the alienation
experienced by disabled people as a consequence of ideologies of
individualism associated with non-disabled ontologies and ways of life.
In his 1990 book Politics of Disablement Oliver described the physical,
economic and material barriers to normative citizenship experienced by
disabled people in education, work and their communities. People with
physical, sensory and cognitive impairments are disabled -- not by their
bodies or minds -- but by a capitalist society that excludes them from
its labour and consumption. Moreover, [disabled people become
**essential objects** of]{.underline} normative [human]{.underline}
welfare services and [systems]{.underline}: creating an industry of
professionals (including psychologists, special educators, social
workers, rehabilitative consultants, counsellors) [whose main role is
the restoration of normality]{.underline} (to get disabled people as
near to normal as possible). Oliver's work built upon the intellectual
legacy left by disabled activists such as Paul Hunt. In A Critical
Condition, Hunt's famous chapter in his acclaimed edited book Stigma
(1966), he writes:

An impaired and deformed body is a 'difference' that hits everyone hard
at first. Inevitably it produces an instinctive revulsion, has a
disturbing effect ... The disabled person's 'strangeness' can manifest
and symbolize all differences between human beings ... for the
able-bodied, normal world we are representatives of many of the things
they most fear -- tragedy, loss, dark and the unknown. Involuntarily, we
walk -- or more often sit -- in the valley of the shadow of death ... a
deformed and paralysed body attacks everyone's sense of well-being and
invincibility. Hunt, 1966: 151--156

[Like Blackness, disability is understood in terms of the **failings**
and **failures of humanist humanity**. But what is so **enthralling** to
us is the idea that these failings can be **rewritten** as a
**politicised gift**]{.underline}, as evidenced by the quotations from
Hunt and Fanon that we present together below:

For the disabled person with a fair intelligence or other gifts, perhaps
the greatest temptation is to try to use them just to escape from his
disabledness, to buy himself a place in the sun, a share in the illusory
normal world where all is light and pleasure and happiness ... But if we
deny our special relation to the dark in this way, we shall have ceased
to recognise our most important asset as disabled people in society --
the uncomfortable, subversive position from which we act as a living
reproach to any scale of values that puts attributes or possessions
beyond the person. Hunt, 1966: 158--159

Black consciousness is immanent in its own eyes. I am not a potentiality
of something. I am wholly what I am. I do not have to look for the
universal ... My negro consciousness does not hold itself out as lack.
It is. Fanon, 1993: 135

How might we reclaim **[new humanisms]{.underline}** in these posthuman
times that [**celebrate** and **harness** the politics of **Blackness**
and **disability**]{.underline}? What social models of disability can be
developed that build on disability's 'special relation to the dark'
shadows of normative humanism? In what ways can education, educators,
teachers and learners engage [together in new humanist projects that
**foreground the aspirations** of those human beings who are **often
negated** by ethno-class able-bodied-and-minded man?]{.underline}

3 Six New Humanist Projects for Disability Studies and Education

Thus far we have exposed the problematics inherent within normative
conceptions of the humanist human and have provided critical responses
from the fields. We have broadly conceived of these fields as
postcolonial and critical disability studies. Like Erevelles (2012) we
are encouraged by the offerings of these perspectives; especially when
they are brought together for generative reasons. We want to now
consider the implications and applications of our analyses for research,
scholarship and engagement in the areas of (critical) disability studies
and education: the very focus of this journal. We posit six [new
humanist projects]{.underline}. We [are taken with the possibilities of
thinking]{.underline} through, with and across postcolonial and critical
disability studies. Like Titchkosky (2015) we are excited by the
possibilities of [**bringing together** these potentially radical and
disruptive modes of transformational thinking but, at the same time, are
conscious of the **frictional demands** of each approach]{.underline}.
It would be a mistake to assume that postcolonial and critical
disability studies do not create fits of pique within one another.
Moreover, one might argue that studies of disability have lacked
racialised analyses -- assuming whiteness (Miles et al., 2017) -- while
postcolonial scholarship continues to unproblematically draw on a host
of disabling metaphors (Titchkosky, 2015). We acknowledge these
limitations at the same time as we propose six new humanist
intersectional projects.

The first project relates to subjecting the normative, the hegemonic and
the taken-for-granted to sustained analysis and critique. Following
Wynter (2006: 112), just as there is a need to exoticize Western thought
-- to render the familiar strange -- so there is an urgent need to
exoticize normative humanistic conceptions of valued humanness. This
means, then, exoticizing the educational status quo. It means gathering
penetrating insights gained from a 'wide range of globally subordinated
peoples' (Wynter, 2006: 112). We would want to ask: what is this
strange, freakish, normative education system that upholds the authority
of a certain kind of learner; the white, middle class, heterosexual,
reasonable, speaking-a-standard language, living in towns, Western
European, settler subject with a deep rooted colonial ancestry
(following Braidotti, 2002, 2013; Slater, 2015)?

The second project: endlessly acknowledge and address the ways in which
educational systems impose a collective ontological sense of 'wrongness
of being' (Wynter, 2006) upon disabled children and young people. When
kindergartens, schools, colleges and universities are designed with
non-disabled, autonomous, independent, white, capable, isolated,
self-sufficient learners in mind then there is a risk that such
normative conceptions of the human rewrite their hidden referents
associated with disabled, dependent, non-white, incapable, reliant Human
Others. How often do we hear from disabled children and young people
that they 'do not belong' in educational settings? These are not simply
calls for recognition. They are calling out the alienating tendencies of
educational institutions that actively resist the contributions of
students who fail to fit the normative human that is implicitly centred
in those institutions as the kinds of human beings we deal with here.

The third project is: [promote]{.underline} the
**[sociogeny]{.underline}** of disability and education. Sociogeny is a
concept developed by Fanon (1993) -- and one elaborated by Wynter (2003)
-- that refers to [the study of the development of a social
phenomenon]{.underline}. In counter-distinction to phylogeny (the study
of evolution of the species) and ontogeny (the biological development of
an individual organism) -- [a sociogeny **unpacks the social**,
**historical** and **cultural constitution** of race and
humanness]{.underline} (see Gagne, 2007 for a helpful overview). [**Do
not assume** that education nor disability nor Blackness are
**pre-social**, **apolitical**, **objective**, **independent**,
**universal phenomena**. They are **anything but this**. When we read
disability in through the methodologies of phylogeny or ontogeny we
**reduce disability** to stories of evolution or biology]{.underline}.1
[Disability is **fundamentally a social**, **cultural**, **political**
and **psycho-social phenomenon** through and through; and
**requires**]{.underline}, therefore, [**sociogeny** as a
response]{.underline}.

### Link---Black Feminism

#### Prioritizing theoretical parochialism over material activism aligns [more with misogynoir]{.underline} than with the historical tradiction of Black women's activism.

**Harvell, 10**---Professor in the theology department at Pennsylvania
State University, Abington College (Valeria, "Afrocentric Humanism and
African American Women's Humanizing Activism," Journal of Black Studies,
Volume 40, Number 6, July 2010, 1052-1074, dml)

Delores Williams (1997) is correct when she asserts that African
American women "\[struggled\] along with Black men and children for the
liberation, survival and positive quality of life for our entire
oppressed Black community" (p. 97). But Black women's
liberation-humanization struggles did not always follow the same
pathways as those travelled by Black men: always the same destination,
perhaps but, at times, by a different route. Tiyi Morris (2003) captures
what made [Black women's activism]{.underline} distinctive when she
notes that it [was based on their "**experiences as women** and
**mothers** in their families and communities" and]{.underline} that it
["\[evolved\] from a perspective that **\[recognized\] the multiple
oppressions**" they faced as Black women]{.underline} (p. 49). [Through
the **simultaneous interaction of gender**, **race**, and **class**,
Black women have acquired what has been termed a "**multiple
consciousness**," a **triad of cognitive processing skills** based on
experience, from which has emerged a **multifaceted critique of
oppression** and]{.underline}, in turn, [a **multidimensional view of
liberation** and **humanization**]{.underline} (Collins, 1990, 1998;
Joseph, 1995; King, 1988/1990; Riggs, 1994).

To illustrate, Harding's (1983) narration of the "Great Tradition of
Black Protest" is brimming with examples of how **[Black
men]{.underline}**, both in word and deed, [defended]{.underline} such
[principles]{.underline} as the rights of self-determination and
dignity, presumably **[on behalf of]{.underline}** all **[African
Americans]{.underline}**. There are other historical studies (e.g.,
Adler, 1992; Austin, 2006; Carby, 1998; Collins, 1992; Dubey, 1994;
Gaines, 1996; Giddings, 1984; Jordan-Zachery, 2007; Ling & Monteith,
1999), however, that indicate that [the men from this "Great Tradition"
fought for **Blacks' rights**, **needs**, and
**interests**]{.underline}, to be sure, but [mainly in terms of
**patriarchal prerogatives** alone]{.underline}.

[**In contrast**, African American women declared that the **rights of
all of human beings** were "**sacred** and **inviolable**,"
**regardless** of the person's **sex**, **race**, **country**, or
**condition**]{.underline} (Cooper, 1893/1976, p. 330). Some of the
earliest examples on record of how African Americans, in general, used
the "power of Word" to guide and justify their quest for liberation, in
fact, came from religious Black women who denounced efforts to make
God's graces selective. [Beginning in the **19th century**, there were
Black women who, in the midst of **fierce opposition** and with
"**heavenly zeal**"]{.underline} (Elizabeth, 1863/1988, p. 11),
[preached an **egalitarian Gospel**]{.underline}, with emphasis on the
belief that "the Saviour died for the woman as well as the man" (Lee,
1836/1986, p. 36). Historian Betty Collier-Thomas's (1998) analysis of
sermons by African American women preachers of the 19th and 20th
centuries highlights the fact that some of these women attempted to
demonstrate that neither the Gospel nor the Holy Spirit showed any race
or gender partiality.

Relying on "a plethora of supernatural abilities as sources of their
spiritual and social empowerment," Gayle Tate (2003, p. 172) claims that
these early 19th century Black women evangelists went forth "with the
dual mission of converting souls and spearheading a new social
consciousness" (p. 177). Through their "proselytizing and protest in the
larger society," these Black women evangelists challenged both racial
and gender oppression (p. 177), and they were "openly combative in
challenging\... ecclesiastical sexism" (p. 181).

Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Black women continued to
challenge those religious institutions where, purportedly, the equality,
uniqueness, and worthiness of each individual were considered sacred
(Mitchell & Lewter, 1986, pp. 93, 112).4 In studies of **[Black Baptist
churchwomen]{.underline}** during this period, Evelyn Higginbotham
(1993, p. 120) reports that they [developed an **inclusive theology**
that stressed equal gender participation. They attempted to apply the
"**principle of human equality** and **dignity under God**" to encompass
both **racial** and **gender concerns**]{.underline} (Higginbotham,
1996, p. 150). Moreover, [these women "found]{.underline} scriptural
[precedents for expanding women's rights]{.underline}" in both the
secular and sacred arenas (Higginbotham, 1993, p. 120). [Similar
trends]{.underline} have been found in other denominations as well
(e.g., Dodson, 1988; Gilkes, 2001, chaps. 3 to 5), all of which
[reflect]{.underline} not only the influence of religion on [Black
women's]{.underline} unique interpretation of the
liberation-humanization central theme but also the **[specific forms of
political activism]{.underline}** aimed at transforming one
institution---the church.

Black women have well understood that the liberation of the whole person
and the humanization of the entire society require the transformation of
institutions and the elimination of race and sex discrimination. Writes
Rossetta Ross (1997), they relied

on what they understood as God's provisions in their lives, the women
demonstrated fidelity to God by routinely working hard and taking risks
as they sought to change repressive traditions, institutions and social
conventions that generally hampered the well-being of African Americans.
(p. 41)

Beyond the mere rhetoric of inclusiveness, however, Black women's clubs,
societies, associations, and auxiliaries usually reflected in fact both
a "race conscious and gender-centered" approach to community service.
"For club women, race and women's rights were one issue" (D. G. White,
1999, p. 68). They insisted on a more holistic interpretation and
application of "liberation," one that included men, women, and children
(e.g., Gilkes, 2001; Higginbotham, 1993; Riggs, 1994; Springer, 1999).
As activist Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, a national leader of the 19th
century Black women's club movement, declared, "Our woman's movement is
a woman's movement in that it is led and directed by women for the good
of women and men, for the benefit of all humanity \[italics added\]"
(quoted in Carby, 1987, p. 117).

Examples abound which show that Ruffin was expressing a general
sentiment felt and acted on by most Black women club participants. For
instance, according to author Lillian Williams (1995), the Black women's
clubs operating in Buffalo, New York, between 1900 and 1940

addressed the subordinate status to which blacks, especially women and
children, had been consigned and so they worked with black men to
redress their grievances as blacks and women. These women saw themselves
as critical links in a social movement designed to liberate the black
community from second-class citizenship. Their participation in
community liberation struggles was a means of empowerment for them as
individuals. (p. 521, italics added)

Speaking on the roles of the Independent Order of Saint Luke women of
Richmond, Virginia---a group spearheaded by Maggie Walker---Elsa Brown
(1989/1990) noted that they "challenged notions in the black community
about the proper role of women; they challenged notions in the white
community about the proper place of blacks" (p. 194). Most importantly,
they "strove to create an equalitarian organization" (p. 193), one that
emphasized "collective consciousness and collective responsibility" to
the family and community (p. 182).

[Among the **first** and **most significant contributions** African
American women made to the **humanistic motif** was their **enduring
effort to reclaim** and **reassert its holistic meaning**]{.underline},
one [that **resonated** with the **original equalitarian principles**
and **social inclusivity of African humanism**]{.underline}. Jacqueline
Royster (2000) contends that [Black women were]{.underline} also [able
to sustain a "**wholeness**"]{.underline}---"a psychic wholeness [forged
at **great cost** but in the interest of the **health** and **prosperity
of community** for which they felt responsible. Hard-won strengths of
spirit became a **well-spring for activism**, **advocacy**, and
**action**"]{.underline} (p. 113). [**Inclusivity of vision** and
**practical activities** were their **hallmarks** of the past and their
**bountiful legacy** for the future]{.underline}.

Analyzing the ethical teachings from several worldwide religions but
with a particular emphasis on the meaning of the "ethical practice of
service" as presented in the sacred writings from Africa, Karenga (2008)
draws several noteworthy conclusions. He opines that [the ethics of
service means **bringing**, **sustaining**, and **increasing the good**
in the world and the "**building** and **maintaining of structures**" or
**frameworks** that advance "the **practice of service**, especially to
the **poor**, **less powerful**, the **ill**, the **aged**, the
**disabled** and those **disadvantaged** by a system of oppression in
the world"]{.underline} (pp. 34-35, 45). [**No other group** in America
has **had less** of the material world but **worked harder** at
fulfilling these imperatives than African American women]{.underline}.
As Fannie Williams (1896-1897/1997a) makes abundantly clear, [Black
women were "**bent on making their goodness felt wherever good influence
is needed**"]{.underline} (p. 114):

Benevolence \[was\] the essence of most of the colored women's
organizations. The humane side of their natures has been cultivated to
recognize the duties they owe to the sick, the indigent and
ill-fortuned. No church, school, or charitable institution for the
special use of colored people has been allowed to languish or fail when
the associated efforts of the women could save it. (F. B. Williams,
1893/1976, pp. 273-274, italics added)

Writing on "The Awakening of \[Black\] Women" to the "their importance
in all things" pertaining to "the social betterment of the Negro race,"
F. B. Williams (1896-1897/1997a) explains the attitudes and beliefs that
guided their service to the race:

The supreme thing is the spirit of duty, the enthusiasm for action, and
the untrammeled sympathy. By sympathy is not meant that far-away,
kid-gloved and formal something that enables women merely to know of
those who need them, but that deeper more spiritual impulse to
helpfulness that will enable them to find delight in working with,
rather than for, the unfortunate of their sex. In social reforms we must
see but one thing, and that is the vivid soul of humanity---that
divinity which neither rags, dirt nor immoralities can entirely obscure.
(p. 114)

F. B. Williams (1900/1997b) also vividly details [the **inhumane
conditions** visited on the poor, the weak, and the most
vulnerable]{.underline}, which, in fact, **[propelled Black women into
action]{.underline}**:

[The incentive \[to organize\]]{.underline} in most cases [was **quite
simple** and **direct**. How to **help** and **protect** some
defenseless and tempted young women; how to **aid some poor boy** to
complete a **much-coveted education**; how to **lengthen the short
school term**]{.underline} in some improvised school district; [how to
**instruct** and **interest deficient mothers** in the difficulties of
child training]{.underline} are some of the motives that led to the
formation of the great majority of these clubs. These were the first
out-reachings of sympathy and fellowship felt by women whose lives had
been narrowed by the petty concerns of the struggle for existence and
removed by human cruelty from all the harmonies of freedom, love and
aspiration. (p. 121)

After examining a host of Black women's clubs and voluntary associations
that developed at the local, state, and national levels, Gerda Lerner
(1974) summarizes,

The impulse for **[organizing]{.underline}** arose wherever an urgent
social need remained unmet \[italics added\]. Most frequently, women's
clubs were formed in order to provide kindergartens, nursery schools or
day care centers for black children. The virtual absence of social
welfare institutions in many Southern communities, and the frequent
exclusion of Blacks from those that existed, led black women to found
orphanages, old folks' homes and similar institutions. (p. 159)

What Lerner describes [was **characteristic** of the type of
**broad-based humanistic activities** in which Black women **frequently
engaged**]{.underline} during the 19th and 20th centuries, [an
**important part** of Black history that has been **well documented for
decades**]{.underline}. Darlene Clarke Hine (1994) notes,

In virtually every city and rural community in the twentieth-century
America there existed an organized grouping of black women, often led by
a cadre of elite educated black middle-class matrons. . . . Almost every
black women's club, regardless of who founded it or the ostensible
reason for its establishment, focused to some extent on alleviating one
or more of the many social problems afflicting an increasingly urban,
impoverished, politically powerless, and segregated black population.
(p. 15)

Hine (1994) goes on to conclude that the "philanthropic work of
nineteenthand early-twentieth-century African American women ensured the
survival of many of the most vulnerable members of the black population"
(p. 109).

Although many [African America women's clubs and
associations]{.underline} frequently framed their raison d'être around
home and family, they [were]{.underline} equally [involved **waging
broader battles for political** and **economic justice** on behalf of
the **entire Black community**. Among the prominent issues undertaken
were **economic exploitation**, **political disenfranchisement**,
**segregation**, **lynching**, **educational inequities**, **slum
landlords**, **rent gouging**, **deficient sanitation systems**, and
**inadequate health facilities**]{.underline} (e.g., A. D. Gordon, 1997;
Hine, 1994; Hodges, 2000; Perkins, 1981; Scott, 1990; Springer, 1999).
[**Any new development** or **event** with the potential of alternately
**improving** or **adversely affecting** the quality of life for Blacks
became an **area of concern** and an **arena of activism** for African
American women]{.underline}. Paradoxically, [these]{.underline} early
**[reform initiatives]{.underline}** designed and intended to help the
Black community later [proved **beneficial** and
**supportive**]{.underline} to poor and working-class White families as
well.

[The **wide-ranging**, **ever-expanding record** of activities of the
African American woman]{.underline}---to labor both within the home and
without, to educate, to nurture, to empower, transcending adversity and
improving, with limited resources, her environment and community---[is
**unmatched in history**]{.underline}. Jualyne Dodson and Cheryl Gilkes
(1986) argue convincingly,

[The ties that bind the black community together **exist primarily**
because of the **vigilant action of black women**]{.underline}. . . .
[The **overwhelming importance** **and pivotal position**
of]{.underline} black women in all aspects of community organization---
education, civil rights, organized labor, business, politics, religion,
the professions, and club work---earned them the greatest accolades and
the most pernicious stereotypes. . . . \[The\] black women of the
twentieth century were the source of community endurance---"the
something within that holdeth the reins"---enabling black people to
resist and to hope. (p. 81)

By combining [the **communal** and **humanistic ethos** from their
African past]{.underline} with their own interpretation of the
Scriptures, African American women were able to [fashioned that
"**something within**" that **fueled their zeal** to serve and uplift
the community]{.underline}. Dodson and Gilkes (1986) reinforce this
point well when they state,

If anything characterizes the role of black women in religion in
America, it is the successful extension of their individual sense of
regeneration, release, redemption, and spiritual liberation to a
collective ethos of struggle for and with the entire black community.
(p. 81)

[African American women saw themselves **in relationship to the whole
community** and **directed their sociopolitical activities
accordingly**. They created **countless organizations**]{.underline} and
religious associations [committed to the **collective survival of Black
people**]{.underline}, including willy-nilly their families, their
children, their men, and their neighbors. In their role as caretaker of
the home, family, church, school, and community, [African American women
were the ones who **nurtured the race** and helped **build life itself**
in the mist of **bondage**, **Jim** and **Jane Crowism**, **lynching**,
**chronic unemployment**, **poverty**, **rape**, **assaults**,
**insults**, and **rampant discrimination**]{.underline}. Perhaps better
than their brethren, [they understood that "if survival were to be on a
**human** and **not merely an animal level**"]{.underline} (Harding,
1983, p. 51), [then life must be **adorned** and **infused with
integrity**, **love**, **hope**, **dreams**, and **joy**, in **spite**
of the **despotic system** and **cruel conditions** they confronted.
They labored not only to **sustain** but also to **embellish life** with
**whatever meager resources they had** at their disposal]{.underline} or
could wrest from a selfish "land of plenty." [They also **labored
mightily** to **bestow**]{.underline} on their families and race hope,
dignity, and pride and to [**preserve** and **transmit the same
life-affirming values** to the next generation]{.underline}.

### Link---Framework

#### The [only role of the ballot]{.underline} is to signify the winner of the game---using it for other purposes, or creatively bending the rules to re-orient pedagogy, [fails]{.underline} and [reproduces the failures of modernity]{.underline} in [comparatively more insidious ways]{.underline} as long as it's [tied to competitive incentives]{.underline}---the system may be unsustainable but we shouldn't uncritically hasten its demise---you should err towards [learning from the shortcomings]{.underline} of debate while [recuperating the tools]{.underline} of [self-reflection]{.underline} and [alternative-building]{.underline} that it can still provide us.

pp. 21-40 2015, dml)

System walk out ([alternatives 'with guarantees']{.underline})
[**enunciates a commitment to develop alternatives** to modernity that
**will not reproduce its violences**. Alternative communities and
epistemologies are **developed** or **reclaimed in spaces** that may be
**external** or **marginal** to mainstream institutions, either as
**supplementary**, **transitional**, or **wholesale
alternatives**]{.underline}. While 'walking out' often leads to
remarkably creative and generative spaces, [these spaces **may
nonetheless reproduce**]{.underline} at least some of [the **same
problems as modernity**, as they are **still broadly situated within its
teleological grammar**, particularly in its **dialectically structured
desire for an uncontaminated 'outside'**. This focus on alternatives
'with guarantees' tends to **support the same affective investments**
(e.g. in **fixed teleologies**, **normativity**, **consensus**, and
**innocence**) and can lead to the **foreclosure of the complexities**
and **complicities** that arise in the **making of
alternatives**]{.underline}.

[System hacking involves **creating spaces within the system**, **using
its resources**, where people can be **educated about the violences of
the system** and **have their desires re-oriented away from it**. This
requires '**playing the game**' of institutions at the same time that
**rules are bent to generate alternative outcomes**]{.underline}. This
strategy can also be remarkably creative and generative; however, [it
can be **difficult to recognize** when one is '**hacking**' the system
or '**being hacked**' by it]{.underline}. In addition, like system walk
outs, [the **risk of reproducing modernity's violence precisely when one
is trying to move beyond it remains high** as the success of initiatives
is **measured in identifiable outcomes**, and identities may become
**scripted around vanguardist heroism** that **inadvertently recentres
individuals**.]{.underline}

In contrast to system walk out, system 'hospicing' recognizes that
[although ultimately new systems are necessary, alternatives articulated
from within modernity's frames will tend to reproduce it]{.underline}.
In identifying modernity's metaphysical enclosures, hospicing
problematizes the desire to embrace or reject modernity as a form of
desire where modern subjects demand the world conform to our will
(Silva, 2014). Instead, [**hospicing** would entail **sitting with a
system in decline**, **learning from its history**, **offering
palliative care**, **seeing oneself in that which is dying**,
**attending to the integrity of the process**]{.underline}, dealing with
tantrums, incontinence, anger and hopelessness, 'cleaning up', [and
**clearing the space for something new**]{.underline}. This is unlikely
to be a glamorous process; it will entail many frustrations, an
uncertain timeline, and unforeseeable outcomes without guarantees.

Our definition of hospicing entails three different insights. One, that
[the modern global capitalist system is **unsustainable**, and that it
is **already collapsing**]{.underline}. Two, that [our **current
languages**, **identities** and **sense-making** are **inescapably
historically connected** to it]{.underline}. Three, that [we need to be
**properly taught by the system's successes** and **failures** by
**facing its death** and **attending to its affliction** rather than
**turning our back** or **attempting to murder it before it is ready to
go**. Hospicing enacts a **willingness to learn enough** from the
**(re)current mistakes of the current system** in order to **make
different mistakes** in **caring for the arrival of something new**.
Going through the pains of this death, and **recognizing we have been
both bewildered** and **enchanted** by the mythology of the
Enlightenment, may be the **only way we can really understand** the
depth of modernity's limits (within us) and **recognize its real
gifts**]{.underline}.

[Hospicing demands a critique that is **self-implicated rather than
heroic**, **vanguardist** or '**innocent**'. It demands a kind of
courage that is]{.underline} un-neurotic (**[not invested in
self-affirmation]{.underline}**): [a kind of courage that helps us to
**look the bull in the eye**, to **recognize ourselves in the bull**,
and to **see the bull as a teacher**, **precisely when it is trying to
kill us**]{.underline}. In practice, this means that [**experimenting
with alternatives** is]{.underline} perceived as [**important not for
generating predetermined solutions**, but rather as a **means to be
taught by the successes** and **failures of the experimentation
process**]{.underline}. [These teachings are **indispensible** for
**exploring the depths** of the existing system, and for **learning to
discern between its poisons** and its **medicines**. In this space, the
effects of violence and pain are attended to; at the same time that
there is also an acute attention to the roots and mechanisms of the
disease so that its death **leaves a legacy of prudence** that **grounds
the emergence of something radically new** and **potentially
wiser**]{.underline}. We represent this possibility as a question mark
in our forth space where other modes of existence grounded on different
cosmologies operate. The question mark indicates that [these are
**unintelligible** to those **entrapped in the metaphysics of
modernity** (which **does not mean** they are **separate from our
experience**, or **beyond meaning** and **understanding**).]{.underline}

### Link---Futurity

#### Organizing around futurity is important in order to create opportunities for marginalized communities to flourish.

**Kuttner, 17**---Education Partnership Manager & Director for Community
Engaged Scholarship, University Neighborhood Partners, University of
Utah (Paul, "Futurism, Futurity, and the Importance of the Existential
Imagination," <http://culturalorganizing.org/futurism-futurity/>, dml)

[Organizers and activists also seem to be taking an **increased interest
in the future**]{.underline}. In 2015, [the Movement for Black
Lives]{.underline} and Huffington Post [launched an annual celebration
of Black Futures Month]{.underline}, a remixing of Black History Month
[that calls on people to "**seize the opportunity** to **change the
course of history** by **shaping our future**."]{.underline} That same
year, AK press put out Octavia's Brood, an engrossing collection of SF
short stories written by activists and organizers. Of course, [social
justice organizing is often **driven by a vision of a future** better
than the one we live in. But **something deeper** is going on here: a
recognition that the future, **despite its intangibility**, is
**directly impacting us today**. Take US politics. The election campaign
that lifted 45 to the presidency was **premised largely on fear of the
future**]{.underline}. In his speeches and tweets, 45 conjured an
imagined future in which the US is overrun by "terrorists," "rapists,"
and "criminals" from across our borders. In this racist, dystopian
future, white people sacrifice power and safety amid hostile aliens.
This future is not real in any concrete sense. And yet, it affects the
present in multiple ways --- increasing support for racist policies,
emboldening white supremacist organizations, and igniting hate crimes,
just to name a few. In this sense, the future is what Andrew Baldwin
calls a "permanent virtuality," unreal and yet ever-present.6 Scholars
have taken to using the term futurity to explore these interactions
between past, present, and future. From my reading, [futurity refers to
three main dynamics]{.underline}: [The ways that the future is
**defined**]{.underline} (or "rendered knowable") [through]{.underline}
practices such as prediction, [**projection**, **imagination**,
**prefiguration**, and **prophecy**]{.underline};7 [The ways that the
future **impacts the present**]{.underline}, for example [through
**fear**, **hope**, **preparation**, and
**preemption**]{.underline};8and [The ways that our thoughts and actions
in reference to the future **make some futures more likely**, and others
**less likely**, to come about]{.underline}.9 In his book Cruising
Utopia, José Esteban Muñoz proposes that [queerness is a **kind of
futurity**]{.underline}. "Queerness," he writes in the book's
introduction, "is not yet here...Put another way, we are not yet
queer."10 Instead, he explains, [queerness is an **ideal**. It is a
**utopian vision** that can help us to **see beyond our everyday
restrictions** toward new possibilities]{.underline}. We cannot touch
queerness with our hands, or claim to fully know what it is. We can,
however, get glimpses of it, particularly in the realm of cultural
production. Through poems, plays, visual art, dance, and other types of
performance, artists can step away from what Munoz calls "straight time"
--- that sense that the present is natural and enduring --- to suggest
alternative futurities. [The concept of futurity seems to have been most
fully developed by **Indigenous scholars** and **activists**. As Native
scholars have shown, settler colonialism]{.underline} (the kind of
colonialism we have in the US, where the colonizer comes to stay)
[involves an **ongoing project of erasure** and
**replacement**]{.underline}.11 After all, [settler claims]{.underline}
to the land in the Americas, the Pacific Islands, and elsewhere [**only
make sense** if the original inhabitants are **gone**. And, **despite
centuries of genocide**, **they are not**]{.underline}. [Part of the
modern settler project, then, is to **erase Indigenous peoples** --- if
not **physically**]{.underline} ([through **policies**]{.underline} that
deny land, health care, etc.) [or **culturally**]{.underline} ([through
**blood quantum tests** or the **forced removal of
children**]{.underline}), [then at least from **popular
consciousness**]{.underline}. Movies, television shows, **[school
curricula]{.underline}**, political speeches, news reports, and other
media [relegate "the Indian" to our past]{.underline} --- a sad chapter
in history, perhaps, but nothing to concern ourselves with as we dream
of the future. [By erasing Indigenous people from the present and the
future, these discourses advance the cause of]{.underline} what scholars
like Eve Tuck call **[settler futurity]{.underline}**. In other words,
these discourses are premised on, and help to bring about, a future of
endless settler dominance over the land and all that is on/of it.12
[Indigenous communities, though, are **(re)claiming the future** ---
**opening up space** for indigenous futurities to
**flourish**]{.underline}.13 [To **advance indigenous futurity** is to
**assert**, and **takes steps to make possible**, futures outside of
settler colonialism. We can get glimpses of indigenous futurities in the
social movement organizing of **Idle No More**, among the water
protectors at **Standing Rock**, in the **Indigenous media production**
of Indian and Cowboy, and in **everyday assertions** of Native culture
and sovereignty]{.underline}. Noelani Goodyear-Kaʻōpua writes that,
although they are often framed as relics of the past, [Indigenous
communities are actually **at the front lines** of the struggle to
**protect the future**]{.underline}. Writing about Native Hawaiian
efforts to defend cultural and natural resources, she notes that "When
colonial discourses frame blockades at Newcastle or on Mauna a Wākea as
obstructions on a march to "the future," they miss the ways this kind of
activism is actually protecting the possibilities of multiple
futures."14 This work is rooted deeply in Indigenous cultural practices
and epistemologies, which, according to Hawaiian activist and blogger
Bryan Kamaoli Kuwada, have always attended to both the past and the
future. "The future is a realm we have inhabited for thousands of years.
You cannot do otherwise when you rely on the land and sea to survive.
All of our gathering practices and agricultural techniques, the
patterned mat of loʻi kalo, the breath passing in and out of the loko
iʻa, the Kū and Hina of picking plants are predicated on looking ahead.
This ensures that the land is productive into the future, that the sea
will still be abundant into the future, and that our people will still
thrive into the future."15 A Final Note When I was coming up in the
world of social justice arts and organizing, much of the focus was on
history. We studied how injustices like racism and colonialism were
historically constructed. We learned how histories of activism and
rebellion had been hidden, rewritten, and co-opted to reinforce the
right of those in power to rule. We supported youth as they came to see
themselves as part of long social movement traditions. This focus on the
past was, and is, terribly important. At the same time, I am energized
by what [I see]{.underline} as [a **growing emphasis on the future** as
an **arena of active struggle**]{.underline}. Because [that's
**certainly how those in power see it**. Wall street traders are
**gambling on our futures**. Tech companies are **redesigning our
futures**. Hollywood is **whitewashing our futures**. And all the while,
unfettered capitalism is **foreclosing so many healthy futures for this
planet**. **Imagining alternative futures** is, **quite literally**, a
matter of **life** and **death**]{.underline}. [The **struggle for
futurity is on**, and as]{.underline} artists and [cultural workers we
are **right in the middle of it**, whether we know it or
not]{.underline}. It's time to accept the invitation of Bryan Kamaoli
Kuwada: "We live in the future," he writes. "Come join us."16

### Link---Law

#### Legal institutions can be turned [against]{.underline} violent power relations [despite]{.underline} their repressive history. Rejecting them wholesale [dooms]{.underline} radical social change.

**McCann and Lovell, 18**---Gordon Hirabayashi Professor for the
Advancement of Citizenship at the University of Washington AND professor
of political science, department chair, and the Harry Bridges Endowed
Chair in Labor Studies at the University of Washington (Michael and
George, "Toward a Radical Politics of Rights: Lessons about Legal
Leveraging and Its Limitations," *From the Streets to the State:
Changing the World by Taking Power*, Chapter 7, 139-141, dml)

[In]{.underline} our [aspirations for progressive change]{.underline},
[engaging with the law is **not a free choice** among
tactics]{.underline}. [It is a **necessity**]{.underline}. Egalitarian
[activists are **routinely forced** into legal engagement by the
**omnipresence** of law as a **violent force** imposing hierarchical
order and]{.underline} harsh [punitive constraints]{.underline} on
oppressed populations. Although activists are often motivated by the
quest for legal recognition of rights claims, [offensively mobilizing
law to support egalitarian struggles is only a **small
part**]{.underline} of movement appeals to law. [Defensive actions to
**evade** law's repressive force or to **protect** previous gains are
often **much more significant**]{.underline}. In our view, there is
surprisingly little rigorous theorizing about the different types of
struggles on the terrain of law, the most useful indicators of effective
legal action, and especially the measures of egalitarian or inclusionary
change.1

[Law is an **enduring site** for progressive democratic
contestation]{.underline}. [Although]{.underline} official law is
[**often** a tool of **repression**]{.underline}, [legal norms and
institutions can **also** be resources for **egalitarian rights
claims**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, at certain historical moments,
[even **social transformation**]{.underline}. [No matter how radical
one's]{.underline} political [aspirations]{.underline}, [the
**necessarily long-run character** of revolutionary social
transformation **requires** a series of **intermediate
steps**]{.underline}, **[including]{.underline}** those [on the
**terrain of law**]{.underline}. As the British socialist E. P. Thompson
(1975) asserts,

Most \[people\] have a strong sense of justice, at least with regard to
their own interests. [If the law is evidently partial and
unjust]{.underline}, [then it will **mask** nothing]{.underline},
[**legitimize** nothing]{.underline}, [**contribute** nothing to **any**
class's hegemony]{.underline}. The essential precondition for the
effectiveness of [law]{.underline}, in its function as ideology,
[is]{.underline} that it shall display an independence from gross
manipulation and shall seem to be just. . . . The rhetoric and the rules
of a society are something [a **great deal more than
sham**]{.underline}. In the same moment they may modify, in profound
ways, the behavior of the powerful, and mystify the powerless. [They may
**disguise** the true realities of power]{.underline},
[but]{.underline}, **[at the same time]{.underline}**, [they may
**curb** that power and **check** its intrusions]{.underline}. . . . And
[it is often from **within**]{.underline} that very rhetoric
[that]{.underline} a **[radical critique]{.underline}** of the practice
of the society [is developed]{.underline}. (436--39)

In this chapter, we describe legal mobilization as the articulation of a
social interest, general policy, or a societal vision in terms of legal
entitlement. As Frances Kahn Zemans (1983) famously put it, legal
mobilization entails that "a desire or want . . . is translated into a
demand as an assertion of one's rights" (3). [Since legal language is
**indeterminate** and **polyvalent**]{.underline}, [it is
**contestable**]{.underline}. [Dominant legal norms are **incomplete**
and **rife with tensions**]{.underline}, [and they **adapt** as
the]{.underline} perceived [interests of dominant groups respond
to]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} occasionally [converge
with]{.underline}, [the demands of oppressed groups]{.underline} (Bell
1980). Although much legal contestation occurs between recognized
rights-bearing subjects over the authoritative meaning of clashing
liberal legal principles, [legal mobilization also involves oppressed
groups **mobilizing liberal principles** against
**illiberal**]{.underline}, [**repressive modes** of social
control]{.underline}. These [contests over]{.underline} ascribed race,
gender, sexual, immigrant, and other [marginalized identities often
**expand** the rule of liberal legalism]{.underline} (Smith 1997; Orren
1992). More importantly, [struggles by progressive activists can use the
**liberal principle** of equal citizenship to **counter the property-
and contract-based principles of capitalism**]{.underline}, thereby
[**challenging** unequal resource distribution and class
exploitation]{.underline} (Brown 2003; Smith 1997). As Stuart Scheingold
(1974) argues, "**[law cuts both ways]{.underline}**," [both for and
against]{.underline} egalitarian [social justice]{.underline} (91; see
also McCann 1994).

When, how, and [to what degree legal discourse and institutions provide
resources for oppressed groups **depends**]{.underline} largely [on the
**mix of legal**]{.underline} and especially extralegal [**factors** in
a given]{.underline} historical [context]{.underline}. Our research
devotes considerable attention to the changing features of the cultural
and institutional terrain that delimit the possibilities and forms of
contestation within and against law. Of course, [fighting for control of
legal institutions and principles **does not guarantee** radical social
change]{.underline}. [But succumbing to anti-legalism **cedes control**
over the terms of **institutional organization**]{.underline},
**[instrumental rule]{.underline}**, [and **regime legitimation** to
dominant forces propelling capitalism and other
hierarchies]{.underline}.

We recognize that our approach is at odds with some important recent
movements and their interpreters. Arguably, the Occupy movements in and
beyond the United States expressed a notable disdain for legal rights
claiming, litigation strategies, and general appeals to legal strategies
(Almog and Barzilai 2014). This disenchantment with law, legal
processes, and lawyers is understandable in the post-civil rights era
and the immediate post-recession moment. Indeed, [wariness about law is
always sound]{.underline}. Moreover, Occupy did profoundly reorient the
dominant agenda in many parts of the global North. It put "deficit and
debt hawks" on the defense and elevated concerns about economic fairness
and the political accountability of private financial managers. [At the
same time]{.underline}, Occupy espoused and enacted little in the way of
institutional changes within government and capitalist society. By
[**shedding any reliance** on discourses of rights]{.underline}, Occupy
arguably **[limited]{.underline}** its [use of **important ideological
resources**]{.underline} in the neoliberal context (Brown 2003; Obando
2014).

It is noteworthy that [many movements]{.underline} inspired by the
Occupy movement--- especially among low-wage workers and advocates for
corporate accountability--- [have **recovered** and **prominently
invoked** rights claims and legal resources]{.underline}. Indeed, [there
has been a recent **convergence** around rights-based claims by
campaigns for a **minimum wage** and **sick pay**]{.underline}, for
[**immigrant rights** and **support**]{.underline}, for **[LBGTQ
rights]{.underline}**, for the **[B]{.underline}**lack
**[L]{.underline}**ives **[M]{.underline}**atter movement,
[and]{.underline} for [other progressive and radical causes]{.underline}
in the United States. [Their reliance on lawyers and litigation has
**varied widely**]{.underline}, [but **none** of these movements
**discount** them]{.underline} as much as did the earlier Occupy
movement. Furthermore, [many grassroots struggles in both the **global
North** and **South**]{.underline}---[against
**apartheid**]{.underline}; [for **indigenous people's
sovereignty**]{.underline}; for socioeconomic entitlements to
**[housing]{.underline}**, **[health-care]{.underline}**,
**[education]{.underline}**, [and **minimum
income**]{.underline}---[also appeal to **legal**]{.underline} or human
[**rights** and rely in part on]{.underline} national or transnational
**[courts]{.underline}** (Haglund and Stryker 2015; Rodriguez-Garavito
2011).

### Link---Liberalism

#### Liberalism is [redeemable]{.underline} and an [efficacious tool]{.underline} for change; rejecting it wholesale is [ivory tower elitism]{.underline}.

**Mills, 21**---former Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at The
Graduate Center, City University of New York (Charles, interviewed by
Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins, "Charles Mills Thinks Liberalism Still Has a
Chance,"
<https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/charles-mills-thinks-theres-still-time-to-rescue-liberalism/>,
dml)

CM: [Liberalism is attractive on both **principled** and **strategic**
grounds]{.underline}. You're completely right, of course, about [the
**failures** of actual historical liberalism]{.underline}, which [are
**manifest**, indeed **ubiquitous**, all around us. But what is the
**source** of these failures? If liberalism has never lived up to
its]{.underline} ostensible principles and [values]{.underline}, [that
**goes no way** in proving that the]{.underline} principles and [values
are **themselves unattractive**]{.underline} ones. [The]{.underline}
illuminating [way to understand these violations of (ideal) liberal
norms]{.underline}, I suggest in the book, [is **not** as the
consequence of an **intrinsically self-undermining** "illiberalizing"
dynamic within liberalism but rather as a manifestation of the
corrupting results of **group power**]{.underline}, whether of the
privileged classes, men, or the dominant race, for liberal theory and
practice. Hence the creation of a bourgeois, patriarchal, or racial
liberalism (usually all three combined, of course).

[But we can appeal to the **idealized**, **non-group-restricted**
versions of liberal principles and values to **critique** the
exclusionary versions]{.underline}---indeed, [that is precisely what
**most**]{.underline} American [**progressive social movements** have
historically done. Particularly at the present time of authoritarian
ethnonationalism's attack on liberal norms, it is **all the more
reason** to affirm them]{.underline}. Moreover, liberalism as I
understand [it is **certainly not committed** to an opposition to
socialism in the social democratic sense]{.underline}---arguably,
**[that's just left-liberalism]{.underline}**. And any other variety of
hypothetical socialism---market socialism, workers' democracy---would
presumably strive to sell itself by promising a deeper and more
extensive realization of liberal values, not their abandonment. So I
would claim that the socialist case can indeed be made within a liberal
framework. It's noteworthy that Rawls---surely a respectable
liberal!---says explicitly in A Theory of Justice that his theory
"includes no natural right of private property in the means of
production."

As for the strategic reasons: [Liberalism]{.underline} (in the
broad-spectrum sense that includes right-wing "classical" liberals)
[has]{.underline} uncontroversially [been the **dominant political
ideology** in US history]{.underline}, albeit in the restrictive
incarnations just delineated. [So in trying to win over a **broad
political audience** rather than **preach to the choir**,
as]{.underline} I presume [progressives **want to do**, one immediately
has the **immense advantage** of invoking the political ideology
nominally endorsed by the majority. You **don't have to require** them
to first **convert** to Marxism or Foucauldian-ism or
whatever]{.underline}; you can just say, "If you're a good liberal, you
should support this." [That **doesn't mean** that you can't get valuable
insights from Marx or Foucault]{.underline}, of course, [but they
are]{.underline} ultimately [going to have to be "**translated**" into a
liberal framework]{.underline}.

And insofar as [legal change will be **crucial for progressive
structural reform**---**necessary** if not **sufficient**---need I make
the **obvious point** that]{.underline} the American and broader Western
[juridical systems are **founded** on liberal principles and
assumptions?]{.underline} The "**[Black radical
liberalism]{.underline}**" I am advocating [will]{.underline} thus [be
able to **engage directly** with its conservative juristic opponents in
a way that nonliberal political ideologies will **not**]{.underline}.
The [Republicans]{.underline} generally, and the Federalist Society
specifically, [are]{.underline} certainly [in **no doubt** themselves
about the importance of fighting for particular interpretations of the
Constitution and the law]{.underline}, which is precisely why they set
out years ago to gain control of the courts. [Black rights]{.underline},
and nonwhite rights in general, [will have to be advanced by **liberal
arguments** and **liberal jurisprudence** in this
**liberal**]{.underline} (in the broad sense) **[arena]{.underline}**.

DSJ: In a retrospective 2015 forum devoted to The Racial Contract in the
journal Politics, Groups, and Identities, you issued a response to your
critics which you entitled "The Racial Contract revisited: still
unbroken after all these years." What do you see as remaining
fundamentally unbroken, and given your commitment to liberalism, what,
if anything, has changed? What gives you hope?

CM: [What I saw as unbroken]{.underline} at the time [was the continuing
reality of **unjust structural white domination**]{.underline} and
unjust structural white advantage, even in the final years of the Obama
presidency. [The racial contract can survive]{.underline} such
[**changes of personnel** in governing circles]{.underline}; [what
**counts**]{.underline}, as I've emphasized throughout, [are the
**structures** and **institutions**]{.underline}. And I should stress
that [liberalism is **not**]{.underline}, in my reading, [**committed**
to the **optimistic**]{.underline} Whig [**progressivism** traditionally
ascribed to it]{.underline}, especially when we need to think of it as
predominantly a racialized liberalism historically.

In my 2015 response, I cited a statistic mentioned by New York Times
columnist Charles Blow that a 2011 survey had revealed that a majority
of white Americans saw themselves as the primary victims of racial
discrimination. Not an encouraging figure! But [even before the Floyd
killing, and before last summer's huge multiracial
demonstrations]{.underline}, such [white racial attitudes]{.underline}
had **[shifted]{.underline}**. So [that]{.underline} is the [kind of
development]{.underline} that [gives me **hope**, along with the
potentiality for]{.underline} the huge [wealth disparities]{.underline}
of the "New Gilded Age" [to create the objective basis for a
**transracial class alliance** of the socially disadvantaged. But a
**nonzero chance of positive racial change**, however small, is
obviously going to be **diminished** even further if one adopts a
**political quietism** predicated on **assuming its hopelessness in
advance**]{.underline}.

### Link---Non-Subject

#### Their embrace of the position of the unthought creates a [philosophical trap]{.underline} where [all revolutionary politics]{.underline} appears [equally suspect]{.underline} because it maintains some idea of a coherent subject\-\--this makes it [impossible]{.underline} to develop radical political communities

Bruno **Bosteels 10**, Professor of Romance Studies at Cornell,
"Politics, Infrapolitics, and the Impolitical: Notes on the Thought of
Roberto Esposito and Alberto Moreiras," *CR: The New Centennial Review*,
Volume 10, Number 2, Fall 2010, pp. 205-238

Already toward the end of Categorie dell\'impolitico , Esposito had
arrived at the conclusion that only a nonsubjective understanding of
politics could keep one at a distance from what Simone Weil would call
\"idolatry.\" This is because the subject as such is through and through
marked by power, or by a will to power in its common pejorative sense.
\"There is no real alternative to power, no subject of antipower, for
the basic reason that the subject is already constitutively power. Or,
in other words, because power is by nature inherent in the dimension of
the subject in the sense that power is precisely its verb,\" writes
Esposito, playing on the active verbal sense of potere or posse as a
power to act, as the capacity of the subject the conclusion to be
extracted from this not only according to Canetti but according to the
whole tradition of impolitical thought, from Broch to Kafka and Simone
Weil- the latter with a blinding clarity- is that the only mode of
containing power is by reducing the subjecť (1999» 20-21; see also 189).
Moreirass proposal for [thinking the political on the basis of what he
calls the \"**nonsubject**]{.underline},\" then, renders explicit what
is already understood to lie at the core of Categorie dell\'impolitico.
The fact that Moreiras recently (2008) devoted a lengthy essay to
Espositos book Terza persona : Politica della vita e filosofia
dell\'impersonale (Third Person: Politics of Life and Philosophy of the
Impersonal) only further highlights this confluence of interest around
the issues of subjectivity and personhood, which these thinkers seek to
de construct in the name of the nonsubject and the impersonal. Referring
more specifically to Žižek and Badious notion of subjectivization as
fidelity to the event, as in the case of Saint Paul s proposition of
love, faith, and hope as the principal virtues of the militant Christian
subject, Moreiras raises the question of the sacrificial cost of all
such processes of fidelity: \"How does an event of truth relate to that
which it leaves behind? If the political is based on the event, what
happens with what is not tied to the event, with the neu tral, without
the nonsubject?\" (2006, 115). The question of the nonsubject, in other
words, [is not a search for an alternative]{.underline}- marginal,
minoritarian, or [counterhegemonic]{.underline}- [subject but an attempt
to **unravel the very logic of all subject-based politics**]{.underline}
[from the point of view of the enigmatic remainder that it necessarily
**produces and excludes at the same time**]{.underline}.

Once again, [we end up with a topology of the **constitutive outside**,
of the excluded other that is inherent in the subjects
self-identity]{.underline}. \"The permanence of the nonsubject within
the subject (the nonsubject: all that which struggles in fidelity
against fidelity, all that which resists conviction, certainty, love)\"
is how Moreiras summarizes his topic of interest. \"[The nonsubject is
that which the subject must constantly subtract in a kind of
self-foundation]{.underline} that extends into virtue (a virtue that the
catechism not coincidentally names or named \'théologal\': faith, love,
and hope are the necessary and sufficient conditions of the absolute
subject of political life, which is also the absolute subject of
spiritual life),\" so that the task of infrapolitics would amount to a
thorough detheologization of politics. \"In other words, what is at
stake is the radical possibility of a detheologized theory of the
political\" (2006, 134). [The real difficulty of this task]{.underline},
however, [stems from the fact that the nonsubject is **not an
alternative entity that can be made to appear**; it is not a remainder
or leftover waiting to be embraced and incorporated]{.underline} into a
new collective identity. [Only **negatively**]{.underline}, or by way of
oblique figures, [can the remainder of all militant subjectivism be
brought to bear upon the definition of the political]{.underline}.
\"[Such a thinking]{.underline}, merely indicative with regard to the
notion of the enigmatic remainder, is both deconstructive and
subalternist: that is to say, its conflictive and polemical virtuality
**[cannot give itself in the positivity of a new proposal of
community]{.underline}**, no new proposal of translative mediation, [no
new proposal of hegemonic or counterhegemonic
articulation\']{.underline} (2006, 150). Through the notion of the
nonsubject, infrapolitics thus puts us on the threshold of a
nonhegemonic perspective whose line of shadow necessarily falls over all
subjectivized politics.

The ultimate target of infrapolitics, thus, is the subject as the
foundation for a politics of militancy. Both communism and liberalism,
as dominant ideologies of the past century and a half, are here
considered mere variants of one and the same politics of
subjectivization. \"The promise of liberalism is the promise of the
antipolitical constitution of a full subject of humanity, without
enemies. Such is also the promise of communism, as the historical
extension of liberalism. The unlimited continuum of modern temporality
closes in on the fissureless constitution of a unique subject- the
subject\" (Moreiras 2006, 76-77). To this metaphysical understanding of
the subject as appropriating plenitude, it is not enough to oppose even
a Derridean politics of friendship. \"Thus, a politics of the
nonsubject, of the enigmatic remainder, committed to the redemption of
the part of those who have no part, is no longer a politics of
friendship, which is only another name for a politics of hegemony\"
(2006, 84; see also Esposito 1999, xxix). Rather and more unexpectedly,
given the radical critique of subjectivization, infrapolitics claims to
be compatible with the kind of politics that no longer requires any
prefixes in the eyes of Rancière: \"The part of those who have no part,
the part that is not, is always the enigmatic remainder, the radical
outside of every possible subject of humanity or for humanity, and thus
the very possibility of a politics beyond the subject- a politics of the
nonsubject that is, perhaps even for Rancière though not explicitly, the
only possible formulation proper to politics\" (Moreiras 2006, 63).

5.wer

I remain convinced that every philosophy that eliminates the category of
the subject becomes unable to serve a political process. (Badiou 2007,
88)

Before an effective politics- and nothing is more irrevocably effective
than a triumphant revolution- which must betray its own idea of justice,
the only possible solution is protected by the ineffective
incorruptibility of the impo litical. (Esposito 1999, 155-56).

We can thus come back to the questions raised in the context of our read
ing of Rancière s Disagreement and ask ourselves in the first place
whether infrapolitics and the impolitical mark- or open the path to- new
forms of politics, or if they rather constitute new perspectives, new
frames of thought, to approach the definition of the political. In other
words, are we dealing with new historical forms of politics or with new
attempts to think the essence of politics? If the latter, then which
historical lessons are taken into account in such attempts? And do the
new frames or perspectives also pretend to open up new forms of politics
to come? Or is the radicalism of the step back toward the political with
its prefixes what guarantees that [any actual form of politics will be
judged a subjectivist illusion, a case of idolatry, or worse, a
hoax?]{.underline} In the end, **[what possibilities remain
open]{.underline}** [when we must at all cost avoid the sacrificial
price of politics as subjective militancy?]{.underline}

To respond to these questions, we can turn to a recent essay on the Span
ish philosopher Maria Zambrano in which Moreiras appears to extrapolate
the infrapolitical conclusions of his book Línea de sombra into a truly
dev astating judgment upon the entire spectrum of political
possibilities from the present and recent past. The article
distinguishes between two types of subjectivity, both of them considered
equally treacherous and metaphysical. The first type is a militancy of
immanence and plenitude, which in turns includes two versions, one
liberal and the other communist:

Subjective militancy is onto theological militancy. There are two
primary ways of it in modernity. In the first way, the militant- formal
subject of a practice of the will- seeks the exhaustive exploitation of
being, the thorough appropriation of being to militant practice. The
subject, as a singular absolute, works on the remainder of its autistic
immanence, thinks of the world as the infinitely reducible, and affirms
its own apotheosis in the closure of world into subject and subject into
world. This is the figure of the liberal subject, which is also the
communist subject: a progressive subject, a subject beyond the shadow of
its own impossibility. (Moreiras 2009, 181).

With the second type of subjectivized politics, on the other hand, we
would seem to be approaching a partial self-criticism, since here
notions of lack, loss, and even, at least implicitly, subalternity are
addressed in ways that seem to refer back to earlier writings by the
same author, even though all such notions are now equated with identity
politics:

In the second way of ontotheological militancy, the militant emphasizes
distance, dwells on the loss through which the subject finds its bliss
through open, painful deconstitution. The subject is here pierced by its
own insufficiency, and must affirm a blind transcendence from that
which, upon giving itself, is lost: from that which gives itself as
loss. This is the reactionary subject, which is also the subject of
personal identity. (Moreiras 2009, 181)

Appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, both types of militancy,
the liberal-communist and the reactionary-identitarian, are considered
paradigmatic cases of a subjectivist tradition of political theology,
from which the infrapolitical orientation seeks to subtract itself. To
do so, however, infrapolitics obviously cannot claim to have access to a
more resolute or originary subject, since this would put us back in the
midst of political theology. In this sense, we might also say that what
Moreiras proposes is a political atheology, which is not the same as a
negative or reactive political theology, as Esposito also explains in a
different context:

In both cases, through both ways, the ontotheological ground of
militancy is a ground because the world appears as an entity regarding
which one must either insist or resist. Through the first militancy,
insistence is a will for saturation: the world will reach proper
totality, will be the One-All as it coalesces with a subject only upon
which a world is possible. In the second militancy, the world is always
already One- All, and the subject experiences it as it experiences its
own expulsion towards nothingness. The world is experienced as possible
through its very withdrawal, appears as an always vanishing horizon, and
it is through this very vanishing that the subject can exercise its own
overwhelming presence: the subject is nothing but a resistance against
nothing, hence the subject is all. (Moreiras 2009, 181-82; compare
Esposito 1999, 298-99)

Infrapolitics and the impolitical in sum propose a double distancing:
both from political theology with its transcendent norm for
representation and from the full immanentism of the subject in the total
biopolitical administration of social identities and their excluded
others, the victims and vanquished of history. \"Double distance- a
distance from reactionary militancy, and a distance from progressive
militantism, a distance from the insistence of subject/world and
resistance to its loss,\" writes Moreiras, \"cannot form a new subject
of the political, but it is the site for the appearance of that which
dwells in the unthought of modern subjectivity. It is the promise of
another constitution of the political\" (2009, 182): the promise, that
is, of a constitution of the political, or of a thinking of the
political, which at last would no longer be sacrificial, militant,
identitarian, subjectivized, or partisan.

Disgraceful is not the priest, but the priest who states that his
kingdom is of this world. If our announcement proclaims values, let our
kingdom not be of this world. If our kingdom is nothing but this world,
then let our language be that of politics without foundation. (Cacciari
2009, 102)

[If it is **difficult to conceive of the passage** from the
philosophical orientations of the impolitical and infrapolitics toward a
new constitution of politics, this is because it seems that **all the
really existing and presently imaginable historical modalities** remain
locked within the horizon of categories marked by
subjectivization]{.underline}, militancy, decisionism, or
representation. This is at the same time the strength and the weakness
of the orientations in question. If I may be allowed to play on the last
names of Esposito and Moreiras, we could say that [infrapolitics and the
impolitical leave politics \"exposed\" to its own finitude while letting
the subject \"die\" or \"dwell\" in its mortality]{.underline}. By
contrast, **[any attempt actually to transform what is thus exposed and
delimited]{.underline}** [falls necessarily in the trap of a
metaphysical illusion of the infinite powers of the
subject]{.underline}. What is more, any objection against the limited
projectuality of the respective proposals of infrapolitics and the
impolitical is always already preemptively taken into account and
refuted, insofar as the aim of these proposals is precisely to render
inoperative all such criteria of projectuality, regardless of their
ideological orientation. In L origine della politica ( lhe Origin of
Politics), Esposito draws a fine distinction in this respect between
Arendt and Weil. Whereas the former still hopes to revitalize an
alternative origin for politics, other than its perceived enmeshment
with the factuality of power and war, for the latter politics and war
are inseparable so that [the thing to do is not dialectically to
overcome war by means of a regrounded politics but rather to reinterpret
politics from the impolitical perspective of its shadowy
reverse]{.underline}. \"No longer to reconstruct the devastated space of
politics but to uncover its hidden \'impolitical' soul,\" suggests
Esposito. If Weil on rare occasions seems to be optimistic about the
possibility of an alternative art of the political, this does not mean
that the impolitical perspective becomes practicable: \"Even in these
cases, however, the positive evaluation of politics is always
conditioned by its being rooted in a point that is external and
transcendent to it - thus altogether inoperative \" (1996, 16).

And yet, curiously enough, the arguments for thinking the inoperativity
of the political in the name of finitude, even if the latter does not
amount to a new value and despite the apparent reserve in the style of
argumentation, never cease to invoke the proximity with the Nietzschean
idea of a "grand politics" or with an almost "ultrapolitical"
radicalism. This is the case, most obviously, in Cacciari's original
essay on "Nietzsche and the Unpolitical," but Esposito, too, not only in
Categorie dell'impolitico but also and even more explicitly so in Bíos:
Biopolitics and Philosophy, offers what we might call an impolitical
transvaluation of "grand politics" in the direction of the paradigm of
autoimmunity (2008, 78--109), just as Moreiras, in the announcement for
the conference "New Paths in Political Philosophy" where I first
presented some of the ideas for these notes, expresses the hope that
"the notion of a 'grand' academic politics in the Nietzschean sense
might be allowed here." How then do we move from infrapolitics and the
impolitical to die grosse Politik in Nietzsche's sense? Or, conversely,
how can a Nietzschean-styled grand politics possibly be read as being
already impolitical or infrapolitical rather than ultra- or
overpolitical, as after all we might have expected coming from the
philosopher of the Uebermensch?

The key to understanding this move consists in grasping the point at
which Nietzsche's radical critique of all hitherto existing politics,
far from implying the affirmation of an alternative value, actually
presupposes the complete emptying of all political valorization. As
Cacciari writes:

The unpolitical does not represent the value that frees itself from the
nonvalue of the political, but the radical critique of the political as
invested with value. The unpolitical is the reversal of value. And only
this reversal can liberate the will to power in the direction of
politics on a grand scale. Grand politics are not possible there where
the critique of the unpolitical is limited to affirming the necessity of
politicization. This affirmation is still historicism, tradition. Grand
politics is a critique of the values that still form the basis of this
politicization. (2009, 95)

Nietzsche's grand politics is not the heroic moment after the nihilistic
disenchantment of all hitherto existing values, but the moment of
nihilistic destruction already coincides with grand politics once the
latter is read in an unpolitical or impolitical key: "The unpolitical
brings the political back to the acknowledgement of its intrinsic
nihilism. This key direction opens up, above all, by attacking the
concepts, the forms, and the conducts that are the substance of the
political as value. But this very same pars destruens is already a
construction of grand politics insofar as it is a nihilistic
devaluation" (2009, 96). Paradoxically, therefore, it is not so much the
will to power or the affirmation of the eternal return but a certain
measure of inaction that defines Nietzsche as an impolitical
philosopher. "If it turns out to be impossible to interpret Nietzsche
because his primary feature is precisely to deground or make flounder
any possible hermeneutic in its own subtraction from all meaning, it is
much more unthinkable to attempt a 'realization' of his thought, because
he contains no theory of action whatsoever and even presents himself
provocatively as a theory or rather a practice of inaction," writes
Esposito. "Nietzsche the philosopher of inaction is the philosopher of
the impolitical" (1999, 282).

Badiou, interestingly enough, offers a very different reading of
Nietzsche's grand politics, one that can furthermore serve as a useful
contrast for the framing of our overarching questions about the relation
between politics and thought and between philosophy and history. Badiou
first of all proposes to link the idea of grand politics to concrete
historico-political events such as the French Revolution and the Paris
Commune. Nietzsche relates to these events according to a logic of
rivalry and mimeticism. To be more precise, he absorbs the explosive
energy of the historico-political revolution into the realm of the
philosophical act. "The philosophical act is in fact represented by
Nietzsche as an amplified mimetics of the revolutionary event," Badiou
claims. "Nietzsche adopts with regard to the revolutionary act a rapport
of formal fascination and substantive repulsion. He proposes for himself
to render formally equivalent the philosophical act as an act of thought
and the apparent explosive power of the politico-historical revolution"
(1994, 10--11). [The result is a **philosophical appropriation of the
revolutionary act**, which can present itself not only as capable of
breaking the history of the world in two]{.underline}, like dynamite
with a before and an after, [but also as being far more radical than any
**really existing revolutionary process**]{.underline}. Th is is why
Nietzsche's grand politics, rather than receiving an impolitical or
unpolitical slant, can be seen as an example of what Badiou calls
"archipolitics," which is also diff erent from the way this term is
defined in Rancière. "The philosophical act is, I would say,
archipolitical, in that [it proposes itself to revolutionize all of
humanity on a more radical level than that of the calculations of
politics]{.underline}," Badiou explains. "It is the philosophical act
itself that is archipolitical, in the sense that its historical
explosion will show, retroactively, that the political revolution
properly speaking has not been truthful, or has not been authentic"
(1994, 11). Badiou's reading of Nietzsche thus restores not only a
certain historicity but also a profound ambivalence to the peculiar
articulation of thought and politics that goes by the name of "grand
politics." Far from merely devaluing politics, this articulation both
validates and depreciates what we have come to understand under this
term. Most importantly, by [absorbing the violent break of revolutionary
politics into the characterization of the philosophical act
proper]{.underline}, archipolitics [allows the philosopher]{.underline}
of the overman [to portray himself as infinitely more radical than any
existing politics]{.underline}.

Could we not conclude that the points of view of infrapolitics and the
impolitical are also archipolitical in the sense outlined in Badiou's
reading of Nietzsche? This would be confirmed by a long quotation
attributed to Karl Jaspers via Georges Bataille in Esposito's Categorie
dell'impolitico, according to which Nietzsche's interest in grand
politics, though inspired and conditioned by concrete empirical
activities, at the same time can claim to operate at an ontological
level that will always be more originary than any given political event.
Th is is because the explosive event produced by politics in the grand
style is aimed at the totality of being, and not just at the mere
administration of public affairs. Quoting Jaspers in a French
translation most likely made by Pierre Klossowski, Bataille writes the
following about Nietzsche:

He establishes the origin of the political event, without plunging
methodically into the concrete particular realities of political
activity, such as it manifests itself every day in the struggle among
powers and peoples. He wants to engender a movement that would awaken
the last foundations (the final causes) of the human being and with his
thinking force those who listen and understand him to enter into this
movement, without the content of this movement having received any
statist, populist or sociological determination whatsoever. The content
that determines all judgments is rather for Nietzsche the "integral"
attitude with regard to the totality of being; it is no longer only
politics but philosophy by means of which, in the abundance of the
possible and without rational principle, the contrary and contradictory
can be attempted---in an attempt that obeys only the principle of
salvation and gradation of the human condition. (quoted in Esposito
1999, 283--84)

Similarly, I would argue, [infrapolitics and the
impolitical]{.underline} can lay claims to being forms of grand politics
because they too [**absorb the radicality of the historico-political
break**, now rendered inoperative, into the realm of
philosophy]{.underline}---**[into the thought of the
political]{.underline}**. In fact, [the very **impossibility of the
dialogue** between politics and philosophy]{.underline}, or between the
real and the thought of the real, which is due to the unrepresentability
of conflict within political philosophy, [seems to take the place
otherwise occupied by conflict as it traditionally operates in the realm
of politics.]{.underline} [What such a substitution gains in terms of
philosophical radicality, it **gives up in terms of political
effectiveness**]{.underline}. For Esposito and Moreiras, however, this
does not signal a loss or a defeat so much as it is the inevitable
outcome of a willful act of renunciation: a will not to will. In the
end, [theirs is a strange kind of passive decision]{.underline}, or a
decision in favor of passivity and inaction, [this being the only remedy
against the deafening calls for political activism and
operativity]{.underline}.

### Link---Posthumanism

#### Their ethical openness actively sanctifies violence

**Emden, 17**---Professor of German Intellectual History and Political
Thought at Rice University (Christian, "Normativity Matters:
Philosophical Naturalism and Political Theory," *The New Politics of
Materialism: History, Philosophy, Science*, Chapter 12, google books, no
page numbers, dml)

[Braidotti's account highlights the **political pitfalls** of a
posthumanist ethics that **pays little heed** to the problem of
**normativity** and **even less attention** to questions of
**justiﬁcation**. The ethical stance adopted by a **broad range** of
posthumanist interventions]{.underline}---from new materialism to the
farthest reaches of speculative realism, or object-oriented
ontology---[is either **unsurprising** or **banal**: human
exceptionalism is **overrated**, **indeed**, and the arbitrary
exploitation of both human and nonhuman animals is **questionable on
several fronts**]{.underline}.22 [**Few will disagree** with such
claims, but relegating the question of normativity **into the
background** also leads to a conception of ethics, and politics, that is
**devoid of any real normative import**.]{.underline} On such an
account, [something simply becomes ethical **as soon as it becomes a
subject of concern**, and while our environment]{.underline}---from
genes to entire habitats---[certainly can be an ethical concern, **not
everything** that can become a concern raises questions of an ethical
nature]{.underline}.23 [While it is certainly the case that our ethical
responsibilities---as far as we can still speak of the latter in
consequentialist terms as real responsibilities---**cannot seriously be
limited** to other human animals, it is **not entirely unproblematic**
to **reduce the question of ethics** to the **simple experience of an
encounter** with others, human and nonhuman alike, that highlights to us
**nothing more** than the "subtle involvements and relations between
more-than-just-human beings]{.underline}" (Smith 2011, xviii). [If
ethics is really supposed to consist in an activist and creative
interaction with others that **precludes moral judgment**, it does
become **devoid of any normative relevance** and tends toward a
**romanticizing aestheticization of the other**]{.underline}.24 [Such a
romanticizing stance particularly comes to the fore when posthumanism
**takes on environmentalist concerns**]{.underline} but replaces, for
instance, arguments about marine pollution with a poetic description of
deep-sea life whose main contention is that, somehow, we are all of
oceanic origins.25 [**Real** and **justiﬁed concerns** about **global
warming** are another prominent example for such an ethical stance, but
if the posthumanist thesis]{.underline} of a ﬂat monist ontology [**does
indeed hold water**, there is **no reason** to assume that global
warming is not **simply part of the system**, as it were]{.underline}.26

From a political perspective, [ﬂat monist ontologies lead to a
**diffusion of responsibility** which ultimately **turns against** those
posthumanist interventions that, in the name of emancipation, seek to
hold a modern, humanist subjectivity responsible for **gender
inequality**, **factory livestock farming**, **global warming**, and the
**ills of neoliberal capitalism**]{.underline}.27 In the end, it might
even be the case, as Bennett (2015) suggested most recently, that new
materialism would have "to forego the category of the political as such"
(84). Although this might be pressing the point too far, [it **might not
be possible anymore** to **differentiate** between]{.underline}, say,
[the **production of udon noodles** and **presidential elections**, and
if that should really be the case, then the demands of posthumanism and
new materialism might neither be **ethically**, nor **politicially**,
**relevant**]{.underline}.

While the consequences of posthumanism's and new materialism's ethical
stance thus appear questionable by their own standards, [what is at
stake is **not simply a lack of theoretical coherence**]{.underline}.
Rather, [in the background of political pitfalls and ethical vagueness
stands a **more serious philosophical problem**]{.underline}, that of
the naturalistic fallacy. For any posthumanist or new materialist
ethics, [the naturalistic fallacy proves **fatal**]{.underline}. This
problem becomes particularly obvious in a central claim---summarized in
exemplary fashion by Karen Barad---that shapes [the ethical and
political outlook of posthumanism and new materialism at
large]{.underline}. Relating the agency of matter directly to the
question of ethics, Barad draws on Emmanuel Levinas' understanding of
ethics as a ﬁrst philosophy grounded in the immediate phenomenological
experience of encountering "the other." The other, Levinas (1969)
[argues]{.underline}, is revealed in its "alterity" to the "I" and thus
creates an "irreducible relationship" that is centered on our immediate
response to the other, which he understands as the basis of ethical
responsibility (150 and 7980). While Levinas is far from being a
materialist philosopher, he does suggest that [our relationship to the
"material world" can]{.underline}, in principle, [repeat the structural
logic of "I" and "the other]{.underline}": "The primordial relation of
man with the material world is not negativity, but enjoyment and
agreeableness of life," and it is this move that allows Barad (1996) to
translate Levinas' theologically oriented assumptions into her account
of an "ethics of mattering"(Levinas 1969, 49; and Barad 1996, 391---96).
Ethics emerges in the agential dynamics inherent in matter, which
includes the human subject as constituted by its material agency. [As a
consequence, "the human subject is not the locus of ethicality," but
ethical relationships are **always part of the agency of matter**.
Ethics]{.underline}, then, [is **not really concerned with norms** but
rather with the "**relationalities of becoming** of which we are a
part"]{.underline} (Barad 1996, 393). While it might certainly be
possible to describe the emergence of normativity along these lines,
[Barad goes much further, concluding that **all material agency** is
**essentially of an ethical kind**, since "\[m\]atter itself is **always
already open to**, or rather **entangled with**, the
'**Other**"']{.underline} (393). Since all material agency is
reciprocal, in one way or another, it does "respond" to other kinds of
agency, and since agency thus entails "the ability to respond to the
other," Barad deﬁnes "responsibility" in terms of responsiveness (392).

Short-circuiting Levinas' theological ethics of the other with the
monist ontology of new materialism ultimately gives rise to metaphysical
claims that withdraw from justiﬁcation: "A delicate tissue of ethicality
runs through the marrow of being. There is no getting away from
ethics---mattering is an integral part of the ontology of the world in
its dynamic presencing" (Barad 1996, 396). Of course, [if **everything
is somehow ethical** as long as it is concerned with material agency,
then **any ethical claim** could potentially be accepted: **human
cruelty** might just be an **agential manifestation** "intrinsic to the
world's vitality," and the **agents of cruelty** might very well merely
be "**responsive to the possibilities that might help \[them\]
ﬂourish**," since they are, after all, "alive to the possibilities of
becoming"]{.underline} (396).

### Link---Queerness---Assemblages

#### Their totalizing rejection of identity [prevents]{.underline} collective solidarity based on ideas of a common human subject.

**Latchford, 14**---Associate Professor in the School of Gender,
Sexuality and Women's Studies at York University in Toronto (Frances,
"Unidentified Remains: The Impolitics of Non-Identity", Atlantis 36.2,
2014, dml)

Just like Michel Foucault, [queer theory has always regarded identity
with **deep suspicion** and it upholds this aversion as an **antidote**
that **redresses the constraints** posed by the subject]{.underline},
ones that various feminist, critical race, and lesbian and gay identity
politics are said to leave intact (Ryan 2001, 325-326; Ford 2007,
479-482).2 [Queer theory enlists]{.underline} [Foucault's]{.underline}
[politics of non-identity]{.underline}, and variations thereof, [to
**ferret out** and **undo the limits of the subject**]{.underline} so
that you might "cease to be imprisoned in your own face, in your own
past, in your own identity" (Miller 1993, 264). [The distrust of
identity that drives queer theory is **so ingrained** that it often
**turns its suspicion back in on itself** in that even "**queer
anti-identity narratives**" are now located, for instance
by]{.underline} Jasbir **[Puar]{.underline}** (2007), [on the same
"continuum that **privileges the pole of identity** as the evolved form
of Western modernity"]{.underline} (222). Queer practices of
non-identity, it turns out, are just as vulnerable to (re) presenting
the subject through homonationalist re-territorializations that
institute queer non-identity as an identity politic after all.3 Turned
back on itself, [queer theory's mistrust of identity politics has lead
it to take up the **politics of assemblage** and to **pursue identity's
collapse**:]{.underline} with a "cacophony of informational flows,
energetic intensities, bodies, and practices that undermine coherent
identity and even queer anti-identity narratives" (222), "to conceive
the pure experience, event and dramatization of many sexes without
falling back onto the ontological constitution of queer sexuality"
(Parisi 2009, 72), [by "opening up to the **fantastical wonders of
futurity**" and **affect** to resist forces that **rationalize
identities** into **finite** and **narrow existence**]{.underline} (Puar
2007, 222), [and to **evade "singularity"** in favour of "collectivity,
imagination and a kind of situationist commitment to surprise and
shock"]{.underline} (**[Halberstam]{.underline}** 2011, 29).4 As a
result, [queer Deluezean approaches]{.underline} also demonstrate the
deep suspicion of identity that reverberates throughout queer theory and
Foucauldian approaches; as Chrysanthi Nigianni and Merl Storr (2009)
explain, Deleuzean approaches [set out to "**queer the queer**" by
circumventing the question of (non-)identity, because they are "not just
against this or that particular identity as not being politically
useful, but **against the very concept of identity** and the thinking it
engenders]{.underline}" (5).5

Where queer theory more recently engages Gilles Delueze to undercut the
influence of Foucault's politics of non-identity, as an identity
politic, the similarity of purpose to which both philosophers have been
put is uncanny, because it was always with "flows," "intensities,"
"bodies," "practices," and new "pleasures," or affect, that queer
theories set out, originally with Foucault, to disrupt the trap of
identity. To this extent, [the **suspicion of identity** with which
queer theory, **like a reflex**, **turns on itself again** and
**again**, must also demand, if it hasn't already, this **inevitable
conclusion**: the queer politics of assemblage **recreates the same
problems** of (non-)identity]{.underline} that Deleuze is used to dodge,
for instance, via the claim that queer non-identity is penetrated by the
pole of identity.

To illustrate, consider for a moment that [the opposition of queer
assemblages against queer non-identity to reduce the latter to identity
politics, by virtue of being a non-identity politics, really is a
(queer) critique to which **assemblage is susceptible too**. Queer
assemblage politics sets out to "escape\[s\] the traditional strategy of
negation]{.underline} (queer as the non-, anti-, contra-)" [and thereby
avert the binary thought it locates in queer non-identity politics; it
claims to do so because it avoids questions of (non-)identity
altogether]{.underline} (Nigianni and Storr 2009, 2). This is the appeal
of [Deleuzian approaches]{.underline} to queer theory: they [appear to
avoid]{.underline} the [binary thinking]{.underline} that anti-identity
politics, as such, find unavoidable. The logic behind a queer move to
avoidance, Margaret Shildrick (2009) explains, is that it is only when
"queer theory explicitly intervenes in the parameters of social
exclusion," for instance, as anti-identity politics must, that queer
theory "to an extent must always reiterate binary thinking in order to
contest it" (129; emphasis added).6

However, [the strategic avoidance of identity can be **exposed as just
as much of a negation** as any explicit rejection of identity because
queer theorists]{.underline}, like myself, [are **groomed from the
outset** to be **on the lookout** for identity everywhere; the only
difference between the two is that an avoidance is a **covert mode of
rejection** that is **implicit**, **subterranean**, and
**passive**]{.underline}---like centers and margins, the explicit and
implicit are extant co-operatives in negation, even if they "cannot be
naturalised as 'having always existed'" (Deleuze qtd. in Conley 2009,
26). [So **regardless of the opacity** of its anti-identity strategy,
queer assemblage politics can also be **placed on a continuum** with
queer non-identity politics; it is **just as buggered** by the pole of
identity if and when queer theory renders it suspect]{.underline}, as I
have here. Moreover, [as long as the suspicion of identity is **allowed
to remain totalizing** in queer theory, queer theory is going to **eat
its tail**]{.underline}. All of which causes me to say that [queer
theory really needs to **ask a different question**: is identity
**precisely the problem** that faces queer theory or is it the
**rejection of identity**, as **queer reflex**, that **poses today's
greatest threat to queers**?]{.underline}

[This]{.underline} paper [responds to]{.underline} what I think is [the
**largely uncritical belief** that operates implicitly and
explicitly]{.underline} throughout queer theory: it is the belief [that
identity politics **must always be rejected**]{.underline}. As Hiram
Perez (2005) observes, "a great deal of queer theorizing has sought to
displace identity politics with an alternative anti-identitarian model,"
one he also challenges, because it conflates queerness uncritically and
too often with a "race-neutral objectivity" (172). The central claim in
this paper is that [queer theory's **totalizing rejection of identity**
is **socially** and **politically incautious**]{.underline}; and since
[queer praxes of non-identity and assemblage]{.underline} are on a
continuum in that both are suspicious of identity politics, this essay
makes no attempt to differentiate between them---they [are **equally
anti-identitarian**]{.underline}.7 It argues that [it is a **mistake**
to think that either identity or anti-identity politics, solely, is
**fitting in every context** that demands a social-political
response]{.underline}. It also demonstrates that [**a balance must be
struck** between identity politics and queer politics that intends to
**interrupt the subject** and **visibility politics**]{.underline}.

### Link---Queerness---State-Phobia

#### The aff's state-phobia destroys their attempt at radical politics -- their critique of white homonormativity devolves into a flippant rejection of all legal protections, taking the subject position of the European queer as a presumed universal and reifying the worst Eurocentric violence. Instead, we should move against state-phobia while remaining wary of the anti-racist critique of legal recognition, producing a superior politics able to contingently engage with legal and policy reform without sacrificing the radicality of the 1AC. 

**Dhawan 15.** Nikita Dhawan, professor of political science at the
University of Innsbruck (Austria), "Homonationalism and state-phobia:
The post-colonial predicament of queering modernities, publication
forthcoming, available via Academia.edu, 62

**[One of my main difficulties with current politics of
anti-homonationalism and pink-watching is their rejection of any
engagement with the state, which is censured as a form of co-option and
appeasement]{.underline}**. [They]{.underline} almost [seem to
**oppose** the political agenda of providing non-normative sexualities
with social recognition and **legal protection through rights and
policies**]{.underline}, because **[this would mean acknowledging the
existence of other forms of violence that are not reducible to Western
racism and imperialism even as they are not entirely disconnected from
them]{.underline}**. **[This form of anti-statism denies others some of
the protections postcolonial queers enjoy on the privileged side of
transnationality, who live in states where homosexuality has been
decriminalized]{.underline}**. Anyone who addresses the issue of
homophobia in minority cultures is simply racist and any talk of
homophobic violence causes trouble for sexual minorities in their
communities or countries. **[Anyone who supports ideals of equality,
freedom, or emancipation is labeled 'Western']{.underline}** or
functions as a trophy for liberal and conservative forces. My response
to this position is that **[they do not take the consequences of
colonialism seriously if they think decolonization is simply
circumventing the legacies of modernity and the language of rights,
equality, freedom and emancipation]{.underline}**.

While theorists like Puar rightly draw on Foucault to unpack how
non-normative sexualities are deployed in the biopolitical production of
different populations in relation to one another, namely, how European
queers are constituted in terms of requiring protection from the threat
of homophobic migrants at home and regressive Muslim cultures elsewhere.
At the same time, [one of my primary objects against Puar and the
politics of anti-homonationalism is that **they tend to dehistoricize,
demonize and essentialize the state reducing it to its penal
functions**]{.underline}. [In her discussions of Israeli 'pink-washing'
or decriminalization of homosexuality]{.underline} in India, [Puar gives
the impression **'as if '** there is **no difference between the US and
Germany**, or between **Israel and India**]{.underline}. **[This
dangerously disregards Foucault's critique of
state-phobia]{.underline}** in his governmentality lectures, wh[ere he
simultaneously **targets Marxists, ultra-left radicals, liberals,
neo-liberals**, which consider the state as predator that must be
contained and 'defanged']{.underline} (refer to Dhawan 2013).
**[Rejecting Nietzsche's image of the state as the 'coldest of all cold
monsters', Foucault views the state an effect rather than cause of
governmental practices and rationalities.]{.underline}**

Foucault's historical investigations unfold how [the experience with
fascism und totalitarianism during National Socialism and Stalinism led
to the rise of state-phobia]{.underline} in Europe. In order to
reconfigure the relation between government and society, the subsequent
efforts sought to replace the despotic state or police state through
rule of law and constitutional state. According to Foucault, [since the
late 1970s anti-statism rapidly became the basis of liberal and left
politics in the form of critique of securitization and repressive
apparatus]{.underline}. [This translated for instance into uncritical
solidarity with soviet dissidents]{.underline}. **[Both amongst the
liberals as well as amongst the left, the idea of state as threat gained
traction]{.underline}**, particularly in the context of fear of atomic
war. **[Foucault problematizes the state-phobia of liberal as well as
left politics]{.underline}**, in [that they **fail to distinguish**
between **administrative** state]{.underline}, [**welfare**
state]{.underline}, [**bureaucratic** state]{.underline}, [**fascist**
state and totalitarian state]{.underline}. He distances himself from
such an inflationary form of liberal and left state- phobia. In contrast
[Foucault understands **the state as 'the mobile effect of a regime of
multiple governmentalities' that overlap, but also contradict each
other**]{.underline} (2008: 77).

**[This dynamic and ambivalent function of the state is dangerously
ignored by scholars like Puar]{.underline}**, [whose critique of the
state **gravitates towards state-phobia** in that **every attempt by
queer individuals and groups to negotiate with the state is denounced as
homonationalism**]{.underline}. One must bear in mind that **[there is a
very fine line between critique of the state and state- phobia and
anti-statism]{.underline}**. [The latter is marked by a **deep distrust
of state institutions per se**]{.underline}. As Foucault compellingly
argues, [state-phobia forms a **foundational premise** for the emergence
of **neoliberal governmentality** and **conflates critique of state and
critique of domination**, with the state being characterized as the
origin of all violence]{.underline}.

**[The challenge for postcolonial queer theory is to formulate critique
of the state and critique of hegemonic heteronormativity without
reproducing state-phobia]{.underline}**. Finally **[liberal and left
state-phobia is informed by a Eurocentrism]{.underline}**, in that [a
particular, specific European experience with fascism is universalized
thereby erasing different historical processes of state-formation and
state-building in postcolonial contexts]{.underline}. [Puars critique of
USA, Israel und India **homogenizes very diverse anti-discrimination
policies** and laws simply as politics of appeasement]{.underline}.
**[This approach is risky in its simplicity]{.underline}**.
Interestingly states like Saudi Arabia or Mauritania, where homosexual
acts are punishable with death penalty are spared in Puar's writings.
Moreover, [she equates the provisional decriminalization of same sex
acts in India and invalidation of sodomy laws in USA as examples of
homonationalism, discounting the differences between two very different
historical and regional contexts]{.underline}. **[The two legal reforms
are a result of complex social and legal struggles that produce
ambivalent and diverse effects]{.underline}**, which are questionably
disregarded. **[If Europe universalized its norms and epistemologies
through colonialism, then decolonization is incomplete without the
deuniversalization and provincialization of Euro-American experiences
and politics]{.underline}**. This would entail a nuanced historical
analysis of diverse configurations. [In this context the specific German
experience with fascism and totalitarianism must not be imposed
seamlessly on post- colonial contexts to promote a transnational
state-phobic queer politics. This would be disastrous]{.underline}.

### Link---Racial Capitalism

#### The history of organizing against racial capitalism proves the necessity of advocating for pragmatic reform and concrete gains through [institutions]{.underline}.

**Mishler, 20**---Assistant Professor of History at the University of
Toronto (Max, "Thomas G. Young, Black Pragmatism, and the Routes of
Social Democracy in New York City," Social History, Volume 53, Number
108, October 2020, pp. 223-255, dml) \[language modifications denoted by
brackets\]

For nearly 45 years, Young cultivated [a **pragmatic**
approach]{.underline} to the trade union and civil rights movements. He
[coordinated **general strikes** and]{.underline} occasionally endorsed
**[armed self-defence]{.underline}** among workers, [but]{.underline} he
[**refused to reify** radical tactics and believed]{.underline}
passionately in the power of **[reform-oriented bureaucratic
institutions]{.underline}** like Local 32B to improve the lives of
working people. Indeed, he concluded that trade unions
[were]{.underline} one of the few organizations [capable of **sustaining
long-term progressive social movements** and **alleviating the miseries
of capitalism**]{.underline}. Young's lifelong, unequivocal loyalty to
Local 32B reflected a unique political outlook that was cultivated in
response to contingent historical events and an ever-changing balance of
forces. The long arc of his career vividly illustrates the dialectical
relationship between moral principles and institutional power that
animates the history of many social movements.5

Thomas Young's "elastic" approach to the class struggle exemplifies [an
**important strain** of]{.underline} American pragmatism, a distinct
mode of [Black politics forged out of **quotidian struggles** against
racial capitalism]{.underline} during the 1930s and 1940s.6 There
[was]{.underline}, of course, [a **long tradition of
pragmatism**]{.underline} in the labour movement associated with Samuel
Gompers and Adolph Strasser, who once told a Congressional committee,
"We have no ultimate ends \... [we fight]{.underline} only [for
**immediate objects**]{.underline}, objects [that can be realized in a
**few years**]{.underline}.7 " There was also [a **vibrant socialist
tendency**]{.underline} that [**renounced** revolution in favour of
using the tools of **liberal democracy** to **rein in** the power of
capital]{.underline}. Though less developed in the United States,
democratic socialism won many converts at the turn of the twentieth
century.8 An alternate, Black radical tradition preceded both Gompers
and Eugene V. Debs. Since at least the eighteenth century, [African
Americans developed a **range** of political practices conducive to
**survival**]{.underline}, **[self-determination]{.underline}**, [and
**social mobility** in societies where White supremacy rendered Black
insurrection]{.underline} suicidal \[**[untenable]{.underline}**\].9
Following the Civil War and Reconstruction, Booker T.
**[Washington]{.underline}**, Ida B. **[Wells]{.underline}**, and W. E.
B. **[DuBois]{.underline}**, [among **many others**]{.underline},
[sought **practical solutions** to]{.underline} the problems of
**[racial terror]{.underline}**, **[poverty]{.underline}**, [and
**second-class citizenship**]{.underline}.10 [A **diverse array** of
African American activists took up the mantle of
**pragmatism**]{.underline} during the twentieth century.11

Gomperism, democratic socialism, and Black realpolitik all informed
Young's political philosophy. His early activism revolved around the
Socialist Party and grassroots efforts to organize building service
workers into Local 32B. Like other Black socialists, Young believed that
Black workers would find deliverance through [interracial trade
unions]{.underline} because these [were]{.underline} the only
institutions [capable of **constraining** the power of
capital]{.underline}, [**eroding** American racism and delivering
**human emancipation**]{.underline}.12 His [experience as an
organizer]{.underline} and trade-union leader, however, led him to
[prioritize **short-term**]{.underline}, [**concrete victories** over
**revolutionary transformation**]{.underline}. [The point of **militant
collective action**]{.underline}, Young concluded, [was to build
**institutions** capable of **wrenching concessions** from wealthy
employers at the bargaining table and powerful enough to **pressure
politicians** into **supporting workers**]{.underline} on the picket
line [or passing **nondiscrimination legislation**]{.underline}. A
champion of gradual "economic and political advancement" over what he
perceived to be radical "rabble rousing," he was nevertheless in the
vanguard of "civil rights unionism."13

Young's political evolution corresponded with the rise of a New Deal
order that legitimated trade unions and introduced the idea of social
citizenship into American politics.14 He was one among many activists
who turned to President FranklinD. Roosevelt's administration and the
New Deal state to solve the problems of entrenched economic and racial
inequality. By [the]{.underline} late 1930s, Young's
**[pragmatic]{.underline}**, **[state-centered approach]{.underline}**
to the labour and civil rights movements epitomized what I call Black
social democracy.15 This political project [offered a **trenchant
critique** of racial capitalism that **eschewed** both communist
internationalism and Black nationalist programs]{.underline}. [Black
social democrats embraced the New Deal **despite** its many shortcomings
and exclusions because it opened up a **new terrain of struggle** and
established **novel institutional mechanisms**]{.underline}, such as the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), that bolstered the power of
organized labour. While no social-democratic party similar to those in
England or Canada emerged in the United States, the New Deal represented
a distinctly American social democratic horizon of possibility for
nearly two decades. In this context, "socialism" receded from Young's
political vocabulary amid a new confidence in the redistributive
possibilities of American politics. Two signature victories in 1945
cemented his faith in the radical potential of liberal democracy.

The nascent Cold War, however, soon curtailed the expansive vision of
social citizenship articulated during the New Deal and blunted the power
of organized labour. Both communist and non-communist labour leaders
found themselves in the cross-hairs of conservative political opponents,
and even those trade unions that purged Communists from their ranks and
supported US foreign policy had to adopt to a repressive political
context. Young's metamorphosis into a "militant mediator" during the
1950s reflected [a **pragmatic response** to political repression and an
**acute awareness** of **liberalism's redistributive**]{.underline},
**[progressive possibilities]{.underline}**.16 He never abandoned a
social-democratic vision rooted in the labour movement, however, and
[continued to win **tangible benefits for thousands**]{.underline} of
working-class New Yorkers. The scope of his activism even expanded
beyond the trade union movement to encompass affordable housing, quality
health care, and penal reform. Young's trajectory in the arena of
electoral politics, however, started to diverge sharply from that of
fellow Black social democrats such as A. Phillip Randolph or Maida
Springer. While many of his comrades remained firmly embedded in the
Democratic Party, Young found a political home in the liberal wing of
the Republican Party for over two decades.

My aim in this article is to explain how a Black socialist became a
Black Republican while remaining a lifelong trade union and civil rights
activist. The answer lies in Young's distinguished career as an
organizer dedicated to building 32B into a powerful trade union.17
Rather than tell Young's story as a declension narrative from socialist
militant to reactionary comprador, I show how his lifelong [struggle to
improve the lives of working people within the confines of racial
capitalism produced a **pragmatic praxis** worthy of a place in the
pantheon of **Black political strategies**]{.underline}. Indeed,
[institutions that provide **material relief** and a platform for
**sustained struggle** are an **integral part** of the Black radical
tradition]{.underline}, **[even if they are not insurrectionary or
millenarian]{.underline}**.18 Thomas Young's politics fit squarely
within the broader history of twentieth-century Black radicalism.19
Ultimately, the story of **[Black social democracy]{.underline}** in New
York City [offers **instructive lessons**]{.underline} for contemporary
activists eager [to **translate protest into power**]{.underline}.20

### Link---Radical Subjectivity

#### Using debate to generate new revolutionary subjectivities [Eurocentrically devalues]{.underline} the revolutions happening [every day]{.underline}.

**Nayar, 17**---associate professor and director of the International
Development Law and Human Rights LLM Program at the School of Law,
University of Warwick (Jayan, "Some Thoughts on the "(Extra)Ordinary":
Philosophy, Coloniality, and Being Otherwise," Alternatives: Global,
Local, Political, Vol 42, Issue 1, 2017, dml) \[language modifications
denoted by brackets\]

[Eruptions of **anger** and **refusal**]{.underline}, [of **bodies
emergent** onto the street]{.underline}, of voice and song and chants,
[and of **dreams articulated** against the decadent normalities of the
present]{.underline}, these indeed are important occasions of
celebration which remind History of the utter unpredictability of
futures regardless of presents however seemingly entrenched they might
be. These [are **thrilling**]{.underline} events no doubt; they portend
passage often, and importantly so at that. [But]{.underline} this said,
the significant [pathways of decoloniality are **not charted** by these
moments of the street]{.underline}, [they are **laid before** and
**travelled hence**]{.underline}, [after the thrill has
gone]{.underline}, so to speak,56 in the everyday revolutions "to create
new social relationships, as Raul Zibech reminds us." I argue that it is
precisely [this]{.underline} necessary actuality of being-otherwise that
[is **missed** by Eurocentric philosophers in their quests for the
**extraordinary**]{.underline} resurrection of the reified
**[subject]{.underline}** of history. To put it bluntly, [such
**inability**]{.underline}, [or **refusal**]{.underline},
[to]{.underline} "[see]{.underline}" [**beyond** the European
frame]{.underline} of the world of being [is to **perpetuate a colonial
philosophy of Eurocentric arrogance**]{.underline}. Before I explain my
meaning of the extraordinariness of the ordinary, it is worth
demonstrating the continuing coloniality of such purportedly radical
post-Enlightenment thought; Zizek serves as an example.

Zizek's anguish, frustration, and impatience, with the state of the
world and its thinking in the present, are constantly repeated. In this,
he is utterly dismissive of the "left liberal morons" in Europe and
contemptuous of their self-flagellation in "confessing Europe's own
sins" and in "humbly accepting the limitations of the European legacy";
for Zizek, it is precisely a fervent fidelity to the ideas and ideals of
Europe that is necessary to overcome the problems of the present.57
While disdainful of "reformists," Zizek is also dismissive of the many
expressions of peoples' anger that have so excited other philosophers of
ruptural hope; Zizek explains:

It is not enough, then, to reject the depoliticized rule of the experts;
one must also begin to think seriously about what to propose in place of
the predominant economic organization, to imagine and experiment with
alternative forms of organization, to search for the germs of the new in
the present. Communism is not just or predominantly a carnival of mass
protest...it is also and above all a new form of organization,
discipline and hard work.58

[This **perceived carnivalistic tendency**]{.underline}, [this **lack of
substantive organization** toward]{.underline}
"**[communism]{.underline}**," [is]{.underline} for Zizek
**[unsatisfactory]{.underline}**. [This]{.underline} said, Zizek [then
**cautions against** any such attempt to **actualize** such
alternatives]{.underline}:

However, following a properly dialectical necessity, this urge to invent
new forms of organization should simultaneously be kept at a distance.
[What should be **resisted**]{.underline} at this stage [is any **hasty
translation** of the energy of the protest into a set of **concrete
demands**]{.underline}. The protests have created a vacuum---a vacuum in
the field of hegemonic ideology, and time is needed to fill this space
in a positive fashion.59

[These two **apparently contradictory** wisdoms can only be reconciled
perhaps if we understand that herein is the space reserved]{.underline}
for the ilk of Zizek [to do the work of **searching** for
the]{.underline} "[**germs of the new** in the present]{.underline},"
[to **criticize**]{.underline}, [to **think**]{.underline}, [to
**dismiss**]{.underline}, [to **fill that space**]{.underline}, that
"vacuum," [with]{.underline} "**[positive content]{.underline}**"; [the
radical philosopher emerges as the]{.underline} contemporary priest, if
not **[oracle]{.underline}**, [to serve as the **heroic arbiter** of the
true path]{.underline}:

The only way out of this dilemma is to abandon the entire paradigm of
"resistance to a dispositive"...[The **task of emancipatory politics**
lies]{.underline} elsewhere: not in elaborating a proliferation of
strategies of "resisting" the dominant dispositif from marginal
subjective positions, but [in thinking about the modalities of a
possible radical rupture]{.underline} in the dominant dispositif
itself.60

Thus, the Zizekian assumption of judgment---of the good, the bad, and
the pointless of "revolt" qua revolution.61

But [a **series of issues** arise]{.underline} from Zizek's impatience
and irritation with nonrevolutionary revolt. [It is unclear **who** it
is to be charged with the responsibility to]{.underline}
"\[[think]{.underline}\] about the modalities of a possible radical
rupture in the dominant dispositif itself"; [no explanation of **what it
means** to think and act a radical rupture]{.underline} of the "dominant
dispositif," [or **when** such truths may be **known** as
truth]{.underline}, [is provided]{.underline}. All that is known is that
thus spoke Zizek. There is no equivocation here, no doubt of judgment
and proclamation. For Zizek, nothing but an absolute fidelity to the
idea that is Europe, rebirthed by revolutionary terror ala the French
Revolution, would satisfy. Therefore, it is not just the "moronic"
dispositions of the European reformists that find no accommodation in
Zizekian visions of the communist revolution, but no dilution of the
essential "core" of the European legacy as might be suggested by other
wisdoms of being can be tolerated.62 Zizek's reading of the "ambiguous"
nature of the rebellion of the Zapatista communities in Chiapas, Mexico,
illustrates this well:

we encounter here the same ambiguity: are these autonomous spaces
\[reclaimed by the Zapatista communities\] germs of the
organization-to-come of the entire society, or just phenomena emerging
in the crevices and gaps in the social order? Marcos's formulation that
the Zapatistas are not interested in the Revolution but, rather, in a
revolution that makes revolution possible is deeply true, but
nonetheless profoundly ambiguous. Does this mean that the Zapatistas are
a "Cultural Revolution" laying the foundation for the actual political
revolution...or does it mean that they should remain merely a site of
resistance, a corrective to the existing power (not only without the aim
to replace it but without the aim to organize conditions in which this
power will disappear)?63

[What is here revealed is the **inherent colonial tendencies** that
persist]{.underline}. While Zizek calls for a "radical rupture" of the
dominant dispositif, he cannot accept that it might be precisely the
assumptions of the idea of Europe that requires rupturing; in this
connection, Zizek's **[Eurocentrism]{.underline}** disables
\[**[prevents]{.underline}**\] him from [envisaging]{.underline} what
Ghassan Hage terms an "alter-politics," that is "[a politics aimed at
**providing an alternative** to the political order]{.underline}," [as
opposed to]{.underline} "antipolitics" that is [an]{.underline}
"[**oppositional politics** aimed at **resisting** and **defeating** the
existing order]{.underline}."64 That perhaps it is precisely an
alternative to the Eurocentric imagination of the political order (as
rupture of the dispositif) that is at the heart of the Zapatista's
"theoretical revolution"65 appears to be lost on Zizek as he sits in
judgment on the future of revolution. And as Zizek waits, [so must we
**wait**]{.underline}, [and **trust**]{.underline}, [or so appears to be
the **prescription** for the]{.underline} "[future]{.underline}."66
[Seen from a decolonial perspective]{.underline} which does not still
cling on fervently to a faith in the "lost causes" of a mythical
"European legacy", however, Zizek's [Eurocentrism results in a
**negation of imagination itself**]{.underline}; [being fixed on some
**fantastical truth-event**]{.underline}, such [Eurocentric
readings]{.underline} of the world [are **incapable** precisely to see
**beyond**]{.underline} the **[coloniality]{.underline}** of
post-Enlightenment categories. Hamid Dabashi provides a scathing
response:

Zizek and his fellow philosophers are oblivious to those \[other
decolonial\] geographies because [they **cannot read** any other
script]{.underline}, [any other map]{.underline}, [than the **colonial
script** and the **colonial map** with which Europeans have read and
navigated the world]{.underline}; conversely they cannot read any other
script or map because they are blinded to alternative geographies that
resistance to that colonialism had written and navigated. There is a new
condition beyond postcoloniality that these Europeans cannot read, hard
as they try to assimilate it back into the condition of
coloniality....European philosophers chase after their own tails.67

### Link---Refusal

#### Refusal trades off with collective organization.

**Shulman, 21**---teaches political theory at The Gallatin School of New
York University (George, "Fred Moten's Refusals and Consents: The
Politics of Fugitivity," Political Theory, Vol. 49(2), 272--313, dml)
\[inserted "when" for grammatical integrity---insertion denoted by
brackets\]

In turn, radical democrats may refuse his reduction of politics to
sovereignty, but [if we]{.underline} then [identify the **properly
political** as **[nonsovereign]{.mark}**]{.underline} action, as nonrule
or (fugitive) **[[refusal]{.underline}]{.mark}** to be governed, [we
[remain **captive** to]{.mark} this [**demonic picture** of
power]{.mark} and its **idealized other**. By affirming **only** the
"**power to**" of solidarity and action in concert, we [risk
**disavowing**]{.mark} power "**over**," as **[participation]{.mark} in
rule**, as **explicit rule-making**, [and]{.mark} as "[**ruling out**"
antidemocratic interests]{.mark} and practices. [Do we imagine that
generativity thrives **only by refusing**]{.mark} **rule**, [and not
also through]{.mark} forms of [**structure** and even
**imposition**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as parents and teachers know? As
Prospero, a personification of both sovereignty and theory, finally
acknowledged Caliban as the "dark thing" he must "own as mine," the
trope of fugitivity entails a disavowed remainder, [the **problem of
power** and **rule**]{.underline}, which **[needs to be
acknowledged]{.underline}**. For [[freedom requires **not only flight
from rule**, but]{.mark} **flight [into it]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} as a
problem that **no one can escape**, but that a democratic politics
**explicitly acknowledges** and undertakes to **rework by participatory
practices** of contest]{.underline}.40

Using Moten's own idiom, I would ask: ["What if" we **do not
dichotomize** the informal assembly and praxis of fugitive sociality,
and politics-as-rule predicated on exclusion and regulation of
difference? "What if" a democratic theory must **blur** the social and
political but also [acknowledge]{.mark} **inescapable**, **fraught**,
yet **potentially [fruitful tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline}---between
tacit grammar and explicit acts of translation, [[between **informal**
form and **organized**]{.mark} forms of [power]{.mark}]{.underline},
between fugitive aliveness as resistance to rule, and organizing
democratic power to make claims on how the world is ruled? ["What if" we
**refuse** (**not reverse**) the **abstract polarity** between
subjection to sovereign rule as such, or statelessness as **refusal to
be governed** as such, and "come down to earth"]{.underline} as Marx put
it? [We then [find politicality]{.mark} **not in rule** or
**nonrule**]{.underline}, as such, [but [in the **judgments**]{.mark}
and **actions** by [which]{.mark} subalterns [address **who makes
decisions** (and **how**) about **which practices**]{.mark}, **values**,
and **inequalities** [are]{.mark} being [**ruled out**,
or]{.mark}]{.underline} which **[[encouraged]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in
the communities they are building by socio-poetic insurgency? [In
difficult historical contexts [they **rework**]{.mark} and **mediate
tacit grammars**, **customary practices**, and **explicit forms of
[organized power]{.mark}** [as]{.mark}]{.underline} they reconstitute
**[[democratic forms]{.underline}]{.mark}** of rule-making.41

These what-ifs suggest a conversation between Moten and Sheldon Wolin.
The parallels are striking. Wolin depicts a "system" so "immovable and
interconnected as to be unreformable as a totality"; he calls
"pessimism" a "reasoned insight" and "suppressed revolutionary impulse";
and he endorses a "rejectionism" whereby citizens "withdraw and direct
their energies and civic commitment to finding new life forms."
Moreover, "instead of imitating most political theories," which adopt
"the state as the primary structure, and adapt the activity of citizens"
to it, Wolin refuses "the state paradigm" and the "liberal-legal
corruption of the citizen." He affirms how "common life resides in
cooperation and reciprocity that human beings develop to survive, meet
their needs, and explore their capacities and the remarkable world into
which they have been cast." He thus rejects Arendt's splitting of
political and social, and her valorization of the "who," and in Moten's
terms he instead values how "entanglement and virtuosity" are negotiated
in the "common life" of the ordinary. Both theorists thus defend
"preservation" of customary ways of "taking care of beings and things,"
as Wolin says, against neoliberal correction, progressive promises of
incorporation, and radical romances of emancipation.42

Moten's two antagonisms---between the few who run things and things that
run, and between informal form and formalization---echo Wolin's critique
of bureaucracy, of "institutionalized systems of power," and of
"constitutional democracy"; and Moten's refusals resonate with Wolin's
late claim that democracy names not a form of government but "fugitive"
moments of insurgency. And though Wolin seems to mean "fugitive" only in
its temporal sense of transient or fleeting, he also depicts democracy
as interdicted by idioms of governance, contained by constitutions and
organized power, and pathologized by norms stipulating the legal and
proper. Like blackness--- though Wolin never makes this
association---his democracy is (called) criminal, transgressive, and
chaotic; it is feared, hunted, and enclosed, though also "wanted,"
desired, and used for legitimation. Both theorists embrace such epithets
while showing how insurgency bespeaks "jurisgenerative" energies,
engendered by commonality and memory, that precede and surround formal
(state-centric) politics. Their fugitive protagonists---an undercommons
or popular insurgency---claim a spatial and symbolic distance from a
deranged modern regime, and in Wolin's words "replace the old
citizenship" by "a fuller and wider notion of being, whose politicalness
will be expressed not in one or two activities---voting or
protesting---but in many." Of course, this very "politicalness" is one
mark of deep differences.43

Though Wolin's awareness of racial inequality appears in repeated
associations of democratic moments and social movements with black
insurgency, he does not grasp how "commonality" names not (only) a
resource against enclosure but the historical production of whiteness
and settler colonialism. He laments the gap between formal citizenship
and genuine participation, which effectively disempowers legally
enfranchised citizens, but never construes citizenship as a racial
status, "standing" as white, constituted by a racial state of exception.
His hard-pressed "citizens" draw on tacit (local, rooted) customs, but
he does not credit how their "commonality" reproduces popular power by
racial terror. Moten thus brings to this idiom of commonality and
democracy, as to Arendt's "common sense" and "world," a justified
presumption that such predicates of the political mean antiblackness.
But acknowledging this truth is also the premise of thinking abolition
and radical democracy together.44

For if Wolin's commonality risks racial innocence, his idea of [[the
political]{.mark} remains **essential** because it [highlights]{.mark}
the [**foreclosures** in]{.mark}]{.underline} Moten's sociality. First,
Wolin depicts both tacit commonality and explicit insurgency as
contingent and, in that sense, as political. Whereas Moten depicts
[[sociality **underwritten by ontology**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and
**reproduced**]{.underline} as antiblackness generates "common
habitation and flight," Wolin sees every (under)common undone by
political economy and individualism, not only [by **incorporation** into
formal politics]{.underline}. Whereas Moten imagines the "absolute
sufficiency" of sociality informally reproduced, Wolin argues that
[commonality]{.underline} itself [is (re)generated and remade **only**
by practices that, though "emerging out of" sociality,
**politicize**---**acknowledge**, **(re)articulate**, or
**(re)organize**---**tacit customs** and **vernacular memories**. Tacit
[commonality is]{.mark} at once discovered, remade and [regenerated
**only** \[when\] people make]{.mark} **explicit claims** in "[**public
declarations**," or]{.mark} **visibly [exercise]{.mark}** ["**collective
power**" to "promote]{.mark} or protect the well-being" of [a
"**collectivity**]{.mark}]{.underline}," including an undercommon.45

Second, Wolin also links and distinguishes sociality and politicality by
depicting the experience and practice of sharing and exercising power.
For Wolin, local or customary "institutions and practices are sustained"
only by our "capacity to share in power, to cooperate in it." ["Power
to," generated and shared by the **ongoing practices of assembly** and
**cooperation** that Moten calls **[planning]{.mark}**, is thus the
**basis** of all other goods. But]{.underline}, as "distilled" from the
"relations and circles we move within"---call this Moten's
sociality---[this power, at once "**symbolic**, **material**, and
**psychological**," "**enables political beings to act
together**."]{.underline} As the political dimension of sociality,
["power" can be **extracted by states** or **undermined by
individualism**, and thus alienated, a loss that **devitalizes the
solidarity**---and thereby the **generative capacity**---of
sociality]{.underline}. The recurring "loss of the political," as
capacities to articulate the tacit and organize power, reveals the
nature of the political as a distinctive "mode of experience," for "we
are always losing it and having to recover it." [But "**renewal**" is
**always possible**]{.underline}, partly "as human beings rediscover the
common being of human beings," [partly by "creating **new patterns of
commonality**" across differences, and partly by (re)making "**modes of
action**" by which to "**concert their powers**."]{.underline} Though
grounded in sociality, Wolin's political thus opens an interval between
the tacit and the explicit, in which experience is metabolized and
(re)articulated. [In this interval people **question the organization of
power** and **rules of justice**, and they **answer** as they
"[**reinvent forms**]{.mark} and **practices**" [that express]{.mark} "a
**[democratic]{.mark} conception** of [collective
life]{.mark}."]{.underline}46

For Moten, of course, "democratic" and collective" signal the alienated
rule that abstracts from lived sociality to "designate" a political to
represent us, whereas black fugitives refuse to be governed or
represented by others but also to translate themselves into legible
political terms. In contrast, Wolin offers a potentially fruitful, not
only correctional or appropriative---we might say agonistic---relation
between the tacit and the explicit. In fact, [practices of "**[fugitive
democracy]{.mark}**" recurrently emerge in and from black sociality, as
the practices of **Black Lives Matter** activism most recently
[demonstrate]{.mark}]{.underline}. For sure, [[practices of
**concealment**]{.mark} and **evasion**]{.underline}, which defend black
fugitivity from surveillance, regulatory correction, and violence,
[**[and]{.mark}** practices of **[public action]{.mark}**]{.underline}
that [**[engage]{.mark} whites** and [the **state**]{.mark}, [are
**contradictory in crucial ways**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Juliet Hooker
has argued. [But]{.underline} as Rom Coles and Lia Haro argue,
[frontline communities on the underground railroad also **engaged
repeatedly** in "**flagrantly public**" action [in **concert**]{.mark},
both in **literal self-defense** of black autonomy in its fugitive
illegality, and to **contest the rule(s)** of police, the law, and the
state]{.underline}; as recent protests suggest, [[they viewed]{.mark}
**formal political [institutions]{.mark}** [both as "**integral to white
supremacy so far**," but also "as]{.mark} **potential [instruments
toward emancipatory ends]{.mark}**."]{.underline}47

If Hooker sees temporal shifts between moments of "black fugitivity" and
moments of "fugitive democracy" in the thought and practice of Frederick
Douglass, Coles/Haro depict an ongoing "oscillation" between
inward-facing and outward-turning practices. Likewise, Neil Roberts
defends grand marronage for seeking a "sustainable rather than fleeting
form of flight" by forging autonomous spaces, and yet, because
"[[freedom]{.underline}]{.mark} in our world [[lies **not in permanent
evasion of Leviathan**]{.underline}" [but in "**taming**"
it]{.underline}]{.mark}, he proposes an idea of "sociogenic marronage"
to reconstruct "an order in need of systemic repair." Not
coincidentally, Wolin's [fugitive democracy, though "**rejectionist**"
and **antistatist** in its major chords, includes a **social democratic
minor key**, which notes the **limits of [localism]{.mark}** and the
**necessity of seeking** and **using state power** to address structural
inequality and collective fate]{.underline}.48

Complex and generative tensions are lost, then, as Moten [[recovers the
**freedom schools**]{.mark} organized [by Fannie Lou Hamer but **not her
organizing** for the **right to**]{.mark} **vote**, to
**[exercise]{.mark} popular sovereignty locally**]{.underline},
especially around police and schools, [but also to create a
"**Mississippi Freedom [Democratic]{.mark} Party**" that entered
national [politics]{.mark}. Hamer (like the Black Panthers and Black
Lives Matter) models how black radicalism has lived in an **interval**
between the]{.underline} tacit grammar and [ongoing "**planning**" of
black fugitivity]{.underline}---as loopholes of retreat practiced and
concealed in plain sight---[and **flagrant publicity** as **fugitive
democracy**]{.underline}. Whereas for Moten, the historical failure or
defeat of outward-facing public action proves the futility of fugitive
democracy, I would ask: "what if" we follow his own fugitive view that
any being or act is both incomplete and excessive, to infer that
[[specific historical experiments are **not definitive failures**, but
**unfinished** ]{.mark}**in meaning**, [examples we could **retrieve**
and **refashion**]{.mark} now? If keeping open such possibility **risks
cruel optimism**, foreclosing it **reifies the impasse** he]{.underline}
generatively [transvalues]{.underline} in so many other ways.

### Link---Revolutionary Violence

#### Revolutionary violence [fails]{.underline} and [isn't]{.underline} ontologically liberating.

**More, 21**---professor of philosophy at the University of Limpopo
(Mabogo, "Sartre's Solutions," *Sartre on Contingency: Antiblack Racism
and Embodiment*, Chapter 7, 187-191, dml)

[Since]{.underline} the [collective radical conversion of the racist is
**not possible**]{.underline}, [then the **only possible
solution**]{.underline}, the only other way forward toward socialism, a
society of equal freedoms, [has to be]{.underline} through **[violent
revolution]{.underline}** on the part of the oppressed. Simone de
Beauvoir attests to this:

We know only too well that we can not count upon a collective
conversion. However, by virtue of the fact that the oppressors refuse to
co-operate in the affirmation of freedom, they embody, in the eyes of
all men of good will, the absurdity of facticity; by calling for the
triumph of freedom over facticity, ethics also demands that they be
suppressed; and since their subjectivity, by definition, escapes our
control, it will be possible to act only on their objective presence;
others will here have to be treated like things, with violence. (1994:
97)

[In **Hegelian** terms]{.underline}, [the slave **must act** to change
the world]{.underline} and his situation for, as Sartre and de Beauvoir
remind us, it is not the natural world which is oppressive but the world
of human beings: "Only man can be an enemy for man; only he can rob him
of the meaning of his acts and his life because it also belongs only to
him alone to confirm it in its existence, to recognize it in actual fact
as a freedom" (de Beauvoir, 1994: 82). [What becomes
**clear**]{.underline} from de Beauvoir's statement [is
that]{.underline} only one human being can rob or deny another of her
dignity or self-esteem precisely because it is through another human
being that dignity and humanity are validated. It is one human being who
can deny another's humanity, question another's humanity, demand that
the other justify her humanity and thus her freedom. An [appeal
to]{.underline} Kantian **[morality]{.underline}** of treating others as
ends, an appeal to God, **[humanity]{.underline}**, or brotherhood,
**[will not be effective]{.underline}**. [The oppressed or slave **must
revolt**]{.underline}.

In Sartre's view, [**colonialism** and **racism**]{.underline}---[qua
forms of **oppression** and denial of the **humanity** of the colonized
and black victims]{.underline}, a refusal and deprivation of human
freedom---[constitute **violence** and can]{.underline} therefore
[**only** be responded to through **violence**]{.underline}. "No
gentleness can efface the marks of violence; only violence itself can
destroy them" (Sartre in Fanon, 1968: 21). That is why in a colonial
situation: "\[To\] shoot down a European is to kill two birds with one
stone, to destroy an oppressor and the man he oppresses at the same
time; there remain \[sic\] a dead man, and a free man" (Sartre in Fanon,
1968: 22). Does this therefore imply that Sartre joins Georges Sorel in
advocating violence for violence's sake? Can he justly be characterized
as the "prophet of violence"? It seems that neither Sartre nor de
Beauvoir preaches violence for its own sake. Morally, violence is for
him inexcusable. But under certain circumstance in which freedom is at
stake, then it may become a necessary choice. He remarks: "I recognize
that violence, under whatever form it may show itself, is a setback. But
it is an inevitable setback because we are in a universe of violence;
and if it is true that recourse to violence against violence risks
perpetuating it, it is also true that it is the only means of bringing
an end to it" (Sartre, 1988: 232). Sartre has been struggling with the
problem of violence within himself since the early part of his career.
He expressed this concern initially in some of his plays, such as Dirty
Hands (Les Mains Sales, 1948), In the Mesh (L'Engrenage, 1948), and The
Devil and the Good Lord (Le Diable et le Bon Dieu, 1951). He realized
that [many]{.underline} of the **[significant structures]{.underline}**
of our world [are **immersed** in violence]{.underline}, that "[we are
in a **universe** of violence]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} therefore
[it is **almost impossible** not to get one's hands **soiled with
blood**]{.underline}. This theme of "dirty hands" expressed Sartre's
acceptance of violence even though it is morally problematic.

According to Sartrean existential ontology, human freedom is the
primordial aspect of human existence. Freedom is not something that
human reality possesses or a property of human beings, but something
which human reality is. Given that the negation of this freedom
constitutes violence against the being of human reality, then the
negation of this freedom can only be justified if that negation itself
proves to be in the service of freedom itself. But, given that violence
can sometimes be in the service of freedom itself; then such violence
can be justified.

[The **problem** with violence]{.underline}, however, [is that it might
turn out as a **contradiction**]{.underline} at times, [for it may
**deny** what it **affirms**]{.underline}. [If freedom can have **no
other aim** or **end** but itself]{.underline}, [and if violence is the
**denial** of freedom]{.underline}, [then violence perpetrated to
**uphold** or **secure** denied freedom becomes **problematic** because
violence is a **violation** of freedom]{.underline}. Sartre admits as
much, "Here we come upon the most deep-lying contradiction . . .
[violence involves both **recognition** and **denial** of]{.underline}
human [freedom]{.underline}" (Sartre, 1992: 177, 178). But even though
violence is problematic by virtue of its denial of freedom, sometimes it
may be necessary, particularly in response to violence that denies the
very freedom of others.

Part of the rationale for the necessity of violence in cases where
freedom is denied is that human beings can only be oppressed by human
beings and not by things. From this observation, it follows that if one
acts against oppression one necessarily acts against other human beings.
This explains one of the aporias of action. One cannot act for humans
without acting against them. In this case, an ethical action would
require an attempt at a radical conversion of the oppressor rather than
an appeal to violence. But since, as de Beauvoir has noted, we cannot
count on the collective conversion of the oppressor, reality dictates
another course: violence. In such circumstances, violence though
unethical is however justifiable because in its very conception, it is a
violence of freedom not only for the oppressed but for the oppressor as
well. The oppressors or racists, because they are free, have an
opportunity to treat the oppressed humanly. Unfortunately, in the grip
of bad faith, they choose not to do so. But to allow this manifestation
of their freedom to negate the freedom of others would be immoral.
Therefore, violent action is morally necessary because it aims at the
emancipation of both the oppressor and the oppressed; that is, it aims
at the freedom of all human beings. In her Ethics of Ambiguity, Simone
de Beauvoir contends that liberation for one means liberation for all,
"To will oneself free is also to will others free" (1994: 73). This
position echoes Sartre's claim in Existentialism and Humanism, "I am
obliged to will the liberty of others at the same time as mine, I cannot
make liberty my aim unless I make that of others equally my aim" (1966:
52).

In bad faith, the oppressor negates those conditions which would
maximize the freedom of the oppressed. He or she is therefore an enemy
of humanity. To act against such a human being is not to act against
humanity but in the interest of humanity. As de Beauvoir aptly puts it:
"A freedom which is occupied in denying freedom is itself so outrageous
that the outrageousness of the violence which one practices against it
is cancelled out" (1994: 97). People of good will and reason would
definitely endorse this position. For example, by 1952, Nelson Mandela6
was already thinking along Sartrean and de Beauvoirian lines in relation
to violence. Through the violence of the apartheid machine, Mandela
began to understand that violence understands only the language of
violence. Hence, in 1961, amid serious objections from Chief Albert
Luthuli and others in the ANC who were morally committed to the Gandhian
nonviolence position, Mandela argued for counter-violent military
struggle for liberation. During his Rivonia trail he offered the
following argument for counterviolence:

After a long and anxious assessment of the South African situation, I,
and some colleagues, came to the conclusion that as violence in this
country was inevitable, it would be unrealistic and wrong for African
leaders to continue preaching peace and non-violence at a time when the
Government met our peaceful demands with force.

This conclusion was not easily arrived at. It was only when all else had
failed, when all channels of peaceful protest had been barred to us,
that the decision was made to embark on violent forms of political
struggle, and to form Umkhonto We Sizwe. We did so not because we
desired such a course, but solely because the Government had left us no
other choice. (Mandela in Meredith, 1997: 265)

We should note that the person who thinks that violence is morally
justifiable does not have to deny that if such an action is avoidable,
that is, if freedom can be realized without loss of life, then this is
the desirable course of action. But if violence must be used against
oppressors in order to eradicate oppression, this action, while teeming
with what is undesirable, is however preferable to allowing oppression
to exist.

In the face of insidious American racism, Malcolm X once declared that
black people should strive for liberation By Any Means Necessary (1970).
But, as William R. Jones (in Harris, 1983: 232) has demonstrated,
Malcolm's position was not violence for its own sake. Indeed, Malcolm
recognized the need for certain limitations in counterviolence. Even for
Sartre, counterviolence against oppression is justified under the
following conditions: (1) It must be only provisional and cannot produce
systems that keep human beings perpetually in a condition of
sub-humanity, (2) It can never be the first resort or easy way out. It
must be the "sole possible means to make man" (Sartre, cited in
Anderson, 1993: 127), (3) It is born of the masses, (4) One struggles
against it even in using it so that it is rigorously limited to what is
absolutely necessary, (5) It must be denounced and presented as subhuman
to those subject to it, so that it does not hide their true goal from
them (Anderson, 1993: 127). Indeed, Sartre's political writings reveal
that he made a distinction between indiscriminate acts of terrorist
violence which are valueless to the revolutionary objective and class or
colonial violence which are justifiableacts of retaliatory violence in
response to the numerous forms of oppression effected and maintained by
the ruling or colonial elite.

My contention is that [the phenomenon of racism is a problem which
should be **fought on many fronts** because there is **no single form**
of racism]{.underline}7 [requiring a **single huge
solution**]{.underline}, [but a **plurality** of racisms in **different
forms**]{.underline}. This of course raises the question: Will violence
eliminate racism? The answer is: Maybe. What [violence
**can**]{.underline} achieve, in a colonial situation, is to [effect an
**objective modification** of the historical situation by **transferring
power**]{.underline} from the colonizer to the colonized [or
**transform** the political situation]{.underline} from a capitalist
society into a socialist society if need be. [These changes]{.underline}
in the situation **[would not necessarily constitute]{.underline}**
purely subjective [**transformation** of the **racist
subject**]{.underline}. Indeed, [it might even **reproduce racist
stereotypes** about the colonized or blacks]{.underline}, [that they are
**violent** and **uncivilized** because they appeal to **barbaric
means**]{.underline} to resolve human problems. [The powerful have a way
of **naming** and **describing** phenomena according to their **own
wishes** and **advantage**]{.underline}. [An act of violence perpetrated
by the oppressed will be described as]{.underline}
"**[barbaric]{.underline}**, [**uncivilized** and
**cowardly**]{.underline} act of violence" [while]{.underline} the same
[violence against the oppressed]{.underline} by the oppressor [will be
described as]{.underline} "pre-emptive strike" or "[**self-defensive**
or **self-protective**]{.underline} immobilization of the enemy."

### Link---Semiocapitalism

#### Their ev relies on some autonomous soul that can be recuperated to effectively resist semiocapitalism---double bind, [either]{.underline} that's a double-turn with all their posthuman neuroscience affect args because those would deny any authentic human subject [or]{.underline} it means they [uniquely reify]{.underline} settler colonialism

**Povinelli, 17**---Franz Boas Professor of Anthropology and Gender
Studies at Columbia University (Elizabeth, "The Ends of Humans:
Anthropocene, Autonomism, Antagonism, and the Illusions of Our Epoch,"
South Atlantic Quarterly 2017 Volume 116, Number 2: 293-310, dml)
\[extimacy=opposite of intimacy\]

[Berardi's call for a **politics of solidarity**]{.underline} between
all life-forms [against]{.underline} the pneumaphagia of [semiocapital
**resonates with** and is **amplified by** an allied movement among
scholars]{.underline} in the humanities and humanistic social sciences
[to **liberate themselves from humanism**]{.underline}. Posthumanist
scholars have attacked a series of ontological distinctions between the
human animal and other animals (the various ways humans "begin to
distinguish themselves from animals"; Marx and Engels \[1970\] 2004:
42). Homo sapiens, the "wise person," may approach existence through a
specific interpretive form (intentionality, self-awareness, logos), but
nonhuman animals have forms of interpretation and "aboutness" that allow
them to adjust behavior, make use of elements in their environment, and
in doing so alter the conditions in which they find themselves---and
then start the cycle again (see, e.g., Yablo 2014). In Berardi's work
[the protagonists of contemporary semiocapital and its role in climate
change and toxicity are **not humans**]{.underline} against other
biotic, meteorological, and geological forces [but **all of life**,
including human life (**the soul**), against semiocapitalism's
**rapacious subjugation of all existence**]{.underline}.

But if [this **new possibility** and **form of solidarity**]{.underline}
provides a positive pathway for a new form of revolt against capital, it
also [opens a **new set of political problems**]{.underline}. The
problems follow from the same critique autonomists and others level
against the anthropocenic Human. [Life does not exist in general **any
more than the Human exists in general**]{.underline}. More crucially,
[in the anthropogenic condition of **climate change** and **toxicity**,
**even the phrase** "**forms of life**" **mystifies rather than
analyzes** how the concept of antagonism works when **every region of
existence** is a set of **accumulating** and **dissipating
entanglements**]{.underline} (see, e.g., Povinelli 2016). In other
words, [although a **multitude of immanent forms** of entangled
existence exist in any given actual world, this **does not mean that all
actually exist**]{.underline}. Thus, three illusions of contemporary
late liberalism surround us: the autonomy of objects, the antagonisms of
position, and the pluralism of being.

[In the shadow of the **coming catastrophe** of **semiocapital's climate
change** and **toxicity**]{.underline}, do we need a parliament of
things---a demogenesis fitting the simultaneity of soil, earth, and
science (see Latour 2015)? Let's leave aside the question of whether
existence has agreed that its governance is like a human parliament.
[Are some things going to get **more ballots**, or **more weight in the
voting**]{.underline}? Will we only allow those forms of entanglement
that are our companion species to vote, excluding various forms of
viruses, bacteria, and algae? Probably---this is the point of an
antagonism defining the field of solidarity. And will the parliament of
things include all things living and nonliving? Will desert sands get a
vote? Or [when we **pass out the ballots** will we **predetermine what
does** and **doesn't have a soul**, **refusing the nonliving**, the
**never-having-lived**, a possibility of extending itself? Or do we
decide that **all things are vital**?]{.underline} [Do we **work with
those** who say that from the perspective of anthropogenic climate
change there is **no difference between life and nonlife**?]{.underline}
From the perspective of the carbon cycle, soil, rock, water, air,
microbial, plant, animal: all forms of existence are each other's
internal lung. [Now **not only does the human disappear** into the total
organism of the earth, Gaia, but **so do all other forms of entangled
existence** move into an **extimate relation** to "each"
other]{.underline}. Dick is now wide awake. [There is **no human**, or
even **any humans**, but **merely regionally more** or **less densely
compacted forms** and **modes of existence**, one component of which has
been **abstracted out** and named "**the human**."]{.underline} One can
only get these abstractions---life, human, earth, workers,
mushrooms---by cutting and hacking into and across the rivers, streams,
winds, breaths, roots, wires, chemical migrations in the attempt to
embaginate a region of existence only to find oneself creating new
rivers, streams, winds, breaths, roots, wires, chemical migrations (for
example). One cannot make a body with organs. [**Nothing is
autonomous**, including the **autonomist soul currently under
attack**]{.underline}.

Jean Baudrillard's (1994: 153) prediction for the coming era of
simulacra has come true:

We will live in this world, which for us has all the disquieting
strangeness of the desert and of the simulacrum, with all the veracity
of living phantoms, of wandering and simulating animals that capital,
that the death of capital has made of us---because the desert of cities
is equal to the desert of sand---the jungle of signs is equal to that of
the forests---the vertigo of simulacra is equal to that of nature---only
the vertiginous seduction of a dying system remains, in which work
buries work, in which value buries value---leaving a virgin, sacred
space without pathways, continuous as Bataille wished it, where only the
wind lifts the sand, where only the wind watches over the sand.

[In these deserts not only is the human **liberated from dialectics**,
but it is also **distended from itself**. **What human**? **Where is the
human** when flesh is **inside neurons encased in metal**, cooled by
**vast arrays**, whose power is **generated by vaster networks** of
energy production? **All is multiply distended**, **attuned**, and
**embodied**]{.underline}. And this "where is it / am I" is then
disembodied in the image of the Digital Cloud, which runs a good race
with the anthropocenic Human as the primary illusion of our epoch (see
Carruth 2014; Starosielski 2012; Günel, forthcoming). [The human in
semiocapital is **not within this assemblage** but in the **leakage**
among various forms of corpo-reality. **How** does one "**build forms of
social solidarity** that are **capable of re-activating the social
body**" in the context of this **competitive aggressive subjugation** of
**all forms of existence** in the "competitive aggressiveness" of
contemporary capital?]{.underline} (Berardi quoted in Hugill and
Thorburn 2012: 213). Who are the antagonists? [How does one have an
antagonism when **all is extimate to all**, when **nothing is
autonomous**?]{.underline}

The Autonomy of the Wastelands

[The **autonomous soul** that **Berardi** and **others** seek to defend
from semiocapitalism's assault is, in **other settler colonial spaces**,
not merely an **illusionary construct** but a **weapon of the
enlightened liberal state** in its **constant maneuvering against
indigenous people**]{.underline}. And [where autonomy from late liberal
settler governance does emerge it is **nothing like the autonomy** that
some within the autonomist movement imagine]{.underline}. [Let's start
with autonomy as **weaponry of settler colonialism**]{.underline},
namely, the autological subject. The imaginary of the autological
subject pivots on a miraculous enclosure of a human self defined by
nothing but his or her historical unfolding of desire. Autological
subjects make their history. The sense and drama of this imaginary form
of subjectivity is always contrasted to the genealogical
society---societies in which matters of the heart and labors of life are
defined by preexisting collectively constraining restrictions on
individual risk and exploration. We can think of these two imaginary
forms of sociality as companion species defined by their different
social tense---on the one side we find any account of the actual
freedoms and justices of the autological subject endlessly deferred to
an unreachable future, and on the other we find the genealogical society
relegated to the frozen landscapes of past perfect. [The **normative
orientation** of the]{.underline} autological [subject is said to be the
**open future**---its desire is to **endlessly unfold** in **myriad**
and **unimpeded creative gestures** and **explorations**. Its
sovereignty rests in the **more** or **less self-determining
individual**. But to make this unfolding a **universal historical form**
of **subjectivity** and **governance**, this subject must **make other
forms** and **arrangements** of existence **radically different from
itself** and **historically retrograde**]{.underline}. The autological
subject demands that the genealogical society be its opposite; namely,
the genealogical society is past perfect, and [its sovereignty must rest
in its ability to **determine the truth of the
individual**]{.underline}.

### Link---Settler Colonialism---Land

#### Their understanding of a Settler-Native antagonism \[defined by innate relationships to land\] creates [ontological rifts]{.underline} among humanity that [reifies the colonial project]{.underline}. 

**Sharma, 15**---Director, International Cultural Studies Program,
University of Hawai'i Manoa (Nandita, "Strategic Anti-Essentialism:
Decolonizing Decolonization," *Sylvia Wynter: Being Human as Praxis*,
Chapter 7, pg 170-180, dml) \["nos"=Latin for "we"/"us"\]

Emerging in the post--World War II era, [[indigeneity]{.mark} is a
**relatively recent mode** of representation]{.underline}, one [that
encompasses **very diverse people**]{.underline} across the Americas,
indeed **[across the world]{.underline}**, often [under a **single**,
**shared subjective understanding** of being the "**first**" to live in
any particular place]{.underline}.22 Being indigenous is a form of co-
identification among people who previously did not see any connection
with one another. It is also a way of laying claim to particular lands
(or, more accurately, territories) on the basis of having (or having
once had) specialized knowledge of that place. Yet, [this mode of
representation, however new or potentially expansive, **[remains
particularistic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indigeneity is a form of
subjectivity that emerged because of the devastation wrought in the
aftermath of 1492. Moreover, it is a form of subjectivity that
interpellates people into efforts to gain national sovereignty within
the global system of national states. Indigenous, then, as a mode of
representation includes the often unacknowledged elision between native
as a colonial state category of subjugation and indigenous as a category
of resistance.

[Indigenous conceptualized as such retains]{.underline} two
[**interrelated problems** that ensure that]{.underline} the kinds of
**[unequal relationships]{.underline}** organized in the aftermath of
1492 [are **reproduced**]{.underline}. First, [by [**denying the social
constitution** of the category]{.mark} of indigenous, it
**[disavows]{.mark}** people's now-long **[history of
connectivity]{.mark}** across (and sometimes against) this category.
Because this connectivity **challenges the particularistic nature** of
indigeneity, [recognition of interrelationality is]{.mark} **itself
[represented as a threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Second, [by continuing
to **limit the criteria of membership**]{.underline} of each nos, [each
is **unable to accept as co-specifics** those who are rendered as
**always-already oppositional others**]{.underline}. Indeed, [in
**making any particularistic nos**, the significance of omitting certain
others **cannot be underestimated**]{.underline}.

[The category of [indigenous]{.mark}]{.underline}, thus,
[does]{.underline} a sort of [**political work**. It [produces a
**particular nos**]{.mark}]{.underline} ([and thus a **particular
Other-to-indigenous nos**]{.underline}).23 For some (though certainly
not all) of those currently constituted as indigenous, it seems that one
of the consequences of the enormously uneven Columbian exchange is the
denunciation of the process of exchange itself. Today, the movement of
life, plants, humans, and other animals is often cited as the cause for
the devastation wrought on their native equivalent.24 Rather than focus
on the hierarchical and exploitative relations of the Columbian
exchange, some assume that the cause of the problem was / is mobility
itself. [Within such a worldview, that which **moves** is consequently
denounced as **inherently polluting**, and]{.underline}, in an idiom
that is gaining in popularity, [**movement** and **migration** are
posited as **inherently colonizing**]{.underline}.

[An [understanding]{.mark} of [mobility as **always colonizing** is
evident in]{.mark} the expansion of [the term "**settler colonist**" to
include **all those deemed nonnative**]{.mark} in any given
space]{.underline}. Recently, within both indigenous studies and social
movements for indigenous rights, [the [**historical distinctions**
between]{.mark}]{.underline} the voyages of Columbus (and other
**[[colonizers]{.underline}]{.mark}**) and those of
**[[slaves]{.underline}]{.mark}** who survived the Middle Passage,
**[indentured [workers]{.mark}]{.underline}** recruited in the wake of
slavery's abolition, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} present- day
**[[migrants]{.underline}]{.mark}** captured in a variety of state
categories ranging from illegal to immigrant, [have been
**[collapsed]{.mark}**. **All**, it is claimed, are **agents of
colonialism**]{.underline}. It seems, then, that as there has been an
expansion in the subjective understanding of people as indigenous, there
has been a subsequent expansion in their other. Put differently, [within
some indigenous systems of belonging, all past and present people
constituted as migrants are **situated as colonizers**]{.underline}.

In our present "great age" of migration, how did "colonizer" become a
meaningful way to describe people who move across space?25 Indeed, how
did "colonizer" come to be an increasingly dominant mode of representing
indigenous people's others, others who were once understood as
cocolonized people or, at least, not as an oppositional other? Is there
a relationship between these particularistic modes of representation and
the false separation and hierarchical ranking of different but related
experiences of colonization, such as the processes of expropriation and
people's displacement across space?

The answers to these questions lie within the logics of autochthonous
systems of representation and the ways in which claims to indigeneity
bring to life discourses of alienness or foreignness. Jean Comaroff and
John Comaroff argue, [by "**elevating to a first-principle** the
**ineffable interests** and **connections**]{.underline}, at once
material and moral, [that flow from '**native**' rootedness, and
**special rights**, in a **place of birth**,"]{.underline} autochthonous
[discourses place those constituted as natives **at the top** of a
**hierarchy** of the **exploited**, **oppressed**, and **colonized** and
**insist** on the **centrality** of the **claims of natives** for the
realization of either **decolonization** or **justice**]{.underline}.26
Within the negative duality of natives and nonnatives that such
discourses put into play, **[[origins]{.underline}]{.mark}** (and, in
some contexts, claims of original, versus later, human discovery or
inhabitation) [[become the **key determinant of who belongs**]{.mark} in
any given space today---and **who does not**]{.underline}.

The quintessential alien or foreigner within autochthonous discourses is
the figure of the migrant. This is because the hegemonic understanding
of what it means to be a migrant in today's world is one where migration
is seen as movement away from one's native land. Thus, migrants come to
stand as the ultimate nonnative. [Such a move works to **shift the
focus** from a dialectics of **colonialism**---where the **key
historical dynamic** is one of **expropriation** and
**exploitation**]{.underline}, and the key relationship is one between
the colonizers and the colonized---[to one where the **dichotomy between
native** and **nonnative becomes central** to both **analysis** and
**politics**]{.underline}. Patrick **[Wolfe]{.underline}**, a historian
of Australia, [captures this]{.underline} perspective [well in his claim
that "the **fundamental social divide** is]{.underline} not
[the]{.underline} color **[line]{.underline}**. It is not ethnicity,
minority status, or even class. The primary line is the one
[**distinguishing Natives from settlers**---that is, **from everyone
else**. **[Only the Native is not a settler]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Only
the Native is truly local. Only the Native will free the Native. [[One
is **either native** or **not**]{.mark}."]{.underline}27

From such an autochthonous perspective, being native is both spatially
and temporally dependent. Temporally, migrants may be identified as
natives at some point in time and in some given space, but once having
moved away from the spaces where such representations may be claimed,
they become nonnatives. Spatially, migrants remain native but only to
the places they no longer live in. Thus, some argue that migrants can
continue to claim native rights to places they have moved from if they
are able to show genealogical descendance from those with native status
in that space.28 Candace Fujikane, in dismissing Asian claims to belong
in the United States, puts it this way: "Indigenous people are
differentiated from settlers by their genealogical, familial
relationship with specific land bases that are ancestors to them. One is
either indigenous to a particular land base or one is not. Asian
Americans are undeniably settlers in the United States because we cannot
claim any genealogy to the land we occupy, no matter how many lifetimes
Asian settlers work on the land, or how many Asian immigrants have been
killed through racist persecution and hate crimes, or how brutal the
political or colonial regimes that occasioned Asians' exodus from their
homelands."29

[In this logic, indigeneity is **racialized/ethnicized**, and in the
process, **land**]{.underline}---or more accurately, territory---[is as
well. Natives, it is assumed, belong in "**their**" native land and
**only there**]{.underline}. Further, [[who can be]{.mark} recognized as
[native is **dependent upon ancestry**]{.mark}, thereby [**adding
blood** to the **discourse of soil**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Descent
becomes of further importance in this distinction, for many indigenous
people are, of course, also Asian (and European and African and so on)
as well as vice versa. [It is one's **ability to claim some indigenous
ancestor** that can allow one to be **seen as indigenous** today. While
such claims can be **social** and not **biological**, many indigenous
groups]{.underline}, following from certain governments' own categorical
recognition of indigeneity, [rely on some form of **blood quantum**
rule]{.underline} that requires a minimal indigenous lineage. Not
surprisingly, [[such criteria]{.mark} for belonging]{.underline} (and
for the rights and entitlements of membership) [[**have not always
worked** for those subordinated through **other axes**]{.mark} **of
oppression** and **exploitation**]{.underline}. Thus, [**many women**
have found that their claims to native status are often the **first to
be discounted**]{.underline}.30

In this, [[there is]{.mark} an **ironic [historical continuity]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} autochthonous ideas and practices of belonging
and [the **underlying [logics]{.mark}** [of the
**colonial**]{.mark}]{.underline} (and, in some places, postcolonial)
**[state]{.underline}**. Indeed, [the meaning of native was one that was
used to **distinguish the colonized** from the **colonizer** so that the
natives could be **represented as less human** and]{.underline},
therefore, [as **legitimately colonized**]{.underline}. Being native,
then, was a signifier of being colonized and the ultimate signifier of
abjectness. [Nativeness as a mode of representation]{.underline}, then,
[was designed to **institutionalize the new racist orders** implemented
by different colonial empires]{.underline}. Importantly, all colonized
people were variously identified as "the" natives in order to signal
their lack of membership in the propter nos of the colonizers.31

In the post--World War II era of postcolonialism, when, through much
struggle, colonial empires were removed from the list of legitimate
forms of political rule, the right to claim rights within and to any
given space came, increasingly, to be seen as belonging to "the"
natives. After all, we were told, the anticolonial project was often
posited as fighting for the rule of the natives for the natives. Not
surprisingly, then, the battle over resources and over place has, thus,
increasingly become one about the meaning of nativeness.

In this way, autochthonous modes of belonging are significant in
advancing particular nationalized regimes of rights, for the national
subject is often defined through an exclusive racialized / ethnicized
criteria through which political rights and rights to property,
especially social property rights in land and natural resources, are to
be apportioned within any claimed national space. Contemporary,
postcolonial forms of racism are often based on ideas of autochthony.
All those who are said to have migrated to the places where they live
(or who cannot prove their prior inhabitance) are increasingly viewed as
agents of (instead of co- victims of) colonial projects. The ruling
ideology of nationalism has provided an explanation for belonging and
has come to be a key way to distinguish between who is properly native
to any given place and who is not. Today, the rhetoric of autochthony is
evident throughout the world, including diverse sites in Europe,
southern Africa, Central Africa, Latin America, North America, and the
Pacific. Significantly, such a discourse spans the political spectrum
from the Right to the Left. Here, I focus on the emergence of
autochthonous discourses in indigenous nationalist politics (engaged in
by both natives and nonnatives) in the territories claimed by Canada and
the United States, with a particular focus on the Hawaiian archipelago,
where this discourse is well rehearsed.

The position that all migrants are settler colonists has been advanced
in a number of recent scholarly works in Canada and the United States.
In the context of Hawai'i, it has been argued that "Asians" in Hawai'i
(most of whom are the descendants of contractually indentured plantation
laborers who began arriving in the mid- 1800s) are "settler colonists,"
active in the colonization of native Hawaiians due to their nonnative
status.32 The main distinction between the two groups, they argue, is
that native Hawaiian claims are based on rights of national sovereignty
over "their land, water, and other economic and legal rights," while
Asians, because they are not native, have no right to make such
claims.33

In a Canadian context, Bonita Lawrence's and Enakshi Dua's article
"Decolonizing Antiracism" (2005) in Social Justice makes some of the
same arguments made by the contributors to the special issue of Amerasia
Journal on "Asian Settler Colonialism in Hawai'i."34 Like them, Lawrence
and Dua also focus on those nonnatives who are nonwhite. They contend
that the antiracist praxis of nonwhites has "contribute\[d\] to the
active colonization of Aboriginal peoples."35 Indeed, they contend that
"antiracism is premised on an ongoing colonial project" and on "a
colonizing social formation."36 Postcolonial critiques of national
liberation strategies, social constructivist critiques of the
naturalness of races or nations, and arguments against ethnic
absolutism, such as those made by Stuart Hall, become, for them,
examples of how antiracism is a colonial practice.37 Lawrence and Dua
maintain that these kinds of analyses colonize indigenous people by
"contribut\[ing\] to the ongoing delegitimization of Indigenous
nationhood."38

In these essays, then, critiques of nationalisms or of the
naturalization of social categories are tantamount to attacks against
indigenous people. It is in such assertions that we can find the
ideological character of autochthonous discourses. In arguing for the
theoretical and political centrality of nativeness, there is an effort
to depoliticize native nationalisms. By insisting that any critique of
nationalism is tantamount to a colonial practice, the nationalist
assumptions and politics of native nationalisms are taken out of the
realm of that which can be contested. Consequently, native nationalisms
are posited as the only strategy for decolonization.

It is precisely the nationalism inherent within autochthonous discourses
that helps to explain not only why all nonnatives are conceptualized as
colonizers but also why the (varied) critics of nationalism (or those
who argue for the social basis for ideas of race and ethnic purity, or
those who uncover a politics of solidarity across such lines) are also
colonizers. Negatively racialized persons, in this logic of nationalized
self- determinacy, are relegated to being mere minorities of various
nations and their existing or hoped- for national sovereign states.
Thus, because they are not a people / nation as defined by hegemonic
doctrines of self- determinancy, Asians, for example, in Hawai'i, or
elsewhere in the United States and Canada, are represented as not-
colonized and, therefore, in the dualistic mode of autochthonous
representations, as colonizers.

Within autochthonous discourses [one **can only be colonized** if they
"**belong**" or are **indigenous** to that space itself]{.underline}. In
this view, [the [colonization]{.mark} that people experience [supposedly
**ends** once one **moves away**]{.mark} from the colony]{.underline}
(or, now, the postcolony). Instead, [these migrants come to be
**represented as colonizers**. Because a **key aspect** of the
subjective understanding of indigenous is being a colonized person,
[**only other colonized persons** can be]{.mark} seen to be
**[co-specifics]{.mark}**. Neither those **constituted as
[migrants]{.mark}** nor their **struggles** can be perceived as **part
of anticolonial struggles**]{.underline}. As such, [they **[cannot be
included as commensurate human beings]{.mark}** within any colonial or
postcolonial space.]{.underline}

[[This]{.mark} view imagines the space of colonialism as **finite**. It
**fails to see the broader field of power** that processes of
colonialism opened up]{.underline}. More specifically, [it **fails to
see migration** as a **part of the colonial experience**. The
world]{.underline} as seen through an autochthonous lens [is one of
**discrete**, **disconnected spaces**, each belonging to its native
people]{.underline}. This is the autochthonous view of the world prior
to colonization and of the ideal decolonized space. It thus appears that
as borders and relationships begin to realign to allow for new forms of
subjective understanding and conspecificity, some scholars and activists
are actively working to re- fix borders and territories through
particularistic strategies of identification. [The new mode of
representation of indigeneity]{.underline}, which, ostensibly, appears
to be an expansion in subjective understanding, [[creates a **Manichaean
dualism**]{.mark} of native and nonnative. [Such a
logics]{.mark}]{.underline} of representation assumes that all past and
present processes of exchange are inherently destructive. Colonialism,
from such a view, was (and remains) about people moving about and that
it was / is in this process of moving away from where they are native to
places where they are not that has caused the enormous destruction of
life. By casting all human mobility as colonial acts, autochthonous
modes of representation, ironically, [[**empty out** from the meaning of
colonialism]{.mark} the **enormous [violence]{.mark}** that has been
done by colonizers. It also **minimalizes**---or even **denies**---the
**violence done** to people who **moved** and who **move
today**]{.underline}.

[Borders, including the borders between natives and
nonnatives]{.underline}, although seemingly about the physical
separation of those in the national nos from its foreign others, then,
[are **primarily concerned with making differences** within the **same
space** that the nos and its others both live in. Because
**we**]{.underline}---and, with Sylvia Wynter, I use "we" in all the
fullness of the term "**[humans]{.underline}**"---[have long lived in a
world that is **connected across now-demarcated spaces**, making
**[claims]{.mark}**]{.underline} to land, to livelihoods, and [[**to
belonging** on]{.mark} the basis of **[particularistic
claims]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as a racialized national membership,
[**only works to [ensure]{.mark}** that]{.underline} the
[**[oppressions]{.mark}** and **exploitations**]{.underline} wrought in
the aftermath of 1492 [[are **maintained**]{.mark}, albeit [in **new
guises**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Conclusion

Autochthonous discourses present the Columbian exchange as a zerosum
game between putative "groups" of natives and nonnatives. Neglected
within such discursive modes of representation is the fact that the
gross inequalities engendered by this exchange were structured not by
some inherent struggle between natives and nonnatives but by a set of
struggles between expropriators and the expropriated, the exploiters and
the exploited, the oppressors and the oppressed. Tragically, these
struggles were won by those who cemented their victory in a set of
social relations that institutionalized private property, an ever-
expanding capitalist mode of production, colonial, and then national,
state power, and an interlocking web of ranked hierarchies formed around
ideologies of the noncommensurability of humans through ideas of "race,"
gender, "nation," and citizenship. Each of these has been normalized to
the extent that even (some of) the expropriated, exploited, and
oppressed people on earth have come to identify with these ideologies
instead of with each other.

However, if we understand the New World not simply as a mistaken
formulation of Columbus imagining himself in the western part of India
but one that brought the four hemispheres together in a global field of
power, we come to see that the New World was made in and across multiple
geographic sites. The moments of New World invention necessarily
involved people across the planet and came into being not suddenly, in
1492, but over a longer period through which "European" elites expanded
the territories they controlled and responded to the incredible
consolidation and spread of capitalism. Indeed, as Sylvia Wynter well
shows, the shorthand of "1492" does not capture the fact that the
processes leading to the colonization of people in the Caribbean and
Americas were begun by much earlier imperial ventures in the Middle
East, western Mediterranean, eastern Atlantic and West Africa.39
Encounters here established a specific pattern of relations that were to
be extended not only to the Caribbean and Americas but, importantly,
within the space of what we now call Europe.

The New World, then, was forged through processes that people across
space and time would be able to recognize. Marcus Rediker calls these
processes the "four violences": the expropriation of the commons both in
Europe and in the Americas; African slavery and the Middle Passage; the
exploitation and the institution of wage labor; and the repression
organized through prisons and the criminal justice system.40 Silvia
Federici adds to our understanding of these shared experiences by
showing that the persecution of women and the containment of their
liberty (especially during various and ongoing hunts for witches) were
crucial elements in the Columbian exchange.41

People's shared experience of the terror of expropriation, exploitation,
and oppression led to their shared resistance, something, unfortunately,
left unexamined within Wynter's oeuvre.42 Neither the ruling- class
version of colonization- as- progress nor the autochthonous view that
colonization was caused by "foreigners" entering native spaces tells us
this story. Recent work by social historians, such as Peter Linebaugh
and Marcus Rediker, or political theorists such as Michael Hardt and
Antonio Negri, however, show that there was indeed a serious struggle
over the terms of what is now (too ahistorically and uniformly) often
called "modernity."43 That capitalists were victorious in this struggle
should not blind us to the fact that they did not instigate the
revolution (or the "root expansion in thought" that Sylvia Wynter
discusses in relation to Columbus's challenging of medieval European
notions of space). The bourgeoisie, instead, were part of the
counterrevolution against those actively challenging extant forms of
ruling in Europe, including challenges to the medieval idea of
transcendent power of all sorts (church, God, king / queen).

The **[actual revolutionaries]{.underline}** were derisively called the
multitude or the motley crew and were composed of the rural commoners,
urban rioters, fishers, market women, weavers, and many others who
[**mobilized countless rebellions** to realize their **immanent demand**
that producers **fully realize the fruits of their labor**, and **do so
on earth**]{.underline}.44 [As the spread of ruling relations moved
across the planet, so too did communities committed to
revolution]{.underline}. [[When]{.mark} the [imperial elites]{.mark} in
Europe [expanded]{.mark} their territorial claims]{.underline}---and
processes of expropriation and exploitation [to]{.underline} the
Caribbean, the Americas, and [the rest of the
planet]{.underline}---[**[new communities of resistance]{.mark}** across
these spaces [were formed on the basis of **radical
solidarities**]{.mark}. [Revolutionaries from spaces **now imagined
separately**]{.mark}]{.underline} as Europe, Africa, the Caribbean, the
Americas, Asia, and the Pacific [encountered one another
and]{.underline}, in many cases, [**[saw]{.mark} in each other's
experiences** a [desire for their **own common
emancipation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The motley crew, then, was very much a cluster of new world
formations---new world because they stretched across the entire global
field of power of expanding imperial states. [[They **explicitly
challenged**]{.mark} emergent [discourses of]{.mark} their **innate
[noncommensurability]{.mark}**]{.underline}, be it racialized,
nationalized, or gendered lines of difference. As a result, as Linebaugh
and Rediker uncover, [[these **solidarities** were considered]{.mark} as
[the **greatest threat**]{.mark} against the aspirations of the newly
emerging [elites]{.mark}]{.underline}---the traders, ship owners, slave
owners, plantation owners, and leaders of imperial states.
Significantly, [it was **ideas**---and **[subjective
identifications]{.mark}**---of **nation**, **race**, and **gender** that
[**severely weakened** this "**many-headed hydra**]{.mark}" and **set
back its revolution**]{.underline}.

It is precisely [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} revolution, this "root
expansion in thought," that Sylvia Wynter ignites with her **[[call for
a human species]{.underline}]{.mark}**--wide sense of conspecificity. In
her essay "1492: A New World View," Sylvia Wynter [**creates an
imaginative space** for a **new** and **expansive subjective
understanding** of who "**we**" are so that we [can **undo the**]{.mark}
**continued [exclusionary]{.mark}**, **uneven**, and **purposefully
divisive [legacy]{.mark}** of 1492. While those who **shamelessly
celebrate** the aftermath of 1492]{.underline} continue to [believe that
they can act unilaterally and with impunity]{.underline} against groups
they have identified as native and migrants with no consequence to their
own lives, [and while some native nationalists believe that the **nos of
natives** is a **liberatory one**]{.underline} that will lead to a
postcolonial state of their own, Wynter's "new world view" allows us to
see that [both [partial perspectives]{.mark} are **ideological**.
Neither **reflects the lived experiences** of people the world over,
which are organized through both **shared experience** and **tangible
connection**]{.underline}. As a result, [[neither is able to **seize the
revolutionary promise** of an **expansion** in our]{.mark} **empathic**
and **[affective ties]{.mark}** with those with whom we live our
lives]{.underline}.

Wynter, by [[**defining humanness** as]{.mark} a **social**,
**historical**, and **discursive [coproduction]{.mark}**]{.underline}
rather than merely a biological one, [[urges us to become **cognitive
revolutionaries**, to]{.mark} see our potential to [**forge social
relationships** with one another]{.mark}---relationships that
**recognize** not only the **massive changes** wrought by]{.underline}
the events following Columbus's voyage of [1492 but also the
**possibility of what we can do** with these changes]{.underline}. The
New World produced new social formations, and it is within these social
formations that struggles for decolonization have taken place and
continue to and need to take place. [This **does not mean** that we
**must make a choice** between the **celebrants'
universality**]{.underline}, which is little but a parochial concern of
elites, [or the **alternative of dissidents** that romanticizes an
essentialized "community" set in battle against its others]{.underline}.
Rather, [[we can]{.underline}]{.mark}, if we choose, [**reject both
views** and **reorient ourselves**---and [**respatialize
ourselves**---with]{.mark} one **afforded to us** by [the **world that
we have inherited**]{.mark}, a world **[wrought with strife]{.mark}**
and **inequality** [but a **single world**, nonetheless]{.mark}. [This
project **is** and **always has been**, by **necessity**]{.mark}, a
**[shared]{.mark} one**]{.underline}. Indeed, the making of new social
bodies is not an epistemological problem but an ontological one. [It is
[in the **ontological unity** of our **human intra-actions**]{.mark}
that we can come into being what we already are: a **species of
humans**]{.underline}, one, no less, that is [**intimately involved with
all other life** on our shared planet]{.underline}.

### Link---Settler Colonialism---Ontology

#### Sweeping theories of radical indigenous ontological difference ignore the [nuances]{.underline} of [actual struggles]{.underline} that [strategically repurpose settler categories]{.underline} 

**Rosenow, 19**---Senior Lecturer in International Relations at Oxford
Brookes University (Doerthe, "Decolonising the Decolonisers? Of
Ontological Encounters in the GMO Controversy and Beyond," Global
Society, 33:1, 82-99, dml)

Despite the force and importance of this argument, I have felt slightly
uneasy when reading those conclusions. [[Focusing on **radical
ontological difference**]{.mark} can **easily [lead]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} a **romanticised [reification]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} other
peoples' [difference]{.mark} that is **[in danger of ignoring
actual]{.mark} political [struggles]{.mark}** [and **demands on the
ground**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Cusicanqui argues, [[those]{.mark}
struggles **[might]{.mark} very well [emerge]{.mark}** [out of an
"**indigenous modernity**", **rather than**]{.mark} **an
[insistence]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the **right to one's
[difference]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By this she means that [[some
Indigenous people]{.mark} aim to **[formulate a hegemonic
vision]{.mark}** for how to structure a society that is **[valid for
everyone]{.mark}** (Indigenous **AND** non-Indigenous)]{.underline}:
they work for a society that is in their "image and likeness",
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[**use modern notions** such as
"**citizenship**"]{.mark} for this purpose, [rather than
**rejecting**]{.mark} **the latter [as irreconcilable]{.mark} with one's
own world**]{.underline}.39 By contrast, [some]{.underline} North
American Indigenous [intellectuals call for an Indigenous
"**resurgence**" that, **rather than seeking hegemony**, altogether
**turns away from seeking recognition** by wider (colonial)
"society"]{.underline}. As Leanne Betasamosake Simpson points out, [in
such "resurgent mobilization ... there is **virtually no room for white
people**".]{.underline} 40

But my unease was also emerging from something else, which is what I
want to focus on in this article: the problem that encounters and
conflicts are yet again made sense of within overarching structures of
knowledge production rather than cultivation (despite the intention to
do otherwise). As de la Cadena herself makes clear in the quotation
above, what is encountered as "different" is inevitably described "in
forms that I could understand" (my emphasis)---even whilst
simultaneously recognising that one's description does not capture what
the encountered practices actually do. Sense-making, for de la Cadena,
takes place at what could be called two levels: At a first level, there
is the inevitable process of making sense of an alienating affective
experience on the spot, from within one's own framework of understanding
the world. At a second level, then, de la Cadena attempts to make
legible her grappling and not-understanding in the context of a book for
an academically literate and interested audience---in other words, in
the writing-up of her ethnographic research.

In Rojas' and Blaney and Tickner's case, given that their articles do
not aim to make an empirical contribution, sense-making takes place at
what could be called a third level: what is drawn upon is the
understanding that emerged out of the ethnographic work of others, which
is brought into conversation with various bodies of theoretical work in
order to make a conceptual contribution. This takes place via the
coining of central concepts and the outlining of all-encompassing
frameworks that are meant to help us understand the analytical,
normative and political consequences of their argument for scholarly
work more broadly. The ontological encounters of others are used to
delineate the merits of ontological encounters in general, in IR and
beyond. This objective leads to a particular way of developing and
structuring a generic argument that makes it difficult to move beyond
sense-making frameworks that are necessarily geared towards settling all
those unsettling and disconcerting experiences that were the focus of
the articles in the first place.

[This is]{.underline} also [the problem of some **central decolonial
work**]{.underline}. Drawing on Edouard Glissant, Mignolo, for example,
critiques the "requirement of transparency" that forms the basis for
understanding in Western social science scholarship. He argues for [the
"**right to opacity**" of those located on the **other side of the
colonial difference**]{.underline}.41 But this claim sits at odds with
his simultaneous desire to write a new, all-encompassing history of "the
modern/colonial world system". 42 And like in Rojas' and Blaney and
Tickner's articles, terms such as "pluriversality"43 or "diversality"44
[are coined in order to have a (**one!**) concept for a **similarly
all-encompassing solution** to domination]{.underline}. While de la
Cadena is critical of her own "anxiety to understand coherently (with
which I meant clearly and without contradiction"), and while she points
out how [this]{.underline} "was often out of place", 45 Mignolo as well
as Rojas and Blaney and Tickner [seek to place]{.underline} such
[anxiety in **yet another coherent framework** that **holds everything
together**]{.underline}.

The question arises whether this can be any different in scholarly work
that is not directly based on ethnographic research itself, and which
can therefore not lay claim to a direct experience of ontological
controversies. This has become an important question for my own
(likewise third-level) work on anti-GMO activism. My work to date has
primarily aimed at making a conceptual contribution, and has relied on a
conversation between the ethnographic research of others and various
bodies of conceptual work, including decolonial and "ontological turn"
literature.46

But as I have already indicated in relation to de la Cadena's work, when
writing up their research for academic purposes, even those who have
directly experienced ontological encounters find it hard to resist the
tendency to conclude their work with stringent, overarching, coherent
conclusions that the Westerneducated reader can grasp and "take home".
In the next section, I will draw on two anthropological ethnographic
texts that are significant for research on the GMO controversy to show
how this works. The two texts that will be analysed in the next section
engage with the GMO controversy in Paraguay and Mexico respectively, and
they have stood out for me in the way they manage to convey a sense of
unease and grappling with ontological encounters and conflicts. However,
as the next section will show, they as well end up providing a framework
and conclusions that can accommodate and make sense of the encountered
ontological difference.

3\. Ontological Encounters in the GMO Controversy

According to Susana Carro-Ripalda and Marta Astier, much of the research
that is carried out in relation to the question of what smallholder
producers in the Global South truly think of (and say about)
agricultural biotechnology is unable to grasp the "ontological
incompatibility" that exists between the experienced human/nonhuman
relations in small-scale agriculture on the one hand, and the logic that
underlies genetic engineering (GE) on the other.47 This is precisely
because most social research is itself grounded in the crucial
modern/colonial nature-culture divide: the former can only be known
through scientific means, while the latter can be known through the
study of social/cultural/political practices. Knowledge about nature is
about establishing "facts", which are either true or false (i.e. nature
as "one" is either correctly or incorrectly represented), while
knowledge about culture is about studying meaning, which is necessarily
(due to the existence of different cultures) multiple.

The question of whether GMOs do or do not pose a "factual" danger
consequently lies outside of the remit of the social sciences, which
therefore focus on the social dimension of statements that are made
about nature. But as Kregg Hetherington's reflections on his own
anthropological research journey in Paraguay make clear, this tacit
signing-up to modern ontology can lead to difficulties in understanding
the reality of the people one is interested in.48 Coming from a position
in which he took for granted the scientific distinction between (proven)
"fact" and "error", Hetherington explains how he "translate\[d\]" the
claims of the leader of a local peasant movement49 (Antonio) about the
truth of (GM) soy "killer beans" into something else:

Until this point, I had approached ethnography as an extended discussion
with and about humans, and I was less interested in beans than I was
with what Antonio said about them ... To be blunt, Antonio kept pointing
at the beans, and I kept looking at him ... I was comfortable saying
that this was a figure of speech, a kind of political rhetoric, or even
to claim that this is what Antonio believed, all of which explicitly
framed 'la soja mata' (soy kills) as data for social analysis, rather
than analysis itself worthy of response.50

However, Hetherington points out that not believing in the truth of the
killer bean did not prevent him from "participating in Antonio's
knowledge practices". 51 Becoming involved in the anti-soy bean activism
of the peasants, Hetherington became "part of the situation" that made
the killer bean turn into a crucial agent in a court case that was
brought against two soy farmers for the murder of two activist peasants.
As a result, killer beans became transformed into a matter of national
concern. Crucially for Hetherington, participation involved more than
joining the situation in spite of his lack of belief: it led to him
becoming immersed in a relation with both peasants and beans that
started to have a physical impact on him---in de la Cadena's words, he
indeed became "partially connected": 52

Beans didn't scare me at first. Indeed, as a foreigner to the situation
that gives rise to killer beans (a Canadian no less), giant fields of
soy were a familiar, even a comforting sight. But it took only a few
months with Antonio for me to start feeling the menace from those
fields. Soon, the sweetish smell of glyphosate, recently applied, and
especially the corpselike smell of 2, 4-D mixed with Tordon, could ruin
my appetite and make me expect to see people emerge from their homes to
show me pustules on their legs and stomachs.53

Similar observations are also found in Carro-Ripalda and Astier's
contribution to the 2014 Agriculture and Human Values symposium on the
challenges of making smallholder producer voices being heard in relation
to agricultural biotechnology.54 While most of the contributions to the
symposium concentrate on how to tease out smallholders' "real" voices in
the most effective way, Carro-Ripalda and Astier critically reflect on
their own perceived failure to become knowledgeable about smallholders'
voices in their research on GM maize cultivation in Mexico.

It was through ethnographic fieldwork in rural areas in Central Mexico,
in-depth structured interviews, focus groups, participant observation
and, finally, a National Workshop in Mexico City with over 50
stakeholders (including smallholder producers) that Carro-Ripalda and
Astier attempted to get a better sense of what the actual voices of
peasants in the GM controversy were trying to convey.55 However,
particularly the final workshop, which aimed to create conditions under
which Mexican smallholder producers could speak on their own terms about
GM maize cultivation, "unwittingly reproduced the conditions of
exclusive, techno-scientific and regulatory spaces". 56 The public
discourse that centres on questions of safety, science, possibilities of
regulation and problems of potential contamination, and which is upheld
by both GM maize proponents and antiGMO activists, dominated the
workshop debate. Even when present smallholders raised different
concerns, the discussion always returned to the previous, main ones, as
if those who had spoken differently "had not spoken at all". The way
that smallholders could articulate "their perceptions, ideas, and
desires" was thereby "severely limited". 57

Carro-Ripalda and Astier are focused on the dominance of one particular
(techno-scientific, regulatory) discourse that, they maintain, disabled
smallholder voices engaged in different discourses from speaking up or,
when speaking, from being heard. In other words, smallholders were
unable to adequately represent their own understanding of what is at
stake in the GM maize controversy in Mexico. Considering what I have
pointed out in the previous section, based on Rojas, difference is
thereby transformed into an epistemological, rather than an ontological
one: Carro-Ripalda and Astier's argument is implicitly based on the
assumption that, under the right conditions, difference can be
translated into something that can be communicated to, and discussed
with, other stakeholders. But the term "ontological incompatibility"
that the authors themselves use indicates there is something else at
play, which cannot easily be translated: the nature of the relation of
smallholder producers to their "land, seed, crop, climate ... as told
and understood by themselves"; the "central place" that Maize continues
to occupy in Mesoamerican pre-Hispanic cosmology, and "the social and
cultural significance" that goes along with that.58

Carro-Ripalda and Astier's emphasis on the problem of the dominant
discourse, and the overarching Mexican structures of domination this
discourse is related to (such as the "neoliberal vision of the Mexican
agricultural future"59), makes it occasionally difficult to understand
what the problem of "ontological incompatibility" really is about. At
the end of the article, the place of the smallholder producers whom they
have engaged seems once again clearly delineated and knowable: at stake
for smallholders are, Carro-Ripalda and Astier argue, "their lives as
maize cultivators, their pride in their craft and knowledge, and their
ceremonially demanded right to information, choice and access to their
'own resources'". It is not just about "retaining 'traditional' ways of
agriculture", as the anti-GMO movement maintains, but also about
claiming "political, economic and socio-cultural rights."60 Though this
certainly adds a significant dimension to the debate, it indeed simply
seems to add to, rather than radically challenge, the frameworks that
are conventionally used in the anti-GMO debate, as well as the
frameworks that focus on how to bring out and represent other people's
"voices" in a better way. Is this simply unavoidable when it comes to
the production of academic knowledge through/in academic writing? As
already indicated in the previous section, academic writing pursues by
definition the objective of enhancing knowledge and providing improved
insight into a certain situation. In its very structure, an academic
piece of work aims to resolve and settle, rather than to dislocate, to
destabilise, or to provide discomfort.

Carro-Ripalda and Astier's article is meant to render legible their own
encounter of ontological difference for an academic audience. Is it
possible for the reader to dig below these representational strategies,
and to relate more directly to their encounter of what they themselves
call ontological incompatibility? And which has led them to brand their
final workshop, in a quite un-academic way, as a "failure"? There are a
few places in the article in which their inability to put into words and
arguments all of "the complexity of experiences, relations and reasons
that bind people to maize"61 is more obvious. Becoming attuned to this
complexity is linked to the authors having to become at least "partially
connected"---to yet again use de la Cadena's phrase---to the relations
they attempt to trace. It is interesting, for example, that
Carro-Ripalda and Astier talk about "voices" as going beyond the
semantic level, as conveying something acoustically, and as requiring a
form of listening that shies away from asking pre-given questions. It is
also interesting that some of that took place when they literally walked
together with their interlocutors; precisely as it is emphasised by
Blaney and Tickner:62

Despite the shortcomings of the workshop ... we felt that that, through
our research on the ground, we had engaged with male and female farmers,
heard about their perspectives on GM and their visions of a rural
future, and accompanied them to work in milpas and markets. So, what do
smallholder farmers' voices sound like? What meanings did they convey to
us? We will provide here but a few of those sounds and meanings ... 63

Despite returning to the idea of voices as conveying "meaning" in this
quote, meaning is related to sounds, to walking together, to particular
places with their own sounds, smells, and colours. The sample of actual
"voices" Carro-Ripalda and Astier then choose to present yet again
invoke an intricate sense of the relationality of farmers and nonhumans:

It is a joy to plant, getting hold of the maize, of a beautiful cob
which is pleasant, to go to the harvest, to look at pretty cobs, all
regular. Because this is what sustains me.

You can see the difference in the seeds straight away ... You need to
look at the cob and as soon as I grab it I see the difference.

It is the person who knows the seed the one who chooses it \[for
replanting the following year\].64

By contrast, GM maize is associated by the smallholders whom
Carro-Ripalda and Astier cite with feelings of "artificiality,
estrangement and distrust towards the created object (the GMO) in
itself, not only because of deep ontological considerations ... but
because of the political and economic motives which are 'assembled' into
it."65 Although the authors make a distinction between ontology and
politics/ economics here, their invoking of the "assemblage" precisely
shows how the latter becomes part of ontology itself, and then (as in
the case of Hetherington) impacts on the sensual, bodily connection with
the maize. Understanding the relation between "things" in this way
allows for an analysis of power and domination that has at least the
potential of moving beyond pre-given frameworks; strategically
suspending them in order to "sharpen \[the\] analysis of exactly how
power operates, how relations are made and undermined, and with what
consequences". 66 Genetically modified maize is a problem because it is
part of particular Mexican neoliberal visions and strategies, but in the
context outlined by Carro-Ripalda and Astier, that vision is not only
(and not even primarily) made sense of through given frames of
knowledge, such as Marxist theories of the exploitation of labour, but
sensually, through the way it disrupts the (physical) pleasure and joy
that has sustained the farmer-maize-assemblage so far.67 GM technology
externalises the maize from farmers and estrange them from their ways of
life; and it is only through this externalisation that GM maize becomes
perceivable as a potential source of "contamination", as a danger
against which farmers need to "defend" their seeds.68

Now, some might counter that the previous paragraph in practice only
provides a fancy repackaging of the two well-rehearsed arguments brought
forward by many anti-GMO activists: (a) that the problem of GMOs is an
intrinsic property that makes it "unsafe" (which activists try to
scientifically prove), and/or (b) that the fundamental problem of
agricultural biotechnology is that it estranges farmers from their
traditional, ancestral way of life, that it allows for their
exploitation, and that it provides a further foothold for neoliberal
visions of how the world should be ordered. Both arguments are grounded
in modern ontology: the first goes down the route of science (contesting
"facts" about the "nature" of GMOs on the basis of science itself),
while the second goes down the "social" route by either making a case
for the need to respect cultural multiplicity, or for the need to
prevent economic exploitation. Some activists make use of all of these
routes and arguments. Famous environmental activist and intellectual
Vandana Shiva, for example, determines the alienating character of the
GMO to be an intrinsic property, while at the same time depicting
smallholder producers as intrinsic "'reservoirs' of local or indigenous
knowledge or as 'natural' conservators of biodiversity through their
traditional practices". 69 According to Carro-Ripalda and Astier, this
"unwittingly reinforce\[es\] images of smallholder producers as passive,
timeless and voiceless."70 This leads to precisely the sort of
romanticised reification of "difference" that I have critiqued in the
previous section of this article---paradoxically, in this case, on the
basis of an ontology that is deeply modern, as it regards both "things"
and "people" as ontologically stable and classifiable.

By contrast, the authors of the two texts I have analysed in this
section trace ontological encounters that cannot be contained by the
nature/culture dichotomy. There is no pre-given (social) theory of
neoliberalism and global power relations that dictates how the "voice"
of the farmer needs to be made sense of. There is also no pregiven
understanding of the "factual" (scientific) nature of GMOs. The notion
of radical difference that comes up in these two texts emerged from
precisely the "misunderstandings" that the encounter of ethnographers
with "other people" and their relations brought to the fore; but
importantly, it did not make any clearer to the ethnographer what the
"stuff" that grounded the misunderstandings is actually composed of.71
Yet, somewhat paradoxically, despite all this emphasis on
misunderstandings, incompatibility, grappling, failure, and critical
self-reflection of one's own assumptions---at the end of the day what is
left for the readers (at least if they do not explicitly focus on the
"ethnographic excess" found in the writings) is the impression that they
know more about "stuff" than they did before: that they understand the
situation better, that new knowledge has been produced, that the object
of analysis is more transparent than it has been before. How can this
subjugation of the encountered ontologically difference to academic
strategies of comprehensive sense-making avoided (if at all)?

This article itself is now coming up to what would normally be a
conclusion---i.e. the treacherous waters of nailing its contribution to
knowledge. Given that this article is yet again another "third-level"
engagement with questions of ontology and decoloniality, the question is
whether there is any way to avoid this pull of hegemonic modes of
academic knowledge production. Rather than providing a conclusion and
reiterate the core argument that the article has made, I will attempt to
finish this piece by raising even more questions, and by providing some
further reflections.

4\. Turtles all the Way Down: (Further) Reflections on What Questions to
Ask

The pull of hegemonic systems of academic knowledge production is
difficult to avoid. This is the case even in writings that are directly
based on ontological encounters and controversies, and that reflect on
the displacement that encountering different ontologies has entailed.
But as I have indicated, this problem is even more pronounced in
writings---like my own---that provide what I have previously called
"third-level" sense-making of ontological encounters.

The contribution of third-level analysis is usually a conceptual one,
which makes it by definition veer towards the general and abstract
rather than the concrete. In relation to the literature on decolonial
thought and the ontological turn, this becomes manifest in three
different (yet interrelated) ways: first, in the desire to provide an
understanding of ontology that enables a conceptualisation of the former
as multiple. Drawing on the work of Mario Blaser and Eduardo Viveiros de
Castro respectively, Rojas and Blaney and Tickner argue that ontology
can be thought of as multiple if reality is understood as always being
"enacted" or "performed". 72 This is what Blaser calls an understanding
of ontology as "materialsemiotic": one that defines reality as "always
in the making through the dynamic relations of hybrid assemblages". 73
Pinpointing it like this is inevitably geared towards answering the
question of what reality as such, in general is about. Secondly, there
is an ambition to coin the general normative-political project that
arises out of this understanding with a singular concept, such as the
pluriverse. Thirdly, arguments about ontological multiplicity and the
emancipatory-decolonial political projects that arise out of its
recognition are written for an audience of a particular discipline, such
as IR: the aim is to provide a wholesale, general rethinking, or,
indeed, "reconstruction" of the latter.74

What sort of questions drive conceptual work into that direction, and
what desire "to know" underlies the questions? According to Cherokee
philosopher Brian Yazzie Burkhart, for Native Americans "the questions
we choose to ask are more important than any truths we might hope to
discover in asking such questions". 75 By contrast, Western knowledge is
always (at least in the mainstream) propositional knowledge: "knowledge
of the form 'that something is so'". Here, knowledge cannot be verified
by referring to direct experiences: "there must be something underlying
them and justifying them". 76 Burkhart gives the example of the "routine
response" given by "Western people" to Indigenous accounts of creation:
"In \[one\] account, the earth rests on the back of a turtle. The
Western response to this account is simply the question, 'What holds the
turtle?'" This question makes no sense to the Native storyteller,
because the truth of the story lies in the paths to rightful action that
it outlines, rather than what it has to say about the "reality" of the
world. But when the Westerner insists on the question, the answer
finally is: "'Well, then there must be turtles all the way down'."77

Equating Rojas' and Blaney and Tickner's work with European mainstream
(hence analytic) philosophy seems, at first glance, incredibly unfair.
After all, those authors precisely advocate the cultivating of knowledge
by direct awareness or acquaintance in exactly the way that Burkhart
identifies as typical for Native Americans. But on the other hand, the
framework that circumscribes their emphasis on the need for
"concreteness" is still an abstract one that wants to answer the
question of how things really are and should be: enacted, performed,
pluriversal, ... The point is not whether this argument about reality
and politics is right or wrong. The point is to recognise that it is
driven by particular questions that might make no sense in the context
of other intelligence systems, but that need to be addressed in an
academic article in order to make a conceptual argument compelling,
convincing and original for an audience that primarily sits (whether it
likes it or not) within a Western, colonial, hegemonic system of
knowledge production.78 And even when the contribution to knowledge
production is not primarily conceptual, as in the "second-level" work
that I have analysed in the previous section in relation to the GMO
controversy, the final argument that is made (e.g. about peasants'
economic and cultural rights) is yet again lucid and comprehensible to
an audience that seeks to comprehend "stuff" within modern parameters.

Where to go from here (particularly as a white, European scholar)? As
suggested by Tucker, one way might be to engage in much more direct,
ethnographic research, which would enable more direct experience of
ontological encounters. Despite previously-mentioned problems of even
that research not going far enough, there is without doubt more space
for providing a sense of grappling and dislocation if the originality of
a piece of work is not purely grounded in the conceptual contribution it
aims to make. However, not every scholar is able--- body-, context- or
funding-wise---to spend extensive periods of time in different places,
and the ethical and political pitfalls of researching "radical
difference" through fieldwork with---but often rather on---others have
been pointed out by Indigenous scholars numerous times.79

But even for those unable or unwilling to do more primary, empirical
research, there is space to push the boundaries of what can and should
be written about (and how). For decades there have been attempts to
provide "innovative" platforms, for example at conferences, to talk
about "stuff" in different ways (e.g. through storytelling or artistic
practices; not at least by e.g. Indigenous peoples themselves80).
However, these "innovations" are still at the margins, and they will
most likely never be able to compete with acknowledged knowledge
production outlets such as journal articles and scholarly books. But
even within the latter, there is always at least some space to push for
more open-endedness, more reflection on the author's embodied
positionality, more auto-critique, more uncertainty and grappling (even
if this is based on reading about the ontological encounters of others).

Although this sort of embodied self-reflection on a writer's
"situatedness" (which in my own case means being "on the colonising side
of a divide"81) has obviously been advanced by many critical scholars
for decades (including feminists and post- as well as decolonial
scholars), this article has hopefully shown that [there is still
(**always**) a **need to go further**, in order to **more fundamentally
challenge hegemonic**, **modern/colonial modes** of knowledge
production]{.underline}. The sense of unease that I have outlined in
section two was particularly strong when reading conclusions that were
geared towards making recommendations for the discipline of IR, or for
"international politics", as such. [[Aiming to **make generic
conclusions for** ]{.mark}**entire disciplines**, **political fields**,
or [global "**issues**" **pushes**]{.mark} **the generality** and
**[abstraction]{.mark}** of a contribution **even [further
away]{.mark}** [from an **advocacy of the
concrete**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why, and to whom, does it matter
whether IR, as a discipline, or international politics, as object of
study, becomes more pluriversal or not? What are the actual benefits of
the concept of the pluriverse in the first place? Or to pick up the
theme of this special issue: why does it matter whether IR is, or should
move into, a mode of affirmation rather than critique?82 Why is this a
good question to ask---and for whom? [[This]{.mark} is **not just a
theoretical problem**, but it [has **real-life consequences for
actually-existing decolonial struggles**. The desire for **making a
generic argument** about relational ontologies]{.mark} and a pluriversal
politics [**harbours the danger of making a huge variety of demands**
and **struggles**]{.mark} **that often exist [in tension]{.mark}** and
**contradiction** [with each other
**commensurable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indigenous demands for the
repatriation of "their" land might be at odds with the social justice
demands for redistribution and "the commons". 83 For Blaney and Tickner,
decolonial thought is commensurable with not just the ontological turn
literature, but also feminist and other critical interventions.84
Mignolo and Arturo Escobar advocate a transnational fight for global
justice and are enthusiastic about the potential of global movements to
achieve that aim together.85 Like Mignolo, Rojas explicitly draws on the
World Social Forum slogan "Another world is possible" as well as the
Zapatistas slogan of "a world where many words fit" to make her case
about the need for a pluriversal understanding of
emancipatory-decolonial politics.86 [While]{.underline} it can be argued
that [[this]{.mark} problem of **seeing all these struggles** and
**demands as commensurable** [goes back to a **lack of actual engagement
with particular** ]{.mark}**decolonial [practices]{.mark}** and
**battles**]{.underline}, what I have argued in this article is that
[[it is also related to]{.mark} the problem of **how** and [**what sort
of knowledge is produced** and **valued** in the Western academy:
knowledge that is **abstract**, **generic**, and **applicable beyond a
specific context**]{.mark}. Knowledge that is **driven** by the desire
to **know what is**.]{.underline} Knowledge that desires to know what
holds the turtle---all the way down.

### Link---Settler Colonialism---Pessimism

#### Their understanding of the state as unified, immutable, and inevitably dangerous to Indigenous actors creates a [pessimism trap]{.underline} that [stifles]{.underline} Indigenous agency and activism. 

**Lightfoot, 20**---associate professor in First Nations and Indigenous
Studies and the Department of Political Science, University of British
Columbia, Ojibwe (Sheryl, "The Pessimism Traps of Indigenous
Resurgence," *Pessimism in International Relations*, Chapter 9, pp
162-170, SpringerLink, dml)

[Pessimism Trap 2: The State is **Unified**, **Deliberate** and
**Unchanging** in Its Desire to **Dispossess**]{.underline} Indigenous
Peoples [and **Gain Unfettered Access** to Indigenous Lands]{.underline}
and Resources

[In other words, colonialism by settler states is a **constant**, **not
a variable**, in both **outcome** and **intent**]{.underline}. Further,
the state is not only intentionally colonial, but it is also unifed in
its desire to co-opt Indigenous peoples as a method and means of
control.

In 2005's Wasase, Alfred presents the state as unitary, intentional and
unchanging in its desire to colonise and oppress Indigenous peoples
noting, 'I think that the only thing that has changed since our
ancestors first declared war on the invaders is that some of us have
lost heart'.22 Referring to current state policies as a
'self-termination movement', Alfred states, 'It is senseless to advocate
for an accord with imperialism while there is a steady and intense
ongoing attack by the Settler society on everything meaningful to us:
our cultures, our communities, and our deep attachments to land'.23

Alfred's Peace, Power, Righteousness (2009) also argues that the state
is deliberate and unchanging, stating quite plainly that 'it is still
the objective of the Canadian and US governments to remove Indians, or,
failing that, to prevent them from benefitting, from their ancestral
territories'.24 Contemporary states do this, he argues, not through
outright violent control but 'by insidiously promoting a form of
neo-colonial self-government in our communities and forcing our
integration into the legal mainstream'.25 According to Alfred, the state
'relegates indigenous peoples' rights to the past, and constrains the
development of their societies by allowing only those activities that
support its own necessary illusion: that indigenous peoples today do not
present a serious challenge to its legitimacy'.26

Linking back to the aim of co-option, Alfred argues that while the
state's desire to control Indigenous peoples and lands has never
changed, the techniques for doing so have become subtler over time.
'Recognizing the power of the indigenous challenge and unable to deny it
a voice', due to successful Indigenous resistance over the years, 'the
state has (now) attempted to pull indigenous people closer to it'.27
According to Alfred, the state has outwitted Indigenous leaders and
'encouraged them to reframe and moderate their nationhood demands to
accept the fait accompli of colonization, (and) to collaborate in the
development of a "solution" that does not challenge the fundamental
imperial lie'.28

In a similar vein, Coulthard's central argument is centred on his
understanding of the dual structure of colonialism. Drawing directly
from Fanon, Coulthard finds that colonialism relies on both objective
and subjective elements. The objective components involve domination
through the political, economic and legal structures of the colonial
state. The subjective elements of colonialism involve the creation of
'colonized subjects', including a process of internalisation by which
colonised subjects come to not only accept the limited forms of
'misrecognition' granted through the state but can even come to identify
with it.29 Through this dual structure, colonial power now works through
the inclusion of Indigenous peoples, actively shaping their perspectives
in line with state discourses, rather than merely excluding them, as in
years past. Therefore, any attempt to seek 'the reconciliation of
Indigenous nationhood with state sovereignty is still colonial insofar
as it remains structurally committed to the dispossession of Indigenous
peoples of our lands and self-determining authority'.30

Concerning the state in relation to Indigenous peoples on the
international level, Corntassel argues that states and global
organisations, for years, have been consistently framing Indigenous
peoples' self-determination claims in ways that 'jeopardize the futures
of indigenous communities'.31 He claims that states frst
compartmentalise Indigenous self-determination by separating lands and
resources from political and legal recognition of a limited autonomy.
Second, he notes, states sometimes deny the existence of Indigenous
peoples living within their borders. Thirdly, a political and legal
entitlement framing by states deemphasises other responsibilities.
Finally, he claims that states, through the rights discourse, limit the
frameworks through which Indigenous peoples can seek self-determination.
Like Alfred and Coulthard, Corntassel has concluded that states are
deliberate and never changing in their behaviour. With [this
move]{.underline}, Corntassel [**limits** and actually **demeans
Indigenous agency**, **overlooking** the reality that **Indigenous
organisations themselves** chose the **human rights framework** and
**rights discourse** as a target sphere of action **precisely because**,
as was **evident** in earlier struggles like **slavery**, **civil
rights** or **women's rights**, these were **tools available to them**
that had a **proven track record of opening up new possibilities** and
**shifting previous state positions** and **behaviour**. Indigenous
advocates also **cleverly realised**]{.underline}, by the 1970s, [that
the **anti-discrimination** and **decolonisation frames** could be
**used together against states**. States did, **in no way**,
**nefariously impose a rights framework** on Indigenous peoples. Rather,
Indigenous organisations and savvy Indigenous political actors
**deliberately chose** to frame their self-determination struggles
**within the human rights framework** in order to **bring states into a
double bind** where they **could not credibly claim** to adhere to human
rights and claim that they uphold equality while **simultaneously
denying Indigenous peoples' human rights** and leaving them with a
**diminished** and **unequal right of self-determination**]{.underline}.
But, because he is caught in [the pessimism trap of **seeing the state
only as unified**, **deliberate** and **unchanging**]{.underline},
Corntassel [**overlooks** and **diminishes** the clear story of
**Indigenous agency** and the **potential for positive change** in
advancing self-determination in a multitude of ways]{.underline}.

[Pessimism Trap 3: **Engagement** with the Settler State is
**Futile**]{.underline}, if Not Counter-Productive

[Since the state always intends to **maintain**, if not **expand**,
**colonial control**]{.underline}, and is seeking to co-opt as many
Indigenous peoples as possible in order to maintain or expand its
dispossession and control, [it is therefore **futile**]{.underline}, at
best, [and]{.underline} actually [**dangerous** to Indigenous existence
to engage with the state]{.underline}. Furthermore, [**all patterns of
engagement** will lead to **co-optation** as the state is **cunning**
and **unrelenting** in its desire to co-opt]{.underline} Indigenous
leaders, academics and professionals in order to gain or maintain
control of [Indigenous peoples]{.underline}.

Alfred argues, in both his 2005 and 2009 books, that any Indigenous
engagement with the state, including agreements and negotiations, is not
only futile but fundamentally dangerous, as such pathways do not
directly challenge the existing colonial structure and 'to argue on
behalf of indigenous nationhood within the dominant Western paradigm is
self-defeating'.32 Alfred states that a 'notion of nationhood or
self-government rooted in state institutions and framed within the
context of state sovereignty can never satisfy the imperatives of Native
American political traditions'33 because the possibility for a true
expression of Indigenous self-determination is 'precluded by the state's
insistence on dominion and its exclusionary notion of sovereignty'.34
Worst of all, according to Alfred, when Indigenous communities frame
their struggles in terms of asserting Aboriginal rights and title, but
do so within a state framework, rather than resisting the state itself,
it 'represents the culmination of white society's efforts to assimilate
indigenous peoples'.35

Because it is impossible to advance Indigenous self-determination
through any sort of engagement with the state, Coulthard also advocates
for an Indigenous resurgence paradigm that follows both his mentor
Taiaiake Alfred but also Anishinaabe feminist theorist Leanne Simpson.36
As Coulthard writes, 'both Alfred and Simpson start from a position that
calls on Indigenous peoples and communities to "turn away" from the
assimilative reformism of the liberal recognition approach and to
instead build our national liberation efforts on the revitalization of
"traditional" political values and practices'.37 Drawing upon the
prescriptive approach of these theorists, Coulthard proposes, in his
concluding chapter, five theses from his analysis that are intended to
build and solidify Indigenous resurgence into the future:

1\. On the necessity of direct action, meaning that physical forms of
Indigenous resistance, like protest and blockades, are very important
not only as a reaction to the state but also as a means of protecting
the lands that are central to Indigenous peoples' existence;

2\. Capitalism, No More!, meaning the rejection of capitalist forms of
economic development in Indigenous communities in favour of land-based
Indigenous political-economic alternative approaches;

3\. Dispossession and Indigenous Sovereignty in the City, meaning the
need for Indigenous resurgence movements 'to address the interrelated
systems of dispossession that shape Indigenous peoples' experiences in
both urban and land-based settings'38;

4\. Gender Justice and Decolonisation, meaning that decolonisation must
also include a shift away from patriarchy and an embrace of gender
relations that are non-violent and refective of the centrality of women
in traditional forms of Indigenous governance and society; and

5\. Beyond the Nation-State. While Coulthard denies that he advocates
complete rejection of engagement with the state's political and legal
system, he does assert that 'our efforts to engage these discursive and
institutional spaces to secure recognition of our rights have not only
failed, but have instead served to subtly reproduce the forms of racist,
sexist, economic, and political confgurations of power that we initially
sought...to challenge'.39 He therefore advocates expressly for 'critical
self-refection, skepticism, and caution' in a 'resurgent politics of
recognition that seeks to practice decolonial, gender-emancipatory, and
economically nonexploitative alternative structures of law and sovereign
authority grounded on a critical refashioning of the best of Indigenous
legal and political traditions'.40

Corntassel also demonstrates the third pessimism trap, that all
engagement with the state is ultimately futile. For the most part,
however, Corntassel's observation is that the UN system operates like a
reverse Keck and Sikkink 'boomerang model' and 'channels the energies of
transnational Indigenous networks into the institutional fiefdoms of
member countries', by which an 'illusion of inclusion' is created.41 He
argues that, in order to be included or their views listened to,
Indigenous delegates at the UN must mimic the strategies, language,
norms and modes of behaviour of member states and international
institutions. Corntassel fnds that 'what results is a cadre of
professionalized Indigenous delegates who demonstrate more allegiance to
the UN system than to their own communities'.42 In his final analysis,
he charges that the co-optation of international Indigenous political
actors is highly 'effective in challenging the unity of the global
Indigenous rights movement and hindering genuine dialogue regarding
Indigenous self-determination and justice'.43

Finding that states deliberately co-opt and provide 'illusions of
inclusion' to Indigenous political actors in UN settings, Corntassel
comes to the same conclusion as Alfred concerning the futility of
engagement, arguing that because transnational Indigenous networks are
'channeled' and 'blunted' by colonial state actors, 'it is a critical
time for Indigenous peoples to rethink their approaches to bringing
Indigenous rights concerns to global forums'.44

Imagining a Post-Colonial Future: Pessimistic 'Resurgence' Versus
the Optimism and Tenacity of Indigenous Movements on the Ground

[All of these]{.underline} writers [advocate **Indigenous resurgence**,
through a combination of **rejecting**]{.underline} the current
reconciliation politics of [**settler colonial states**, coupled with a
**return to land-based Indigenous expressions** of governance as the
**only viable**, '**authentic**' and **legitimate path** to a better
future for Indigenous peoples, which they refer to as
**decolonisation**]{.underline}. While inherently critical in their
orientation, these three approaches do make some positive and productive
contributions to Indigenous movements. They help shed light on the
various and subtle ways that Indigenous leaders and communities can
become co-opted into a colonial system. They help us to hold leadership
accountable. They also help us keep a strong focus on our traditional,
cultural and spiritual values as well as our traditional forms of
governance which then also helps us imagine future possibilities.

As I have pointed out here, however, [all]{.underline} three theorists
[are]{.underline} also [**caught** in the]{.underline} same three
[**pessimism traps**: **authenticity versus co-option**; a vision of the
state as **unified**, **deliberate** and **never changing** in its
desire to **colonise** and **control**; and a view of engagement with
the state as **futile**, if not **dangerous**, to Indigenous sovereignty
and existence]{.underline}. When combined, [these]{.underline} three
pessimism [traps]{.underline} aim to [**inhibit Indigenous peoples'
engagement** with the state in **any process** that could potentially
**re-imagine** and **re-formulate** their current relationship into one
that could be **transformative** and **post-colonial**, as envisioned by
the **UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples**.
The]{.underline} pessimism [traps]{.underline} together work to
[**foreclose any possibility** that there could be **credible openings
of opportunity** to negotiate a **fairer** and **just relationship** of
co-existence with **even the most progressive state
government**.]{.underline}

[This]{.underline} pessimistic approach [is **not innocuous**. By
**overemphasising structure** and granting the state an **enormous
degree of agency** as a **unitary actor**, this]{.underline} pessimistic
approach [**does a remarkable disservice** to Indigenous resistance
movements by **proscribing**, from **academia**, an **extremely narrow
view** of what Indigenous self-determination **can** and **should mean**
in practice. By **overlooking** and/or **discounting Indigenous agency**
and **not even considering the possibility** that Indigenous peoples
**could themselves be calculating**, **strategic political actors** in
their own right, and vis-à-vis states, the pessimistic lens]{.underline}
of the resurgence school [**unnecessarily**, **unproductively** and
**unjustly limits the field of possibility** for Indigenous peoples'
decision-making, thus **actually countering** and **inhibiting
expressions of Indigenous self-determination**. By
**condemning**---**writ large**---**all Indigenous peoples** and
**organisations** that wish to **seek peaceful co-existence** with the
state, **negotiate mutually beneficial agreements** with the state,
and/or who have **advocated on the international level**
for]{.underline} a set of **[standards]{.underline}** that can provide a
positive guiding framework [for Indigenous-state relations, the
pessimistic lens]{.underline} of resurgence [**forecloses much potential
for new** and **improved relations**, in **any form**, and is **very
likely** to lead to **deeper conflicts** between states and Indigenous
peoples, and potentially, even **violent action**]{.underline}, which
Fanon indicated was the necessary outcome. [The pessimism
traps]{.underline} of the resurgence school [are therefore]{.underline},
likely [**self-defeating** for all but the **most remote** and
**isolated Indigenous communities**]{.underline}. Further, [this
approach is **quite out of step** with the **actions** and **vision of
many Indigenous resistance movements** on the ground who have been
**working for decades** to advance Indigenous self-determination, both
**domestically** and **globally**, in ways that **transform the colonial
state** into something **more just** and may eventually **present
creative alternatives** to the Westphalian state form in ways that could
**respect** and **accommodate Indigenous nations**]{.underline}. Rather,
[it aims to **shame** and **blame** those who wish to **explore
creative** and **innovative post-colonial resolutions** to the colonial
condition]{.underline}.

[The **UN Declaration**]{.underline} on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
(the Declaration or UN Declaration) was adopted by the General Assembly
in 2007 after 25 years of development. The Declaration [is
**ground-breaking**, given the **key leadership roles** Indigenous
peoples played in **negotiating** and **achieving** this
agreement]{.underline}.45 Additionally, for the first time in UN
history, the rights holders, [Indigenous peoples, **worked with states**
to develop an instrument that would serve to **promote**, **protect**
and **affirm Indigenous rights**, both **globally** and in **individual
domestic contexts**.]{.underline}46

[Many **Indigenous organisations** and **movements**, from **dozens of
countries** around the world, were **involved in drafting** and
**negotiating** the UN Declaration and are now **advocating for its full
implementation**, both **internationally** and in **domestic** and
**regional contexts**]{.underline}. In Canada, some of the key
organisational players---the Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee),
the Assembly of First Nations, and the Union of British Columbia Indian
Chiefs, or their predecessor organisations---were involved in the
drafting and lengthy negotiations of the UN Declaration during the
1980s, 1990s and 2000s. In the United States, organisations like the
American Indian Law Alliance and the Native American Rights Fund have
been involved as well as the Navajo Nation and the Haudenosaunee
Confederacy, who represent themselves as Indigenous peoples' governing
institutions. From Scandinavia, the Saami Council and the Sami
Parliaments all play a key role in advancing Indigenous rights. In Latin
America, organisations like the Confederación de Nationalidades
Indígenas del Ecuador (CONAIE) and the Consejo Indio de Sud America
(CISA) advocate for implementation of the UN Declaration. The three,
**[major transnational Indigenous organisations]{.underline}**--- the
World Council of Indigenous Peoples, the International Indian Treaty
Council and the Inuit Circumpolar Council---[were all **key members** of
the drafting and negotiating team for the UN Declaration,
and]{.underline} the latter two, which are still in existence,
[**continue their strong advocacy** for its full
implementation]{.underline}.

Implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
requires fundamental and significant change, on both the international
and domestic levels. Because implementation of Indigenous rights
essentially calls for a complete and fundamental restructuring of
Indigenous-state relationships, it expects states to enact and implement
a signifcant body of legal, constitutional, legislative and policy
changes that can accommodate such things as Indigenous land rights,
free, prior and informed consent, redress and a variety of
self-government, autonomy and other such arrangements. [States are **not
going to implement** this multifaceted and complex set of changes **on
their own**]{.underline}, however. [They will require **significant
political** and **moral pressure to hold them accountable** to the
**rhetorical commitments** they have made to support this level of
change. They will also require **ongoing conversation** and
**negotiation** with Indigenous peoples along the way, lest the process
becomes **problematically one-sided**. Such processes ultimately require
**sustained political will**, **commitment** and **engagement** over the
**long term**, to reach]{.underline} the end result of [**radical
systemic change** and Indigenous state relationships grounded in
**mutual respect**, **co-existence** and **reciprocity**. This type of
fundamental change requires **creative thinking**, **careful
diplomacy**, **tenacity**, and]{.underline} above all, [**optimistic
vision**, on the part of Indigenous peoples]{.underline}. The
**[pessimistic approaches]{.underline}** of the resurgence school
[are]{.underline} ultimately [of **little use**]{.underline} in these
efforts, [other than as a **cautionary tale** against state power, of
which the organisational players are **already keenly
aware**]{.underline}. Further, by [**dismissing** and **discouraging all
efforts at engagement** with states, and]{.underline} especially with
[the **blanket accusations** that all who engage in such efforts are
'**co-opted**' and not '**authentically**' Indigenous]{.underline}, the
resurgence school [actually creates **unnecessary negative feelings**
and **divisions** amongst Indigenous movements who should be **pooling
limited resources** and **working together towards better
futures**]{.underline}.

### Link---Theorizing

**Theory doesn't alter material conditions of violence.**

**Zack, 17**---Professor of Philosophy, University of Oregon (Naomi,
"Ideal, Nonideal, and Empirical Theories of Social Justice: The Need for
Applicative Justice in Addressing Injustice," The Oxford Handbook of
Philosophy and Race, Oxford University Press, February 2017, dml)
\[language modifications denoted by brackets\]

**[Ideals]{.underline}** of justice [may do **little** toward the
correction of injustice in **real life**]{.underline}. The influence of
John Rawls's A Theory of Justice has led some philosophers of race to
focus on "nonideal theory" as a way to bring conditions in unjust
societies closer to conditions of justice described by ideal theory.
However, [a **more direct approach**]{.underline} to injustice [may be
needed to address **unfair public policy** and **existing
conditions**]{.underline} for minorities in racist societies.
Applicative justice describes the applications of principles of justice
that are now "good enough" for whites to nonwhites (based on prior
comparisons of how whites and nonwhites are treated).

Social information just dribbles in, bit by bit, and we simply get used
to it. A single story about a person really hits home at once, but the
grinding injustices of daily life are endured. It is easy to ignore them
and we do.

Judith Shklar, The Faces of Injustice (Shklar 1990, 110)

IDEAL theory about justice extends from Plato's Republic to John Rawls's
A Theory of Justice, including many careers devoted to analyses and
criticism about such texts in political philosophy. Rawls offers a
picture of the basic institutional structures of a just society, on the
premise that in order to correct injustice, we must first know what
justice is. According to Rawls, while "partial compliance theory"
studies the principles that govern how we are to deal with injustice,
full compliance theory, or ideal theory, studies the institutional
principles of justice in a stable society where citizens obey the law.
Rawls began A Theory of Justice with the claim: "The reason for
beginning with ideal theory is that it provides, I believe, the only
basis for the systematic grasp of these more pressing problems" (Rawls
1971, 8).

Rawls's ideal [[theory is **too abstract** to **correct**
injustice]{.mark} or **provide** justice for victims of injustice [in
**reality**]{.mark}]{.underline}, because it is based on a thought
experiment and the assumption of a "well-ordered" society in which there
already is compliance with law (Zack 2016, 1--64). [What [people **care
about**]{.mark} in reality]{.underline} concerning justice [is [**not**
what ideal justice **is**]{.mark} or **would be**]{.underline}, [[but
**how** immediate injustice can be **corrected**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Injustice is **always specific** in **concrete events**]{.underline}
that are recognizable as certain types, for example, theft, murder, or
police racial profiling. Injustice can be corrected by punishing those
responsible for it in specific cases and instituting social changes that
prevent or reduce future occurrences of the same type.

Rawlsian nonideal theories of justice, constructed for societies where
people do not comply with just laws, rely on ideal theory as a standard
for just institutional structures. The main question driving nonideal
theory is how to construct a model or picture of justice that will
result in the future correction or avoidance of present injustices. John
Simmons quotes John Rawls from Law of Peoples, on this matter.

Nonideal theory asks how this long-term goal might be achieved, or
worked toward, usually in gradual steps. It looks for courses of action
that are morally permissible and politically possible as well as likely
to be effective \[LOP p. 89\].

(Simmons 2010, 7)

However, injured or indignant parties may not care about the long-term
goal of justice that could lead to balance or compensation for their
situations. Not only are what P. F. Strawson (1962) called "reactive
attitudes," such as moral indignation, blame, and a desire for deserved
punishment, strong in their focus on injustice, but [the **best
theory**]{.underline} of justice [in the **world** **does not tell us
what to do** about the injustices we are faced with in the **here** and
**now**]{.underline}, especially "the more pressing problems" of
race-related injustices. [Such [questions **cannot** be answered
with]{.mark} reference to]{.underline} ideal [**theory** or some
[**application** of]{.mark}]{.underline} ideal or nonideal [[theory
to]{.mark} their **[concrete situations]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [because
the **a priori nature**]{.underline} of both of these [does not provide
a fit with **specific contingencies**]{.underline}---ideal and nonideal
[theories do not generate **practical bridge principles**]{.underline}.
As [[theories]{.underline}]{.mark}, they posit ideal entities, but
without the apparatus of scientific theories which provides connections
to observable entities or events. (Moulines 1985). The correction of
injustice or injustice theory requires a philosophical foundation for
itself.

Models of justice have often been naïvely utopian throughout the history
of philosophy, because they [[are based on an assumption of]{.mark}
**automatic total [compliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[as though **the
right words**]{.underline}]{.mark} or pictures [by **themselves** have
the power to **[transform reality]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[or]{.mark}
as though **[agreement]{.mark}** with those right words]{.underline} or
pictures [will [**automatically result** in action that]{.mark} will
**automatically [make]{.mark}** [the world **instantiate** those]{.mark}
words]{.underline} or pictures. When they are not fantastically and
ineffectively utopian in this way, such models have been used to justify
the already-existing dominance of some groups over others. (A prime
example is John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, written decades
before 1688 Glorious Revolution, to express the interests of the new
rising class of landed gentry, which were eventually fulfilled by a
Protestant king on the throne and a strong representative parliament
after that revolution \[Laslett 1988\].)

Models of justice have legitimately served to inspire law in modern
societies with government constitutions and national and local law. But,
sometimes, as in US founding documents, although universal and absolute
justice is proclaimed, subsequent events make it clear that this
language was intended to legitimize just treatment for members of
selected groups only, that is, white male property owners, at first. [As
a result of **just [law]{.mark}** [and its **selective
application**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[over time]{.underline}**, [there
comes to be justice for an expanding group]{.underline}, [but still not
everyone]{.underline} in society. [However]{.underline}, [what is
**written**]{.underline}, together with descriptions of real justice for
some, [[can be a **powerful lever** for **obtaining justice** for **at
least some**]{.mark} of the excluded]{.underline}. To understand how
that works, [it is **necessary** to]{.underline} develop an approach to
justice that **[begin]{.underline}**s [with **injustice**]{.underline},
[in **real situations**]{.underline} where there is already some degree
of justice in a larger whole. The extension of existing practices of
justice to members of new groups is applicative justice, a concept with
substantial historical and intellectual precedent, although not by that
name. In what follows, more will be said about the idea of applicative
justice and then its history will be considered. Voting rights and
housing rights are examples of candidates for applicative justice in our
time. Finally, content in the form of narrative may be motivational for
social change.

The Idea of Applicative Justice

Applicative justice is an approach to justice with the goal of making
the unjust treatment of some comparable to those who already receive
just treatment. Applicative justice takes a comparative approach, for
example, comparing how young black males are treated by police officers
in contemporary US society, to how young white males are treated (Jones
2013; Zack 2013, 2015). Applicative justice rests on a pragmatic
approach to social ills, which includes the premise, based on Arthur
Bentley's 1908 insights in The Process of Government, that government is
much more than the apparatus of state and written laws and court
decisions. Government is an extended, dynamic process, an ongoing
contention among interest groups in society. This full-bodied, empirical
and pragmatic view of government process entails, for example, that we
consider as parts of the same political mix/phenomenon/raw material all
of the foregoing: the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, the 1960s Civil
Rights Legislation, doctrines of probable cause, the disproportionate
incarceration of African Americans, racial profiling, and police
homicide with impunity. Thus, Rawls's insistence that "the rights
secured by justice are not subject to political bargaining or to the
calculus of social interests" (Rawls 1971, 4), should be understood as
"the rights secured by justice should not be subject to political
bargaining or to the calculus of social interests." In reality, "the
rights secured by justice" are constantly subject to political
bargaining and the living calculus of social interests. One consequence
of this empirical perspective is that [moral **outrage**]{.underline},
[**critiques** of white supremacy]{.underline}, [or **analyses** of
white privilege]{.underline}, along with other forms of blame,
[**[cannot]{.mark}** be assumed to have the power to **[change]{.mark}
anything**]{.underline}, **[[by themselves]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By
contrast, [changing **relationships**]{.underline} between police
officers and their local communities, [or changing the **rules of
engagement**]{.underline} when police stop or attempt to stop suspects,
[might]{.underline} on this view [have some **causal
power**]{.underline} (Ayres and Markovits 2014). It is important to
realize that such changes in practice would not be specific applications
of a theory of justice, but ways of changing social reality into a
different political mix.

However, a better theory of justice, even a more racially egalitarian
one and even a theory of applicative justice that was widely accepted,
would still be no more than a change in what Bentley calls "political
content." Any theory of justice or any set of just laws is compatible
with widespread racially unequal and unjust practice. And the converse
also holds. Unjust laws or laws with gaps for unjust practice are
compatible with just practice. Thus, applicative justice is pragmatic in
taking the whole political mix/ phenomenon/raw material as its subject
for a specific injustice. Unlike ideal or nonideal justice theory, the
applicative justice approach brooks little faith that reality can be
changed by a special conceptual space or mode of critical moral
discourse that is undertaken apart from reality. [[Reality **cannot be
changed** by **normative pronouncements**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [by or
on behalf of the oppressed]{.underline}, [[but **only** by **shifts in
existing interests** of **groups of real people**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[To base hopes]{.mark} for change [on normative content
**alone**]{.mark} may]{.underline} paralyze
\[**[[eliminate]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] [the **means** for taking
[action]{.mark} that **could result in change**]{.underline}, [because
such content proceeds as though matters of justice were **only matters
of argument**]{.underline}. [[Those who have **opposed**]{.mark} social
racial [justice]{.mark} have **[understood this]{.mark} well
enough**]{.underline}, [because [instead of]{.mark} **mainly
[arguing]{.mark}** against new just law]{.underline} over the twentieth
century, [[they have **taken action**]{.mark} to block
progress]{.underline}.

### Link---Undercommons/Hapticality/Fugitivity

#### The alt can't solve their links. \[[Fugitivity/undercommons/maroonage]{.mark}\] is affectively appealing but [fizzles out]{.underline} when actualized in the university. 

**Webb, 18**---Senior Lecturer in Education at the University of
Sheffield (Darren, "Bolt-holes and breathing spaces in the system: On
forms of academic resistance (or, can the university be a site of
utopian possibility?)," Review of Education, Pedagogy, and Cultural
Studies, 40:2, 96-118, dml)

[[It is **easy to be seduced** by the]{.mark} language of the
[undercommons]{.mark}. **[Embodying]{.mark}** and **enacting
[it]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} however, [is **difficult**]{.mark} **indeed**.
[Being within and against the university]{.mark}, refusing the call to
order through insolent obstructive unprofessionalism, [is]{.mark}
**almost [impossible to sustain]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Halberstam (2009, 45) describes the undercommons as "a marooned
community of outcast thinkers who refuse, resist, and renege on the
demands of rigor, excellence, and productivity." [[A
**romantic**]{.mark} and **appealing [notion]{.mark} for sure** [but
refusing]{.mark} and reneging on "the university of [excellence" will
**cost you your job**]{.mark}]{.underline}. When Moten describes
subversion as a "series of immanent upheavals" expressed through "vast
repertoires of high-frequency complaints, imperceptible frowns,
withering turns, silent sidesteps, and ever-vigilant attempts not to see
and hear" (2008, 1743), one is reminded instantly of Thomas Docherty,
disciplined and suspended for his negative vibes.7 Being with and for
the maroon community is difficult too. First of all, ["Where and how can
we find/see the Undercommons at work?"]{.underline} (Ĉiĉigoj,
Apostolou-Hölscher, and Rusham 2015, 265). [Where and how can one find
those liminal spaces of sabotage and subversion, and how does one occupy
them]{.underline} in a spirit of hapticality, study, and militant
arrhythmia that brings the utopic underground to the surface of the
fierce and urgent now? [Beautiful language, but **[how does one live
it]{.mark}**? Networks do, of course, exist]{.underline}---the
Undercommoning Collective, the Edu-Factory Collective, the International
Network for Alternative Academia, to name but a few. [These are
promising spaces for bringing together and harboring the maroons and the
fugitives. But [networks are]{.mark} **typically [short-lived]{.mark}**,
and]{.underline}---as Harney and Moten warned---[there is a danger of
**institutionalization**, of **taking institutional practices with you**
into alternative spaces "because we've **been inside so
much**"]{.underline} (Harney and Moten 2013, 148). [And so,
**predictably**, [meetings]{.mark} of the fugitives come [with
**structure**, **order**]{.mark}]{.underline}, an official agenda, and
circulated minutes. The outcasts convene in conventional academic
conferences, with parallel sessions, panels of papers, lunch breaks,
wine and nibbles (e.g., Edu-Factory 2012). [These spaces [offer **time
out**]{.mark}, **welcome respite**]{.underline}, a breathing space, a
trip abroad, [[and then one **returns to work**]{.underline}.]{.mark}
[If **[hapticality]{.mark}**, the touch of the undercommons, is "a
**visceral register of experience**]{.underline} ... the feel that what
is to come is here" (Bradley 2014, 129--130), [then this [seems
**elusive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is hard to detect a sense of the
utopic undercommons rising to the surface of the corporate-imperial
university. [Moten describes the call to disorder and to study as a way
to "excavate new aesthetic, political, and economic
dispositions"]{.underline} (Moten 2008, 1745). [But this notion of
excavating is **highly problematic**. It is common within the discourse
of "everyday utopianism"]{.underline}---finding utopia in the everyday,
recovering lost or repressed transcendence in "everydayness" (Gardiner
2006)---[to describe the process of utopian recovery in terms of
**excavating**: excavating repressed desires, submerged longings,
suppressed histories, untapped possibilities. But [the **fundamental
questions of where to dig** and **how to identify** a utopian "find" are
**never adequately addressed**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Webb 2017).
[Gardiner defines utopia as "a series of forces, tendencies and
possibilities that are immanent in the here and now, in the pragmatic
activities of everyday life"]{.underline} (2006, 2). [But how are these
forces, tendencies and possibilities to be **identified** and
**recovered**?]{.underline} [For Harney and Moten, it is through
**[study]{.mark}**, **[hapticality]{.mark}** and **militant
arrhythmia**. These [are **slippy concepts**]{.mark}, however,
**[evading concrete material referents]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
What is it to inhabit the undercommons? Those who have written of their
experiences refer to "small acts of marronage" such as poaching
resources and redeploying them in ways at odds with the university's
designs and demands (Reddy 2016, 7), or exploiting funding streams "to
form cracks in the institution that enable the Others to invade the
university" (Smith, Dyke, and Hermes 2013, 150). For Adusei-Poku (2015),
the undercommons is a space of refuge which is all about survival (2015,
4--5). We who feel homeless in the university are forced into refuge. We
gather together to survive. [We may **gain satisfaction from small acts
of marronage**, but this is less about bringing the utopic common
underground to the surface as it is a form of "**radical
escapism**"]{.underline} (Adusei-Poku 2015, 4). Benveniste (2015, v)
tells us that: "The undercommons has no set location and no return
address. There is no map for entering and no guide for staying. The only
condition is a living appetite. Listen to its hunger for difference."
[[We need **more than poetry**]{.underline}]{.mark}, however. [And we
need more than a series of minor acts of resistance]{.underline}. As
Srnicek and Williams rightly emphasize, [resistance is a **defensive**,
**reactive gesture**, **resisting against**. Resistance is **not a
utopian endeavour**: "[We **do not resist a new world into
being**"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Srnicek and Williams 2016, 47). [The
undercommons, when one can find it, is a **bolt hole**, a **place of
refuge**, a **breathing space** in the system. We need **something
more**.]{.underline} The occupation Can the occupied building operate as
a site of utopian possibility within the corporate-imperial university?
Reflections on, and theorizations of, two recent waves of
occupation---"Occupied California" 2009--2010 and the UK Occupations
2010--2011---have answered this question affirmatively. The "occupation"
should not be understood here as solely or necessarily "student
occupation." It goes without saying---though sadly so often does need
saying ---that "faculty also have a responsibility to fight with and for
students" (Smeltzer and Hearn 2015, 356). Though led by a new historical
subject, "the graduate without a future" (Schwarz-WeinStein 2015, 11),
the importance of faculty support for the occupations was emphasized on
both sides of the Atlantic (Research and Destroy 2010, 11; Dawson 2011,
112; Holmes and R&D and Dead Labour 2011, 14; Ismail 2011, 128; Newfield
and EduFactory 2011, 26). Long before Occupy took shape in Zuccotti
Park, "occupation" was being heralded as the harbinger of a new society
and a new way of being. If we return to the notion of creating utopian
spaces, the key aim for some of the occupiers was to create communes
within the university walls---to communize space (Inoperative Committee
2011, 6).8 Communization here is understood as a form of insurrectionary
anarchism that refuses to talk of a transition to communism, insisting
instead upon the immediate formation of zones of activity removed from
exchange, money, compulsory labor, and the impersonal domination of the
commodity form (Anon 2010a, 5). As one pamphlet declared: We will take
whatever measures are necessary both to destroy this world as quickly as
possible and to create, here and now, the world we want: a world without
wages, without bosses, without borders, without states. (Anon 2010d, 34)
This is a revolutionary anarchism that takes the university campus as
the site for a practice---communization---that not only prefigures but
also realizes the vision of a free society. Heavily influenced by The
Coming Insurrection (Invisible Committee 2009), but tapping into a long
tradition of anarchist theory and practice from Hakim Bey's Temporary
Autonomous Zones (Bey 1985) to David Graeber's Direct Action (Graeber
2009), occupation becomes "the creation of a momentary opening in
capitalist time and space, a rearrangement that sketches the contours of
a new society" (Research and Destroy 2010, 11). It is "an attempt to
imagine a new kind of everyday life" (Hatherley 2011, 123). Firth (2012)
refers to these momentary openings as critical, experimental utopias:
Such utopias are ... simultaneously immanent and prefigurative. They are
immanent insofar as they allow space for the immediate expression of
desires, satisfaction of needs and also the articulation of difference
or dissent. They are prefigurative to the extent that they allow one to
practice and exemplify what one would like to see at a more
proliferative range in the future (26) The ultimate aim is for the
practice to spread beyond the campus through a dual process of
provocative rupture---the idea that insurrectionary moments can unleash
the collective imagination and stimulate an outpouring of creativity
that blows apart common sense and offers glimpses of a future world
(Gibson-Graham 2006, 51; Shukaitis and Graeber 2007, 37)---and
"contaminationism," that is, spreading by means of example (Graeber
2009, 211). It may well have been the case that communism was realized
on the campuses of Berkeley and UCL, that a momentary opening in
capitalist space/time appeared through which another world could be
glimpsed. The occupation, however---whether California, London, or
anywhere else---is likely always to remain a localized temporary
disruptive practice. A practice with utopian potency, for sure, in terms
of suspending normalized forms of discipline and opening new egalitarian
discursive spaces (Rheingans and Hollands 2013; Nişancioğlu and Pal
2016). In terms of wider systemic change, however, "small interventions
consisting of relatively non-scalable actions are highly unlikely to
ever be able to reorganise our socioeconomic system" (Srnicek and
Williams 2016, 29). What "the occupation" demonstrates more than
anything is the reality of the corporate-imperial university, as the
institutional hierarchy, backed by the carceral power of the police and
criminal justice system, inevitably disperses the occupiers---often
using militarized force---and repossesses the occupied space in a strong
assertion of its ownership rights not only to university buildings but
also to what constitutes legitimate thought and behavior within them (on
this see Docherty 2015, 90). The significance, and utopian potential,
one attaches to campus occupations depends in part upon the significance
one attaches to the university as a site of struggle. For the
Edu-Factory Collective: As was the factory, so now is the university.
Where once the factory was a paradigmatic site of struggle between
workers and capitalists, so now the university is a key space of
conflict, where the ownership of knowledge, the reproduction of the
labour force, and the creation of social and cultural stratifications
are all at stake. This is to say the university is not just another
institution subject to sovereign and governmental controls, but a
crucial site in which wider social struggles are won and lost.
(Caffentzis and Federici 2011, 26) Clearly, if this is true, then the
form the struggle takes, and the example it sets, is of immense
significance. Srnicek and Williams describe as "wishful thinking" the
idea that the occupation might spread beyond the campus by means of
rupture or contamination (2016, 35). However, if the university really
is a key site of class struggle (Seybold 2008, 120; Haiven and
Khasnabish 2014, 38), a site through which wider struggles are refracted
and won or lost, then the transformative potential of the occupation
needs to be attended to seriously. The analysis of the university
offered by the Edu-Factory Collective is, however, outdated. Sounding
like Daniel Bell writing in 1973 about how universities had become the
"axial structures" of post-industrial society (Bell 1973, 12), the
analysis does not hold water today. Moten overdoes it when he tells us
that "the university is a kind of corpse. It is dead. It's a dead
institutional body" (Moten 2015, 78). What is clear, however, is that
"focusing on the university as a site of radical transformation is a
mistake" (Holmes and R&D and Dead Labour 2011, 13). As has been widely
noted, there is very little distinguishing universities from other
for-profit corporations (Readings 1996; Lustig 2005; Washburn 2005;
Shear 2008, Tuchman 2009). What does separate them is their
inefficiency, due in large part to the fact that universities operate
also as medieval guilds, with faculties "ruled by masters who lord over
journeymen and apprentices in an artisanal system of production"
(Jemielniak and Greenwood 2015, 77). If the university is a sinister
hybrid monstrosity---part medieval guild, part criminal
corporation---which has no role other than reproducing its own
privilege, then no special status can be attributed to campus protests.
In this case, "A free university in the midst of a capitalist society is
like a reading room in a prison" (Research and Destroy 2010, 10). A
reading room in a prison. Another apposite metaphor. The occupation is a
safe space, offering temporary respite, a place to hide, a refuge, a
bolt-hole, a breathing space. As with the utopian classroom and the
undercommons, what the occupation suggests is that "defending small
bunkers of autonomy against the onslaught of capitalism is the best that
can be hoped for" (Srnicek and Williams 2016, 48). Conclusion Zaslove
was right to characterize utopian pedagogy within the corporateimperial
university as the search for bolt-holes and breathing spaces in the
system. He himself suggests that, "All university classes should become
dialogic-experiential models that educate by expanding the zones of
contact with wider communities" (2007, 102). Like so many others,
Zaslove sees dialogic-experiential models of education beginning in the
classroom then expanding outward. The literature is full of references
to "exceeding the limits of the university classroom" (Coté, Day, and de
Peuter 2007a, 325), "extend \[ing\] beyond the boundaries of the campus"
(Ruben 2000, 211), and "breeching the walls of the university compounds
and spilling into the streets" (Research and Destroy 2010, 10). This all
brings to mind Giroux's notion of academics as border crossers (Giroux
1992), but it also paints a picture of academics taking as their
starting point the university and from there crossing the border into
the community and the street. [[The University]{.mark} can be the site
for **fleeting**, **transitory**, **small-scale experiences** of utopian
possibility]{.underline}---in the classroom, the undercommons, the
occupation. [It [**cannot be the site for transformative utopian
politics**. It **cannot even be the starting point for
this**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Given the corporatization and
militarization of the university, academics are increasingly becoming
"functionaries of elite interests" inhabiting a culture which serves to
reproduce these interests (Shear 2008, 56). [[Within the
university]{.mark}, "radical" initiatives or [movements will **soon be
co**]{.mark}**-[opted]{.mark}**, **recuperated**, **commodified**, [and
**neutralized**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gibson-Graham 2006, xxvi; Seybold
2008, 123; Neary 2012b, 249; Rolfe 2013, 21). [[Institutional habitus
**weights so heavily** that projects]{.mark} born in the university
[will be **scarred from the outset** by]{.mark} a certain [colonizing
"**imaginary of education**]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Burdick and Sandlin
2010, 117). [And]{.underline} we have long known that [[the university
is **but one space of learning**]{.mark}, and perhaps **not a very
important one** at that. Identifying the academy as the **starting
point** for a utopian pedagogy **privileges this arcane space** over
sites of **public pedagogy**]{.underline} such as film, television,
literature, sport, advertising, architecture, media in its various
forms, political organizations, religious institutions, and the
workplace (Todd 1997). Perhaps [the emphasis on **[creating radical
experimental spaces]{.mark}** within the academy [needs to **shift**
toward operating in]{.mark} **existing spaces of resistance [outside
it]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Haiven and Khasnabish argue that [many social
[movements **function**]{.mark} **already** [as]{.mark} "**social
[lab]{.mark}oratorie[s]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the generation of
**[alternative relationships]{.mark}**, **subjectivities**,
**institutions** and **practices**"]{.underline} (2014, 62), [providing
"a **space for experiments** in]{.underline} knowledge production,
**[radical imagination]{.underline}**, subjectification, [and **concrete
alternative-building**"]{.underline} (Khasnabish 2012, 237). Why locate
utopian pedagogy in the university when "critical utopian politics" can
take place in "infrastructures of resistance" such as intentional
communities, housing collectives, squats, art centers, community
theatres, bars, book shops, health collectives, social centers,
independent media and, increasingly of course, the digital sphere (Firth
2012; Shantz 2012; Amsler 2015; Dallyn, Marinetto, and Cederstrom 2015)?
[[Moving **beyond**]{.mark} **short-term**, **localized**,
**[temporary]{.mark} modes** of [resistance]{.mark}, [utopian pedagogy
would]{.mark} **work across these sites** [to develop a
**long-term**]{.mark} **strategy** and **[vision]{.mark}**. There is a
**role for the academic** in utopian politics, but **not in the
university-as-such**. [The utopian pedagogue has a
**responsibility**]{.mark} to]{.underline} exploit their own privilege
and to [work with]{.underline} students, communities and [movements
**outside** and **divorced from the university**]{.underline}. As Shear
rightly notes, academics (and especially those working in the humanities
and social sciences) "inhabit a privileged space in which [critical
inquiry]{.underline} concerning social hegemony and political-economic
domination" [is **possible**]{.underline} (Shear 2008, 56). [Within the
university, however, spaces for **embodying** and **enacting** this kind
of inquiry have become **constrained**, **compromised**, **monitored**,
**surveilled**, **co-opted**, and **recuperated**]{.underline}. As I
have argued throughout this article, [utopian pedagogy has become a
**search for bolt-holes** and **breathing spaces** in the system.
**[Beyond the academy]{.mark}**, however, there is a **role to
play**]{.underline}. As Chomsky (2010) tells us, [with privilege comes
responsibility]{.underline}. And as Giroux frames it, [this is an
**ethical** and **political responsibility** [to provide
"**theoretical**]{.mark} **resources** and **modes of
[analysis]{.mark}**[" to help forge "a **utopian
imaginary**]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Giroux 2014a; 153; 2014b, 200). [This
[means **putting**]{.mark} **one's [knowledge]{.mark}** [and **resources

together disparate inchoate dreams and yearnings in order [[to

### Link---Wynter

#### The aff is [naïve decolonization]{.underline} that prematurely discards [valuable tools]{.underline} for emancipation at the [first whiff]{.underline} of colonial association.

**Meagher, 18**---University of Connecticut (Thomas, "Maturity in a
Human World: A Philosophical Study,"
<https://opencommons.uconn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8155&context=dissertations>,
dml)

Of course, [these reflections take as their point of
departure]{.underline} not a universal and ahistoric form of patriarchy,
misogyny, or sexism, but rather [a **historically particular form**
instantiated through **Euro-modern colonialism**]{.underline} (Wynter,
1990; Oyèwùmí, 1997; Lugones 2007). What is it at issue is not so much
the intersection of standalone forms of racism and sexism, but rather
their mutual co-constitution through an imperial and colonial matrix of
power. [Following]{.underline} Sylvia **[Wynter]{.underline}**, we may
then raise the issue that [the problem]{.underline} of maturity [may be
linked to]{.underline} what she terms "[the **over-representation of
Man** as if it were the human]{.underline}" (2003). "Man" takes as its
point of reference a white, European or Euro-American bourgeois male, a
"global breadwinner" whose economic mastery is attributable not to
illegitimate regimes of appropriation and exploitation but rather to
Man's intrinsic virtue. [The modern episteme, Wynter contends, is
premised on **elevating Man** to the status of an **a priori ideal** of
humanity. A consequence is that modern forms of knowledge are shrouded
in a logic of "**biodicy**"]{.underline} (Wynter, 2006), in which
whatever ills humanity confronts can be attributed not to the misdeeds
of Man but rather to the intrinsic lack of value to be found in those
human beings who are not Man -- women, people of color, the global poor,
etc. As such, the imperative lurking behind Euro-modern conceptions of
maturity, as well as their enshrinement and naturalization within
Euro-modern institutions, may be not only "be a man" but simply "be
Man."

"Man," of course, stands ambiguously at the heart of many modern
discourses. On the one hand, "man" can be taken to refer explicitly and
particularly to adult males. On the other hand, "man" and "mankind" are
taken to refer to humanity in general, with similarly gendered pronouns
and suffixes serving as generic referents. Feminist thought has long had
to reckon with the ripe conditions for equivocation that this engenders,
and Wynter and other thinkers confronting problems of racism and
coloniality have gone further in establishing that for Euromodernity,
"man" equivocates between references to all human beings and references
merely to European peoples (and perhaps the occasional "honorary
white").

Yet receiving much less attention is another central ambiguity: if "man"
has an equivocal relation to categories of race and gender, what of its
relation to age and adulthood? If Euromodern discourses on man
over-represent a racialized, gendered, classed subject as if it
represented humanity writ large, is there a similar error in
over-representing the adult as if it were all humanity? Clearly, it
would be an error to say, for instance, that human rights are rights by
virtue of one's having attained adulthood; the "rights of man" often
refer to rights that would appear to be the human rights of children as
well as adults. Indeed, there may be some human rights that are
distinctly owed to children -- consider, for instance, S. Matthew Liao's
argument that children have a right to be loved (Liao, 2015). Yet here
the issue of paternalism emerges, a source of recurring debates in
Euro-modern thought due to its imbrication in colonial and patriarchal
modes of power. If children have a right to have guardians, then the
debate rages as to whether the child-like should likewise have some form
of protectorate imposed upon them.

Here a critical response emerges: if paternalism functions as a Trojan
horse for colonization and patriarchy, then perhaps it simply ought to
be rejected wholesale. Hence, what if decolonizing values requires
discarding the notion of maturity altogether? In other words, maturity
is woven into the fabric Euro-modern values, and it is therefore a
medium for the propagation of coloniality. Where efforts to value
maturity are present, it seems, the valorization of "Man" and
devalorization of women, people of color, etc. lurks in the shadows. If
Wynter's call is for "the human after Man," then it might follow that
what is needed is the achievement of the human after maturity.

b\. The Problem of Naïve Decolonization

[The notion that **any values associated with colonialism** or
**coloniality** ought to be **discarded**]{.underline}, however, [is
**fraught with problems**]{.underline}. The apt metaphor here pertains
to the folly of throwing babies out with the bathwater. [Colonialism is
an effort to **instrumentalize** land, people, culture, values, and
knowledge; it **invariably makes use** of that which is valued **prior
to colonization**. This is not to say that colonialism does not
introduce new values of its own, but even where this is the case,
colonialism often seeks to impose these through **projects of
cooptation** that are established in reference to the values that
**precede them**]{.underline}. In brief, the issue is that [efforts to
value]{.underline} maturity [are **by no means original** or
**exclusive** to Euro-modernity and coloniality]{.underline}.

Consider here Ifeanyi Menkiti's contention (1984, 2004) that it is
typical of African conceptions of personhood that one must mature in
order to become a person. Full personhood is not a product of birth
alone but is rather achieved through the acts and influences that make
one meaningfully a member of a community. The claim, then, is not simply
that it is better to be mature than not, but rather that a type of
maturity is requisite to attain an ontological status of personhood:
"passage through time helps create not only a qualitative difference
between young and old, but also an ontologically significant one"
(Menkiti, 2004: 325). [The notion of]{.underline} maturity as bearing
[**normative significance** and even the notion of]{.underline} maturity
as constitutive of [the **difference** between those who are **fully
human** and those who are **not** are **not purely European** or
**colonial inventions**. This is not to say that Europe did
not]{.underline} re-invent notions of maturity or [bring to them a
significance that was **distinctly colonial** and **not indigenous** to
a pre-colonial context]{.underline}. Nor is it to claim that it was
African societies' normative attachment to forms of maturity that made
them more susceptible to efforts of European colonization. [The point is
simply that]{.underline} maturity refers, ultimately, to ideals about
which [many societies have had constructive ideas **prior to
colonization**, and the fact that there are **colonial
ideals**]{.underline} of maturity, [as well as **precolonial
conceptions**]{.underline} of maturity [that have been **colonized** and
**transformed** in the process, **does not imply** that]{.underline}
maturity [ought to be **discarded wholesale** on the grounds that it is
**no more than a colonial artifact**.]{.underline}

[The effort to **reject whatever is associated with colonizers** or
**epochs of colonization** can be termed "**naïve decolonization**." I
do not mean to suggest that decolonization is **itself naïve** but
rather that one can **distinguish** between forms of decolonization that
are **naïve** and forms that are **mature**. Naïve decolonization often
works according to the logic of **guilt by association**. Under this
framework, decolonization's **chief responsibility** becomes to
**repudiate whatever happens to be associated with the
colonizers**]{.underline}. The problem with such an approach is one that
Aimé Césaire raised in Discourse on Colonialism (2000): that [to
**oppose colonialism**, to maintain that it dehumanizes both colonized
and colonizer, **does not mean** that one can **go back to a
pre-colonial world**]{.underline}. Frantz Fanon, likewise, issued the
call to "Leave this Europe where they are never done talking of Man, yet
murder men everywhere they find them" (1963: 311), but this "leaving"
meant to refuse the claim that Europe was an adequate model, that its
"successes" made it worthy of imitation. "It is a question," Fanon
wrote, "of the Third World starting a new history of Man, a history
which will have regard to the sometimes prodigious theses which Europe
has put forward, but which will also not forget Europe's crimes, of
which the most horrible was committed in the heart of man, and consisted
of the pathological tearing apart of his functions and the crumbling
away of his unity" (1963: 315). In short, [the **imperative** to build a
world **no longer suffering** from colonial pathologies may **require**
that one **not discard all European thought** in much the way that
European intellectuals often claimed that **all non-European thought
could be discarded**. Naïve decolonization regards **repudiation of the
colonial as sufficient** for decolonization; mature decolonization
confronts a responsibility to **build a world** that is **genuinely
after colonialism**]{.underline}, a world, as Fanon called for, in which
tools would not possess human beings and enslavement would be brought to
a permanent end, and wherein it would be possible for human beings to
discover and love each other, wherever they may be (1967a: 231).

In that sense, [we may issue a **warning** that **Wynter's call** for
"the **human**, **after Man**" **may not mean**, as such, the **death of
Man**]{.underline}. The obvious points of reference here are Michel
Foucault's vision that man could be erased "like a face drawn in the
sand at the edge of the sea" (Foucault 1994: 387) and Friedrich
Nietzsche's "God is dead. ... And we have killed him" (Nietzsche 2001:
§125). [The **problem** with a call for Man's death is that the death of
Man is **not necessarily the end of Man's power**. That Man should have
hegemonic power in shaping the world]{.underline}, in organizing it in
such a fashion so that each of its part serves Man's ends, [is an acute
concern. But the death of Man **does not guarantee the diminishment** of
such power]{.underline}. Foucault had expressed a similar concern in
warning that [**having literally cut off the king's head does not ensure
that one will have done likewise** in the realm of political
theory]{.underline} (Foucault, 1978: 88-9); the question can remain,
though, as to whether even cutting off the king's head in political
theory would eradicate the king's power over how politics is thought
about. Here African ontologies suggest a relevant point of
consideration: the death of ancestors does not eradicate their power
with regard to present and future generations (Gyekye, 1995: 68--84;
Henry, 2000: 26--43; L.R. Gordon, 2006: 58--61).

[Wynter]{.underline}, in building off of and beyond Foucault's
framework, [discussed these matters in terms of "**transumptive
chains**" that **govern the shift** from one episteme and epoch of power
to another. The **symbols** and **modes of knowledge production** put
into effect to undergird one regime of power, do not "**resume**" so
much as "**transume**" -- that is, their **interruption by revolutions**
and **epistemic breaks** yields their continuation in **altered
forms**]{.underline}. The "death of God" at issue for Nietzsche and
others was less an issue of God's absence and more an issue of how God
had been replaced; could science, philosophy, or Man really serve the
knowledge- and world-orienting roles that God had? To ask of humanistic
institutions that they replace God is, in its own way, a continuation of
the power of God: it is to impose a demand that is exogenous to those
institutions and that may transcend their capacities quite drastically.
[The degodding of the Western episteme, Wynter contends, moved
it]{.underline} out of a Christocentric framework of knowledge
production [into a partially secularized episteme of **Man-1**, premised
on the centrality and ideality of "**homo politicus**," which in turn
was further degodded and begot **Man-2**, the episteme of "**homo
oeconomicus**"]{.underline} (Wynter, 2003, 2006). [But the **structure
of the argument** implies that present efforts toward decolonization
could, **simply**, **beget Man-3**, and simply because one takes as
one's aim that one will kill Man-2 **does not negate the possibility**
that one's efforts will **culminate in the hegemony of
Man-3**]{.underline}.

A further reference point of relevance, then, is Sigmund Freud's notion
of the Oedipus complex (Freud, 1977: 207--8, 328--38). Human beings
enter into a world in which they are cared for, but their maturation
facilitates the diminution of that care. Confrontation with an adult
world, though, may spark forms of resentment that engender an anxious or
oppositional relation to those by whom one has been nurtured. The notion
of the Oedipus complex suggests a desire to displace and replace those
sources of care, and the structure of such desire would be to persist
without reflective awareness: e.g., I want to spite my father by
surpassing him and reincarnate my mother's love through another, but I
may fail to understand that this desire is implicitly manifest in my
acts. The psychoanalyst, then, can point to the structural tendency of
human existence to produce Oedipal desires, and for the patient under
analysis, this can facilitate reflection on how one's behavior may
ultimately be the symbolic expression of the Oedipal. Fanon (1967a),
though, by taking this method seriously, saw that a rigid interpretation
of it would have to be transcended, for in a colonized society, the
sociogenesis of Oedipal structures would be quite different than it
would be in the European context that stimulated Freud's explorations.
If in both France and Martinique it was Man that was symbolically
produced as paragon of value, then the investment of Oedipal desire in
one's father could be typical among white children in France and
atypical among black children in Martinique. The tragic consequence is
that many black people would, in turn, act upon these desires
unreflectively, pursuing dreams of integration and white acceptance that
were simply unrealizable. Hence, the Oedipal could, in the colonial
context, be an extension of colonial power, part of the array of
psychological tools that undergird domination. A further problem, then,
is evident even in opposition to the colonizer: [pursuing the **death of
the colonizer**, to **passionately seek the death of Man**, could be to
**fail to confront** the causes of one's debilitation and]{.underline},
indeed, [to **exacerbate them**]{.underline}.

Psychoanalysis hinges on the importance of moving from a naïve
understanding of one's desires to a mature one. Ironically, this point
is often lost on many of those who repudiate Freudian psychoanalysis.
Indeed, both in positivist and post-structuralist psychologies there is
much evidence of an Oedipal relationship to Freud, an over-investment
in, as it were, cutting off his head in psychological theory. This may
take pathological expression where it means that one recapitulates the
worst of Freud's mistakes and discards his most prescient insights. An
example is illustrated by Emma Perez's criticism of Félix Guattari and
Gilles Deleuze's Anti-Oedipus. If Guattari and Deleuze are correct that
the Oedipal does not arise in the pre-colonial kinship structures of the
non-West, it does not thereby follow, Perez contends, that colonization
has not imposed the Oedipal on them. To resist the Oedipal diagnosis, in
short, does not combat the "Oedipalization" that coloniality puts into
place (Perez, 1999: 102--110). The "anti-" of antiOedipus may,
ultimately, betray an Oedipal anxiety at the heart of post-structuralist
efforts to hasten the death of their forbears. So, too, for positivist
approaches that, repelled by the limitations of the "talking cure"
approach of psychoanalysis, beget an uncritical and at times fetishistic
relationship to neurophysiological reductionism. That there are
limitations to the early articulations of psychoanalysis does not entail
that one ought to overlook its strengths, in the same way that the
psychoanalyst may recommend that the patient respond to the influence of
a flawed parent by at least attempting to grasp and understand the
parent's genuine virtues and accomplishments; otherwise, the disdain may
become pathological. The point of examining structures of Oedipal desire
is not to discover an inevitable fate -- to find that one is doomed to
pathology and catastrophe -- but rather to help one take responsibility
for reflecting upon what one really wants and needs and, to use Fanon's
term, to be actional in the face of powers one cannot fully eradicate.

What Fanon and Perez point to, then, is a model of mature decolonization
for which the mere acceptance and application of European ideas and
concepts is inadequate but for which the wholesale and uncritical
repudiation of those ideas and concepts is undesirable and
irresponsible. Hence, [the **maturity of decolonization** involves
**heeding**]{.underline} both Audre Lorde's warning that it would be
naïve to expect the master's tools to dismantle the master's house
(Lorde, 1984: 110--3) as well as [**Jane** and **Lewis Gordon's
warning** that the effort to dismantle the master's house is
**necessary** but **insufficient** for projects of
decolonization]{.underline} (Gordon and Gordon, 2006). [The master
is]{.underline}, indeed, [**well-versed** in how to **use his tools to
maintain his house**; for this reason, decolonization that **limits
itself to immanent critique**]{.underline} of the Euro-modern
intellectual canon [is likely doomed to **tilt at windmills**, for this
canon was by and large erected in order to **facilitate enduring modes**
of coloniality. But the diminution of the master's power is **not merely
a matter of dismantling his house**, and **tools** that the master has
sought to employ **might nonetheless be useful to construct other
houses**, to **create alternative possibilities** and
**futures**]{.underline}. In short, [naïve decolonization takes its
responsibilities as **delimited** by the need to **overthrow the
master**, but mature decolonization encounters an **expanded
responsibility** which demands the **creative** and **critical
apprehension** of the **resources** and **inventions** that can **build
a new world** and set afoot a **new humanity**]{.underline}. As such,
[it **needs to be wary** of naïve decolonization, for]{.underline},
among other issues, [naïve decolonization is a **tool** that masters
**can manipulate**, **have manipulated**, and may even at times
**appropriate as their own**. Think]{.underline}, for instance, [of the
many ways in which the ideal of a **color-blind society**, offered up
initially as an **anti-colonial idea**, has been turned into an
**asinine** but **effective tool** for passing and upholding policies
with **racist effects**, or the ways in which the expansion of U.S.
colonial power **drew upon exploitation** of the so-called "**Black
Legend**" to replace Spanish colonial power **without eradicating the
colonial standing** of the locales thus "liberated."]{.underline}

To speak of "naïve decolonization" at all, though, is to raise a thorny
linguistic issue, for "naïve" shares its etymological roots with the
term "native." The notion that its articulation in modern French and
English vernaculars is completely unrelated to conceptions of "natives"
in the colonies strains credulity. To decolonize the concepts that
shroud intellectual production and normative life requires critical
reflection on the relationship between the concepts as inherited and the
greater conceptual scheme of which they are parts. So, for instance, we
may speak of the efforts of those like Kwasi Wiredu (1997: 136--144) or
Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o (1986) toward decolonization by way of rethinking
concepts from the perspective of languages not imposed by colonizers
and, indeed, to be able to think enmeshed in these languages rather than
as a merely occasional visitor to them. But [it **does not follow** that
one is **in all cases better off** by having **abandoned terms** that
appear in the language of the colonizer, and the imperative of
crosscultural communication]{.underline} -- both in general and in the
particular case of projects of decolonization -- [may require being able
to **critically** and **reflectively employ language** that is neither
**purely innocent** nor **purely colonizing** in its **pragmatic
effects**]{.underline}. "Naïve" may simply refer to a cultural universal
with transcultural validity, whereas the peculiar sense of "native" in
Euro-modern languages may be the cultural particular of a cultural
formation guided by the telos of colonization.4 And where "naïve" is
used in such a way as to implicate this "native" baggage, [one **need
not throw one's hands up**]{.underline} and abandon the term, [since the
alternative of **distinguishing better** and **worse uses**]{.underline}

### Impact---Ressentiment 

**The impact is ressentiment and a dogmatically revolutionary telos
which can only devolve into a violent self-policing and pure
negativity---prefer our method of pluralist assemblages.**

Earth -- Deleuze, Guattari, and Anarchism," July 31, 2015,

Organisation is crucial, but [let us not forget that **for all their
differences** of **instantiation**, any group can **lapse into a mode of
organisation** that **repeats** the form of **the Party** and **hardens
into a new dogma** defined by **unquestioning loyalty**, **ascetism**
and the **crushing** or **recuperation of desire turned against
itself**]{.underline}. [We need "**new micropolitical** and
**microsocial practices**, new **solidarities**, a new **gentleness**,
together with **new aesthetic** and **new analytic
practices**.]{.underline}" [This is **not about creating agreement**,
because **the more we disagree** "the more **we create a field of
vitality**]{.underline}."

Again, [we **should be wary** of the **subjugated groups** and their
**repressed desires**, the **groupuscules** and their **channelling of
libidinal investments** into **hierarchies**, **reform** and
**inertia**]{.underline}. **[What is the viscosity and consistency of
our group forms?]{.underline}** How do we come together? What flows
between us? **[What are our fluid dynamics?]{.underline}** How quickly
do we congeal or dissipate?

[**Attentiveness to the new is crucial**: the world now is not the world
then and we are not who we were. The new fascism]{.underline} -- the
Urstaat awakened and given new strength by capitalism -- [produces **a
peace more terrifying than war** and if we are not careful then "**all
our petty fears will be organized in concert**, all **our petty
anxieties** will be **harnessed** to **make micro-fascists of us**; we
will be called upon to **stifle every little thing**, **every suspicious
face**, **every dissonant voice**, **in our streets**." This does not
mean that we cannot, however, also act **against our time** in favour of
**a time to come**]{.underline}.

[Engagements on the level of discourse are **important but limited**.
Control functions just as much through **machinic enslavement of the
body** -- **affects**, percepts, imaginations, desires, calories, flows
of water and electricity -- as it does through **the social subjection**
that produces, through the **signifying systems** that increasingly fill
every corner of the world, **alienation** and **ideological
hegemonies**. The new signifying systems also operate in **a double
movement**, whereby they **open up the flows of information** whilst
simultaneously **closing down collective enunciative
capacity.**]{.underline}

[**Ressentiment -- revenge, resentment and reaction -- impedes all
revolutionary becoming** and will **only lead to further oppression**,
of **each other** and of **ourselves**]{.underline}. [Do not **trust
those who spread ressentiment** and call for **the settling of
accounts**; they **seek only slaves** as allies and always reproduce
what they aim to destroy]{.underline}. "To have ressentiment or not to
have ressentiment -- there is no greater difference, beyond psychology,
beyond history, beyond metaphysics. It is the true difference or
transcendental typology -- the genealogical and hierarchical
difference."

**[This is especially true of identity politics]{.underline}**. [If we
remained **trapped in a Hegelian spirit** of **revenge** then our
**victories** will **always be written into the world as victories as
slaves**]{.underline}. [Identity, **even intersectional identity**,
reifies **molar categories** in its **production of axes** of
differentiation]{.underline}. [Instead of **categories that always
repeat the Same** through **false appeals** to **identity**,
**analogy**, **resemblance** and **opposition**, we would do better to
**think of our multiple** and **alway-shifting overlappings** as
**events** and **encounters**, not as perennial attributes of
interpellated subjects]{.underline}. **[If we're seeking to hold on to
established identities, then what are we resisting?]{.underline}** Our
own transformation through association with other bodies? Our capacity
to expand joy? [Is it not precisely the blockage of desiring-production
within sedimented identities that has resulted -- and continues to
result -- in relations of hierarchy and domination]{.underline}?
Besides, "the forces of repression need always an ascribable self and
specifiable individuals to apply. [When we **become a little liquid**,
when we **evade the ascription of the self**" then **perhaps we have a
chance**]{.underline}. [Let us then become liquid; let us fold and
unfold and refold in the practice of]{.underline} what Edouard Glissant
calls **['relation-identity']{.underline}**. [This way we can also begin
to **discover our "rigid segments,"** our **"binary and overcoding
machines,"** and that "we **are not simply divided up by binary
machines** of class, sex, or age" but that there are "others which we
**constantly shift \[and\] invent without realizing it**." Our true
names are not "pure" but instead "bastard, lower, anarchical, nomadic,
and irremediably minor]{.underline}."

At the same time, [struggle on the level of axioms is **not
unimportant**]{.underline}. [**The fight for reforms** -- for service
delivery, for jobs, for recognition, for a voice -- can **aid in
minority becomings**]{.underline}. However, [struggles on this level
**only facilitate such becomings** and **are not always
necessary**]{.underline}. [These molar politics are "the index of
**another coexistent combat**," a **micropolitics**]{.underline}. At the
very least, **[we must be done with the hegemony of
hegemony]{.underline}**. [Our "**revolutionary organization must be that
of the war machine**." We seek a **nomadic revolutionary science**, not
a **Royal science of teleologies** and **base-superstructures** and
**counter-hegemonies** and **determinations in the last instance**. We
are **multiple**, **heterogeneous**. There are **always an infinity of
peoples**.]{.underline}

### Impact---World-Target

#### The [only thing]{.underline} voting aff exports from debate is a [thoroughly militarized epistemology]{.underline} that can [only]{.underline} relate to Otherness as violence.

**Chow 6.** Rey Chow, Andrew W. Mellon professor of the humanities at
Brown, The Age of the World Target, pg. 38-41

In the decades since 1945, [whether in dealing with the Soviet
Union]{.underline}, the People\'s Republic of [China]{.underline}, North
[Korea]{.underline}, [Vietnam]{.underline}, and countries in [Central
America]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} during [the Gulf
Wars]{.underline}, [the United States has been conducting war on the
basis of a **certain kind of knowledge production**]{.underline}, and
[producing knowledge on the basis of **war**]{.underline}. War and
knowledge enable and foster each other primarily through the collective
fantasizing of some foreign or alien body that poses danger to the
\"self\" and the \"eye\" that is the nation. Once the monstrosity of
this foreign body is firmly established in the national consciousness,
the [decision makers]{.underline} of the U.S. government often [talk and
behave as though they had no choice but war]{.underline}.38 War, then,
is acted out as a moral obligation to expel an imagined dangerous
alienness from the United States\' self-concept as the global custodian
of freedom and democracy. Put in a different way, [the \"**moral
element**]{.underline},\" insofar as it produces knowledge about the
\"self\" and \"other\"---and hence the \"eye\" and its \"target\"---as
such, [justifies war by its very dichotomizing logic]{.underline}.
Conversely, the violence of war, once begun, fixes the other in its
attributed monstrosity and affirms the idealized image of the self. In
this regard, the pernicious stereotyping of the Japanese during the
Second World War---not only by U.S. military personnel but also by
social and behavioral scientists---was simply a flagrant example of an
ongoing ideological mechanism that had accompanied Western treatments of
non-Western \"others\" for centuries. In the hands of academics such as
Geoffrey Gorer, writes Dower, the notion that was collectively and
\"objectively\" formed about the Japanese was that they were \"a
clinically compulsive and probably collectively neurotic people, whose
lives were governed by ritual and \'situational ethics,\' wracked with
insecurity, and swollen with deep, dark currents of repressed resentment
and aggression.\"39 As Dower points out, such stereotyping was by no
means accidental or unprecedented: The Japanese, so \"unique\" in the
rhetoric of World War Two, were actually saddled with racial stereotypes
that Europeans and Americans had applied to nonwhites for centuries:
during the conquest of the New World, the slave trade, the Indian wars
in the United States, the agitation against Chinese immigrants in
America, the colonization of Asia and Africa, the U.S. conquest of the
Philippines at the turn of the century. These were stereotypes,
moreover, which had been strongly reinforced by nineteenth-century
Western science. In the final analysis, in fact, these favored idioms
denoting superiority and inferiority transcended race and represented
formulaic expressions of Self and Other in general.\"\' The moralistic
divide between \"self\" and \"other\" constitutes the production of
knowledge during the U.S. Occupation of Japan after the Second World War
as well. As Monica Braw writes, in the years immediately after 1945, the
risk that the United States would be regarded as barbaric and inhumane
was carefully monitored, in the main by cutting off Japan from the rest
of the world through the ban on travel, control of private mail, and
censorship of research, mass media information, and other kinds of
communication. [The entire Occupation policy was permeated by the view
that \"the United States was not to be accused; guilt was only for
Japan\"]{.underline}:41 As the Occupation of Japan started, the
atmosphere was military. Japan was a defeated enemy that must be
subdued. The Japanese should be taught their place in the world: as a
defeated nation, Japan had no status and was entitled to no respect.
People should be made to realize that any catastrophe that had befallen
them was of their own making. Until they had repented, they were
suspect. If they wanted to release information about the atomic bombings
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it could only be for the wrong rea-sons, such
as accusing the United States of inhumanity. Thus this informa-tion was
suppressed.42 As in the scenario of aerial bombing, the elitist and
aggressive panoramic \"vision\" in which the other is beheld means that
the sufferings of the other matter much less than the transcendent
aspirations of the self. And, despite being the products of a particular
culture\'s technological fanaticism, such transcendent aspirations are
typically expressed in the form of selfless uni-versalisms. As Sherry
puts it, \"[The reality of **Hiroshima** and **Nagasaki** seemed less
important than the bomb\'s effect on \'mankind\'s destiny,\' on
\'humanity\'s choice,\' on \'what is happening to men\'s
minds]{.underline},\' and [on hopes]{.underline} (now often
extravagantly revived) [to achieve world government]{.underline}.\"\'\"
On Ja-pan\'s side, as Yoneyama writes, such [a \"global narrative of the
universal history of humanity\" has helped sustain \"a **national
victimology** and **phantasm of innocence** throughout most of the
postwar years]{.underline}.\" Going one step further, she remarks: \"The
idea that Hiroshima\'s disaster ought to be remembered from the
transcendent and anonymous position of humanity .. . .might best be
described as \'nuclear universalism.\' \"44 Once the relations among
war, racism, and knowledge production are underlined in these terms, [it
is **no longer possible** to assume]{.underline}, as some still do,
[that the recognizable features of modern war]{.underline}---its
impersonality, coerciveness, and deliberate cruelty---[are
\"**divergences**\" from the \"**antipathy**\" to violence and to
conflict that characterize the modern world]{.underline}.45 Instead, it
would be incumbent on us to realize that the pursuit of war--- with its
use of violence---and the pursuit of peace---with its cultivation of
knowledge---are the obverse and reverse of the same coin, the coin that
I have been calling \"the age of the world target.\" Rather than being
irreconcilable opposites, [war and peace are
**coexisting**]{.underline}, collaborative functions in the continuum of
a virtualized world. More crucially still, only the privileged nations
of the world can afford to wage war and preach peace at one and the same
time. As Sherry writes, \"[The United States had **different resources**
with which to be fanatical]{.underline}: [resources allowing it to take
the lives of others more than its own, ones **whose accompanying
rhetoric of technique disguised the will to destroy**]{.underline}.\"45
 From this it follows that, if indeed political and military acts of
cruelty are not unique to the United States---a point which is easy
enough to substantiate---what is nonetheless remarkable is the manner in
which [such acts are]{.underline}, in the United States, usually
[cloaked in the form of **enlightenment** and **altruism**]{.underline},
[in]{.underline} the form of an [aspiration]{.underline} simultaneously
toward technological perfection [and the pursuit of peace]{.underline}.
In a country in which political leaders are held accountable for their
decisions by an electorate, violence simply cannot---as it can in
totalitarian countries---exist in the raw. [Even the **most violent
acts** must be adorned with a **benign**, **rational
story**]{.underline}. It is in the light of such interlocking relations
among war, racism, and knowledge production that I would make the
following comments about area studies, the academic establishment that
crystallizes the connection between the epistemic targeting of the world
and the \"humane\" practices of peacetime learning. From Atomic Bombs to
Area Studies As its name suggests, area studies as a mode of knowledge
production is, strictly speaking, military in its origins. Even though
the study of the history, languages, and literatures of, for instance,
\"Far Eastern\" cultures existed well before the Second World War (in
what Edward W. Said would term the old Orientalist tradition predicated
on philology), the systematization of such study under the rubric of
special geopolitical areas was largely a postwar and U.S. phenomenon. In
H. D. Harootunian\'s words, \"The systematic formation of area studies,
principally in major universities, was .. . a massive attempt to
relocate the enemy in the new configuration of the Cold War.\"47 As
Bruce Cumings puts it: \"It is now fair to say, based on the
declassified evidence, that the American state and especially the
intelligence elements in it shaped the entire field of postwar area
studies, with the clearest and most direct impact on those regions of
the world where communism was strongest: Russia, Central and Eastern
Europe, and East Asia.\"48 In the decades after 1945, when the United
States competed with the Soviet Union for the power to rule and/or
destroy the world, these regions were the ones that required continued,
specialized super-vision; to this list we may also add [Southeast Asia,
Latin America, and the Middle East]{.underline}. As areas to be studied,
these regions [took on the significance of target
fields]{.underline}---fields of information retrieval and dissemination
that were necessary for the perpetuation of the United States\'
political and ideological hegemony. In the final part of his classic
Orientalism, Said describes area studies as a continuation of the old
European Orientalism with a different pedagogical emphasis: [No longer
does an Orientalist try first to master the esoteric languages of the
Orient; he begins instead as a **trained social scientist** and
\"**applies**\" his science to the Orient, or anywhere
else.]{.underline} This is the specifically American contribution to the
history of Orientalism, and it can be dated roughly from the period
immediately following World War II, when the United States found itself
in the position recently vacated by Britain and France.\" Whereas Said
draws his examples mainly from Islamic and Middle Eastern area studies,
Cumings provides this portrait of the Fast Asian target field: The
Association for Asian Studies (AAS) was the first \"area\" organization
in the U.S., founded in 1943 as the Far Eastern Association and
reorganized as the AAS in 1956. Before 1945 there had been little
attention to and not much funding for such things; but now the idea was
to bring contemporary social science theory to bear on the non-Western
world, rather than continue to pursue the classic themes of Oriental
studies, often examined through philology. . In return for their
sufferance, [the Orientalists would get **vastly enhanced academic
resources**]{.underline} (positions, libraries, language
studies)---[and]{.underline} soon, [a certain degree of **separation**
which came from the social scientists inhabiting institutes of East
Asian studies, whereas the Orientalists occupied departments of East
Asian languages and cultures]{.underline}. This implicit Faustian
bargain sealed the postwar academic deal.50 A largely administrative
enterprise, [closely tied to policy, the new American Orientalism took
over from the old Orientalism attitudes of cultural hostility, among
which is]{.underline}, as Said writes, the dogma that \"the Orient is at
bottom something either to be feared (the Yellow Peril, the Mongol
hordes, the brown dominions) or to be controlled (by [**pacification**,
**research and development**, outright **occupation whenever
possible**]{.underline}).\"\" Often under the modest and apparently
innocuous agendas of fact gathering and documentation, [the
**\"scientific\" and \"objective\" production of knowledge** during
peacetime about the various special \"areas\" became the institutional
practice that substantiated and elaborated the **militaristic
con-ception of the world as target**]{.underline}.52 In other words,
[despite the claims about the apolitical and disinterested nature of the
pursuits of higher learning, activities undertaken under the rubric of
area studies, such as language training, historiography, anthropology,
economics, political science, and so forth, are **fully inscribed** in
the **politics and ideology of war.**]{.underline} To that extent, [the
disci-plining, research, and development of so-called academic
information are **part and parcel of a strategic logic**]{.underline}.
And yet, [if the production of knowledge (with its vocabulary of aims
and goals, research, data analysis, experimentation, and verification)
in fact shares the same scientific and military premises as
war]{.underline}---if, for instance, the ability to translate a
difficult language can be regarded as equivalent to the ability to break
military codes\"---is it a surprise that [it is **doomed to fail** in
its avowed **attempts to \"know\"** the other cultures]{.underline}? Can
\'knowledge\" that is derived from the same kinds of bases as war put an
end to the violence of warfare, or is such knowledge not simply
warfare\'s accomplice, destined to destroy rather than preserve the
forms of lives at which it aims its focus? [As long as knowledge is
**produced in this self-referential manner**, as a circuit of
**targeting** or getting the other that ultimately **consolidates** the
omnipotence and omnipresence of **the sovereign \"self\" /
\"eye\"**---the \"I\"--- that is the United States, the other will have
**no choice** but remain just that---**a target** whose existence
**justifies only one thing**, **its destruction by the
bomber**]{.underline}. As long as the focus of our study of Asia remains
the United States, and as long as this focus is not accompanied by
knowledge of what is happening elsewhere at other times as well as at
the present, [such study will ultimately confirm once again the
**self-referential function** of virtual worlding that was unleashed by
the dropping of the atomic bombs, with the United States **always
occupying the position of the bomber**, and other cultures **always
viewed as the military and information target fields**]{.underline}. In
this manner, events whose historicity does not fall into the
epistemically closed orbit of the atomic bomber---such as the Chinese
reactions to the war from a primarily anti-Japanese point of view that I
alluded to at the beginning of this chapter---will never receive the
attention that is due to them. \"[Knowledge]{.underline},\" however
conscientiously gathered and however large in volume, [will lead only to
further silence and to **the silencing of diverse
experiences**]{.underline}.54 This is one reason why, as Harootunian
remarks, area studies has been, since its inception, haunted by \"the
absence of a definable object\" ---and by \"the problem of the vanishing
object.\"55

### Link---Aesthetics

#### Aesthetic resistance becomes a new market for indie capitalism

**Kyratzes 13** (Jonas Kratzes, writer and filmmaker, "Rebellious
Aesthetics and Indie Capitalism", 12/18/13,
<http://www.jonas-kyratzes.net/2013/12/18/rebellious-aesthetics-and-indie-capitalism/>)
// EL

Boots Riley is not only one of my favourite contemporary musicians, he's
also an artist whose politics are radical in a way that seems to be
relatively rare in the United States. A while ago he wrote something (in
reference to outrage about Urban Outfitters selling a "Vintage Men's
Punk Leather Jacket") that I thought was really worth sharing and
discussing.

Punk and "Underground" Hip-Hop is simply indie capitalism. Indie
capitalism is not an answer to our problems, even if it didn't develop
into this. [A rebellious aesthetic is not an actual revolutionary
movement. An aesthetic is always absorbed and used by the class which is
in power. This is why we must have a radical movement that builds its
numbers for revolution by using mass direct action to make material
changes in the lives of those involved, while making it clear that we
are out to create a new system- showing the class structure of the
current system, while teaching through example that there is power in
numbers and that we can win]{.underline}.

Next up for urban outfitters: whatever revolutionary uniform we're
wearing right now.

This is quite possibly the most succinct phrasing of the problem I have
with so much recent "radical" art, whether it's punk music or indie
games: the belief that doing something aesthetically or socially unusual
is itself a revolutionary act. And I see why it's easy to make that
mistake: after all, there is definite resistance from the established
order! [Whether your art is pushing a previously-excluded social
identity or a new/rediscovered style or technique, the fact that you
have to fight people who quite clearly identify with the system makes
you feel like you're fighting the system itself. But you're not, and
that's the whole point of calling it a system -- its current
representatives are part of the machine as much as any worker is, and
are just as easily replaced.]{.underline} Their position in society may
be a manifestation of the inequality of the system, but they're not the
cause of the inequality -- only its face.

Capitalism consists of a set of social relations, not of a group of
capitalists. And the social relations of capitalism are all about
conflict; capitalism thrives on conflict, and in its eternal quest for
compound growth, capitalism loves nothing more than a new market. [In
fact, capitalism desperately needs ne]{.underline}w markets, because the
existing markets simply cannot provide enough growth to avoid crisis.
[But when the big, sluggish, corporate world can't innovate or
indoctrinate quickly enough to produce new markets, who can help? Why,
it's the young, flexible, passionate indie capitalist, who has always
felt excluded from the mainstream, who wants a new space, a new way of
making or selling art... a new market]{.underline}.

And the history of social oppression? Well, that's doubly fantastic. [It
means that the new target audience is hungry for art directed
exclusively at it, experiencing a kind of nationalistic pride at being
able to support artists that belong to the same identity group. And it
also means that the pent-up anger of this group can be safely dissipated
into "radical" art, the purchase and consumption of which gives the
emotionally and politically engaged audience the feeling that they're
doing something for the greater good, that progress towards equality is
being made. But all that's happening is that a new market is being
created, and indie capitalists are making money off of it]{.underline}.
These new capitalists may be different in some ways (skin colour,
clothing, sexuality, gender, aesthetic preferences, religious beliefs,
nationality, etc.) but the system itself hasn't changed in any way,
except that representatives of the old order can pat themselves on the
back for how "inclusive" and "forward-thinking" they are.

Then, given enough time, [the glamour of recently accomplished "change"
wears off, and it's time for another rebellious aesthetic to fight for
the right of a small group of people to make a living, never even
noticing that "the Man" used to be a rebellious artist
himself.]{.underline}

So what's a politically radical artist supposed to do? Starve?

Many radical artists seem to struggle with that question. They dislike
capitalism, so they feel bad about selling things -- but they also need
to pay the rent. Are they selling out? Are they hypocrites? Often the
only way out of this dilemma is to embrace the myth that indie
capitalism is somehow morally better than the regular kind, because the
money is going to an oppressed person. In this way, they often end up
perpetuating the narrative of the exceptional minority: look, this
person made it, they're one of us, they've struck a blow for our cause,
everything is getting better. This is even less productive than worrying
about your own hypocrisy.

The cause of this political and philosophical confusion in radical
artists is a very simple error in framing their own situation. If you
follow the logic of "the personal is the political" and understand
capitalism as a matter of lifestyle, a matter of identity, then the only
way to be morally pure is to "drop out" -- and given that pretty much
the entire world is capitalist at this point, that would mean abandoning
civilization itself. The moral anticapitalist will always see a sinner
in the mirror, and in every battle to destroy "the capitalists" will
manage only to, in the words of Todd Gitlin, "change the color of
inequality."

But understanding capitalism as a system, not a sin, easily solves this
problem. Everyone participates in capitalism, not just "the privileged"
-- capitalism defines and affects the totality of social relations, and
no-one is free from it. But no-one is morally responsible for it,
either. Rupert Murdoch may be a terrible human being and a blight upon
the face of the Earth, but he's far more a function of the system than
he is its owner. Obviously most sane people wouldn't be particularly sad
if a dragon swooped out of the sky and ate him, but nothing much would
be changed by this admittedly pleasant turn of events. [If we stop
fetishizing the personal, we suddenly remember how to see the
political.]{.underline}

[Letting go of the egocentric moralistic perspective means treating
one's art in a healthier, humbler way. It means not overestimating
resistance to one's aesthetics or identity as a sign that one's work is
inherently revolutionary; it's also a reminder that genuine revolution
has to go beyond art. It's too easy to believe in one's own myth and
neglect to actually participate in the struggle.]{.underline}

Make your art. Sell your art. Don't be ashamed. [But if you want a
revolution, don't stop there.]{.underline}

### Link---Art

#### Their artistry becomes coopted to be another piece in the mass production of capitalism, bolstering the appeal of consumption

**Molina 18** (Mireia Molina, journalist, "What Is Capitalism Doing To
Art?", *concrete*, 1/16/18,
<https://www.concrete-online.co.uk/what-is-capitalism-doing-to-art/>) //
EL

As we walk out of a brilliant art exhibition in any part of the world or
as we finish leafing through countless books in a bookshop, there is
always one last step left, and very often not least, to complete the
artful experience. Get your purse out and start admiring, and inevitably
wanting and even needing those unnecessary, yet very special, artistic
notebooks, postcards or pens.

Klimt's Kiss themed umbrellas, Van Gogh's Cherry Blossom mugs and
scarves... you can even probably find a matchbox with the face of Frida
Khalo stuck on it, and oh, that 2018 diary with deep, daily quotes and
book recommendations would be so useful! I could go on and on, but the
truth is that I would rather spend a whole hour in the souvenirs shop to
see how I can decorate my everyday activities and surround myself with
constant inspiration -- and let the museum make a good profit on it,
too.

However, while you can certainly get some nice room decorations out of
it, this constant production of art generates much debate.

King of artistic mechanisation, Andy Warhol saw in art a chance to bring
the American society together. By making art of Campbell's tomato soup
or a can of Coke, he equally represented the higher intellectual elite
and the poorest people in society. Everyone could buy a Coke, he said,
and it would be equally delicious in anyone's hand.

Warhol's series of Marilyn Monroe or Elizabeth Taylor's faces turned
celebrities into art, and turned art into pop culture. His production of
advertisements and record covers meant art would no longer be exclusive
to the intellectual and artistic circles, or the ones who could afford
it, but anyone could see his artwork in shops or the streets. Whether
you like his work, or his capitalistic philosophy, he in a way made art
accessible to everyone.

[But while this idea can be romanticised when we look at the bold and
bright 20th century pop art, it is not quite as charming
anymore.]{.underline}

[Yes, everyone can now display a Rothko or a Monet on their living room
walls by buying a poster, but only because their distribution is so
generalised we can probably even find it in a supermarket. And while
this is making art accessible, such automatic production does not only
turn art into a product, it can do it to the point where it loses its
meaning.]{.underline}

We have seen Munch's The Scream countless times, and have been fed with
Mona Lisa's face only to end up seeing it behind rows of dozens of
phones and cameras. How can we know if we like Van Gogh's sunflowers if
we have been told they are a masterpiece pretty much all our lives? I do
not want to undermine such artist's works at all, surely they deserve to
have grown to be so popular.

[However, such artistic bombardment might influence our sense of
judgement and might not let us value an artwork for itself. The same
happens with films, or books, which are published with the word
"bestseller'"on their covers as a synonym of "brilliant."]{.underline}

There is no way we can't or shouldn't be influenced by others' opinions.
If anything, they enrich our understanding of art. Reviews and critiques
are the main substance of cultural magazines, and often make interesting
and wonderful articles that make you think twice, even challenging any
assumptions that society itself might have generated.

[It is the massification of art, however, its constant and serried
production, which blurs the line between artwork and product, human and
machinery. And products, in our capitalist society, are made to be sold.
Something as seemingly counter-cultural as the hippie or the beat
generation movement only survived because of their popular spread -- in
fact, Kerouac himself stated there was no such thing as a generation --
and rock bands' logos are turned into T-shirts, creating fashion
trends.]{.underline}

[Paradoxically, art's success is what makes it lose its uniqueness.
Capitalism turns its rebellion into yet another product and sells it to
us, and its popularity makes it lose its meaning. Did we really like
that film we watched, that book which took us so long to finish or the
artist everyone is obsessed with? Or are they just another product that
have been sold to us?]{.underline}

As the forever popular Fight Club teaches, perhaps the "things you own
end up owning you..."

that say it is too narrow; that it overlooks the deeper significance of
what Robin Kelley, following political scientist James Scott, has
usefully summarized as "[infrapolitics": the region of "daily
confrontations, evasive actions, and stifled thoughts."
Hogwash]{.underline}. Twenty years after Reaganism took hold and
twenty-three years after Maynard Jackson, Atlanta's first black mayor,
summarily fired nearly 2000 striking black sanitation workers with no
rooted opposition from the black community, it's time for us to face
some brute realities. [Sure, there's infrapolitics---there always is,
and there always will be; wherever there's oppression, there's
resistance. That's one of the oldest slogans on the left. But it's also
a simple fact of life]{.underline}. People don't like being oppressed or
exploited, and they respond in ways that reflect that fact. That and a
buck fifty will get you on the subway[. "Daily confrontations" are to
political movements as carbon, water, and oxygen are to life on this
planet. They are the raw material for movements of political change, and
expressions of dissatisfaction that reflect the need for change, but
their presence says nothing more about the potential for such a movement
to exist, much less its actuality.]{.underline}

At best, [those who romanticize "everyday resistance" or "cultural
politics" read the evolution of political movements teleologically; they
presume that those conditions necessarily, or even typically, lead to
political action. They don't. Not any more than the presence of carbon
and water necessarily leads to the evolution of Homo sapiens. Think
about it: infrapolitics is ubiquitous, developed political movements are
rare.]{.underline}

[At worst, and more commonly, defenders of infrapolitics treat it as
politically consequential in its own right. This idealism may stem from
a romantic confusion, but it's also an evasive acknowledgement of the
fact that there is no real popular political movement. Further, it's a
way of pretending that the missing movement is not a problem---that
everyday, apolitical social practices are a new, maybe even more
"authentic," form of politics.]{.underline}

### Link---Infoshop

**The 1ac is just an infoshop---precludes any possibility for
revolutionary change. Only change at a level of class consciousness and
organizing is capable of resolving their impacts**

Joel **Olson 13** , associate professor at Northern Arizona University,
"The problem with infoshops and insurrection US anarchism, movement
building, and the racial order", 'Contemporary Anarchist Studies',
published in 2013

[An infoshop is a space where people can learn about radical ideas,
where radicals can meet other radicals, and where political
work]{.underline} (such as meetings, public forums, fundraisers, etc.)
[can get done]{.underline}. In the infoshop strategy, infoshops and
other "[autonomous zones" model the free society]{.underline} (Bey
1985). [Building "free spaces" inspires others to spontaneously create
their own, spreading "counterinstitutions]{.underline}" throughout
society to the point where they become so numerous that they overwhelm
the powers that be. Th[e very creation of anarchist free spaces has
revolutionary implications]{.underline}, then, because it can lead to
the "organic" (i.e. spontaneous, undirected, nonhierarchical) [spreading
of such spaces throughout society in a way that eventually challenges
the state]{.underline}. An insurrection, meanwhile, is the armed
uprising of the people. [According to the insurrection strategy,
anarchists acting in affinity groups or other small informal
organizations engage in actions that encourage spontaneous uprisings in
various sectors of society]{.underline}. As localized insurrections grow
and spread, [they combine into a full-scale revolution that overthrows
the state and capital and makes possible the creation of a free
society]{.underline}.3 [Infoshops serve very important functions and any
movement needs such spaces]{.underline}. Likewise, insurrection is a
central event in any revolution, for it turns the patient organizing of
the movement and the boiling anger of the people into an explosive
confrontation with the state. [The problem is when infoshops and
insurrection are seen as revolutionary strategies in themselves rather
than as part of a broader revolutionary movement]{.underline}. In the
infoshop model, [autonomous spaces become the movement for radical
change rather than serving it. **The insurrection model tries to replace
movement building with spontaneous upheaval rather than seeing upheaval
as an outcome of social movements.**]{.underline} The [infoshops and
insurrection]{.underline} models, in other words, [both misunderstand
the process of social transformation]{.underline}. [Radical change may
be initiated by spontaneous revolts that are supported by subterranean
free spaces]{.underline}, but **[these revolts are almost always the
product of prior political movement building]{.underline}**, and [their
gains must be consolidated by political organizations, not the spaces
such organizations use. **Social movements, then, are central to radical
change**]{.underline}. The classical anarchists understood this well,
for they were very concerned to build working-class movements, such as
Bakunin's participation in the International Working Men's Association,
Berkman and Goldman's support for striking workers, Lucy Parson's work
in the International Working People's Association, and the Wobblies'
call for "One Big Union." (To be sure, there were also practices of
building free spaces and engaging in "propaganda by the deed" in
classical anarchism, but these were not the sole or even dominant
approaches.) [Yet surprisingly much of the contemporary anarchist milieu
has abandoned movement building.]{.underline} In fact, the [infoshops
and insurrection models both seem to be designed, at least in part, to
avoid the slow, difficult, but absolutely necessary work of building
mass movements]{.underline}. Indeed, [anarchist
publications]{.underline} like Green Anarchy [are explicit about
this]{.underline}, [deriding movement building as inherently
authoritarian]{.underline} (for example Morefus n.d.). The anarchist
emphasis on hierarchy contributes to this impatience with movement
building because [the kind of political work it encourages are
occasional protests or "actions" against myriad forms of domination
rather than sustained organizing based on a coherent strategy to win
political space in a protracted struggle. **A revolution is not an
infoshop, or an insurrection, or creating a temporary autonomous zone,
or engaging in sabotage**]{.underline}; [it cannot be so easy, so
evolutionary, so "organic," so absent of difficult political
struggle]{.underline}. A [revolution is an actual historical event
whereby one class overthrows another]{.underline} and -- in the
anarchist ideal -- [thereby makes it possible to abolish all forms of
oppression]{.underline}. Such [**revolutions are the product of mass
movements**: a large group of people organized in struggle against the
state and/or other institutions of power to achieve their
demands.]{.underline} When movements become powerful enough, when they
sufficiently weaken elites, and when fortune is on their side, they lead
to an insurrection, and then perhaps a revolution. Yet in much of the
anarchist milieu today, [building free spaces and/or creating disorder
are regarded as the movement itself rather than components of
one]{.underline}. [Neither the infoshops nor insurrection models build
movements that can express the organized power of the working
class]{.underline}. Thus, [the necessary, difficult, slow, and inspiring
process of building movements falls through the cracks between sabotage
and the autonomous zone]{.underline}. Ironically, [this leads many
anarchists to take an elitist approach to political work]{.underline}.
[Divorced from a social movement, the strategy of building autonomous
zones or engaging in direct action with small affinity groups assumes
that radicals can start the revolution]{.underline}. But
**[revolutionaries don't make revolutions. Millions of ordinary and
oppressed people do.]{.underline}** Anarchist theory and practice today
provides little sense of how these people are going to be part of the
process, other than to create their own "free spaces" or to
spontaneously join the festivals of upheaval. [This is an idealistic,
ahistorical, and, ironically, an elitist approach to politics, one that
is curiously separated from the struggles of the oppressed
themselves.]{.underline} C.L.R. James argues that t[he task of the
revolutionary is to recognize, record, and engage: recognize in the
struggles of the working class the effort to build a new society within
the shell of the old; record those struggles and show the working class
this record so they can see for themselves what they are doing and how
it fits into a bigger picture; engage in these struggles with the
working class, participating rather than dominating, earning leadership
rather than assuming it, and applying lessons learned from previous
struggles]{.underline} (James et al. 1974).4 [This is a much more modest
role for revolutionaries than germinating the revolution or
sparking]{.underline} it, and one that is clearly consistent with
anarchist politics. Yet [the infoshops and insurrectionary models reject
this approach for a top-down one in which anarchists "show the way" for
the people to follow, never realizing that throughout history,
**revolutionaries** (including anarchist ones) **have always been trying
to follow and catch up to the masses, not the other way
around.**]{.underline}

### Root Cause---Cybernetics

#### Cybernetics is the product of advances away from industrial capitalism, we explain their theory but they can't explain ours 

**Harris and Davidson** **'94** (Jerry Harris, history at DeVry
Institute of Technology in Chicago, Carl Davidson, director of
Networking for Democracy, "The Cybernetic Revolution and the Crisis of
Capitalism", 1994,
<http://www.net4dem.org/cyrev/archive/issue1/articles/Cyber%20Revolution/cyberRev.PDF>)
// EL

THE CRISIS AND INFORMATION CAPITALISM Coinciding with the crisis of
accumulation, however, was a revolutionary development in the means of
production. [Advances in computer, microelectronics and
telecommunications technologies have brought major changes to the basic
character of industrial capitalism. The application of knowledge is now
the primary means of new value production.]{.underline} Of course, all
labor has always contained two parts\--the knowledge of how to produce
something and the physical effort necessary to make it. In first wave
society, physical labor encompassed the vast majority of work, whether
it took the form of growing corn, weaving wool or maintaining feudal
manors[. In second-wave industrial society, however, machine technology
and manufacturing increased productivity by a factor of
100.]{.underline} The knowledge of building a lathe or steam engine
reduced the proportion of input of physical labor. [But still the
factory system relied mainly on physical labor and large scale material
assets and inputs to produce value. But in third wave societies, the
application of microelectronics technology has already increased
computer productivity by one million. Intellectual capital, developed
and held by knowledge workers and encoded in software and smart
machines, is the key element of wealth in today\'s information
capitalism]{.underline}. Physical labor and industrial machinery are now
secondary to the value added by information. This has had a dramatic
impacted on both finance and manufacturing, as is allowing capitalism to
develop along new lines. The application of new information technology
has meant that industry can produce more with fewer resources, less
energy and less labor. Plastics have replaced metals, fiber has replaced
copper, and chips are made of sand and clay. In fact computer technology
consists almost entirely of intellectual capital, with raw materials
costing only 1% and unskilled labor 5%. By 1988 the U.S. required only
40% of its blue-collar labor force to produce the amount of manufactured
goods equal to that produced in 1977. From 1967 to 1988, weight per
dollar value had fallen by 43%. By 1985 Japan had increased its output
two and half times with just the same consumption of raw materials and
energy as in 1965. Cars used to contain 1600 pounds of steel; much of
that weight is now replaced with plastics. Thus the application of
intellectual capital\--in this case in the form of design\--has meant
the drastic reduction of both physical capital and the labor force. But
the restructuring goes even further. Because the speed of processing
information has increased, on-time warehousing, niche marketing, and the
elimination of middle management have become possible. Second wave
Industrial society produced mass products in huge factories with a giant
labor force. This necessitated a huge number of middle managers to count
production, oversee workers and move information along the command
hierarchy. [Now the rapid acquisition and deployment of information is
the primary goal of management and corporations have restructured to
insure its movement. With expanded information technology and cuts in
employees, middle managers are a disappearing breed. Timely
information\--which has led to shorter product runs, lower supplies, and
niche marketing\-- also means rapid change and innovation. In essence
the \"creative destruction\" of capital has been
speeded-up]{.underline}. Its reflection in the labor force means more
part-timers and more temporary workers. The most rapidly growing job
category is contingent labor, forming 60% of all new jobs in 1993. This
has increased the downward pressure on wages further. Even during the
\"jobless\" economic recovery of 1993, while profits made a healthy
recovery, the median hourly wages for males fell another 2.7%, [New
technologies, corporate flight, and wage cutbacks have laid the basis
for renewed accumulation, even in manufacturing. But this restructuring
has increased poverty and class contradictions throughout society. The
urban crisis, greater economic insecurity and political instability are
spreading in ever widening circles. Like Catch 22, the system resolves
one crisis only to create another with similar features.]{.underline}

### Root Cause---Disability

#### Disability was given meaning through capitalism's desgination of lack of productivity 

**Phillip 21** (Phillip B, the Red Patriot team, "Disability and
Capitalism, *Red Patriot*, 9/25/21,
<https://redpat.org/2021/09/disability-and-capitalism/>) // EL

[The concept of disability is not necessarily one that is created to
help people in our society, but rather one that is used to label people
as "less than]{.underline}" able to create based on the standards put
forth by capitalists.  [We do not define disability by something that a
person needs, we define it by what a person lacks when compared to an
"optimal" man for the industry bosses]{.underline}.  We know that what
we wish to see from the working class is the principle of "from each
according to their ability, to each according to their needs."  We do
not believe that those who can contribute less deserve less, and we do
not place value on a person based on their level of production.  All
people deserve dignity, equality, and for their material needs to be
met.

In the United States, the life of those with disability is often one of
alienation.  [Both alienation from society and from their labor.  People
labeled as disabled are not given the same opportunities to work, learn,
and interact with the community as those deemed conditionally optimal
for labor.  They are treated as though their labor does not have
equivalent value]{.underline}, and as a result this causes a schism both
within their class and work relationships.  In 2020, only 20% of people
with a disability were employed while 67% of people without disabilities
were participating in the labor force.  People with disabilities often
have to live in group homes as their families are too consumed by work
to give proper assistance.  Material conditions are lacking both for the
families of disabled people and those who are deemed disabled.
 Independence and integration into society begins to crumble as those
with disabilities are not always allowed to make their own choices, but
instead have to deal with routines, caretakers, and bosses who believe
they are unable to reach their goals.

While it is hard to gather information regarding modern communist
countries and disability, we can look at the rhetoric of modern
communists and our history.  [Modern communists call for the abolition
of disability.  It is believed that all people should have their
material needs met, and those who wish to work should have an
opportunity to work to their ability]{.underline}.  We can also see how
disability was handled during Lenin's time; and this gives us insight
into how those with disability were less likely to feel alienated.  In
1921 the All-Russian Cooperative of Disabled People was formed, in 1923
the All-Russian Union of Blind followed suit, and in 1926 the
All-Russian Union of Deaf followed as well.  These organizations
operated as a central democracy run by their members with support from
the national government.  It gave power to the people with these
conditions, and it brought them together as the functioning members of
society that they are.

I hope that we can examine these models in detail and understand how
[empowering those with physical variations, while removing the stigma
that comes with them, can lead to an abolition of the need to separate
those who have different material needs]{.underline}.  I hope that we
can see that the "optimal" man is a figment of capitalist society and
that all people deserve to have a say in their life, labor, and the way
in which they integrate into society.

#### Industrial capitalism created the new class of 'disabled', regarding them as social problems and segregating them out of mainstream life

**Russell 2** (Marta Russell, American writer and disability rights
activist, "Capitalism and Disability", Socialist Register, 1/1/02,
<https://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/issue/view/439>) // EL

CAPITALIST BEGINNINGS AND THECOMMODIFICATION OF THE IMPAIRED BODY The
primary oppression of disabled persons (i.e. of people who could work,
in a workplace that was accommodated to their needs) is their exclusion
from exploitation as wage labourers. Studies show that disabled persons
experience lower labour-force participation rates, higher unemployment
rates and higher part-time employment rates than non-disabled persons.
In the US, 79% of working-age disabled adults say they would prefer to
work, yet in 2000 only 30.5% of those with a work disability between
ages sixteen and sixty-four were in the labour force and only 27.6% were
employed; while 82.1% of non-disabled persons in this age group were
either employed (78.6%) or actively seeking work for pay. Though having
a job does not always translate into an above-poverty-level existence,
[disabled persons' historical exclusion from the labour force has
undoubtedly contributed to their poverty]{.underline}. Disabled persons
are nearly three times as likely to live below the current poverty line
--- 29% live in poverty, compared to 10% of non-disabled people. In the
USA fully one third of disabled adults live in a household with an
annual income of less than \$15,000, while the 300to 400 million living
in developing countries have even less chance of employment and exist in
abject poverty, usually with no social safety nets at all.

Historical materialism provides a theoretical base from which to explain
these conditions and outcomes. Under feudalism, economic exploitation
was direct and political, made possible by the feudal concentration of
land ownership. While a few owners reaped the surplus, many living on
their estates worked for subsistence and disabled people were able to
participate in this economy to varying degrees. Notwithstanding
religious superstition about disabled people during the Middle Ages, and
significant persecution of them, the rural production process that
predominated prior to the Industrial Revolution permitted many disabled
people to make a genuine contribution to daily economic life.

[With the advent of capitalism, people were no longer tied to the land,
but they were forced to find work that would pay a wage --- or starve;
and as production became industrialized people's bodies were
increasingly valued for their ability to function like
machines]{.underline}. Bosses could push non-disabled workers to produce
at ever increasing rates of speed. [Factory discipline, time-keeping and
production norms broke with the slower, more self-determined and
flexible work pattern into which many disabled people had been
integrated. As work became more rationalized, requiring precise
mechanical movements of the body, repeated in quicker succession,
impaired persons --- the deaf or blind, and those with mobility
difficulties --- were seen as --- and, without job accommodations to
meet their impairments, were --- less 'fit' to do the tasks required of
factory workers, and were increasingly excluded from paid
employment]{.underline}. [And so 'the operation of the labour market in
the nineteenth century effectively depressed handicapped people of all
kinds to the bottom of the market'.]{.underline}

[Industrial capitalism thus created not only a class of proletarians but
also a new class of 'disabled' who did not conform to the standard
worker's body and whose labour-power was effectively erased, excluded
from paid work. As a result, disabled persons came to be regarded as a
social problem and a justification emerged for segregating them out of
mainstream life and into a variety of institutions, including
workhouses, asylums, prisons, colonies and special schools.
E]{.underline}xclusion was further rationalized by Social Darwinists,
who used biology to argue that heredity --- race and genes --- prevailed
over the class and economic issues raised by Marx and others. Just as
the 'inferior' weren't meant to survive in nature, they were not meant
to survive in a competitive society. Legislation, influenced by Social
Darwinism and eugenics theory, was enacted in a number of jurisdictions
for the involuntary sterilization of disabled people. Advocates of
eugenics such as Galton, Dugdale and Goddard propagated the myth that
there was an inevitable genetic link between physical and mental
impairments and crime and unemployment. This was also linked to
influential theories of racial superiority, according to which the birth
of disabled children should be regarded as a threat to racial purity. In
the notorious Buck v. Bell decision of 1927, the US Supreme Court upheld
the legality of the forced sterilization of disabled people. [At the
extreme, Nazi Germany determined that disabled individuals were an
economic burden and exterminated tens of thousands of them. But even in
'democratic' America bean-counting logic prevailed: by 1938,
thirty-three American states had sterilization laws and between 1921 and
1964 over 63,000 disabled people were involuntarily sterilized in a
pseudo-scientific effort to prevent the births of disabled offspring and
save on social costs.]{.underline} Whether or not codified into law, the
sterilization of disabled people was common in a number of countries in
the first half of the twentieth century, including Britain, Denmark,
Switzerland, Sweden, and Canada.

#### Capitalism created disability, defining the cost vs production\*

**Russell 2** (Marta Russell, American writer and disability rights
activist, "Capitalism and Disability", Socialist Register, 1/1/02,
<https://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/issue/view/439>) // EL

So, just as capitalism forces workers into the wage relationship, it
equally force-fully coerces disabled workers out of it. Disabled workers
face inherent economic discrimination within the capitalist system,
stemming from employers' expectations of encountering additional
production costs when hiring or retaining a non-standard(disabled)
worker as opposed to a standard (non-disabled) worker who has no need
for job accommodations, interpreters, readers, environmental
modifications, liability insurance, maximum health care coverage
(inclusive of attendant services) or even health care coverage at all.
['Disability' is a social creation which defines who is offered a job
and who is not, and what it means varies with the level of economic
activity. This is because the root cause of the work-place
discrimination experienced by disabled people is to be found in an
accountant's calculation of the present cost of production versus the
potential contribution the employment of a given worker will make to
future profits]{.underline}. If 'disabilities' among the direct
producers add to the cost of production without increasing the rate of
profit, owners and managers will necessarily discriminate against them.
Expenses to accommodate the 'disabled' in the workplace will be resisted
as an addition to the fixed capital portion of constant capital. Hence
the opposition of small and medium businesses, especially the US Chamber
of Commerce, to the 'Americans with Disabilities Act'. Managers and
owners will only tolerate the use of 'disabled' workers when they can
save on the variable portion of cost of production, e.g. by paying low
wages to disabled workers, or through tax breaks and other subsidies. So
an employee who is too costly (i.e., significantly disabled) to add to
net profits at the current level of output will not likely become (or
remain) an employee at all. US Census data consistently show that, as
compared with the four-fifths of working-age persons with no disability
who have jobs, only just over one-quarter of people with a significant
disability do so. Employers and investors rely on the preservation of
the status quo labour system which does not require them to absorb the
non-standard costs of employing disabled workers under the current mode
of production, let alone the 800 million people who are or partially
unemployed worldwide. Consequently, disabled individuals who are
currently not in the mainstream workforce, who are collecting disability
benefits and who could work if their impairments were accommodated, are
not tallied into employers' costs of doing business. [The disability
benefit system thus serves as a socially legitimized means by which the
capitalist class can avoid hiring or retaining non-standard workers and
can 'morally' shift the cost of supporting them onto poverty-based
government programs --- thereby perpetuating their poverty. Being
categorized as 'disabled', however, and the subsequent impoverishment
that so many face when struggling to survive on disability benefits,
serves another class function: it generates a very realistic fear among
workers of becoming disabled.]{.underline} At base, the inadequate
safety net is a product of the owning class's fear of losing full
control of what they do with the means of production; [the American work
ethic is a mechanism of social control that ensures capitalists a
reliable work force for making profits]{.underline}. If workers were
provided with a social safety net that adequately protected them through
unemployment, sickness, disability, and old age, labour would gain a
stronger position from which to negotiate their conditions of
employment. American business retains its power over the working-class
through a fear of destitution that would be weakened if the safety net
were to actually become safe. [Disabled persons who do not offer a body
which will enhance profit-making as labourers are used to shore up US
capitalism by other means. Entrepreneurs and rehabilitation specialists
have made impaired bodies of use to the economic order by shaping
disablement into big business and turning the disabled body into a
commodity around which social policies get created or rejected according
to their market value.]{.underline} The corporate solution to
disablement --- institutionalization in a nursing home, for instance ---
evolved from the realization that disabled people could be made to serve
profit because public financing guaranteed the revenue (in the USA,
Medicaid funds 60% of the cost, Medicare 15%, private insurance 25%).
Disabled people are worth more to the Gross Domestic Product when
occupying a 'bed' than a home. When a single impaired body can generate
\$30,000 --- \$82,000 in annual revenues Wall Street counts it as an
asset that contributes to companies' net worth. Despite the efforts of
the disability rights movement to de-institutionalize disabled
populations and shift policy towards the provision of in-home services,
[the logic of capital reasserts itself via the recommodification of the
disabled body in the home]{.underline} (insofar as public funding
permits --- with the advent of 'managed care', trying to limit costs,
there is an increased financial motive to underserve). Corporations have
taken an interest in the money-making potential of the in-home services
field, and indeed promote the in-home services model as they build their
new 'home-care'empires. [As Jim Charlton puts it, 'the transformation of
people into commodities hides their dehumanization and exploitation by
other human beings: it becomes simply an economic fact of life'. It is
also evident that the definition of disability is not static but
fundamentally linked to the needs of capital accumulation.]{.underline}
[Hence, when the welfare state entered into 'crisis', governments
attempted to narrow the definition of disablement and to cut entitlement
levels.]{.underline} There have also been widespread closures of the
institutions that warehoused disabled people, but without an allocation
of adequate resources and services to enable them to live independently.
Yet this withdrawal of the state from certain types of benefits does not
entail any rupture in the intervention of the state in the lives of
disabled people. The state's interventionist role remains but is
refocused on the ruthless cutting of social expenditures, including
services and income support programmes to disabled people, in the name
of neoliberal efficiency. [The rise of capitalism has thus seen dramatic
changes in the ideological classification and treatment of disabled
people]{.underline}. Yet while socialists have considered the
relationship between the rise of capitalism and, for instance, the
enactment of the English Poor Laws, the classification, marginalization
and oppression of disabled people have been largely ignored. Speaking
generally, the rise of capitalism clearly had contradictory outcomes for
disabled people. On the one hand, there were positive effects in terms
of better medical technology that lengthened the life span and increased
the quality of life for those who could afford it. On the other hand
there were some very negative effects, including classification into
rigid and arbitrary diagnostic categories and incarceration in
oppressive institutions. Exclusion from exploitation in the wage-labour
system, as the 'deserving poor', lies at the core of disabled peoples'
oppression in every aspect of modern life.

Alternatives to That

What would that look like? [What]{.underline}, in short, [is left
foreign policy]{.underline}? Michael Walzer, in his commendable A
Foreign Policy for the Left (2018), is among the few people who have
seriously taken on that question in a practical (as opposed to strictly
academic) context. He gets right the fundamental formulation: left
foreign policy should and must flow naturally from the core values of
the left.

In modern American politics, "defense" and "foreign policy" are
sometimes treated as interchangeable concepts; that's bad[. A basic
first principle for left foreign policy could be a return to the wider,
traditional conception of foreign policy as a toolkit]{.underline}.
Foreign aid, economic agreements, traditional diplomacy, combatting
inequality and violent extremism (including domestically, of course),
and **[[coop]{.mark}eration with international organizations [to
address]{.mark} truly [global issues would]{.mark} all combine to [offer
more]{.mark} potential [than]{.mark} the [current]{.mark}]{.underline}**
bipartisan stance that **[foreign [policy]{.mark}]{.underline}** is best
reduced to "We will bomb the shit out of you or not. Pick one."

A second core principle would be a real commitment to the thing American
foreign policy has paid condescending lip service to for decades: **[the
promotion of democratic institutions in other countries]{.underline}**.
This must obviously stop short of direct intervention in the domestic
affairs of other nations, and [will only be plausible once the United
States deals with its own panoply of problems with voter suppression,
felon disenfranchisement, and other anti-democratic
practices]{.underline}.

A third and more nebulous step must be to define, in accordance with the
left's core values, the "national interest" of the United States. It is
simple enough to say that America must protect "its interests" but much
harder to articulate what those interests are beyond "anything Congress
and the president feel like it is at a given moment." [If the promotion
of economic, gender, LGBTQ+, and racial equality were made a political
priority at home and abroad, the considerable economic power of the
United States could be a game-changer]{.underline}. That will require,
of course, a ground-up rethinking of unregulated free markets as the
basis for all American values and practices. Fortunately the left is
already pretty good at proposing alternatives to that.

Finally and perhaps most obviously, [the nation must shift decisively
away from relying so heavily on military hegemony to advance its
interests]{.underline}. [[Any leftist]{.mark} worth his or her salt
[can]{.mark} tell you that **[reduc]{.mark}ing the
bloated,**]{.underline} economically crippling **[[defense
spending]{.underline}]{.mark}** that is a cornerstone of Washington
consensus politics [is a first step.]{.underline} To implement such
changes will require the same kind of thoroughness and attention to
detail that the left has applied to domestic issues like Medicare for
All. Exactly what will be cut? Why? How will whatever function that
spending performed (if any) be replaced by a more effective form of
foreign policy?

[Articulating a well-developed foreign policy worldview will be aided by
moving beyond today's limited foreign policy
conceptions]{.underline}---to shift the paradigms, to put it in the most
annoying possible terms. Left ideas are usually shoehorned into
easy-to-digest categories like "pacifism" or "isolationism." As the
right has proven repeatedly, **[coming up with better language with
which to communicate ideas to voters will be essentia]{.underline}**l.

HyperSimplification

Look, I don't have all of the answers, and to be frank and crass, if I
did I would not likely give them away to the world for The Baffler's
going rate for freelance contributions. I am certain, though, that the
current state of left foreign policy is a void that needs to be filled
with something other than the Wikileaks Bro politics, perhaps best
exemplified by the phenomenon that is Tulsi Gabbard, of apologias for
authoritarian nationalist leaders around the world. It is not enough to
identify the obvious flaws in liberal foreign policy, with its
convoluted hawkishness and rebranded military-centered consensus
worldview, and simply conclude that the polar opposite must be the best
course.

Criticizing Hillary Clinton's (or now Joe Biden's) campaign for its
terrible foreign policy stances is the low-hanging fruit. Looking inward
and reflecting on the core goals and values of left politics---rejecting
the allure of Tucker Carlson-approved ideas like "Hey, isn't being
friends with Putin a good thing?"---will be the more challenging part[.
For over a century the United States has been a global Bad
Actor]{.underline}, and it is imperative that it interact differently
with the world. But **[pretending that it alone is a Bad
Actor]{.underline}**, [and the intentions of every other nation will
become honorable as the United States renounces its sinful ways, **is
dumb**.]{.underline}

**[[Foreign policy]{.underline}]{.mark}** is not merely a set of
choices; it also **[[requires responding to]{.mark} events [other
actors]{.mark} initiate]{.underline}**. [This is where modern left views
come up shortest. Non-interventionism is intellectually appealing not
only because it fixes many of the current evils and ills of U.S. foreign
policy]{.underline}---Hey, let's stop starting wars!---but because it
reduces everything to one simple answer. [There is no need to learn
about the Spratly Islands dispute among China and its
neighbors]{.underline}, [**[oppression of]{.mark} the
[Uyghurs]{.mark}**[, **Donbas**, **Syria**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the
multi-sided civil war in Yemen, and other current points of
tension]{.underline}. [Like the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s]{.underline},
**[[confusing]{.mark} foreign [conflicts that do not conform to]{.mark}
the narrative of one [good]{.mark} guy fighting one [bad]{.mark} guy are
difficult for our political system to process]{.underline}**. [The urge
to oversimplify or ignore these conflicts]{.underline}, [especially when
they are]{.underline} distant and **[not perceived as directly relevant
to Americans, is strong]{.underline}**.

[Vestigial organs]{.underline} of the Cold War world order [like [NATO
could]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with a better underlying set of values,
**[be useful]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[tools [toward promoting left
foreign policy goals]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is not to assert that
it will, as America's role in NATO is only as good as the domestic
politics driving it. **[[Collective agreements]{.mark} can be a useful
alternative to]{.underline}**, for example, **[multi-trillion-dollar
domestic defense spending]{.underline}**. America's **[military
alliances [are not inherently bad]{.mark}]{.underline}**; the
[choices]{.underline} our [elected officials make are the
problem]{.underline}. [Growing its foothold in domestic politics will be
easier when the left can advance a coherent foreign policy
worldview]{.underline} that communicates what it intends to do rather
than only what it will not do.

### Solvency---2NC

#### Mutual defense can be [repurposed]{.underline} for progressive ends. NATO is an [effective counter]{.underline} to imperialism.

**Schablein, 18**---chair of the Lower Shore Progressive Caucus, a local
chapter of Progressive Maryland (Jared, "Supporting NATO is
progressive,"
<https://www.progressivemaryland.org/supporting_nato_is_progressive>,
dml)

For my entire life as an activist, [I have been **critical** of the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' foreign policy]{.underline} and
rightfully so. All most **[every]{.underline}** single [**one** of our
nation's foreign [engagements]{.mark}]{.underline} since World War II
[[has been **imperialistic**]{.mark}, **hyper-aggressive**,
and]{.underline} generally **[destructive]{.underline}**. [The US has
found itself [backing]{.mark} **brutal [dictators]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
engaging in **[regime-change]{.mark} wars** that caused **mass
instability**]{.underline} in South America, the Middle East, and
regions [through the world as well as taking part in **military
conflicts** in which we should never have been]{.underline}.

Currently, President Trump like the administrations of old has continued
many of these same reckless policies and pointless aggressive wars.
However, President Trump has taken these reckless policies a dangerous
step further by undermining and trying to destroy agreements and
policies that keep peace and stability in at-risk parts of the world by
constantly attacking our closest allies with false claims and outrageous
rants. [[One of the few]{.mark} current US foreign [policies]{.mark}
that is [**agreeable** and **good**]{.mark} for both the country and
world at large [is]{.mark}]{.underline} the United States' [involvement
in]{.underline} the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, better known as
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

NATO was created on April 4, 1949, with the signing of the North
Atlantic Treaty. Despite popular belief, [NATO was created for **more**
than just countering the political and military threat]{.underline} at
the time in the Soviet Union. [The treaty set up several commitments and
goals for each member nation to uphold and pursue including maintaining
**peace** in Europe, creating **cooperation** among NATO members, and
**mutual defense**]{.underline}. The treaty also commits members to
ideals of democracy, liberty, and peaceful resolutions to international
disputes. [NATO has been able to withstand the test of time because it
has constantly changed and evolved to meet current political and
international security concerns all while maintaining its core goals and
beliefs]{.underline}.

Over the years [NATO has had many achievements. These [achievements
include]{.mark} having **[seven]{.mark} straight [decades of
peace]{.mark}** within NATO borders; forging **[over forty
partnerships]{.mark}** with non-member nations around the world to
ensure **stability**, **peace**, and **conflict reduction**; enacting
**international [crisis management]{.mark}** operations like
**[p]{.mark}eace[k]{.mark}eeping
[o]{.mark}peration[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Kosovo during the late
1990s \-- resulting in the current peace and start of new prosperity in
the Balkans; and working with the African Union to stop piracy off the
coast of Africa \-- resulting in piracy being down 75% since 2011.

Despite all NATO's success, [[there are]{.mark} still [many
challenges]{.mark} that face the world and the alliance that one nation
cannot handle alone. These threats [include]{.mark} **global
[terrorism]{.mark}**[, **cyber attacks**]{.mark}, environmental issues
like **[climate]{.mark} change**, and **[Russia]{.mark}'s aggression**
in Eastern Europe]{.underline} with the illegal annexation of Crimea and
the build-up of military forces along NATO's borders. [NATO is preparing
itself to address these issues by reinforcing its deterrent efforts,
supporting international efforts to maintain stability, investing in
counter-terrorism, combating climate change and preparing cyber
defenses]{.underline}. Together [through **[mutual
defense]{.mark}**]{.underline}, counter-terrorism, and stability
efforts, [the United States through involvement in NATO [can]{.mark}
work with international partners to [**avoid conflict** and **build a
better world**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Despite Trump, most of the grown-ups in his defense and foreign policy
setup want to stay involved in NATO. Why? And why should progressives
care?

[The first major reason to stay involved in NATO is **mutual defense**
and security between allied nations]{.underline}. The biggest component
of NATO's founding treaty is **[[Article Five]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
which establishes that an attack on one member ally is considered to be
an attack on all allies. This important article [[is **crucial**
for]{.mark} many reasons, but principally [providing]{.mark} **more
[resources]{.mark}** to allies in a crisis]{.underline}. NATO has many
different types of countries both big and small from regions across
Europe and North America. [Some smaller nations like the Balkans nation
of **Montenegro** are centered in regions where there have been
**decades of political instability** and **armed conflict**. If an armed
conflict arose, [smaller nations]{.mark} like Montenegro [would
have]{.mark} the **resources** and **[support]{.mark}** needed [from
outside allies to **repel**]{.mark} **outside [attack]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} to help **[protect]{.mark} the country's [people]{.mark}**
[and **sovereignty**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Another positive aspect of [[Mutual Defense]{.underline}]{.mark} is the
fact that it [[builds]{.mark} close [relationships that **spill into
other aspects**]{.mark} of life]{.underline}. It should be no shock that
many of our same NATO allies are also our closest trading partners.
Through trade and international commerce, with other NATO nations, the
United States can sell more goods and collectively grow its economy as
well our allies, creating mutual economic benefit. Finally, [alliances
like NATO make it easier to **share ideas** and **culture** between
nations. The sharing of ideas and knowledge **collectively improves**
and **advances**]{.underline} of [societies across the
alliance]{.underline} from the United States to Estonia and everywhere
in between. [Mutual defense [also]{.mark} serves as [a]{.mark}
**powerful [deterrent]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} prevent **armed
[conflict]{.mark}** or **acts of aggression** toward allied
nations]{.underline}.

NATO's 2014 update, the Readiness Action Plan, sharpens the alliance's
ability to move quickly in fast-moving emergencies, including increasing
rapid-response forces and more mobile, small headquarters.

Terrorism is a persistent global challenge that is one of the biggest
threats to citizens of the United States and all NATO countries.
Terrorism knows no border, nationality or religion, making it a
difficult issue to address and one that no one nation can handle alone.
The US works within the Terrorism Intelligence Cell at NATO headquarters
and in a hub in Naples, Italy to improve threat awareness and
preparedness to respond to attacks -- anywhere in the Alliance,
including the US and Canada.

The third and final major reason the United States should remain
involved in NATO is to maintain stability and prevent conflict around
the world. [NATO establishes **peace** by working with international
partners from shaping policy to building defense capacity]{.underline}.
Over the past several years, [NATO has started **over 450 collaborative
activities**]{.underline} among its 29 member nations and 41 partner
countries [ranging from **cyber defense** to **humanitarian efforts**.
NATO [efforts were **vital** in]{.mark} bringing peace to [the
**Balkans**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the 1990's, [[preventing **World War
III**]{.mark} during the Cold War, [and]{.mark} helping governments
**rebuild [stability]{.mark}**]{.underline} after failed wars [[in the
**Middle East**]{.mark}. Through building international partnerships and
[collaborating]{.mark} with member nations, the United States [can
**reduce**]{.mark} **the number of [conflicts]{.mark}** that take place
around the world and help **bring stability** to at-risk regions of the
world **[without]{.mark} involving major US [presence]{.mark}** [or
**armed conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[It is the goal of all progressives [to create]{.mark} a [US foreign
policy that is **less militaristic**]{.mark}, **expensive** [and
**aggressive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [That is why]{.underline} as a
nation and as a political movement [[we **must remain committed to NATO
involvement**]{.mark}. One of the **most important things** when it
comes to bringing peace and stability is this: [If we **don't want US
troops fighting**]{.mark} in foreign lands, [we need to **maintain our
alliances**]{.mark}. Our commitment must focus on changing foreign
policy to **reduce** the amount we spend on defense and **end** the
number of aggressive wars we enter. As a member of NATO, our allies can
help us achieve that goal by helping in our national security through
**collaboration** and help **maintain stability** by working with
international partners to bring and maintain peace]{.underline}.

That being said, I hope that [[we can **transform US**]{.mark} **foreign
[policy]{.mark}** [from its]{.mark} current **[militaristic]{.mark}**
and **aggressive** [attitude to working with]{.mark} our
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline} to ensure peace through other means and
working to prevent attacks in our own borders [[instead of
**interfering** and causing **instability**]{.mark} in other nations.
This progressive goal can be achieved if we **stay a part of the NATO
alliance**]{.underline}.

## Care CP

### CP---1NC

#### Text: The United States federal government should facilitate and fully resource the establishment of national care infrastructures through progressive and redistributive taxation.

#### The counterplan [transforms]{.underline} the liberal welfare state in ways that foster [radical flourishing]{.underline} and [interdependency]{.underline}.

**Chatzidakis, et al, 20**---Professor in the School of Business and
Management, Royal Holloway (Andreas, with Jamie Hakim, Jo Littler,
Catherine Rottenberg and Lynne Segal, writing collectively as The Care
Collective, "Caring States," *The Care Manifesto: The Politics of
Interdependence*, Chapter 4, 677-805, Kindle, dml)

[The state is a **critical arena** if we are to create any sort of
**universal care**]{.underline}. [States must **cease** to be places
where]{.underline} the interests of **[corporate-driven]{.underline}**
patterns of economic **[growth predominate]{.underline}**, as these
routinely rest upon deepening inequality, including embedded
ethno-nationalism. Instead, [their **first** and **ultimate
responsibility** should be to build and maintain their own **sustainable
infrastructures** of care]{.underline}. This means turning the current
priorities of most nation states on their head.

[A caring state is one in which notions of belonging are based
on]{.underline} a recognition of our **[mutual
interdependencies]{.underline}**, [rather than on ethno-cultural
identity and racialised borders]{.underline} defended in the name of
national security. It is one in which [the provision for all of our
basic needs is assured while]{.underline}, at the same time, [it caters
to the health of the environment and deepens participatory democracy at
every level]{.underline}. The caring state is only successful inasmuch
as it nurtures every human being and other living creatures within its
bounds. And while no state can ever completely eliminate human
aggression, relations of domination, or natural and human-made
disasters, [a caring state provides the conditions in which the **vast
majority** of people can]{.underline}, nevertheless, not only survive
but **[thrive]{.underline}**.

First and foremost, [a caring state must **resource** all the structures
that facilitate the well-being and foster the capabilities or
sustainability of]{.underline} all human and non-human
[life]{.underline} within its domain. For this to happen, [we must
transform the way **belonging** and **citizenship** operate]{.underline}
within current state borders. For many countries, such as the US, [this
will often mean taking the lead from the struggles of **Indigenous** and
**First Nations People**]{.underline}. In line with Canada's Leap
Manifesto, we argue that there must not only be recognition of past
atrocities but also a reckoning with and some form of reparation for
them, whether genocide, slavery and/ or dispossession. [This
will]{.underline}, of necessity, [entail a process of
**decolonisation**]{.underline} and the reclamation of stolen lands as
well as stolen lives. It will also include reassessing how histories of
imperialism and inequality are narrated in public heritage spaces and
educational institutions. Only by confronting the past and prioritising
the needs of those who have been most marginalised, violated and negated
by uncaring nation states will we be able to move forward into a juster
future and cultivate a radically different way of relating to others and
the world itself.

[States]{.underline}, in short, [need urgently to build a **care
infrastructure**]{.underline} based upon a recognition of our profound
interdependencies and vulnerabilities, while putting the necessary
material, social, and cultural conditions in place for the mutual
thriving of all. [Can this be done?]{.underline} [It
**can**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} first [we must
**rethink**]{.underline} the earlier, **[Keynesian
welfare]{.underline}** model.

The Welfare State and Its Discontents

We often hear resentment expressed towards the older generation of
so-called baby boomers, the 'lucky generation'. It was this generation
that largely benefited from the expanding post-war welfare state,
[following the **New Deal**]{.underline} in the US and William
Beveridge's promise, in his famous 1942 Report, to provide care and
support for everybody 'from cradle to grave'. Influenced by Keynesian
economics, with its warning that markets could not be relied upon to
regulate themselves, the new post-war consensus generated widespread
support for far-reaching extension of social services and state
resources. This happened despite the fact that many European governments
were near bankrupt as a result of the war. During this period, in many
countries in the Global North, [the state was understood to be
**responsible** for facilitating the **well-being** of its citizens and
for improving **social infrastructures**]{.underline}, while helping to
ensure decent lives for all -- [whatever the shortcomings in
**practice**]{.underline}, particularly in relation to racialised
subjects and the realities (and eventual legacies) of colonialism. By
the 1950s, for instance, 20 per cent of the British economy was publicly
owned, including most essential services such as transport, energy and
other key industries, and by 1979 almost half the British population
lived in council housing, with the gap between the richest and poorest
lower than ever before.

Similar policies were pursued across much of the Western world,
supported by higher levels of progressive taxation. In the UK, the
pioneer of British social policy, Richard Titmuss, insisted on the
importance of universal benefits, conceived as entitlements, to ensure
all citizens had an equal interest in the state, while judging gross
inequalities to be both 'morally wrong and corrosive of a healthy
society'. In popular radio broadcasts, the British psychoanalyst D. W.
Winnicott highlighted the fact of human dependency, stressing the
essential importance of 'holding environments' for the child, which fed
into ideas about the significance of caring welfare states through
support for mothers and the provision of decent homes and welfare
services. 1

Rethinking the Keynesian Welfare State

[A state organised around care would adopt]{.underline} many of [the
initial post-1945 welfare promises]{.underline}, [while working to
**eliminate**]{.underline} [the **inherently sexist**]{.underline},
**[racist]{.underline}**, [**hierarchical premises** and
**manifestations**]{.underline} of that time, and combating the
anti-immigrant xenophobia still so evident today. [A caring state will
always begin by valuing caretaking over profit-making]{.underline}, and
champion caretaking as a highly valued end in itself. Our vision of a
caring state is one in which each life is understood to have intrinsic
value and where belonging is not defined over and against a racialised
or subordinated other. [The caring state ensures **high-quality** and
**flexible care** that is predominantly **free** at the point of use
during all stages of life]{.underline}, from infancy to old age. [It
provides as well as ensures **affordable housing** and **shared public**
and **cultural spaces** for all]{.underline}, [along with **high-quality
public schooling**]{.underline}, **[vocational training]{.underline}**,
[**university education** and **healthcare**]{.underline}. A caring
state recognises that its infrastructure as well as its day-to-day
functioning depend on a myriad of skills and competencies.

All education and vocational training needs to emphasise care and
caretaking practices, developing the capabilities of each person to hone
their caring skills, while insisting that learning is about enhancing
old as well as discovering new ways to nurture life and the world --
whether in the sciences, humanities, carpentry or cooking. Indeed, [from
early on the caring state cultivates **everyone's** capacity to care by
providing **relevant education** and the necessary conditions for
**mutual thriving**]{.underline}. Such attempts were not only pioneered
in those community nurseries set up by feminists in the 1970s, but, as
we've seen, over the years have been the focus of disability rights
activists and mental health users. Furthermore, once caring and
practices of caretaking become the organising principle of states,
mental health issues will wane. Much of the misery of our times is
inextricably linked to the entrenchment of neoliberalism, the gig
economy and a growing sense of precarity among the 99 per cent. The
caring state would produce substantive solutions to the growing mental
health crisis, rather than inadequate sticking plasters. We need radical
and systemic transformation.

Given our interdependencies, each and every citizen of the caring state
must be recognised as having something of significance and value to
contribute at every stage of life. Thus, a transformation of cultural
norms goes hand in hand with the state's avowal of everybody's intrinsic
dependency, with autonomy and dependency seen as two sides of the same
coin.

Significantly [rethinking the welfare state]{.underline} in this way
also [moves us **well beyond** the traditional]{.underline} domestic and
gendered [division of labour]{.underline}, since both the need to care
and the need for care are understood to be shared by all. This is why
[rethinking the welfare state is also about **rethinking** how public
provision is **conceived** and **distributed**]{.underline}. [The caring
state is **precisely not a paternal**]{.underline}, **[racist or
settler-colonial state]{.underline}**. [Public provision in the caring
state does not revolve around **deepening dependencies** but rather
enables everyone to cultivate]{.underline} what disability studies have
called '[**strategic autonomy** and **independence**]{.underline}',
[while creating the **conditions** that allow for **new
relationships**]{.underline} within and among the state and its diverse
communities -- relationships [predicated on **everyone** receiving what
they need both to **thrive** and to **participate** in democratic
practices]{.underline}.

In other words, [the state]{.underline}, [while **necessary** to manage
the smooth provision of services and resources]{.underline} that enable
communities and caring markets to thrive, [must also be responsible for
facilitating **more**]{.underline}, **[rather than less]{.underline}**,
**[democratic participation]{.underline}**. [A caring state is
**not**]{.underline} a **[vertical]{.underline}**,
**[top-down]{.underline}**, **[disciplinary or coercive]{.underline}**
one, [but instead facilitates]{.underline} what Davina Cooper calls
'[the **creative**]{.underline}, [**horizontal** and **ecological
tending** of present and future]{.underline}'. 2 [A caring
state]{.underline} necessarily [works]{.underline} in the vein of social
justice rather than criminal justice, learning the lessons of
abolitionist feminism [to build **supportive communities** rather than
privatised systems of **incarceration**]{.underline}. It also
imaginatively encourages 'common uses and spaces' by providing open
institutions and resources which can be overseen by citizens through
participatory democratic processes, such as citizens' assemblies. The
caring state, in short, ensures the resourcing necessary for promiscuous
care alongside caring communities to thrive.

[There is **copious evidence** that democratically
controlled]{.underline}, [collectively resourced public services produce
**greater satisfaction** than profit-seeking]{.underline},
[commercialised services]{.underline}. 3 [They **significantly reduce
inequality** and **secure broader solidarity** and
**support**]{.underline}, whatever the tensions they might also
generate. A caring state is therefore one that provides the conditions
allowing for such tensions, disagreements and ambivalences to emerge,
since this encourages deliberation and concerted action. [This means
fostering **institutions**]{.underline}, norms, and communities [that
are **well resourced** and thus best positioned to enable us to work
through at least some of the tensions of routine caring
interactions]{.underline}. Consequently, state provision of care
services is not enough without transforming its modes of delivery.

[A caring infrastructure also entails shorter hours in **paid
work**]{.underline}, to allow adequate time as well as resources for
people to expand their capacity to care, whether in familial or any
other caretaking settings. The best of hands-on care requires the time
to slow down and maintain relational continuity while patiently taking
stock of others in order to enable those being cared for to use or
develop whatever scope they have for personal agency and well-being.
This is why shorter working hours -- as popularised by the campaign for
the four-day week -- is also key to facilitating the conditions that can
educate and expand our capacities for caring, encouraging mutual
participation in democratic deliberations as an integral part of the
provision or need for care. 4 [Once care is prioritised in this
way]{.underline}, [it becomes **easier** to find ways to recognise and
try to meet our shifting dependencies]{.underline}, assisting those who
need to develop or gain control over capabilities others can take for
granted.

From Welfare State to Caring State

Facing collapsing infrastructures and calamities of care and
livelihoods, [there have already been moves to **rethink policies** and
**practices** in certain cities and municipalities]{.underline},
[although **rarely** on a **national level**]{.underline}. Some
administrative regions have begun to offer more support for co-operative
grassroots initiatives for jobs and services, both little and large, as
we saw pioneered in Cleveland in the US and more recently in Preston in
the UK. With homelessness a pressing problem of our time, assistance
with community housing projects has also been growing, while the
exemplary Social Services and Wellbeing Act passed in Wales in 2014
specifically requires local authorities to promote the development of
community and user-owned services. [Such modes of care can]{.underline}
in principle [not only encourage **less bureaucratic** and **more
flexible** targeted services and support]{.underline}, [but help build
that vital sense of **solidarity**]{.underline},
**[agency]{.underline}**, [**community** and **belonging** necessary for
sustaining resource building and caretaking]{.underline}. [We can
**learn from** and **build on** examples]{.underline} such as these. [A
caring state would **facilitate** and help **resource**]{.underline}
precisely these kinds of [**horizontal** and **community-oriented
projects**]{.underline}, [ensuring affordable and decent housing for
all]{.underline}, [while the relationships between the different levels
and scales of governance would]{.underline}, of necessity,
[be]{.underline} ones of [**mutual responsibility** but
also]{.underline} -- and **[crucially]{.underline}** -- [subjected to
**continual debate** and **reflection**]{.underline}.

The idea that we are all entitled to equal access to public resources
when we need them will not banish all of our fears surrounding fragility
and dependence. But it is the only way to lessen these fears and nurture
belief in our shared humanity and interdependence, whatever our
pluralities and shifting needs, especially those we have been encouraged
to disavow and disparage. [Insisting on such priorities]{.underline}
would offer reassurance that those we care most about could always find
forms of support, even if we cannot provide it ourselves. Above all,
prioritising care would also offer the vast comfort of knowing we live
in a world that is capable of valuing all living things within it and,
just as importantly, that works to repair and replenish the resources we
rely upon, whether ecological, manufactured orself-fashioned.

Such a world [**clearly rids us** of old forms of **state paternalism**
with its **gendered**]{.underline}, [**ethnic** and **racial
exploitations**]{.underline}, [**challenging** ingrained and recently
mounting **ethno-nationalism** by creating **more porous borders** for
the movement of people]{.underline}, [while **deepening democratic
practices** on all levels of society]{.underline}. The caring state
therefore not only builds and cultivates an infrastructure of care from
cradle to grave, it also engenders new conceptions of belonging,
citizenship, and rights through necessarily providing for the basic
needs of all. A caring state is ultimately based on a sense of
solidarity towards all its inhabitants, while also enabling what Joan
Tronto calls 'caring with', the idea that [citizens should care not only
for other citizens but for democracy itself]{.underline}.

Thus, belonging, citizenship, and rights must all be organised around
the principle of care rather than by birthplace, identity or national
territorial claims, so that a commitment to care will be the only pledge
of allegiance necessary to live in the caring state's domain. Too many
of those who have provided and continue to provide the bulk of caring
work in wealthier countries have been denied citizenship, even though
they sometimes arrived as children. This was the case in the recent
Windrush scandal in Britain, where West Indian migrants who had lived in
the UK since childhood were unlawfully detained, denied legal rights and
in some cases deported in the 'hostile environment' imposed by the Home
Office. In contrast, new notions of caring citizens and citizenship
would not only help atone for these and other past violations but
completely alter our present and future notions of belonging.

[This is **not** an impossible dream]{.underline}. Here, as with notions
of belonging, [we have much to learn from the history of **Indigenous
struggle** against settler colonialism and extractive
capitalism]{.underline}. In the fight against the Dakota Access
Pipeline, for instance, Indigenous nations from across North America and
beyond established the treaty camps at **[Standing Rock]{.underline}**.
Despite a devastating history of genocide and serial betrayals by the US
government, the camp was not exclusive to Native Americans. Anyone was
welcome so long as they adhered to the values of the camp, which
included a commitment to protect the water and Mother Earth. As the
historian Nick Estes states, whatever their shortcomings, the treaty
camps [offered a vision for an alternative future]{.underline}. There,
'free food, free education, free health care, free legal aid, a strong
sense of community, safety, and security were guaranteed to all.' 5 In
other words, they were designed according to need, not profit. The camps
were [built on **caretaking** and]{.underline} enshrined [a **radically
different vision** of belonging]{.underline}, as well as of relating to
other people and the world.

[Through the creation and resourcing of a **caring
infrastructure**]{.underline}, rejecting all past and current state
violence, [states **can** and **must** be transformed]{.underline}. This
will involve giving priority to those who have historically been most
marginalised, and recognising the right of every inhabitant of the state
to care and be cared for in all care's various meanings and
manifestations. Adopting some of the premises of post-war welfare
states, but refusing their traditional racialised policies, rigid
hierarchies and sexual and racial divisions of labour, [our progressive
vision of states would **undermine the conditions** that produce
economic and environmental refugees and migrants]{.underline}. Indeed,
[if care were to become the **organising principle** of]{.underline} all
[states]{.underline} across the globe, [economic inequality and mass
migration would **decrease** and environmental injustice would be
**rectified** through our mutual commitment to caring for the
world]{.underline}. Ultimately, then, our caring imaginaries must move
away from only caring for one's own, towards the community-building of
radical municipalism and nation states, ending with caring for the
furthest reaches of our interconnected planet. Making this a reality
necessarily involves rethinking and tackling our uncaring economies.

#### Imagining a [caring]{.underline}, [redistributive state]{.underline} facilitates efforts to [repurpose]{.underline} institutions for revolutionary ends [despite]{.underline} their violent history. 

**Pârvan, 21**---Lecturer, MSSP Program, University of Pennsylvania
(Oana, "Technologies of Control and Infrastructures of Redistribution,"
e-flux #123, December 2021, dml)

The legacy of the 2019--21 biennium is yet to be fully grasped and
processed, and often [the urgency of chasing the **next affective
imperative**]{.underline} (be it fear, terror, concern, relief, or
indignation dictated by the virus's iterations) [can **distract** from
looking]{.underline} back [at how]{.underline} rapidly this period has
transformed the world in ways unacceptable before 2019. Superficially,
[**corporate capital** in the form of **techno-giants**]{.underline},
**[big pharma]{.underline}**, [and the **surveillance industry** has
managed to]{.underline} do the unimaginable: [extract]{.underline},
[evade]{.underline}, [and profiteer **even more than
before**]{.underline}, [enabled by **governments**]{.underline} and
central banks---the same governments and central banks advocating for
the resilience, self-reliance, and autonomy of welfare states,
individuals, and real economies. All the while, in many countries, the
mantra of "public health on the brink of collapse" echoed as the best
and most insistent advertisement for private healthcare in decades.

[As more]{.underline} inhabitants [of the planet seemed to **empathize**
with experiences of being immobilized]{.underline},
[terrified]{.underline}, [and collateralized]{.underline}, the
assassination of **[George Floyd]{.underline}** in Minneapolis
[generated]{.underline} the Abolitionist Summer, with [**unprecedented**
multiracial and internationalist resonances]{.underline}. This was the
most affirmative legacy of the biennium, [alongside the activation of
**mutual aid infrastructures** and]{.underline} all the [practices of
**reciprocal nurture**]{.underline} that kept most alive.

According to the Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis, August 12, 2020---the
day the UK's national income declined by over 20 percent as the London
Stock Exchange saw an increase of more than 2 percent---was the symbolic
moment of the decoupling of finance and the real economy. Continuing the
trend that started after the 2008 financial crisis, in 2020 the global
economy was supported by the proliferation of central bank money,
independent of whether profit was made or not. Furthermore, [the
pandemic]{.underline} also [determined a **massive relocation** of value
extraction to digital platforms]{.underline}, which now adhered even
more to people's time, reproductive work, and eventually their lives.
"[Amazon]{.underline}," Varoufakis explains, "[is not a
**market**]{.underline}; [it's a **fiefdom**]{.underline}. And it's a
fiefdom that's [connected to other fiefdoms]{.underline}, [like
Facebook]{.underline}, through the cloud services of Amazon, which are
much greater and bigger than Amazon.com. [It's]{.underline} like [a more
technologically advanced]{.underline} form of
**[feudalism]{.underline}**." In his postcapitalist utopian novel
Another Now: Dispatches from an Alternative Present, Varoufakis depicts
a world in which capitalism died in 2008 thanks to a utilities pay
strike in Yorkshire. [Inspired by **speculative fiction** and
**social-justice movements**]{.underline}, [what are some directions for
**imagining top-down redistribution into existence**]{.underline}? [A
**good starting point** is]{.underline} the \$427 billion in global
[**corporate** and **private tax evasion**]{.underline} in 2020---[money
that could be used to cover the salaries of **thirty-four million nurses
every year**]{.underline}, [thereby granting free healthcare to
everyone]{.underline}. While rich countries are responsible for
facilitating 98 percent of all global tax losses, impoverished countries
are losing "tax equivalent to nearly 52% of their health
budgets."\[footnote The State of Tax Justice, 4.\] A true global
challenge that requires international collaboration, [tax justice can be
achieved by]{.underline} global **[policy measures]{.underline}** such
as the automatic exchange of bank account information between countries,
the registration of the beneficiaries of profits ("beneficial ownership
registration"), country-by-country reporting of the profits of
multinational corporations, a unitary taxation system for corporations
to pay taxes where the real work is done (not where they declare
profits), and, eventually, a UN tax convention, able to be enforced by
tax collectors equipped and funded to do their jobs.

While the Tax Justice Network, an advocacy group consisting of
researchers and activists, has pushed for these measures since 2003,
Covid-19 has brought new challenges in terms of international tax abuse.
The pandemic iteration of capitalism requires customized redistribution
antidotes to what some have called the "Amazon model."\[footnote The
State of Tax Justice, 10.\] One antidote is an excess profit tax

on the large multinational corporations whose profits have soared during
the pandemic while local businesses were forced into lockdown. For the
digital tech giants who claim to have our best interests at heart but
have been short-changing us out of billions in tax for years, this could
be their redemption tax.

[Another antidote is a **wealth tax** on asset values that have exploded
during the pandemic]{.underline}, as in the case of Amazon shares, which
have increased in value by \$60 billion during the pandemic. What if
profit was to be taxed where workers and consumers generate it?
Corporate tax abuse isn't new, but with inequalities dramatically
exacerbated by the pandemic, is it not time to end the "moral bankruptcy
of allowing value to be captured far from where it is
generated"?\[footnote The State of Tax Justice 2020, 9.\]

What to do with a spare \$427 billion then? Varoufakis might claim that
this money isn't even necessary, as the aforementioned central banks
could just divert digital money from corporate finance toward common
citizens, through a personal digital bank account, a portion of which
would represent a form of universal basic income (UBI) not derived from
taxation but rather from a sort of redistribution of global dividends.
Italian feminist Cristina Morini slightly tweaks the notion of universal
basic income, taking inspiration from the Italian feminist movement Non
Una Di Meno. Moroni argues that with waged labor almost extinct and
gendered reproductive labor a terrain of extraction for both
techno-capitalism and the state, [what is needed is]{.underline}
"**[self-determination income]{.underline}**," in other words,

basic income which is self-determined, universal, and unconditional and
[which **does not depend** on job activity]{.underline}, [on citizenship
status or a permit to stay]{.underline} ... [An instrument for everyone
for **preventing gender violence** and for **providing autonomy** and
**freedom** from exploitation]{.underline}, [labor and
precarity]{.underline}.

Can our conception of politics be shifted from the capitalist trope of
producing scarcity for extraction to an ecology of the redistribution of
abundance? Morini's self-determination income not only resonates with
the postworkerist imaginations of time freed from alienation and devoted
to care and art; it also provokes the question of what global
citizenship looks like at a time when many countries are eroding the
rights of elderly citizens, and "denizenship" proliferates at nauseating
speed, with an ever-renewed arsenal of borders and incarceration.

[While this period is]{.underline} certainly [marked by a discursive
emphasis on the public dimension of care and health]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} while [the virus]{.underline} itself [brings forward a
dimension of interdependence that one cannot unsee]{.underline}, the
underlying idea "we are in this together" bears an estranging tone in
the various settings, as [states either abandon public health and
safety]{.underline}, [or enforce isolation and containment]{.underline}.
But [could interdependence become the **foundation of
politics**]{.underline}? [The Care Collective]{.underline}, born out of
a London-based reading group, thinks so. In their book The Care
Manifesto, they [advocate **universal care**]{.underline} **[promoted by
a state]{.underline}**---"**[not a paternal]{.underline}**, [**racist**
**or settler-colonial state**]{.underline}"---[that can]{.underline}

[enable **everyone** to cultivate]{.underline} what disabilities studies
have called "[**strategic autonomy** and **independence**]{.underline},"
[while creating the conditions that allow for **new relationships**
within and among the state and its diverse
communities]{.underline}---relationships [predicated on **everyone**
receiving what they need both to **thrive** and to **participate** in
democratic practices]{.underline}.

[Inspired by **mutual-aid traditions** and **social-justice
movements**]{.underline}, [the ongoing practices that answer the
question]{.underline} "[**how do we care for each other** and the
**planet**?]{.underline}" [should be **only the starting point** for
**altering larger systems** of cohabitation]{.underline}, [like
**markets**]{.underline}, **[constitutions]{.underline}**,
**[states]{.underline}**, [and **neighborhoods**]{.underline}. [This is
how we reach **solutions** and **tools** for
redistribution]{.underline}, [like a return to **public space
making**]{.underline}, **[platform cooperativism]{.underline}**, **[new
municipalism]{.underline}**, replacing outsourcing with
**[insourcing]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} replacing public-private
partnerships with "**[public-commons partnerships]{.underline}**" "in
which co-operative institutions link up with public services and local
citizens with an active stake in their organisations."

Within the discursive moment of this biennium, [the movement for black
liberation and for abolition has been an **indispensable** and
**tireless space** for projecting futures]{.underline}, [imagining
safety]{.underline}, [health]{.underline}, [and thriving not only for
this generation but for many to come]{.underline}. With the Vision for
Black Lives, which was first published during the post-Ferguson movement
of 2016 and then rewritten in 2020, [the **Movement for Black Lives**
built a **policy platform** around the demand to end the war against
black communities]{.underline}, [especially black youth]{.underline};
[black women]{.underline}; [black trans]{.underline},
[queer]{.underline}, [gender-nonconforming]{.underline}, [and intersex
people]{.underline}; [black disabled people]{.underline}; [and black
migrants]{.underline}. [They]{.underline} also [called for]{.underline}
the [abolition]{.underline} of all jails, prisons, and immigration
detention centers; an [end to the death penalty and the war on
drugs]{.underline}; an end to the [surveillance]{.underline} of black
communities; and an end to [pretrial detention and money
bail]{.underline}. And while these demands sound very specific to the
North American setting, are racism and mass incarceration really just
North American? I am specifically thinking about the proliferation of
privately managed maxi prisons in the UK---publicly funded, privately
managed prisons that will eventually have to be filled somehow.

The North American movement for black liberation is a source of
inspiration for at least two reasons. Firstly, [the hegemony of the US
means that its oppressive social and economic ideas can become
**influential** in all communities directly impacted by its geopolitical
reach]{.underline}, [so **understanding the consequences** of those
ideas is **key**]{.underline}. Secondly, [movements like]{.underline}
**[B]{.underline}**lack **[L]{.underline}**ives **[M]{.underline}**atter
[have had]{.underline} political and organizational [victories in one of
the **most hostile** and **militarized**]{.underline} civilian
[environments in the world]{.underline}. [Their methods are thus a
**model** for how marginalized communities **everywhere** can make their
voices heard]{.underline}. In a time marked by terror and isolation,
**[B]{.underline}**lack **[L]{.underline}**ives **[M]{.underline}**atter
[has made space for people **internationally** not only to unearth the
**roots of genocide**]{.underline} in the past [and expose the
**obscenity of racism**]{.underline} in the present, [but also
to]{.underline} "[**radically reimagine** public safety]{.underline},
[community care and how we spend money as a society]{.underline}."
**[B]{.underline}**lack **[L]{.underline}**ives **[M]{.underline}**atter
[put abolition on the **public agenda**]{.underline}, [provoking
**debates** that went beyond]{.underline} merely [defunding]{.underline}
the police. While older generations, in "old media" like tabloids and
talk shows, often dismissed the abolitionist option, [younger
generations were digitally exposed to imaginaries of futures in which
**climate justice**]{.underline}, **[abolition]{.underline}**, [and
**queerness** were embraced and uplifted]{.underline}. [Those seeds of
the future find support in **policy initiatives** like the **Breathe
Act**]{.underline}, a revolutionary piece of proposed legislation
unveiled by the Electoral Justice Project of the Movement for Black
Lives in 2020. The Breathe Act redefines public safety and community
care in an abolitionist direction, which is an indispensable dimension
of present and future redistribution. The proposed legislation calls for

divesting federal resources from incarceration and policing, while
investing in new, non-punitive, non-carceral approaches to community
safety that leads states to shrink their criminal-legal systems and
center the protection of Black lives, by allocating money to build
healthy, sustainable, and equitable communities.

What if the Breathe Act were to inspire other countries to divest from
privately managed maxi prisons or detention centers for migrants, and
invest in public insourced quality healthcare and education, while
redistributing self-determination income for all, irrespective of
citizenship or permission to stay? From feminist theories and political
practices to the Breathe Act, [what is at stake are **different
conceptions** of the state and the public good that
**transcend**]{.underline} all **[previous models]{.underline}** of
welfare, [since they **make visible** those]{.underline} same
[infrastructures of **gendered** and **racialized extraction** on which
states were built and continue to thrive for the benefit of the
few]{.underline}.

As abolitionist geographer Ruth Gilmore Wilson teaches, "if unfinished
liberation is the still-to-be-achieved work of abolition, then at bottom
what is to be abolished isn't the past or its present ghosts, but rather
the process of hierarchy, dispossession, and exclusion that congeal in
and as group-differentiated vulnerability to premature death." A horizon
of [redistribution]{.underline} in the context of the pandemic iteration
of capitalism [is **intrinsically opposed** to carceral practices and
inspired by]{.underline} the longevity of what Gilmore Wilson calls
"**[abolition geography]{.underline}**," [which]{.underline}
"[is]{.underline} capacious (it isn't only by, for, or about Black
people) and specific (it's [a guide]{.underline} to action
[for]{.underline} both understanding and [**rethinking** how we combine
our labor with each other and the earth]{.underline})," which "takes
feeling and agency to be constitutive of, no less than constrained by,
structure," and which is "a way of studying, and of doing political
organizing, and of being in the world, and of worlding ourselves."

#### imagining new forms of care politics opens up the space to incorporate different relationships to care. that increases interdependence and multiplicity.

the Manifesto -- Steps toward Making It an Achievable Dream." Social

[The Care Manifesto is a timely volume coming as it does in the middle
of a pandemic when the value of care for our countries and communities
has been reinforced]{.underline}. We increasingly hear about the
importance and value of care---[care in hospitals, in communities,
within families, and in myriad other places and spaces.]{.underline}
[Some of these care needs arise from the lack of care in other places;
friendships, family networks, and other circles of care that have been
left attenuated as people deal with the ravaging effects of
COVID-19]{.underline} on work, social life, and kinship networks. The
ability of people to belong to affective communities---to meet and
greet, to hug those whom they love, i.e. to express care in quotidian
ways, have all been paused at best and removed at worst as the death
toll from the pandemic rises. **[The lack of care is also an inheritance
of uncaring economies and states.]{.underline}** The Care Manifesto is a
stark reminder that to be in the world requires caring relationships.
The book highlights how and where care survives and thrives, the
practices that enable these, and what is required to make a more caring
world.

[The book's main target is the diminution of care through careless
policies driven by neoliberal political--economic structures. **It
traces why and how care has come to not matter**]{.underline}. Reading
this crisis as conjuncture (Hall and Massey 2010) [enables the authors
to analyze the devastation caused by uncaring neoliberalism and argues
persuasively for redoing the basis of what is valued, and how, in
contemporary (Western) society.]{.underline} This
[requires,]{.underline} as the authors argue, ["the opposite of the
temporary 'care fixes' engineered by so-called compassionate
capitalism"]{.underline} (61). They highlight the inequalities and
injustices in the world into which COVID-19 arrived. [These inequalities
always existed but were highlighted and deepened by
COVID-19]{.underline}. However, like all crises, **[COVID-19 also offers
political possibilities]{.underline}**. [What are the new openings
offered at this moment and how do we forge a more caring
society?]{.underline} Given the ravages to the economy, how do we start
again by valuing what we saw was essential for remaking our societies.
[How do we remake a caring world through networking successful
experiments around care?]{.underline} Hence, as important as the word
care in the title is the word manifesto.

Manifestos are a call to action, to much-needed action. They are more
than a vision; they also need to offer a blueprint for change. The
volume is organized through some elements of such a blueprint. As a
manifesto it is ambitious, calling for wholesale change---of
communities, families, states, economies, of the world. The volume
offers a clear and compelling vision that is set against existing
problematic care practices. The volume then helpfully makes the case for
the manifesto as a deliverable good through examples, most of them from
the Global North, i.e. the location of the authors. The collective
offers hope that [a more caring future is already in the making and that
networking these examples, scaling up, and learning from each other can
provide a way out of the carelessness that marks so much of the
present.]{.underline}

In the rest of this commentary, I want to point to some areas of tension
that, I suggest, need to be addressed if we are to make the manifesto
achievable. They are highlighted by the authors as the ambivalences and
paradoxes that are inherent to care. These ambivalences offer a starting
point, not for unpicking the brilliant vision of the volume but for
making that vision a reality. As the authors argue, addressing these
ambivalences is crucial for mapping a way forward.

After all, working with and through ambivalence and contradictory
emotions is key to building democratic communities. [Conversely, only by
deepening participatory democracy, a core element in our broader vision
of creating a more caring world, can we hope to properly work through
the many ambivalences of care]{.underline}. And **[although we can never
eliminate care's difficulties, we propose that we can mitigate them once
we start building more caring kinships, communities, markets, states and
worlds.]{.underline}** (36--37).

It is in that spirit that I offer my comments.

Caring for the Manifesto

[So how do we care for the Manifesto? How do we make it come to
fruition? This is where carefully working the ambivalences inherent to
the production of care needs to be exposed and addressed]{.underline}.
In this section, I point to some of these.

Care as Affect

[The Care Manifesto defines care as a]{.underline}

[social capacity and activity involving the nurturing of all that is
necessary for the welfare and flourishing of life.]{.underline} Above
all, **[to put care centre stage means recognising and embracing our
interdependencies.]{.underline}** In this manifesto we therefore use the
term 'care' capaciously to embrace familial care, the hands-on care that
workers carry out in care homes and hospitals and that teachers do in
schools, and the everyday services provided by other essential workers.
(11)

However, what is gained by focusing on care and what is lost? [Care is
affective and threaded through with emotions---love, happiness but also
anger and pain]{.underline}. Feminists argued that social reproduction,
the lens widely used in the 1970s and 1980s, was not adequate because
affect and its uncertainties and instabilities, but also rewards, had to
be part of the mix. [To move to care would be to take on that affective
register, to see care not only as work, as ethical demand, or a
responsibility but to show where the affective dimensions to care for
people and the environment everywhere on earth will come
from]{.underline}. The Manifesto briefly focuses on how "\[s\]ympathy
and solicitude, like all other human emotions, always fluctuate,
frequently at odds with other needs, desires, and affective
states---such as personal gratification and recognition---or entangled
with feelings of guilt or shame" (34).

However, [affect is also the stuff of neoliberalism. Neoliberalism too
plays with affective registers]{.underline}. Feelings of guilt and shame
mix with personal gratification as we shop for goods that are produced
through uncaring practices. The happiness we get from using those goods
is instantaneous and therefore outweighs the longer-term benefits of
dismantling exploitative modes of production. [People care for both but
often choose one form of care, gratification, and a feeling of
self-care, over the other, of caring for and bringing together a more
caring world that is attentive to those who are not always
"present."]{.underline} In effect, **[one has to deal not only with how
neoliberal subjects but also neoliberal subjectivities are
produced,]{.underline}** as people struggle with their different,
simultaneous desires and hopes. A recent essay by Harry Pettit (2019)
focuses on young people and the role that hope plays in producing their
desires and aspirations. It outlines the everyday practices and
mediations through which these hopes are fostered and how neoliberalism
therefore gets legitimacy even as it produces precarity. Perhaps one
step toward achieving the collective's ambition would be to look at
disciplines not currently covered in the Manifesto. [There is a vast
literature on care in social psychology and in education that has much
to teach us about why people don't care, or, more often, care less about
somethings than others.]{.underline} There are gradations to care and it
is these gradations that make caring complex, ambivalent. People are
literally between different intensities of affect, toward those who are
near and far, those whose care we value most. It might be easier if we
only had to sort out an uncaring world!

Besides, care is increasingly mediated. When a family member feeds you
stories of hope based on neoliberal promise, often in quotidian ways
such as a text message or messages shared on social media platforms,
they take root in ways that are hard to dislodge. [The power of such
mediated forms in producing affect and of how these circulate, get
amplified, and realized have to be taken on squarely if we are to
dislodge the seductive powers of neoliberalism.]{.underline} How do we
strengthen some affective registers and what is the work that has to be
done to simultaneously take account of caring and less-caring emotions
that circulate across media? Will time and resources be enough or do we
need to deal with these at the level of affect, through educating
ourselves to be attentive to the affects that are caring and how they
can be fostered not only face-to-face but also in increasingly mediated
relationships? In particular, the role of media of different forms in
shaping these affective registers, how these circulate, fall on fertile
grounds and are fed through the very sites that the collective focus
on---family, community, state, and economy---needs more attention. [We
need care to take on the affective in neoliberalism if it is to be
effective. The effect of neoliberalism is real, present, compelling. It
competes with and subverts the forms of care that the Collective
envisions]{.underline}.

Care as Labor

[One thing that COVID-19 showed us is that not all key workers were care
workers.]{.underline} They were engaged in social reproduction, working
as "delivery drivers and garbage collectors" (92). For me, these tasks
are better captured through social reproduction, a term that includes
all the different activities and relationships that are necessary to
maintain everyday life (Glenn 1992). Social reproduction encompasses a
range of activities that can't be considered caring (Kofman and Raghuram
2015). To expand the definition of care to include all the tasks
envisaged in this volume might actually be a disservice.

I am particularly concerned to focus on social reproduction because it
highlights the labor required to care and how people are compelled to
care, and constrained from opting out of caring. [The distinction
between work and care is tricky when care is work. For some, this work
is monitored and managed through institutionalized processes of working
lives]{.underline}. [Such carers are commanded about what constitutes
appropriate and adequate care, by employers and by regulators. **Not
caring looks like a privileged option**]{.underline}. Attuning to the
difficulties of caring requires going to other sources. [It needs us to
listen to those who have cared under difficult circumstances, not just
ideal circumstances]{.underline}. While the Manifesto aims to imagine
another world where care is not only labor, it also has to take account
of the views and perspectives of those for whom it is largely labor.
This might help us to better achieve the vision of the Manifesto, to
ensure that the challenges of care as work too can be addressed.

Care comes with a high degree of responsibility. [This responsibility
can be redistributed through a caring state and a caring economy, but
these only go so far. Ultimately the immediacy of care---of needing to
make a decision on the care requirements of a child, often not your own,
and weighing that up against caring for yourself, requires making tough
choices. It requires resolving or at least accommodating different
values in time.]{.underline} As the Manifesto points out, existing forms
of commanded care sit uneasily with the immediacy and creativity
required to care attentively, in time and in place. Both responsibility
and immediacy must be managed simultaneously. However, caring families
and communities have depended on those who are least privileged to
juggle these values, to make decisions, and to come up with caring
solutions. There is no clear right in these choices---ambivalences can
have ambiguous outcomes. The Manifesto attempts to lay out a clear path
but perhaps the path is not quite as self-evident or straightforward.
Experimentation comes with misses and errors. What are these failures
that we should be aware of? One way forward in realizing the Manifesto's
ambitions would be to draw on insights from literatures in the caring
professions and from those focusing on social policy. They point to some
of the ambivalences that care as a vision has navigated.

Race and Care

[Much of care is theorized through the experiences of the unnamed white
body. However, caregiving is deeply racialized]{.underline}. The Care
Collective recognizes the extent to which the divide between those who
care and the cared-for has been drawn across gender lines, especially as
these intersect with class and race. However, these racialized and
classed formations are not easily dismantled. For instance, Uma Narayan
(1995) has pointed to how [care and justice were both handmaidens of
colonialism. Racial difference and coloniality were produced and
justified using the language of care.]{.underline} These different
inheritances of care mean that the racialized body has very different
embodied and institutional memories of care. Care has inheritances that
need to be taken into account if we are to produce a more caring world.
[These inheritances are not stable or whole. They already carry within
them other openings and starting points but these need to be explored
and taken on board.]{.underline}

Bodies that have not received care raise very different questions for
how to shape a care manifesto. Race, for instance, needs to be
foundational in conceptualizing care as care practitioners have
discovered. For instance, Audrey Thompson (2004) illustrates how only
Black teachers recognized the different care needs of children of color
and they use "colourtalk" to assist Black students in combating racism.
Color talk "decentres and denormalises Whiteness" (Thompson 2004, 33).
These different embodiments of care are most stark in writings on
enslaved families, where "caring for" may involve killing the child who
is born into slavery (Noxolo et al. 2008). Race and racism redefine care
in the most intense and painful ways imaginable. How do we engage such
racialized bodies in The Care Manifesto's vision?

[The histories of carelessness and carefulness are not only embodied but
also institutional, shaping the very definition of care]{.underline}.
For instance, Micheline van Riemsdijk (2013) found that Polish migrant
nurses in Norway, who may be deemed white, have their knowledge devalued
because of the history of how Poland has been viewed, in Norway, as part
of a "less advanced" Eastern Europe. Care was produced and viewed
through these racialized histories so that care as a category was itself
mutable and changing in the context of race. To be looked after by
racialized people is to feel not cared for. White bodies too are
racialized through the complicated histories of place, making whiteness
too a complex category**[. The importance of geopolitical formations in
the valuing of care takes care outside the individual alone and places
it centrally within the politics surrounding the reproduction of
societies, including its histories]{.underline}** (Kofman and Raghuram
2015).

Care has been dislocated from Black bodies in multiple ways and these
dislocations have to be accounted for when shaping a caring world. As
the Black Lives Matter struggles have shown us, it is not enough to say
all lives matter. The histories of racialized and classed injustices
require reparation and not just equality. This is not to decry the
vision of a caring world for which the Collective argues. [Rather it is
to suggest that alongside this vision we need to involve others whose
experiences of care may be very different, those that have different
embodied and institutionalized experiences of care.]{.underline}

Situate and Translate

Care is not only dislocated from some bodies but is also located
differently in different places. For example, the critique of
neoliberalism and the erosion of the welfare state, one of the prime
targets for the volume, is a very particular phenomenon---located in
some Global North countries[. Most countries have never had welfare
states; in others, welfare measures are being instituted for the first
time, sometimes through the influence of global policy and driven by
conditionalities to loan]{.underline}s. Sharkh and Gough (2010) usefully
outline some of these variations---highlighting seven welfare regimes at
the time that they were writing. These include the proto welfare states,
which combine fairly high state spending commitments and welfare
outcomes with conservative stratification, informal liberalism, and
family provision (e.g. many Eastern European and Latin American
countries); the "successful informal security regime" which combine
informal and formal welfare with marketized social welfare and is seen
in countries such as East Korea and Taiwan; a set of regimes with high
informal security systems but with poor outcomes on a combination of
these characteristics such as high inequality, large gender differences
in welfare outcomes (South Asia), high morbidity (Southern African
countries with HIV); and finally a set of insecurity systems with not
only low but falling indicators of welfare (many in sub-Saharan Africa).
[It is in these latter countries that any newly introduced welfare
systems, instigated through global social policy instruments, are
improving things, not worsening them. Thus, not every place is
undergoing neoliberalism or reductions in care in the same ways. Place
matters so care needs to be situated.]{.underline}

There are also place variations in how patriarchy and racism, the
interrelated but distinctive other bases for the lack of care, play out.
Both exist everywhere but take different forms across the world.
However, patriarchy is often the primary lens for thinking through care
arrangements in the Global South while those in the Global North are
seen as an effect of neoliberal policies. How far are we able and
willing to look at patriarchal practices within our own homes and
workplaces in the Global North?

This is not to argue for geographical exceptionalism, i.e. to only
attend to local variations in care, in caring institutions, or in moral
values, because doing so would mean that each locale would be seen as
disconnected and unique. As Subrahmanyam argues, these "area specialists
will merely find themselves either 'fitted in' to a big picture, or
'left out'" (Subrahmanyam 1997: 744). As I have argued elsewhere
(Raghuram 2012), what we need is to rethink how global care is being
made up differently through the multiple forms of care arrangements and
conceptualizations that make up the globe. Each locale has its own
distinctive way of thinking care but this multiplicity must play a
constitutive role in making the global. The narratives of global care as
it exists today need undoing and redoing if we are to globalize care
effectively and appropriately. We need to recognize the complex
genealogies, commitments, and claims (Tsing 2005) that make up the
globalizing world of care. Importantly, this requires a series of
networking moves, sharing and translating across caring manifestos in
different places, to learn from other examples of how care could be
done, to use this to question our own notions of care.

These translations occur not only across differences between places in
how care plays out but also through spatial entanglements. In my own
work, migration represents one axis for these entanglements. Migrant
care for nonmigrants, the care of migrants, the intermingling of
migrants from different parts of the world, many but not all of whom are
working in the care sector, and those who migrate to receive care, all
have to negotiate the different understandings of care globally. They
have to resolve place-based variations in care arrangements, affects,
and hopes, translate them and make them work. Learning from them is an
important step for realizing the vision of the Manifesto.

Moreover, [care also highlights relationalities and interconnectedness,
making it difficult to craft boundaries between social, political, and
economic forms of organization]{.underline}. For instance, communities
can operate not only as caregiving or organizing units but also as
economic forms. Similarly, familial care is embedded within household
and extra-household economics and is shaped by the state. It is always
tricky to draw lines between chapters in a book, never more than when
dealing with care. [But ambivalence involves multiple values that can be
oppositional between these sectors and places of care. Situating,
relating, and translating care are all needed to make the world a more
caring place.]{.underline}

In Conclusion: Writing about the Manifesto with Care

Caring about the Manifesto as a volume perhaps required inviting and
engaging others from across the world into the Collective.. For
instance, so much care in many of the countries from which the authors
write is provided [If we are to talk about universal care, then this
includes listening to the voices of those who have cared under difficult
circumstances, racialized carers, and those from across the
world]{.underline} by migrant workers from countries such as the
Philippines. What does a caring manifesto look like from their
perspective? Moreover, what is the provenance of these knowledges? How
do we stop these from being addendums to an already crafted argument?
Moreover, who is allowed, or enabled to make those much required
critiques of patriarchy in the Global North, which too underpins the
lack of care we see there? How do we increase the orbit of feminism to
make these conversations possible (Narayan 2019)?

[But I also want to write about this Manifesto with care, not as
critique or through the lens of deficit but as an important step in a
journey that many of those thinking about care are taking]{.underline}.
The Collective's Manifesto remains a brilliant intervention about which
we need to think and write with care. The volume is clear in putting
care right at the center of our lives. I hope what I have done here is
to suggest some meaningful steps to make their vision possible so that
the vision does not remain an "impossible dream." I look forward to the
journey!

### State Key---2NC

#### Creating a public ethic of care retools institutions towards the responsibility for care.

Care Ethical Perspective on Institutions." Care Ethics, Democratic

Public Ethics of Care and the State's Public Policies

**[Over the past two decades, care theorists have adopted, roughly
speaking, two different strategies in rethinking the institutional
boundaries of caring.]{.underline}** [Some care ethicists maintain that
"the family is preeminent among institutions and places where caring
projects unfold]{.underline}" (Ruddick 1998, 13; cf. Tronto 2001, 76)
and [propose to move from the (post-patriarchal) family or the home
'outward' in order to use the caring characteristic of these
institutions to "build a public ethic of care"]{.underline} (Noddings
2002, 301; cf. Kittay 1999, 133). On this account, "[a social theory (or
guide to public policy) that builds from the home outward will require
changes in many of our institutions and even in the idea of
institutions"]{.underline} (Noddings 1998, 68). [Other care theorists,
in contrast, propose that "**care should be positioned in notions of
citizenship rather than family**"]{.underline} (Sevenhuijsen et al.
2003, 299) and argue that "[the community, as represented by the state,
has primary responsibility for care of its citizens, and ... citizens in
turn have the right to nonfamily care]{.underline}" (Glenn 2000, 90). On
both accounts, however, [it is the aim of a 'public ethic of care' to
ensure that (1) caring is legitimated as a collective (public)
responsibility; (2) access to care -giving and care-receiving is
relatively equally distributed and not dependent on economic or social
status; and (3) the responsibility and actual work of caring is shared
equitably and does not fall disproportionally on disadvantaged
groups]{.underline} (cf. Glenn 2000, 88).

Now, whatPaternalism does all this mean, if we are to translate this
view into the real life of our societies and institutions? First, it
means different things in different contexts, since the actual social
and political institutions in which caring is discussed, decided upon
and done differ with respect to particular social, cultural and
political environments. The idea of a 'public ethic of care' has
therefore inspired a number of critical analyses of current
institutional arrangements of caring in various geographical and
cultural contexts worldwide as well as a number of concrete proposals
for public policies that are centered around the idea of the collective
responsibility for care and the right to the equal access to adequate
care-giving and care-receiving (cf. Clement 1996; Ruddick 1998;
Sevenhuijsen 1998; Kittay 1999; Glenn 2000; White 2000; Tronto 2001;
Noddings 2002; Sevenhuijsen et al. 2003; Hankivsky 2004; Barnes 2006;
Held 2006; Engster 2007; Stensöta 2015). With respect to the role of the
state and its institutions in realizing a 'public ethic of care', care
theorists elaborated in particular on an ethical justification of the
welfare state (Sevenhuijsen 1998; Kittay 1999; Glenn 2000; Engster 2007)
as well as a criticism of paternalistic and neoliberal forms of the
state care provision (White 2000; Tronto 2001; Held 2006; Barnes 2012).
Daniel Engster (2015) recently proposed what is perhaps the most
comprehensive and detailed account of a public ethic of care so far,
which in a systematic way applies care ethics to a number of social
policy areas, such as health care, child care, old age, and poverty, and
suggests how the basic institutions of a caring welfare state should be
designed.

Yet, it is not the aim of this chapter to explore the existing proposals
for a public ethic of care in detail. Our previous discussion shall
suffice to make the case that [any full-blown moral and political theory
of care has to deal with the structure and functioning of our social and
political institutions.]{.underline} **[The institutional approach in
care ethics sees care as a collective responsibility that needs to be
realized through various social and political
institutions]{.underline}**. **[To take care as a crucial element in the
life of all individuals and communities means to challenge the current
institutional arrangements of caring and propose alternative ways of
organizing care in our societies and polities.]{.underline}** This
conclusion puts us in a better position to see the shortcomings of the
famous critique proposed by Alison Jaggar who suggests that "care's
emphasis on individual responses to immediate needs ... encourages what
are sometimes called band-aid social work approaches to moral problems
rather than efforts to solve them institutionally or prevent their
occurrence through social changes" (Jaggar 1995, 196). Such a criticism
toward care ethics is not only "overstated", as Hankivsky (2004, 34)
noted, but rather completely inadequate when applied to the
above-discussed views that represent the institutional approach in care
ethics.

[Given the care ethical insight that care should be positioned in the
notion of citizenship and that the state has primary responsibility for
ensuring access to adequate care-giving and care-receiving for all, the
state and its institutions that serve this goal must be of prominent
interest]{.underline} for care ethicists. In the following section[, I
want to turn attention to the question of how a care ethics perspective
on institutions can be applied to the domain of public
administration]{.underline} . Hence the chapter shifts its focus from a
care ethical discussion of [the institutional boundaries of caring and
the design of public policies to a care ethical discussion of how the
provision of public services and goods should be best
administered.]{.underline}

Public Administration and Caring Institutions

Public administration can be defined as a cooperative group effort in a
public setting that comprises of those activities that are involved in
implementing the policies and programs of governments but also have a
role in the formulation of public policy. Theoretically public
administration is an interdisciplinary field of study that examines the
structure and workings of institutions that are charged with the
administration of governmental functions and studies the behavior of
officials responsible for the conduct of these functions. [The aim of
this section is to take a closer look at existing attempts to apply a
care ethics perspective to public administration theory and
practice.]{.underline}

Care Ethics and Public Administration

Let us start by taking a quick look at how care ethics was first applied
to educational administration in the early 1990s. Drawing on Noddings'
(1984, 1987) ideas about the educational reform, Starratt (1991) and
Beck (1992) argue for introducing care ethics and the values of caring
in educational leadership and administrative practice. Building on
Noddings' (1984) and Gilligan's (1982) view that care ethics should aim
at fostering growth, connection and nurturing relationships, Beck argues
that care ethics would "lead administrators to listen to and value
persons in the context of their communities' schools. It would encourage
them to involve students and teachers in problem solving, allowing them
'access to decision-forming arenas'" (Beck 1992, 482). Care ethics,
these theorists argue, would reorient educational administration from
its current exclusive emphasis on the values of effectiveness and
competition to the values of care. It would foster "open, trusting,
professional communication" (Starratt 1991, 196), recommend opting for
"cooperative strategies" (Beck 1992, 476) and aim at reducing "the
Paternalism artificial separations that cripple caring relations"
(Noddings 1987, 27). Davidson (1994) widens the scope of investigation
to public administration in general. She identifies, following Noddings
(1984), the care perspective as a 'feminine perspective' and argues that
deploying this perspective in public administration would "revitalize
our demoralized public organizations ... and create opportunities for
enhanced interpersonal relationships---both within our bureaucracies and
between these bureaucracies and the communities that serve" (Davidson
1994, revised in Scranton and Ranney 2001, 579).

Yet, a problem with these first attempts to apply care ethics to
administration lies in deploying the above-discussed narrow view of
caring as a nurturing personal relationship. This reduces the
perspective of these scholars to a narrow focus on promoting connection
and personal growth within the institutional context. Moreover,
Davidson's account of 'feminine administrative behavior' is clearly open
to the objection of gender essentialism which is related to serious
issues identified by early critics of the 'feminine approach' in care
ethics (cf. Tronto's 1987 criticism of Noddings).

In contrast[, DeLysa Burnier's proposal for a 'care-centered public
administration' draws on Tronto's (1993) argument for a political ethic
of care]{.underline} and [takes]{.underline} as a point of departure
Fisher and Tronto's (1990) **[broad definition of caring as a social
practice which, if fully accomplished, comprises four interrelated
phases of caring-about, caring-for, care-giving and
care-receiving.]{.underline}** Burnier also builds on a feminist
approach to public administration developed in the pioneering works of
Camilla Stivers (1991, 1993, 1994, 2000). In her groundbreaking 1991
paper, Stivers draws attention to women's historical exclusion from
public administration theory and suggests four areas of public
administration where a feminist perspective might offer fresh insights:
(1) the question of administrative knowledge, (2) the model of the ideal
public servant, (3) the nature of administrative discretion and (4) the
dimensions of the administrative state. Most importantly, Stivers argues
for a feminist rethinking of the very ground of administrative
legitimacy, which would base legitimacy and accountability of
administrative discretion not only on the individual conscience and the
internal processes of a particular agency but on substantive
collaboration with affected others which aims at the inclusion of a
diverse range of perspectives. A feminist account of administrative
practice foregrounds the view of power as a form of "enabling capacity",
stresses "the possibility of leadership as facilitation rather than
giving orders, and authority as accountable expertise rather than a
chain of command" (Stivers 1991, 59).

In what follows, I want to discuss DeLysa Burnier's proposal for a
'care-centered public administration' in detail. On Burnier's view, a
care ethics perspective (1) provides an alternative 'assumptive base' of
public administration; (2) complicates the conventional founding and
historical narrative of the discipline; (3) legitimizes a 'relational
leadership' approach in public administration (Burnier 2003, 535--540).

Bureaucracy with its emphasis on the efficient and neutral delivery of
public goods and services represents the traditional foundation of
public administration. The New Public Management reforms of the 1990s
changed this foundation dramatically by replacing bureaucracy with the
principles of the market centered around the value of efficiency. The
governmental delivery of goods and services to citizens was transformed
into market transaction where private providers of services compete for
customers seeking to maximize their choices. As it is well documented in
literature on public administration, the New Public Management reforms
deprived the public sector of its more traditional moral values and
permitted "a widespread practice of the administration of services to
develop that destroys the very idea that the providing organizations
could be matters of public concern" (Hirst 1997, 127; cf. Hoggett 2005).
Now, given the financial and ethical crisis that resulted from an
increased market orientation, Burnier argues, it is not only "imperative
that administrators who believe in government's public mission retake
center stage and regain control of the public agenda" (Burnier 2009a,
399) but **[what is needed is "a care transformation of the public
sector" which "values care, makes care work visible, and places care
values and practices at the center of public administration scholarship
and practice"]{.underline}** (Burnier 2009a, 396). It is not Burnier's
suggestion that care should replace the values of bureaucracy and the
market, but rather that [public administration should take care as
seriously as it has taken bureaucracy and markets.]{.underline} What
would such a transformation entail? How would a care-centered public
administration look?

Before answering these questions, let me first draw attention to
Burnier's 'interpretative-critical' methodology. It is worth noting that
Burnier arrives at the characteristics of a care-centered public
administration primarily not from a normative ideal image of public
administration but rather from real-life examples (both past and
present) of a certain type of administrative practice. Drawing on
Stivers (2000), Burnier studies the efforts and activities of the
'settlement women' and identifies behind these activities an
"alternative ethos for governance and administrative practice" (Burnier
2009b, 587) which emphasizes relationality , viewing situations from
multiple perspectives, concern for others, cooperative problem-solving,
care and compassion. Although this alternative construction of
administrative reality has never become public administration's dominant
construction---Stivers speaks of "public administration's buried
heritage" (Stivers 2000, 49)---neither has it disappeared. During her
years of teaching public and non-profit administrators in a Master of
Public Administration (MPA) university program, Burnier observed that
"for many public administrators, especially those working at the street
and agency levels, care-centered administration is already at the core
of what they do" (Burnier 2009a, 396). Thus, Burnier argues, if we
carefully listen to the "everyday talk of government employees and
administrators", a fresh discourse might emerge that legitimizes and
illuminates "how care as a value and practice is inextricably tied to
everyday judgments that clients, citizens, and administrators make about
what it means to do a job well or what it means to be a 'good'
administrator" (Burnier 2003, 541). Yet, such an inquiry should not only
be 'interpretative' but should also be 'critical' in the sense of paying
adequate attention to the larger institutional context and its
collective meaning structures (Burnier 2005, 398).Footnote1

[What mainly characterizes a care perspective on public administration
is the belief that administering is a situational and relational
practice which seeks to improve the lives of all individuals and
communities]{.underline} . This further entails several particular
beliefs, such as that (1) good administrative processes and outcomes
should reflect not only expert judgment but a collaborative work that
takes into account different viewpoints and lived experiences; (2) good
administrators should use their discretionary authority not to
accumulate more power but to reach out to the public and invite them to
join a dialogue; (3) good administrative knowledge should be situated in
experience and dialogical reflection; and (4) good administrators should
be critically reflexive, willing to question and challenge their own
values, assumptions and professional judgments.

As noted earlier, [Burnier does not suggest that a care discourse should
be deployed to delegitimize and replace any other normative ground of
public administration]{.underline}. In a care-centered public
administration, [public officials would still be required to apply rules
and deliver public goods and services fairly and equally]{.underline}.
Although public administrators may experience conflicts between
bureaucratic requirements of neutrality and objectivity and care
requirements of cooperative and contextual problem solutions, 'caring
administrators', Burnier argues, would take into consideration both as
they inevitably work under multiple ethical contexts (Burnier 2003,
539--541).[Footnote2 Burnier suggests several practical measures that
could help a government or an institution become more care-centered.
These measures include (1) changing the organizational structure and
culture, (2) deploying relational leadership, (3) introducing formal
recognition and compensation for care work and emotional labor in the
public sector and (4) teaching and training public officials aimed at
acquiring knowledge and skills needed for individuals to become caring
administrators.]{.underline} Unfortunately, Burnier does not say much
about the needed changes concerning the organizational structure and
culture, as her focus is mostly on individual behavior of public
administrators.

As regards the behavior of administrative leaders and managers, Burnier
emphasizes a transformative potential of relational leadership (cf.
Regan and Brooks 1995; Sernak 1998). [The relational leader practices
facilitating and reciprocal power as 'power with' rather than 'power
over'. Such a leader promotes collaboration, caring, courage and vision
within an organization and remains open to the perspectives of
others]{.underline}. The relational leader must "communicate that care
is an organizational value to be embraced and practiced by individuals
throughout the organization" (Burnier 2003, 538). [The emotional labor
and care work of relational leaders as well as other employees go often
unrecognized in public sector agencies. I]{.underline}t is a
marginalized and devalued practice, although it can substantially
contribute to creating better working conditions in an organization and
enhancing the well-being of its clients. Thus, Burnier (2009a) argues,
[we need to introduce measures of formal recognition and compensation
for emotional labor and care work in organizations]{.underline} (such as
alternative modes of evaluation, incorporating this work in job
descriptions and audits etc.). Finally, [governments and public agencies
should bear the responsibility for providing public administrators with
quality education and training aimed at acquiring knowledge and skills
needed for individuals to exercise good administrative discretion and
navigate through the complex web of multiple ethical contexts of
administrative practice.]{.underline}

#### Institutional care must be analyzed through purpose, power, and particularity. That creates effective public ethics and increases interdependency.

Conflict, Power and Bureaucracy in Caring Institutions

Burnier's pioneering work lays the ground for a care-oriented
administrative theory and practice. Yet, it leaves many areas of
research open for further elaboration. Drawing on Fisher and Tronto's
(1990) broad definition of caring and the distinction of four phases of
the care process, Burnier (2003) calls for "the task of explicating the
four phases of care more systematically in the context of public
administration" (Burnier 2003, 541). However, she seems to leave aside
an important element of Fisher and Tronto's analysis, namely their
emphasis on the possibility of conflicts and contradictions arising in
the complex process of caring. It is precisely this element which comes
to the forefront of Tronto's recent interest in institutionalized
caring. "In fact", [Tronto argues, "institutional care is better
understood in the context of conflict. As such, care institutions need
explicit institutional arrangements to help to resolve conflict as it
arises"]{.underline} (Tronto 2010, 168). **[This requires, in Tronto's
view, creating an explicit 'political space within institutions', that
is, "a political process that considers the needs, contributions, and
prospects of many different actors]{.underline}**" (Tronto 2010, 169).

Although Tronto (2010) seems to articulate her account of 'caring
institutions' with respect to institutions and agencies that serve to
directly provide care, I assume, given her broad definition of caring,
that Tronto's characteristics of 'caring institutions' do apply to any
kind of institution through which government implements its policies and
delivers public goods and services.Footnote3 [Tronto approaches the
question of how to assess whether an institution provides good caring
from a perspective of three "critical elements for assessing practices
of care" which grow out of an understanding of care as a relational
practice]{.underline} (Tronto 2010, 161). [All forms of caring, Tronto
argues, "**require that attention be paid to purpose, power, and
particularity "**]{.underline} (Tronto 2010, 161---emphasis added). [It
is true about all forms of caring]{.underline}, but it is especially
true about [the institutional ones]{.underline}, [that they take place
in the contexts of possible conflicts and disagreements about the ends
of care and within unequal power relations.]{.underline} Conflicts and
disagreements often concern the key question of the care process, namely
what are the needs that should be addressed and how best to address
them. [Any institution which suppresses its awareness of existing power
relations (both within and outside the institution), the inevitable
conflicts about the institution's purposes and the disagreements in
needs interpretation will most likely inflict harm to those who are
affected by the institution's agency.]{.underline} Hence, Tronto argues,
in order to be more caring an institution has to raise its awareness of
the three critical elements, "these aspects of care within the
institution need to be worked out consciously ... they ... require a
deliberate, political process" (Tronto 2010, 162; cf. Tronto 2001).

What does this mean in more practical terms? First**[, institutions
should be "highly deliberate and explicit about how to best meet the
needs of the people who they serve]{.underline}**" (Tronto 2010, 169).
They have to find out ways of an active needs interpretation process.
This concerns, Tronto argues, not only the needs of the institution's
clients but needs at multiple levels including the needs of the
employees of the institution: "[care institutions have to think about
the nature of the caring process as a whole in order to guide their
actions. This requirement does not only demand that the 'needs' of the
'customers' come first but also that the needs of care workers, the
allocation of responsibility and proper assessment also happen within
the organization" (]{.underline}Tronto 2010, 162). Yet, an adequate
needs interpretation is a hard task for any institution, since, given
the unequal power relations in institutionalized settings, the needs
expressed by less advantaged people may be easily manipulated or
distorted or simply not heard (Tronto 2010, 164f.).

**[One of the ways to counter the risk of inadequate needs
interpretation is to make the institutions more democratic, inclusive
and responsive so that they "take into consideration the needs and
perspectives of all within the institution"]{.underline}** (Tronto 2010,
168; cf. Tronto 2013, 158--166). Tronto does not say much about the
practical measures that would lead to such a transformation of
institutions. She touches upon the ideas of changing the institutional
culture (cf. Groombridge 2010), of empowering the institution's staff
(cf. Koren 2010), of allocating responsibilities and care work more
fairly and of flattening hierarchies in institutions (Tronto 2010, 165,
168), but she does not suggest what that would entail in terms of
particular changes to the organizational structure, leadership style,
skills and knowledge of employees, consultative mechanisms and so on.
Tronto does not really elaborate on whether different types institutions
at different levels (e.g. local, regional, national) require same or
different changes to become more caring, that is, more responsive,
inclusive and democratic.

I want to conclude this section by taking a closer look at a recent
attempt in theorizing caring institutions that has the potential to
overcome some of the shortcomings of the previous proposals for a theory
of caring institutions and seems particularly promising with respect to
thinking about institutions in the context of public administration. In
[her 'Prolegomena to a Caring Bureaucracy' (2017), Sophie Bourgault
addresses the hard question of whether large bureaucratic institutions
can be conducive to good caring.]{.underline} She seems to be fully
right in claiming that this question is of "utmost importance for
feminist ethics of care" (Bourgault 2017, 203), since, as discussed
earlier, **[any serious attempt to think a 'care politics' has to deal
with care policy formulation and implementation which takes place (also)
through many large institutions of the administrative
state.]{.underline}** Bourgault (2017) counters the mainstream feminist
criticism of bureaucratic organizations by arguing that [(1) the
ideal-bureaucratic (Weberian) emphasis on the criteria of competence in
hiring and promotion, clear division of responsibilities and just
distribution of resources are supportive of many key (care) feminist
aims; (2) removing organizational hierarchies and un-structuring
institutions may sometimes be counterproductive to the (care) feminist
goals of curbing domination and oppression in our societies and
polities.Footnote4 Bourgault's point is that it is possible and fruitful
to think large institutions capable of embodying both bureaucratic and
caring values.]{.underline}

With regard to organizational structure and power allocation within
large institutions, [Bourgault suggests creating semi-hierarchical power
and decision-making structures that combine clear rules and power
divisions with good listening and communicative skills.]{.underline}
Flattening the decision-making processes and structures through hybrid
organizational forms and 'organized dissonance' (Ashcraft 2001) does not
amount to removing all hierarchies and power inequalities within an
institution (cf. Martin 1990, 2013).

Bourgault follows previous care theorizing about institutions by
stressing that institutions need to become more attentive and
responsive. Inspired by Fricker's (2007) reflection on 'epistemic
injustice', Bourgault elsewhere (2020) draws attention to the epistemic
injustices that often occur in institutional contexts, such as
"discursive dysfunctions that regularly take place in our judicial
system, hospitals, schools, workplaces and social service counters" or
public officials' prejudices that "compromise the way in which they
exercise judgement, the way in which they listen (or rather fail to
listen)" (Bourgault 2020, 92, 94). This may, as a consequence, harm the
client's "capacity as an epistemic subject, that is, as a giver of
information and a partner in discursive exchanges" (Bourgault 2020, 94).
Fricker (2007) suggests countering such epistemic injustices by
'virtuous hearing' which incorporates a critical awareness of the impact
that our social power and identities have and an upward compensation of
attention and credibility with respect to marginalized communities and
individuals. Bourgault rightly stresses that above Fricker's suggested
ways of 'virtuous hearing' we also ought to consider a downward
correction of credibility by taking into account "the unduly high levels
of credibility and attention offered to the very privileged or powerful
(that is, credibility excesses)" (Bourgault 2020, 95).

What does(see Emotions) that require from an institution in practical
terms? [A caring institution,]{.underline} Bourgault argues, [should
ensure that it (1) has administrators with solid listening and
communicative skills (personal attentiveness) and (2) puts in place
extensive institutional consultation processes that enable reflective
ways of defining and]{.underline}(see Care; Neoliberalism) [addressing
the needs of all affected groups]{.underline} (institutional
attentiveness). One of the most important questions here is the question
of how to facilitate good administrative discretion. On the one hand,
administrators should be encouraged to exercise discretion; on the other
hand some measures must be in place to ensure that discretion is
exercised "without falling into illegitimate arbitrariness" (Bourgault
2017, 208). [The point is that these measures do not have to be reduced
to adopting more institutional rules and stronger control mechanisms. It
is possible to facilitate good discretion by hiring and promoting
administrators with good communicative and listening skills, providing
administrators with adequate training and support in acquiring needed
cognitive and emotional skills combined with professional expertise and
developing an organizational culture that recognizes and values good
discretion]{.underline}. If an institution seeks to create such a
culture, Bourgault argues, it must also pay adequate attention to the
issue of time, as bad discretion often occurs under the circumstances of
a lack of time. With a special regard to large public sector
institutions we need to "think critically about the impact of neoliberal
management practices and social acceleration, for these weigh heavily on
institutional responsiveness and our ability to offer particularized and
non-prejudicial public services" (Bourgault 2020, 95).

Framing the Question

In recent years, [scholars have made convincing arguments about the need
for robust care policies]{.underline} (Engster

[2001](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259))
and have provided evaluations of the effectiveness of various policies
(Gornick et al.
[2005](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259)).
But [public policies, as well as less formal care practices, all work
through institutions. If we are committed to policies to improve care we
need also to be able to answer the question: how can we tell which
institutions provide good care?]{.underline} A high school teacher told
me that she can tell the quality of a school she has entered within 10
minutes of being in the building. 'How?' I asked. 'Oh', she replied,
'you can just tell which buildings have caring principals and teachers.'
While I am sure that this teacher is correct, those of us without such
tacit knowledge, and, more generally, citizens in a democratic society,
also want to be able to judge whether institutions provide good care. Is
there a way to articulate the basis for such judgments more
systematically? To provide some guidelines is the goal of this essay.

Scholars such as Nel Noddings
([2002](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259))
argue that the best way to think about care institutions is to model
them upon the family. Noddings quotes Lisbeth Schorr to support her
point. Schorr concluded, in reviewing social welfare programs that
benefit children, 'In their responsiveness and willingness to hang in
there, effective programs are more like families than bureaucracies'
(Schorr
[1997](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259),
p. 231). On the contrary[, I shall argue that while we can turn to
family life to intuit some key elements of good care, to provide good
care in an institutional context requires that we make explicit certain
elements of care that go unspoken and that we take for granted in the
family setting.]{.underline}

In recent years, [one response to 'defamilization' of care]{.underline}
(Lewis
[1997](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259))
[has been to turn increasingly to the market.]{.underline} As consumers,
patients, parents, casual observers, we often can and do pass judgments
about the quality of care in various institutional settings. [In
adopting many of the patterns of market life in 'the New Public
Management']{.underline} (Page
[2005](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259)),
[managers in care institutions also have been trying to parse out the
effectiveness of institutionalized care. They use such tools as
measurements of 'customer satisfaction' and the introduction of
competition as ways to assure that public services are being well
provided]{.underline}. Cottage industries provide evaluations of
'patient satisfaction', or 'customer satisfaction', and these
evaluations are justified, especially by their effect on the bottom
line. [A recent survey of patient satisfaction with nursing, for
example, began by noting that as patients become more like consumers,
profits are affected by the quality of the 'patient
satisfaction']{.underline} (Wagner & Bear
[2009](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259)).
Universities struggle to measure teaching effectiveness as well
(Preskill & Russ-Eft
[2005](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259)).
**[But satisfying consumers may not be the same thing as providing care
adequately.]{.underline}** Market assumptions about the consumer---that
she is rational, autonomous, capable of making a choice, and possessed
of adequate information to do so---may not characterize the situation of
people in care settings. In measuring patient satisfaction with nursing,
for example, the questionnaires are only to be filled out by the
patient, not by a family member. Surely, though, family members can
provide insight into the quality of nursing care that might be more or
equally useful to the evaluation by the patient. [Such assumptions
necessarily undermine the prospects for observing and improving care.
Similarly, competition may be useful in goading public service providers
to compete against one another, but it does not establish standards for
care, only that one provider is better than another]{.underline}. If all
are undesirable, **[a market mechanism cannot provide an alternative
unless someone else decides to enter the market]{.underline}**. **[Given
its complexity, low rate of return, and labor-intensive nature of care
provision, market solutions are unlikely to emerge from such
competition. Perhaps, then, the market is not the starting place for
analyzing the adequacy of care.]{.underline}**

Instead of using consumer-like measures of good care, then, I shall
start from the assumptions of those who are skeptical about
institutional care as an alternative to family care. To do so, I shall
make explicit some dimensions of family care that are usually left in
the background. [Families, I shall argue, already make certain
assumptions about the purposes of care, about meeting the particular
needs of individuals, and about the internal allocation of power. In
formal care institutions, however, there may well be conflicting
approaches to purpose, particularity, and power
arrangements.]{.underline} As a result, [care institutions need to have
formal practices in place that will create the space for evaluating and
reviewing how well the institution meets its caring obligations by being
highly explicit about its pursuit of purposes, how it copes with
particularity, and how power is used within the
organization.]{.underline} From this set of initial concerns, we will be
in a better position to evaluate whether care institutions are caring
well.

Changing Institutionalized Contexts for Care

Berenice Fisher and I have described care in general in these terms:

On the most general level, we suggest that caring be viewed as a species
activity that includes everything that we do to maintain, continue, and
repair our 'world' so that we can live in it as well as possible. That
world includes our bodies, our selves, and our environment, all of which
we seek to interweave in a complex, life-sustaining web. (Fisher &
Tronto
[1990](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259),
p. 40; Tronto
[1993](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259),
p. 103)

In the context of institutional care, obviously some care issues are
more relevant than others; self-care, for example, does not usually
happen in institutional contexts. Nevertheless, while institutional
caring is generally provided for the people who Robert Goodin has
described as 'the vulnerable' (Goodin
[1985](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259)),
it is still useful to recall the complex and multi-dimensional nature of
care proposed by Fisher and Tronto. **[By describing four phases of
care---caring about, i.e. recognizing a need for care; caring for, i.e.
taking responsibility to meet that need; care giving, i.e. the actual
physical work of providing care; and, finally, care receiving, i.e. the
evaluation of how well the care provided had met the caring need---we
have highlighted many points where conflict, power relations,
inconsistencies, and competing purposes and divergent ideas about good
care could affect care processes.]{.underline}** We have further argued
that [a care process that was integral and holistic, in which these
phases somehow fit together, approached more closely ideal or good
care]{.underline}. In her research, Fisher discovered that caring often
seems to consist of something 'extra' (Fisher
[1990](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259)).
If caring is the 'extra', then how can we ever discuss it in
institutional terms? It would seem that for institutions to provide
'extra' is already to move it from the status of 'extra' to 'routine'.

In foregrounding care as a kind of human activity, [we followed many
early feminist scholars]{.underline} of care such as Noddings
([1984](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259))
and Ruddick
([1989](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259))
[in emphasizing care as a purposive practice.]{.underline} But as I have
also noted, [care is likely to face two dangers, namely those of
paternalism]{.underline}, in which care givers assume that they know
better than care receivers what those care receivers need, [and
parochialism]{.underline}, in which care givers develop preferences for
care receivers who are closer to them (Tronto
[1993](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259)[).
If we bring these two global, political concerns about caring down to
the level of more concrete caring relationships, then the problems
addressed by caring are the problems of power and
particularity]{.underline}. **[Thus, all forms of caring, institutional
as well as personal, require that attention be paid to purpose, power,
and particularity.]{.underline}** Identifying these three as the
critical elements for assessing practices of care grows out of any
understanding that takes care as a relational practice. Among others,
Christine Koggel
([1998](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259))
and Jennifer Nedelsky
([2008](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259))
have insisted that we recognize caring as relational.

In part because most people\'s explicit experiences of being in care
relationships are rooted in the family, we often take family care as
paradigmatic of all care relations. [The current phenomenon of shifting
care from household to market, state, or non-profit organization is a
shift in the kind of institutionalized care, because the family, though
it often appears 'natural', is also a social institution with a
particular history and structure.]{.underline} In recent years, feminist
explorations of the nature of the family and care within it have made
clear that all such arrangements are deeply embedded in their own times
and places (Hays
[1996](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259);
Ruddick
[1995](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259)).

But is it still useful to think about this mythic family? What is it
that makes family care so desirable? In the first instance, family care
seems somewhat automatic. No one questions seriously the purpose of
family care: helping the members of the family to flourish together and,
often in our culture, as individuals. In the second instance, while this
care appears to be automatic, in fact, family care rests upon clearly
understood lines of power and obligation: children and parents, spouses,
aunts and uncles, servants, know what they owe to one another. In the
third instance, family care is highly particularistic: each family
evolves its own ways of doing certain things, and part of the pleasure
in being cared for by someone in one\'s own family is that the family
member is likely to understand and act to accommodate those
peculiarities.

The family was not always such a paradise, but it was the realm where
most caring work was done. We should not be too nostalgic for the
family, however. While changes in care through the growth of public
institutions correspond to the diminishment of the family as the primary
institution of care, these changes are also tied to many other changes
in the nature of modern life. Until professional health structures grew,
for example, people expected to live and die in their homes. Until
antibiotics, death was often caused by fast-moving infections as well as
by long-term chronic illness. Until recently, children of all but the
most privileged classes were expected not to be educated but to become
workers and often at a very early age. The field, mine, or work-house
served as day care and schools. Whether these earlier modes are more
desirable is not such an easy question.

Leaving aside our sentimental views of the family, though, the challenge
is whether more public social institutions can be similarly arranged so
that they provide the same elements of care that the family ideally
provided. I will suggest that the same three elements can be present,
but not in the same way. While the beauty of relationships in the
mythic, glorified family was that they did not need discussion, they
evolved out of the ongoing interactions among the personalities in the
household. Thus, they could be taken for granted. In any other
institution these aspects of care within the institution need to be
worked out consciously. This does not make these elements less
achievable, but it does mean that they become more visible and require a
deliberate, political process to enact them. These three elements, then,
are: first, a clear account of power in the care relationship and thus a
recognition of the need for a politics of care at every level; second, a
way for care to remain particularistic and pluralistic; and third, that
care should have clear, defined, acceptable purposes.

[As we think about institutional settings for care, we rarely invoke
similar language about purposefulness or about power and
particularity]{.underline}. **[As managerial experts have often advised,
organizations that focus on the outcome of their work, rather than their
profits, often work better]{.underline}**. As Richard Ellsworth puts the
point: 'A clearly articulated and properly formulated purpose---one that
members of the organization understand and value---provides continuity
and constancy while placing the need to adapt to changing customer needs
at the heart of the company\'s shared values' (Ellsworth
[2002](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259),
p. 5). At a second level, if we think about this idea in terms of care,
we might reformulate it: **[care institutions have to think about the
nature of the caring process as a whole in order to guide their
actions]{.underline}**. [This requirement does not only demand that the
'needs' of the 'customers' come first but also that the needs of care
workers, the allocation of responsibility and proper assessment also
happen within the organization]{.underline}.

Indeed, [thinking about the organization\'s purpose quickly requires us
to notice the complexity of care, and that of all those people involved
in the organization of care]{.underline}. Even Ellsworth\'s facile
formulation of the requisites for 'leading with purpose' disclose that
there has to have been a lengthy process by which the members of the
organization have come to understand their common purpose and how best
to act upon it. Thus, [**to imagine a world organized to care well
requires that we focus on three things: politics: recognition and
debate/dialogue of relations of power within and outside the
organization** of competitive and dominative power and agreement of
common purpose; particularity and plurality: attention to human
activities as particular and admitting of other possible ways of doing
them and to diverse humans having diverse preferences about how needs
might be met; and purposiveness: awareness and discussion of the ends
and purposes of care. If we keep these aspects of care in mind then **we
will be able to determine how to think through institutions using the
'logics of care'**]{.underline} (Waerness
[1984a](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17496535.2010.484259)

[that they require.]{.underline}

### Solvency---Gender 

#### A public model of care redistributes the responsibility of care between the private and public spheres and creates new political foundations based on interdependence that forward gender equity.

**Udhe 18 -- **Researcher in the Department of Gender & Sociology at the
Czech Academy of Sciences Institute of Sociology. \[Zuzana. "Caring
Revolutionary Transformation: The Combined Effects of a Universal Basic
Income and a Public Model of Care." Basic Income Studies, vol 13, no 2
(2018). Dec 13, 2018.\]

I suggest that **[a public model of care allows for a redistribution of
the responsibility of care between the private and public sphere and
secures access to care on a solidary basis according to
needs]{.underline}** (i. e. it transforms the institutional context of
the gendered division of labour). [An unconditional basic income, on the
other hand, transforms the material implications of the gendered
division of labour by separating financial security and income from paid
employment,]{.underline} disrupting the centrality of work in paid
employment and allowing for a redefinition of the principle of merit.
**[The combination of these two effects -- changing the institutional
context along with the implications of the gendered division of labour
-- can foster deeper changes in gendered relations and the recognition
of caring activities]{.underline}**.

[I understand a public model of care as a social organisation of care
based on intersubjective ontology\[11\] and a shared social
responsibility for care]{.underline}. [It is built on a **developed
public provision for a variety of day care facilities**]{.underline}
(e. g. for children, the sick, elderly, or disabled), [public assistance
and other services that socialise care]{.underline} and certain
housework but ultimately it also **[includes public health care,
education and after-schooling activities]{.underline}**. The concrete
realisation of a public model of care can take multiple forms. [Care
institutions can be collectively-owned and participatory institutions,
state, city or non-profit institutions, voluntary community care, or
public home assistance]{.underline} (i. e. care workers are public
employees). [While it is based on shared social responsibility for care,
it also needs to protect the intimate sphere which is an important place
for well-being and preservation of individual integrity]{.underline}
(Young, 2005b). Public institutions are to support and supplement
familial care**[. Socializing reproductive work and care is an
expression of recognition of interdependence and interpenetration of the
private and public spheres.]{.underline}** [What is important is the
distinction of a public model of care from a traditional model of care
and a market model of care]{.underline}. A [traditional model of care is
based primarily on familial responsibility for care and is heavily
dependent on women´s unpaid work]{.underline} which can be supported
through care and family allowances. In [a market model of care families
and those in need of care buy care services on the market]{.underline}.
(I will focus on shortcomings of a market model of care later in this
paper) Publically financed care institutions were to some extent
established in real socialist countries and European welfare states,
although not entirely without problems. However, together with the
dismantling of the welfare state which became a dominant trend since the
1990s, these public provisions are being shifted to the market or back
to families (Gilbert, 2002).

**[A public model of care redistributes the responsibility of care
between the private and public spheres]{.underline}**. The goal is not a
complete removal of care from the family but [an establishment of a
variety of institutions which share along with the family social
reproductive work and care.]{.underline} [A public model of care
challenges the illusory norm of an independent, able-bodied, socially
isolated individual without care responsibilities]{.underline}. It
[shifts the focus of the responsibility of care away from the family as
in a traditional model of care towards a principle of
solidarity]{.underline}; in contrast to a market model of care, [it also
takes into account the care needs of the lower social classes and
marginalised groups.]{.underline} Although a public model of care does
not do away with the traditional gendered division of labour, [it
transforms the societal context by challenging the strict separation
between the private and public sphere]{.underline}.

However, because a public model of care does not question the priority
of labour market participation, often the provision of childcare or
eldercare facilities is framed as a means to increase women´s engagement
in paid employment. As such, it creates a double workload for women, as
they largely continue to do most of the work within the household
despite holding down a paid job. Furthermore, since a public model of
care does not lead to a transformation of the current labour market, it
fails to address the problem that for some groups of women, paid
employment is neither emancipating nor a source of self-realisation --
something which they could, in contrast, experience with caregiving. To
sum up, a public model of care fails to question the undervaluation of
care stemming from the limited understanding of meaningful work as paid
employment. If we want to support women's emancipation and gender equity
in society, it is simply not enough to dust off post-war ideas of the
welfare state and public care facilities[; we also need to problematise
the one-sided, limited understanding of work as paid employment which is
attached to a limited notion of social recognition.]{.underline}

[An unconditional basic income challenges this wagework bias by
separating financial income from paid employment.]{.underline} Today,
the trends towards workfare have further reinforced the negative aspects
of the post-war version of welfare state social benefits (e. g.
unemployment benefits, pensions, social security) that are contingent on
labour market participation (Gilbert, 2002). Shortcomings of this
approach are even highlighted by the changing characteristics of the
labour market, which lead to increase of job insecurities, the growth of
work in the informal sector, "negative flexibilisation" and
intensification of work, and overall precarization (Beck, 2000;
Standing, 2011).

[An unconditional basic income provides a sum of money to everyone
within a certain political community without additional conditions and
without the often humiliating procedures of applying for and reviewing
such payments.]{.underline} A UBI can be understood as a share of
society's wealth, the result of social and technological long-term
development. [The entitlement to a UBI is individual,
unconditional]{.underline} (although in some proposals it is limited to
the legal age of adulthood), [universal]{.underline} (although it
depends on the definition of a political community and, in some
proposals, it is limited to citizens, which obviously limits its
universality), and in order to realise its potential, the amount should
be sufficiently high to meet basic social needs\[12\] (Da Silva, 2014;
Gorz, 1999; Van Parijs, 2000).

A UBI introduces an unconditional financial payment which allows for a
transformation of the way we perceive the principle of merit. This could
be an indirect effect of an unconditionality of a UBI because to merit
financial reward one does not need to work in paid employment. If one
would not have to have paid employment in order to have the financial
means to live a decent life, it would also open to transformation the
work-centred ethos of late capitalist society. Furthermore, [a UBI
separates financial income and security from wagework without the
stigmatisation recipients of social support are subjected
to]{.underline}; it is without the social disregard which has a strong
negative psychological effect on both the unemployed and, for example,
parents who receive parental allowances (mainly women[). It can provide
those caring for dependent members of society with dignity and divest
them of the label of spongers who get something for
nothing]{.underline}. **[It can also secure them with a certain level of
independence, whether from their husband or partner, their employer or
bureaucracy]{.underline}**. For a UBI to have a maximum gendered effect
it is important that it is paid also to children (in full or reduced
amount) which would provide an adequate financial security also to
solo-parent families. Last but not least, a UBI eliminates the risk of
poverty in old age, which has also a gendered dimension because of the
gender pension gap. Philippe Van Parijs convincingly shows that the
above mentioned arguments support a UBI (Van Parijs, 2000; Zelleke,
2011). [While a UBI does not directly provide recognition to care, it
weakens the misconception that socially beneficial activities which
"merit" financial reward are only those activities undertaken through
paid employment]{.underline}. This misconception is deeply rooted in the
structures of our society (Weeks, 2011) and it principally does not
allow for recognition of care. It is for this reason that the current
gendered division of labour leads to a gender wage gap, gender pension
gap, gender power hierarchy in the family and also in society, and to a
diminished self-esteem that many women who devote much of their time to
care experience. Although a UBI cannot alone transform the gendered
structures of the division of labour, it can change its significance and
material implications of this division by eliminating poverty and the
economic dependency of women and by eroding the wagework bias.

Nevertheless, a stream of feminist thought opposing a UBI stresses that
gendered inequality associated with the division of leisure time and the
opportunities for self-fulfilment could still linger even after the
implementation of a UBI. As such, men could break away from the
existential necessity of paid full-time or unattractive employment in
favour of their preferred activities, while most women would do the same
in favour of caring for others which, while some might prefer this,
others might not (Gheaus, 2008; Robeyns, 2001). On the other hand,
without the pressures of financial necessity where many couples
eventually adopt a traditional male breadwinner and female caregiver
model, such a change could potentially open the doors to redefining a
traditional model that does not necessarily express people´s choice but
rather their adaptation to external circumstances. A UBI would allow
egalitarian couples to implement their ideas on shared childcare,
whereas today they face institutional barriers in the form of, for
example, lower women's pay or time-demanding employment, a barrier
further enhanced when a family is dependent on just one income (i. e.
fathers of young children typically work longer hours). In these
partnerships, a UBI would allow for a change in the gendered division of
labour, which could spread to other social strata and groups (Elgarte,
2008).

At the same time, however, [a UBI could also lead to a more significant
transformation of the labour market because it provides people with the
opportunity of choosing employment or having the option to not work
during certain phases of life, thus, contributing to
institutionalization of an interrupted career path as the universal
norm]{.underline}. This aspect is not sufficiently considered within the
feminist critique of a UBI (Bergmann, 2008; Gheaus, 2008; Orloff, 2013).
If everyone had a guaranteed basic income, they would likely change
their life plans. Their main purpose would not simply be to earn enough
money to pay for rent, food, clothes and to provide for their children.
[Their principal priority rather would be doing what they actually want
to do or figuring out how they could benefit their
community]{.underline}. Today, it is mainly women who practice an
interrupted career path, interrupting their paid employment for a period
of caregiving. Because the "male" uninterrupted career path is
considered the norm, women are discriminated against in the labour
market. If instead an interrupted career path became the norm, this
would open the doors to the institutionalisation of the universal
caregiver model as discussed by Nancy Fraser (cf. McLean et al., 2015).
Moreover, a UBI may also bring about wage rise in those jobs which are
necessary for sustainability of a society but are not adequately valued
by the market, including care work. When people are not forced to accept
any kind of job, these socially indispensable jobs would need to be
better remunerated in order to attract employees. However, this requires
that people without citizenship of the country where they reside are
also granted a UBI, otherwise migrants would constitute a cheap labour
force and the mentioned potential effect on the labour market would not
be realized.

[In order to realise the potential of a UBI, I suggest that we need to
elaborate its foundations in intersubjective ontology.]{.underline} How
a concrete policy is implemented depends on its foundations. Seemingly
the same policies may have very different outcomes depending on the
ontological foundations which direct a policy´s justification and a way
of implementation. One of the leading contemporary proponents of a UBI,
Philippe Van Parijs, interprets a UBI from the perspective of a
left-libertarian position which he calls real-libertarianism (Van
Parijs, 1995). A UBI is an institutional proposal for the realisation of
the egalitarian libertarian concept of justice based on two basic
tenets. First, real freedom is dependent on ownership of resources, and
equal opportunity requires redistribution of a certain basic level of
material provision. Secondly, real freedom of the individual presupposes
the basic right to self-ownership, so that people are not coerced or
required to provide certain services or activities to others.\[13\]
Specifically, Van Parijs seeks through his UBI proposal to ensure real
freedom for all and reassess the prevailing paradigm of paid work as the
primary socially valued activity. He argues that it does not reflect
current developments, where stable paid employment is becoming a scarce
resource and the idea of full employment has proven to be unfeasible.
Van Parijs explicitly supports the demands of the feminist movement as
an argument in support of implementing a UBI. He claims that a UBI aims
to overcome deficiencies in current social systems which derive social
security from participation in the labour market, and, thus, to a
certain extent, restrict the access of unemployed persons to social
security, while also stigmatising the recipients of social welfare
benefits.\[14\]

When it comes to both of these aspects, women are clearly at a
disadvantage when compared to men due to the gendered division of
labour. First, they are entitled merely to lower social security
payments because of lower earnings. Secondly, due to the current
division of responsibilities in terms of care for dependent members of
society, women are receivers of social welfare benefits to a greater
extent and thus are a target of stigmatisation. From the feminist
perspective, however[, the fundamental deficiency of this
conceptualisation of a UBI is its atomist ontology and the second tenet
of the definition of justice on which real-libertarian proposition is
based.]{.underline} Real-libertarian conceptualisation of self-ownership
as a consequence establishes the socially unattached individual as a
socially valued norm[. It puts forward a distorted idea of isolated
person without caring responsibilities and fully developed social
relations of mutual recognition among people]{.underline} (see Anderson,
2013). Nevertheless, rejecting atomist ontology does not imply rejecting
an individual approach to the definition of the subject of
justice.\[15\] While the financial payment provided with a UBI is not
conditioned on performing any duties, this justification does not
require an atomist ontological position. [The UBI based on
intersubjective ontology can be justified as a realization of the right
of people to a share of collectively owned social and natural resources
which provides individuals with financial resources necessary (but not
sufficient) to live their lives in intersubjective relations with
others.\[]{.underline}16\]

The factor which most disadvantages women in contemporary (Western)
society remains the gendered division of labour, a factor related to
providing for the needs of dependent members of society (e. g. children,
elderly, disabled, etc.). **[As such, in order to achieve gender equity,
we need to rethink our ideal of autonomous self.]{.underline}**
Individual existence is always conditioned by mutual interdependency
between members of society. [We are all situated in interdependent
relations with others which are, however, materialized differently in
different relations ranging from the intimate to the
impersonal.]{.underline} Feminist theorists have reformulated the ideal
of individual autonomy as a relational concept (Held, 2006; Tronto,
1994; Young, 2000). The concept of relational autonomy is based on
intersubjective ontology and comes from the presupposition that
realising an individual project requires others; this does not imply
non-intervention from other parties, but rather support from other
parties with whom we are in relations of mutual interdependence, both
material and psychosocial. Iris Young suggests that

the social constitutions of agents and their acting in relations of
interdependence mean that the ability to separate and be independent of
others is rare if it appears at all. ... \[The relational autonomy\]
entails recognizing that agents are related in many ways they have not
chosen, by virtue of kinship, history, proximity, or unintended
consequences of action. (Young, 2000, p. 231)

For example those who have paid employment are also dependent on others
-- employers, co-workers and those who look after them or allow them to
opt out of their caregiving obligations.\[17\]

Given the increasing global interactions, [the idea of relational
autonomy implies also the need to take into account mutual
interdependency of all people as citizens of a global
society]{.underline}. This reformulation appears particularly
fundamental because of global interconnectedness of people and social
processes and the transferring of care work to migrant women. Defining a
political community whose members are to be entitled to a UBI is also
important in this regard. Provided that entitlement to a UBI would be
based on political citizenship, a further deepening of social inequality
between people on the basis of their origin would ensue. In this regard,
it would be better to consider linking a UBI to residence within a
particular territory, while ensuring border permeability, or,
alternatively, the global implementation of a UBI. This issue is also
voiced by O´Reilly who points out that often the proposal of a UBI
excludes migrants by equating entitlement criteria with citizenship
(O´Reilly, 2008).

Van Parijs argues that in regard to the feminist criticism of inequality
between men and women, the strictly individual foundation upon which a
UBI is based, allows women to realise their own freedom to a much
greater extent than within a system that redistributes social welfare
benefits at the household level and where the same power hierarchy which
is institutionalized at a macro-social level is applied and leads to an
unequal division of income within the household, much to the detriment
of women (Van Parijs, 2000). Nevertheless, the adherence to atomist
ontology helps to legitimize this unequal power hierarchy in the public
and private spheres and even when women have unconditional basic income
there are other forms of inequalities at the household level connected
to the gendered division of labour and responsibilities for care, such
as division of leisure time and the opportunities for self-fulfilment.
If a UBI is based on atomist ontology, implementation of any
supplementing policies is contingent, depending on a given ideological
constellation of power. That´s why Taylor argues that an ontological
basis is not innocent. A UBI may be based on an individual approach when
defining the subject of justice, but if it is to contribute to gender
equity, then the atomist concept of social ontology on which Van
Parijs's proposal of a UBI is based, must be redefined.

In order for implementation of a UBI to support gender equity, [it must
be accompanied by a change in the social norms which one-sidedly favour
the model of an independent socially disembedded citizen over the model
of a citizen positioned within relations of mutual recognition and
dependence on others]{.underline}. Without this qualitative change, a
UBI could instead result in the deepening of inequalities between men
and women, the healthy and sick, etc. As such, [a UBI needs to be
accompanied by developing a public model of care which can secure
accessible and high-quality childcare and nursery schools, care homes
and public assistance for the elderly, the sick or disabled, health care
for the sick]{.underline}. In this combination **[it can start the path
of caring revolutionary transformation resulting in deep systemic
changes through challenging the logic of today´s socioeconomic
system.\[]{.underline}**18\] In another form, assuming the dismantling
of certain elements of a solidary society, a UBI would not result in an
emancipatory effect.\[19\] Although it is possible to revoke certain
social welfare benefits (depending on the amount of a UBI), the state
should not transfer to the market the cornerstones of solidary society.

### Solvency---Individuation

#### Reframing the politics of care opens up new political formations based on horizontal relationships of equity and mutuality.

Care and the commons

In recent years, t**[here has been a renewed interest in care, one
grounded in the belief that care can be retooled to address persistent
forms of exclusion and domination]{.underline}**. [There are many
animating forces for this reclaiming of 'care' as a
concept,]{.underline} including new forms of need resulting [from
austerity and anti-immigration policies, ultra-right-wing forms of
abandonment, and, most recently the world-changing COVID-19 pandemic and
the deep racial stratification and violence it has
revealed.]{.underline}

[These kinds of care work to counter dominant liberal forms of political
care, such as welfare or humanitarianism which have been imagined and
enacted at the level of the nation-state, or of humanity, relying on
exclusionary political frameworks]{.underline}. Welfare excludes
non-citizens; as for humanitarianism, not all qualify as equally human.
Furthermore, [such forms of liberal care are driven by limited moral
sentiments such as sympathy, pity, or compassion, which create
hierarchies by distinguishing between deserving and undeserving
individuals]{.underline}; indeed, they have worked in large part by
saving those deemed 'innocent' but in so doing, they criminalize
'perpetrators' (Ticktin, 2011, 2017, 2020). [In this sense, practices of
care have (unintentionally) fed the carceral state, deciding whose lives
deserve attention and whose do not.]{.underline}

[In the contemporary, reworked versions, care is at once an affective
state, a practice, and an ethicopolitical obligation]{.underline}
(Tronto, 1993; Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017; Martin, Myers, and Viseu,
2015; Stevenson, 2014). Increasingly scholars, anti-racist activists and
Black and transnational feminists are reclaiming the power of care, as
everyday and mundane, but with a revolutionary, transformative
potential. People are returning to Audre Lorde (1988), who stated that,
for those who are marginalized, care is a form of political warfare: to
engage in care is to uphold the right to survive. Similarly, Saidiya
Hartmann (2016) argues that the labor of care produced through the
violent structures of slavery and subsequently exploited by racial
capitalism is not exhausted by either of these violent formations: this
care enables those who were never meant to survive to do just that, even
in the most brutal of contexts.

[While I have long critiqued forms of care such as
humanitarianism]{.underline} (Ticktin, 2006, 2011**[), I join this
interest in renewed and emerging forms of materially grounded care,
insofar as they are co-constitutive of a new set of political
formations]{.underline}** -- what I'm calling [a decolonial, feminist
commons.]{.underline} That is, [**there is a version of care at the
heart of the commons, insofar as the commons are about radical resource
redistribution and undoing forms of domination and enclosure to produce
horizontal relationships of equality, mutuality and responsibility**.
Care is one of the methods used to imagine, prefigure and enact
alternative ways of being together in a fundamentally non-exclusionary,
non-sentimental manner]{.underline}. Indeed, we might say that, by
enacting what Woodly (2020) calls '**[structural care]{.underline}**,'
which [is about healing social ills through social action based on a
vision of everyone as interdependent, **new political formations come
into being**; care helps to bring a new collective subject into
being]{.underline}. In this contribution, I introduce the idea of the
commons, and then illustrate these emergent political formations with
two case studies.

The commons has come to mean many things (and is practiced by many
different people, from indigenous communities to Black and Brown
communities, to ecologists to anarchists), but it is often referred to
as a struggle against enclosures, the privatization of spaces of
freedom, exclusion, and, perhaps most importantly, private property. It
can also mean the sharing of wealth and resources on the basis of
collective decision-making; sometimes it is spoken of as grounded in
social relations built on reciprocity, respect, mutuality, and
responsibility (Hardt and Negri, 2009; Starblanket, 2017; Dardot and
Laval, 2019; Federici, 2019).

Feminist scholar-activists like Silvia Federici (2019) emphasize the
feminist nature of the commons in terms of the communing of reproductive
activities -- meaning the day-to-day activities that are producing
people's lives. Examples include the collective kitchen, urban gardens,
and squats. Federici states that [the commons is not just a site of
reproduction and redistribution: it is also a site of struggle. It
builds the grounds of resistance, refusing to **separate the time of
political organization** from that of reproduction]{.underline}.
Abolitionist politics arguably offers the strongest example of this,
insisting on the interconnection between carework and political
organizing, where, for example, mothers of those who are incarcerated
model collective ways of being by taking responsibility for each other's
children, and extend their care to friends, neighbors and cell mates
(Naber et al 2020). In this sense, [the commons is also necessarily
anti-racist and decolonial.]{.underline}

Black and Brown activists and scholars have reassured those who worry
that the goal of equivalence in a (future) commons would erase or ignore
existing differences in power; instead, [young scholars]{.underline}
like Maimuna Touray (2021) actually [suggest that the commons could work
as a method of reparation]{.underline}, while queer theorist José
Estaban Muñoz (2020) argues for the 'brown commons' as a process of
thinking and imagining otherwise in the face of shared wounding (p. 6).
Touray envisions the commons as a set of connections to the land shared
with indigenous communities that extend a notion of value anathema to
capitalist enclosures and center responsibility, care and radical
belonging. Believing that settler colonialism is a structure, not an
event, Touray proposes the commons as a form of reparation beyond
restitution or one-time payments, insofar as it expands a way of living
in which enslaved people shared knowledge and decided collectively how
to prioritize their well-being. After centuries of caring for and
stewarding the land, commoning involves being claimed by the land,
recognizing human interdependence with other life forms and with the
earth. It 'places the human in common with other-than-human-beings'
(Touray, 2021).

In this context[, care is about a set of relational arrangements, not
moral dispositions; it is grounded in the material. It is also
necessarily non-innocent]{.underline}. That is, it moves away from
liberal goals of purity and deservingness. **[To care requires admitting
to and managing forms of violence, not trying to evict, expunge or expel
it]{.underline}**. Caring and killing can be intertwined: for example,
people kill viruses; they eat plants and animals; and they burn forests
to maintain them. As Métis-scholar-activist Michelle Murphy (2015)
suggests, one of the definitions of care that is often overlooked is
that of being troubled, worried, uneasy, unsettled. In this sense, to
care in unsettling ways, and to be unsettled by care, means to work
without a clear, normative vision, requiring instead to be attuned to
relationships and to place, constantly improvising. [Care is not
necessarily clean; to care is to be creative, to be willing to imagine
otherwise, to deal with messiness and contamination. Indeed,
'unsettling' means that it has radical transformative
potential.]{.underline}

In what follows, I briefly mention [two emergent forms of structural
care that build, and build on, an idea of the commons.]{.underline} To
be clear, to exist, the commons needs, as Harris argues in this
exchange, to undo the world as we know it, and its inequalities and
forms of domination; but [it is important to acknowledge that commoning
already exists all around us, if we look carefully -- it grows in the
uncaptured excesses of racial capitalism, and prefigures alternative
ways of being]{.underline}. I describe two of these extant experiments,
each taking place at a different scale: the first is global -- for this,
I discuss 'no borders' movements; the second is local, and here I
discuss practices of mutual aid. They each have their own affective
dimensions. And each does different work with relation to the commons:
[the first helps to form a common collective political subject and to
rework space, the second furthers material redistribution.]{.underline}

[I begin with the political forms being imagined and enacted by
undocumented immigrants -- renamed 'people-on-the-move' by these folks
themselves, to get away from legal categories built on exclusion and
hierarchy,]{.underline} like refugee, asylum seeker and economic
immigrant -- and the centrality of care to many of these movements.
Indeed, one of the activists engaged in sanctuary work -- which I see as
part of a larger network of no-borders movements -- stated that she
thought of the project of sanctuary as the 'embodied, collective action
of care,' where care is about spurring the imagination, and 'training
for the not-yet.'

Occupations are a key aspect of this embryonic politics of and by
people-on-the-move: occupations of abandoned buildings and land. People
are not just fighting for the freedom to move but the 'freedom to
inhabit' (Paik et al., 2019, p.10). In particular, I have been drawn by
people-on-the-move attempting to create space to live, in ways not
condoned by forms of liberal capitalist governance.

I am aware of how troubling the term 'occupation' is, particularly in
relation to settler colonialism. The question is if such acts can be
repurposed toward freedom; that is, if no-borders movements can practice
decolonial politics, working with indigenous communities against the
nation-state to undo rather than further the settler colonial project
(Fortier, 2017). The point is not to imagine or claim the land as empty
or available, but precisely to refuse the authority of the state,
challenging its right to decide who resides where. But even when evoked
against the settler colonial project, the concept of occupation recalls
violent histories. In this sense, commoning is necessarily a
non-innocent practice -- we all inherit and live in the wake of these
histories, we are all shaped by violence, even if we are differently
situated in relation to it. To claim innocence is a liberal aspiration;
it is not a goal of the commons, where exclusion based on moral
stratification is not an option.

People-on-the-move are re-imagining both space and how to be together,
asserting their presence against experiences of dispossession and
inequality, and doing so beyond judgments of deserving or undeserving,
rescue and protection: beyond innocence or guilt. [They are building
alternative forms of governance against the state and against what they
see as unjust treatment, including the lack of basic care and shelter.
They do this by occupying liminal spaces, challenging regimes of private
property.]{.underline} Togetherness is grounded on sharing resources, in
ways that require reciprocity and mutuality, but not necessarily love --
this is a form of care or concern that does not require liking those
with whom one lives. It requires inclusion and respect. Whoever needs a
home -- and for however long -- can occupy any welcoming, unlived in or
abandoned space. These include border zones, hotels, monuments and
churches. In many ways, these occupations are forcing a more equitable
distribution of resources, and as part of this, they include the refusal
of discourses and hierarchies of moral deservingness.

Occupations have taken different forms, from the now famous French sans
papiers movement of the 1990s which occupied churches, to 'the Jungle'
-- the make-shift camp on the outskirts of Calais, France that lasted
from January 2015 to October 2016 (Agier, 2018; King, 2019). But France
is not the only place where such occupations are occurring. In the
summer of 2018, as part of the Multiple Mobilities Research Cluster, I
went to the occupied Plaza Hotel in Athens, Greece, one of about twelve
occupied buildings which, under the new right-wing government, has now
been shut down. Plaza is an example of the autonomous organization of
people-on-the-move, without an NGO working top-down to manage them or
provide services. These occupations originated in the dissident history
of the district of Exarcheia, where abandoned buildings have been the
site of collective living and action since the 1970s. 'Refugees' and
locals worked and occupied the hotel together. Rather than being
contained on the margins of the Greek polity, as with so many refugee
camps, these people-on-the-move live in Athens, indistinguishable from
the many who require shelter, particularly since Greece's debt crisis.
They were all houseless, out-of-place, and as such, they reclaimed space
together.

Plaza challenged liberal models of care. For example, Plaza residents
worked to enable children to go to school regardless of how long they
would be in Athens, decoupling social services from nation-states --
indeed, as one of the Plaza residents explained to me, the local
teachers organized and went on strike to enable this. This was an
experiment in how social services can be accessible to people beyond
citizenship status or the state, beyond identity, as part of a larger
commons, driven by participation, presence and mutuality.

In these circumstances, [care is enacted by creating and sharing spaces
to live, in a non-exclusionary manner; it manifests in other material
concerns such as creating access to healthcare and
education.]{.underline} In Plaza, there were communal kitchens, so
people could prepare food and eat as a collective. Practices of care
like these work to even out hierarchies, and create a world where people
all have access to resources to live. This does not mean that such
occupations work without violence or conflict. Rather, [violence is
something that people inevitably share from living under racial
capitalism and imperialism]{.underline}. **[The idea is to learn to use
an attuned, caring manner to resolve issues, rather than resorting to
strategies like incarceration or expulsion.]{.underline}** Starting from
a situation of enforced marginalization and dispossession, people-on-the
move and those in solidarity have created a series of transnational,
commoning nodes -- an emergent feminist decolonial commons -- grounded
on forms of radical care, respect and collective self-governance; in the
process, they are prefiguring a new collective political subject.

[My second example is an experiment in reworking material
infrastructures to deepen connections between people at more local
levels.]{.underline} [This is the project of free community or
'friendly' fridges set up across all the boroughs of New York
City]{.underline}. The first refrigerators were put in place in February
2020 by a group of anarchists working to combat hunger in underserved
communities during the economic crisis and pandemic, but they have far
exceeded that goal: they are resources that anyone can share in,
anonymously, without giving reasons or showing deservingness. They trust
people to take what they need and give back if they can. [It creates a
new set of relations grounded in material equality, not in exploitation
and extractivism]{.underline} (Colyar, 2020; Rosa, 2020).

These fridges prefigure forms of politics grounded on the idea of care
as simply about need and survival, not on a notion of 'community' that
foregrounds only positive -- and often exclusionary -- affective ties.
Even as they help to imagine an otherwise, these fridges build on the
long and colorful histories of mutual aid, which are based on the idea
of social solidarity and cooperation, and build new social relationships
grounded in collaboration, participation, and equality (Spade, 2020a,
b). [Mutual aid is about radical collective care and it is feminist in
that it works against forms of paternalism or top-down
giving]{.underline}. Even as Indigenous communities may have the longest
history of such practices, many Black feminists have claimed mutual aid
as a key element of abolitionism. [The care embedded in this project is
about respect and reciprocity; resources are shared, regardless of who
one is, what one does, and how one inhabits the world.]{.underline}

To be sure, just as mutual aid is not new, neither are 'free' projects:
we need only think of the Black Panther Party's survival programs, which
included free breakfast, or Occupy encampments where resources were
shared. There are many creative feminist examples, such as the 'Eating
in Public' project by Gaye Chan and Nandita Sharma, which started with
free stores and expanded to include fridges, as one part of a series of
experiments in planting guerilla gardens, food trees, eating and
teaching about weeds and holding 'diggers dinners,' all inspired by the
seventeenth-century English commoners: serfs who were pushed off
communal land at the outset of the private-property revolution, who
engaged in activist planting to take back their commons and to eat
(Ganaden, 2014). [They distinguish their experiments from charity
insofar as the free store and fridge are for everyone: rich and poor
alike.]{.underline}

**[The affective ties cultivated by these forms of commoning are less
about individuality than the collective, more about equality than
hierarchy]{.underline}**. Togetherness is about co-existing in ways that
ensure everyone's survival. '[Care' in these times looks like respect
for everyone's fear, anxiety, anger, and frustration. It looks like
humility in the face of the unknown and uncontrollable, and openness to
new imaginative possibilities]{.underline}. It also looks like a demand
for collective responsibility, and what M4BL among others have
prefigured as an 'irresistible impulse to justice' (McLeod, 2019, p.
267).

### Solvency---Liberal Subjectivity

#### Re-engagement with care as a political praxis creates new ways of living and governing beyond the traditional liberal approach.

[Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, discussions about the
politics of care have proliferated within and beyond the
academy]{.underline}. This welcome attention to care demands we revisit
care in the context of ongoing and new forms of state violence. **[The
present moment invites a re-engagement with care as a political theory,
an ethic and a political praxis that reorients people toward new ways of
living, relating, and governing.]{.underline}** The 21st-century
approach to [the politics of care aims at unmaking racial capitalism,
cisheteropatriarchy, the carceral state, and the colonial
present]{.underline}. **[The politics of care]{.underline}** is an
approach to political thought and action that **[moves beyond the
liberal approach which situates care as a finite resource to be
distributed among autonomous individuals,]{.underline}** or as a
necessarily feminine virtue. Instead, [those elucidating the politics of
care for the contemporary era draw on rich interdisciplinary traditions
and social movements to theorize and practice care as an **inherently
interdependent survival strategy, a foundation for political organizing,
and a prefigurative politics for building a world in which all people
can live and thrive.**]{.underline}

The political theoretic genealogies that the authors of this exchange
draw from include Black Feminisms, Indigenous and Decolonial Feminisms,
and Social Reproduction Theory. These contributions argue that [a
politics of care seeks not only to exceed 20th century liberal
frameworks but also to elaborate an abolitionist orientation that is
capable of diagnosing, undoing, and building new political
horizons]{.underline}. As an ethic, [care does more than require a
posture of mutual respect, responsibility, and obligation between
individuals]{.underline}. As Christopher Paul Harris states in this
Critical Exchange, 'the only horizon of an ethics of care is a world
undone' -- that is, 'extracting ourselves and each other from the ideas,
values, and institutions of Western modernity.' Yet each contribution
also suggests how a radical abolitionist politics of care is immanent
within the present world -- whether in maroon communities, public
speeches at BLM actions, communal kitchens, or migrant organizing
against borders, globally. **[Care is a collection of principles,
practices, and laws that facilitate communal gathering and the
governance of polities.]{.underline}** The abolitionist politics of care
takes as its central remit and function the self and community
determination, provision, and distribution of responsibilities that is
always required for human life. Therefore, the contributions that follow
build non-ideal theories of care that see contemporary and historical
liberation struggles as not only a gateway to but also preparation for a
different kind of politics, one presenting us with new possibilities for
living together.

The politics of care described here is not wholly new. Theorists of care
enter the disciplinal conversation bearing the lessons of strains of
political theory that have always been present but have often been
marginalized. This tradition has presented care as an ethic, a relation,
a form of labor, an element of cultural reproduction, and a
building-block towards non-capitalist and non-dominative social
relations. At the same time, [we recognize that notions of care have
often been paternalistic, dominative, and even violent]{.underline}.
[Joan Tronto's foundational work calls our attention to the inequalities
perpetuated by care, whether in the form of racialized and gendered
worker/employer relations, or the replacement of democratic commitments
with neoliberal market logics]{.underline} (Tronto, 1993). Held (1993)
suggests how **[care is a political project beyond the
interpersonal]{.underline}**, while Gould (2004) applies this position
to the global. Mignon Duffy (2005) shows how care, when conceived of as
'nurturance,' prioritizes white women to the exclusion of women of
color. Patricia Hill Collins shows how an 'ethic of caring' is needed to
undo 'Eurocentric masculinist' epistemologies through the centering of
Black women's concrete experiences, emotions, and knowledge claims
(1990, p. 765). Kittay (1999), Nussbaum (2007) and Simplican (2015)
examine care through the perspective of disability and dependency, while
Engster (2006) connects debates on care to animal welfare. Feminist
political theorists have called for greater attention to the concrete,
embodied specificities of women as carers and (re)productive laborers
beyond a universal, disembodied conceptualization of citizenship and a
public/private heuristic (Hirschmann, 1992; Threadcraft, 2016; Young,
1990). Others have examined the politics of care and the transformation
of '"common sense" logic' in the arenas of social movements and
democratic societies (Woodly, 2015, p. 5) and welfare retrenchment.

[Beyond political theory, as an institutionally inscribed and
politically constituted field of knowledge, care has long been theorized
expansively as a resource for mutual aid, a colonial discourse, a method
of non-capitalist world-building, a non-biological kinship arrangement,
a collective survival strategy, a liberation politics, and a
non-exploitative relation to land]{.underline}. Uma Narayan highlights
'the self-serving collaboration between elements of colonial rights
discourse and care discourse' (1995, p. 133), while Dean Spade positions
mutual aid as 'an often devalued iteration of radical collective care'
allowing us to re-envision what is politically imaginable (2020a, b, p.
131). Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha (2018) calls for interlocking
'care webs' through a queer-of-color and disability studies lens, while
in 1988 Audre Lorde famously called care for oneself 'an act of
political warfare' in the context of anti-Black violence, misogyny and
homophobia. Parvati Raghuram (2016) argues for a 'multiplicity in care
ethics' beyond the Global North, and indigenous feminist scholars
Melanie Yazzie and Cutcha Risling Baldy see care as a form of 'radical
relationality' with human and non-human life alike (2018, p. 2).

Beyond the academy, collective care is a site of mutual aid,
consciousness raising, and political organizing. The abundant examples
include ACT UP organizing around HIV/AIDS, the Black Panther Free
Breakfast for Children Program, Zapatista practices of community
self-organization, and Palestinian food distribution programs under
Israeli settler colonialism. Abolitionist organizers have used existing
mutual aid networks to provide hygiene supplies to incarcerated
populations since the onset of COVID-19, advocating the release of
vulnerable individuals from prison as one step towards a dismantling of
the carceral system.

The contributions included in this Critical Exchange draw on such
examples to make normative claims about an abolitionist, anti-dominative
horizon of care that is already immanent within radical spaces of
organizing and political transformation. If Tronto's path-breaking work
(2013) points us to the lack of 'caring institutions' under late
capitalism, our contributors build on and expand this theme, asking how
various institutions themselves have been historically constituted by
racism, colonialism, capitalism, imperialism, and cisheteropatriarchy.
Going further, the contributors ask what kinds of questions and
commitments would be required to unmake institutions to deliver more
just relations of power and structural conditions. [They use care as a
method -- a mode of systematic analysis, planning, and action -- to
identify, understand, and change the way we assess and engage the world
we share, within and beyond the state]{.underline}. Stylistically varied
and drawing on a range of genealogical traditions, they illuminate the
necessity of theorizing the political beyond the bounds of abstracted
ideal theory. [They explore care as a practice that commons the
reproductive tasks required for collective survival against state
disinvestment and violence]{.underline}. They position care as an
epistemic commitment addressing historic and ongoing forms of
misrecognition. Finally, they inspire crucial questions about the places
where care, rather than violence, is distributed; collective care as a
form of place making; and how racialized and gendered spaces prescribe
what gets counted as care.

Mara Marin begins our Critical Exchange by observing that, [though the
COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the necessity of care in all its forms,
there is a contradiction at the heart of modern ideologies of
governance, encouraging people and polities to applaud care while
disparaging and/or misrecognizing its material value]{.underline}. Marin
asserts that this misrecognition rests on a conceptual division between
'menial and spiritual' labor which maps onto and maintains a gendered
and racialized division of care. Shatema Threadcraft argues, along with
abolitionists like Davis, Gilmore, and Kaba that mass incarceration
represents a colossal failure of collective care in both principle and
practice. [She illustrates this lack by exploring the example of 'the
sexual assault to juvenile detention pipeline,' a phenomenon that
subjects girls and women who have been victims of abuse to carceral
punishment -- rather than providing systems of support that could
contribute to the recognition of the very conditions that produce their
predicament and remedies that would enable them to live free and
self-determined lives]{.underline}. Christopher Paul Harris highlights
the sharp limitations of any ethics of care that does not purposely
identify and divest from anti-Blackness, racial capitalism, and
cisheteropatriarchy. He emphasizes that a useful ethic of care cannot be
built on sentiment but must be invested in unsettling and undoing
totalizing systems of knowledge that socially construct, politically
maintain, and theoretically justify 'the suffering of others.' Miriam
Ticktin underscores the immanence of this necessary undoing in our
current politics. She suggests how a 'decolonial feminist commons' is a
space of non-hierarchal care, respect, and mutuality where people,
through their collective work, make living possible outside, and in
defiance of, institutions that bar them from being able to care for
themselves and others -- including the institution of private property.
Importantly, the commons are places where notions of deservingness are
irrelevant because people's entitlement to the means of living are not
proscribed by their comportment, social status, legal citizenship, or
other factors routinely disqualifying people from the narrow circle of
neoliberal care. Care, by these lights, is material, practical and
independent of moral dispositions. Jasmine Syedullah concludes this
Critical Exchange with a meditation on abolitionist care as a classroom
pedagogy, which draws on traditions in Black feminist thought to explore
what she calls 'congregational care' methods of being and learning
together. This form of care asks people to lean into their lived
experience, embrace an improvisational orientation, and understand the
essential and deeply generative space created when we admit that we do
not know with certainty how to undo the world that creates structural
conditions of suffering for most people, most of the time. In productive
conversation with Threadcraft, this contribution suggests the
limitations of political recognition, which requires legitimation by --
and legibility to -- the state, as a constitutively violent and
anti-Black formation.

Taken together, these contributions set a new horizon for the vocation
of political theory. The task before us, they argue, is one of colossal
import: a [collaborative, collective effort to exceed the world
modernity made and discover a path forward toward a contemporary
era]{.underline} -- the name of which we do not yet know -- based on the
mutually affirmed conviction that we must make the road toward more just
power relations and more flourishing societies, by leaning into our
questions, relying on abolitionist principles, [and discovering through
imagination and improvisation, a practicable politics of
care.]{.underline}

## AI/Cybernetics Good

### Oncology---1NC

#### Oncology- medication development, diagnosis, and effective treatment

**Kann 22** (Benjamin Kann, MD, "Steady Progress of AI Makes its Mark in
the Clinic", Targeted Oncology, January 30^th^ 2022,
<https://www.targetedonc.com/view/steady-progress-of-ai-makes-its-mark-in-the-clinic>,
WC-NAS)

Only a few years ago, these imagined scenarios may have seemed
far-fetched, but no longer. Increasingly, and with exponential pace,
[[AI algorithms are finding their way into the oncology
clinic.]{.underline}]{.mark} Here, I will review some of the [[promising
ways]{.mark} in which these AI algorithms are poised [to improve
clinical cancer care]{.mark} for providers and patients.]{.underline}
Understanding AI Overall AI is a field of research that began in the
mid-20th century with the goal of developing machines that could perform
tasks that previously only a human could do. Under this umbrella,
"machine learning" was born several decades later, defined as the
ability of algorithms to learn from data without explicit programming.
[Traditional machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression,
support vector machines, and random forest, generally take structured
data inputs---variables such as age, cancer stage, smoking status,
etc---and output predictions based on these features.]{.underline}
[Recently, [major progress in medical AI]{.mark} applications has
[stemmed from "deep learning]{.mark}," an [advanced form of machine
learning that uses neural networks to]{.mark} ingest, synthesize, and
[make predictions]{.mark} with large quantities of raw, unstructured
data. These neural networks draw on, among others, imaging, EHRs, and
genomics.1 When it comes to unstructured data analysis, [deep learning
approaches have been found to outperform most traditional
methods]{.mark} allowing for the modeling of data types that were not
previously feasible.]{.underline} Over the past decade, [[exponentially
increasing quantities of digital patient data]{.mark}, the complexity of
cancer care, advances in AI research, and the ubiquity of advanced
computers have led to tremendous interest and opportunity for AI to make
a large impact in oncology.]{.underline} How AI Is Impacting Oncology
Now? The past decade has seen an explosion in the number of algorithms
published for a variety of applications in oncology, including over 5500
in 2020 alone (an average of 15 per day, according to a simple PubMed
search). Despite this, there are relatively few applications that have
found real-world clinical adoption. Some reasons for this delay include
the nascent state of the field, trust issues with algorithm results, and
a lack of demonstration of value proposition with clinically meaningful
end points. Regarding this latter point, although there are over 340
FDA-cleared medical AI applications, there have been very few randomized
controlled trials (RCT) of AI applications in oncology. Notably, this
number is also rapidly increasing, with more RCTs published in 2021 than
all previous years combined. For these algorithms to truly make a
difference in the clinic, they must cross the "translational gap," which
involves proving that these models can generalize to different
demographic populations and treatment settings outside the setting in
which they were developed.2 It also means showing clinically meaningful
utility--- improved resource utilization, patient quality of life,
disease control, or survival---not just accuracy improvements. Finally,
these algorithms need to be designed to fit into the daily oncology
clinic workflow in such a way that they are user-friendly and easy to
navigate. These tasks are often underappreciated during AI development,
yet require a tremendous amount of attention for the potential promise
of AI in cancer care to be fulfilled. As the number of algorithms and
trials to assess their use in oncology increases, [there are 3 major
areas of oncology practice that [AI is already affecting and
improving.]{.mark} Streamlining Workflow and Replacing the
Mundane]{.underline} Tasks that are simple yet redundant are low-hanging
fruit for AI solutions. [In radiation oncology, for example, contouring
of organs that are at risk in radiotherapy planning is a relatively
straightforward task that takes hours of time to complete per week. Now,
[there are multiple open-source and commercial applications based on AI
that provide organ at risk contouring]{.mark} that is as accurate as
human experts and quicker. Furthermore, some institutions have begun
adopting end-to-end automated radiotherapy treatment planning for
certain malignancies, like prostate cancer.]{.underline}3 [AI is also
being used for automated diagnosis of malignancy on histopathology, to
support pathologists' workflow and enable focus on more complex cases.4
Additionally, [AI]{.mark} is a tool that [can address]{.mark} the
well-documented challenge of [enrolling patients with cancer on to
clinical trials]{.mark}.]{.underline} AI-driven software that combs and
digests an ever-ballooning patient EHR has been implemented as a
clinical trial autoscreening tool and shown to improve the
identification of eligible trial patients.5 [Improved Screening and
Diagnosis There are now several FDA-approved platforms for CT-based lung
cancer nodule detection that have been found to reduce false positive
and negative results, compared with expert radiologists'
results]{.underline}.6,7 There are AI-assisted endoscopy devices that
improve adenomatous polyp detection for colonoscopy screening, with
several randomized trials showing improvements in detection.8,9
Additionally, [[automated]{.mark} [mammography systems are now finding
their way into clinical adoption]{.mark}, having shown improved
sensitivity]{.underline} over experts10 and the ability to perform well
in different patient groups from around the world.11 [Clinical
Recommendations and "Nudges"]{.underline} Traditional means of cancer
prognostication, such as American Joint Committee on Cancer staging and
clinical risk prediction models, although powerful, have limits in their
ability to predict personalized outcomes. [Machine learning has enabled
a class of EHR-based platforms able to risk-stratify patients more
effectively and guide treatment recommendations.]{.underline} For
instance, 1 model predicts patients receiving chemoradiotherapy who are
at high risk of hospitalization, and in a clinical trial found that, for
those patients identified as high risk, more frequent routine clinic
visits prevented hospitalization and emergency department visits.12
Another AI model that identified cancer patients with short life
expectancy was found to increase the rate of serious illness
conversations via physician nudges---cues and reminders to influence a
behavior in a patient.13 Looking Beyond the Horizon of AI While AI has
seen adoption in several cancer care path scenarios, most applications
continue to trickle through the development stage. [Slowly, these
[applications are demonstrating clinical utility]{.mark} via prospective
testing and increasingly common randomized controlled trials that may
lead to adoption [over the next few years]{.mark}.]{.underline} For
example, there is a tremendous amount of interest in using AI to predict
treatment response. Immunotherapy response has been difficult to predict
with traditional biomarkers and there has been significant progress
using various machine learning algorithms to improve predictive
performance. Imagingbased approaches, relying on quantitative imaging
features \[ie, "radiomics"\],14 and genomic-based models have each
demonstrated promise,15 but further validation is needed. Algorithms
such as these may be able to guide and support treatment recommendations
throughout the patient care path. AI has also demonstrated the ability
to "see" things that the naked eye cannot. Through improved digital
pathology analysis, AI has shown the ability to instantly deduce cancer
mutational status simply from traditional tissue slides, which may
replace the often weeks-long turnaround time for running genetic panels
on tumor specimens to allow for quicker decision-making and treatment
initiation.16 Our group has shown the ability for AI to accurately
detect extranodal extension in head and neck lymph nodes on computed
tomography, a difficult task for humans that is extremely important in
choosing a surgical vs nonoperative management approach.17 Finally,
[[anti-cancer drug development is an area where AI is making an
impact]{.mark}. Al can accurately predict the mechanism of action of
certain cancer metabolites,18 as well as predict combinations of drugs
that may work synergistically, which may help guide preclinical and
clinical study design]{.underline}.19

#### The impact is death

**Sleeman et al 21** (Katherine E Sleeman , Barbara Gomes, Maja de Brito

health-related suffering among cancer decedents: Global projections
study to 2060", Palliative Medicine, Volume 35, 2021,

in 2016), [80% of whom will be in low and middle income countries. The
number of people who die from cancer and experience serious
health-related suffering will increase in all world regions, but
proportionately more in low income countries]{.underline} (407% increase
2016--2060 to 1.65 million people each year) [compared to lower-middle
income countries]{.underline} (169% increase 2016--2060 to 4.76 million
people each year)[, upper-middle income countries]{.underline} (96%
increase 2016--2060 to 6.67 million people each year)[, and high income
countries]{.underline} (39% increase 2016--2060 to 3.23 million people
each year) [(Figure 1).]{.underline} Globally, [the burden of serious
health-related suffering among cancer decedents is projected to increase
rapidly among people aged over 70]{.underline} (Figure 2). By 2060, 67%
of people who die with cancer and experience serious health-related
suffering will be over 70 years old, compared to 47% in 2016. The
proportion of people aged over 70 will be highest in high income
countries, where, by 2060, 83% of people who die with cancer and
experience serious health-related suffering will be over 70, compared
with 71% in upper-middle income countries, 52% in lowermiddle income
countries, and 38% in low income countries. By 2060, 54% of people who
die with cancer and experience serious health-related suffering will be
men, and of those over 70 years 57% will be men. In high and
upper-middle income countries, [lung cancer will be the single greatest
contributor to the burden of serious health-related suffering among
cancer decedents in 2060, though the number of people in high income
countries dying with lung cancer who experience serious healthrelated
suffering is projected to fall between 2030 and 2060.]{.underline} In
low and lower-middle income countries, breast cancer will be the single
greatest contributor to serious healthrelated suffering among cancer
decedents (Figure 3).

#### AI=healthcare/hospital efficiency

**Olive 21** (Olive AI, "Working hand-in-hand with AI: The cybernetic
future of AI in healthcare", March 3^rd^ 2021,
<https://oliveai.com/resources/blog/working-hand-in-hand-with-ai-the-cybernetic-future-of-ai-in-healthcare?page=1>,
WC-NAS)

[Health systems and hospitals are constantly looking for new ways to
improve efficiencies and remove friction from their operations. Yet
healthcare workers today are drowning in a sea of data and programs.
Burnout is soaring and COVID-19 has only exacerbated the need for
efficiency and capacity.]{.underline} Health systems looking to do more
with less are tapping into technology to help their workers navigate
their jobs quickly and efficiently.  [Health system executives are
turning to AI -- including automation and the growing field of
cybernetics -- to improve productivity and decision-making while
reducing burnout. AI is delivering targeted information to workers to
enable better, faster results across hospitals and health systems at a
time when time is more valuable than ever.]{.underline}

[Cybernetics plus intelligent automation will power our human
workforces\
When health systems consider investing in artificial intelligence
technologies, they typically look at robotic process automation (RPA)
or [intelligent automation solutions
first](https://oliveai.com/our-solution/). That's because repetitive,
high-volume workflows that provide high-value returns lay a solid
foundation for a larger investment in your long-term AI strategy.
Intelligent automation allows us to offload [routine, time-intensive
data
entry ](https://oliveai.com/blog/11-operational-applications-for-healthcare-ai/)to
machines so that our human workforces can focus on higher-level
initiatives that require a human touch.]{.underline} Automation is
fundamentally changing how hospitals and health systems manage
healthcare operations, freeing up our human workers to focus on what
matters most -- delivering quality patient experiences. But giving more
work to intelligent automation bots isn't the only [operational
application of
AI](https://oliveai.com/blog/11-operational-applications-for-healthcare-ai/).
After time-consuming, repetitive tasks are offloaded to automation,
there's enormous opportunity to improve the processes still requiring a
human touch. That's why health systems are augmenting the work that
can't be automated with cybernetics. \
[Cybernetics is a quickly developing field that will become
indispensable in helping employers maximize the ROI of their human
workforce while also improving employee satisfaction and work-life
balance.]{.underline}

The benefits of cybernetics for healthcare

Cybernetics fuels human productivity by reducing errors, improving
efficiency, improving decision making and therefore increasing human
ROI. Here are a few examples of how a cybernetic AI solution can
work:  [[Welcome Home Health](https://www.welcomehomehealth.com/) (WHH),
a company that facilitates care transitions to improve patient adherence
to care management plans, has created a cybernetic process to improve
decision making. The WHH cybernetic model synthesizes each patient's
clinical needs with their diagnosis, acuity, social determinant and
payer information to assign them to a specific WHH program and
enrollment path]{.underline} (e.g., should the patient go to a skilled
nursing facility or home?). [By providing the appropriate level of care
and support, WHH can help patients recover more quickly and reduce
hospital readmissions]{.underline}.  At the Ohio State University Wexner
Medical Center, cybernetics is being implemented in the scheduling
department to help staff members schedule patients more quickly and with
fewer errors. Included is a feature that automatically pulls up a
patient's weight when scheduling an x-ray or imaging appointment. This
information is necessary, but can be embarrassing to ask a patient
in-person or can require opening up another program and searching. Every
time that a patient is scheduled, the information critical to that
specific appointment can be whispered to the scheduler and then checked
for accuracy before being set. Think about your own organization -- what
workflows often require real-time intelligence or outside references?
What decisions could benefit from an unbiased recommendation based on
data synthesization? [Cybernetics is the way to get targeted, precise
information into employees' hands. Each time an employee doesn't have to
switch programs to look up information, you gain
efficiencies.]{.underline} Each time a recommendation is provided by
sophisticated analytics, you improve decision-making. Each time a typo
is flagged, you reduce costly errors. [Cybernetics, combined with
automation, will help healthcare organizations do so much more with the
resources they already have.]{.underline}

Artificial intelligence can change your healthcare organization today\
[Artificial intelligence is changing how we work
today](https://oliveai.com/blog/ai-automation-and-the-future-of-work-in-hospitals/),
not the distant future. But it\'s not the AI depicted in science fiction
where robots take over our jobs. Artificial intelligence, including
intelligent automation and cybernetics, has functional, cost-effective
solutions now for healthcare. [By shifting humans to human work and
giving them an AI-powered sidekick to help them throughout the day,
hospitals and health systems can maximize the productivity, ROI and
impact of the human workforce.]{.underline}  Our cybernetic solution is
Olive Helps,  an AI "sidekick" that lives on a healthcare worker's
computer. It's a lightweight desktop application working alongside users
that provides valuable information -- at exactly the right time -- using
what we call Loops (think: apps in an app store.) By continuously
learning from the cues in her environment, Olive Helps minimize the time
required to complete critical tasks like patient verifications, billing
and more. [See how cybernetics can improve your workforce ROI

### Climate Change---1NC

#### Cybernetics and AI critical to predicting and preventing climate catastrophe

Agency for ICT's, "AI expands scope of climate change", July 13^th^

[Nearly [37 per cent of heat exposure]{.mark} around the world between
1991 and 2018 could be [attributed to global warming caused by
humans]{.mark}]{.underline}, Ban added, citing research published in
[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01475-0#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20attributed%2037%25%20of,such%20as%20storms%20and%20droughts).
Rising sea levels threaten the existence of many small island developing
states, as well as some of world's largest and most important cities,
both rich and poor. "Climate threats do not discriminate," he said.
[Climate change is one of the most serious challenges we face
today]{.underline}, agreed Professor Philip Stier of Atmospheric Physics
at the University of Oxford. [But [climate science is inherently
complex]{.mark}, [involving]{.mark} [massive]{.mark} uncertainties and
multiple feedback [effects from different changes]{.mark} in our climate
and environment. The webinar examined the [many]{.mark} exciting
[capabilities]{.mark} [of]{.mark} artificial intelligence ([AI]{.mark})
[to help climate science]{.mark} see where we really are with global
warming and assessing realistic mitigation options.]{.underline}
Untangling the data [While vast Earth observation datasets are at heart
of climate science, only a small fraction of such data is currently used
to "train" climate models, Stier said. [AI]{.mark} [could help to draw
more value from those data sources.]{.mark} As one example, [AI could
extend the analysis of climate datasets over longer timeframes]{.mark},
taking paleo-climate data from past eons into account]{.underline},
added Valérie Masson-Delmotte, Co-Chair of the "Physical Science Basis"
working group of the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC)](https://www.ipcc.ch/). "There is a massive amount of historical
information that exists, but sometimes it's not readily available or not
yet digitalized," she said. [Furthermore, [AI can improve our
understanding of feedback effects, narrow down uncertainties, and detect
key signals from vast masses of unanalysed data, or "background
noise".]{.mark}]{.underline} With better-quality data and specialized
inventories, [it could help to unpack more of the interactions involved
in climate change and further [illuminate how the climate crisis could
evolve]{.mark}.]{.underline} Exploring causality For years,
international attention centred mainly on the effects of carbon dioxide
(CO2), although [methane gas](https://unece.org/challenge) also drives
warming. AI could also help to understand the key role of [oceans as
heat and CO2
absorbers](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/09/200904090312.htm).
The IPCC studies the causes and impact of climate change on a rigorously
scientific basis, Masson-Delmotte said. Following the science, [recent
IPCC reports](https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/), produced with 230
scientists from 160 countries, suggest a global imperative to cut CO2
and other greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. As policy makers make
tough choices on behalf of their citizens, algorithms can heighten
space-time resolution and clarify stochastic aspects in climate
modelling. Machine learning, for instance, helps to explore causality
and capture dynamics at lower spatial and temporal resolution, explained
Yoshua Bengio, Director of the Quebec AI Institute, Mila. But while
machine learning can heighten our understanding of the crisis, countries
must adopt accurate carbon pricing to reflect the true impact of all our
activities, Bengio said. Effective carbon pricing, he noted, would
include the cost of uncertainty. Numerous researchers are eager to help
with improving the sustainability of transportation, discovering new
production materials, stepping up conservation, and helping people
better understand the changes that are coming, Bengio said. "New
technologies," added Masson-Delmotte, "can help build on local knowledge
through citizen science and participatory approaches." Calls for
concerted action The Paris Agreement, signed by 195 nations worldwide,
set out a clear game plan to fight rising emissions, spur
climate-resilient development and foster greener socio-economic
development. Over 60 other countries have set their sights on carbon
neutrality by 2050, while the largest market, China, has pledged to
become carbon-neutral by 2060. Multilateral action is vital, Ban
reiterated. Houlin Zhao, Secretary-General of ITU, called for active
partnerships to coordinate ICT innovation and address the global climate
challenge.

#### Climate change!

**Nelsen 21** (Arthur Nelsen, "How can artificial intelligence help
fight climate change?", August 5^th^ 2021, Thomson Reuters Foundation,

How can AI help combat climate change?

The technology is already [being
used](https://news.trust.org/item/20210308082452-utr0s/) to send natural
disaster alerts in Japan, monitor deforestation in the Amazon, and
design greener [smart
cities](https://news.trust.org/item/20200624080235-95zxs) in China.

AI applications could also help design more energy-efficient buildings,
improve power storage and optimise renewable energy deployment by
feeding solar and wind power into the electricity grid as needed.

On a smaller scale, it could help households minimize their energy use -
automatically switching off lights not in use or sending power from
electric vehicles back into the grid to meet anticipated demand.

By 2030, the tech could help cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 4%,
according to a
recent [study](https://www.pwc.co.uk/services/sustainability-climate-change/insights/how-ai-future-can-enable-sustainable-future.htmlhttps:/www.pwc.co.uk/services/sustainability-climate-change/insights/how-ai-future-can-enable-sustainable-future.html) by
accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers for Microsoft, which is
developing machine learning products for the climate change market.

Peter Clutton-Brock, co-founder of the Centre for AI and Climate (CAIC),
a Britain-based think tank, said the technology was \"pushing back
boundaries\" for climate modelling.

AI can process huge amounts of unstructured data like pictures, graphs
and maps, opening \"huge possibilities for understanding the dynamics
around sea level rise and ice sheets,\" he told the Thomson Reuters
Foundation.

Who will be able to use it?          

The high cost of AI computational resources has pushed research largely
into the private sector, where the market is \"extremely vibrant,\"
according to Chris Goode, Climavision\'s CEO. 

Climavision\'s system uses a high-resolution radar network along with
data from satellites and high-altitude weather balloons to fill in what
the company says are \"hundreds of gaps\" in existing weather
forecasting networks.

Energy and transport businesses, farmers, even the U.S. military will
have access to \"real-time elements of the atmosphere, what\'s happening
at this very moment, because it\'s updated on a second-by-second mode,\"
Goode said.  

Ari Cohen, the external affairs director for TPG, which last week
announced a new \$5.4 billion [Rise Climate
fund](https://therisefund.com/news/tpg-announces-54-billion-first-close-tpg-rise-climate-fund) to
invest in \"climate solutions around the world\", said the AI market was
likely to grow, as countries and corporations transition toward
low-carbon energy.

From electricity grids to smart appliances, \"data and AI-driven
software will be integral to predicting market behaviour, balancing
operations in real time and maximising energy yield,\" he said in
emailed comments.

Unprecedented increases in global temperatures are
unequivocally [caused](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf#page=6) by
humans, according to the [United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change](https://www.ipcc.ch/) (IPCC). A "strong and sustained
reduction" in greenhouse gas pollution is necessary to limit further
climate change, and every country must make unprecedented
changes, [reports](https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/) the
IPCC.

In
an [article](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg), [Amy
L. Stein](https://www.law.ufl.edu/faculty/amy-l-stein), a professor at
the [University of Florida Levin College of
Law](https://www.law.ufl.edu/), [argues](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg) that
artificial intelligence could play an important role in reducing
greenhouse gas emissions in the electric power industry. Given that
electric
power [accounts](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=11) for
almost 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide,
Stein [sees](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=12) a
role for artificial intelligence in optimizing the power grid,
increasing energy efficiency, and enhancing reliability and resiliency.
Furthermore,
Stein [argues](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=38) for
the use of regulation as a tool to offset limitations of using
artificial intelligence.

Artificial intelligence---also known as machine learning and automated
data
analytics---can [optimize](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=12) the
power grid's energy use by helping utility companies manage an increase
in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power.
Stein [explains](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=14) that
artificial intelligence can identify factors that most impact energy
demand and immediately optimize energy output. For instance, artificial
intelligence
can [learn](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=15) "the
thermal properties of a home, the local weather conditions, the way
these conditions impact heat flows of a home, and user preferences, as
well as adapt energy consumption against real-time price signals."

Stein
also [explains](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=17) how
artificial intelligence can target energy inefficiencies. Nearly 68
percent of
energy [produced](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=17) in
the United States is "lost to the environment," she observes. This lost
energy
often [takes](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=17) the
form of "waste heat, such as the warm exhaust from automobiles."
Stein [suggests](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=18) that
artificial intelligence can help isolate would-be rejected energy before
it is lost, just as when
Google [used](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=19) artificial
intelligence to reduce its data centers' excess heat production by 40
percent. Addressing energy inefficiencies,
Stein [argues](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=20),
can have "enormous impacts on carbon emissions," perhaps reducing
greenhouse gas pollution in half by 2050.

Stein [says](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=20) that
artificial intelligence can also help enhance the reliability and
resiliency of the electric power grid.
Blackouts [harm](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=21) the
environment because they create "downtime" in the power grid that
requires significant energy to overcome. Artificial intelligence
can [predict](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=22) impending
power outages by accurately forecasting weather patterns and rapidly
assessing the power grid for weak spots. This
assessment [reduces](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=21) "catastrophic"
environmental harm because it allows utility companies both to prevent
outages and respond more quickly when one occurs.

Despite the potential benefits of using artificial intelligence to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the electric power industry,
Stein [concedes](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=27) that
this technology does present some tradeoffs.

If not used efficiently, artificial intelligence can itself increase
environmental harm. For instance, data processing
centers [use](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=28) about
2 percent of the global electricity supply. By 2025, that number could
rise to between 8 and 21 percent. Requiring researchers to disclose how
much energy an artificial intelligence tool will emit,
Stein [claims](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=30),
can temper negative environmental impacts.

One way to limit artificial intelligence's negative effects would be
to [create](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=31) certification
requirements, similar to the regulations used to label organic food.
Stein [explains](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=31) that
regulators could create a system that labels "carbon-neutral artificial
intelligence as 'green' and non-carbon-neutral artificial intelligence
as 'red.'"
She [posits](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=31) that
these labels will increase transparency and encourage researchers to
create more artificial intelligence that has a positive or neutral
impact on the environment.

Stein [acknowledges](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=34) that
artificial intelligence may also increase data privacy concerns. For
example, smart meters---devices used to read energy-use patterns in
homes---[reveal](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=35) behavioral
patterns, such as bedtimes, work departures, and vacations. This
information can
be [exploited](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=35),
such as for planning home invasions or identity theft.

To offset data privacy concerns,
Stein [argues](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=36) that
the government can mandate utility companies to anonymize certain data.
For instance, the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html) requires
that protected health information is "not individually identifiable."

Stein
further [explains](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=37) that
data privacy concerns can be eased by regulating data ownership, use,
and distribution. Colorado, for
example, [regulates](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=38) the
use of smart meter data by only allowing third party access in emergency
situations.
Stein [contends](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=38) that
regulators can lessen data privacy concerns by creating policy that
adequately weighs the public interest, industry concerns, and individual
privacy protection.

Stein [acknowledges](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=38) that
regulating artificial intelligence will be difficult because it requires
administrative law to adapt as quickly as technology does. But in the
end,
she [concludes](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1565&context=yjreg#page=50) that
the gravity of climate change combined with artificial intelligence's
promise make it "too important not to try."

### Readiness---1NC

#### Cybernetics is inevitable and key to avoid future conflict

**Scott 21** (Dr Keith Scott, "Connected, Continual Conflict: Towards a
Cybernetic Model of Warfare", De Montfort University, Leicester, UK,
2021,
<https://dora.dmu.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2086/20901/K%20Scott%20Revised%20Paper%20text.docx?sequence=1&isAllowed=y>,
WC-NAS)

The differences are striking; for some, this is a form of conflict which
focuses on the disruption/destruction of a state's informational assets
through the application of non-kinetic, IT and AI-based tools
(essentially a form of Electronic Warfare), while for others, it implies
a much broader set of actions, where non-kinetic action generates
effects (which may cause damage equivalent or identical to kinetic
force) far beyond the informational realm. Furthermore, the actors in
such conflict may be nation states or non-state actors, and the targets
may be military and/or civilian, attacking critical national
infrastructure, financial institutions, and the beliefs of the citizenry
(Information Warfare). In short, it is a form of conflict where lots of
things are done to lots of people in lots of different ways by lots of
different actors; as a theoretical framework for analysis and action,
this is less than helpful. The one common feature the definitions have
is an insistence that this form of conflict relies on the use of IT-
and/or AI-enabled attacks; in other words, 'cyber' resides firmly within
the Fifth Domain or Fifth Dimension of warfare, the informational realm
(Fogleman 1995). Such a model is, I would argue, so imprecise as to be
useless; it neglects the key nature of modern conflict (and of the
modern world in general) -- connection. The belated move to Multi-Domain
Integration in military thinking (see Section 2.0) marks a recognition
of the fact that dividing the world into 5 discrete domains is both
illusory and dangerous; we cannot see the domains as separate, and
crucially, we must not assume that the informational realm can be
confronted in isolation. For the purposes of this paper, then. 'an act
of cyber warfare' should be taken to mean 'any hostile action by a state
or non-state equivalent actor launched against another state or
non-state equivalent actor, which aims to cause kinetic and/or
non-kinetic damage to the opponent's human/material/intangible assets,
and which employs IT-based tools, networks and/or assets.' 'Cyber' has
become a catchall term for 'anything involving computers'; this is both
too vague and too precise; *computers* are not the important element,
rather the system of integrated elements which make up the informational
network which underpins and penetrates the modern world. Some of these
elements are electronic, some are mechanical, some physical, some
abstract (software does not 'exist' as a concrete artefact) -- and many
of them are human. The theoretical bedrock of this paper, and of the
argument it advances, is that 'cyber' is meaningless; the term it
derives from is what is important. We must turn, or return, to a
cyber*netic* framework. The reason for this is simple; [[cybernetics
offers a]{.mark} system-based model for [understanding]{.mark} the
informational network(s) [within which Cyber Warfare operates]{.mark},
and it [focuses on interconnection, and the interreactions within these
networks of non-human and human elements.]{.mark}]{.underline}
'Cybernetics' may seem just as vague a term as 'Cyberwarfare', but that
is to neglect an essential feature of the discipline; it is less a model
for understanding a particular system (electronic, human, mechanical...)
than a way of thinking about systems in general. The term was first used
by Ampère (1834) to refer to political (i.e. human) governance, while
the subtitle of Wiener's seminal text Cybernetics (1948) discusses
'control and communication in the animal and the machine' (my emphasis).
[By its very nature, cybernetics is interdisciplinary, and offers a
model for analysing the interplay and interconnection of the various
components of any system; it is, as Beer (1973) puts it, 'the science of
effective organization'. As such, [the adoption of a 'cybernetic
mindset' as the basis for the consideration of contemporary and future
conflict seems not only advisable but essential.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[As will be argued, both in terms of the complexity and protean nature
of warfare in the Information Age, and in the growing convergence of
human and non-human actors in the battlespace (human-machine teaming,
autonomous weapons systems and augmentation of combat troops all falling
within this ambit), the holistic, [systems-based worldview offered by
cybernetics seems to be unavoidable]{.mark} if we are to stand any
chance of overcoming the threats we face. As with any discipline,
cybernetic military thinking can follow many different
paths.]{.underline} on the one hand, we have the more traditional
C2C-based ideas of informational superiority seen in Cebrowski and
Garstka's work on 'network-centric warfare' (1998); on the other, the
work of Antoine Bousquet (2008a and b), whose theories of 'chaoplexic
warfare' discuss the challenges of waging a war which is non-linear,
dynamic, and self-organizing, and where the opposing forces reject
traditional notions of hierarchy and chains of command. It is this
latter perspective which seems to offer the best approach to what we see
emerging on the contemporary battlespace, as the following section will
argue. In many of today's conflicts, there is no single 'enemy', rather
a swarm of different groups and actors, sharing knowledge and resources,
forming temporary alliances, and highly dynamic, ever-shifting
formations. [[The cybernetic perspective]{.mark}, focusing on the
network rather than individual agents/nodes within that network, [is
better equipped to respond to the current and future challenges.]{.mark}
When conflicts operate across domains, collapse boundaries between state
and non-state, private and public sector, military and civilian and
kinetic and non-kinetic attacks, [the Gestalt perspective of cybernetics
offers a way of cutting through the complexity to understand the
situation in its totality.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### CRISPR---1NC

#### CRISPR solves a laundry list of emerging problems -- disease, crops, and sustainability. Good governance solves ethical issues. 

**Crawford 17 -- **Writer and Editor at MC2 Solutions LLC, MS Geology
from the University of Toronto. \[Mark. "8 Ways CRISPR-Cas9 Can Change
the World." American Society of Mechanical Engineers. May 31, 2017\]

[Genetic engineering is on the cusp of transformational change, thanks
to CRISPR-Cas9]{.underline}, a genome-editing tool that came to the
forefront in 2012. Created by co-inventor Jennifer Doudna, a molecular
biologist at University of California-Berkeley, CRISPR-Cas9 allows
scientists to alter the DNA of different organisms with high speed and
precision (until just recently, engineering genes was a time-consuming
and laborious procedure that often ended in failure).

CRISPR works by injecting a DNA construct into a living organism. The
construct is composed of the Cas9 enzyme that cuts or deletes a segment
of DNA, a sequence of RNA that guides the Cas9 to the correct location
to cut, and a new DNA template that repairs the cut and alters the gene.

"[We are getting to a point where we can investigate different
combinations of genes, controlling when, where, and how much they are
expressed, and investigate the roles of individual bases of
DNA,"]{.underline} states Nicola Patron, a molecular and synthetic
biologist at the Earlham Institute in the UK, in a recent article on
vox.com. "**[Understanding what DNA sequences do is what enables us to
solve problems in every field of biology from curing human diseases, to
growing enough healthy food, to discovering and making new medicines, to
understanding why some species are going extinct."]{.underline}**

Eight Impacts of CRISPR

Below are [eight ways that CRISPR will likely impact the
world]{.underline}:

1\. **[Remove malaria from mosquitos]{.underline}**. [Scientists have
created mosquitoes that are resistant to malaria by deleting a segment
of mosquito DNA]{.underline}. The altered mosquitos passes on the
resistance genes to 99 percent of their offspring, even when they mated
with normal mosquitos.

2\. **[Treating Alzheimer's disease]{.underline}**. [CRISPR-based
platforms have been developed to identify the genes controlling the
cellular processes that lead to neurodegenerative diseases like
Alzheimer\'s and Parkinson\'s]{.underline}, hopefully leading to new
treatments.

3\. **[Treating HIV]{.underline}**. The HIV virus inserts its DNA into
the cells of the human host. [CRISPR has been successful in removing the
virus's DNA from the patient's genome.]{.underline} Other genetic
sequences will likely be found that eliminate HIV, herpes, hepatitis,
and other dangerous viruses.

4\. **[Develop new drugs]{.underline}**. Pharmaceutical companies such
as Bayer AG are investing hundreds of millions of dollars to [develop
CRISPR-based drugs to treat heart disease, blood disorders, and
blindness.]{.underline}

5\. **[Livestock]{.underline}**. [CRISPR/Cas9 has been utilized in China
to delete genes in livestock that inhibit muscle and hair growth to grow
larger stock for the country\'s commercial meat and wool
industries.]{.underline} This could become a common way in the future to
expand livestock industries.

6\. [**Agricultural crops**. Researchers are using CRISPR to discover
new ways to improve crop disease resistance and environmental stress
tolerance in plants]{.underline}. If successful, this could result in
new crops to help feed the global population.

7\. [**Develop new cancer treatments**. CRISPR can modify immune cells
to make them more effective at targeting and destroying cancer cells.
CRISPR can also be used evaluate how genes can be studied to determine
their sensitivity to new anti-cancer drugs,]{.underline} thereby
developing a personalized treatment plan with the best possibility of
success.

8**[. Reduce our need for plastic]{.underline}**. [CRISPR can be used to
manipulate a type of yeast that transforms sugars into hydrocarbons,
which can be used to make plastic]{.underline}---greatly reducing the
need to rely on petroleum-based resources for plastics, easing stress on
the environment.

Editing Humans

Ethical issues abound for genetic engineering with CRISPR---especially
in humans. Many people are concerned about the creation of \"designer
babies\" with genetic enhancements. The technology could be used to
create genetic discrimination through eugenics. "We could see the
emergence of genetic haves and have nots, leading to even greater
inequality than we already live with," comments Marcy Darnovsky of San
Francisco\'s Center for Genetics and Society.

The UK has formally approved gene editing in human embryos, for research
purposes only. In the U.S., a science advisory panel formed by the
National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine has
shown for modifying human embryos with certain heritable diseases.

CRISPR has the distinct ability to alter the course of human
evolution---to improve society for the greater good or, in the wrong
hands, [to diminish the human experience. Most genetic engineers agree
that they must proceed with caution and good governance]{.underline}.

Method

An online survey was conducted between January and April 2018 to gather
expert opinions on potential benefits of NBTs. The **[survey was emailed
to a panel of 507 international experts]{.underline}** (scientists,
government officials, agribusiness professionals, etc.) **[with related
backgrounds and experience in biotechnology]{.underline}**. **[The
survey instrument is part of a multi-year survey project investigating
expert opinions regarding the application of NBTs and their potential to
enhance global food security]{.underline}**. The expert panel was
obtained from a contact database that was constructed using emails of
participants for a number of conferences on biotechnology organized by
the researchers over the past 15 years, and of experts from online
searches (i.e. websites of universities, research institutions, biotech
companies and government agencies). This panel allowed us to reach a
large number of international experts in the field of study.

Our study (BEH 97) was deemed exempt from full ethics review by the
Behavioural Ethics Board at the University of Saskatchewan on April 7,
2015, on the basis that the participants, as experts, were not
themselves the focus of the research.Footnote1 Nevertheless, our online
survey presented participants with a standard consent statement
describing the study, identifying the absence of known risks associated
with participation, and a reminder that participation was voluntary and
responses would be anonymous and confidential. Upon expression of
consent, participants were presented with the survey.

The survey included three opinion-based questions. The first and second
questions were phrased as short statements, soliciting responses on a
five-point Likert scale. [Respondents were invited to provide their
agreement with a list of different potential benefits of genome-edited
crops compared to GM and CONV alternatives]{.underline}, along with
their confidence level on a five-point Likert scale (1 being least
confident and 5 being most confident). [Benefits of genome-edited crops
were measured using 15 agronomic, environmental, and socio-economic
factors]{.underline}. We acknowledge that these benefits can be achieved
'theoretically' by any of these three technologies, however, feasible
outcomes of some techniques are restricted by regulatory burden, high
costs, lengthy process and low consumer acceptance. The third question
asked about the anticipated significance (i.e. minor, moderate or major)
of a number of potential regulatory events in influencing where and how
genome editing will be developed and used in agriculture.

At the end of the survey, a hypothetical binary choice question was
asked to test for temporal preferences (using a lottery prize).
Participants were asked how they would use an imaginary prize of \$5000:
for a summer vacation or for retirement saving. The question was used to
compare the benefits-related questions between two groups of experts:
those who tend to exhibit long- versus short-term preferences. This
question was used only for classification purposes and it is not
intended as a substitute for theoretical discounting models. It was
useful in the context of our study to have a simple, univariate measure
of discounting that was not tied to any specific theoretical
framework.Footnote2

Results and analysis

The survey was completed by 114 respondents, resulting in a response
rate of 22.5%. The sample is dominated by male subjects (79%), aged
between 45 and 65 years (70%). Fifty-three percent of participants
reside in North America, 28% in Europe, and the remainder from the rest
of the world (4% from Africa, 6% from Asia, 4% from Oceania and 5% from
Central and South America). Sixty-three percent identified themselves as
scientists and 37% as non-scientists (government officials, agribusiness
delegates, etc.). Forty percent work for industry, 26% for university,
and 20% for government.

As clarified earlier, not all genome-edited crops fall into the same
category[. Results of previous surveys within this project show that
expert decision makers agree that some genome-edited crops are
transgenic and thus should be regulated as GM while others should
not]{.underline} (Lassoued et al. 2018). Having this result in mind, the
analysis below compares site-specific genome-edited crops (free from
foreign DNA) to GM and CONV counterparts. On average, the mean level of
benefits of genome-edited crops compared to GM (CONV) alternatives was
3.6 (3.75) with a standard deviation (SD) of .73 (.73) on the
one-to-five scale. This reveals that **[experts largely agree on the
potential benefits of genome-edited crops in terms of agronomic
performance (disease resistance, drought tolerance, high yields, etc.),
final product quality (nutrition, shelf life, etc.), climate change
resilience, and global food security]{.underline}** (Table 1). More than
half of the sample was undecided (neutral or cannot tell) about the
impact of genome-edited crops on environmental sustainability (e.g.
reduced agri-food waste, enhanced biodiversity) and economic advantages
for farmers (i.e. higher returns). As for the impact of genome-edited
crops on consumer confidence, environmental footprint and trade, a
plurality tends to be neutral or cannot tell at 46%, 45% and 44%,
respectively.

Table 1 Expert opinions of impact of genome editing compared to GM and
CONV (N = 114)

Full size table

Similarly, the majority of experts believe that **[genome editing offers
more opportunity than CONV to produce crops with improved agronomic
performance, product quality, farmer profitability]{.underline}** (lower
production cost, higher income), **[climate resilience, and global food
security]{.underline}**. [These advantages are derived from the accuracy
and precision of genome-editing technology that some say could help save
years of development time and lower the cost to produce certain traits
in crops]{.underline}. Yet, opinions on socio-political and
environmental questions are less consistent. While 68% of the
participants agree/strongly agree that genome editing will enable
breeders to lower agriculture's environmental footprint, the sample is
divided into those who are optimistic that genome editing could be more
effective than CONV breeding in creating varieties that would reduce
agri-food waste (49%) and enhance biodiversity (39%) and those who are
neutral (41% and 42%). Experts are also divided about whether
genome-edited crops will enhance consumer confidence or open foreign
market access: 35% and 34% think it will not help at all and 40% and 34%
are uncertain. Only about a quarter of the sample (26%) agree/strongly
agree that genome-edited crops might help resolve trade restrictions and
enhance consumer confidence. Genome editing is still a relatively new
technology. Like any innovation, its effects are still somewhat
speculative. Many panelists commented that while existing
biotechnologies can deliver similar benefits to genome-edited crops,
products of genome editing might gain better socio-political advantages.

Overall, [**experts converged on a consensus that genome editing would
offer better agronomic performance and product quality than the
alternatives**. Yet this does not imply that genome-editing technology
is the ideal substitute for GM and CONV breeding techniques---they can
and probably will coexist. GM and CONV still deliver important benefits,
but genome editing would appear to deliver certain benefits better and
faster thanks to its precision (]{.underline}advanced knowledge in
genomics) and the potential lower regulatory oversight. Innovative plant
breeding does not necessarily mean abandoning earlier breeding methods
as different technologies might perform better than others for different
breeding targets. For instance, the GM approach, despite being less
precise, has the potential to perform better than genome editing to
control certain viruses (see e.g. Ali et al. 2016; Lassoued et al.
2018). Yet, GM technology has been facing several regulatory and social
barriers that limited the agronomic (and subsequently socio-economic)
potential in rice and wheat, the world's most important staple grains.

#### CRISPR produced the second wave of GM crops. That resolves food insecurity by improving yields and managing negative traits and resolves the short comings of first gen GMOs.

2021. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06477-9\]

Why [CRISPR/Cas9 edited crops are not considered GM crops]{.underline}?

Both mutagenesis and the CRISPR/Cas9 systems are considered equivalent
as these approaches induce mutation. **[Using the CRISPR/Cas9 approach,
no foreign DNA is left in the mutated plant that makes it exempted from
the definition of GMO and its regulation.]{.underline}** Also, the gRNA
that is used in the CRISPR/Cas9 system is not rDNA (Recombinant DNA).
The organism created by the oligonucleotide-directed mechanism is
considered a GMO because introducing oligonucleotide is not a natural
process. [Thus, there is always confusion between genetically modified
crops and genetically engineered crops which is also a consequence, of
people not accepting GE crops.]{.underline} In GM organisms or
traditional transgenesis, there is no control on site of gene
introduction and about its amplification (copies,) [while in GE
organisms (using nucleases including CRISPR/Cas9) any gene can be
introduced or deleted at a specific location that helps in the
modification of DNA.]{.underline} Thus, **[this technique shows more
advantages over first-generation GM due to its precision, controllable
nature, and low target effects]{.underline}**. Apart from this, all the
editing process was done using single-locus so that it can be readily
accessible and available to researchers for use in their area of
research.

Crop improvement using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology

**[With the increasing population, food demand is also increasing. Crop
improvement is an important endeavor for meeting this requirement. The
CRISPR/Cas9 system acted as a revolutionary technology in crop
improvement which mainly focuses on improving yields, stress management,
and quality by knocking out genes showing undesirable
traits.]{.underline}** This [technique is used to achieve powdery mildew
resistance in Wheat]{.underline} (Triticum aestivum) and tomato by
knocking out the MLO gene \[24\]. In Glycine max, the Fatty Acid
Desaturase gene converts Oleic acid into Linolenic acid. The
[CRISPR-cas9 system can be applied to]{.underline} induce mutation in
FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B that restricts the conversion into linolenic acid
and thus [enhancing its nutrition index and shelf life]{.underline}
\[25\].

Constructs of sgRNA and Cas9 were used to deliver ripening inhibitor
protein (RIN) to regulate fruit ripening in tomato \[26\]. Cas9
construct with HDR template is used to target an Aceto-lactate synthase
(ALS) gene in rice to obtain bi-allelic mutation \[27\]. [The
CRISPR/Cas9 system is also a valuable tool for activation and repression
for transcription of the targeted gene in any plant genome.]{.underline}
Catalytically inactive dCas9, fused with gRNA, can activate
transcription of anthocyanin pigment by targeting AtPAP1 \[28\]. The
dCas9-VP64 has reversed the silencing effect of methylation of AtFIS2 in
fertilization-independent seed in Arabidopsis. The use of these
nucleases has allowed scientists to develop the desired plant varieties
more efficiently and rapidly than conventional breeding. [**This
technology also enhances the domestication of orphan crops including
finger millet, groundnut, tef, yam, and cassava**. In almonds, the
CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been used to produce plants with sweet seeds
but carries bitterness in other plants due to amygdalin. **This
domestication plays an important role in increasing global food security
with the CRISPR/Cas9 technology.**]{.underline} But with the advancement
of these gene-editing technologies, it remains to know how the public
perceives these crops and how regulatory realms will deal with them.

#### Criticisms of GM crops result from a lack of knowledge and trust *not* scientific backing. And, CRISPR resolves consumer fears of first gen gmos.

Views of public towards GM and GE crops

[The major problem faced by GM and GE crops is public
acceptance.]{.underline} These engineered crops have been grown
commercially since the 1990s and have expanded to various nations
including the USA, Brazil, and India. But at the same time, some people
are inadmissible about food products of GMs. [The major reason for this
may be the potential environmental and health risks due to unwilling
genetic changes, lack of trust in multinational agrochemical companies,
lack of knowledge about GE crops, ethical issues, adequacy of regulatory
systems, and off-target mutations]{.underline}. Lack of trust in
companies was clearly expressed both in a survey and in focus groups in
a recent Norwegian study \[52\]. Similar attitudes have also been
documented in Swedish reports \[53\]. Many surveys have also found that
in European countries, consumers are more concerned about food security
\[37\]. The consumers in European countries, also emphasized issues
including origin and quality of food products (European \[54\]. In
addition, the concern with naturalness in food production, exemplified
by cisgenic modification is more acceptable than transgenic in public
surveys \[55, 56[\]. To overcome these challenges, people should be
informed about the difference between GM and GE crops]{.underline}
(Table 3) with the pros and cons of breeding techniques. [GE crops are
free of the transgene, thus no flow of transgene and do not affect
biological diversity in overall]{.underline}. Major arguments in favor
and against GE crops are also tabulated in Table 4. [GE crops are very
similar to wild species and so tagged with a DNA tag and should be
assessed in the isolated field for their impact on the
environment.]{.underline} Secondly, a global regulatory model is
expected to fill this gap so that people do not wonder which regulation
is superior over the other. The regulatory status must be amended so
that people can trust and approve it without any hesitation. The
regulations like SECURE in the USA help many plant breeders and
companies to achieve small niches in GE crops creation. The government
of different countries should surrogate between developers and the
public to carefully consider the degree of health risk of each crop
variety for which off-targets are also considered. Consumers should also
consider the "right to know" if there is difficulty in acceptance of
these new generation crops. Such endorsements will definitively help
consumers to gradually accept genome-edited crops in near future.

generation) and genetically modified (second generation) crops

Conclusions and future outlook

[Novel genome editing techniques have shifted our focus from the
insertion of protein-coding DNA towards DNA modifying enzymes and
regulatory RNAs]{.underline} \[30\]. **[CRISPR/Cas9 has emerged as one
of the revolutionary editing tools]{.underline}** due to its
unprecedented ability of precise editing, diverse applications, and
minimum off-targets. Advances in gene-editing technologies have made it
popular due to its diverse functions in crop improvement such as
replacement, knock-out, knock-in, and point mutations, at any gene locus
of crops. But at the same time, some questions are raised about its
regulatory framework, especially concerning its integration into the GMO
regulatory framework. **[The best GMO regulatory framework for plant
breeding purposes is the regulatory framework of the USA The USA
regulation has been documented with full optimization from scientific
and social standpoints]{.underline}**. The regulatory framework of
Argentina is also very convincing with the concept of new plant breeding
technology. The economy of India country that is based upon agricultural
practices needs to redraft its regulation for breeders to develop new GE
varieties to feed the 13.9 billion population of the world as soon as
possible. [The most important consideration for GMO is the assessment of
health risks and food safety for all countries]{.underline}. Failing to
adopt the GE technique has a major impact on research and foundations.
Science and technology are heavily influenced by public opinion in many
countries. In terms of genetic crop improvement, a decision in accepting
the NPBTs is the major factor taken into consideration. [Considering the
NPBTs products especially created by the CRISPR/Cas9 technology under
GMO will make the approval process more complicated. This practice will
limit the commercial development of these techniques.]{.underline}
However, exempting the GE varieties and utilization of already approved
genes definitively encourage interesting opportunities for breeders as
well as startup companies, to achieve certain niches in the creation of
GE crops. At this stage, active engagement between developers and the
public is highly needed so that researcher or developers and both
eloquent their research to society and communicate that helps in
eradicating the misconceptions regarding the genome editing technology
in plants. Communication on research should also take place from
beginning to end, with different stages of development \[57\] especially
on the diverse application of these techniques and their effects and
impacts on the public and environmental health. These attainments will
definitively gradually help the consumer to accept genome-edited crops.

### CRISPR---2NC---Disease

#### CRISPR gene editing can treat disease inducing genes, even in previously untreatable conditions. It's safe and effective!

**Ledford 21 -- **Senior Reporter for Nature focused in biology in
Medicine, PhD University of California Berkeley. \[Heidi. "Landmark
CRISPR trial shows promise against deadly disease." Nature. June 29,
2021.\]

**[Preliminary results from a landmark clinical trial suggest that
CRISPR--Cas9 gene editing can be deployed directly into the body to
treat disease.]{.underline}**

The study is the [first to show that the technique can be safe and
effective if the CRISPR--Cas9 components]{.underline} --- [in this case
targeting a protein that is made mainly in the liver --- are infused
into the bloodstream]{.underline}. In the trial, [six people with a rare
and fatal condition]{.underline} called transthyretin [amyloidosis
received a single treatment with the gene-editing therapy. All
experienced a drop in the level of a misshapen protein associated with
the disease.]{.underline} [Those who received the higher of two doses
tested saw levels of the protein]{.underline}, called TTR, [decline by
an **average of 87%.**]{.underline}

CRISPR gene therapy shows promise against blood diseases

The treatment was developed by Intellia Therapeutics of Cambridge,
Massachusetts, and Regeneron of Tarrytown, New York. They published the
trial results in The New England Journal of Medicine1 and presented them
at an online meeting of the Peripheral Nerve Society on 26 June.

[Previous results from CRISPR--Cas9 clinical trials have suggested that
the technique can be used in cells that have been removed from the
body]{.underline}. The cells are edited and then reinfused back into
study participants. **[But to be able to edit genes directly in the body
would open the door to treating a wider range of
diseases]{.underline}**.

"It's an important moment for the field," says Daniel Anderson, a
biomedical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge. "It's a whole new era of medicine."

Treating the untreatable

Transthyretin amyloidosis is caused when molecules of TTR protein fold
into the wrong shape and clump together, forming fibres that interfere
with organ function. The disease principally attacks the heart and
nerves[. A hereditary form of the condition affects about 50,000 people
worldwide; more than 100 mutations in the TTR gene have been linked to
transthyretin amyloidosis.]{.underline}

The [condition can cause heart disease, pain and death, and until
recently there was little that doctors could do to treat
it.]{.underline} "It's an absolutely awful disease," says Julian
Gillmore, a nephrologist at the Royal Free Hospital in London who has
treated people with various forms of amyloidosis for about 25 years. "Up
until a few years ago, I just watched them get worse and die."

[But transthyretin amyloidosis has become a prime target for new medical
technologies that aim to disable disease-causing genes]{.underline}. It
is definitively linked to production of a particular protein --- shut
down production of that protein, and disease symptoms stop progressing
and in some cases reverse.

CRISPR treatment inserted directly into the body for first time

In 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration approved two drugs to treat
transthyretin amyloidosis, both of which reduce the production of TTR by
targeting the messenger RNA that encodes it. But although these drugs
reduce TTR by about 80% and prolong survival, they must be taken
routinely to keep TTR levels down, and do not always halt disease
progression.

Most TTR protein is produced in the liver, an organ that readily soaks
up medicines from the blood. That feature is key: although CRISPR--Cas9
has been hailed as a revolutionary way to treat diseases, it has
limitations. The technique requires a DNA-cutting enzyme, called Cas9,
and a piece of RNA, called a guide RNA, to direct it to the proper place
in the genome. These must be packaged in a way that shields them from
degradation, and must be delivered to the site in the body where they
are needed.

Intellia encased RNA molecules coding the guide RNA and the Cas9 protein
in nanoparticles made of biomolecules called lipids, which can be taken
up by the liver. The guide RNA sends Cas9 to snip the TTR gene; the
cell's DNA-repair processes then mend the break, but often make mistakes
that can disable the gene and halt production of the TTR protein.

[A month after treatment, TTR production was reduced in all
participants. In one person who received the higher of the two tested
doses, it fell by 96%]{.underline} --- a result that Gillmore, who was
an investigator on the trial, finds particularly exciting. Current
treatments can reduce TTR by as much as 80%. But he says that a therapy
that knocks TTR production down further would increase the chance that
his patients' symptoms would stop getting worse --- and might even lead
to improvement.

"When you get to numbers like 96%, that's where you start to give the
body a chance to clean up what has been deposited," says John Leonard,
president of Intellia.

Bone marrow and beyond

Researchers will anxiously await data from more participants, says
Anderson, and will want to know how all the participants fare over a
longer period of time. [But the current results are enough to fuel hope
that CRISPR--Cas9 will one day be able to help treat not only
transthyretin amyloidosis, but other conditions, too.]{.underline}

Quest to use CRISPR against disease gains ground

[Intellia has also shown that it can deliver CRISPR--Cas9 components to
cells in the bone marrow in mice.]{.underline} Leonard says [the company
is keen to develop a method of treating sickle-cell anaemia that doesn't
require the arduous and risky bone marrow transplant used in ongoing
gene-editing trials for the illness]{.underline}.

Another company, Editas Medicine in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has
encoded CRISPR--Cas9 components into a disabled virus. Editas is testing
this in people with a hereditary disorder that causes blindness, but the
virus must be injected directly into the eye, where the gene editing
needs to take place.

**[Techniques for delivering CRISPR--Cas9 components to various parts of
the body are advancing rapidly]{.underline}**, says Anderson. "The list
keeps growing," he says. "I'm optimistic that we're going to see much
broader application of genome editing."

#### CRISPR has a laundry list of applications in genetic diseases. Genetic modification of disease inducing genes is a contingent good.

**[Applications of CRISPR in genetic diseases]{.underline}**

To date, **[CRISPR/Cas systems have been used to investigate target
genes in genome modification, splicing, transcription and epigenetic
regulation, and have been applied in a research setting to investigate
and treat genetic diseases, infectious diseases, cancers, and
immunological diseases]{.underline}** , 30. [Among the exciting
advances, translational use of CRISPR/Cas in monogenic human genetic
diseases has the potential to provide long-term therapy after a single
treatment]{.underline}. In this section, we summarize the recent
applications of the CRISPR/Cas system in the generation of disease
models and in the treatment of genetic diseases in vitro and in vivo.

Disease modeling using CRISPR/Cas

The generation of disease models is necessary for understanding disease
mechanisms and developing new therapeutic strategies. [CRISPR/Cas has
been widely used for creating disease-related cellular models, such
as]{.underline} DMD 31, aniridia-related keratopathy (ARK) 32, [brittle
bone]{.underline} 33, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) 34, [and
Alzheimer\'s disease]{.underline} 35. [Moreover, researchers have
created a series of mouse models using CRISPR/Cas that
recapitulate]{.underline} DMD 36[, atherosclerosis]{.underline} 37,
[obesity and diabetes]{.underline} 38, RTHα 39, [and Alzheimer\'s
disease]{.underline} 40 (Table ​Table11). One example is the development
of a mouse model for ryanodine receptor type I-related myopathies (RYR1
RM), which harbors a patient- relevant point mutation (T4706M)
engineered into one allele, and a 16-base pair frameshift deletion
engineered into the second allele of the RYR1 gene. Subsequent
experiments demonstrated that this mouse model of RYR1 RM is a powerful
tool for understanding the pathogenesis of recessive RYR1 RM, and for
preclinical testing of therapeutic efficacy 41. [CRISPR/Cas has also
been used to generate disease models in large animals, including
sheep]{.underline} 42, rabbit 43, pig 44, [and monkey]{.underline} 45.
For example[, a monkey model was developed to study Parkinson\'s
disease]{.underline} by introducing a PINK1 deletion and revealed a
requirement for functional PINK1 in the developing primate brain 45**[.
CRISPR/Cas technology offers a flexible and user-friendly means of
developing disease models to explore the genetic causes of diseases and
evaluate therapeutic strategies.]{.underline}**

**[Disease correction using CRISPR/Cas in model organisms and clinical
trials]{.underline}**

**[Monogenic diseases affect a large population of
patients]{.underline}**. In the ClinVar database, more than 75,000
pathogenic genetic variants have been identified 19, 46. Here we
summarize recent therapeutic applications of CRISPR/Cas in model
organisms and in clinical trials (Table ​Table22 and Table ​Table33).

[Hemoglobinopathies]{.underline}

[Inherited blood disorders are good candidates for gene therapies
because gene therapy can modify the causative gene in autologous
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and correct the hematopoietic
system.]{.underline} β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease are two
genetic blood diseases. β-thalassemia is due to various mutations
including small insertions, single point mutations or deletions in
β-globin gene, resulting in loss or reduced β-globin synthesis 47.
Sickle cell disease is caused by a Glu-\>Val mutation in β-globin
subunit of hemoglobin 48, 49, leading to abnormal hemoglobin S.
Re-expressing the paralogous γ-globin genes is a universal strategy to
ameliorate both β-globin disorders. The Bauer group applied
CRISPR/Cas-based cleavage of the GATA1 binding site of the erythroid
enhancer. This approach decreases erythroid expression of the γ-globin
repressor BCL11A and in turn increases γ-globin expression. This
strategy is therapeutically practicable to produce durable fetal
hemoglobin induction 50-52 (Table ​Table22).

To date, three clinical trials aiming to treat patients with
β-thalassemia and severe sickle cell disease by transfusion of
CRIPSR/Cas9 edited CD34+ human HSCs (CTX001) have been initiated by
CRISPR Therapeutics in 2018 and Allife Medical Science and Technology
Co., Ltd in 2019 (Table ​Table33).

[Inherited eye disease]{.underline}

[Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is a rare genetic eye disease
manifesting severe vision loss at birth or infancy. LCA10 caused by
mutations in the CEP290 gene is a severe retinal dystrophy]{.underline}.
CEP290 gene (\~7.5 kb) is too large to be packaged into a single AAV. To
overcome this limitation, Editas Medicine developed EDIT-101, a
candidate genome editing therapeutic, to correct the CEP290 splicing
defect in human cells and in humanized CEP290 mice by subretinal
delivery. This approach uses SaCas9 to remove the aberrant splice donor
generated by the IVS26 mutation. In the human CEP290 IVS26 knock-in
mouse model, over 94% of the treated eyes achieved therapeutic target
editing level (10%) when the dose of AAV was not less than 1 × 1012
vg/ml 53. Allergan and Editas Medicine have initiated a clinical trial
of EDIT-101 for the treatment of LCA10 (Table ​Table33).

Autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy (CORD6) is induced by a
gain-of-function GUCY2D mutation. CRISPR/Cas components delivered by AAV
specifically disrupt the early coding sequence of GUCY2D in the
photoreceptors of mice and macaques by NHEJ. This study was the first to
successfully perform somatic gene editing in primates using
AAV-delivered CRISPR/Cas (up to 13% editing efficiency of GUCY2D mutant
gene in macaque photoreceptor), and demonstrated the potential of
CRISPR/Cas to cure inherited retinal diseases 54.

[Muscular genetic disease]{.underline}

[DMD, caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, is the most common
form of progressive muscular dystrophy, and is characterized by muscle
weakness, loss of ambulation, and premature death.]{.underline} [Several
groups have used NHEJ to bypass a premature stop codon in exon 23 and
restore the expression of dystrophin in neonatal and adult mice after
local or systemic delivery of CRISPR/Cas components by AAV 55-57.
Similarly, CRISPR/Cas- induced NHEJ has been used to treat DMD in a DMD
dog model after AAV-mediated systemic delivery of CRISPR gene editing
components]{.underline}. 3 to 90% of dystrophin was recovered at 8 weeks
after systemic delivery in skeletal muscle, the editing efficiency was
dependent on muscle type and the muscle histology was improved in
treated dogs 58. In addition, ABE was delivered locally by intramuscular
injection of a trans-splicing AAV to cure DMD in a mouse model 59. These
studies highlight the potential application of gene editing for the
correction of DMD in patients.

Congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A), one of neuromuscular
disorders, usually appears at birth or infancy. It is mainly featured by
hypotonia, myasthenia and amyotrophy. MDC1A is caused by
loss-of-function mutations in LAMA2, which encodes for laminin-α2. To
compensate for the loss of laminin-α2, Ronald D. Cohn and his colleagues
used CRISPRa to upregulate LAMA1, which encodes laminin-α1 and is a
structurally similar protein to laminin-α2. Upregulation of LAMA1
ameliorates muscle wasting and paralysis in the MDC1A mouse model and
provides a novel mutation-independent approach for disease correction
60.

[Genetic liver disease]{.underline}

[Hereditary tyrosinemia type I (HTI) patients with loss of function FAH
mutations accumulate toxic metabolites that cause liver damage.
CRISPR/Cas- mediated HDR has been used to correct FAHmut/mut in the HTI
mouse model]{.underline} by hydrodynamic injection of plasmids encoding
CRISPR/Cas components or by combined delivery of AAV carrying HDR
template and sgRNA and of nanoparticles with Cas9 mRNA 61, 62. VanLith
et al. transplanted edited hepatocytes with corrected FAH into recipient
FAH-knockout mice and cured HTI mice 63. Song et al. have used ABE in an
adult mouse model of HTI to correct a FAH point mutation 64. In addition
to correcting FAH, several groups have knocked out hydroxyphenylpyruvate
dioxygenase (HPD), which acts in the second step of tyrosine catabolism
and is an upstream enzyme of FAH, to prevent toxic metabolite
accumulation and treat HTI metabolic disease 65.

Patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) develop liver
disease due to a toxic gain-of- function mutant allele, as well as
progressive lung disease due to the loss of AAT antiprotease function.
CRISPR/Cas-mediated NHEJ has been used to disrupt mutant AAT to reduce
the pathologic liver phenotype 66, while HDR has been used to correct an
AAT point mutation 67.

[Congenital genetic lung disease]{.underline}

[Congenital genetic lung diseases include cystic fibrosis and inherited
surfactant protein (SP) syndromes 68. Monogenic lung diseases caused by
mutations in SP genes of the pulmonary epithelium show perinatal lethal
respiratory failure death or chronic diffuse lung disease with few
therapeutic options. Using a CRISPR fluorescent reporter system,
scientists precisely timed intra-amniotic delivery of CRISPR/Cas9
components into a prenatal mouse model with the human SP gene SFTPCI73T
mutation to inactivate mutant SFTPCI73T gene through NHEJ.]{.underline}
Prenatal gene editing in SFTPCI73T mutant mice rescued lung
pathophysiology, improved lung development, and increased survival rate
to 22.8%. For intra- amniotic delivery, the amniotic cavity of embryonic
day 16 mouse fetus, in which fetal breathing movements are optimal for
fetal lung editing, was injected. After prenatal CRISPR delivery,
embryonic day 19 fetus achieved up to 32% SFTPC wild-type airway and
alveolar epithelial cells in SFTPCI73T mice, rescued lung
pathophysiology by immunohistology, improved lung development by
reducing the synthesis of mis trafficked SFTPC mutant proprotein, and
increased survival rate to 22.8% 69.

Cystic fibrosis is another life-threatening monogenic lung disease
caused by mutations in CFTR gene 70. Researchers applied CRISPR to
precisely corrected CFTR carrying homozygous F508 deletion (F508del) in
exon 10 in the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) separated from
cystic fibrosis patients 71 and the overall correction efficiency is up
to 90% using piggyBac transposase as selection marker. Xu group applied
the electroporation of CRISPR/Cas RNP and achieved more than 20%
correction rate in patient-derived iPSC cell line with F508del mutation
72. As expected, CRISPR-induced genetic correction leads to the recovery
of CFTR function in airway epithelial cells or proximal lung organoids
derived from iPSC.

how the influenza virus, a contagious respiratory illness causing up to
650,000 deaths/year]{.underline},26 infects cells and replicates.

death]{.underline}**.27 [CRISPR/Cas9 could be used as either an
antiviral strategy or a genetic screening tool to reduce the prevalence
of diseases such as influenza.]{.underline} [One application of
CRISPR/Cas9 technology that can have a tremendous impact on child health
is the targeted use of CRISPR/Cas9 screening to identify and prevent
influenza virus from replicating]{.underline}.28

Influenza is a widespread virus that is particularly difficult to
eliminate. Seasonal influenzas (e.g. type A, B, C, and D) result in an
estimated 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and about 290,000 to
650,000 deaths each year.29 Severe cases are characterized by severe
illness and hospitalization and are particularly prevalent among
high-risk groups. 99% of deaths due to influenza in children \<5 years
old, occur in developing countries.29 [Researchers have utilized
CRISPR/Cas9 activation technology to identify influenza A virus (IAV)
restriction factors]{.underline}.30 [Their genome-wide overexpression
screening found that an enzyme called B4GALNT2 exhibited inhibitory
activity against every subtype of avian influenza.30 Thus, **CRISPR was
used to discovered a factor that can be utilized to eradicate infection
by avian influenza viruses in humans**]{.underline}.30

[Researchers from the University of Chicago have identified not one, but
two factors that allow the influenza virus to infect lung cells in
humans.31 Their CRISPR/Cas9 genetic screening tool exposed human
epithelial lung cells to the H5N1 flu strain and found two genes
(SLC35A1 and CIC) common among the resistant cells, whose modified
genome became resistant to the virus and was missing a necessary pathway
for the virus to replicate]{.underline} (see Figure 2).31 **[Eliminating
both genes using CRISPR/Cas9 prevented influenza virus
infection]{.underline}**. The gene CIC was also found to be important
for all other strains of flu and various RNA viruses, including
respiratory and non-respiratory viruses.31 **[This approach is not
limited to the influenza virus, but has the potential to be used with a
host of other genes for various viruses.]{.underline}** Next steps
include further research on available drugs that target necessary
replication pathways for influenza or others viruses, so that the drugs
can be repurposed as antiviral treatments.31

Introduction

[CRISPR]{.underline} (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic
repeats) [is an]{.underline} easy to use and [inexpensive gene editing
technology that can be used to make highly precise changes to genetic
sequences in order to protect human health]{.underline}. **[Therapeutic
applications using CRISPR/Cas9 to correct disease-causing mutations are
currently under development to treat cancer and heritable
diseases]{.underline}**, like Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) a
genetic disorder with no cure that causes muscle degeneration and
weakness, and eventual premature death.1--3 [CRISPR-based therapies are
also in pre-clinical development to treat other diseases of single-gene
origin like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia]{.underline}.4,5
However, here we will focus on [non-human applications of CRISPR/Cas9 to
microbes and animals]{.underline} and how **[these strategies could
benefit children's health by reducing the burden of vector-borne
infectious diseases, microbial diseases, and lack of organ donations
globally.]{.underline}**

How CRISPR works

The CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing platform employs small RNA sequences called
guide RNAs to direct the system to matching sequences of DNA. Once the
targeted DNA is located, Cas9, an DNA cutting enzyme, binds to and cuts
the designated DNA to either shut off the targeted gene, add genetic
sequences, or replace the targeted DNA with another sequence.6 CRISPR is
unique because it also enables the engineering of CRISPR-based gene
drives that function to rapidly propagate desired gene edits through
sexually-reproducing plant or animal populations.7,8 Normally, during
sexual reproduction there is only a 50% chance of gene inheritance in
offspring. Thus, if one wanted to genetically alter a wild population to
express a trait that limits an organism's fitness, that gene edit would
eventually become diluted in a wild population due to natural selection.
Even a beneficial trait would take considerable generations, and thus
time, to spread through a population. [CRISPR-based gene drives instead
have the potential to ensure desired genetic alterations can be passed
to all offspring, even if the gene edit causes traits that are
detrimental to an organism like sterility, to quickly spread a desired
gene edit through a species population]{.underline} (see Figure 1).7, 9

Figure 1.

**[Mosquitoes and malaria.]{.underline}**

[CRISPR/Cas9 is different from other gene-editing technologies due to
its use of a gene drive. A gene drive ensures that the altered gene is
always passed on to the next generation]{.underline}, while normal
inheritance results in the population eventually becoming diluted.
**[This method is being used for Anopheles mosquitoes (pictured here)
which transmit malaria.]{.underline}**

Go to:

[CRISPR applications to fight infectious diseases]{.underline}

[Each year more than 700,000 deaths occur due to vector-borne disease
transmission.]{.underline}10 [CRISPR technology has important
implications for]{.underline} children's health by [reducing infectious
diseases by gene editing vectors of disease.]{.underline} Here we will
discuss how **[CRISPR-based strategies could reduce mortality and
morbidity of malaria and Lyme disease for children globally, especially
in the case of malaria since it disproportionately affects children \<5
years old]{.underline}**.11

**[Malaria]{.underline}**

In Africa alone, approximately 285,000 children \<5 years old died from
malaria in 2016,12 and [nearly half a million individuals globally die
from malaria every year]{.underline}.13 [Malaria is]{.underline} a
life-threatening infectious disease that children \<5 years old are most
vulnerable14 and is [transmitted through the bite of an infected
Anopheles mosquito carrying the Plasmodium parasite.]{.underline}15
[Non-governmental organizations]{.underline} and academic institutes,
like Target Malaria**[, are currently working to develop, but have not
yet used, CRISPR-based gene drive strategies to reduce populations of
Anopheles mosquitoes, and thus reduce malaria
transmission]{.underline}**.14 One of Target Malaria's strategies uses
CRISPR to inhibit expression of fertility genes in female Anopheles,
with the aim of reducing the overall population of Anopheles mosquitoes
and consequently malaria transmission.14

Another approach is being developed by scientists at Johns Hopkins
University that utilizes CRISPR/Cas9 on Anopheles mosquitoes to prevent
the activation of the protein (FREP1) necessary for Plasmodium
survival.16 These gene-edited mosquitoes are less likely to carry
Plasmodium parasites, providing an innovative approach to prevent
malaria transmission for humans without impacting mosquito population
size. Other scientists at the University of California experienced
similarly positive results when testing the efficiency of a CRISPR/Cas9
gene-drive system that can spread antimalarial genes into a target
vector population.17 The testing resulted in ≥98% efficiency,17 and
further highlights the potential of a novel technology such as
CRISPR/Cas9 in reducing the health burden of malaria for vulnerable
populations such as children in low-income countries.

**[Lyme Disease]{.underline}**

[Ticks are the vectors responsible for transmitting Lyme disease and
rodents serve as reservoirs]{.underline} for the bacterium Borrelia
burgdorferi bacterium that causes Lyme disease.18 Lyme disease typically
causes fever, fatigue, and a skin rash, and if left untreated, can
spread to joints, the heart, and the nervous system of an infected
individual.18 Lyme disease is most prevalent in the northeast and upper
mid-western parts of the United States (US),19 with approximately
300,000 individuals diagnosed each year. Of these, 25% are children 5--9
years old.[20 Lyme disease has become one of the most rapidly spreading
diseases in the US,21 causing concern among parents regarding their
children's health due to the potential negative effect of pain and
neurological symptoms associated with Lyme disease
infection]{.underline}. **[White-footed mice serve as a primary
reservoir for Lyme disease, which is why scientists are developing
strategies to target white-footed mice to reduce Lyme disease
transmission.]{.underline}**

Researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, including Kevin
Esvelt, are working to eliminate Lyme disease from the island of
Nantucket in Massachusetts, U.S.A.; where over a quarter of inhabitants
have been infected with Lyme disease.21 We should note that Esvelt and
his team are not using gene drives on Nantucket due to public pushback.
Instead, [Esvelt and his team are working with island residents through
their Mice Against Ticks program to develop a CRISPR-based approach to
alter the DNA of white-footed mice to make them immune to Borrelia
burgdorfer]{.underline}i.21 Esvelt's team works closely with local
residents to share relevant information and produce space for public
deliberation in terms of how and if their experiments should proceed.
**[Making the mice immune to Lyme disease should reduce the transmission
of the disease and consequently decrease the amount of individuals
suffering from its harmful effects, such as arthritis, which is the
leading cause of Lyme disease-associated morbidity in the US, affecting
60% of those infected]{.underline}**.22 If field trials on uninhabited
islands are successful then permission would be asked for the release of
gene-edited mice on habited islands in Massachusetts, such as Nantucket
and Martha's Vineyard.21 The potential to eradicate Lyme disease could
offer children the ability to live a healthier life and decreases the
parental worry of children enjoying the outdoors, especially during
summer months.

#### Organ waitlists kill. CRISPR enables xenotransplantation and reduces the gap between organ supply and demand.

[CRISPR and xenotransplantation for children]{.underline}

[CRISPR/Cas9 technology could decrease the shortage of available organ
donations for children in need of liver, kidney, and heart
transplants]{.underline}. **[In the US, 1 in 10 infants \<4 year of age
die while on the liver transplant list.]{.underline}**32 Children aged 1
to 10 year olds are primarily on the waiting list for kidney and liver
donations, followed by heart and infants under the age of one years old
are mostly waiting for liver or heart transplants.33 [Nearly 40% of
children on organ waitlists must wait over a year for a transplant, a
timeframe that immensely taxes child development and overall
health.32]{.underline} Though still in very early stages of preclinical
development, [CRISPR/Cas9 technology could provide an alternative
solution for the organ transplant waitlist by providing the opportunity
of xenotransplantation, transplantation of a non-human organ into a
human.]{.underline}34 **[By making pig organs suitable for
transplantation into human patients, CRISPR/Cas9 could be used to reduce
the significant gap between the number of transplants children need and
available organs that can be used for transplant
donations.]{.underline}**

[Pig are being considered as an organ source for xenotransplantation due
to the ease of breeding and because pig organs are also extremely
similar to human organs in size and anatomy]{.underline}. Yet risks of
porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) and organ rejection have
inhibited the use of xenotransplantation for years. However, a world
without organ shortage is becoming an eventual possibility thanks to
innovative research that employs CRISPR technologies.34 [Using
CRISPR/Cas9, researchers successfully inactivated every PERV expressed
by a porcine primary cell line]{.underline}. This research resulted in
the production of PERV-inactivated pigs, meaning, in theory, that [the
risk of cross-species viral transmission associated with clinical
xenotransplantation could be prevented, thus eliminating one safety
concern associated with clinical xenotransplantation.]{.underline} 35
Scientists at eGenesis, a life sciences company focused on delivering
safe and effective human transplantable cells, used CRISPR/Cas9 to
remove all 62 copies of PERVs from the pig genome.36 In 2017, the first
pig birth without any flu viruses occurred, in which all of its
offspring could be utilized for human organ transplants (see Figure
3).36 [CRISPR/Cas9 technology could potentially allow for the creation
of individual organs for transplant from pig organs, instead of waiting
for a perfect-match human organ to become available.]{.underline}

### Genetic Essentialism---1NC

#### Scientific discussions about genetics can reduce essentialist views that justify eugenics

essentialism and genetics knowledge in support for eugenics and
genetically modified foods." National Library of Medicine. Sept 30,
2021. Doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0257954\]

In line with our preregistered hypotheses**[, the more people knew about
genetics as assessed by our measure of Knowledge about Genetics, the
lower they scored on measures of genetic essentialism,]{.underline}** rs
= -.35 and -.54 for Beliefs in Genetic Determinism and Genetic
Essentialist Tendencies, respectively (ps\>.001). Likewise, as
preregistered, **[those people who knew more about genetics scored lower
on eugenics acceptance]{.underline}**, r = -.48. We also found **[that
knowledge about genetics was negatively correlated with social
dominance]{.underline}**, r = -.40 (ps\>.001), indicating that **[the
more participants knew about genetics the less likely they viewed it as
appropriate for some groups to dominate others]{.underline}**. In
addition, although not preregistered, we found that **[knowledge about
genetics was positively correlated with GMO acceptance]{.underline}**, r
= .24, p \< .001. That is, those [participants who knew more about
genetics tended to have more positive attitudes towards GMOs, a finding
which converges with some other research]{.underline} \[e.g., 26\]. We
also found that political conservatism was positively associated with
genetic essentialist beliefs, social dominance, and eugenic support, but
was negatively associated with attitudes towards genetically modified
foods and with genetics knowledge.

General discussion

The results of these studies show that views on controversial topics
related to genetics are predicted by the ways that people think about
genes. **[Those who essentialize genetic concepts are more likely to
view some groups as being inferior to others, support government eugenic
policies to control who reproduces, and have fears about GMO
foods.]{.underline}** Given that GMO foods are widely viewed as safe by
scientists, and social dominance orientations and eugenic beliefs are
clearly harmful, [genetic essentialist views can have pronounced
costs.]{.underline}

[Genetic essentialism involves an overly simplistic determinism between
genotypes and their associated phenotypes]{.underline} \[see 34\] for a
review); [but genetic effects are far more nuanced and
complex]{.underline} (for thoughtful reviews on this see \[63, 64[\]).
An underappreciation of this complexity may make eugenic ideas more
appealing, leading people to condemn those who are assumed to have
problematic genomes.]{.underline} Likewise[, misunderstandings about
genetics may render GMO foods as more threatening]{.underline}. While
there are many reasons why people are cautious towards GMOs, a part of
people's concerns appears to hinge on GMOs seeming to violate the
natural order of things and of crossing the perceived boundaries of
essences \[17, 25\]. People with less essentialized views about genetics
appear to share fewer of these concerns.

In addition to genetic essentialism, we found that **[knowledge about
genetics also significantly predicted people's views]{.underline}** on
these topics. It is encouraging **[that genetics knowledge was
associated with less essentialist views, weaker support for social
dominance and eugenics, and less negative attitudes towards GMO
foods.]{.underline}** This raises the possibility that some of
**[people's more harmful attitudes may be reduced by appropriate
genetics education]{.underline}**. Indeed, several efforts have revealed
that many of the simplistic and problematic views about genetics can be
reduced by curricula that consciously strive to counter them \[e.g.,
65--68\]. The present research suggests that such efforts might help
people to become more critical of eugenic and social dominance
perspective \[also see 69, 70\], and may lead to become more open to
some of the potential benefits offered by GMO technologies.

#### Research about genetics within debate is good. It forces students to question genetic essentialist narratives and misinformation in informal settings.

Implications for genetics education research

Since most genetics instruction emphasizes basic genetics literacy, and
many genetics education experts advocate for more standard genomics
literacy (and not humane genomics literacy),19,50,119,122 it is possible
that contemporary genetics education does more to increase belief in
genetic essentialism than to decrease it.4 Although no one has directly
tested this hypothesis, [syntheses of research on genetics education
suggest that students bring their genetic essentialist biases into the
classroom]{.underline}.19 Once in the genetics classroom, these biases
interact with similar biases in teachers123 and textbooks19 to further
exacerbate student belief in genetic essentialism.19 [When students
leave the classroom and make sense of genomic information in the media
as adults, research also suggests that their belief in genetic
essentialism grows]{.underline},15,107,118,124, 125, 126 **[especially
when they do not have the appropriate derived literacy to make sense of
such media]{.underline}**.15,19,118 Therefore, the most current evidence
suggests that the system of K--16 genetics education inadequately
inoculates students against belief in genetic essentialism.19 **[A
consequence of this inadequacy is that students probably lack the
ability to identify and critique genetic essentialist messages outside
of school in the media]{.underline}**. This prediction is warranted,
because derived and fundamental literacies bidirectionally affect one
another86 and because genetics education primarily focuses on basic
genetics literacy.

Although this hypothesis is untested, it is consistent with studies of
adults that explore how the public responds to genetic findings in the
media.15,118,124, 125, 126 [Simply put, there is no reason to expect our
youth to develop into adults who disbelieve genetic essentialism if
formal genetics education does not help youth to understand the flaws in
genetic essentialism.]{.underline} Therefore, it should be unsurprising
that some journalists continue to misconstrue the findings of population
genetic studies to advance the argument that racial inequality is
genetic.27,127,128 After all, genetics education rarely teaches students
why they should be skeptical of this claim. [Likewise, it should be
unsurprising that American adults grow in their belief in genetic
essentialism after reading the results of their own genetic ancestry
test or those of others]{.underline}.15,124,125 After all, genetics
education rarely helps students make sense of patterns of human genetic
variation to refute essentialism[. Nor should it be surprising that
white supremacists continue to cloak their racial animus through genetic
arguments about "human biodiversity]{.underline}."129 After all,
genetics education rarely helps students understand how Dobzhansky,
Lewontin, Feldman, and other modern-day population geneticists have
crafted arguments to challenge white supremacy. At best, genetics
education does little to prevent genetic essentialism, and at worst it
indirectly contributes to it through the kind of instruction it offers
to students. While it is defensible to argue that some genetic
essentialists will persist in their beliefs regardless of the genetics
education that is provided to them[, it is indefensible to claim that
genetics education is irrelevant to genetic essentialism.]{.underline}

To better understand if and how genetics education influences broader
social discourses about race in the United States, more research is
needed on the interplay of derived and fundamental genomics literacy.
**[School is not where most American adults learn most of their
science.130 Many adults learn most of their science in informal
settings---the news, the internet, television, movies, and social
media]{.underline}**.130 **[The ability to identify and dismiss
essentialist misinformation in the media is therefore integral to
preventing public belief in genetic essentialism]{.underline}**. Yet, at
the time of this writing (June 18, 2021), a search on google scholar
including the terms "fundamental genomic literacy" or "fundamental
genetic literacy" and "genetic essentialism" yields no publications
matching these termsb. Thus[, we know next to nothing about how students
use genetics knowledge derived within school (i.e., derived genomics
literacy) to comprehend, interpret, analyze, and critique genetic
essentialist messages they encounter outside of school in science
journalism or on social media]{.underline} (i.e., fundamental genomics
literacy[). Research on this relationship is so critical because it will
tell us if and how genetics education leads students to believe in the
genetic misinformation that is spread through social media by white
supremacists as they recruit others to their cause129 or whether it
helps them to criticize such media.]{.underline}

Of course, the previous argument implies that a relationship between
derived and fundamental genomics literacy will be found if we go looking
for it, and that genetics education can influence reasoning outside of
school. Neither of these outcomes is guaranteed, because only 4% of high
school science teachers report that they teach their students
informational reading and writing strategies (i.e., fundamental
literacy),131 and many educational studies have established that people
have difficulty transferring their knowledge across reasoning
contexts.87,132 Given these findings, it would be wise for any research
program on scientific literacy, genetics education, and genetic
essentialism to move beyond a positive test strategy that affirms the
hypotheses laid out in this review. The positive test strategy in
science involves designing studies that produce evidence consistent with
one's hypotheses.133 Most of the studies reviewed above used this
strategy, because it is commonly used when exploring new hypotheses.133

### Genetic Essentialism---2NC

#### Genetic essentialism produces a reductive and eugenic view of race and difference, but new epistemologies of genetic research can deconstruct bias

**Donovan 21 --** Senior Research Scientist at BSCS Science Learning,
PhD in Science Education from Stanford University. \[Brain M. "Ending
genetic essentialism through genetics education." HGG Advances. Oct 14,
2021. Doi: 10.1016/j.xhgg.2021.100058\]

The importance of genomics literacy in the development of genetic
essentialism

[Some adults believe that genetic essentialism is a self-evident,
commonsensical, and objective way to view race]{.underline}.5 One reason
why such adults make this error is because **[genetic essentialism of
race is a form of a more widespread bias called psychological
essentialism]{.underline}**. [Psychological essentialism is the belief
that each living category]{.underline} (e.g., species, race, or gender[)
has an immutable and objective reality that cannot be observed
directly]{.underline} (i.e., an essence) because it is internal to
category members.59 This essence is believed to be responsible for the
respective similarities and differences within and between categories.59
Consequently[, a belief in essences leads people to infer that
categories have an inductive potential, which, in turn, helps them to
make predictions about how unknown individuals of a certain category
will behave]{.underline} (e.g., stereotypes).59

[Psychological essentialism emerges early in human
development]{.underline},59 and although it has been observed in several
cultures,60,61 there is no direct genetic evidence that it is an
inherited traita. Instead, **[several lines of evidence demonstrate that
it is altered through language,6 culture, and schooling]{.underline}**.
A current working hypothesis is that psychological essentialism is built
upon simpler cognitive biases (some of which may be innate) and that
culture highly constrains the development of it.69 For example, young
children (i.e., age 4--5 years) in different cultures are known to
essentialize animal and gender categories,64,70 but there is
cross-cultural variation in the timing of when children begin to
essentialize racial or ethnic categories.61,63,64,71, 72, 73, 74 As far
as we know, children (i.e., ages 3--5 years) in the United States tend
not to conceptualize race in psychological essentialist terms64 like
adults do.5 Psychological essentialism of race develops at different
ages in the United States (and elsewhere) because of differential
exposure to cultural content, and ethnic outgroups. Altogether[,
psychological essentialism of race appears to be more dependent on
cultural input than essentialism of non-human categories or
gender.]{.underline}63,64

[During school, US children grow in their tendency to essentialize race
and they begin to develop a belief in genetic essentialism of
race]{.underline}. For instance, between the ages of 5 and 10 years,
evidence suggests that US elementary schoolers stop thinking of racial
identity as subjective and flexible and they begin to think of it as
natural and stable.63,64 Although European American children exhibit
these changes later in childhood than African American children do,
[racial essentialism becomes a stronger predictor of racial stereotyping
in European American children during the course of elementary school as
they realize that race is a salient concept for understanding
society.65,67 Then, in middle school, when most students are formally
introduced to Mendelian genetics during their science classes,77
adolescents begin to believe that essences are genetic]{.underline}.66
For example, adolescence is when people begin to favor genetic
explanations for racially stereotyped traits like intelligence and
athleticism rather than the environment or choice.66

By the end of high school, US teenagers who attend rural and relatively
homogeneous schools are more likely to essentialize race than those who
attend schools in diverse cities.64 However, [the negative relationship
between exposure to racial diversity and belief in genetic essentialism
in European American high schoolers may be moderated by parental
education]{.underline},75 as this negative relationship does not appear
to exist among adolescents parented by non-college-educated
caretakers.75 Such moderation is probably due to the fact that exposure
to racial diversity during college is associated with a reduction in
belief in genetic essentialism in the European American undergraduate
population.76 Therefore, K--16 schools may be a cultural context that
promotes or prevents the development of psychological essentialism of
race in the United States.65,67

[Some scholars further argue that genetics education is a factor within
schools that gives psychological essentialism a genetic
"flavor."]{.underline}4,18,19 Upon first analysis, it seems strange that
an education in biology would have this effect. After all, genetic
essentialism is a scientifically inaccurate view of intraspecific
variation,4,6,19,78, 79, 80 and several studies have found that belief
in species essentialism is positively correlated with misunderstandings
of intraspecific variation and natural selection in children,81,82
undergraduates,79 and adults.82,83 A biology educator committed to the
scientific literacy of their students should therefore view genetic
essentialism as problematic for learning because it is antithetical to
evolutionary thinking. Consequently, a scientifically literate biology
student should understand why genetic essentialism is genetically
flawed. Yet, even though scientific literacy has long been a goal of
science education reforms,84,85 belief in genetic essentialism persists
in US society. Why is this the case?

To answer this question, [the concept of scientific literacy and its
relationship to genetic essentialism needs to be examined in detail in
the context of genetics education.]{.underline} Scientific literacy can
be understood in two different senses: the fundamental sense and the
derived sense.86 [Reading and writing about scientific content is the
fundamental sense of scientific literacy, and being knowledgeable about
science is the derived sense of scientific literacy]{.underline}.**[86
While these two senses are distinctly different cognitive performances,
they are intimately related, because knowledge production in science
depends heavily on the production and consumption of
texts]{.underline}**.86

[Fundamental literacy refers to the linguistic skills that individuals
use to comprehend, interpret, analyze, and critique information in a
scientific text.86 Derived literacy, on the other hand, refers to the
scientific knowledge that readers and writers of science use when
consuming or producing information in a science text]{.underline}.86
Knowledge is called derived literacy, because people can derive
scientific knowledge by reading a scientific text.86 This means that
individuals who possess greater comprehension, interpretation, analysis,
and critical reading skills (i.e., fundamental literacy) are more likely
to construct an accurate understanding of the concepts and phenomena
described by a science text (i.e., derived literacy).86 Conversely, the
comprehension, interpretation, analysis, and critique of information in
a scientific text (i.e., fundamental literacy) depends heavily on
whether a person has the prior knowledge to make sense of the
information described by a text (i.e., derived literacy).87,88

From this perspective, [fundamental genomics literacy is the ability to
comprehend, interpret, analyze, and critique information in a genetics
text, and derived genomics literacy is the genetic knowledge that
facilitates this ability and ensues from it.]{.underline} This review
summarizes research on the relationship between derived genomics
literacy and genetic essentialism. It finishes by arguing for a need for
more research on fundamental genomics literacy and genetic essentialism,
because this body of research is nonexistent, yet critical to preventing
the spread of white supremacy in the United States.

[Derived genomics literacy can be broken down into]{.underline} the
particular kinds of knowledge that students possess about genetics,
which includes [ontological and epistemic knowledge]{.underline}. [Human
genetic ontology broadly refers to the kinds of genetic phenomena that
exist in humans and how these phenomena relate to, or cause, one
another.89 Genetic epistemology broadly refers to the many different
ways scientists have produced knowledge about human genetic ontology, as
well as the strengths and limitations of this knowledge.]{.underline}90
Since there are several different ontologies and epistemologies in human
genetics research,91, 92, 93, 94 since scientific concepts are used as
tools to solve particular problems,95 and since educators have different
purposes for teaching science,85 [different combinations of ontologies,
epistemologies, and purposes create different conceptions of derived
genomics literacy**. These conceptions, in turn, have different
relationships with genetic essentialism.**]{.underline} The three
conceptions that are the focus of this review are basic genetics
literacy, standard genomics literacy, and humane genomics literacy.16
The evidence reviewed below suggests that biology education does more to
strengthen belief in genetic essentialism than to weaken it, because it
is oriented toward basic genetics literacy and not humane genomics
literacy. Table 1 outlines examples of the content that could be learned
when developing each of these different conceptions of derived genomics
literacy.

#### Basic genetics education fails to deconstruct biases. In depth research, debates, and exposure to complexity are good.

The influence of basic genetics instruction on belief in genetic
essentialism

[Evidence suggests that certain ontological content in the basic
genetics curriculum could contribute to the development of genetic
essentialism through the causal reasoning and social categorization
mechanisms of genetic essentialism theory.]{.underline} Therefore,
[basic genetics instruction appears to be the wrong tool for reducing
belief in genetic essentialism.]{.underline} Experiments have shown that
reading basic genetics texts that include the blueprint metaphor for
DNA106 and those that include "gene for" language107 cause elevated
levels of genetic essentialism in adults because of changes in causal
reasoning about genes related to specificity, proximity, and stability
beliefs.11,16 Several other qualitative studies with students also
support this hypothesis.19,108 Yet, there is also correlational evidence
that adults with fewer basic genetics misconceptions are less likely to
believe in genetic essentialism,14 and a study that explored the
relationship between relatively high-quality basic genetics instruction
and belief in genetic essentialism in adolescents found no relationship
between the two.16 Therefore, learning about basic genetics concepts may
not be the problem. Rather, **[ineffective basic genetics instruction
that fails to redress a student's genetic misconceptions may increase
the risk that a student develops a greater belief in genetic
essentialism.]{.underline}**

A further escalation of this risk could occur when basic genetics
instruction includes a discussion of racial difference. Three randomized
controlled trials18,54,55 have demonstrated that when secondary biology
students (i.e., middle and high school) learn from a curriculum
describing the prevalence of monogenic disorders in different racial
groups---a canonical basic genetics literacy phenomenon---it causes them
to believe in genetic essentialism more. For example, Donovan54 compared
8th grade students (n = 43) who learned about genetic disease prevalence
(e.g., sickle cell anemia) in different races to those who learned about
it without race. He found that the group who learned with the racialized
learning materials was significantly more likely to believe that races
differed in their genetic potential for intelligence, science ability,
and academic ability.54 Students inferred that if each race has its own
disease, then each race must be genetically uniform, which makes races
differ in many other ways because of their "unique" genotypes (i.e.,
discreteness beliefs). In two more double-blinded randomized controlled
trials, Donovan then replicated these findings with 7th--9th grade
students in biology classrooms.18,55 These studies show that when basic
genetics instruction discusses racial difference, it can unintentionally
increase belief in genetic essentialism among adolescent-aged students
by interacting with beliefs implicated in social categorization.

Altogether, [this literature suggests that belief in genetic
essentialism will be increased when genetics educators discuss race in
conjunction with ineffective basic genetics instruction]{.underline}
that uses inappropriate language (i.e., "gene for") and metaphors (i.e.,
DNA as a blueprint rather than a recipe). Educational experts argue that
this is the modal approach to secondary and undergraduate genetics
education.19,97 For example, the sciences of quantitative genetics and
population/evolutionary genetics, which add complexity to the simpler
stories of basic genetics literacy, tend to be described in a single
chapter at the end of undergraduate genetics textbooks,109 and they tend
to be absent from high school texts.19 Moreover, biology textbooks
around the world tend to use gene-determinist concepts and language when
describing genes.50,110, 111, 112, 113 And, the majority of American
texts also discuss racial differences in the prevalence of genetic
diseases.4,49,53

[When this modal approach to genetics education is combined with the
many cognitive demands of learning genetics, it becomes clear that basic
genetics instruction is the wrong tool for reducing belief in genetic
essentialism]{.underline}. Genetics is difficult to learn because it
requires students to reason about the influence of genes across the
cellular, organismal, and population levels.98 Yet, [many studies have
found that students enter and leave basic genetics instruction without
being able to reason genetically across these levels.19 And, they also
leave with their deterministic misconceptions intact]{.underline}.19
Part of the reason for this problem is that basic genetics instruction
is often ineffective in helping students to integrate the models of
molecular and Mendelian genetics,114,115 and it does not help students
understand population-level variation in complex traits16. These
failures of basic genetics instruction mean that students have
difficulty understanding protein synthesis and the influence of proteins
in the bodies of organisms.98 It also means that students develop little
knowledge about how the environment gets into the body to moderate gene
expression by interacting with proteins.116 [If basic genetics
instruction does not help students to reason across all levels of
biological organization]{.underline} (i.e., cellular, organismal,
population[) to construct a multifactorial explanation of human
difference, then why would it help students to disbelieve genetic
essentialism]{.underline}?

The influence of standard genomics instruction on belief in genetic
essentialism

Correlational and comparative studies on the relationship between
standard genomics literacy and genetic essentialism yield inconsistent
results. For example, in a sample of 427 Brazilian undergraduates,
Gericke et al.117 found that standard genomics literacy was not
correlated with belief in genetic determination. Yet, Donovan et al.17
found that standard genomics literacy had a weak, but statistically
significant, and negative, relationship with belief in genetic
essentialism in a geographically diverse sample of American high
schoolers (n = 721, 9th--12th grade). With regard to comparative
studies, Jamieson and Radick108 used a quasi-experimental design to
explore if British undergraduates (n = 56) learning from a basic
genetics curriculum or a standard genomics curriculum differed in gene
determinist beliefs about human ability, a key component of the causal
reasoning mechanism. Although their study was limited because of
selection bias of participants into different treatment conditions,
students did not differ in belief in genetic determinism before
treatment. Yet afterward the [students who learned from the standard
genomics curriculum had significantly lower average belief in
determinism on the posttest compared to the pretest, whereas those who
learned from the basic genetics curriculum exhibited no significant
pre-post change]{.underline}. Although the researchers argued that the
learning conditions caused these effects, selection bias, measurement
problems, and issues with the quality and transparency of their
statistical analyses (e.g., insufficient reporting of statistics and
conflating a within-subjects change with a between-condition effect)
make this conclusion somewhat tenuous.

A reliably negative relationship between standard genomics instruction
and belief in genetic essentialism is also tenuous, because at least one
randomized trial has found that exposure to standard genomics
information can increase belief in genetic essentialism in adults with
low biology knowledge.118 For example, Morin-Chassé118 explored if
belief in genetic essentialism in adults (n = 965) was affected after
reading a text that explained that genes and the environment each
influence human behaviors and that genes are a better explanation for
intrapopulation variation than interpopulation variation. This is
basically the content outlined in Table 1 under the column on
multifactorial genetics. Morin-Chassé118 compared this treatment text to
a control text that included no genetic information and found that
adults with biology bachelor's degrees in the control and treatment
conditions did not differ in their post-experimental belief in genetic
essentialism. Yet adults without biology bachelor's degrees in the
treatment condition had significantly greater belief in genetic
essentialism than those without such degrees in the control
condition.118 [This result is consistent with the claim that the
standard genomics text increased belief in genetic essentialism among
participants who lacked the appropriate prior knowledge to understand
it.]{.underline}

 https://doi.org/10.1007/s11248-019-00118-5\]

Method

An online survey was conducted between January and April 2018 to gather
expert opinions on potential benefits of NBTs. The **[survey was emailed
to a panel of 507 international experts]{.underline}** (scientists,
government officials, agribusiness professionals, etc.) **[with related
backgrounds and experience in biotechnology]{.underline}**. **[The
survey instrument is part of a multi-year survey project investigating
expert opinions regarding the application of NBTs and their potential to
enhance global food security]{.underline}**. The expert panel was
obtained from a contact database that was constructed using emails of
participants for a number of conferences on biotechnology organized by
the researchers over the past 15 years, and of experts from online
searches (i.e. websites of universities, research institutions, biotech
companies and government agencies). This panel allowed us to reach a
large number of international experts in the field of study.

Our study (BEH 97) was deemed exempt from full ethics review by the
Behavioural Ethics Board at the University of Saskatchewan on April 7,
2015, on the basis that the participants, as experts, were not
themselves the focus of the research.Footnote1 Nevertheless, our online
survey presented participants with a standard consent statement
describing the study, identifying the absence of known risks associated
with participation, and a reminder that participation was voluntary and
responses would be anonymous and confidential. Upon expression of
consent, participants were presented with the survey.

The survey included three opinion-based questions. The first and second
questions were phrased as short statements, soliciting responses on a
five-point Likert scale. [Respondents were invited to provide their
agreement with a list of different potential benefits of genome-edited
crops compared to GM and CONV alternatives]{.underline}, along with
their confidence level on a five-point Likert scale (1 being least
confident and 5 being most confident). [Benefits of genome-edited crops
were measured using 15 agronomic, environmental, and socio-economic
factors]{.underline}. We acknowledge that these benefits can be achieved
'theoretically' by any of these three technologies, however, feasible
outcomes of some techniques are restricted by regulatory burden, high
costs, lengthy process and low consumer acceptance. The third question
asked about the anticipated significance (i.e. minor, moderate or major)
of a number of potential regulatory events in influencing where and how
genome editing will be developed and used in agriculture.

At the end of the survey, a hypothetical binary choice question was
asked to test for temporal preferences (using a lottery prize).
Participants were asked how they would use an imaginary prize of \$5000:
for a summer vacation or for retirement saving. The question was used to
compare the benefits-related questions between two groups of experts:
those who tend to exhibit long- versus short-term preferences. This
question was used only for classification purposes and it is not
intended as a substitute for theoretical discounting models. It was
useful in the context of our study to have a simple, univariate measure
of discounting that was not tied to any specific theoretical
framework.Footnote2

Results and analysis

The survey was completed by 114 respondents, resulting in a response
rate of 22.5%. The sample is dominated by male subjects (79%), aged
between 45 and 65 years (70%). Fifty-three percent of participants
reside in North America, 28% in Europe, and the remainder from the rest
of the world (4% from Africa, 6% from Asia, 4% from Oceania and 5% from
Central and South America). Sixty-three percent identified themselves as
scientists and 37% as non-scientists (government officials, agribusiness
delegates, etc.). Forty percent work for industry, 26% for university,
and 20% for government.

As clarified earlier, not all genome-edited crops fall into the same
category[. Results of previous surveys within this project show that
expert decision makers agree that some genome-edited crops are
transgenic and thus should be regulated as GM while others should
not]{.underline} (Lassoued et al. 2018). Having this result in mind, the
analysis below compares site-specific genome-edited crops (free from
foreign DNA) to GM and CONV counterparts. On average, the mean level of
benefits of genome-edited crops compared to GM (CONV) alternatives was
3.6 (3.75) with a standard deviation (SD) of .73 (.73) on the
one-to-five scale. This reveals that **[experts largely agree on the
potential benefits of genome-edited crops in terms of agronomic
performance (disease resistance, drought tolerance, high yields, etc.),
final product quality (nutrition, shelf life, etc.), climate change
resilience, and global food security]{.underline}** (Table 1). More than
half of the sample was undecided (neutral or cannot tell) about the
impact of genome-edited crops on environmental sustainability (e.g.
reduced agri-food waste, enhanced biodiversity) and economic advantages
for farmers (i.e. higher returns). As for the impact of genome-edited
crops on consumer confidence, environmental footprint and trade, a
plurality tends to be neutral or cannot tell at 46%, 45% and 44%,
respectively.

Table 1 Expert opinions of impact of genome editing compared to GM and
CONV (N = 114)

Full size table

Similarly, the majority of experts believe that **[genome editing offers
more opportunity than CONV to produce crops with improved agronomic
performance, product quality, farmer profitability]{.underline}** (lower
production cost, higher income), **[climate resilience, and global food
security]{.underline}**. [These advantages are derived from the accuracy
and precision of genome-editing technology that some say could help save
years of development time and lower the cost to produce certain traits
in crops]{.underline}. Yet, opinions on socio-political and
environmental questions are less consistent. While 68% of the
participants agree/strongly agree that genome editing will enable
breeders to lower agriculture's environmental footprint, the sample is
divided into those who are optimistic that genome editing could be more
effective than CONV breeding in creating varieties that would reduce
agri-food waste (49%) and enhance biodiversity (39%) and those who are
neutral (41% and 42%). Experts are also divided about whether
genome-edited crops will enhance consumer confidence or open foreign
market access: 35% and 34% think it will not help at all and 40% and 34%
are uncertain. Only about a quarter of the sample (26%) agree/strongly
agree that genome-edited crops might help resolve trade restrictions and
enhance consumer confidence. Genome editing is still a relatively new
technology. Like any innovation, its effects are still somewhat
speculative. Many panelists commented that while existing
biotechnologies can deliver similar benefits to genome-edited crops,
products of genome editing might gain better socio-political advantages.

Overall, [**experts converged on a consensus that genome editing would
offer better agronomic performance and product quality than the
alternatives**. Yet this does not imply that genome-editing technology
is the ideal substitute for GM and CONV breeding techniques---they can
and probably will coexist. GM and CONV still deliver important benefits,
but genome editing would appear to deliver certain benefits better and
faster thanks to its precision (]{.underline}advanced knowledge in
genomics) and the potential lower regulatory oversight. Innovative plant
breeding does not necessarily mean abandoning earlier breeding methods
as different technologies might perform better than others for different
breeding targets. For instance, the GM approach, despite being less
precise, has the potential to perform better than genome editing to
control certain viruses (see e.g. Ali et al. 2016; Lassoued et al.
2018). Yet, GM technology has been facing several regulatory and social
barriers that limited the agronomic (and subsequently socio-economic)
potential in rice and wheat, the world's most important staple grains.

Genetically modified crops: a genome editing approach

GM crops were first commercialized in 1996 and by 2018 the area under
cultivation has increased 113 times and is still growing. In the current
scenario, [GM crops are projected to grow in the marketplace over the
next decade. These crops appeared to be the fastest adopted crop in the
history of modern agriculture with reduced pesticide use]{.underline}
\[9\]. Initially, GM crops such as insect-resistant Bt-cotton and
pest-resistant crops were introduced for commercial cultivation. [These
crops are beneficial for the growers due to their better yield. In
preference to consumer's benefit, some crops like golden rice,
containing high content of beta-carotene, and GM maize, in which
ascorbate level has been improved to prevent scurvy diseases are
introduced for large scale cultivation]{.underline} \[10\]. The **[GM
crops are also very influential in reducing diseases like heart disease,
cancer, and obesity]{.underline}** \[9\]. The high oleic soybean oil
that is commercially available through two companies, namely "Visitive
Gold" from Bayer and "Plenish" from DowDuPont, has been found to be
beneficial for persons with cardiac-related diseases in the USA
Regarding regulation of GM crops, most countries are committed to risk
assessment following the substantial equivalence law proposed by the
Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), Economic Cooperation and
Development (ECD), World Health Organization (WHO), and some similar
organizations. But the assessment is majorly considered inefficient for
detecting the inadvertent effects of GM crops on the environment. In
most cases, the health risk is the major disapproving factor for the
commercialization of GM crops in many countries including India. It is
stated that the development of high profiling techniques for evaluation
can minimize unintended effects. **[The rapid progress in new generation
gene-editing technologies like the CRISPR-cas9, TALEN, and ZFNs can make
genetic modification more precise, and decrease the chances of
undesirable mutations to reduce the health risk.]{.underline}**

Gene editing is viewed as the second-generation technique with the
latest is the CRISPR-Cas9 system. The idea behind this system is based
on the bacterial immunity mechanism against invading viruses. The
CRISPR-Cas system forms double-strand breaks that are repaired either by
the homologous recombination or by the non-homologous end-joining
cellular repair system. Also, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been
experimentally validated for deletion or insertion with precise
targeting \[4\] . Generally, genome editing techniques are divided into
three major categories as represented in Table 1. [In traditional GM
crops, the first generation has been developed by using different
genetic components of plant pests including Cauliflower mosaic virus and
Agrobacterium tumefactions for insertion of the gene of interest. In
contrast, in the approach of edited plants with the CRISPR-Cas9 and
other nucleases, it has been claimed that these are without any pest
sequences]{.underline} (free of transgenes). In continuation, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) has excluded several edited plants from
the category of regulation of GM crops and allowed them to be marketed
without pre-market field review as necessary for GM crops. **[As a
whole, with more exemptions from GMO regulations, this revolutionary
technique can be used for innovation in diverse fields,]{.underline}**
with more public acceptance.

The Crispr-Cas9 genome editing system

A genome editing technology provides a platform for the characterization
of different key regulatory genes of diverse functions and utilizes the
generated information for improvement in crops by targeting multiple
areas of research. Among genome editing tools, the
**[CRISPR]{.underline}** (Clustered regulated interspaced short
palindromic repeat) **[and cas9]{.underline}** (CRISPR-associated
protein 9**[) have emerged as a versatile tool for the introduction of
targeted variations like gene insertions, deletions, replacements, and
single base pair conversion into selected crops at a specific
locatio]{.underline}**n. Two different independent research teams
discovered that CRISPR sequence and Cas protein work together for
precise editing in the genome of living organism. This technology is
mimicked from the prokaryotic adaptive immune mechanism in bacteria and
archaea against the virus by cleaving the invader's genome. Based on the
composition of CRISPR locus, this system has been divided into two
classes as Class 1 requires multiple effector proteins having subtypes
I, III, and IV while class 2 requires only a single effector protein
having subtypes II, V, and VI. The CRISPR-Cas 9 system belongs to class
II and has two main components named Cas endonucleases and guide RNA
(gRNA). Also, CRISPR-Cas9 has two distinct domains, named RuvC and HNH,
for RNA-guided double-stranded DNA recognition and cleavage. The gRNA is
a gene-specific sequence and is twenty-nucleotides long \[11\]. Due to
complementarity, each gRNA binds to a DNA sequence ending with
5′-NGG-3′, and this site is called protospacer adjacent motif (PAM).
This motif is found in three base pairs downstream of the Cas9
endonuclease cleavage site and is crucial for the binding of Cas9
\[12\]. Also, a \~ 80 nucleotide long gRNA scaffold sequence, present
adjacent to the 3′ end, is required for Cas9 binding \[13\]. After the
formation of the gRNA-Cas9 complex, Cas9 forms a double-stranded cut at
three base pairs before the PAM sequence \[14, 15\]. These breaks are
repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed
repair (HDR) which cause insertion of up to a single base and deletion
of up to 100 bases. Multiple sites can be targeted at the same time
using multiple gRNA targeting different targets.

The action of CRISPR-Cas9 is divided into three stages as adaptation,
expression, and interference \[16\]. At the adaptation stage, a Cas
integrase incorporates nucleic acid sequences as spacers, in the CRISPR
array. At the expression or biogenesis stage, a precursor transcript
generated from the CRISPR array is cleaved in the repeat sequence to
form processed the CRISPR RNAs. These crRNAs contain a spacer and a
minimum of one portion of the repeat sequence. In the interference
stage, crRNA-guided Cas complexes recognize a specific site on target
nucleic acids through complementary base pairing. This triggers Cas
enzyme-catalyzed target cleavage \[17\].

[This technique has provided a basis for editing plants and engineering
traits that help them to resist different stress conditions and
nutrition improvement]{.underline}. Another class that contains Cpf1
endonuclease (CRISPR from Prevotella and Francisella1) has recently
proven to be a better alternative for the CRISPR/Cas9. It will work with
only one type of RNA (crRNA) that binds upstream to PAM and cleave DNA
adjacent to short T-rich PAM (5′-TTTN-3′) and have only RuvC domain
\[18\]. [It provides fewer errors with controlled insertions due to its
sticky ends. It has also increased target gene insertion up to 8%. Using
this technique, various genetic manipulations including live-cell
imaging, controlling gene expression, and mutation pattern in the genome
can be carried out]{.underline} \[19\]. CRISPR-mediated editing reagents
including DNA, RNA, and ribonucleoprotein (RNPs) are delivered through
Agrobacterium, particle bombardment, and protoplast mediation in the
plant cells. [Plant transformations rely on plasmids and mRNA-based
expression, leading to gene disruption, potential off-site cutting, and
potential mosaicism. These undesired changes can be overcome by DNA free
genome-editing system using the CRISPR-Cas RNP complex in
plants.]{.underline} RNPs are intact complexes consists of in-vitro
transcribed gRNA and purified Cas9 protein. These RNPs can be used to
deliver directly as functional complexes. Various vector-free techniques
are used to transport the CRISPR-Cas9 RNPs into protoplasts including
electroporation, microinjection, liposome-mediated, and polyethylene
glycol-mediated transformation. In recalcitrant protoplasts, mesoporous
silica nanoparticles and cell-penetrating peptides are used to transfer
the constructs directly into the plant cells. The biolistic delivery of
the Cas-gRNA RNP complexes was reported first time in maize embryo cells
and that generated fertile plants with both mutated and edited alleles.
These RNP complexes have the advantage of stimulating mutation
frequencies in a precise manner over DNA vectors and also these
complexes are cleared instantly by a degradation pathway that reduces
the time for off-target activity \[20[\]. The RNP strategy has been
applied in several plant species including wheat, maize, and
potato]{.underline} \[20,21,22,23**[\]. There is tremendous potential in
the CRISPR technology and further, it can also be used for selective
transcription or selective inhibition of transcription in DNA
segments.]{.underline}**

Abstract

This paper estimates some of the key environmental impacts associated
with using crop biotechnology (specifically genetically modified crops)
in global agriculture. It focuses on the environmental impacts
associated with changes in pesticide use and greenhouse gas **[emissions
arising from the use of GM crops since their first widespread commercial
use in 1996. The adoption of GM insect resistant and herbicide tolerant
technology has reduced pesticide spraying by 775.4 million kg (8.3%)
and, as a result, decreased the environmental impact associated with
herbicide and insecticide use on these crops]{.underline}** \[as
measured by the indicator, the Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ**[)\]
by 18.5%.]{.underline}** The [technology has also facilitated important
cuts in fuel use and tillage changes, resulting in a significant
reduction in the release of greenhouse gas emissions from the GM
cropping area]{.underline}. In 2018, **[this was equivalent to removing
15.27 million cars from the roads.]{.underline}**

7.1 Introduction

GM crop technology has been widely used for more than 20 years in a
number of countries and is mainly found in the four crops of canola,
maize, cotton and soybean. [In 2018, crops containing this type of
technology accounted for 48% of the global plantings of these four
crops.]{.underline} In addition, small areas of GM sugar beet (adopted
in the USA and Canada since 2008), papaya (in the USA since 1999 and
China since 2008), alfalfa (in the US initially in 2005--2007 and then
from 2011), squash (in the USA since 2004), apples (in the USA since
2016), potatoes (in the USA since 2015) and brinjal (in Bangladesh since
2015) have been planted.

[The main traits so far commercialised convey]{.underline}:

[Tolerance to specific herbicides]{.underline} (notably to glyphosate
and to glufosinate and since 2016 tolerance to additional active
ingredients like 2,4-D and dicamba) in maize, cotton, canola (spring
oilseed rape), soybean, sugar beet and alfalfa. This GM Herbicide
Tolerant (GM HT) technology [allows for the 'over the top' spraying of
GM HT crops with these specific broad-spectrum herbicides, that target
both grass and broad-leaved weeds but do not harm the crop
itself;]{.underline}

[Protection against/resistance to specific insect pests of maize,
cotton, soybeans and brinjal]{.underline}. This GM insect
protected/resistance (GM IR), or 'Bt' [technology offers farmers
protection/resistance in the plants to major pests]{.underline} such as
stem and stalk borers, earworms, cutworms and rootworm in maize,
bollworm/budworm in cotton, caterpillars in soybeans and the fruit and
shoot borer in brinjal. Instead of applying a broad-spectrum insecticide
for pest control, an insecticide, far more specific (usually to an
insect level) and recognised as safe for humans and other animals is
delivered via the plant itself through 'Bt' gene expression.

In addition, the GM papaya and squash referred to above are resistant to
important viruses (e.g., ringspot in papaya), the GM apples are
non-browning and the GM potatoes (planted in 2016) have low asparagine
(low acrylamide which is a potential carcinogen) and reduced bruising.

[This paper presents an assessment of some of the key environmental
impacts associated with the global adoption of these GM
traits.]{.underline} The environmental impact analysis focuses on:

[Changes in the amount of insecticides and herbicides applied to the GM
crops relative to conventionally grown alternatives and;]{.underline}

[The contribution of GM crops towards reducing global Greenhouse Gas
(GHG) emissions.]{.underline}

It is widely accepted that increases in atmospheric levels of greenhouse
gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are detrimental
to the global environment (see for example, Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change 2006). Therefore, **[if the adoption of crop
biotechnology contributes to a reduction in the level of greenhouse gas
emissions from agriculture, this represents a positive development for
the world.]{.underline}**

GM crops

In 1953, the molecular structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the
chemical carrier of genetic information, was published (Watson and Crick
1953). Just over two decades later, Cohen et al. (1973) described the
method with which functional foreign DNA could be inserted into another
organism. This breakthrough became the foundation of genetic
modification, arguably one of the most important recent developments in
science, especially to modern agriculture. Thus far, genetic
modification has primarily been used to introduce foreign DNA into
target crops to make them insect resistant or herbicide tolerant, with
these two traits often being 'stacked' (ISAAA 2017).

Globally, [over the past two decades GM crops have provided farmers in
adopting countries an array of economic, environmental, and health
benefits]{.underline} (Smyth et al. 2015). [**GM crops have contributed
significantly to the reduction of environmental impacts from herbicide
and insecticide use.** Since 1996, the use of pesticides on the GM crop
area has decreased by 671.4 million kg of active ingredient]{.underline}
relative to the amount expected had conventional crops been employed on
the same area (Brookes and Barfoot 2018). In addition, relative to
conventional crops[, 2945 million kg of carbon dioxide have not been
released into the atmosphere, because of the fuel saved from fewer runs
needed to spray GM insect-resistant maize and cotton]{.underline}
(Brookes and Barfoot 2018). Despite this, for a diversity of reasons,
some still regard the technology with suspicion, thus giving cause for
greater technological regulatory delays and more barriers to
international trade, which usually result in forgone benefits (Smyth
2017b). To a certain extent societal [concerns regarding the safety of
food derived from GM crops is understandable, given the public's limited
knowledge]{.underline} (Popek and Halagarda 2017). It would be overly
optimistic, to expect the general public to be able to differentiate
between GM and genome-edited crops in the absence of transparent
information or public education efforts. Furthermore[, the
politicization of risk has created a divergence of regulatory
approaches:]{.underline} **[the major crop exporting
nations]{.underline}** (e.g. North America, Australia, Argentina,
Brazil) **[use a pragmatic, science-based approach]{.underline}** while
importers (e.g. the EU and others) have been more cautious, using
science tempered by political considerations (Smyth and Phillips 2014).

Genome editing

Mutagenetic technologies advanced rapidly in the 2000s into what is now
known as [genome editing,]{.underline} which [refers to point-specific
mutations in the genome]{.underline}, such as site-directed nucleases
(SDN) and oligo-directed mutagenesis (ODM). The SDN technology includes
a number of variants with analogous function: transcription
activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN), zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN)
and meganucleases, culminating in the discovery of CRISPR (Doudna and
Charpentier 2014). SDNs allow for the introduction of small precision
modifications (SDN 1 and 2) of larger pieces of DNA or introduction of
complete genes at a predetermined location (SDN3). [Genome editing has
numerous advantages over earlier technologies, most significantly that
it allows for targeted, single gene mutation across the entire plant
genome. The CRISPR suite of breeding tools offers an easier, more
versatile and accurate form of mutagenesis that facilitates transfer of
the desired trait to progeny without losing any efficacy]{.underline}
(Georges and Ray 2017). This technology is able to perform mutations to
a specific site within the targeted gene, making the effects on the
plants more significant (Song et al. 2016), as it can be programmed to
target specific segments of genetic code or edit DNA with greater
accuracy (Barrangou 2015). [In addition to crop breeders, this is
particularly attractive to animal and medical scientists as they
anticipate the potential for treating disease through genome
editing.]{.underline} Importantly, it holds great potential for public
sector plant breeding in developing countries, allowing for local and
regional solutions to improving food security. For example, a Chinese
research group (Miao et al. 2018) has already made use of CRISPR/Cas9
technology to create a rice variety that yields 25--31% more output than
conventional varieties. This could have profound implications for food
security.

Nonetheless, for all the benefits CRISPR/Cas9 seems capable of
providing, Smyth (2017a) identifies that not all governments will
embrace this technology. One reason is that applications of genome
editing yield different outcomes. Some modifications (SDN 1 and SDN 2)
can be generated by chemical mutagenesis, radiation or natural
mutations, with the resulting organisms similar to those obtained by
traditional breeding or classical mutagenesis (e.g. glyphosate-resistant
CRISPR rice for weed control). Other repair mechanisms involve
delivering foreign DNA (SDN 3), with the outcome that the resulting
products would be viewed as transgenic for regulatory risk assessments.
In 2016, in response to a lawsuit launched by nine non-governmental
organizations, a French court referred a request to regulate
genome-edited varieties as GMOs to the Court of Justice of the European
Union (CJEU) for an interpretation of European Law pertaining to new
plant breeding techniques, especially CRISPR/Cas9. On 25 July 2018, the
CJEU ruled that mutagenic crops are subject to the European Union's
regulatory system in the same way as transgenic GM organisms (CJEU
2018). The ruling refers to modern forms of mutagenesis, and it did not
clarify any genome-editing exemption. Regrettably, additional clarity
will not be forthcoming as in January 2019 the European Commission
announced that no new legislation regarding the regulation of crop
technologies is planned, resulting in the CJEU ruling being binding in
its current form (Livingstone 2019).

7.2 Environmental Impacts of Insecticide and Herbicide Use Changes

[Assessment of the impact of GM crops on insecticide and herbicide use
utilises two measures: the amount of herbicide or insecticide active
ingredient]{.underline} used and Cornell University's Environmental
Impact Quotient (EIQ) indicator (Kovach et al. 1992). This integrates
various environmental impacts of individual pesticides into a single
'field value per hectare' and therefore [can be readily used to make
comparisons between different production systems across many regions and
countries and provides an improved assessment of the impact of GM crops
on the environment when compared to only examining changes in volume of
active ingredient applied]{.underline}. This is because it draws on some
of the key toxicity and environmental exposure data related to
individual products, as applicable to impacts on farm workers, consumers
and ecology.

7.2.1 [GM HT Crops]{.underline}

A key impact of GM HT (largely tolerant to glyphosate) technology use
has been a change in the profile of herbicides typically used. In
general, a fairly broad range of, mostly selective (grass weed and
broad-leaved weed) herbicides has been replaced by one or two
broad-spectrum herbicides (mostly glyphosate) used in conjunction with a
small number of other (complementary) herbicides (e.g., 2,4-D). This has
[resulted in:]{.underline}

[Aggregate reductions in both the volume of herbicides used]{.underline}
(in terms of weight of active ingredient applied) [and the associated
field EIQ values when compared to usage on conventional]{.underline}
(non-GM) crops in some countries (e.g., herbicide use on soybeans in
Canada), **[indicating net improvements to the
environment]{.underline}**;

In other countries (e.g., herbicide use in soybeans in Brazil), the
average amount of herbicide active ingredient applied to GM HT crops
represents a net increase relative to usage on the conventional crop
alternative. However, even though the amount of active ingredient use
has increased, in terms of the associated environmental impact, as
measured by the EIQ indicator**[, the environmental profile of the GM HT
crop has commonly been better than its conventional
equivalent]{.underline}**;

Where GM HT crops (tolerant to glyphosate) have been widely grown,
incidences of weed resistance to glyphosate have occurred and have
become a major problem in some regions (see www.weedscience.org). This
can be attributed to how glyphosate was originally used with GM HT
crops, where because of its highly effective, broad-spectrum
post-emergence activity, it was often used as the sole method of weed
control. This approach to weed control put tremendous selection pressure
on weeds and as a result contributed to the evolution of weed
populations dominated by resistant individuals. As a result, over the
last 15 years, growers of GM HT crops have been (and are increasingly
being) advised to use other herbicides (with different and complementary
modes of action) in combination with glyphosate and in some cases
adopting cultural practices (e.g., revert to ploughing) in more
integrated weed management systems (Vencil et al. 2012; Norsworthy et
al. 2012). Also, in the last 2--3 years, GM HT crops tolerant to
additional herbicides (typically providing multiple tolerances in a
crop) such as 2,4-D, dicamba and glufosinate have become available. At
the macro level, these changes have influenced the mix, total amount,
cost and overall profile of herbicides applied to GM HT crops. This
means that compared to the early 2000s, the amount and number of
herbicide active ingredient used with GM HT crops in most regions has
increased, and the associated environmental profile, as measured by the
EIQ indicator, deteriorated. Nevertheless, [the amount of herbicide used
on conventional crops has also increased over the same time period and
that compared to the conventional alternative, the environmental profile
of GM HT crop use has continued to represent an improvement compared to
the conventional alternative]{.underline} (as measured by the EIQ
indicator, see for example, Brookes and Barfoot 2018). It should also be
noted that [many of the herbicides used in conventional production
systems had significant resistance issues themselves in the mid
1990s]{.underline} and this was one of the reasons why glyphosate
tolerant soybean technology was rapidly adopted, as glyphosate provided
good control of these weeds.

7.2.1.1 GM HT Soybean

The environmental impact of herbicide use change associated with GM HT
soybean adoption between 1996 and 2018 is summarised in Table 7.1.
Overall, there has been a small net increase in the amount of herbicide
active ingredient used (+0.1%), which equates to 5 million kg more
active ingredient applied to these crops than would otherwise have
occurred if a conventional crop had been planted. However, the
environmental impact, as measured by the EIQ indicator, improved by
12.9% due to the increased usage of more environmentally benign
herbicides.

Table 7.1 GM HT soybean: summary of active ingredient usage and
associated EIQ changes 1996--2018

Full size table

At the country level, some user countries recorded both a net reduction
in the use of herbicide active ingredient and an improvement in the
associated environmental impact, as measured by the EIQ indicator.
Others, such as Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguayand Uruguayhave seen net
increases in the amount of herbicide active ingredient applied, though
the overall environmental impact, as measured by the EIQ indicator has
improved. The largest environmental gains have tended to be in developed
countries where the usage of herbicides has traditionally been highest
and where there has been a significant movement away from the use of
several selective herbicides to one broad spectrum herbicide initially,
and in the last few years, plus complementary herbicides, with different
modes of action, targeted at weeds that are difficult to control with
glyphosate.

In 2018[, the amount of herbicide active ingredient applied to the
global GM HT soybean crop increased by]{.underline} 6.8 million kg
[(+2.4%)]{.underline} relative to the amount reasonably expected if this
crop area had been planted to conventional cultivars. This highlights
the point above relating to recent increases in herbicide use with GM HT
crops to take account of weed resistance issues. However, [despite these
increases in the volume of active ingredient used, in EIQ terms, the
environmental impact of the 2018 GMHT soybean crop continued to
represent an improvement relative to the conventional
alternative]{.underline} [(a 10.6% improvement]{.underline}).

7.2.1.2 GM HT Maize

The [adoption of GM HT maize has resulted in a significant reduction in
the volume of herbicide active ingredient usage (−242 million kg of
active ingredient) and an improvement in the associated environmental
impact]{.underline}, as measured by the EIQ indicator, between 1996 and
2018 (Table 7.2).

Table 7.2 GM HT maize: summary of active ingredient usage and associated
EIQ changes 1996--2018

Full size table

In 2018, [the reduction in herbicide usage relative to the amount
reasonably expected if this crop area had been planted to conventional
cultivars was 1.8 million kg of active ingredient (−0.9%), with a larger
environmental improvement, as measured by the EIQ indicator of
8.4%.]{.underline} As with GM HT soybeans, the greatest environmental
gains have been in developed countries (e.g., the US and Canada), where
the usage of herbicides has traditionally been highest.

7.2.1.3 GM HT Cotton

The use of [GM HT cotton delivered a net reduction in herbicide active
ingredient use of 39.5 million kg over the 1996--2018
period]{.underline} (Table 7.3). This represents an 9.6% reduction in
usage, and, in terms of the EIQ indicator, a 12.2% net environmental
improvement. In 2018, the use of GM HT cotton technology cotton resulted
in a 3.8 million kg reduction in herbicide active ingredient use
(−14.5%) relative to the amount reasonably expected if this crop area
had been planted to conventional cotton. [In terms of the EIQ indicator,
this represents a 17.7% environmental improvement.]{.underline}

#### Insect resistant GM crops have reduced insecticide use by upwards of 85%. That's good.

7.2.2 GM IR Crops

**[The main way in which these technologies have impacted on the
environment has been through reduced insecticide use between 1996 and
2018]{.underline}** (Tables 7.5 and 7.6) **[with the GM IR technology
effectively replacing insecticides used to control important crop
pests.]{.underline}** [This is particularly evident in respect of
cotton,]{.underline} which [traditionally has been a crop on which
intensive treatment regimes of insecticides were
commonplace]{.underline} to control bollworm/budworm pests. In maize,
the insecticide use savings have been more limited because the pests
that the various technology targets tend to be less widespread in maize
than budworm/bollworm pests are in cotton. In addition, [insecticides
were widely considered to have limited effectiveness against some pests
in maize crops]{.underline} (e.g., stalk borers) because the pests occur
where sprays are not effective (e.g., inside stalks). As a result of
these factors, [the proportion of the maize crop in most GM IR user
countries that typically received insecticide treatments before the
availability of GM IR technology was much lower than the share of the
cotton crops receiving insecticide treatments (]{.underline}e.g., in the
US, no more than 10% of the maize crop typically received insecticide
treatments targeted at stalk boring pests and about 30--40% of the crop
annually received treatments for rootworm).

EIQ changes 1996--2018

Full size table

Table 7.6 GM IR cotton: summary of active ingredient usage and
associated EIQ changes 1996--2018

Full size table

[The global insecticide savings from using GM IR maize and cotton in
2018 were 8.3 million kg **(−82% of insecticides** typically targeted at
maize stalk boring and rootworm pests)]{.underline} and 20.9 million kg
(−55% of all insecticides used on cotton) respectively of active
ingredient use relative to the amounts reasonably expected if these crop
areas had been planted to conventional maize and cotton. In EIQ indictor
terms, **[the respective environmental improvements in 2018 were 88%
associated with insecticide use targeted at maize stalk boring and
rootworm pests and 59% associated with cotton
insecticides.]{.underline}** Cumulatively since 1996, [the gains have
been a 112.4 million kg reduction in maize insecticide active ingredient
use and a 331 million kg reduction in cotton insecticide active
ingredient use]{.underline} (Tables 7.5 and 7.6).

In 2018, IR soybeans were in their sixth year of commercial use in South
America (mostly Brazil). During this period (2013--2018), the
insecticide use (active ingredient) saving relative to the amount
reasonably expected if this crop area had been planted to conventional
soybeans was 14.9 million kg (8.2% of total soybean insecticide use),
with an associated environmental benefit, as measured by the EIQ
indicator saving of 8.6% (Table 7.7).

associated EIQ changes 2013--2018

7.2.3 Aggregated (Global Level) Impacts

**[At the global level, GM technology has contributed to a significant
reduction in the negative environmental impact associated with
insecticide and herbicide use on the areas devoted to GM
crops]{.underline}**. Since 1996, [the use of pesticides on the GM crop
area has fallen by **775.4 million kg** of active
ingredient]{.underline} (an 8.3% reduction) relative to the amount
reasonably expected if this crop area had been planted to conventional
crops. [The environmental impact associated with herbicide and
insecticide use on these crops, as measured by the EIQ indicator,
improved by **18.5%.**]{.underline} In 2018, the environmental benefit
was equal to a reduction of 51.7 million kg of pesticide active
ingredient use (−8.6%), with the environmental impact associated with
insecticide and herbicide use on these crops, as measured by the EIQ
indicator, improving by 19%.

At the country level, [US farms have seen the largest environmental
benefits]{.underline}, with a 404 million kg reduction in pesticide
active ingredient use (52% of the total). [This is not surprising given
that US farmers were first to make widespread use of GM crop technology,
and for several years, the GM adoption levels in all four US crops have
been in excess of 80%,]{.underline} and insecticide/herbicide use has,
in the past been, the primary method of weed and pest control. Important
environmental benefits have also occurred in Chinaand Indiafrom the
adoption of GM IR cotton, with a reduction in insecticide active
ingredient use of over 276 million kg (1996--2018).

### GMOs---2NC---Carbon Sequestration

#### GM crops reduce greenhouse gas emissions by lowering treatment and tillage. That sequesters carbon!

Biotechnology, 87-101. August 31, 2021.\]

7.3 **[Greenhouse Gas Emission Savings]{.underline}**

Assessment of the impact of GM crop use on greenhouse gas emissions
combines reviews on evidence of how [GM crop usage has impacted on fuel
use and tillage systems.]{.underline} **[GM crops contribute to a
reduction in fuel use from less frequent herbicide or insecticide
applications and a reduction in the energy use in soil
cultivation]{.underline}**. The application of [GM HT crops has also
facilitated a shift from a plough-based production system to a reduced
tillage (RT) or no tillage (NT) production system]{.underline} (CTIC
2002). No-till farming means that the ground is not ploughed at all,
while reduced tillage means that the ground is disturbed less than it
would be with traditional tillage systems. This shift away from a
plough-based, to [a RT/NT production system has resulted in a reduction
in fuel use]{.underline}. Secondly, [the use of RT/NT farming systems
increases the amount of organic carbon in the form of crop residue that
is **stored or sequestered in the soil** and therefore reduces **carbon
dioxide emissions to the environment**]{.underline} (Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change 2006).

7.3.1 Reduced Fuel Use

[The fuel savings associated with making fewer spray runs]{.underline}
in GM IR crops of maize and cotton (relative to conventional crops) [and
the switch from conventional tillage]{.underline} (CT) [to RT or NT
farming systems]{.underline} facilitated by GM HT crops, [have resulted
in **permanent savings in carbon dioxide emissions.** In 2018, this
amounted to a saving of 2456 million kg of carbon dioxide, arising from
reduced fuel use of 920 million litres]{.underline} (Table 7.8). These
[savings are equivalent to taking **1.63 million cars off the road** for
one year.]{.underline}

Table 7.8 Carbon storage/sequestration from reduced fuel use with GM
crops 2018

Full size table

[The largest fuel use-related reductions in carbon dioxide emissions
have come from]{.underline} the adoption of GM HT technology in soybeans
and how it has facilitated [a switch to RT/NT production systems with
their reduced soil cultivation practices]{.underline} (78% of total
savings 1996--2018). These savings have been greatest in South America.

Over the period 1996--2018**[, the cumulative permanent reduction in
fuel use has been about 34,172 million kg of carbon dioxide, arising
from reduced fuel use of 12,799 million litres. In terms of car
equivalents, this is equal to taking 22.65 million cars off the road for
a year.]{.underline}**

7.3.2 Additional Soil Carbon Storage/Sequestration

As indicated earlier, the widespread adoption and maintenance of RT/NT
production systems in North and South America, facilitated by GM HT
crops (especially in soybeans) has improved growers' ability to control
competing weeds, reducing the need to rely on soil cultivation and
seed-bed preparation as means to getting good levels of weed control. As
a result[, as well as tractor fuel use for tillage being reduced, soil
quality has been enhanced and levels of soil erosion cut]{.underline}.
In turn, **[more carbon remains in the soil and this leads to lower GHG
emissions.]{.underline}**

Based on savings arising from the rapid adoption of RT/NT farming
systems in North and South America, [we estimate that an extra 5606
million kg of soil carbon has been sequestered in 2018 (equivalent to
20,581 million kg of carbon dioxide that has not been released into the
global atmosphere]{.underline}). These [savings are equivalent to taking
**13.6 million** cars off the road for one year]{.underline} (Table
7.9).

Table 7.9 Context of carbon sequestration impact 2018: car equivalents

Full size table

The additional amount of soil carbon sequestered since 1996 has been
equivalent to 302,364 million kg of carbon dioxide that has not been
released into the global atmosphere. Cumulatively, the amount of carbon
sequestered may be higher than this estimate due to year-on-year
benefits to soil quality (e.g., less soil erosion, greater water
retention and reduced levels of nutrient run off). However, it is
equally possible that the total cumulative soil sequestration gains have
been lower because only a proportion of the crop area will have remained
in NT/RT. It is, nevertheless, not possible to confidently estimate
cumulative soil sequestration gains that take into account reversions to
conventional tillage because of a lack of data. Consequently, the
estimate provided of 302,364 million kg of carbon dioxide not released
into the atmosphere should be treated with caution.

Aggregating the carbon sequestration benefits from reduced fuel use and
additional soil carbon storage, [the total carbon dioxide savings in
2018 are equal to about 23,027 million kg, equivalent to taking 15.27
million cars off the road for a year. This is equal to 48% of registered
cars in the UK.]{.underline}

### GMOs---2NC---Food

#### CRISPR produced the second wave of GM crops. That resolves food insecurity by improving yields and managing negative traits. GE resolves the short comings of first gen GMOs.

2021. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06477-9\]

Why [CRISPR/Cas9 edited crops are not considered GM crops]{.underline}?

Both mutagenesis and the CRISPR/Cas9 systems are considered equivalent
as these approaches induce mutation. **[Using the CRISPR/Cas9 approach,
no foreign DNA is left in the mutated plant that makes it exempted from
the definition of GMO and its regulation.]{.underline}** Also, the gRNA
that is used in the CRISPR/Cas9 system is not rDNA (Recombinant DNA).
The organism created by the oligonucleotide-directed mechanism is
considered a GMO because introducing oligonucleotide is not a natural
process. [Thus, there is always confusion between genetically modified
crops and genetically engineered crops which is also a consequence, of
people not accepting GE crops.]{.underline} In GM organisms or
traditional transgenesis, there is no control on site of gene
introduction and about its amplification (copies,) [while in GE
organisms (using nucleases including CRISPR/Cas9) any gene can be
introduced or deleted at a specific location that helps in the
modification of DNA.]{.underline} Thus, **[this technique shows more
advantages over first-generation GM due to its precision, controllable
nature, and low target effects]{.underline}**. Apart from this, all the
editing process was done using single-locus so that it can be readily
accessible and available to researchers for use in their area of
research.

Crop improvement using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology

**[With the increasing population, food demand is also increasing. Crop
improvement is an important endeavor for meeting this requirement. The
CRISPR/Cas9 system acted as a revolutionary technology in crop
improvement which mainly focuses on improving yields, stress management,
and quality by knocking out genes showing undesirable
traits.]{.underline}** This [technique is used to achieve powdery mildew
resistance in Wheat]{.underline} (Triticum aestivum) and tomato by
knocking out the MLO gene \[24\]. In Glycine max, the Fatty Acid
Desaturase gene converts Oleic acid into Linolenic acid. The
[CRISPR-cas9 system can be applied to]{.underline} induce mutation in
FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B that restricts the conversion into linolenic acid
and thus [enhancing its nutrition index and shelf life]{.underline}
\[25\].

Constructs of sgRNA and Cas9 were used to deliver ripening inhibitor
protein (RIN) to regulate fruit ripening in tomato \[26\]. Cas9
construct with HDR template is used to target an Aceto-lactate synthase
(ALS) gene in rice to obtain bi-allelic mutation \[27\]. [The
CRISPR/Cas9 system is also a valuable tool for activation and repression
for transcription of the targeted gene in any plant genome.]{.underline}
Catalytically inactive dCas9, fused with gRNA, can activate
transcription of anthocyanin pigment by targeting AtPAP1 \[28\]. The
dCas9-VP64 has reversed the silencing effect of methylation of AtFIS2 in
fertilization-independent seed in Arabidopsis. The use of these
nucleases has allowed scientists to develop the desired plant varieties
more efficiently and rapidly than conventional breeding. [**This
technology also enhances the domestication of orphan crops including
finger millet, groundnut, tef, yam, and cassava**. In almonds, the
CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been used to produce plants with sweet seeds
but carries bitterness in other plants due to amygdalin. **This
domestication plays an important role in increasing global food security
with the CRISPR/Cas9 technology.**]{.underline} But with the advancement
of these gene-editing technologies, it remains to know how the public
perceives these crops and how regulatory realms will deal with them.

### GMOs---2NC---AT: GMOs Bad

#### Criticisms of GM crops result from a lack of knowledge and trust \-- *not* scientific backing. And, CRISPR resolves consumer fears of first gen gmos.

Views of public towards GM and GE crops

[The major problem faced by GM and GE crops is public
acceptance.]{.underline} These engineered crops have been grown
commercially since the 1990s and have expanded to various nations
including the USA, Brazil, and India. But at the same time, some people
are inadmissible about food products of GMs. [The major reason for this
may be the potential environmental and health risks due to unwilling
genetic changes, lack of trust in multinational agrochemical companies,
lack of knowledge about GE crops, ethical issues, adequacy of regulatory
systems, and off-target mutations]{.underline}. Lack of trust in
companies was clearly expressed both in a survey and in focus groups in
a recent Norwegian study \[52\]. Similar attitudes have also been
documented in Swedish reports \[53\]. Many surveys have also found that
in European countries, consumers are more concerned about food security
\[37\]. The consumers in European countries, also emphasized issues
including origin and quality of food products (European \[54\]. In
addition, the concern with naturalness in food production, exemplified
by cisgenic modification is more acceptable than transgenic in public
surveys \[55, 56[\]. To overcome these challenges, people should be
informed about the difference between GM and GE crops]{.underline}
(Table 3) with the pros and cons of breeding techniques. [GE crops are
free of the transgene, thus no flow of transgene and do not affect
biological diversity in overall]{.underline}. Major arguments in favor
and against GE crops are also tabulated in Table 4. [GE crops are very
similar to wild species and so tagged with a DNA tag and should be
assessed in the isolated field for their impact on the
environment.]{.underline} Secondly, a global regulatory model is
expected to fill this gap so that people do not wonder which regulation
is superior over the other. The regulatory status must be amended so
that people can trust and approve it without any hesitation. The
regulations like SECURE in the USA help many plant breeders and
companies to achieve small niches in GE crops creation. The government
of different countries should surrogate between developers and the
public to carefully consider the degree of health risk of each crop
variety for which off-targets are also considered. Consumers should also
consider the "right to know" if there is difficulty in acceptance of
these new generation crops. Such endorsements will definitively help
consumers to gradually accept genome-edited crops in near future.

generation) and genetically modified (second generation) crops

Conclusions and future outlook

[Novel genome editing techniques have shifted our focus from the
insertion of protein-coding DNA towards DNA modifying enzymes and
regulatory RNAs]{.underline} \[30\]. **[CRISPR/Cas9 has emerged as one
of the revolutionary editing tools]{.underline}** due to its
unprecedented ability of precise editing, diverse applications, and
minimum off-targets. Advances in gene-editing technologies have made it
popular due to its diverse functions in crop improvement such as
replacement, knock-out, knock-in, and point mutations, at any gene locus
of crops. But at the same time, some questions are raised about its
regulatory framework, especially concerning its integration into the GMO
regulatory framework. **[The best GMO regulatory framework for plant
breeding purposes is the regulatory framework of the USA The USA
regulation has been documented with full optimization from scientific
and social standpoints]{.underline}**. The regulatory framework of
Argentina is also very convincing with the concept of new plant breeding
technology. The economy of India country that is based upon agricultural
practices needs to redraft its regulation for breeders to develop new GE
varieties to feed the 13.9 billion population of the world as soon as
possible. [The most important consideration for GMO is the assessment of
health risks and food safety for all countries]{.underline}. Failing to
adopt the GE technique has a major impact on research and foundations.
Science and technology are heavily influenced by public opinion in many
countries. In terms of genetic crop improvement, a decision in accepting
the NPBTs is the major factor taken into consideration. [Considering the
NPBTs products especially created by the CRISPR/Cas9 technology under
GMO will make the approval process more complicated. This practice will
limit the commercial development of these techniques.]{.underline}
However, exempting the GE varieties and utilization of already approved
genes definitively encourage interesting opportunities for breeders as
well as startup companies, to achieve certain niches in the creation of
GE crops. At this stage, active engagement between developers and the
public is highly needed so that researcher or developers and both
eloquent their research to society and communicate that helps in
eradicating the misconceptions regarding the genome editing technology
in plants. Communication on research should also take place from
beginning to end, with different stages of development \[57\] especially
on the diverse application of these techniques and their effects and
impacts on the public and environmental health. These attainments will
definitively gradually help the consumer to accept genome-edited crops.

Introduction

Products from natural sources are being used from centuries \[1,2,3\].
Processing the natural products to get significant benefits have been
the priority in every era of science \[4,5,6,7[\]. Biotechnology is an
advanced, yet developed, technology that develops or modifies a product
for some applied purpose utilizing living organisms and/or substances
from these.]{.underline} It can be extended to all organism genera,
i.e., from less complicated genera like viruses and bacteria to more
complicated genera like plants and animals. So, biotechnology has become
a major feature of modern industry, agriculture and medicine. [Modern
biotechnology provides a number of methods that scientists use to
recognize and control the genetic structure of species for use in
agricultural product development or processing]{.underline} \[8\].

[The implications of biotechnology includes, breeding of plants for
raising and stabilizing yields by improving their ability to confront
various pests, insects and other possible threats, to fight various
conditions like drought and counter diseases that could attack and cold
and soil acidity, biotechnology is also being applied for nutritional
enhancement of various foods]{.underline} \[9, 10\].

Disease-Free Plants

**[Disease-free plants are a very practical applications of
biotechnology]{.underline}**, these could be produced by
micropropagation method. [One of the examples of such plants is banana.
Bananas are typically grown in countries where they emerge to be major
source of income/employment and/or food. Micropropagation is a way to
regenerate disease-free plantlets of bananas from tissues of healthy
banana plants]{.underline}. It has all the possible benefits of being a
revolutionary technique that is relatively inexpensive and easy to use
\[11\].

[Agriculture on acid soils]{.underline}

[Lime can be applied to the soil to preserve the pH of the
soil]{.underline}. This process emerges to be excellent but is expensive
and temporary as well. Alternatively, it is possible to grow improved
cultivars which are tolerant of aluminum \[9\].

**[Fortification of Crops]{.underline}**

**[In developing countries or countries where there is a lot of shortage
of food, fortified crops emerge to be an excellent food source which are
supplemented with nutrients for rising malnourished
children]{.underline}**. [One of the examples of such fortified crops is
\'Protato\'. This, genetically modified potato, is being widely
cultivated and used in India and provides approximately one-third to
one-half more protein than a common potato]{.underline}. In addition,
this genetically modified potato also contains significant quantities of
all essential amino acids, such as lysine and methionine. [This
\'Protato\' could be a very potential food source in countries where
potato is a major staple food]{.underline} \[12\]. [Another example of
such crops is golden rice. These genetically modified rice has a higher
content of beta-carotene]{.underline} \[13\]. The grains and leaves of
cowpeas are considered to be used as side or relish dishes. The cowpea
is being consumed as staple food in various countries. The varieties of
cowpeas with genetically modification has been grown in Tanzania \[14\].
[The fortification of nutrients to enhance the nutritional status of
crops, developed by genetically modified organisms]{.underline} with the
major difference has been reported in Table1.

crops breeding

Animal Feed

Genetically modified crops are practically being used in developed
countries. Such kind of crops have a very significant potential to
provide more nutrients than the normal \[22\].

[Reproduction in Aquaculture]{.underline}

[Biotechnology has emerged to have great practical applications in
aquaculture]{.underline}, biotechnology has [helped to maximize the
growth and production]{.underline} in the aquaculture. Research is being
continued in this field for better and harmless production of aquatic
organisms suitable for human consumption \[23\].

**[Pest Resistant Crops]{.underline}**

[Pest attack is one of the very common problem in a number of different
crops all around the globe, these crops may include fodder crops or
other crops for the purpose of getting food.]{.underline} [One the
example of such crops is BT-Cotton]{.underline}. The genes of Bacillus
thuringiensis (Bt), a very common, are inserted in cotton crop in order
for development of certain protein in it. The protein is very toxic to a
number of different insects. [With this aid of biotechnology, the
developed BT-Cotton leads to a less pest attack ultimately leading to a
significant more production]{.underline} \[24\].

[Drought Resistant Crops]{.underline}

Targeted and short gun methods are two different two different but main
techniques in genetic engineering. These [techniques are applied in
order to obtain transgenic plants that will possess the ability to
confer drought resistance]{.underline} \[10\].

**[Biofuel]{.underline}**

[The prosperity of future is mainly based on the supply of equitable,
secure, sustainable and affordable energy. Production of biofuel is one
of the emerged trends in recent years. Biofuel could be an emerged and
reliable substitute of fossil fuels]{.underline}. Six microalgae's
strains were photosynthetically produced in a photobioreactor. Among
these six microalgae, the Chlorella vulgaris strain is most dominant for
the production of biodiesel. The Chlorella vulgaris has been used as
feedstock. The quality of biofuel and productivity of lipids could be
measured as a criterion for the selection of species to produce
biodiesel \[25\].

[Vaccine Development]{.underline}

[Biotechnology has developed potential platform for scientists to
develop wide ranges of vaccine in cheap and reliable ways and in mass
production for all scales]{.underline} \[26\].

Fermentation

Fermentation is a predominant process to synthesize breweries. At
commercial level, several strains of yeast are being utilized for the
production of breweries. The light wine can be made through the
mechanism of genetic engineering. Foreign gene encoded with glucoamylase
has enabled to modify yeast. The glucoamylase is expressed through yeast
during the fermentation process by which conversion of starch into
glucose has been reported \[27\]. The strains of yeast are used for
synthesis of wine which are capable of initiating malolactic
fermentation. Synthesis of wine is comprised of two steps: 1) Primary
fermentation uses yeast to convert the glucose into alcohol. 2)
Secondary fermentation results in the production of lactic acid with the
maximum acidity level using bacteria. The costly divergent strategies
are applied to overcome this issue. The malolactic gene such as
Lactobacillus delbrueckii is inserted into the strain of industrial
yeast to resolve this problem. This gene depresses the conversion of
malate hence minimizing the wine acidity level \[27\].

[Enzymes]{.underline}

[Enzymes are specifically used in processing and production of different
items of food at industrial level]{.underline}. In 20th century second
last decade, companies are being using enzymes to process food. The
production of food is done by developing the technique of producing
organisms through genetically modification. These enzymes contain
carbohydrases and proteases. [The maximum production could be achieved
by the cloning of genes for these in minimum time period. These enzymes
are specifically used for producing curd, cheese and flavoring items of
food. Maximum percentage of enzymes are used in the industry of
food.]{.underline} The more than 50% quantities of carbohydrases and
proteases are being utilized in the USA industry of food. These enzymes
comprise of α-amylase and rennin \[27\].

**[Use of Biotechnology to Improve Yield]{.underline}**

Milk is being consumed all over the world as a beneficial food with high
nutritional value. [The pituitary gland releases bovine Somatotropin
hormone which increases the production of milk. Formerly, the calves
were being slaughtered to extract this hormone from their brain.
Nevertheless, that method results in the less hormone quantity.
Scientists utilized Escherichia coli for the insertion of gene with
encoded bovine Somatotropin in it. Now, this hormone results in the
production of more quantity]{.underline}. This hormone obtains 10--12%
increase in the production of milk. In 2050, the world's population will
be reported nine billion. Consequently, on the same land, higher yield
will be required. Potentially, [biotechnology is the best technology to
combat various food yield problem]{.underline} \[27\]. The greater level
of hunger and poverty is reported in Africa. The malnutrition and hunger
causes consequences in the case of in diseases such as rickets and
kwashiorkor. These diseases result higher deaths. Africa can get rid of
starvation, diseases, malnutrition and hunger with maximumly potential
usage of biotechnology. It can improve standard of health and decrease
rate of mortality. [Three countries of Africa: Egypt, South Africa and
Burkina Faso have been already profited through biotechnological
adaptation of numerous methods of cultivation. For instance, 0.1 million
Burkina Faso's farmers elevated the cotton yield by 126% with the
potential use of GM technology of food.]{.underline} The technology of
GM food is adopted which is required for the commercial system. It
causes the products of GMO release, allergenicity tests, toxicity and
digestivity of GM food. In that particular area, European Union and USA
should assist Africa. Many countries of Africa deficient in the system
of biosafety. African should develop biosafety laws and make sure their
approval their as priority for the easily adoption of system. The
deficiency of education is another obstacle in the technology of GM
food's adoption. Kenyan people are much concerned about technology of GM
food as they made protest against it. The lack of education is the major
factor of the adverse attitude of people of Kenya toward biotechnology
of food. People should be aware of advantages and disadvantages of GM
technology of food through conveyance of message in seminars by
scientists \[28\].

[Shell Life]{.underline}

[Various juice of fruits possesses minimum shell life]{.underline}. For
instance, tomato is being consumed all over the world. Tomatoes should
be harvested at stage of mature green in order to transportation. [They
are exposed to ethylene for earlier ripening and then picking. The quick
ripening of tomatoes is due to more temperatures although, their taste
could be destroyed at low temperature. A company of
California]{.underline} named Calgene engineered genetically tomato to
resolve that problem. [They produced Flavr Savr variety of tomatoes in
order to sort out the issue. An enzyme which is named as
polygalacturonase causes the breakdown of pectin to ensure
ripening]{.underline}. Scientists modified genetically tomatoes to
decrease the quantity of enzyme. Antisense RNA is used for that specific
purpose \[28\]. Low quantity of that enzyme shows consequences in the
case of breakdown of cell wall and pectin in stronger tomatoes. These
Flavr Savr variety possess tomatoes of firmer quality with increased
shell life and later support transport \[29\].

### Pseudoscience---1NC

#### Genetic engineering is not perfect, *but* sweeping criticism lapse into pseudoscience that precludes reform and jeopardizes lifesaving innovation

Dinner, an Easy Target for Charlatans

**[The topic of food cooks up frequent morsels of
pseudoscience]{.underline}**---from fad diets to unfounded fears to
age-old traditions that social archaeologists trace back to their
ancient foundations in 1972. In recent times it is hard to find a more
flaming insult to the sci- entific method than the loose claims centered
on the topic of food. [Within that space the tools of genetic
engineering]{.underline} (GE; the scientifically precise term for what
is famil- iarly referred to as "GMO") [are among the most maligned of
food technologies. The ability to cut and paste DNA sequences from one
organism to another has been with us for almost half a century and is
universally considered a revolutionary technology]{.underline}--- and
you ain't seen nothin' yet. We have been using such technologies to make
drugs like insulin, enzymes for cheesemaking, and all kinds of compounds
ranging from vitamins to nutritional supplements to chemotherapeutic
agents. [Even the most ardent activ- ists do not express too much
concern about such applications, as they expand healthy options that
enrich our lives. In many cases they make life itself possible; not only
that, **they give us cheese.**]{.underline} The world does not have
enough slaughterhouse floor pancreases to meet the modern demand for
insulin. [Genetic engineering makes the availability of therapeutic
drugs like insulin safer and more reliable]{.underline}. The decreased
medical demand for pancreases probably keeps hotdog prices down too.
-[But apply GE technology to crops that produce food ingredients, and
the conversation drastically shifts.]{.underline}

[Most commercial applications of GE have been in the area of agronomic
crops]{.underline}, where

over eighteen million acres of GE plants are grown worldwide
(Fernandez-Cornejo, Wechsler, and Milkove, 2016). As of today the major
crops that end up in the human diet are field corn (not sweet corn, the
other stuff fed to cows and car engines), canola (for canola oil), sugar
beets (for sugar), and soybeans (National Academies of Sciences, 2016).
The products derived from these GE crop plants end up in about 80
percent of grocery store products in North America. Essentially these
ingredients represent the dusting of corn starch, sugar, or oil used in
mass-produced foods. If you really think about it, [although the plants
are engineered to do something atypical]{.underline} (like resist
insects or herbicides), [the engineering process does not directly
influence the end products that go into our mouths]{.underline}. [While
the plants are engineered, the products we purify from them are exactly
identical to those from non-GE counterparts, except possibly for a
nanogram speck of stowaway DNA or maybe the protein it
encodes.]{.underline} The sugars, oils, and starches are chemically
identical to those that were derived from non-GE plants. That is the
majority of ingredients from GE plants in human food. Plenty of GE
cotton is grown for fiber, and a rapidly expanding acreage of GE alfalfa
is grown for cattle feed. In the United States there are a few GE plants
that produce food for humans, such as sugar from sugar beets, and those
products are identical to those from conventional or organic
counterparts (except they cost less). There also is a tiny acreage of
virus- resistant papaya in Hawaii and a few acres of virus-resistant
squash around that nobody cares about, because people do not really like
squash much. New products like safer, nonbrowning potatoes and
nonbrowning apples have been approved and their parent companies are
simply ramping up plant numbers before the products are widely avail-
able. Just in these first paragraphs a few myths have been busted.

Among scientists, there is remarkable consensus that these products are
safe (Fahlgren

et al., 2016; Nicolia, Manzo, Veronesi, and Rosellini, 2014), and they
allow farmers to pro- duce more food with fewer inputs (like
insecticides), which translates into larger profits on the farm (Klümper
and Qaim, 2014). Since their first implementation in 1996, there has not
been a single case of illness or death related to these products in
humans or other animals (Panchin and Tuzhikov, 2016; Van Eenennaam and
Young, 2014), a bril- liant safety record that underscores the success
of careful design and stringent regula- tory hurdles (Strauss and Sax,
2016).

[Certainly science recognizes some limitations and even negative
environmental impacts of overdependence on some GE
strategies]{.underline} (Lombardo, Coppola, and Zelasco, 2016). The
emerging problems of herbicide-resistant weeds and insect resistance to
plant-produced insect controls are very real indeed. Those of us working
in science when the products were released did not need crystal balls to
make such bold predic- tions. Anytime in life that we rely on a single
strategy to solve a problem we end up cre- ating more problems, and
herbicide and insect resistance to GE solutions is certainly a problem.
[With costly regulation's hands around the neck of progress, the three
to four chemistries that should have been developed were not, leaving
farmers with no easy way to rotate herbicides in a manner that would
kill weeds yet leave crops unmolested]{.underline}. The emergence of
resistant weeds and insects is a residue of a well-financed pseu-
doscientific tsunami that has paralyzed new product development. When we
create a paranoid development environment rife with manufactured risk,
we oftentimes spawn new issues by deploying half-solutions. However,
even with these shortcomings, the benefits of GE crops far outweigh the
risks (Kathage and Qaim, 2012; Klümper and Qaim, 2014). [Many
environmental benefits have been made possible in light of the
limitations]{.underline} (Brookes and Barfoot, 2015), [and the promise
of these technologies holds great potential to solve some of the world's
most critical food security and environmen- tal impact issues of growing
food.]{.underline}

**[Despite the widespread adoption and paucity of harm, there is a
burgeoning public controversy afoot]{.underline}** (Blancke, Van
Breusegem, De Jaeger, Braeckman, and Van Montagu, 2015). [What would
possibly lead people to ignore good data, double down on kludge
evidence, rally around the words of Internet food celebs, and condemn
the words of credentialed scientists? **Manufactured
risk**]{.underline}. [It is fomented from a vocal and well- financed
movement sworn to ending the sustained use of truly sustainable
technology. Extremists want to end any form of tinkering with plant
genetics; they wish a return to the pastoral charm of isolating insulin
from pancreases pulled from gut piles and human growth hormone extruded
from buckets of cadaver pituitaries]{.underline}---the stuff grand- dad
waxed fondly about. Others hold anticorporate or antiquated farming
agendas, and want the use of GE expunged from the farmer's field even
though they enjoy its benefits with a Coke at Chipotle or a wedge of
cheddar made with enzymes from GE microbes. **[Condemning GE's use and
enjoying its utility are incompatible ideas but consistent themes in the
anti-GE movement.]{.underline}**

Objection to new technology is not unnatural. Humans have shown time and
time

again that the emergence of a novel and powerful breakthrough frequently
travels with the gremlin of ill-placed skepticism. Major paradigm
shifts, from the Earth traveling around the sun to human conception in a
petri dish, have always broken scientific harmony with a sour note of
dissent. **[In the modern day this pushback against prog- ress manifests
as pseudoscientific claims that oftentimes are difficult to decipher
from actual science.]{.underline}** Examination of the literature over
the last twenty years uncovers some startling trends. **[Politically
motivated "sortascience" and the emerging trend of preda- tory
publishing abuses]{.underline}** (see Beall, this volume) **[allow soft
claims to creep into scientifi- cally weak publication venues that
appear legitimate.]{.underline}** Consumers and casual readers are
challenged to separate actual science from something sloppy that looks
science- shiny. The Internet is no friend to that foggy clarity[. A
well-orchestrated and typically well-financed manipulation of Internet
space amplifies pessimistic messages of gloom, translating illegitimate
science into a format for wide distribution and credulous con-
sumption]{.underline}. This is why consumers are in the confusing place
they are today, and why so many are concerned about their food.

The purpose of this chapter is to highlight the flimsy science that
pollutes the sci-

entific discussion of genetic engineering, a technology that
unfortunately shared a birth and toddlership with the Internet. [These
were two good technologies, poised to change the world. But today one is
used to malign the other, and their relationship is only becoming more
contentious as they transition into adolescence]{.underline}. The
chapter will demonstrate the role of poorly designed science, lofty
misinterpretations, or even deliberate misrepresentation of legitimate
science to bolster an ideological or political food, or anticorporate
agenda. [Discussion of blatantly bogus claims and the effects of the
pseudoscience around agricultural biotechnology will be
presented.]{.underline} Ultimately the thesis of this work is that [GE
is a powerful technology that, like any technology, has the ability to
do many good things. It certainly could be used for malevolent acts if
one was so inclined. Like any technology it has things it does well and
things it could do better. **It is not magic, it is not doom, and it is
not a panacea.**]{.underline} However, we are over twenty years into its
widespread deployment. [Where science should be dominating the discus-
sion of future application, crank pseudoscience in the popular press
clouds the public discussion of risk and benefit and slows deployment of
potentially useful technologies, with profound effects on those in
desperate need]{.underline}. We miss an opportunity to soothe the needs
of farmers, the environment, and those frozen in poverty, as well as the
affluent industrialized world consumer. **[Time will show that the
pseudoscience used to conjure risk around this sound technology has left
a considerable body count and unfortunate environmental
footprint.]{.underline}**

### Pseudoscience---2NC

#### Critiques of biotechnologies are antiscientific. They rely on the same [dangerous]{.underline} logic as vaccine denialism!

Baylor College of Medicine, Professor in the Depts of Pediatrics and
Molecular Virolocy & Microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine. \[Peter
J. "Combating antiscience: Are we preparing for the 2020s?" PLoS Biol,
18(3). Mar 27, 2020.\]

[The last decade was remarkable for a **rise in antiscience
activities**, especially in the areas of climate change, air pollution,
and synthetic chemicals, to name a few]{.underline}. [**In the
biological and biomedical sciences, vaccines and vaccination programs
became targets, as did gene editing, genetically modified crops, and
other biotechnologies.** Antiscience activists linked illnesses such as
cancer or Lyme disease to conspiracies and cover-ups. In parallel,
several populist governments worked to enact restrictions or slash
budgets to imperil the future of research institutions]{.underline} in
Brazil, Hungary, Italy, and the United States \[1--3\]. Some have voiced
concerns that we might enter a new "post-truth" era \[4\], which could
mean an expansion of attacks on both science and scientists.

[One of the most prominent and visible antiscience movements is active
in North America and Europe and focused on discrediting
vaccines]{.underline}. As both a vaccine scientist and autism advocate
for my adult daughter Rachel, I have been targeted by antivaccine
activists for more than 2 decades. However, these harassments
accelerated around the time leading up to the 2016 presidential election
campaign and then reached new levels in 2019 as public health
deteriorated due to declines in vaccinations \[5--7\]. Here, I give a
first-hand account of my experiences (as a type of case study) and use
them to propose potential reforms in graduate and postdoctoral science
training as a mechanism for countering antiscience.

[The year 2019 was a bad one in terms of the return of
vaccine-preventable diseases to the US and Europe. Measles cases in
Europe exceeded 100,000 and surpassed 1,000 in the US because of sharp
declines in immunizations with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR)
vaccine,]{.underline} while [thousands of teenagers were denied cancer
prevention through the human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccinations]{.underline}, and we saw many pediatric flu deaths among
unvaccinated children despite recommendations \[8--10\]. [The decline in
vaccinations is the result of several factors, but in the US and many
European nations, it is strongly linked to a strengthened, empowered,
and emboldened antivaccine movement]{.underline} \[9, 11--13\]. Whereas
in the past the antivaccine movement was mostly a fringe element, it
gained strength and critical mass to a point where it has affected
public health. It now dominates the internet with hundreds of
misinformation websites, amplified on social media and with political
links to populist movements \[14\]. Their major assertions are as
follows: (1) vaccines can cause autism or chronic illnesses; (2) these
conditions represent a form of "vaccine injury"; (3) vaccines are
unregulated and not adequately tested for safety; (4) vaccines contain
toxic ingredients; (5) parents must assert their "health freedom";
and/or (6) there is a conspiracy between the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention and vaccine manufacturers to "push" vaccines on an
unsuspecting public. In 2019, the World Health Organization listed
"vaccine hesitancy" as a leading global health threat \[15\].

Too often, the public health community has been slow or halting in its
response to the antivaccine movement. In the US, for example, the US
Congress held hearings on the antivaccine movement in February and March
of 2019, but they produced few, if any, tangible outcomes. In the
meantime, the media and political activities of the antivaccine movement
continue to expand and run mostly unopposed.

Go to:

**[Defending science]{.underline}**

As a pediatrician scientist who develops vaccines for poverty-related
neglected diseases, and as the parent of an adult daughter with autism,
I felt uniquely positioned to both defend vaccines and counter the fake
messaging coming from the antivaccine lobby. In 2018, I wrote a book,
entitled Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel's Autism: My Journey as a Vaccine
Scientist, Pediatrician, and Autism Dad (Johns Hopkins University
Press), to fill a void in the literature--[explaining the genetic
underpinnings of autism as well as the data refuting its links to
vaccines]{.underline}. I felt that adding a personal story to the public
dialogue on this issue might ultimately bridge a gap for both the
community of scientists and the families dealing with the realities of
the autism spectrum \[16\].

I hoped that by explaining the science of autism---how it begins in
early fetal brain development through the actions of dozens if not
hundreds of autism genes and epigenetic mechanisms---it would help make
the evidence showing that vaccines did not cause autism easier to grasp.
For example, through whole-exome sequencing on Rachel, my wife Ann, and
myself, we identified a potentially new autism gene possibly belonging
to a larger group of recently published autism genes encoding neuronal
cytoskeleton proteins \[17\].

I also felt it was important to put a face on science and scientists. A
study conducted by Research!America finds that almost no US citizens can
name a living scientist, and the few who did would name individuals such
as Bill Nye and Neil deGrasse Tyson. I'm a fan of both Nye and Tyson,
but for me, the survey essentially said that the typical working
scientist--who struggles daily with complicated lab meetings and
experiments, revising scientific papers, resubmitting grant
applications, and presenting at scientific meetings in front of critical
audiences---is mostly invisible. The US public has little knowledge
about what scientists actually do.

Although Vaccines was not my first book, it was certainly the most
personal, exposing my family and myself to public scrutiny. I felt this
was important to do in order to be effective at communicating to worried
and vaccine-hesitant parents. So far, the book has been relatively well
received by the scientific community and several academic societies, and
I have gotten many heartfelt emails and letters from parents thanking me
for my candor, scientific explanations, and willingness to speak out and
defend vaccines. Beyond the book, I have also since written several
op-eds and given both public lectures on the topic (including at annual
meetings of academic societies and at universities) and done interviews
and podcasts. It is difficult to measure the impact of my vaccine
advocacy, but based on correspondence and interactions with parents and
healthcare professionals across the country, I get the sense that for
many, my public remarks are often the first time they are hearing a
positive message about vaccines and their first interaction with an
actual scientist.

[There was, however, a downside of this public engagement: intense
exposure to an antivaccine media machine]{.underline}. It pelts my
Amazon.com site with one-star reviews or makes outrageous statements on
social media[. What has been more worrisome has been the stalking or
protests at meetings where I speak and some specific postings by leaders
of the antivaccine movement.]{.underline} In December of 2019, Robert F.
Kennedy Jr. posted to his Instagram account a statement claiming that I
am an "industry shill" for the multinational vaccine companies \[18\].
His evidence is that I receive grant funding from the Gates Foundation
and other sources, including a start-up biotech in the 1990s, perhaps
not understanding that principal investigators require grant funds to
support research scientists, experiments, and reagents. He also
digressed about Jonas Salk, saying that he is one of my scientific
heroes, which is true, but then went on to falsely accuse Dr. Salk of
nefarious activities. My worry is that one of Mr. Kennedy's many
followers might believe his posting and try to escalate their attacks.

Go to:

**[A larger response to antiscience]{.underline}**

**[The antivaccine movement is highly visible, but it is not the only
antiscience movement gaining in strength and access]{.underline}**. [I
loosely define an "antiscience movement" as an organized and funded
rejection of science and scientific principles and methods in factor of
alternative views, often linked to the targeting or harassment of
individual scientists]{.underline}. We are now seeing this play out in
other areas, including those highlighted earlier. **[I am especially
concerned that biomedicine's latest and cutting-edge biotechnologies
such as OMICs and CRISPR gene editing will come under attack and block
scientific progress that require these approaches.]{.underline}**
Without substantial efforts to counter them, [I believe that organized
antiscience movements will continue to gain ascendancy in the coming
decade of the 2020s.]{.underline}

There has been some progress. In 2018, the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences issued an important report on The Perceptions of Science in
America, which is part of a larger Public Face of Science Initiative
\[19\]. Its major findings include the somewhat reassuring message that
public confidence in science and scientific investments have remained
stable over the last 3 decades, although levels of confidence can vary
significantly depending on educational attainment, race, age, and
political ideologies; also, there is a need to understand why science
skepticism is particularly strong among certain groups \[19\]. Moreover,
the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the
National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) both
feature important discussions and workshops on the rise of antiscience,
particularly as it pertains to agencies of the US federal government,
while the former hosts the important Center for Public Engagement with
Science and Technology. Both the Union of Concerned Scientists and the
Committee of Concerned Scientists have worked to defend us from attacks.
Prominent science historians and philosophers have also addressed the
rise of organized antiscience \[20\], and there is an entire journal
devoted to the public understanding of science \[21\].

Ultimately, [combating antiscience movements and their organized
activities will require a complex response and, likely, the involvement
of major governments working in public--private
partnerships]{.underline}. [For the biomedical sciences, and possibly
other fields, I believe that a critical element must include expanded
visibility for scientists themselves, who are both "in the
mix"---meaning active in their fields, publishing papers, writing
grants, and speaking at scientific meetings---and simultaneously
comfortable with engaging the public and who are versatile in using
modern tools of written and oral communication.]{.underline}

Dinner, an Easy Target for Charlatans

**[The Danger of Soft Sortascience]{.underline}**

[Opponents of biotechnology will claim that the technology is simply a
vehicle for a handful of multinational corporations to obtain great
wealth and ultimately control the food supply]{.underline}. However,
**[these technologies have actually been shown to principally benefit
farmers]{.underline}** (Areal, Riesgo, and Rodriguez-Cerezo, 2013;

Abstract

The devastating COVID-19 pandemic has in an unprecedented way
accelerated the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines.
Repurposed and novel therapeutics have been evaluated for antiviral
therapy against SARS-CoV-2. Clinical benefits of remdesivir have led to
its approval for treatment of COVID-19. In contrast, drugs such as
hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin have not proven therapeutically
superior to placebo in clinical settings. Monoclonal antibodies have
demonstrated promise, especially for combination therapy cocktails.
Vaccine candidates based on inactivated virus, recombinant SARS-CoV-2
spike protein, viral vectors, and nucleic acids have been evaluated in
preclinical animal models eliciting strong immune responses and
providing protection against challenges with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore,
clinical trials have demonstrated neutralizing antibody titers superior
to those found in convalescent COVID-19 patients. RNA- and
adenovirus-based vaccines have been approved for use in humans resulting
in mass vaccinations around the world.

The current COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 271 million
infections, 5.3 million deaths globally, and has generated economic and
social destruction (Global Health Policy, 2021). It is therefore no
surprise that major financial and scientific investments have been
dedicated to treat and prevent COVID-19. At the time of the outbreak in
Wuhan, China no efficient antiviral drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2
were available. The alarming spread of infections, increase in death
rates, strict lockdowns and confinements and shutdown of the global
economy, brought on accelerated efforts to developed drugs and vaccines
against COVID-19. In the context of antiviral COVID-19 drugs, much
activity was dedicated to repurposing drugs showing efficacy against
other viruses, parasites, and even neurological disorders (Yousefi,
Mashouri, & Okpechi, 2021). Numerous efforts have also been dedicated to
computational biology, structural biology, and screening programs (Lam,
Lombardi, & Ouanounou, 2020). Vaccine development, due to its potential
for disease prevention, has received plenty of attention related to
COVID-19 based on inactivated viruses, protein subunits and peptides,
viral vectors, and nucleic acids (Lundstrom, 2020a). In this chapter,
drug and vaccine development against COVID-19 are presented.

12.1. Antiviral COVID-19 drugs

[In the context of drugs against COVID-19, two main approaches have been
pursued.]{.underline} Due to similarities between different viruses, it
has been appropriate to repurpose existing approved antiviral drugs. The
obvious advantages of this approach relate to the immediate availability
of these drugs and their approval for human use. The disadvantages are
the unknown effects of the repurposed drugs on SARS-CoV-2 and any
adverse effects they might have on COVID-19 patients. [Novel antiviral
drugs developed based on computational biology, structural biology, and
high-throughput screening can target novel signaling pathways and
explore novel molecules for inhibition of viral attachment, entry, and
replication.]{.underline} Examples of repurposed drugs for COVID-19 are
presented below and summarized in Table 12.1. Evidently the most famous
repurposed drugs are chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ),
originally developed as antimalarial drugs (Krogstad & Schlesinger,
1987). In parasites, HCQ interferes with the endocytosis and proteolysis
of hemoglobin resulting in inhibition of lysosomal enzymes. Furthermore,
HCQ inhibits stimulation of the toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), which can
result in inhibition of cytokine production and modulation of
costimulatory molecules. Despite initial promising reduction in viral
load in COVID-19 patients (Gautret, Lagier, & Parola, 2020), it quickly
became evident that the study design was poor and the results unreliable
(Lundstrom, 2020c). Recently, a systematic meta-analysis, 12
observational and 3 randomized trials including 10,659 patients,
revealed that HCQ did not generate a significant reduction in mortality,
time to fever resolution or clinical deterioration and development of
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Elavarasi, Prasad, & Seth,
2020). On the other hand, there was a higher risk of ECG
abnormalities/arrhythmia after HCQ treatment.

Table 12.1. Examples of drugs for COVID-19 treatment.

[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) has also been a common target for
the development of RdRp inhibitors as antiviral drugs against influenza
virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and
coronaviruses]{.underline} (Wang, Anirudhan et al., 2020), justifying
evaluation in COVID-19 patients. For instance, a molecular docking study
demonstrated the potency of remdesivir (RDV), ribavirin (RBV),
favipiravir (FPV) sofosbuvir, galidesivir, and tenofovir as antiviral
drugs against SARS-CoV-2 due to their high binding affinity to RdRp
(Elfiky, 2020). In the case of RDV, therapeutic efficacy has been
previously shown against Ebola virus (EBOV) in rhesus monkeys (Warren,
Jordan, & Lo, 2016). Related to coronaviruses, RDV antiviral activity
against HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV was demonstrated in
human cell lines and primary cells (Sheahan, Sims, & Graham, 2017).
Reduced viral loads for SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV (de Wit, Feldmann, &
Cronin, 2020) were seen in mice and macaques, respectively.

In the case of SARS-CoV-2, RDV blocked infection of Vero E6 cells (Wang,
Cao et al., 2020), and reduced virus titers and lung inflammation in
rhesus monkeys (Williamson et al., 2020). In clinical settings, RDV has
proven efficient in reducing the time of recovery of hospitalized
COVID-19 patients, having a positive impact on mortality rate decrease,
and reduction in respiratory tract infections (Beigel et al., 2020). The
FDA approved the use of RDV in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in October
2020 (Rubin et al., 2020).

The guanine analogue FPV selectively inhibits viral RdRp demonstrating a
broad antiviral range including influenza virus A, B and C, EBOV, and
Lassa virus. Combination of FPV with interferon-α (IFN-α) showed fewer
adverse events, shorter viral clearance time, and improvement in chest
computed tomography compared to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) in a phase
I clinical trial (Cai et al., 2020). In another study, FPV treatment led
to significantly higher recovery rates in comparison to umifenovir
(arbidol) treatment (Chen et al., 2020). Furthermore, FPV treatment of
COVID-19 patients provided clinical improvement in a retrospective
observational clinical trial in Thailand (Rattanaumpawan et al., 2020).
Early FPV administration showed better viral clearance in hospitalized
COVID-19 patients in Japan (Doi et al., 2020). Although the benefits
need to be confirmed in large randomized, controlled clinical trials,
FPV has been approved for commercial use in Russia, Bangladesh,
Pakistan, Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia (Joshi et al., 2021).

RBV is another guanosine analogue, which has demonstrated inhibition of
SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells (Unal et al., 2020). Hospitalized COVID-19
patients treated with RBV, IFN-β-1b, and LPV/RTV in an open-label,
randomized, phase II study showed a significantly shorter time (7 days)
from start of treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab test compared to
LPV/RTV therapy (12 days) (Hung et al., 2020). However, another
comparative study on intravenous RBV and supportive therapy in patients
with severe COVID-19 indicated neither improvement in negative
conversion time nor in mortality rates (Tong et al., 2020).

The potent RdRp inhibitor sofosbuvir was superior to RBV in a phase I
study showing a significantly shorter hospital stay and lower mortality
rates (Eslami et al., 2020). Compared to standard care alone (67%), the
clinical recovery was much better for COVID-19 patients receiving
sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (88%) and the duration of hospitalization 6 days
compared to 8 days for the control group (Sadeghi et al., 2020).
However, in another phase I trial, sofosbuvir/daclatasvir combined with
RBV showed no reduction in the duration of hospital stay, the number of
admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) or the number of deaths when
compared to standard of care (Abbaspour Kasgari et al., 2020).

The adenosine nucleoside analogue galidesivir blocks viral RNA
polymerase, showing promising inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in preclinical
studies (Ataei & Hosseinjani, 2020). However, results from early
clinical evaluation did not provide a benefit of galidesivir compared to
placebo, which led to termination of the study (BioCryst, 2021). The
ribonucleotide analogue EIDD-2801 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in
cultured human epithelial cells and in mice (Sheahan et al., 2020).
Moreover, EIDD-2801 showed significant reduction in viral load in the
upper respiratory tract in a ferret model (Cox et al., 2021). The
EIDD-2801 was well tolerated showing no serious adverse events in the
first-in-human phase I study in healthy volunteers (Painter et al.,
2021). Recruiting is in progress for a multicenter, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial in hospitalized
COVID-19 patients (The Safety of Molnupiravir, 2021).

Proteases such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLPro) (Moody & Ho,
2021), papain-like protease (PLpro) (Klemm, Ebert, & Calleja, 2020), and
helicase (Lpro) (White, Lin, & Cheng, 2020) play a vital role in
SARS-CoV-2 replication. 3CLPro presents an attractive target for
COVID-19 drugs as no human homologue has been identified. In this
context, boceprevir and calpain inhibitors inhibited SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells (Ma et al., 2020). Other
potential 3CLPro inhibitors are ombitasvir, paritaprevir, tipranavir,
ivermectin, and micafungin (Moody & Ho, 2021). Particularly, ivermectin
has received attention due to its antiparasitic and antiviral
activities. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells with ivermectin
showed over 90% reduction in viral RNA levels after 24 h increasing to
approximately 5000-fold after 48 h (Caly et al., 2020). In a pilot,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in nonsevere
COVID-19 patients no difference in the proportion of PCR positive
individuals were seen 7 days after treatment with ivermectin and placebo
(Chaccoura et al., 2021). A systematic review and meta-analysis based on
15 clinical trials showed neither reduced mortality nor reduced recovery
time in patients treated with ivermectin (Castañeda-Sabogal et al.,
2021). The design of the studies was far from optimal with a high risk
of bias and very low certainty of evidence. Therefore due to
insufficient certainty and poor quality of evidence ivermectin cannot be
recommended for COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Furthermore, the FDA
has not approved ivermectin for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. In
fact, the FDA has issued a warning that ivermectin is a veterinary
product and should not be used for human therapy (Bray, Rayner, & Noel,
2020).

In another approach, the X-ray structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro allowed
the design of the 13a and 13b pyridine-containing α-ketoamides, which
displayed favorable pharmacokinetic properties and strong lung tropism
in mice (Zhang, Lin et al., 2020). In addition to subcutaneous
administration, 13b subjected to inhalation provided high and
long-lasting concentration in mouse lung tissue. Moreover, the
combination of structure-based drug design, virtual drug screening and
high-throughput screening identified the N3 3CLPro inhibitor showing
irreversible inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 (Jin et al., 2020).
High-throughput screening of the organo-selenium compound ebselen
demonstrated antiviral and cell protection activity in
SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells. Moreover, the peptidomimetic aldehydes
11a and 11b exhibited significant antiviral activity in
SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells without any significant cytotoxicity (Jin
et al., 2020). Computer-aided drug discovery identified the
antipsychotic drug ziprasidone and antimigraine drug telcagepant as
covalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3 CLPro.

Another approach for COVID-19 drugs is to develop inhibitors against
PLpro, due to its vital involvement in viral replication. In a data
mining exercise of FDA-approved drugs, 147 potential SARS-CoV-2
inhibitors were identified (Kouznetsova, Zhang, & Tatineni, 2020).
Furthermore, ubiquitin, interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15),
and naphthalene-based PLpro inhibitors inhibited coronavirus replication
in Vero E6 cells (Bhati, 2020) and GRL-0617 reduced viral replication in
Caco-2 cells (Bhati, 2020).

In the context of the SARS-CoV-2 helicase Lpro, virtual screening of
970,000 chemical compounds identified lumacaftor and cepharathine as
potent inhibitors with IC50 values of 0.3 and 0.4 nM, respectively
(White et al., 2020). Lumacraftor has been postulated to act as a
chaperone for protein folding and cepharanthine has previously
demonstrated antiviral activity against SARS-CoV. Similarly, bananins
are potent SARS-CoV helicase inhibitors with IC50 values of 0.5--3 µM.
The high homology of 99.8% between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 helicases
makes helicase inhibitors potential targets for COVID-19 (Shin,
Mukherjee, & Grewe, 2020). Moreover, flavonoid phytomedicines such as
caflanone, equivir, hesperitin, and myricetin inhibit helicases and have
been suggested for therapy against COVID-19 (Lee et al., 2009). In this
context, quercetin (Lee et al., 2009), 7-O-arylmethylquercetin
derivatives (Park et al., 2012), and myricetin (Yu et al., 2012) have
demonstrated IC50 affinities between 2.7 and 8.1 µM against SARS-CoV
helicase. However, the poor bioavailability of flavonoids has restricted
their use in vivo (Thilakarathna & Vasantha, 2013), which has been
addressed by engineering nanoparticles or nanodrones for delivery
(Zhang, Cui, & Qu, 2019).

Herbal medicines, especially traditional Chinese medicines, have been
previously used for antiviral therapy and are currently investigated for
the treatment of COVID-19 (Pan, Dong, & Yang, 2020). For instance,
glycyrrhizic acid (GA) from the Chinese herb Glycyrrhizae radix has
demonstrated direct antiviral effect on hepatitis B virus (HBV) and has
shown some inhibitory effect on HIV proliferation (Sun et al., 2019).
Moreover, a retrospective clinical study in 73 SARS patients indicated
that GA improved the symptoms of dry cough, chest tightness, and
shortness of breath (Sun et al., 2019). Combination therapy of GA and
vitamin C has been approved for the treatment of COVID-19 in a clinical
trial in China (Zhao et al., 2020). Moreover, the active ingredient
shikonin in Arnebiae radix has demonstrated good inhibitory effect
against SARS-CoV-2. Traditional Chinese medicines such as Huoxiang
Zhengqi (HXZQ), Jinhua Qinggan Granule (JHQG), Xuebijing, and Huashi
Baidu (HSBD) possess antiviral activity and have been applied in
COVID-19 patients for relieving severe COVID-19 symptoms (Zhao et al.,
2020). However, additional well-designed clinical trials are needed to
confirm safety and efficacy.

Another interesting target for COVID-19 therapy comprise the
transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which has previously been
demonstrated to activate envelope glycoproteins of various viruses such
as EBOV, influenza virus, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV required for membrane
fusion and host cell entry (Sternberg et al., 2020). TMPRSS2 was shown
to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein priming and S
protein-driven cell entry (Yamaya et al., 2015). Camostat mesylate can
partially inhibit SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 infection in HeLa cells and
significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung Calu-3 cells
(Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, & Schroeder, 2020). Moreover, nafamostat
mesylate inhibited infection in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells. In a
case series, combination therapy of nafamostat mesylate and FPV in 11
critically ill COVID-19 patients in Japan resulted in successful removal
of seven patients from mechanical ventilation and release of seven and
nine patients from hospital and ICU, respectively, and only one death
(Doi, Ikeda et al., 2020). Moreover, nafamostat mesylate treatment of
three elderly COVID-19 patients needing supplementary oxygen showed
improvement (Jang & Rhee, 2020).

The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is certainly the main target for vaccine
development, but computational methods have also indicated that several
small molecule compounds acting as antihypertensive, antifungal,
antibacterial, and anticoagulant drugs show potent binding affinity to
the S protein, although not to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) binding region making them less attractive as targets against
COVID-19 (Wu, Liu, & Yang, 2020). Superimposing of the S protein
receptor-binding domain (RBD)--ACE2 complex on the hesperidin--RBD
complex, however, indicated that hesperidin may disrupt the RBD--ACE2
interaction and interfere with SARS-CoV-2 entry. Hesperidin, present in
citrus fruits, has been previously used as herbal medicine possessing
antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antiviral activities (Haggag et al.,
2020).

12.2. Monoclonal antibodies against COVID-19

[One area of COVID-19 drug development that has received much attention
lately is therapeutics based on monoclonal antibodies]{.underline}
(mAbs) (Shanmugaraj, Siriwattananon, & Wangkanont, 2020) (Table 12.2).
The mAb CR3022 previously developed against SARS-CoV has been analyzed
for its cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 (Tian, Li, & Huang, 2020).
Despite no overlapping with the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD, CR3022 showed potent
binding (Kd 6.3 nM) suggesting that CR3022 alone or combined with other
neutralizing antibodies could find prophylactic or therapeutic
applications against COVID-19. On the other hand, potent ACE2-targeting
SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies presented no binding affinity
for SARS-CoV-2 S. Therefore SARS-CoV-2 S-specific novel mAbs have been
engineered from a collection of 51 SARS-CoV-2 S hybridomas from
immunized H2L2 mice (Wang, Li et al., 2020). The 47D11 human mAb
neutralized both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells as well as
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-pseudotyped SARS-CoV. Moreover, 47D11
was shown to target the RBD of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. At least 14
mAbs or mAb cocktails have entered clinical trials, of which 5 are
currently in phase II/III studies (Tuccori, Ferraro, & Convertino,
2020). The S309 antibody identified from a convalescent patient, who had
recovered from SARS in 2003 (Pinto, Park, & Beltramello, 2020) also
neutralized SARS-CoV-2 as it binds to a highly conservative epitope in
the S protein. The VIR-7831 mAb was engineered to improve the
pharmacokinetic features and to extend the half-life of S309. Another
mAb, VIR-7832 has been engineered to act as a T-cell vaccine to kill
SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Vir Biotechnology and Biogen Execute
Agreement to Manufacture SARS-CoV-2, 2021). The COMET-ICE phase II/III
trial for VIR-7831 is currently recruiting patients with early-stage
COVID-19 (VIR-7831, 2021). In the lead phase, 20 patients with early
symptoms of COVID-19 will be enrolled and then the study will be
expanded to 1300 patients globally.

Table 12.2. [Examples of monoclonal antibody-based therapy against
COVID-19.]{.underline}

The fully human neutralizing IgG1 mAb LY-CoV555 (bamlanivimab) targeting
the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD showed the highest binding affinity among more than
500 antibodies (Tuccori et al., 2020). Moreover, the LY-CoV016
(etesevimab) targeting another SARS-CoV-2 S epitope was engineered
(Etesevimab and Bamlanivimab, 2006). The safety, tolerability,
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of intravenous LY-CoV555 have
been evaluated in a phase I trial in 24 hospitalized COVID-19 patients
(A Study of LY3819253, 2021). Furthermore, interim results from the
phase II BLAZE-1 study in 452 outpatients diagnosed with mild or
moderate COVID-19 indicated that doses of 700, 2800, or 7000 mg of
LY-CoV555 accelerated the natural decrease in viral load (Chen et al.,
2021). In a phase II/III clinical trial, 577 nonhospitalized COVID-19
patients receiving either LY-CoV555 monotherapy or combination therapy
with LY-CoV016 showed no difference in viral load between LY-CoV555
therapy and placebo (Gottlieb et al., 2021). In contrast, combination
therapy with LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016 provided statistically significant
reduction in viral load. Moreover, in the phase III ACTIV-3 clinical
trial, no significant differences in safety between LY-CoV555 and RDV
were recorded, but the study was discontinued due to the absence of
improvements in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (ACTIV-3, 21,
Bamlanivimab, 21). However, in November 2020, the FDA issued emergency
authorization for LY-CoV555 treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in
adult and pediatric patients (Coronavirus COVID-19, 2020).

High-throughput single-cell sequencing of convalescent blood samples
from recovered COVID-19 patients identified the BGB-DXP593 mAb (Cao, Su,
& Guo, 2020). Although the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization mechanism of
BGB-DXP593 is unknown, mAb binding has been proposed to the RBD of the S
protein. The safety and tolerability of three doses of BGB-DXP593 will
be evaluated in 180 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in a phase
II study (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, 2019).

In another approach, the REGN-COV2 mAb cocktail comprising REGN10987
(imdevimab) and REGN10933 (casirivimab) mAbs, which bind simultaneously
to different epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 S RBD, aims at providing both
protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections and treatment of COVID-19
patients (Hansen et al., 2020). Favorable results were obtained from
preclinical studies in golden hamsters and rhesus macaques, where
REGN-COV2 greatly decreased lung titers and reduced viral loads,
respectively (Baum et al., 2020).

In two phase II/III trials in adult hospitalized (Safety, 2021a) and
nonhospitalized (Safety, 2021b) COVID-19 patients, the efficacy of
REGN-COV2 virus shedding is compared to placebo. Interim results based
on data from 275 nonhospitalized patients demonstrated a good safety
profile and reduced viral load with greater efficacy in patients whose
immune response had not yet been initiated or who had a high viral load
at baseline (Weinreich, Sivapalasingam, & Norton, 2021). More data from
additional 524 outpatients confirmed that REGN-COV2 provided a 10-fold
reduction in viral load compared to placebo (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals,
2020). The phase III RECOVERY trial will evaluate the impact of the
REGN-COV2 mAb cocktail in comparison to LPV/RTV, HCQ, corticosteroid,
and azithromycin treatment on hospital stay and mortality (Mahese,
2020). At least 2000 patients will be enrolled in the trial and because
the two mAbs in REGN-COV2 target different domains in the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein the ability of mutant viruses escaping treatment will be closely
monitored.

The CT-P59 mAb binds to the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD, but with a different
orientation compared to other neutralizing mAbs (Kim et al., 2021).
Moreover, CT-P59 neutralizes the SARS-CoV-2 D614 G mutant. A randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I trial in 32 healthy volunteers
to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of CT-P59 has
demonstrated some positive interim results (Study to Evaluate the
Safety, 2021a). Moreover, another phase I trial in 18 patients with mild
COVID-19 symptoms is in progress (Study to Evaluate the Safety, 2021b).
Recently, a phase II/III was approved by the Korean FDA for safety and
efficacy evaluation in 1020 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19
disease (Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of CT-P59, 2021).
Moreover, phase I clinical trials for other mAbs targeting the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein such as JS016, TY027, BRII-196, BRII-198, and
SCTA01 have been initiated (Yang, Liu et al., 2020).

12.3. Vaccines against COVID-19

**[Related to prevention of COVID-19, vaccine development has played an
essential role.]{.underline}** [Different approaches include vaccines
based on inactivated or attenuated SARS-CoV-2, protein subunits and
peptides, viral vectors, and nucleic acids.]{.underline} At least 162
vaccine candidates have been subjected to preclinical studies, 52
vaccine candidates to clinical evaluation, and 6 vaccines have received
emergency use authorization (EUA) globally or in limited countries. The
current status is summarized below and in Table 12.3.

12.3.1. Inactivated and attenuated viruses

The inactivated vaccine candidate BBIBP-CorV induced robust SARS-CoV-2
specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits,
and macaques (Wang, Zhang et al., 2020). Protection against SARS-CoV-2
challenges was established in rhesus macaques after immunization with
two doses of 2 mg inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Another inactivated
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate induced neutralizing antibodies against 10
representative SARS-CoV-2 strains in mice, rats, and primates (Gao, Bao,
& Mao, 2020). Immunization of macaques with 3 and 6 μg of inactivated
SARS-CoV-2 provided partial and complete protection, respectively. In
clinical settings, an interim report from phase I and II trials
demonstrated only a low rate of adverse events and robust immunogenicity
responses in 96 individuals in the phase I part (Xia, Duan, & Zhang,
2020). Six hundred participants are enrolled in the phase II part of the
trial. In another study, 144 participants were immunized with the
inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (Zhang, Zeng, & Pan, 2021). The
vaccination on days 0 and 28 generated seroconversion of neutralizing
antibodies in 114 of 117 (97%) individuals receiving 3 μg of the vaccine
candidate, in 118 of 118 (100%) individuals immunized with 6 μg, and
none of 59 individuals in the placebo group. Furthermore, a phase III,
randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in
12,688 healthcare professionals (PROFISCOV) is in progress (Palacios,
Patiño, & de Oliveira Piorelli, 2020).

In the context of attenuated vaccines, a codon-deoptimized SARS-CoV-2
vaccine candidate (COVI-VAC) has been subjected to a phase I clinical
trial to assess the safety and immune responses, where 48 healthy adults
aged 18--30 years old will receive 2 doses of COVI-VAC 28 days apart, 2
doses of placebo, or 1 dose of COVI-VAC and 1 dose of placebo (Safety
and Immunogenicity of COVI-VAC, 2021).

12.3.2. Protein- and peptide-based vaccines

Recombinant protein expression technology has substantially facilitated
protein-based vaccine development. The SARS-CoV S RBD expressed in
Pichia pastoris yeast cells has been produced and purified under GMP
conditions (Chen, Du, & Chag, 2014). Immunization with the purified
RBD2919-N1 vaccine candidate elicited neutralizing antibodies and
protected mice against challenges with the SARS-CoV MA15 strain. Due to
high overall amino acid similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S
proteins and their RBDs, RBD2919-N1 might be repurposed for SARS-CoV-2.
In another approach, the multimeric repetitive assembly of capsid-like
particles (CLPs) used as molecular scaffolds for soluble vaccine
antigens (Aves, Goksøyr, & Sander, 2020) demonstrated that a CLP-based
vaccine candidate expressed in Drosophila D2 insect cells induced high
levels of SARS-CoV-2 S RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies in the same
range as has been detected in COVID-19 patients (Fougeroux, Goksøyr, &
Idorn, 2021). After booster vaccination, the virus neutralization titers
exceeded those obtained after natural infection. A phase I/II clinical
trial in 42 volunteers has been approved for safety evaluation
(https://www.adaptvac.com/news. Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2 S and the S-RBD
subunit expressed in human Expi293 cells have been used for
immunizations applying homologous or heterologous prime-boost regimens
in mice and primates (Tan, Juno, & Lee, 2021). The S protein was highly
immunogenic in mice, whereas the RBD subunit showed poor immunogenicity.
In contrast, both the S and RBD vaccine candidates were immunogenic in
macaques at levels superior to those found in convalescent COVID-19
patients.

Molecular clamp technologies have enhanced the immunogenicity of HIV Env
and influenza virus HA antigens by immunosilencing of a highly
immunogenic protein trimerization domain (Kim, Erdos, & Huang, 2020).
The experience from the codon-optimized MERS-CoV S1 subunit vaccine
fused with a foldon trimerization domain (Liang, Su, & Song, 2021)
supported the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit trimer in HEK293
cells, and the design of a microneedle array (MNA)-delivered SARS-CoV-2
S1 subunit trimer vaccine (Richmond et al., 2021). Potent
antigen-specific antibody responses were induced in immunized BALB/c
mice.

In another approach, a native-like trimeric subunit vaccine candidate,
S-Trimer, based on the Trimer-Tag technology has been developed for
SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., 2006). Vaccination with the oil-in-water
emulsion adjuvant As03 or the alum adjuvant CpG108 elicited robust
neutralizing antibodies and Th1-biased cellular immune responses in mice
and macaques. Furthermore, immunization with S-Trimer and adjuvant
provided protection against SARS-CoV-2 in macaques. The S-Trimer vaccine
candidate (SCB-2019) showed good safety and tolerability in a phase I
dose-finding clinical study in healthy volunteers in two age groups
(18--54 years and 55--75 years) (Study of Recombinant Protein Vaccine
Formulations Against COVID-19 in Healthy Adults 18 Years of Age and
Older, 2021). Coadministration of AS03 or CpG108 adjuvants elicited high
antibody titers, superior to titers in convalescent COVID-19 patients.

The baculovirus expression system was used for the expression of a
full-length and a truncated version of SARS-CoV S in insect cells (Zhou
et al., 2006). Immunization of mice with purified full-length and
truncated SARS-CoV S formulated with an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant
induced strong neutralizing antibody responses. Baculovirus-based
SARS-CoV-2 S has been subjected to phase I/II clinical trials in
volunteers aged 18--49 years old and in 55 years and older (Meng et al.,
2021). Although robust immune responses were obtained in the age group
18--49 years, impaired dose levels generated lower levels of
neutralizing antibodies in older individuals, which required redesign of
a planned phase IIb study.

In another strategy, the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD has been expressed in
Nicotiana benthamiana tobacco plants (Rattanapisit et al., 2020).
Currently, recruiting is in progress for a phase I clinical trial for
the purified SARS-CoV-2 RBD subunit vaccine KBP-COVID-19 administered
together with the CPG adjuvant in healthy volunteers aged 18--49 years
and 50--70 years (KBP-201 COVID-19, 2021).

Furthermore, the recombinant tandem-repeat dimer SARS-CoV-2 S RBD
vaccine candidate ZF2001 expressed in CHO cells has been subjected to
two phase I and II clinical trials (Yang, Li et al., 2020). Neutralizing
antibodies were found in all participants in phase I independent of used
dose (25 or 50 µg). In phase II, neutralizing antibodies were detected
in 97% of the individuals receiving a dose of 25 µg and in 93% receiving
50 µg of ZF2001. The neutralizing antibody titers exceeded those
detected in convalescent COVID-19 patients. The ZF2001 vaccine candidate
has been registered for a phase III study in 29,000 adults in China (A
randomized, double-blind, 2021).

The most advanced COVID-19 protein subunit vaccine candidate NVX-CoV2373
comprises the prefusion-stabilized full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein
expressed in Sf9 cells and administered with the Matrix-M1 adjuvant
(Tian et al., 2021). Immunization of mice resulted in high titers of
anti-SARS-CoV-2 S IgG, which inhibited ACE2 receptor binding,
neutralized SARS-CoV-2, and protected against SARS-CoV-2.
Multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T-follicular helper (Tfh)
cells, and antigen-specific B cells were elicited. Immunization of
baboons elicited high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies, inhibition
of ACE2 binding and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a phase
I/II clinical trial two intramuscular injections of 5 and 25 µg of
NVX-CoV2373 with or without Matix-M1 adjuvant administered 21 days apart
showed good safety and immunogenicity in healthy volunteers (Keech et
al., 2020). The adjuvant enhanced immune responses. Interim results from
a phase III study indicated that the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was 95.6%
effective against the original SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain, but also showed
good protection against the UK B.1.1.7 (85.6%) and the South African
B.1.351 (60%) variants (Mahese, 2021).

Peptide-based vaccine development has been subjected to
immune-informatics and comparative genomics approaches, so far. The
SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) protein was targeted for designing T-cell
epitope-based peptide vaccines (Abdelmageed et al., 2020). Ten potential
vaccine candidates were identified, which showed MHC class I and class
II binding and should be next validated in animal models. In another
approach, a multipeptide vaccine candidate based on computational data
contains an adjuvant, CTL, helper T-lymphocyte (HTL), and B-cell
epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 joined by linkers (Kalita et al., 2020). The 33
epitopes in the vaccine candidate originate from the SARS-CoV-2 S,
nucleocapsid (N), and membrane (M) proteins, which have prominent roles
in host receptor recognition, viral entry, and pathogenicity. Based on
in silico analysis, the vaccine should be nontoxic, nonallergic,
thermostable, and should elicit humoral and cellular immune responses.
Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the stabilization
of the vaccine candidate, which should next be evaluated in vivo.

12.3.3. Viral vector-based vaccine

Viral vectors have been frequently applied for vaccine development
against COVID-19 (Lundstrom, 2021). In preclinical settings, the
adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector expressing the codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2
S protein (Ad5-S-nb2) induced systemic and cell-mediated immune
responses and protected macaques from challenges with SARS-CoV-2 (Feng
et al., 2020). Moreover, expression of full-length SARS-CoV-2 S elicited
strong RBD-specific induction of mucosal IgA, neutralizing antibodies,
Th1-biased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in intranasally immunized mice (King et
al., 2020). In the case of Ad26 expressing the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S
protein, a single immunization of hamsters protected against pneumonia
caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Tostanoski et al., 2020). Furthermore, a
prime-boost regimen with Ad26 and Ad5 expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein (rAd26-S/rAd5-S) elicited robust immune responses in preclinical
animal models (Logunov et al., 2020). The strategy of using two
different Ad serotypes was to prevent immune reaction against the Ad
vector for the second immunization and to provide strong antigen
production. The simian adenovirus ChAdOx1 expressing the full-length
SARS-CoV-2 S protein elicited robust cellular and humoral responses and
protected immunized macaques against SARS-CoV-2 (Van Doremalen et al.,
2020).

The first-in human adenovirus-based COVID-19 phase I clinical trial
showed good safety, tolerability, and robust T-cell and humoral
responses after intramuscular administration of Ad5-SARS-CoV-2 S
particles (Zhu, Li et al., 2020). Furthermore, strong neutralizing
antibodies were obtained in a phase II trial with 5×1010 and 1×1011
Ad5-SARS-CoV-2 S particles (Zhu, Guan et al., 2020). Two phase III
trials in 40,000 and 500 healthy volunteers, respectively, are in
progress (Clinical Trial of Recombinant Novel Coronavirus Vaccine, 21,
Phase III trial of a COVID-19, 21). The Ad26-based vaccine was subjected
to a phase I/II study using only a single administration of 1×1010 or
5×1010 Ad26.COV2 S particles, which showed strong immune responses in
healthy volunteers (Sadoff et al., 2021). Furthermore, at least 2 phase
III trials with more than 60,000 participants are in progress (A study
of Ad26.COV2.S for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2-mediated COVID-19 in
adult participants (ENSEMBLE), 21, A study of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine
candidate for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2-mediated COVID-19 in adults,
21). The vaccine candidate rAd26-S/rAd5-S showed good safety with only
mild adverse events and robust immune responses in a phase I/II study
(Clinical Trial of Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity of Gam-COVID-Vac
Vaccine against COVID-19 RESIST, 2021). Several phase III trials have
been initiated (Clinical Trial of Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity
of Gam-COVID-Vac Vaccine against COVID-19 in Belarus, 21, Logunov et
al., 2021) and interim results from a phase III trial in 16,500
individuals showed good tolerability with 91.6% efficacy against
COVID-19 (Logunov et al., 2021). ChAdOx1 expressing the full-length
SARS-CoV-2 S protein (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) showed good safety and strong
immune responses in 32 of 35 vaccinees based on preliminary results from
a phase I/II study (Folegatti et al., 2020). After a booster
immunization all vaccinated individuals developed humoral and cellular
immune responses. In a phase II/III clinical trial 18--55 years old,
56--69 years old, and 70 years old and older individuals were immunized
with 2.2×1010 particles of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine candidate
(Ramasamy et al., 2021). Interim results demonstrated that adverse
events were more common in younger adults than in individuals older than
56 years. Similar levels of neutralizing antibodies were detected in all
age groups after two immunizations. Immunization with two standard doses
of 5×1010 ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 particles resulted in 62.1% efficacy, whereas
administration of a lower dose of 2.2×1010 particles followed by a
standard dose showed 90.0% efficacy (Voysey et al., 2021). The ChAdOx1
nCoV-19 vaccine received an EUA in December 2020 by the regulatory
authorities in the UK (Regulatory Approval of COVID-19 Vaccine
AstraZeneca, 2021). Similarly, the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was granted an
EUA by the FDA in February 2021 (Ad26.COV2-S FDA Approval Status, 2021).

In addition to adenovirus, lentivirus (LV) vectors have been applied for
vaccine development. Systemic administration of LV vectors expressing
SARS-CoV-2 S elicited strong antibody responses and provided partial
protection against SARS-CoV-2 in ACE2-humanized mice (Ku et al., 2021).
However, intranasal injection resulted in 3 log 10 decrease in viral
loads in mice lung and reduced local inflammation. A phase I/II study
applying a minigene-based LV vaccine is currently recruiting healthy
volunteers to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of subcutaneous
administration of 5×106 LV transduced dendritic cells (DCs) in
combination with intravenous antigen-specific CTLs (Immunity and Safety
of Covid-19 Synthetic Minigene Vaccine, 2021). Influenza virus vectors
have also been engineered as COVID-19 vaccine candidates by replacing
the neuraminidase (NA) gene by a membrane-anchored version of the
SARS-CoV-2 S RBD (Loes et al., 2020). A single intranasal administration
of the ΔNA(RBD)-Flu vaccine candidate elicited levels of
SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies comparable to those detected
in COVID-19 patients. Recently, the DelINS1--2019-nCoV-RBD-OPT1
influenza virus vector expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD was registered
for intranasal delivery in a phase I clinical trial in China (A Phase I
Clinical Trial of Influenza virus Vector COVID-19, 2021). In addition,
the intranasal spray approach was registered for a phase II study (A
Phase II Clinical Trial of Influenza virus Vector COVID-19 Vaccine for
intranasal Spray DelNS1--2019-nCoV-RBD-OPT1. ChiCTR2000039715, 2021).

Poxviruses have been frequently used as vaccine vectors and they have
therefore been considered for COVID-19. The modified vaccinia virus
Ankara (MVA) strain has been engineered for the expression of the
full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which elicited strong SARS-CoV-2
specific humoral and cellular immune responses and protected humanized
K18-hACE2 mice from SARS-CoV-2 challenges (García-Arriaza et al., 2021).
Furthermore, the first-in-human phase I clinical trial with two doses of
1×107 and 1×108 infectious units (IU) of MVA-SARS-CoV-2 S is recruiting
healthy volunteers (Safety, 2021c). In another application, a chimeric
Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vector expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein
generated strong binding and neutralizing antibody responses and
provided protection in immunized mice and hamsters (Sun, McCroskery et
al., 2020). Expression of full-length and membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 S
proteins from NDV elicited high levels of neutralizing antibodies and
rendered immunized mice resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infections (Sun, Leist
et al., 2020).

Measles virus (MV) vectors have been engineered for the expression of
the full-length SARS-CoV-2 protein and immunization of mice-elicited
Th1-biased antibody and T-cell responses (Hörner et al., 2020). The
MV-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate TMV-083 was envisioned for a phase I
trial in 90 volunteers for the evaluation of safety, tolerability, and
immunogenicity. However, initial findings indicated that the immune
responses in the vaccinees were weaker than those seen in COVID-19
patients, which led to the discontinuation of the study (Merck
Discontinues Development of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates,
2021).

Immunization of mice with replication-competent VSV vectors expressing
SARS-CoV-2 S generated neutralizing antibodies and offered protection
against SARS-CoV-2 (Brett et al., 2020). However, the VSV SARS-CoV-2 S
vaccine candidate V590 showed inferior immune responses compared to
levels seen in COVID-19 patients in a phase I clinical trial, which led
to the termination of the study (Merck & IAVI, 2021). In another
approach, the replication-competent VSV-ΔG with VSV G replaced by the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein-induced neutralizing antibodies and provided
protection in immunized golden Syrian hamsters (Yahalom-Ronen et al.,
2020). The VSV-ΔG vaccine candidate has been scheduled for a phase I/II
dose-escalation study in 18--55 years old volunteers (Evaluate the
Safety, 2021).

12.3.4. DNA-based vaccines

[DNA plasmids have been attractive vaccine vectors although innate
immune response against DNA and insufficient responses against expressed
antigens have limited their clinical application]{.underline} (Silveira,
Schmidt Garcia Moreira, & Mendonca, 2021). **[DNA-based expression of
the SARS-CoV-2 S protein generated robust expression in cell lines and
elicited neutralizing antibody responses]{.underline}** in immunized
mice and guinea pigs (Smith et al., 2020). Electroporation has
significantly enhanced the delivery efficacy of DNA-based COVID-19
vaccines (Xu et al., 2020). Moreover intradermal-electroporation (ID-EP)
of DNA vaccines enhanced immune responses through direct transfection of
dermal DCs destined for migration to draining lymph nodes (Amante,
Smith, & Mendoza, 2015). In another study, robust anti-N titers were
induced in New Zeeland White rabbits immunized with a DNA plasmid
expressing the codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 N gene (Ahlén et al., 2021).

The bacTRL platform applies genetically modified probiotic bacteria for
oral administration for colonization of epithelial cells in the gut for
plasmid-based constitutive replication and expression of antigens (Huo,
Le Bas, & Ruza, 2020). The bacTRL platform was employed for a
bifidobacterial monovalent SARS-CoV-2 S DNA vaccine (bacTRL-Spike) to
elicit SARS-CoV-2 S-specific cellular and humoral immune responses and
inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infections (https://www.symvivo.com/covid-19).
In addition, a trivalent vaccine candidate composed of SARS-CoV-2 S, N
and M proteins (bacTRL-Tri) has been engineered.

A dose-escalation phase I/II trial for the EP-aided GX-19 (SARS-CoV-2 S)
DNA vaccine candidate showed excellent safety, tolerability, and
immunogenicity (Safety and Immunogenicity Study of GX-19, 2021). A
preliminary report from a phase study for the INO-4800 DNA vaccine
showed either humoral or cellular immune responses, or both, in all 38
participants (Tebas et al., 2021). Recently, the INO-4800 vaccine
candidate has been subjected to phase II/III clinical trials applying
intradermal administration and electroporation to investigate safety,
immunogenicity, and efficacy (Safety, 2021d).

12.3.5. RNA-based vaccines

**[RNA-based vaccines are easily and rapidly engineered allowing
adjustments to novel variants and potential emerging
viruses]{.underline}** (Lundstrom, 2020b). However, RNA is sensitive to
degradation and requires low storage and distribution temperatures. The
RNA stability has been enhanced by prefusion-stabilizing mutations,
chemical modifications, and encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)
(Corbett et al., 2020). The prefusion-stabilized mRNA-1273 LNP vaccine
candidate, which encodes the SARS-CoV-2 S full-length protein-elicited
potent SARS-CoV-2 S-specific neutralizing antibody responses (Corbett et
al., 2020). Moreover, CD8+ T-cell responses were obtained, and immunized
mice were protected against SARS-CoV-2. Immunization of nonhuman
primates with 10 or 100 µg of the mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate induced
superior neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses compared to
those seen in convalescent COVID-19 patients (Corbett, Flynn et al.,
2020). Immunized primates were protected against SARS-CoV-2.

In another approach, two vaccine candidates containing
nucleoside-modified mRNA have been formulated in LNPs (Vogel et al.,
2021). BNT162b1 encodes the soluble secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 S RBD
and BNT162b2 the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein. A single
intramuscular injection of either vaccine candidate elicited strong
dose-dependent antibody and Th1 CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses.
[Prime-boost immunization of macaques showed 8.2--18.2 times higher
neutralizing antibody levels compared to titers detected in convalescent
COVID-19 patients.]{.underline} Moreover, immunization protected
macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenges. LNP-RNA with customized 5′ and
3′ end untranslated regions and the open reading frame of SARS-CoV-2
mRNA ensured optimal translation efficacy of the CVnCoV vaccine
candidate, which elicited robust SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing
antibodies in animal models (https://www.curevac.com/covid-19). Another
mRNA-LNP formulation, ARCoV, encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD elicited
robust SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice
(Zhang, Li et al., 2020). Th1-biased cellular responses were obtained in
both mice and primates. A prime-boost regimen provided complete
protection of mice against SARS-CoV-2. The liquid formulation of ARCoV
can be stored at room temperature at least for a week. RNA vaccines
based on self-amplifying Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus
expressing the prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S gene was formulated in
LNPs (McKay et al., 2020). Intramuscular immunization of BALB/c mice
induced higher titers of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies
than seen in COVID-19 patients.

A dose-escalation phase I trial for the mRNA-1273 vaccine identified no
trial-limiting safety issues, and SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses
were induced in all participants (Jackson et al., 2020). The phase I
trial was expanded to include 40 older adults, which showed only mild
adverse events and elicited superior binding and neutralizing antibody
titers with 100 µg of mRNA-1273 compared to a dose of 25 µg (Anderson et
al., 2020). The safety and immunogenicity were further confirmed in a
phase II study in 600 participants (Chu et al., 2021). A phase III trial
with 30,240 participants presented no safety concerns, only mild
transient local and systemic reactions, and the mRNA-1273 vaccine showed
94.1% efficacy, providing prevention of severe COVID-19 (Baden et al.,
2021).

The BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 vaccine candidates have been subjected to
several clinical trials. A phase I/II trial in 45 adults receiving 10,
30, and 100 µg of BNT162b1 showed dose-dependent mild-to-moderate
transient local and systemic reactions (Sahin et al., 2020). The
immunization elicited dose-dependent RBD-binding IgG and
SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody responses. The neutralizing antibody
titers were 1.9--4.6 times higher compared to titers from convalescent
COVID-19 patients. In another phase I/II trial in healthy 18--55 years
old volunteers, two doses of 1 or 50 µg of BNT162b1 elicited robust CD4+
and CD8+ T-cell responses (Mulligan et al., 2020). The
SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody titers were 0.7-fold (1 µg of
RNA) and 3.5-fold (50 µg of RNA) higher than in serum from convalescent
COVID-19 patients. BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 were evaluated in parallel in a
phase I study in younger and older adults (Walsh et al., 2020).
Immunization with BNT162b was associated with a lower incidence and
severity of systemic adverse reactions than BNT162b1 although they both
elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers. Based on
these data and previous studies, BNT162b was selected for phase II/III
clinical trials. In a phase III trial, 21,720 individuals were immunized
with BNT162b2 and 21,728 received placebo (Polack et al., 2020). Seven
days after the second immunization 162 COVID-19 cases were detected in
the placebo group and only eight cases in individuals vaccinated with
BNT162b2. The efficacy of COVID-19 prevention was 95%. In subgroups
defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body mass index and
preexisting conditions the vaccine efficacy was between 90% and 100%.
Both the mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccine candidates have received EUAs in
the USA, the EU, and many other countries (Dolgin, 2021). The LNP-mRNA
CVnCoV vaccine candidate has been subjected to a dose-escalation phase I
study for the evaluation of safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity
with doses of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 µg (A Study to Evaluate the Safety,
2021c). Moreover, a phase II dose-confirmation trial is in progress at
doses of 6 and 12 µg (A dose-confirmation study to evaluate the safety,
21). A phase II/III trial for CVnCoV with 35,000 participants in Europe
and Latin America started in December 2020 (A Study to Evaluate the
Safety and Immunogenicity of Vaccine CVnCoV in Healthy Adults in Germany
for COVID-19, 2021). Finally, a phase I clinical trial is in progress
for the LNP-saRNA vaccine candidate, which is administered at doses of
0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 µg (Clinical Trial to Assess the Safety of a
Coronavirus Vaccine in Healthy Men and Women, 2021).

12.4. Conclusion

**[Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 at the end of 2019 more than 5.3
million lives have been lost]{.underline}**. At the start of the
pandemic there were no antiviral drugs or vaccines available for
efficient treatment and prevention of COVID-19. However, today[, several
repurposed drugs can reduce the severity of disease and shorten hospital
stays]{.underline}. Engineering of mAbs has provided promising results
as therapeutics for COVID-19. **[The approval of two mRNA-based vaccines
globally and three adenovirus-based vaccines regionally is a
breakthrough to finally overcome the pandemic.]{.underline}**
**[Unfortunately, the story does not end here. Concerns have been raised
about not only the efficacy of the current vaccines, but also their
durability.]{.underline}** In a recent study, vaccinees followed for 119
days after receiving 100 µg of mRNA-1273 showed a slight expected
decline in titers, the vaccine provided durable humoral immunity (Widge,
Rouphael, & Jackson, 2021). **[Another issue relates to novel SARS-CoV-2
variants/mutations for which vaccine development needs to play catch-up
with]{.underline}**. Finally, cases of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic
thrombocytopenia (VITT) have been detected after vaccinations against
COVID-19 (Lundstrom, Barh, & Uhal, 2021). Although the cases are rare
and significantly lower than SARS-CoV-2-induced thrombocytopenia in
COVID-19 patients, it is an issue that needs to be addressed and
thoroughly investigated. As VITT has been detected after vaccination
with both adenovirus-based (Greinacher et al., 2021, Muir et al., 2021)
and mRNA-based (Lee, Cines, & Gernsheimer, 2021) [vaccines, various
hypotheses have been postulated, including the effect of the SARS-CoV-2
S protein, a common factor for both types of vaccines. These are areas
where we can demonstrate the power of biotechnology in healthcare in the
near future!]{.underline}

Introduction

Biotechnology, according to the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA),1
can be defined as any technique that uses living organisms (or their
parts) to obtain or modify products, improve plants and animals, or
develop microorganisms for specific uses. [Modern Biotechnology has a
wide application in the health industry, attracting interest from
scientists for production of drugs and vaccines, thus contributing to
the economic development and, especially, to growth of pharmaceutical
industry]{.underline}

[Science and technology complement each other, integrating basic and
applied sciences with other technologies such as molecular biology,
cellular biology, immunological techniques, biochemistry and microbial
fermentation processes]{.underline}

Advances in the industrial sector has brought many benefits to society,
but it is worth saying that, among several consequences, massive
migration of the population from countryside to urban centers has
occurred, diminishing quality of life due to lack of basic sanitation
and, consequently, causing more diseases for people and animals. In the
19th century, 80% of children died of various diseases before their 10th
birthday.3 In addition, millions of deaths have been recorded as a
result of human contamination by viruses and bacteria, causes of
diseases such as yellow fever, pertussis, smallpox, tetanus, diphtheria,
measles, polio, rubella, hepatitis, bubonic plague, cholera, rabies,
chickenpox, and mumps, which are among the most well-known diseases.

In order to control and prevent infections and diseases, scientists
discovered vaccines, which were based on the principle that the
individual's contact with the antigen produced an immune response.4 As a
result, several studies have been conducted to develop more effective
vaccines. **[Genetic manipulation established by modern Biotechnology
has modified in different ways research and development of these
vaccines, which have been classified as first second and third
generation.]{.underline}**

[First generation or traditional vaccines are produced with live
attenuated microorganisms, i.e., the weakened pathogen itself is
inoculated into the patient.]{.underline} Vaccines against smallpox,
polio, measles, rubella, adenovirus and tuberculosis can be included in
this type. **[Second-generation vaccines arose from the idea that
vaccines can be obtained by toxins produced by microorganisms that cause
diseases.]{.underline}** These toxins, called toxoids, can be
inactivated and become recognized by the host's immune system. They can
also be produced with purified polysaccharides. The recombinant proteins
are used as a source for the antigens to be incorporated into the
formulations.5 **[In the 1990s, third-generation vaccines emerged, in
which the material inoculated into the patient is not the attenuated or
dead pathogen, but its DNA containing the gene that encodes an antigenic
protein.]{.underline}** However, it is necessary to have an agent that
introduces DNA into the patient's cells, which are called DNA vectors,
for the vaccine to present any effect.

The history of vaccine, from its discovery by Edward Jenner in the late
18th century7 until the present day, has provided the world's population
with greater safety, health, and has undoubtedly saved billions of
people from various diseases. Vaccine production in Brazil deserves
special consideration, as the country is a global reference due to the
efforts of the National Immunization Program, Butantan and Fiocruz
Institutes

It is important to remember that the first vaccine reported was for
smallpox, discovered in 1789. This vaccine arrived in Brazil almost one
century later, in 1887, and, only in 1922, the Oswaldo Cruz Institute
began to produce it. Smallpox eradication became a goal by the World
Health Organization from the 1950s onwards, but it was eradicated only
in the 1970s. The BCG vaccine was discovered in 1909 and only began to
be used in Brazil in 1925. Production and use of the vaccine against
yellow fever started to be produced in 1937 in Brazil. Currently,
Fiocruz is the largest producer of this vaccine. The vaccine against
poliomyelitis, discovered in 1949 by Jonas Salk, was later developed for
oral application by Albert Sabin and started to be used in 1961. The
discovery of the vaccine against rubella occurred in 1969. In 1963, the
vaccine against measles was developed. In Brazil, this vaccine was
effectively implemented in 1973 with the National Immunization Plan
(NIP), but only in 1992 the fight against this disease was defined as a
public health policy priority. The second dose of the triple viral
vaccine (measles, rubella and mumps) was introduced in 2004

In addition, Brazil has adopted a successful vaccination strategy.8
Brazil's National Immunization Program (NIP) is considered one of the
most comprehensive among developing countries. For example, Brazil
received the poliomyelitis eradication certificate in 1994 and also
pioneered the introduction of rotavirus, conjugate pneumococcal,
meningococcal meningitis, and conjugate C serogroup vaccines in 2007,
and vaccination against the H1N1 pandemic influenza in the second half
of 2010.9 Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4 show the vaccination calendar in Brazil
for children, teenagers, pregnant women, and travelers, respectively.
Table 5 shows the calendar of national vaccination campaigns.

Objectives

The objectives of this work are to present the first-, second- and
third-generation vaccines as well as to make an analysis of the use of
these vaccines in Brazil.

Methodology For this review work, a survey of the articles with the
highest number of accesses and easy acquisition within databases such as
Google Scholar and PubMed was carried out. The method of bibliographic
research related to the subject was used and then the most relevant data
of the main themes related to Biotechnology and vaccines were collected.
The keywords used were: biotechnology, medicine, immunology and
vaccines.

Development Biotechnology [Biotechnology has contributed to a number of
significant changes in the area of biology and health, especially in the
field of genetics. Gene manipulation techniques, such as gene
sequencing, have altered scientific research for the health sector in
different ways]{.underline}. Some areas to which research is currently
focused are: synthetic biology (creation of "customized" organisms),
three-dimensional bioprinting and uses and applications in the area of
neurotechnology.1

**[The insertion of Biotechnology in the pharmaceutical industry has
enabled an increase in the number of therapeutic compounds, greater
knowledge of the processes causing diseases, more accurate diagnoses and
more efficient delivery mechanisms, such as recombinant DNA for
therapeutic protein production, hybridization for monoclonal antibody
production and techniques for cloning and manipulation of stem
cells.]{.underline}**

**[Another area of health that has benefited from technological advances
is the area of vaccines]{.underline}**. [Biotechnology has brought
changes in the way vaccines are produced, such as the discovery of new
antigens, adjuvants, vectors or delivery systems. The]{.underline}
production process of a drug or vaccine can be briefly divided into
three stages: a) production of the active ingredient, which is the
substance responsible for the therapeutic action; b) formulation, a
phase in which the active ingredient is mixed with other substances
(adjuvants) in order to adapt characteristics of the final product, such
as solubility, effect duration, stability, and absorption and
elimination by the body; and c) packaging, i.e., the packaging of the
finished product in quantities for final consumption.

[Many vaccines are still administered by methods created in the past
centuries. **It is expected from biotechnological advances that safer
and more effective vaccines will be produced and made available to an
increasing number of people**]{.underline}

**[The development of the third-generation vaccines (called DNA
vaccines) was possible due to technological advances in
Biotechnology]{.underline}**. Although their use in humans is not yet
approved, [such vaccines have been applied against diseases such as
cancer]{.underline}.4

Vaccine concepts Vaccination or immunization is the process of
developing the body's immunity or defense against infections with
antigens (substances that stimulate the body to produce antibodies
against the infectious agent -- viruses, bacteria or parasites).
Vaccines can be produced from dead or attenuated microorganisms or from
their components (first generation). However, in some cases, the disease
may occur due to a toxic substance produced by the microorganism. Then,
the vaccine needs to neutralize this toxin (second generation). In other
cases, however, the problem is not the virus or the bacteria, but the
quantity of them inside the host. Therefore, its multiplication must be
controlled.13 Figure 1 shows the three generations of vaccines

3.2. [The Present Situation of Vaccines Produced by Plant Biotechnology
That Target Respiratory Disease]{.underline}

[For respiratory disease, many plant-bases vaccine candidates are
available for a disease like Bursal disease virus, **influenza,**
Respiratory syncytial virus, **Streptococcus pneumoniae**, Bacillus
**anthracis**, Mycobacterium **tuberculosis**, and **asthma
\[**]{.underline}84\]. [These vaccines are safe and can be generated at
a low cost by using low-cost bioreactors. It can be administered orally;
hence, no antigen purification is needed, saving considerable production
costs.]{.underline}

A plant-based vaccine against infectious Bursal disease virus used
transient expression of VP2 in Nicotiana benthamiana \[85\]. Plant-based
vaccine for influenza used haemagglutinin (a surface glycoprotein that
is involved in influenza virus infection) and M1 protein (most abundant
structural matrix protein in the viral core) \[86,87,88\]. A pioneering
study in the plant by D'Aoust et al. \[88\] reported the production of
enveloped influenza VLPs. It opened the path for the large-scale
production of a VPL-based plant-based vaccine for H5N1 influenza with a
potential yield of up to 1500 doses per kg of infiltrated leaves
\[88,89\]. Another study reported the formation of VLPs by expression of
HAs from the strains A/Indonesia/5/05 (H5N1) or A/New Caledonia/7/2009
(H1N1). They were transiently expressed in N. benthamiana \[90\].

Another study reported enhanced immunogenicity of recombinant HA in an
enveloped VLP over soluble antigen \[91\]. Further studies expressed
different, HA antigens from A/Brisbane/59/07 \[HAB1 (H1)\],
A/Brisbane/10/07 \[HAB1 (H3)\], B/Florida/4/06 \[HAF1 (B)\], and
A/California/04/09 \[HAC1\], respectively) transiently in N.
benthamiana. 400--1300 mg protein obtained from 1 Kg of fresh
infiltrated leaf tissue \[92\]. Another study reported good
immunogenicity and safety profiles of HAC1 and HAI-05 in animal
pre-clinical studies \[93\].

Clinic trials of the HAC1 vaccine for the H1N1 virus were safe and well
tolerable with mild adverse events compared to placebo. This vaccine was
also immunogenic with the highest seroconversion rates based on virus
microneutralization antibody titers and serum
hemagglutination-inhibition \[94\].

One of the studies used a combination of a silica nanoparticle-based
(SiO2) drug delivery system with a plant-produced H1N1 influenza
hemagglutinin antigen (HAC1) and the mucosal adjuvant candidate
bis-(3',5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). This
vaccine induces systemic humoral immune responses in intratracheally
vaccinated mice \[95\].

The respiratory syncytial virus causes illness in the lower respiratory
tract in adults and children \[96,97,98,99\]. Recently, expressing the
RSV fusion (F) protein gene in transgenic tomato plants, a fruit-based
edible subunit vaccine against RSV was developed. In ripening tomato
fruit, the F-gene was expressed under the control of the fruit-specific
E8 promoter. Ripe transgenic tomato fruit orally administered to mice
led to the induction of mucosal and serum RSV-F specific antibodies
\[100\].

[Diseases caused by]{.underline} Streptococcus pneumoniae ([the
pneumococcus]{.underline}), Haemophilus [influenzae,]{.underline} and
Neisseria [meningitidis are responsible for almost two million deaths
each year the children are under five years old]{.underline}
\[101,102\]. Disease caused by S. pneumoniae remains high despite the
extensive use of pneumococcal vaccines. It is [mainly due to the absence
of serotypes in the vaccine]{.underline} \[103\]. **[A recent study
reported that plants could be engineered to synthesize bacterial
polysaccharides, and these polysaccharides can provide protective
immunity.]{.underline}** They also demonstrated this principle using the
serotype 3 capsular polysaccharide (a frequently isolated serotype from
disease cases) of S. pneumonia \[103\]. [Mice that are immunized with
the extracts from recombinant plants were performed better with a lethal
dose of pneumococci in a pneumonia mouse model, and the immunized mice
display significantly elevated antibodies of serum anti-pneumococcal
polysaccharide**. This study provides evidence that plant biotechnology
tools can successfully synthesize bacterial polysaccharides, and the
recombinant polysaccharides produced from them could be used as
potential vaccine candidates to protect against life-threatening
respiratory infections**]{.underline} \[103\].

**[Anthrax is another disease for which plant-based vaccines were
effective]{.underline}**. A Gram-positive bacterium, [Bacillus
anthracis, causes anthrax. Its spores remain viable even in the extreme
environment for centuries. Within the host cells, these spores produce
three-component anthrax toxins]{.underline}: edema factor (EF), lethal
factor (LF), and protective antigen (PA) \[104\]. Inhalation of spores
leads to B. anthracis via the respiratory tract leads to severe
respiratory distress causing cyanosis, shock, and death \[105\]. [Many
studies related to the heterologous expression systems, including
bacterial, viral, or plant systems, have been reported for
vaccines]{.underline} \[106,107,108,109\]. **[Due to their natural
bio-encapsulation protection from digestive enzymes, plant-based
vaccines improve immune response in the gut system by gradually
releasing the antigen]{.underline}** \[110,111\]. PA is the main
virulence factor to cause anthrax. Expression of PA in tobacco and
tomato generates lethal toxin neutralizing antibodies in a murine model
by intraperitoneal immunization \[112,113\]. Recently PA has been
expressed in mustard by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation since
mustard is commonly used as a stem and leaf vegetable and fodder meant
for cattle in various parts of the world. In orally immunized groups, a
specific mucosal immune response was observed.

Furthermore, in-vitro lethal toxin neutralizing potential indicated by
the antibodies conferred in-vivo protection against toxin challenge.
[The immunoprotective response was observed in mice during oral
immunization]{.underline} \[114\]. They use agroinfiltration plant
transient expression systems for engineered, expressed, purified, and
characterized full-length PA (pp-PA83) in tobacco plants. Immunization
with these vaccines protected all the rabbits from the lethal
aerosolized B. anthracis. The vaccine antigen formulated with Alhydrogel
retained immunogenicity even after two-week storage at 4 °C and was
stable (essential for clinical use) \[115\]. Anthrax protective antigen
(PA-D4) domain-4 epitope has a vital role in enhancing protective
immunity against virulent B. anthracis. One study successfully reported
a recombinant protein that comprised the antigenic PA-D4 integration
into the c/e1 loop of HBcAg in transgenic tobacco. Plant-derived
purified HB/PA-D4 protein injected into mice, and its sera display
significant anti-HBcAg and PA-specific IgG titers \[116\].

**[Plant biotechnology-based vaccines are also made to prevent the
infectious disease tuberculosis.]{.underline}** Mycobacterium
tuberculosis causes tuberculosis \[117\]. It can transmit from human to
human via droplets expelled into the air via an infectious person. Death
caused by TB even exceeded HIV, making it a more significant epidemic
than expected. To date, [seven oral plant biotechnology-based TB
vaccines have been extensively evaluated either in experimental or
pre-clinical and phase I clinical trials]{.underline} \[117\]. In
Potato, Ag85B, ESAT-6, MPT64, and MPT83 antigens are expressed \[118\];
in tobacco, Acr, and Ag85B antigens are expressed \[119\]; in
Arabidopsis thaliana, ESAT-6 fused to LTB and antigens are expressed
\[120,121\]; in carrot CFP10 and ESAT-6 antigens are expressed \[122\];
and in lettuce and tobacco, Mtb72F (Mtb32/Mtb39) and ESAT-6 fused to CTB
and its antigens expression in the chloroplast \[123\] (Table 4).

Table 4. Plant-based vaccines against respiratory disease.

[Asthma is also a chronic inflammatory disorder, where a plant-based
vaccine is effective. Asthma affects about 300 million people
worldwide.]{.underline} It is estimated that by 2025 asthma will affect
an additional 100 million people \[126\]. I[n one study, a genetically
modified narrow-leaf lupin]{.underline} (Lupinus angustifolius L.)
expressing a potential allergen (sunflower seed albumin) (SSA-lupin)
gene [was examined whether it can suppress the development of
asthma]{.underline}. The result indicated that SSA-lupin consumption
promoted an Ag-specific IgG2a Ab response via CD4+CD45RBlow T Cell and
IFN-γ -dependent mechanism \[124\].

In another study, transgenic Tg rice plants express in their seeds a
fragment (residues 45--145) of Der p 1 containing the significant human
and mouse T-cell epitopes. Oral administration of the Tg rice seeds to
mice inhibits the allergen-specific IgE responses and allergen-specific
T helper 2 (Th2) cytokine synthesis (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13). This
induction of oral tolerance was linked with inhibition of bronchial
hyper-responsiveness (BHR) \[125\]. In tobacco leaves, the recombinant
chimeric allergen R8 was successfully expressed. In the herbaceous leaf
extracts, a pro-peptide was observed. This protein displays properties
the same as tobacco with respect to IgE immune reactivity or the
parental allergen ProDer f 1 that is expressed in Escherichia coli
\[127\].

**[Since SARS-CoV2 is also a respiratory disease, developing a new
plant-based vaccine study mentioned above can significantly impact
it.]{.underline}** There are already some applications by Medicago Inc.,
using the same virus-like particle platform, which it has used for a
plant-based vaccine for H5N1 influenza in the study mentioned earlier.

[Plant biotechnology-based vaccines are becoming a reality, even though
their progress has been slower than expected. It is particularly true in
oral vaccines, having the main drawbacks of poor reproducibility, a
question mark in antigen stability, and bioavailability]{.underline}
\[128,129\].

**[Plant biotechnology allows foreign protein expression in plants and
projects a short-term approach for a potential vaccine candidate for
SARS-CoV-2]{.underline}**. The method of this expression will depend
upon the nature of the targeted antigen. In the following section, we
have discussed the idea of using a plant biotechnology bases platform as
a possible approach for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development (Figure 2).

express target antigens by either stably or transiently transformation,
enabling scientists to use different immunization
approaches]{.underline}**. The transient transformation method enables
high antigen protein yields in the transformed plants purified to obtain
injectable vaccines or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. [In a stable
genetic transformation method, the edible plant species can provide oral
vaccine formulations such as; capsules or tables with antigens from
freeze-dried leaves]{.underline}. They can also be applied as a boosting
agent. This figure is prepared by using Biorender

#### Synthetic biology is the future of vaccines. It produces cheaper vaccines that are more response to pathogens and easier to circulate globally.

Imperial College London, Co-director of the EPSRC Center for Synthetic
Biology and Innovation at Imperial College London. \[Richard I.,
Jennifer Bell, Jim Philp. "Build a Sustainable Vaccines Industry with
Synthetic Biology." Trends in Biotechnology, Vol 39, Issue 9, pages
866-874. Jan 8, 2021.\]

[The vaccines industry has not changed appreciably in decades regarding
technology, and has struggled to remain viable, with large companies
withdrawing from production. Meanwhile, there has been no let-up in
outbreaks of viral disease, at a time when the biopharmaceuticals
industry is discussing downsizing]{.underline}. The distributed
manufacturing model aligns well with this, and the advent of synthetic
biology promises much in terms of vaccine design. Biofoundries separate
design from manufacturing, a hallmark of modern engineering. [Once
designed in a biofoundry, digital code can be transferred to a
small-scale manufacturing facility close to the point of care, rather
than physically transferring cold-chain-dependent vaccine]{.underline}.
Thus, **[biofoundries and distributed manufacturing have the potential
to open up a new era of biomanufacturing, one based on digital biology
and information systems. This seems a better model for tackling future
outbreaks and pandemics.]{.underline}**

The Vaccine Production Model Needs to Change

[The COVID-19 crisis has cast the vaccines industry into
scrutiny]{.underline} \[1\]; an industry that has been silently
beleaguered for decades

A [United States National Academy of Sciences study]{.underline} from
2003 \[2\] [concluded that the amount that the nation spent on vaccines
'appears to be insignificant compared with that spent on other medical
and social interventions that may have lesser social
benefits.']{.underline} Large company numbers that supply vaccines have
steadily reduced \[3\]: some 80% of vaccines arise from five
multinationals. [At the heart of the problem is a tension between
relatively poor financial returns to the vaccine industry and the high
costs in production and R&D]{.underline} \[4\].

Compared to small molecule pharmaceuticals, **[centralised vaccine
production facilities are capital intensive]{.underline}** \[5\]. Fixed
costs are high \[6\], especially for new vaccines. [For example, the
need for eggs for production is at least 70 years old, is expensive and
time-consuming, but difficult to replace]{.underline} \[7\]. In past
high-income countries have paid a higher price until the fixed costs are
amortised. Then lower-income countries have adopted vaccines as the
price has dropped after paying the fixed costs. However, there is now
tremendous pressure for a COVID-19 vaccine to be available for all who
need it, effectively everyone.

**[Distributed Manufacturing, a More-Sustainable Vaccine
Model]{.underline}**

[The long distribution chains of centralised vaccine production are
patchy, resulting in incomplete geographical coverage]{.underline} \[8\]
(Box 1). Even if there is no overall shortage, there may be where they
are needed most. [Centralisation of labour and production has been the
norm in many industries, but in 2015 the World Economic
Forum]{.underline} (WEF, see Glossary) [put distributed manufacturing in
its top ten emerging technologies for the year]{.underline}
(https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/03/top-10-emerging-technologies-of-2015-2/).
In essence, production is done close to the final customer, and much of
the material supply chain is replaced by information \[9\]. It appears
unsuited to high-production-volume industries, such as commodity
chemicals and the automotive industry. However, [vaccine production,
already suboptimal for economies of scale \[10\], needs a different
model, and distributed manufacturing is a good fit.]{.underline}

Box 1

Scaled-Down Manufacture and Supply Chain Close to Points of Care

[Although revenues from vaccine sales are higher in developed countries,
greater volume of sales occur in low- and middle-income countries.
Nevertheless, vaccine manufacturers in developing countries already
supply over half of the vaccines in their immunisation
programmes]{.underline} \[50,51\], so this initiative is far from
needing to be started from scratch.

Given the large number of doses that are possible from small volumes of
product, final production could happen in a variety of locations if they
comply with regulations: adapted university laboratories; laboratories
at university teaching hospitals; and small company facilities at
science parks and medical campuses. As cold chain operations are
especially challenging in remote locations, it may even be possible to
manufacture in mobile laboratories (Figure I), extending their
capabilities of early warning, reconnaissance, on-site investigation,
verification and response that already exist \[52\]. German company
CureVac is developing a mobile production unit, the RNA Printer
(https://www.curevac.com/en/technology/production/) that will be
deployable to hospitals, potentially even into mobile laboratories. A
joint patent application has been filed between CureVac and Tesla, the
electric vehicle manufacturer, for this 'Bioreactor for RNA In Vitro
Transcription' \[53\].

In one scenario, the [vaccine sequence could be sent electronically
across a telecommunications network from a biofoundry that has designed
the sequence to another biofoundry that is the manufacturing
facility]{.underline}. [The second biofoundry then produces the liquid
vaccine preparation for transportation]{.underline}. Further
transportation could then be achieved using a mobile vaccination
facility built into a mobile truck unit specially kitted out for this
purpose. A recent example of this has been achieved by the Dutch
company, Lamboo Mobile Medical, in partnership with Phillips
(https://www.mobile-medical.eu/projects/mobile-primary-care-truck-unit-delivered-south-africa).
A similar facility could be designed for local vaccine transportation to
the point of immunisation. Any attempt to use mobile laboratories or
production plants in multiple locations during a pandemic would require
manufacturing best practices, like those outlined in good manufacturing
practice (GMP), harmonised standard operating procedures and
certification \[52\]. Training of staff in the correct use of a mobile
biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory has in past been sponsored by the
WHO
(https://www.afro.who.int/news/who-supports-mobile-bsl-3-lab-re-qualification-and-training-experts).

The thermal stability of vaccines for worldwide distribution is a major
problem, particularly in developing countries and outlying geographical
regions. The ideal situation is for a vaccine to be stable for long
periods at ambient temperatures. However, in reality, estimates vary
widely for different types of vaccines regarding storage and transport
temperatures. A big disadvantage of RNA vaccines is that their stability
is lower than traditional vaccines \[54\]. Thus, their production close
to the end user is especially pertinent.

Figure I. Mobile Laboratory Configuration for the Diagnosis of Ebola
Virus Disease.

In 2014, a mobile Biosafety Level-3 (BSL-3) laboratory was sent from
China to Sierra Leone during an Ebola virus disease outbreak to rapidly
diagnose the disease using quantitative real-time PCR. In a 2-week
period, 1635 patients were evaluated and none of the laboratory staff
members became infected. Communication, ventilation, and electricity and
gas supply formed part of this infrastructure, comprising three
vehicles. This infrastructure could include distributed manufacturing
functions. Image adapted from \[55\].

Nucleic acid vaccines would be produced in kilogrammes rather than
tonnes. **[An mRNA vaccine may have a low-cost, cell-free, egg-free
production process \[11\] that is highly scalable and is easier to build
and run than a facility handling virus particles. T]{.underline}**he
actual production process could be relatively simple, consisting of a
small number of standardisable molecular biology steps, purification by
HPLC and final drug formulation \[12\]. Upon delivery to the patient,
the process is completed there, with translation of the message to
immunogenic protein in ribosomes, which then encounters the host's
immune system. While an oversimplification, compare this with standard
vaccine production processes that might involve hundreds of complicated
steps.

Economically, locating production close to the end user has the highest
potential to capture value, particularly for emergency preparedness and
response \[13\]. The need for a cold chain, prone to logistics
malfunctions and temperature excursions
(https://pelibiothermal.com/resource/active-versus-passive-shipping-containers-making-optimum-choice)
\[14\], is almost completely removed. Most importantly, a small
production facility situated close to an outbreak site can, potentially,
fill the gap between routine production and precipitous need at the
onset of outbreak creating a stockpile in a short timeframe \[15**[\].
The design and manufacture of mRNA vaccines also offers the critical
advantage of being a fully synthetic platform process \[16\] for
multiple targets \[12\]. This will be an important aspect of creating a
future industry that is economically viable. It may then be a quicker
process to optimise the product for the next virus
outbreak.]{.underline}**

[The Synthetic Biology Approach Lends Itself to a Distributed Vaccine
Industry]{.underline}

[Vaccine technology is decades old and in need of
modernizing]{.underline}. One of the problems is that, while many
nonbiological drugs are produced using standardised chemical engineering
processes, vaccine production, especially with whole cells, has been
less amenable to standardisation and is thus less predictable. To break
the economies-of-scale model for vaccine manufacturing, cost savings
have to be made through strain engineering and molecular design
\[17**[\]. This is fertile breeding ground for the emerging synthetic
biology industry]{.underline}** \[18\].

[Vaccine production would benefit from the systematic workflow approach
of synthetic biology \[19\]. The technology of mRNA is amenable to
optimisation through almost limitless combinations of
derivatives]{.underline} \[12\]. Likewise, [the biofoundry is an obvious
vehicle for generation of these combinations.]{.underline} Systematic
workflow increasingly involves the use of biofoundries. [Biofoundries
are highly automated facilities that comprise the extensive and
coordinated use of laboratory robots that are programmed to perform
specific tasks according to a workflow]{.underline} \[20\]. Typically,
different platforms within the biofoundries perform different tasks; for
example, liquid handling, genetic assembly, characterisation functions.
Biofoundries are based on information infrastructures that allow the
robots and other equipment within the biofoundries to be programmed to
follow detailed, complex workflows \[21\].

**[The combination of biodesign tools (BioCAD) and biofoundries is
rapidly producing a new type of biology -- digital biology -- that could
revolutionise the production of vaccines and many other areas of
biomedicine]{.underline}**. The approach chimes with the distributed
supply chains and distributed manufacturing that could be transformative
in dealing with COVID-19 and future pandemics throughout the world[. The
potential of the approach was demonstrated by Crone and co-workers
\[22\] who showed that an automated SARS-CoV-2 clinical diagnostics
platform designed and developed in a biofoundry can be quickly deployed
and scaled.]{.underline}

Software allows the simultaneous investigation of a range of
experimental factors or variables to rapidly optimise design of an
industrial production. The recently formed Global Biofoundries Alliance
\[23\] has publicly funded biofoundries in North America, Europe, Asia,
and Australia, which could be brought to bear for the design of new
vaccines, as needed. As pointed out by Crone and co-workers \[22\], the
protocols and workflows they developed can be quickly incorporated and
modified as necessary by members of the Global Biofoundry Alliance. Box
2 shows front-running approaches to vaccine production that are highly
amenable to the synthetic biology approach. They are all ripe for
public--private cooperation.

Box 2

Vaccines Amenable to the Synthetic Biology/Distributed Manufacturing
Approach

[RNA vaccines work by introducing a biodesigned mRNA sequence into
muscle or other cells. The mRNA is specifically designed to produce the
exact antigens required to counteract the target virus. There are a
number of advantages of this approach. Production/manufacture can be
achieved directly in the laboratory, cell free and egg
free]{.underline}. One litre of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could be enough to
produce at least 1 million doses. **[The big potential advantage of the
method is that it is amenable to synthetic-biology-based biodesign,
where knowing the genome of the virus allows the direct design of an RNA
vaccine.]{.underline}** Ulmer and co-workers \[56\] described a proof of
concept for the production of a self-amplifying mRNA influenza vaccine,
from gene synthesis to formulation and release, in 13 days, which they
anticipated could be reduced to 5 days.

DNA vaccines are also amenable to synthetic biology design but
production is more complex than RNA vaccines if there is a dependence on
amplification of plasmids in bacterial or cell cultures. Both DNA and
RNA platforms use similar established production processes and
facilities. **[An entirely synthetic, in vitro process for mRNA vaccines
is inherently simpler and easier to monitor.]{.underline}** However, the
arrival of enzymatically produced linear DNA provides some key
advantages, not least being speed of production free of bacterial
sequence \[57\], and may herald new opportunities for DNA vaccines.

[Programmable and modular synthetic gene circuits can be introduced into
adenoviral vectors for immunotherapeutic purposes]{.underline} \[58\].
The COVID-19 vaccine under development at the University of Oxford is an
adenovirus vaccine vector (ChAdOx1). The Oxford group had previously
developed a successful vaccine for SARS. The strategy was that, as SARS
is another form of coronavirus, it should be possible to modify that
vaccine for COVID-19[. The advantage of the methodology is that
conventional production techniques should be readily modified for the
production of the new vaccine.]{.underline}

A virus-like particle (VLP) is an engineered viral structure with the
immunoprotective traits of a native virus but is noninfectious. When
synthetic biology techniques are applied to the rational design of VLPs
greater precision and predictability is achievable. It is now possible
to screen for pathogen-specific antigens with high immunogenic potential
for inclusion in the design \[59\].

Rapidly multiplying a little-known plant virus (cowpea mosaic virus,
CPMV) in plants is a potential solution to vaccine production \[60\].
CPMV is used to produce a noninfectious viral shell VLP. In the case of
influenza, genetic information from the human virus decorates the shell
with influenza surface proteins. In relation to COVID-19, the Canadian
biopharmaceutical company Medicago, having produced the appropriate VLPs
for coronavirus, began testing its plant-based coronavirus vaccine in an
early-stage clinical trial in July 2020. The production 'factory' is a
plant related to the tobacco plant. Using plants as the production
factory could prove more rapid and scalable than conventional methods.
Medicago recently announced the construction of a facility to grow
plants with a capacity for 40--50 million planned doses of flu vaccine
per year \[61\].

4\. [Scope of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Development Using Plant
Biotechnology]{.underline} Platform

Nanoparticles (NPs) and virus-like particles (VLPs) are the protein
structures that have similarities with native viruses but do not contain
a viral genome nor have any infectious ability, thus creating a safer
platform for vaccine candidates \[130\]. Both NPs and VLPs constitute
self-assembling proteins that display the epitope of interest at a
higher density at their surface. Nanoparticles must have the antigenic
epitopes repetitive and so that the innate humoral immune system and B
cells are activated \[131,132,133\]. NPs/VLPs support antigen uptake by
antigen-presenting cells (APCs), enhancing the immune system's adaptive
arms \[134\]. [In the 21st century, many platforms for NPs/VLPs design
have been evolved, including the usage of site-specific ligations-driven
covalent links of individual folded proteins, viral core proteins, and
non-covalent intramolecular formation of de novo protein nanostructure
via intermolecular interactions. Both self-assembled protein **NPs and
VLPs offer highly stable, ordered, and monodisperse vaccine formulations
and upscale production with bio farming**]{.underline}. For the new
vaccine development, NPs/VLPs are currently recognized as the most
studied promising molecular carriers \[130\]. To develop VLPs Medicago
Inc. (Quebec City, QC, Canada) used the Nicotiana benthamiana plant
\[135\]. [Medicago's plant-derived COVID-19 vaccine candidate along with
GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) pandemic adjuvant have entered into the phase
2/3 clinical trials.]{.underline} Medicago's plant-derived vaccine
candidate against COVID-19 uses Coronavirus-Like-Particle (CoVLP)
technology in which vaccine composed of recombinant spike (S)
glycoprotein and is expressed as virus-like-particles (VLPs). It is
co-administered with GSK's adjuvant. Two doses of 3.75 micrograms of
CoVLP are administered 21 days apart. Data shows that the combination of
the vaccine candidate and GSK's pandemic adjuvant-induced a significant
humoral immune response after two doses. Similar antibody responses were
observed in younger and middle-aged adults, as well as elderly adults.
(https://www.medicago.com/en/newsroom/;
https://ir.ibioinc.com/press-releases;
https://news.cision.com/expres2ion-biotechnologies, accessed on 12 June
2021) \[136\]. Kentucky BioProcessing, Inc. (KBP) (formally known as
Large Scale Biology Corp.) candidate vaccine, COVID-19 Subunit Vaccine
KBP-201, is in the 2nd phase of clinical trials. They have used
Nicotiana benthamiana as a host plant/expression system. Both candidate
vaccines have two doses scheduled after 21 days gap. They can be
administered via the intramuscular route (Table 5). There are four other
candidate vaccines from iBio, Inc. (New York, NY, USA), Akdeniz
University (Turkey), Shiraz University (Iran), and Baiya
Phyto-pharm/Chula Vaccine Research Center (Thailand) that are in the
pre-clinical stage and have used the plant as an expression system. Many
reports explain the role of NPs in SARS-CoV-2 in detail
\[136,137,138,139,140,141,142\].

Table 5. Current status of WHO listed plant-based vaccine candidates for
COVID-19 under trial stages.

Table

For the production of VLPs, several studies target Poliovirus, hepatitis
B virus, human papillomavirus, influenza virus, Norwalk virus, human
immunodeficiency retrovirus 1, rift valley fever virus, and foot and
mouth disease virus
\[132,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158\]. Earlier
experience of forming VLPs for MERS and SARS-CoV-1 antigens heterologous
expressed in recombinant systems provides us the best platform for
developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. A study reported that in
morphology, developed VLPs were similar to the virions of SARS-CoV-1.
Another report stated that envelope proteins (E) and membrane (M) are
sufficient enough for the efficient formation of virus-like particles,
and they could be visualized by electron microscopy \[159\]. VLPs formed
by membrane proteins of different origins activated immature dendritic
cells (DCs) and enhanced the secretion of cytokines and co-stimulatory
molecules' expression \[160\].

Mucosal routes have emerged as attractive and promising routes for the
vaccination of respiratory diseases. Mucosal immune response for VLPs is
an essential aspect of vaccine success. In one study, mice were
immunized with VLPs plus cytosine--phosphate guanosine (CpG) and VLPs
intranasally. Both of them induced IgG specified to SARS-CoV1 \[161\].

Given that HA protein expression in plant-made VLPs vaccine successful,
similarly, it is believed that for the development of SARS-CoV-2 VLPs, S
protein expression might be necessary. Considering this, targeting the
trans-Golgi secretion route by nuclear expression might yield a protein
that, via secretion and glycosylation process, can produce VLPs for
SARS-CoV-2 \[162\]. Forty-seven plant-based candidate VLPs vaccine has
been developed for a wide range of disorders \[163\].

5\. Concluding Remarks and Future Direction

There are a few risks that might be involved with the plant
biotechnology platform-based vaccine \[164\]. Their risks include (1)
Oral tolerance; if the antigen is delivered too frequently, the mucosal
immune system becomes desensitized to the candidate vaccine, and the
vaccination might no longer tackle susceptibility to the target disease.
(2) Allergenicity; compared to the natural pathogen in plants, a
transgenic product might be undergone by different post-translational
modifications, which might induce new allergenic responses in the host
during vaccination. Along with this, the use of oral adjuvants for
mucosal linings stimulation might induce hypersensitive responses to
other food proteins \[165,166\]. (3) Gene transfer; transfer of the
antigen to the conventional food supply through genetic engineering
could lead to oral tolerance. (4) Detrimental effects on the
environment; natural loss and degradation of a gene during selection
within the environmental system. The transgene is randomly inserted into
the genome during gene transfer, which can lead to positional effects.
These events make expression levels unpredictable, and the loss of
endogenous genes is also a possibility that might leads to toxicity or
allergenicity implications. Advancements in technologies can solve these
limitations by providing alternative methods to achieve site-directed
mutation through many mechanisms \[78\]. (5) Inconsistent dosage; an
insufficient amount of antigen might not produce the desired immune
response needed to protect against the deadly disease. Incorrect
frequency or wrong dosage could lead to tolerance and reduce vaccine
effectiveness in some candidates \[167,168\]. To overcome this
limitation, proper clinical trials in animals and humans must determine
the doses to generate a proper immune response.

[COVID-19 outbreak led to a global health emergency that demands new
vaccines to cope with this pandemic]{.underline}. **[Plant
biotechnology-based vaccine candidates offer an alluring approach for
containing this virus]{.underline}**. The available expression platform
offers relevant directions for developing a candidate vaccine for
COVID-19. The deconstructed viral vectors transient expression system is
one of the alternative approaches for vaccine production where the
tobacco as a host plant will allow for fast exploitation of plants as
efficient large-scale biofactories for injectable vaccine candidates. A
major disadvantage of this strategy is the potential loss of exogenous
genes and ultimately loss of systemic infectivity. However, this can be
prevented by using a subgenomic promoter derived from a different virus.
It will lead to heterologous genetic recombination. Currently, six
front-runner plant-based vaccines are based on this platform (Table 5).
VLPs vaccine is another alternative option that provides an attractive
approach for producing safe and efficient vaccines, which lacks
replicative capacity, preserve antigenic determinant, and have high
immunogenicity. VLPs based vaccines platform cannot be used for all
types of viruses, which might be a major drawback for this technology.
However, if its advantage is taken into consideration, the VLPs vaccine
has vast potential. VLPs platform already has a proven track record in
the case of earlier SARS-CoV-1. Hence, VLPs development based on
different SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins is an excellent approach
against COVID-19. [Another approach is to develop vaccines based on
edible plant species that are transformed at the nuclear level and
administered as oral vaccines. It will provide mucosal
immunity.]{.underline}

[In 2020, the market size of global plant-based vaccines was estimated
to be valued at 927.0 million USD, and in the next six years, it is
expected to witness a growth rate of over 11.7%.]{.underline}
**[Existing key players and new entrants in the plant-based vaccines
market now focus on extensive clinical trial studies to develop
plant-based vaccines for numerous therapeutic applications, including
the COVID-19 vaccine]{.underline}**. For example, Medicago Inc., a
clinical-stage Canadian biotechnology company, uses plant-based
technologies to develop and produce many novel vaccines and antibodies
by cultivating several tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum) at its
Durham's Research Triangle Park in North America. This facility will be
used in the testing and large-scale production of the flu vaccine. To
develop the flu vaccine, Medicago conducted phase 3 clinical trials in
March 2018. It is expected to be launched in the market soon during
influenza season.

**[It requires almost five to six weeks to produce a plant-based vaccine
compared to a five to six-month period preparing the vaccine in chicken
eggs, which the various vaccine manufacturers are currently
practicing.]{.underline}** Along with these developments, [monoclonal
antibody production in plants can also provide another alternative
plasma transfusion strategy.]{.underline} **[Antibodies developed in
plants will be affordable and have safer intravenous treatment for
critically ill patients]{.underline}** (Figure 2[). There are already
approved plant-based vaccines for influenza that give hope to the
potential of plant-based anti- COVID-19 vaccine]{.underline}. The
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) estimated that
global vaccine manufacturing capacity would be only 2--4 billion doses
annually, and by 2023--2024, not enough vaccines can be manufactured to
meet global demands. This capacity might also be product-specific, along
with some limitations: for example, whole-inactivated virus vaccines
must be manufactured in a facility with biosafety level 3-capability. In
addition to this administrative, the regulatory process of licensing,
technology transfer, and the scale-up of vaccine manufacturing,
purification or formulation might be time-consuming, and fulfilling
these requirements in a time-bound manner will remain challenging. A
plant-based vaccine platform can fill the gap and help maintain the
demand/supply ratio. The coming years will be crucial to see the real
potential of a plant-based vaccine for COVID-19 or any other pandemic.

[A decade ago, the conventional wisdom held that the world was on the
cusp of a new era of cyberconflict in which catastrophic computer-based
attacks would wreak havoc on the physical world.]{.underline} News media
warned of doomsday scenarios; officials in Washington publicly fretted
about a \"cyber-Pearl Harbor\" that would take lives and destroy
critical infrastructure. [The most dire predictions, however, did not
come to pass.]{.underline} The United States has not been struck by
devastating cyberattacks with physical effects; it seems that even if
U.S. adversaries wanted to carry out such assaults, traditional forms of
deterrence would prevent them from acting.

Behind those mistaken warnings lay an assumption that the only
alternative to cyberpeace must be cyberwar. But in the years since, it
has become clear that like all realms of conflict, [the domain of
cyberspace is shaped not by a binary between war and peace but by a
spectrum between those two poles\--and most cyberattacks fall somewhere
in that murky space. The obvious upside of this outcome is that the
worst fears of death and destruction have not been realized. There is a
downside, however: the complex nature of cyberconflict has made it more
difficult for the United States to craft an effective cyberstrategy. And
even if lives have not been lost and infrastructure has mostly been
spared, it is hardly the case that cyberattacks have been harmless. U.S.
adversaries have honed their cyberskills to inflict damage on U.S.
**national security**, the American **economy**, and, most worrisome of
all, **American democracy**]{.underline}. Meanwhile, **[Washington has
struggled to move past its initial perception of the
problem]{.underline}**, [clinging to outmoded ideas that have limited
its responses. The United States has also demonstrated an unwillingness
to consistently confront its adversaries in the cyber-realm and has
suffered from serious self-inflicted wounds that have left it in a poor
position to advance its national interests in cyberspace.]{.underline}

[To do better, the United States **must focus on the most pernicious
threats** of all: cyberattacks aimed at weakening societal trust, the
underpinnings of democracy, and the functioning of a globalized
economy.]{.underline} The Biden administration seems to recognize the
need for a new approach. But to make significant progress, [**it will
need to reform the country\'s cyberstrategy**, starting with its most
fundamental aspect: the way Washington understands the
problem.]{.underline}

SHOTS FIRED

The first known cyberattack occurred in 1988, when Robert Morris, a
graduate student in computer science, released a small piece of
software\--eventually dubbed \"the Morris worm\"\--that created outages
across the still nascent Internet. During the two decades that followed,
cybersecurity remained the concern mostly of geeky hackers and shadowy
intelligence operatives. That all changed in 2010 with the Stuxnet
operation, a devastatingly effective cyberattack on centrifuges that
Iran used to enrich uranium. U.S. leaders soon began sounding the alarm
about their own country\'s vulnerability. As early as 2009, President
Barack Obama had warned of cyberattacks that could plunge \"entire
cities into darkness.\" Three years later, while briefing the Senate
Armed Services Committee, Keith Alexander, the director of the National
Security Agency (NSA), said it was only a matter of time before
cyberattacks destroyed critical infrastructure. Around the same time,
Senator Jay Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia, claimed that \"the
prospect of mass casualties\" made cyberattacks \"as dangerous as
terrorism.\"

These warnings seemed prescient when, in 2012, Iranian operatives
targeted the oil company Saudi Aramco with malware, wiping out data on
30,000 computers. Two weeks later, Iran targeted the Qatari company
RasGas, one of the largest natural gas producers in the world, in a
similar strike. These cyberattacks were by far the most destructive in
history and marked the first time a government had employed an offensive
operation in cyberspace against a U.S. partner. The strikes rattled
world energy markets. To signal support for the Saudis, Washington
deployed a team of Pentagon cybersecurity experts to Riyadh.

Two months after the Iranian attacks, U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon
Panetta gave a high-profile speech in which he warned of other countries
or terrorists using cyberweapons to derail passenger trains or freight
trains loaded with lethal chemicals, contaminate water supplies in major
cities, shut down the power grid, or disable communication networks and
military hardware. Americans, Panetta declared, needed to prepare for a
kind of \"cyber-Pearl Harbor: an attack that would cause physical
destruction and the loss of life \[and would\] paralyze and shock the
nation and create a new, profound sense of vulnerability.\" Panetta also
attempted to outline the U.S. strategy for deterrence in cyberspace,
arguing that \"improved defenses alone\" would prove insufficient. When
the U.S. national security services detected an imminent cyberattack of
significant consequences, he said, they would need \"the option to take
action.\" And so, he explained, the military had developed \"the
capability to conduct effective \[offensive cyber-\]operations to
counter threats to \[U.S.\] national interests in cyberspace.\"

From 2012 to 2014, the National Security Council staff held dozens of
senior-level meetings to draft a complicated set of policies\--known as
Presidential Policy Directive 20\--that established guidelines for when
the United States could launch offensive cyber-operations to deter
future attacks. At the Pentagon, the Joint Staff devoted several
straight months to developing strict protocols for when the secretary of
defense could approve an \"emergency cyber action\"\--a targeted
cyberattack to neutralize and counter an adversarial attack on the
homeland.

That planning was put to the test in 2014, when North Korean operatives
conducted the first-ever destructive cyberattack on U.S. soil,
exfiltrating heaps of confidential information from servers belonging to
Sony Pictures, which was planning to release a film that mocked the
North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. The hackers spread the information,
including embarrassing emails, throughout the Internet; knocked out
Sony\'s digital networks; and threatened to carry out further
\"terrorist attacks\" in cyberspace. For weeks, the U.S. intelligence
community feared that North Korean operatives had prepositioned
cybermunitions inside American critical infrastructure and would soon
detonate them.

That did not happen, and in many ways, the Obama administration\'s
response to the attack was sophisticated and effective. The president
directly called out the North Koreans for the hack, and the
administration immediately levied economic sanctions, the first ever
imposed in response to a cyberattack. The combination of public
attribution and sanctions seemed to deter Pyongyang from conducting
additional attacks. [But the most important takeaway was that even after
two years of planning and development, the U.S. military **did not have
the cyber-response capabilities Panetta had promised.**]{.underline}

[LESSONS NOT LEARNED]{.underline}

Part of the problem was that [the Obama administration took an
old-school approach to cyberspace that was stuck, in some ways, **in an
archaic, Cold War-style paradigm** according to which cyber-operations
could quickly escalate into a full-blown war. This perspective carried
over into the Pentagon\'s decisions when it came to building a force
structure for the cyber-domain:]{.underline} in 2009, Secretary of
Defense Robert Gates established U.S. Cyber Command, which is
subordinate to the four-star commander of U.S. Strategic Command, the
notoriously slow-moving organization that oversees the country\'s
nuclear weapons. This structure suggested that [the administration saw
conflict in the cyber-domain as analogous to nuclear conflict or
military activities in outer space, rather than as a dynamic sphere of
operations more akin to counterterrorism or the world of special forces.
Gates also determined that the new command would not carry out so-called
information operations designed to influence the perceptions, thoughts,
or beliefs of foreign actors in ways that would serve U.S.
strategy.]{.underline}

**[These decisions delighted Washington\'s Russian
adversaries]{.underline}**. During a 2013 meeting between senior U.S.
defense officials and their Russian counterparts, a high-ranking officer
in th[e Russian military, General Nikolai Makarov, taunted the
Americans.]{.underline} \"One uses information to destroy nations, not
networks,\" he said. \"That\'s why we\'re happy that you Americans are
so stupid as to build an entire Cyber Command that doesn\'t have a
mission of information warfare!\" At the time, defense leaders didn\'t
consider that the United States might be one of the nations that Makarov
had in mind. [After Russian interference in the U.S. presidential
election three years later, his remarks took on an even more sinister
cast.]{.underline}

[Cyber Command\'s structure and mission had serious consequences in the
years that followed, especially in the U.S. campaign against the Islamic
State (also known as ISIS).]{.underline} The Pentagon had structured the
new organization and designed its capabilities based on existing war
plans that focused on rival countries; as a result, Cyber Command had
very few resources dedicated to counterterrorism. During the first two
years of the conflict, [poor leadership at the top, a lack of
operational capability, and an unwillingness to risk intelligence
sources and methods resulted in Cyber Command\'s failure to disrupt ISIS
operations]{.underline}. In 2015, this debacle led a top military
commander of the U.S. effort against ISIS to declare, \"I only wish that
Cyber Command could inflict as much pain on ISIS as DISA does on me!\"
(DISA, the Defense Information Systems Agency, provides tech support to
the U.S. military.)

[Beneath these flawed decisions on organization and mission lay a deeper
failure to learn the lessons of the 2014 North Korean hack of Sony:
**cyberattacks require an immediate response, public attribution, and
diplomatic confrontation**. In the wake of that attack, China and Russia
each carried out an increasingly bold and insidious wave of
cyberattacks. In the spring of 2014, for example, a group of operatives
linked to the Kremlin attempted to derail the Ukrainian presidential
election with a potent combination of hacking, disinformation, and
denial-ofservice attacks. Ukrainian cybersecurity experts narrowly
prevented the assault from succeeding. But the White House was unwilling
to confront Russia or provide Ukraine with any type of support in the
cyber-domain.]{.underline}

Then, in December 2015, [Russianbacked operatives attacked Ukraine\'s
electric grid, leaving parts of the country without power for days in
the midst of winter weather. Once again, the Obama administration stood
by without responding.]{.underline} [This likely **contributed to
Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s calculus** that he could **conduct
cyberand information operations to interfere with the U.S. presidential
election** in 2016 without fear of reprisal]{.underline}. **[He was
right]{.underline}**: t[he Obama administration **did little to push
back against Russian meddling** during the summer and fall of
2016\--until it became a crisis and hit the front page of The New York
Times.]{.underline}

[The Obama White House proved similarly **unwilling to confront China**
over its transgressions in cyberspace.]{.underline} This was of a piece
with the administration\'s emphasis on building stable economic
relations with Beijing, which also overrode concerns about Chinese human
rights abuses and China\'s aggressive military moves in the South China
Sea. [Even before North Korea\'s Sony attack, China had taken advantage
of this passivity to steal American intellectual property on a massive
scale between 2008 and 2013, to the tune of between \$200 billion and
\$600 billion of value per year.]{.underline} The strategic impact of
this theft is difficult to prove empirically, but it almost certainly
gave a huge lift to Beijing\'s Made in China 2025 initiative, which
seeks to advance China\'s domestic production of artificial intelligence
systems, telecommunications, clean energy technology, aerospace
products, and biotechnology.

Later, in 2014 and 2015, [Chinese intelligence operatives penetrated
networks belonging to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and
exfiltrated the personnel files of around two million former or retired
federal employees and more than two million current ones]{.underline},
including information on nearly all the background investigations of
Americans who held security clearances at the top-secret level. Prodded
by intense congressional pressure and media scrutiny, Obama confronted
Chinese President Xi Jinping during a September 2015 meeting at the
White House. Obama offered to not publicly attribute the OPM hack to
China, and in exchange, Xi agreed to stop intelligence operations
against U.S. firms and to establish a diplomatic working group to
discuss issues related to cyberspace. Immediately following the summit,
the volume of Chinese intellectual property theft plummeted, and Beijing
and Washington held a round of talks about cybertheft. This positive
outcome clearly demonstrated the importance of challenging China\--but
it also served as a reminder that **[the administration had waited far
too long to take action.]{.underline}**

U[.S. President Donald Trump took office in 2017 with a more assertive,
combative tone]{.underline} than that of his predecessor. His
administration\'s approach to U.S. rivals was inconsistent and
unpredictable, but in 2018, the White House approved the elevation of
Cyber Command to full combatant command status, which freed the
organization from the constraints of working through U.S. Strategic
Command. Later that year, [National Security Adviser John Bolton
announced that the administration would take a more aggressive approach
to offensive cyberoperations by permitting the military, with the
approval of the secretary of defense, to **conduct operations below the
legal threshold of an \"armed attack.\"**]{.underline} This policy,
known as National Security Presidential Memorandum 13, set the
foundation for cyber-operations, such as denial-of-service attacks and
information operations, targeting the Internet Research Agency, a
Russian \"troll farm,\" and may have prevented the group from
interfering in the 2018 congressional midterm elections. **[These moves
demonstrated the effectiveness of low-level, proactive
cyber-tactics]{.underline}** [and drove home the idea that when it comes
to cyberspace, **deterrence need not take place on the level of grand
strategy:** low-tech, low-risk, targeted operations can do the
trick.]{.underline}

The Trump administration\'s approach to Russia\'s cyber-campaigns was by
no means an unqualified success, however, owing to the behavior of the
president himself. Trump\'s bizarre genuflection toward Putin undermined
any coherent strategy against Russia, and Trump\'s unwillingness to
stand up for U.S. interests vis-a-vis Russia posed a genuine threat to
American democracy. From his public invitation to the Russians to hack
his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, to his endorsement of Putin\'s
nonsensical proposal to create a joint U.S.-Russian \"impenetrable
cybersecurity unit,\" Trump repeatedly undermined the efforts of his own
country\'s law enforcement agencies, intelligence organizations, and
military to protect U.S. national security.

OWN GOALS

But Tr[ump is hardly the only American who has damaged U.S.
cybersecurity in recent years.]{.underline} In 2013, an NSA contractor,
Edward [Snowden]{.underline}, perpetrated one of the most significant
leaks in U.S. history when he provided journalists\--and, according to
some accounts, Chinese and Russian intelligence services\--with
thousands of highly classified documents revealing the expansive reach
of the NSA\'s global operations, including its eavesdropping on senior
government officials of countries allied with the United States. It is
difficult to overstate the negative impact these disclosures had on U.S.
efforts to secure cyberspace. Washington essentially lost all
credibility on the world stage when it came to issues regarding
cyberspace. After learning that the NSA had spied on heads of state,
including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European governments were in
no mood to work with Washington against Chinese or Russian
cyber-operations. \"Trust needs to be rebuilt,\" Merkel said at the
time.

In the wake of the revelations, a wide range of governments\--from U.S.
allies in Europe to China\--labeled Washington as the greatest threat to
cybersecurity in the world. The fallout from Snowden\'s leaks also dealt
a devastating blow to the cooperation between the U.S. government and
the private sector, an essential aspect of defending U.S. interests in
cyberspace. Owing to a fear of bad publicity and the risk of losing
business in China, U.S. technology companies that had previously
collaborated on unclassified cybersecurity initiatives with the federal
government decided to completely halt such cooperation.

[Things got worse a few years later when the NSA lost control of some of
its most sensitive hacking tools]{.underline}. In two separate
incidents, [employees of an NSA unit]{.underline} that was then known as
the Office of Tailored Access Operations\--an outfit that conducts the
agency\'s most sensitive cybersurveillance operations\--[removed
extremely powerful tools from top-secret NSA networks and, incredibly,
took them home. Eventually, the Shadow Brokers\--a mysterious hacking
group with ties to Russian intelligence services\--got their hands on
some of the NSA tools and released them on the Internet]{.underline}. As
one former TAO employee told The Washington Post, these were \"the keys
to the kingdom\"\--digital tools that would \"undermine the security of
a lot of major government and corporate networks both here and abroad.\"

[One such tool, known as \"Eternal-Blue,\" **got into the wrong hands**
and has been used to **unleash a scourge of ransomware attacks**\--in
which hackers paralyze computer systems until their demands are
met\--that will plague the world for years to come]{.underline}. [Two of
the **most destructive cyberattacks in history** made use of tools that
were based on EternalBlue:]{.underline} the so-called [WannaCry attack,
launched by North Korea in 2017, which caused major disruptions at the
British National Health Service for at least a week, and the NotPetya
attack, carried out that same year by Russianbacked operatives, which
resulted in more than \$10 billion in damage to the global economy and
caused weeks of delays at the world\'s largest shipping company, Maersk.
In the past few years, ransomware attacks have struck **hospitals,
schools, city governments, and pipelines, driving home the severe nature
of the cyberthreat**.]{.underline}

HOW TO DO BETTER

Washington\'s decade spent in thrall to an outmoded conception of
cyberconflict, the Obama administration\'s excessive passivity, the
Trump administration\'s inconsistency, and the damage caused by leaks
and sloppiness meant that when U.S. President Joe Biden took office
earlier this year, he inherited a mess. [Getting U.S. policy back on
track will require his administration to substantially change the way
that Washington conceives of and carries out cybersecurity. That will be
particularly challenging given the current security environment, which
is being shaped by China\'s rollout of the \"digital yuan,\" the
meteoric rise in the value and impact of cryptocurrencies, **the
flourishing of disinformation**, and **the sharp increase in ransomware
attacks**.]{.underline} Meanwhile, as nuclear negotiations with Iran
intensify, [the regime in Tehran will likely experiment with new cyber-
and information operations to gain leverage at the negotiating table,
and **China and Russia will almost certainly test** the relatively new
administration **with cyberattacks within the next year.**]{.underline}

In this climate, the most important thing the Biden administration can
do is embrace the notion that countries that can conduct destructive
cyberattacks are not likely to be deterred by Washington\'s own
cyber-capabilities but can still be deterred by the United States\'
conventional military power and economic might. When it comes to
cyberspace, Washington shouldn\'t try to fight fire with fire\--or at
least not with fire alone. The United States, after all, has many more
effective ways to contain and extinguish the flames.

With that in mind, [the first practical step the administration should
take is to prioritize the defense of data.]{.underline} Working with
Congress, [Biden must redouble efforts to pass a national data security
law that will provide citizens with the right to take legal action
against companies that fail to protect their data, similar to the
European Union\'s General Data Protection Regulation.]{.underline} The
United States is one of the only major democracies in the world that
does not have such a law. As a result, an extraordinarily complex
patchwork of state-level privacy and data security laws have sprung up,
inhibiting the development of a secure informationbased economy. The
current effort on Capitol Hill to require companies that provide
critical infrastructure\--including those in the manufacturing, energy
production, and financial services sectors\--to notify federal
authorities of data breaches represents a promising development. But it
is not nearly enough.

**[The administration should also make the rapid public attribution of
cyberattacks a core component of its strategy]{.underline}**, [even in
politically complex situations.]{.underline} The conventional wisdom
used to hold that it was difficult to attribute cyberattacks with a high
level of confidence. But over the past five years, [advanced digital
forensics have allowed intelligence agencies and private-sector
cybersecurity firms to conclude with reasonable certainty who is behind
most cyberattacks. That evolution is important: attribution alone has
proved to be an effective, if short-lived, way to deter U.S. rivals from
carrying out attacks.]{.underline}

[Better U.S. policy will also require some organizational
shifts]{.underline}. For starters, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency established in 2018 within the Department of Homeland
Security must become the true center of gravity for domestic
cybersecurity operations; the final authority over such operations
should not be granted to intelligence organizations, law enforcement
agencies, or the military. In the past three years, CISA has developed
important capabilities to combat election interference and
disinformation campaigns. Now, it must improve its defense of federal
government networks, speed the sharing of threat indicators with the
private sector, and offer expertise and operational support to the
providers of critical infrastructure that face threats from ransomware.
**[To do all that, CISA will need more funding]{.underline}**: [the
organization\'s current annual budget of \$3 billion should be tripled
over the next four years, and it should eventually equal that of the
NSA.]{.underline}

[Law enforcement still has an important role to play,]{.underline}
particularly when it comes to domestic defensive cyberoperations to
thwart ransomware attacks. The FBI recently undertook an effective and
creative effort to remove malicious tools implanted by Chinese
intelligence services in hundreds of servers across the United States.
In a novel and precedentsetting step, the bureau obtained warrants to
unilaterally identify and delete the Chinese malware without the consent
of the equipment\'s owners. The legal authority for that operation was
established by an update to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; the
administration should seek additional innovative updates to laws that
will allow the FBI to take more proactive measures.

[**The U.S. military must also continue to adapt to the cyber-era**.
Biden should shape Cyber Command into something more akin to today\'s
nimble, flexible Joint Special Operations Command and less like the
lumbering Strategic Air Command of the 1950s.]{.underline} [Cyber
Command has relied too much on the NSA to create unique, nonattributable
cybertools, which can take years to develop; to increase its agility,
Cyber Command should turn to less complex, \"burnable\" tools, that is,
ones that are expendable because they are already publicly available,
which means there is no need to conceal their origin]{.underline}. The
[Trump]{.underline} administration, to its credit, [upped Washington\'s
game by increasing the frequency of low-tech, publicly attributable
offensive cyberoperations. This had the effect of **bolstering U.S.
credibility in the cyber-realm**]{.underline}\--even in the face of
Trump\'s erratic personal conduct. For example, after Iran\'s elite
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps shot down a U.S. surveillance drone in
2019, Cyber Command conducted a retaliatory attack on a database crucial
to the group. The strike demonstrated Washington\'s ability to achieve
strategic goals while avoiding escalatory tactics. New legislation and
new approaches would go a long way toward fixing Washington\'s flawed
cyberstrategy But the government cannot improve U.S. cybersecurity on
its own: it must meaningfully engage with the private sector to build
cyberdefenses and cyberdeterrence. Companies are in the cross hairs of
hackers of many stripes, and corporate leaders have become de facto
national security decision-makers. To create shared norms and encourage
the independent enforcement of cyberprotection standards, at least by
publicly traded companies, Congress should consider creating a
cybersecurity analog to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which
protects the integrity of markets, and a version for cyberspace of the
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which shape the public
disclosures that companies must make.

[Even if Washington does everything right, it **will still need global
cooperation**. Luckily, the geopolitical environment today is conducive
to strong U.S. diplomatic leadership on issues regarding
cyberspace.]{.underline} Washington has mostly recovered from the
fallout of the Snowden and the NSA leaks, and [**the world has finally
recognized that the Chinese and Russian models of Internet autocracy are
antithetical to a liberal order and a globalized economy**. Washington
needs to take advantage of this state of affairs through **intensive
cooperation** with like-minded countries, such as **France, Germany**,
Japan, South Korea, and the **United Kingdom.**]{.underline}

[The UN is not the place to do so]{.underline}, however: in that forum,
China and Russia can advance their interests by entangling Washington
and its partners in abstract debates about norms even as they wantonly
violate those norms in the real world. Many strategists have suggested
that NATO could serve as the center of gravity for cooperation in
cyberspace between the United States and its allies and partners, but
the organization was built for the Cold War and is too clunky to foster
creative strategies. Instead, Washington should pursue a series of
bilateral agreements to prevent the spread of black-market ransomware
tools. One model might be the Proliferation Security Initiative, a
multilateral effort inaugurated by the George W Bush administration to
improve the interdiction of weapons of mass destruction.

[If American policymakers have learned anything in the past decade, it
is that cyberconflict is a murky business, one that resists
black-and-white notions about war and peace. That lack of clarity in the
**battle space makes it all the more important for Washington to be
clear about its goals and strategies**]{.underline}. The cyber-realm
will always be messy. But U.S. cyber-policy does not have to be.

### AT: Security Ks

#### Securitizing cyber threats is good. Our method [secures vulnerabilities]{.underline} while [preventing militarism]{.underline}.

**Pickin ND** (Matthew, King\'s College London, War Studies, Graduate
Student in international relations and politics. "What is the
securitization of cyberspace? Is it a problem?" Academia,
<https://www.academia.edu/3100313/What_is_the_securitization_of_cyberspace_Is_it_a_problem>,
AK) \*A note on the date: I can't find it, but the article must be
published after or during 2012 because it cites articles from then.

The 2010 National Intelligence Annual Threat Assessment stated that
**[the United States was under a severe threat of
cyber-attacks]{.underline}** (Blair, 2010). [Due to the amount of
infrastructure connected to the internet in the United States targets
for cyber-attacks are nearly unlimited, as a superpower the United
States presents a valuable target. "As the world's hegemonic power, the
United States is also the main target state that dissident groups,
terrorists, and rogue states wish to damage]{.underline} (Valeriano &
Maness, 2011, p. 145)." Therefore, [the United States **must have some
defence, or offensive capability** in order **to protect itself** from
future conflicts and attacks on critical infrastructure.]{.underline} In
Foreign Affairs William J Lynn the former deputy secretary of defence
wrote that [the centrality of information technology in the United
States **makes it a prime target**.]{.underline} He argued that
[extending advanced cyber-defences was crucial for the American economy,
and also stated that failure of critical infrastructure would compromise
national defence, "Our assessment is that cyber-attacks will be a
significant component of future conflicts]{.underline} (Lynn, 2011)."
Therefore in order [to protect the United States, the government has
been forced to **securitize the issue**]{.underline}. According to
William J Lynn [an attack could compromise national defence; therefore
the issue is very high in the national security agenda]{.underline}. In
the article, he also addresses the critics who argue that cyberspace is
at risk of being militarized and states that US cyber strategy has been
designed to prevent this from happening, ["**Far from militarizing
cyberspace**, U.S. cyber-strategy will **make it more difficult for
military actors** to use cyberspace for hostile purposes]{.underline}
(Lynn, 2011)." [In securitizing cyberspace and creating advanced
cyber-defences and cyber-weapons the United States is preparing for any
future conflict or attack. If such an attack or conflict is a real
existing threat then **it is beneficial to prepare through
securitization**, otherwise the disadvantages clearly outweigh any
advantage.]{.underline}

[The other main benefit of securitizing cyberspace would be tackling
cyber-crime]{.underline}. According to the security company Sophos, in
the first six months of 2010 it received **[60,000 new malware samples
every day.]{.underline}** Apart from malware, [cyber-crime covers many
different areas such as financial, piracy, hacking and cyber-terrorism.
These crimes are growing due to the constantly evolving communications
system of social sharing of data, online data storage and social
networking,]{.underline} "Although cybercrime has formed a hidden shadow
and a kind of evil doppelganger to every step of the Internet's long
history from its very origins, [its growth has suddenly become explosive
in recent years by virtually any estimate]{.underline} (Deibert &
Rohozinski, Contesting Cyberspace and the Coming Crisis of Authority,
2012, p. 28)." Both Deibert and Rohozinski argue that [the rise is
cyber-crime has become a big problem for states, in 2011 counterfeiting
and copying cost the Asia-Pacific region almost \$21
billion.]{.underline} Certainly cyber-space has become a rewarding way
to commit crimes with little risk of prosecution, "Cybercrime has
elicited so little prosecution from the world's law enforcement agencies
it makes one wonder a de facto decriminalization has occurred (Deibert &
Rohozinski, Contesting Cyberspace and the Coming Crisis of Authority,
2012, p. 29)." Due to the trouble of cyber-crime, [**the only way of
combating it effectively would be greater state regulation and
intervention**. With the whole of cyber-space effectively securitized by
the United States due to the threat to national security by
technological and social shifts, the government is asserting itself
increasingly to counter these threats.]{.underline}

#### Autonomous drones are inevitable. Technology is developed and can be used any time!

Reading through the research on autonomous drones, [one gets the sense
that these are the inevitable successors of existing
drones]{.underline}. For example, Ronald Arkin says: '[The [trend is
clear:]{.mark} Warfare will continue and [autonomous robots will]{.mark}
ultimately [be deployed]{.mark} in its conduct.' 2]{.underline} To some
extent, [weapon [autonomy is inevitable]{.mark} and already being
realized]{.underline}. [Many [weapons]{.mark} and vehicles are
[automated to a large degree]{.mark}]{.underline} and are even able to
select and attack targets without any human intervention. Close-in
Weapon Systems (CIWS), like the Phalanx, Centurion, and AK-630, are
prime examples of this. These are [designed to attack aircraft or
incoming missiles and are often capable of being controlled by a human
operator or allowed to act independently based on target acquisition
criteria.]{.underline} CIWS are often described as being 'automatic' or
'automated,' rather than autonomous, though they are autonomous in the
sense that I use the term because they can select and attack targets
without human control. I will distinguish CIWS by calling them
'autonomous weapons' rather than 'autonomous drones.' The latter term is
best reserved for machines that can act more independently than CIWS,
which are typically mounted on ships or in fixed defensive positions.

[Some [semi-autonomous drones]{.mark} that are currently [in the late
stages of development could be]{.mark} made [fully autonomous]{.mark}
[or]{.mark} at least [provide the foundation]{.mark} for building
autonomous drones.]{.underline} The BAE Taranis drone is projected to be
a semi-autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), though the extent of
its independence is secret. [Recent reports suggest that the aircraft
will wait for approval from a pilot before fi ring at the targets it
selects, but with the technology advanced to this level, it is [easy to
imagine]{.mark} a Taranis or a [successor attacking]{.mark}
[without]{.mark} prior [authorization]{.mark}]{.underline}. The US
Navy's X-47B is likewise capable of operating without any human control.
Its ability to successfully take off from and land on aircraft carriers
without human assistance is evidence that the drone could also be used
to conduct attacks. Thus, [there is [little doubt that the
tech]{.mark}nology needed [to create]{.mark} [autonomous drones
exists]{.mark} and that armed forces could deploy these machines in
future conflicts.]{.underline}

[[There is]{.mark} clearly [a rush to develop]{.mark} weapons [platforms
that have]{.mark} greater [independence]{.mark}, and it does [seem
likely that future wars]{.mark} will [involve]{.mark} many different
types of [machines]{.mark} [that will be able to]{.mark} move around
battlefi elds and [attack without human control]{.mark}]{.underline}.
However, exactly what these machines will be like remains highly
speculative. A persistent problem when talking about autonomous weapons
is that the term 'autonomous' is contested. Although many commentators
use this term, they tend to employ it in so many different ways that
they often end up talking past each other. As I have defi ned them,
[autonomous drones are machines that can attack targets without being
directly controlled by a human operator]{.underline}. Independent
targeting marks a decisive shift in the character of drones by raising
the possibility that they, rather than humans, could make decisions
about matters of life and death on the battlefi eld. Yet it is essential
to recognize that even when machines have the power to kill, they may be
under human control to varying degrees. [[A drone could be
autonomous]{.mark} and yet [still be heavily restricted in]{.mark} terms
of [how]{.mark} this autonomy is [expressed.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Inevitable---2NC

#### Drones arms races are inevitable, preventing civilian causalities at war

**Shulzke 17** -- *Lecturer in International Relations at the University
of York, UK, PhD in Political Science from the University at Albany,
State University of New York, US, in 2013 with a dissertation on how
soldiers make ethical decisions during counterinsurgency operations.*

Drones are apt to create a security dilemma for states and non-state
actors alike. This is 'a situation in which each party's efforts to
increase its own security reduce the security of others.' 37 Because
most available drones are offensive weapons platforms that derive their
capacities for risk management from their ability to launch attacks away
from the areas where drone operators are based, they are particularly
likely to prompt rivals to develop their own offensive drone capacities
to counter any unmanned threat they may face. The USA is largely
responsible for initiating this security dilemma and has been
justifiably criticized for doing this without taking adequate steps to
impose restrictions on drone operations. 38 However[, now that multiple
states and non-state actors are involved in developing drones, the
[groundwork for]{.mark} a [multilat]{.mark}eral [drone]{.mark} arms
[race is]{.mark} firmly [in place]{.mark}]{.underline}. [States and
non-state [actors now have]{.mark} strong [incentives to develop drones
faster than]{.mark} their [rivals]{.mark} and equally strong
[disincentives against]{.mark} unilaterally [attempting to limit]{.mark}
drone [production.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[A]{.mark} drone arms [race is]{.mark} arguably already [in progress,
with]{.mark} many states and non-state [actors making greater
use]{.mark} of drones [while]{.mark} also [attempting to improve]{.mark}
their [capacities]{.mark} for building and maintaining drones
[domestically.]{.mark}]{.underline} We can see [[European]{.mark} states
beginning to create their own drones, [China]{.mark} unveiling drones
that are closely modeled on American UAVs]{.underline}, 39 and [[Russian
drones]{.mark} operating [in Syria]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} 40 as
well as US forces developing weapons that can destroy enemy drones. 41
Security dilemmas are usually a cause for concern as they may produce
conflicts as a by-product of cycles of competition and escalation.
Butterfield argues that 'the greatest war in history could be produced
without the intervention of any great criminals who might be out to do
deliberate harm to the world' simply because their efforts to provide
for their own security may lead them into conflict. 42 If competition is
carried out primarily, or even partly, through the development of
drones, then one may wonder whether the pursuit of technological
advantages in war could provoke dangerous escalations or even cause
wars.

Fears of arms races increasing the likelihood of conflict and
intensifying wars are well-founded because many arms races are driven by
an urge to create more powerful weapons. Arms races that result in the
introduction of more destructive and expensive weapons that are less
suited for being used in accordance with just war restrictions are
objectionable. The race to develop bigger and more powerful nuclear
devices during the Cold War is a prime example of the negative
repercussions this type of competition can have. It increased American
and Soviet capacities for using force in immoral ways and caused
repeated conflicts that risked escalation into an immensely destructive
war.

I argue that [drones are causing a much different kind of arms
race.]{.underline} Thus far[, [the rush to develop]{.mark} drones [has
resulted in]{.mark} a [proliferation]{.mark} of machines [that are
designed for]{.mark} reconnaissance and [precise strikes against]{.mark}
military [targets]{.mark}---]{.underline}machines that allow
belligerents to wage wars using more restricted levels of force and show
heightened respect for non-combatant immunity. Moreover, [the [leading
contenders]{.mark} in this race are armed forces that [already
have]{.mark} immensely powerful weapons, including [nuclear weapons and
other]{.mark} weapons of mass destruction ([WMDs)]{.mark}.]{.underline}
By arming themselves with drones, [these belligerents are [not
increasing]{.mark} their existing [capacities for immense destruction
but]{.mark} rather [developing the means of]{.mark} [engaging in]{.mark}
more [limited and targeted acts of violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
kind of arms race [marks an encouraging improvement in weapons
innovation as older and more destructive weapons are increasingly
marginalized]{.underline} by the competition to introduce more precise
weapons. 'For the fi rst time, we are [[directing]{.mark} our defense
laboratory wizardry [along the azimuth of
self]{.mark}-[restraint]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}' 43

Belligerents that do not wish to comply with the principle of
noncombatant immunity may choose to develop drones for attacks on
civilians[[. Drones could be]{.mark} fairly effective [instruments of
civilian]{.mark} [victimization,]{.mark} [but t]{.mark}he [incentives
for using them]{.mark} in this way are [not]{.mark} very
[strong]{.mark}. There are already countless varieties of ranged or
indirect weapons, such as rockets, artillery, IEDs, and
landmines]{.underline} that can be used to carry out cheap and
terrifying indiscriminate attacks. These [[organizations]{.mark} hardly
need drones to harm civilians and are [apt to prefer powerful]{.mark}
[weapons]{.mark} that are better suited for mass casualty
attacks.]{.underline}

[One could argue that the character of the drone arms race could change
and lead to the [creation of weapons]{.mark} that are [less capable
of]{.mark} being [operated in accordance with]{.mark} moral and legal
[restrictions]{.mark}]{.underline}, yet [this does [not]{.mark} appear
[likely]{.mark}]{.underline} for two reasons. [First, part of the
[impetus]{.mark} for developing more powerful weapons in the past was
[due to]{.mark} the weapons' [inaccuracies]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
[[Soviet Union developed]{.mark} far more powerful nuclear
[warheads]{.mark}]{.underline} than the USA and had a nuclear strike
doctrine that was more heavily based on [attacking civilian populations
('[countervalue targeting']{.mark} in the language of nuclear
strategy]{.underline}). 44 This was partly due to the Soviet's poorer
targeting systems, which were unable to accurately hit American nuclear
facilities and had to compensate for that weakness by delivering more
destructive warheads. By contrast, [the [USA]{.mark} [had more
accurate]{.mark} targeting [systems]{.mark} and correspondingly tended
[to favor]{.mark} strikes against enemy military targets
('[counterthreat targeting']{.mark}). [Drones]{.mark} make it possible
to identify and attack targets with greater accuracy than ever before,
thereby [obviating]{.mark} the [need for 'countervalue']{.mark}
strikes]{.underline} or for overpowered WMDs.

There is a chance that the current trends in drone innovation will not
persist and [that drones will one day become more destructive and
[indiscriminate weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, despite indications to the
contrary. It would be naïve to suggest that this is an impossible
outcome, especially given the challenges inherent in predicting the
unintended consequences of technological development. Nevertheless,
[this **[risk is outweighed]{.mark}** [by t]{.mark}he [potential for
drones to mitigate wars' destructiveness]{.mark} and can be managed
politically]{.underline}. In recent decades, [states have made
unprecedented efforts to reduce stockpiles of, and prevent violence
using, a broad range of morally questionable weapons, including nuclear
weapons, landmines, weapons platforms in space, and chemical
weapons]{.underline}. 45 As I will discuss in Chapters 7and 8 , efforts
to regulate war and the use of particular weapons can also help to
ensure that drone development continues on its current trajectory.

### Ethics---1NC

#### Critical scholarship overblows drone accidents and underestimates conventional warfare's faults---autonomous weapons are [net most ethical]{.underline}.

**Shulzke 17** -- *Lecturer in International Relations at the University
of York, UK, PhD in Political Science from the University at Albany,
State University of New York, US, in 2013 with a dissertation on how
soldiers make ethical decisions during counterinsurgency operations.*

As I have argued[, it [seems unlikely]{.mark} that armed [forces]{.mark}
would pr[oduce autonomous drones that]{.mark} deliberately [contravene
ROE,]{.mark} or even ones that would have the freedom to develop their
own desires and values]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [one could argue that
this level of autonomy is not necessary to make these machines morally
dubious]{.underline} because technical malfunctions could lead any
drone, even one with fairly limited freedom, to use unjustifi able
violence. Garcia warns against a future in which autonomous drones
resemble machines from The Terminator movies, turning against humans to
create an unprecedented new security risk---and while he acknowledges
that it is unlikely for drones to wage a war against humanity, he
maintains that there is a high risk that they may be hacked or may
malfunction. '\[T\]he risk of malfunctions from failed software or
cyberattacks could result in new dangers altogether. Countries will have
dissimilar computer programs that, when interacting with each other, may
be erratic. Further, signal jamming and hacking become all the more
attractive -- and more dangerous -- as armies increasingly rely on
drones and other robotic weaponry.'

Malfunctions are certain to occur when autonomous weapons and drones are
employed. The Phalanx CIWS has been involved in several instances of
mistaken attacks and infl icted 'collateral damage' on friendly forces.
During one training mission in 1989, a Phalanx not only destroyed a
practice drone, but also sent rounds into a nearby American ship,
killing one person and injuring another. 10 A similar incident occurred
during the First Gulf War when four rounds fi red from a Phalanx mounted
on the USS Jarrett struck the USS Missouri, though this attack did not
cause any casualties.

This comes back to one of the concerns that was raised in Chapter 3
---the possibility that drones could have technical faults that would
lead them to malfunction or make them susceptible to hacking. A[lthough
it is reasonable to be concerned that weapons could malfunction and it
is certainly vital for armed forces to avoid deploying drones that have
not been adequately tested, it is also [unfair to have a zero-tolerance
policy for technical faults]{.mark} or suggest that the possibility of
some malfunctions provides a reason to oppose the use of drones in
general]{.underline}. [[Human soldiers do not malfunction as a
machine]{.mark} [would]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} yet as I have
emphasized, [they do [make mistakes,]{.mark} especially [under the harsh
conditions of war]{.mark}]{.underline} that impair their cognitive
processes.

Holmes estimates that a high [number of military casualties in previous
wars were infl icted accidentally]{.underline}. For example,
[[during]{.mark} the [Vietnam]{.mark} War, around [846]{.mark} soldiers
[died from]{.mark} [negligent discharges]{.mark} of their
weapons]{.underline}, with another 939 killing fellow soldiers in
'accidental homicides.' 11 And these estimates only account for the
military deaths, saying nothing of the hundreds or thousands of
civilians who may have been killed when soldiers accidentally fi red
their weapons or struck civilians with their vehicles. [These casualties
are not due to malfunctions, yet they are analogous as they are
casualties that are unintentionally infl icted outside of
combat.]{.underline}

The 1989 incident of a Phalanx killing one sailor and injuring another
was only one of several training deaths infl icted during that year,
with others including a manned aircraft that accidentally dropped a bomb
onto an American ship and a collision between two jets during an air
show. Between October 11 and November 16 of 1989, 11 people were killed
and 46 injured in US Navy accidents, only two of these from the incident
involving the Phalanx. 12 And the record on CIWS operated by human
controllers indicates that human error is at least as dangerous as
autonomous targeting controls. In 1996 a Phalanx on board a Japanese
ship shot down an American jet during a training mission, but the
accident was caused by a gunnery offi cer who directed it to open fi re.
13 One of the worst disasters was the USS Vincennes' attack on a
passenger aircraft during the Iran--Iraq War, when a surface-to-air
missile fi red by human controllers resulted in the death of 290
civilians. 14 This does not tell us anything about how many accidents we
should expect from autonomous weapons in the future, nor does it
exculpate negligent engineers or military personnel who employ these
weapons without taking adequate precautions. However, it does suggest
that [we should expect some accidents and malfunctions to happen, and
that [we should]{.mark} [judge]{.mark} these [incidents in
context]{.mark}, [rather than condemning autonomous weapons]{.mark}
based on an unrealistic standard of faultless performance]{.underline}.

[The [real test]{.mark} for drones---whether autonomous or
non-autonomous--- [should be whether they increase]{.mark} or decrease
the [extent of accidental violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. It would be
deeply regrettable for a drone to malfunction and attack soldiers and
civilians, but [[if]{.mark} the overall extent of [suffering is reduced
by using the drone]{.mark}, then [there is]{.mark} still [good reason to
prefer it over]{.mark} [human soldiers or manned vehicles]{.mark} that
might be used in its place]{.underline}. [**[Wars cannot be
casualty-free]{.mark}.** Accidents will happen when armies and their
weapons are deployed with the aim of killing]{.underline}. We must
[reject the false assurances that drones will produce risk-free
wars]{.underline}, yet we should [also remain committed to using weapons
that can most effectively minimize the magnitude of wars]{.underline},
and especially civilian suffering, when war is unavoidable. The
[possibility that drones could malfunction highlights the need for
rigorously testing these weapons platforms]{.underline} and of having
mechanisms for punishing those who deploy autonomous drones without
adequately testing them or implementing effective safety protocols. The
[[chance of]{.mark} [malfunctions]{.mark} provides prudential grounds
for being skeptical about armed autonomous drones.]{.underline}
Nevertheless, [it [fails to demonstrate]{.mark} that these [machines are
morally faulty]{.mark} or that it would be immoral to use
them.]{.underline}

The [[challenge that drones]{.mark} face is that their malfunctions
[garner a disproportionate]{.mark} amount of [attention]{.mark} [even if
they infl ict far fewer accidental casualties]{.mark} than human
soldiers or manned vehicles]{.underline}. The [[hundreds of accidental
killings]{.mark} perpetrated by human soldiers [rarely make the
news]{.mark}]{.underline}. As we saw in Chapter 5 , they are so
infrequently discussed that [even some [critics]{.mark} of drones who
specialize [in military ethics research]{.mark} [deny the extent of this
problem]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, malfunctioning drones certainly
would make the news and would attract attention even if an incident is
exceptional. This [bias in reporting makes it essential to make greater
efforts to track the numbers of casualties that are infl icted in
various ways,]{.underline} with an aim to facilitate empirically
grounded judgments about the best way to restrict wars.

### Ethics---2NC

#### Drones are [more]{.underline} neutral and ethical than humans -- fears of collateral damage are overblown

Second, I argue that [most existing [drones,]{.mark} as well as many
types of drones that are in development, are defensible based on their
latent potentials]{.underline}. Most drones [[do not create]{.mark} any
[new opportunities for misconduct]{.mark}]{.underline} beyond those that
are already made possible by existing weapons. Drones [[may be used to
target civilians]{.mark} or carry out disproportionate
attacks.]{.underline} They [may permit belligerents to initiate
aggressive wars]{.underline} or fight without first testing available
peaceful means of conflict resolution. Yet [these [risks]{.mark} are
[not]{.mark} substantially [increased by drones]{.mark}. They are
[existing risks]{.mark} that are [characteristic of a broad range of
weapons]{.mark}, and the plausibility of these risks depends heavily on
the balance of military forces between opposing
belligerents]{.underline}. Many of these [[risks are apt to subside as
drones]{.mark} become more [widespread]{.mark} and [reduce the US
military's current dominance]{.mark}]{.underline} in this form of
warfare. Moreover, [[drones]{.mark} have technological characteristics
that substantially increase the potential for morally justifiable uses
of force]{.underline}, and this potential for [[increasing **compliance
with just war principles**]{.mark} weighs in favor of using
drones]{.underline} under many circumstances.

The most important moral advantage that [drones]{.underline} introduce
is that they [make it [easier to manage]{.mark} the [risks]{.mark} that
military personnel and civilians are exposed to]{.underline}. A
perennial dilemma of war, which became increasingly serious over the
course of the twentieth century, is how armed forces should balance the
risks to their own forces against risks to civilians. [[Efforts to
reduce]{.mark} [risk to soldiers]{.mark} tend to [heighten]{.mark} the
[risk to civilians]{.mark}, while efforts to reduce risk to civilians
tend to heighten the risk to soldiers.]{.underline} [[High-altitude
bombing campaigns]{.mark} can ensure that few soldiers are injured and
killed, but they create serious risks of civilian 'collateral
damage.]{.underline}' Conversely, [[soldiers constrained by strict
ROE]{.mark} are less likely to attack civilians]{.underline} who are
mistaken for enemy combatants and [[more likely to be killed]{.mark} or
injured by non-uniformed combatants.]{.underline} The best way of
resolving the risk dilemma is a central point of contention in the
literature on military ethics and just war theory, and for good
reason---[decisions about the apportionment of risk help to determine
the extent to which belligerents will abide by jus in bello
restrictions.]{.underline}

Drones overcome the risk dilemma by obviating the need to protect
soldiers. [Because [drones]{.mark} are proxies for human combatants,
they [allow]{.mark} their [operators to make decisions without]{.mark}
having to take [their own safety in]{.mark}to [consideration]{.mark}.
This grants drone operators greater opportunities for making
disinterested decisions, [limiting violence against civilians]{.mark},
and using minimal levels of force.]{.underline} It also [[creates
opportunities for increasing]{.mark} the strictness of [ROE]{.mark}
without incurring any of the costs that have traditionally been
associated with efforts to protect civilians]{.underline}, especially
heightened chances of soldiers being killed or injured. [This makes it
possible for armed forces using drones to focus their efforts on
reducing the risk to civilians]{.underline}. Moreover, audiences around
the world may reasonably [expect drone users to show greater respect for
civilian immunity and have stronger grounds for condemning violence
against civilians simply because the drone users have the technical
capacity to increase their compliance with the tenets of just war
theory.]{.underline}

The most significant [[decisions about]{.mark} the management of [risk
are made at]{.mark} strategic and [operational levels,]{.mark} with
[soldiers at lower levels]{.mark} of the chain of command being [left
to]{.mark} [act within the]{.mark} confines of [rules]{.mark} that their
[superiors]{.mark} have [establish]{.mark}ed]{.underline}. However, even
at the lowest levels of the military hierarchy, [soldiers have some
freedom to make decisions about the use of force that could expose them,
their fellow soldiers, enemies, or civilians to the risk of being killed
or injured. All [soldiers have a right to self-defense]{.mark} that
authorizes them to take reasonable steps to protect
themselves]{.underline} from real or potential threats, which is
typically acknowledged in soldiers' ROE or their accompanying
provisions. 37 Soldiers must have this right since denying it would
constitute a serious injustice against these people, who are continually
exposed to life-threatening conditions and who must be authorized to
take reasonable steps to ensure their own survival. However, [the
authorization to act in self-defense can [lead to serious moral
problems]{.mark} as soldiers may apply lethal force to defend themselves
in ways that endanger civilians]{.underline}. 38 [The right of
self-defense can [provide an excuse for attacking]{.mark} enemy
combatants that are hiding behind human shields or [civilians who are
misidentified]{.mark} as enemy combatants]{.underline}.

Drones free their operators from the demands of acting defensively.
[Whereas a [soldier]{.mark} on the battlefield [may have to react
quickly]{.mark} to a threat--- or even to an apparent threat that is
misidentified---a [drone operator can show restraint]{.mark} without
personally experiencing any danger. Restraint would [only endanger the
drone]{.mark} itself, and because machines do not have a right of
self-defense, the danger to them [cannot provide grounds for threatening
civilians]{.mark}]{.underline}. Drone operators' safety makes it
possible to subject them to stricter ROE, which can help to protect
civilians and civilian property from being mistakenly attacked or
incidentally harmed in attacks on enemy combatants. It lik[ewise
facilitates the proportionate use of force against clearly identified
enemy combatants as it [renders]{.mark} overwhelming attacks and
[suppressive fire unnecessary]{.mark}]{.underline} under most
circumstances.

Removing soldiers from the battlefield may also have tangential
benefits, aside from those associated with escaping the risk dilemma and
the demands of acting defensively. [Biased or impaired moral reasoning
is a serious problem in any context; [people]{.mark} have a
[tend]{.mark}ency [to import]{.mark} their [bias]{.mark}es [into
decisions and]{.mark} to [apply moral standards in self-serving
ways]{.mark}]{.underline}. However[, bias is particularly [likely during
war because of]{.mark} the [extreme circumstances]{.mark} in which
soldiers have to make ethical decisions and the sharp divisions between
competing groups.]{.underline} [Soldiers may be [affected by]{.mark}
intense [emotions]{.mark}, debilitating [stress]{.mark}, [fear, sleep
deprivation]{.mark}, and other psychological conditions that can inhibit
their moral reasoning capacities and lead them to act
unethically.]{.underline} 39 Of course, soldiers operating drones are
not neutral and can act unethically as well. They will want their own
side to win, will have self-interested reasons for justifying their uses
of force, and may experience a strong emotional connection to the human
soldiers their machines operate alongside. Nevertheless[, [drone
operators']{.mark} distance from the battlefield and security from
immediate danger [promote **greater neutrality**]{.mark} than can be
expected from human soldiers]{.underline} who are personally exposed to
the hazards of war.

#### Drones neither undermine deterrence nor spark wars. This line-by-lines the authors their cards cite!

[One of the concerns critics have raised against drones is that they
might make it easier to start wars or otherwise disrupt the series of
steps that belligerents are expected to take before they decide to
employ lethal]{.underline} force. Brunstetter and Braun argue that
drones have the potential to alter calculations about last resort in
ways that will lower inhibitions against fighting. As they see it,
drones owe much of their popularity to their capacities for allowing
wars to be waged with minimal risk and minimal force. Drones can carry
out low-intensity attacks that are narrowly targeted at particular
individuals, thereby giving the impression that they are not engaged in
war at all. 'To the extent they are successful, drones arguably raise
the threshold of last resort of large-scale military deployment by
providing a way to avoid deploying troops or conducting an intensive
bombing campaign while still counteracting perceived threats.' 25 They
go on to say that '\[b\]ecause drones are seen as a level of force short
of war, their use may also be seen as a measure to which the principle
of last resort does not apply.' 26

By most accounts, drones lower inhibitions against starting wars by
circumventing feelings of casualty aversion that would ordinarily act as
a barrier against fighting. 27 Research on casualty aversion draws much
of its strength from efforts to explain the surprising loss of the USA
in Vietnam. Some explanation was needed for why the world's most
powerful military was beaten, and by one account, the fault lies with
the American public's sensitivity to seeing its soldiers being killed
and wounded. Since Vietnam, the phenomenon of casualty aversion has been
credited with undermining the US military's fi ghting capacity and
limiting its wars, both in terms of when they are fought and in terms of
how intense they may become. The withdrawal of US forces from Somalia
following the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993 is often cited as another
prime example of the public's low casualty tolerance prompting a
de-escalation of force, 28 while the country's reluctance to commit
ground forces to stop the fi ghting in the Balkans during the 1990s
serves as an example of expected casualty aversion preventing the
deployment of military ground forces. 29

As these examples indicate, casualty aversion may constraint wars in
several ways. First, civilians may oppose a prospective military
operation when they anticipate that it is likely to incur a large number
of casualties. Second, civilians may anticipate an increase in
casualties when their leaders propose an escalation of hostilities, such
as attacking another country during an ongoing war, opening a new front
in the war, or using more destructive weapons. Third, support for an
ongoing war may fall as more soldiers are injured or killed, leading to
a more rapid cessation of hostilities.

[Kaag and Kreps' case against drones is largely premised on showing that
these machines may make it easier for the USA and other countries to
wage wars because of their potential to limit casualties.]{.underline}
They contend that 'drones create a "moral hazard" by shielding US
citizens, politicians, and soldiers from the risks associated with
targeted killings.' 30 Without the chance of losing any American
soldiers in combat, presidents are free to launch strikes whenever they
want, with relatively low risk of provoking a strong backlash or
compromising their prospects of being reelected. Some members of the
public may oppose these strikes, but with no American casualties being
sustained, most people will have little sense that a war is taking place
and that people are being injured or killed. This would make it easier
to initiate, escalate, and sustain wars without attempting to resolve
confl icts in other ways, thereby subverting the principle of last
resort.

Kaag and Kreps maintain that the moral hazard of drone warfare is
concerning not only because it may lead to a greater incidence of war
but also because it may disrupt democratic public life:

Ironically, the pressure from a democratic electorate to protect itself
from the harms of warfare will not encourage policy makers to adopt
peaceful or democratic methods...but rather methods of warfare that
leverage technology in order to insulate citizen-soldiers from harm. The
irony is this insulation creates the possibility that leaders will no
longer, in a prudential sense, have to obtain popular permission to go
to war. 31

Thus, by Kaag and Kreps' account, drones not only bring about
international instability but also processes of de-democratization that
will produce a disengaged, complacent, and powerless citizenry.

[P.W.  Singer reaches a similar assessment. He argues that one
consequence of drone warfare may be that 'the checks and balances that
undergird democracy go by the wayside]{.underline}.' 32 This will mean
that '\[a\] leader needn't carry out the kind of consensus building that
is normally needed before a war, and doesn't even need to unite the
country behind the effort.' 33 And Benjamin contends that '\[w\]ith
drone warfare, there is no need to unite the country behind a confl ict,
no need to call for shared sacrifi ce, no need for grueling debates in
Congress.' 34 Thus, these commentators suggest that lowering inhibitions
against fi ghting not only threatens to violate the principle of last
resort but also degrades the quality of democratic governance.

[These and other accounts of how drones could circumvent casualty
aversion in ways that would increase the incidence of wars raise
reasonable fears, but they do not stand up to careful scrutiny for at
least three reasons.]{.underline} First, [they are contravened by the
available evidence. The argument that drones lower the threshold for war
suggests that the USA might not have launched its counterterrorism
operations]{.underline} in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia if not for
drones, yet this is clearly untrue. [The USA has carried out hundreds of
drone strikes in those countries, but it has also relied heavily on
other weapons and tactics]{.underline}. [Special operations forces have
conducted covert raids in each country and have infl icted **higher
numbers of civilian casualties**.]{.underline} For example, the Bureau
of Investigative Journalism estimates that the 15--19 drone strikes
conducted in Somalia between 2001 and 2015 resulted in 25--108 deaths,
while the 8--11 other covert attacks killed 40--141 people, with higher
numbers of confirmed civilian fatalities. 35 Based on these numbers, the
preference for drones over alternative methods of attack seems to be
fairly modest, and [drones also appear to be inflicting more
proportionate harm.]{.underline}

[In the absence of drones, it is likely that cruise missiles or manned
aircraft would have been used to carry out less precise strikes against
at least some of the same people who were attacked by UAVs]{.underline}.
[The USA has demonstrated its willingness to use other weapons in
previous wars and counterterrorism operations, such as in the cruise
missile strikes against Sudan and Afghanistan in August
1998]{.underline} during Operation Infinite Reach. Those attacks were
analogous to the ones conducted more recently by UAVs as they were also
launched against suspected terrorists and their supporters. The [attacks
were widely considered to be a failure since they did not disrupt Al
Qaeda's operations or kill its top leaders, and probably caused civilian
deaths.]{.underline} And this is only one instance among many when the
USA and its allies used cruise missiles, aircraft, and special
operations forces to carry out small strikes. 36

The [US military was able to intervene in the Balkans, despite fears of
sustaining casualties, by relying on manned aircraft]{.underline}. 37
These are nearly as effective as UAVs in preventing US military
casualties, especially in more recent confl icts. [No Coalition combat
aircraft were shot down by enemy fi re during the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan, or in the more recent attacks against Islamic State, making
casualty aversion an unlikely deterrent against using manned aircraft to
initiate hostilities]{.underline}. The same can be said of cruise
missiles, which do not put any soldiers at risk of being killed or
captured. [Drones are roughly equivalent to these other weapons when it
comes to circumventing casualty aversion, yet they also introduce many
added benefits for conducting discriminate and proportionate
attacks]{.underline}. Thus, [even if drones do lower the bar for waging
wars, they are far from unique in doing so]{.underline} and have
compelling benefits over weapons and tactics that could be used in the
same capacities.

[Drones are not altering the course of US military operations so much as
they are making it possible for existing policies to be carried out with
greater precision]{.underline}. This suggests that [UAVs have not had
any clear effect on decisions about the resort to force.]{.underline} At
most, we can conclude that drones are one method of attack among many
others that allow belligerents to launch low-intensity attacks. And
because the [other means of doing this include special operations
forces, private military contractors, manned aircraft, and cruise
missiles, efforts to prevent wars by restricting drones are
misdirected]{.underline}. [We can **only realistically expect change via
policy** reforms that would limit when and how states can launch
low-intensity strikes of any type.]{.underline}

Second, and even more importantly, [casualty aversion is a far more
complex phenomenon than critics of drones seem to recognize. Much of the
research on casualty aversion suggests that it either does not exist or
that its importance has been greatly exaggerated]{.underline}. There are
also [instances of democracies suffering **high casualties** during a
war while still maintaining fairly **high levels of public
approval**.]{.underline} The most compelling studies of casualty
aversion have demonstrated that even when public opinion is sensitive to
losses, this is only one factor among the many that determine support
for war. Larson finds that [American civilians hope for low numbers of
casualties, but that they expect some soldiers to be wounded and killed
and are fairly open to this possibility]{.underline}. 38 Gelpi, Feaver,
and Reifl er reach a similar conclusion. Their research reveals that
[casualty aversion does exist, but that it is only one of a collection
of factors that influence support for war, the most important being
expectations of success.]{.underline} 39

Third, **[there is not a]{.underline} [perfect link between public
attitudes about war and the state's ability to wage war]{.underline}**[.
Critics who blame drones for circumventing casualty aversion suggest
that the public can easily block wars]{.underline}, and this is
doubtful[. Democracies routinely initiate wars that are only favored by
a small majority or that lack majority support.]{.underline} One poll
found that [only around 36 % of people in the UK favored the 2003
invasion of Iraq, yet public opposition to the war failed to
prevent]{.underline} it. 40 The leaders who enter, escalate, or fail to
resolve unpopular wars risk losing the next election if they defy the
public's wishes, but they may consider a calculated risk to be
worthwhile. [The leaders who were responsible for the Iraq War were
willing to contravene public opinion because they thought they would be
vindicated and rewarded with a surge in popularity once they were
victorious.]{.underline} 41 This kind of [wishful thinking may blind
policymakers to public opinion and prepare them to risk sustaining
casualties]{.underline}---particularly if their casualty estimates are
also unrealistically low as they were at the outset of the Iraq War. The
lesson we can derive from this is that [even if using drones may reduce
public opposition to a war, it is implausible to think that some
relatively small shifts in public opinion will be decisive in
determining whether war will break out.]{.underline}

#### Drone warfare is preferable to human -- fully constrained to ROE

[Equally worrying is the prevalence of accidental attacks on civilians
who are mistaken for enemy combatants]{.underline}. [Soldiers must
operate under conditions of profound uncertainty---often having little
knowledge of where enemies are and when an attack may come]{.underline}.
This is particularly true during counterinsurgency operations, when
opponents do not wear uniforms or occupy a clearly demarcated area.
[Uncertainty forces soldiers to make quick judgments about who to attack
based on the limited information available]{.underline}. For example,
those guarding convoys during the recent conflicts in Iraq and
Afghanistan had to quickly evaluate approaching vehicles to decide which
were potentially dangerous. In many instances, they were [forced to make
critical decisions about whether to use lethal force to defend
themselves, despite having little sense of which vehicles contained
civilians and which contained enemy fighters]{.underline}. 31 A car
speeding toward a checkpoint could contain civilians who innocently
failed to notice the checkpoint warning signs or it could contain
suicide bombers. [Soldiers only have a few seconds to guess about the
occupant's identity.]{.underline} This led to many mistaken attacks on
civilians who inadvertently acted in ways that made them appear
threatening and triggered soldiers' right to act defensively.

A [drone operator does not have to make decisions about whether to use
suppressing fire or whether to attack potential threats that have not
been clearly identified.]{.underline} [Because drones allow their
operators to escape the need to act in self-defense, they may be
subjected to inviolable ROE. Whereas human soldiers are allowed to
return fi re against enemy combatants when fighting within a populated
area, drone operators may be forbidden from engaging enemies when there
is a high risk of harming civilians]{.underline} without putting any
human soldiers at risk. Not only can drones be employed without
permitting any exceptions in the ROE, but also the [moral logic of
self-defense dictates that they must be used in this way. Machines do
not have a right to self-defense]{.underline} or any comparable right
that could plausibly override the rights of civilian bystanders, and [no
threat to these machines can trigger their operators' defensive
rights]{.underline}. Moreover, because [drones are far more resilient
than human soldiers, the effects of attacks on them will be milder. A
human soldier could be killed or seriously injured by small arms fi re,
but a drone that is designed to withstand intense gunfire might only
have its armor damaged]{.underline}. In other words, drones not only
lack defensive rights that could excuse deviations from ROE but also
have increased survival capacities, which only add further reason to
grant them no exceptions for acting in ways that could threaten
civilians.

Thus, drones enable armed forces to employ much stricter ROE and tactics
that shift the burden of risk away from civilians, while also making it
possible to eliminate the possibility of soldiers invoking their right
of selfdefense in ways that would allow them to escape the ROE. When
taken together, the [effect that drones have on resolving the balance of
risks problem and eliminating occasions for self-defense provides the
basis for holding belligerents to extremely demanding standards of jus
in bello conduct.]{.underline}

#### Critics of autonomous drones cherry-pick theoretical drones, but autonomous drones are limited by human intervention

[Attempts to show that autonomous drones are inherently immoral are
unconvincing since it is far from clear that they would be unable to
distinguish between combatants and civilians]{.underline}, as Sharkey
and other critics maintain. Claims that these machines would be immoral
are only compelling if autonomous drones are inherently indiscriminate.
They lack force if drones are as discriminate or more discriminate than
human soldiers. W[hether drones turn out to be better or worse at
respecting civilians' rights is yet to be seen, and it is diffi cult to
show that these drones would be absolutely immoral without stronger
evidenc]{.underline}e---particularly when existing autonomous weapons
have been in service for years and performed fairly reliably.

As I discussed in previous chapters, [it seems very unlikely that any
nonautonomous or semi-autonomous drone could qualify as being inherently
immoral. An inherently immoral machine would have to be incapable of
being used discriminately and proportionately, likely to cause superfl
uous suffering, or possessing a latent potential that strongly favors
immoral or illegal conduct.]{.underline} Armed forces do not currently
seem to have any interest in developing drones that have built-in moral
faults. Just the opposite, [they have introduced drones that are
designed to conduct limited attacks at narrowly defi ned targets,
setting higher standards than ever for using violence in ethically
circumscribed ways]{.underline}. It is on this basis that we can say
that non-autonomous drones are morally justifi able.

The [same evaluative criteria can be applied to machines that can kill
without being directly controlled by a human operator. Autonomous
weapons and drones that have a low degree of independence,]{.underline}
such as CIWS or even attack drones that seek their own targets according
to carefully formulated protocols, may not have a person directly in
control of the targeting decision, yet [they do act in ways that have
been established by human developers. Because these machines are
designed by humans to fulfi ll specifi c purposes, and in ways that
create latent potentials for action that may be subject to moral
evaluation, these machines are akin to other weapons or
drones.]{.underline} A human may not be directly responsible for
ordering these kinds of autonomous drones to fi re at a particular
target, yet [**people create the guidelines for conducting attacks** and
this leaves people fi rmly in control of how the weapons
act]{.underline}.

[Machines with a more substantive form of autonomy, s]{.underline}uch as
those that Sparrow 8 describes being akin to human soldiers, [would be a
much different type of entity than machines that have limited freedom to
deviate from established protocols.]{.underline} These would not merely
be weapons platforms, but would rather have their own agency that could
deserve moral valuation in itself. Nevertheless, [machines possessing
this type of agency could still be judged in terms of their latent
potentials]{.underline}. After all, such [machines would be autonomous
based on parameters that were established by a human
developer]{.underline}. Their [agency would be rooted in a computer
program that was written by a person, even though the programming sets
the preconditions for acting beyond the scope of any initial operating
rules.]{.underline} Such a [machine could therefore be judged based on
the extent to which its programming permits it to act in particular ways
or develop certain tendencies.]{.underline} A machine that fi ts the
description Sparrow provides could well be considered immoral for the
same reason that poison gas is immoral---the weapon's mercurial nature
would make its effects unpredictable, thereby violating the principle of
discrimination.

With these points in mind, we can see [that it is impossible to classify
all autonomous drones as]{.underline} being morally permissible or
[immoral for the same reason that it is impossible to classify all
non-autonomous drones as being morally permissible or
immoral.]{.underline} Whether autonomous or nonautonomous, [drones
should be classifi ed as being comparatively more or less moral than
other weapons that perform the same task]{.underline}. An [autonomous
drone would only be inherently immoral on the same grounds that any
other weapon or weapons platform could be inherently
immoral]{.underline}---if there was little or no possibility of using
the weapon according to the strictures of just war theory and
international law. [Certain versions of autonomous drones might be
immoral in this sense, but this would only provide grounds for objecting
to those specifi c versions]{.underline} and not for decrying autonomous
drones that have greater potential for being used in responsible ways.

To a large extent, the debate over the morality of autonomous drones
comes down to a disagreement over what latent potentials these weapons
will have. [Those who think that autonomous drones could be morally
advantageous are typically very clear in saying that this holds true
only under specifi c conditions: when the machines are programmed to
rigidly adhere to ROE, have been rigorously tested, and are capable of
being overridden by human commands]{.underline}. Conversely, [those who
object to autonomous drones describe them as being prone to
malfunctions, having unreliable targeting protocols, and being capable
of disregarding their ROE]{.underline}. Which side is right in this
debate? It [depends on what autonomous drones are actually
like]{.underline}. If they have the characteristics attributed to them
by their proponents, then autonomous drones would be morally
permissible. If they have the characteristics attributed to them by
their critics, then they would be immoral. At this stage of their
development, the [character of autonomous weapons is so highly
speculative that we cannot say with any confi dence what these machines
would actually be like]{.underline}, yet we can be fairly certain of the
conditions under which an autonomous weapon would be permissible or
objectionable.

[We should give up on efforts to show that autonomous drones are either
moral or immoral as a class of weapons platforms and instead pass
judgment on specifi c machines based on their latent
potentials]{.underline}. If it turns out that belligerents are negligent
in their deployment of these drones or that most prospective variants of
them appear to increase the likelihood of immoral conduct, then we would
have a prudential basis for restricting the development and use of
autonomous drones. [If belligerents develop autonomous drones that are
rigorously tested and programmed to strictly follow demanding ROE, then
we would have reason to support their use.]{.underline}

"The future of war: could lethal autonomous weapons make conflict more
ethical?," AI & Society, 35, 273--282 (2020), dml) \[LAWs=lethal
autonomous weapons\]

To begin, one of the most compelling reasons for opposing nuclear
non-proliferation efforts is that the destructive potential of nuclear
weapons increases the threshold of use (Jürgen 2008; Wilson 2012). Thus,
only in extreme circumstances would rational actors deem their use to be
either morally or strategically acceptable. This strongly contrasts with
the case of LAWs, whose cost would be small compared to the cost of
paying military personnel. Consequently, states could maintain
stockpiles of LAWs that are far larger than any standing army. [The low
cost of LAWs would also make them **more expendable**]{.underline} than
human soldiers (Jacoby and Chang 2008; Singer 2009a, b; Jenks 2010),
[and they could strike]{.underline} the enemy [with **greater
precision**]{.underline} than human scolders can currently achieve
(Thurnher 2012; Ekelhof and Struyk 2014). [These]{.underline} four
properties---low cost, military effectiveness, expendability, and
precision---[could **drive proliferation** while **lowering the
threshold for use** and, therefore, **undermine geopolitical
security**]{.underline}. Incidentally, similar claims could be made
about anticipated future nanotech weaponry (see Whitman 2011).

[The attractiveness of LAWs is **apparent** in the US's use
of]{.underline} "unmanned aerial vehicles" (UAVs, also known as
"**[drones]{.underline}**") in Iraq and Syria. These semi-autonomous
systems offer a cheap, effective, and relatively precise means for
conducting surveillance and targeting enemy combatants \[despite
unsatisfied infrastructural needs to sustain the drone program\] (McLean
2014). As a result, the US drone program has grown and the frequency of
drone use against terrorist organizations like the (now-defunct) Islamic
State has steadily increased in the past decade (Higgins 2017). Yet [the
proliferation of LAWs]{.underline} discussed in this paper [is
**different in important respects**]{.underline} from the proliferation
of current UAV devices. [[LAWs are]{.underline}]{.mark} theoretically
[**capable of [becoming moral actors]{.mark}** capable of making life
and death decisions **[without human intervention]{.mark}**. The
[absence of a human operator suggests]{.mark} that [LAWs will be]{.mark}
even [cheaper than current UAVs]{.mark} and]{.underline}, as such, [more
vulnerable to proliferation. But this **might not be undesirable** given
that]{.underline}, for example, [[ethical LAWs will]{.mark}---**almost
[by definition]{.mark}**---**[not]{.mark} serve to [glorify]{.mark}**
[or **extend war efforts** beyond]{.mark} the [initial
scope]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, [UAVs still require human
intervention and]{.underline}, as we will soon discuss, [the
[**emotional volatility** of humans]{.mark} could [lead to
**overspending** and **high death tolls**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

More generally speaking, [the [growing use of UAVs]{.mark} in conflict
situations [is]{.mark} consistent with [a]{.mark} **broader [trend
toward high-precision weaponry]{.mark}** and **[away from
larger]{.mark}**, **more [destructive weapons]{.mark}**
[like]{.mark}]{.underline} those in the world's **[[nuclear
arsenals]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Wilson 2013). [There are]{.underline}
some **[reasons for welcoming this shift]{.underline}**. For example,
[the use of high-precision weapons like [LAWs]{.mark} to achieve a
state's military objectives could [**reduce the probability** and
**proportion of indiscriminate harm**]{.mark}, thus violating the LoW
and]{.underline} "rules of engagement" ([RoE]{.underline}) **[less than
might otherwise have been possible]{.underline}**. Even more, [the
"**[ease-of-use]{.mark}**" of LAWs]{.underline} that are fully
autonomous [could enhance the "**balance of terror**" that [**prevents
conflict from breaking out** by providing a **credible means for
retaliation**]{.mark}: "If you strike me first, I will unleash a swarm
of LAWs that devastate your infrastructure, poison your streams, set
fire to your farms, destroy your armies, and assassinate your
leaders."]{.underline}

[The [precision and effectiveness of LAWs]{.mark} could also
**[accelerate]{.mark} the process of [nuclear disarmament]{.mark}**,
[seeing as]{.mark} the conception of [LAWS]{.mark} [regards]{.mark} them
as [agents capable of conventional weapons use rather
non-conventional]{.mark} weapons platforms]{.underline}. First, consider
that research on the potential climatic consequences of a nuclear war
resulted in the replacement of MAD ("mutually-assured destruction") with
SAD ("self-assured destruction"). The reason is that [an [exchange of
nuclear weapons]{.mark}---[even]{.mark} a [regional]{.mark}
one]{.underline} \[citation\]---[could [initiate]{.mark} a "**[nuclear
winter]{.mark}**" [that causes **global ag**]{.mark}**ricultural
[failures]{.mark}**, **widespread starvation**, the **spread of
infectious [disease]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} other
**[catastrophi]{.mark}c sequelae**]{.underline} that cannot be contained
within national borders (Mills et al. 2014; Xia et al. 2015).
Consequently, a nuclear war would all but guarantee the
self-annihilation of states involved. As Seth Baum (2015) notes, though,
[[LAWs]{.mark} could [provide]{.mark}]{.underline} a kind of
["**[winter-safe deterrence]{.mark}**" [by providing states with a
credible threat of retaliation **without**]{.mark} **the global
catastrophic [risks of nuclear conflict]{.mark}**. Thus, [LAWs]{.mark}
could **[render]{.mark} the world's [nuclear arsenals
irrelevant]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}]{.underline}, in doing so, **[[lower
the]{.mark} overall [risk]{.mark} [of]{.mark} human
[annihilation]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### Disarm---2NC

#### Winter-safe deterrence outweighs the risks of LAW prolif.

**Schulzke, 16**---assistant professor in International Relations at the
University of York (Marcus, "Evaluating Autonomous Drones," *The
Morality of Drone Warfare and the Politics of Regulation*, Chapter 5, pg
149-171, SpringerLink, dml)

[One **could** argue that]{.underline} the character of [the [drone arms
race could]{.mark} **change** and [lead to]{.mark} the creation of
[weapons that are **less capable** of]{.mark} being [operated in]{.mark}
accordance with [moral]{.mark} and legal [restrictions, yet]{.mark} this
**[does not appear likely]{.mark}**]{.underline} for two reasons. First,
[part of the [impetus for developing]{.mark} more powerful
[weapons]{.mark} in the past [was due to]{.mark} the weapons'
**[inaccuracies]{.mark}**. The Soviet Union developed far more powerful
nuclear warheads]{.underline} than the USA [and had a nuclear strike
doctrine that was more heavily based on attacking civilian
populations]{.underline} ('countervalue targeting' in the language of
nuclear strategy). 44 This was partly [[due to the Soviet's
**poor**]{.mark}**er [targeting]{.mark} systems**, which were unable to
accurately hit American nuclear facilities and [had to
**compensate**]{.mark} for that weakness [by delivering **more
destructive warheads**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} By contrast, the
USA had more accurate targeting systems and correspondingly tended to
favor strikes against enemy military targets ('counterthreat
targeting'). [[Drones]{.mark} make it possible to [identify]{.mark} and
attack targets [with]{.mark} **greater [accuracy]{.mark}** than ever
before, thereby **[obviating]{.mark}** the [need for]{.mark}
'**countervalue**' strikes or for **overpowered
[WMDs]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[There is]{.mark} a **[chance]{.mark}** that]{.underline} the current
trends in drone innovation will not persist and that [[drones
will]{.mark} **one day** [become more **destructive** and
**indiscriminate**]{.mark}]{.underline} weapons, [**despite**
indications to the contrary]{.underline}. [It [would be
**naïve**]{.mark} to suggest that this is]{.underline} an
**[impossible]{.underline}** outcome, especially given the challenges
inherent in predicting the unintended consequences of technological
development. [**Nevertheless**, this [risk is **outweighed** by]{.mark}
the [potential for drones to **mitigate**]{.mark} **wars'
[destructiveness]{.mark}** [and can be **managed**]{.mark}
**politically**]{.underline}. In recent decades, [[states have]{.mark}
made **unprecedented [efforts]{.mark}** [to reduce]{.mark} stockpiles
of, and prevent [violence using]{.mark}, a **broad [range]{.mark}** [of
morally questionable weapon]{.mark}s, including nuclear weapons,
landmines, weapons platforms in space, and chemical
weapons]{.underline}. 45 As I will discuss in Chapters 7 and 8, [efforts
to **regulate**]{.underline} war and the use of particular weapons [can
also help to ensure that drone development **continues** on its current
trajectory]{.underline}.

#### Nuclear war is [inevitable]{.underline} absent a shift to [winter-safe deterrence]{.underline}---magnitude [outweighs probability]{.underline} and you should treat the timeframe as [instantaneous]{.underline} 

**Baum, 15**---executive director, Global Catastrophic Risk Institute
(Seth, "Winter-Safe Deterrence: The Risk of Nuclear Winter and Its
Challenge to Deterrence," Contemporary Security Policy 36(1): 123-148,
dml)

Another important point is that, as long as deterrence succeeds in
avoiding conflict, nuclear winter is irrelevant, and large nuclear
arsenals can be kept. The problem is that [deterrence could
**fail**]{.underline}. Indeed, [deterrence becomes **likely to fail**
over **long periods of time**]{.underline}.43 [A **careful reading of
history** suggests that nuclear deterrence has **already failed** or
**almost failed several times**]{.underline}. For example, [the Soviet
nuclear arsenal **did not deter Kennedy's escalation** during the
**Cuban missile crisis**]{.underline}.44 Even since the end of the Cold
War, [**false alarms** have threatened to **inadvertently trigger
nuclear war**]{.underline}, such as the 1995 Norwegian rocket incident,
[suggesting an **ongoing risk of inadvertent nuclear
war**]{.underline}.45 It is unreasonable to assume nuclear deterrence
will never fail. Furthermore, [even if the probability of nuclear war is
**low**, the consequences are **so severe** that it constitutes a
**large risk**]{.underline}.

At some point, nuclear deterrence could become unnecessary if nuclear
weapon states cease to consider each other adversaries at a level
requiring nuclear deterrence.46 Indeed, nonadversarial relations may be
in the process of happening.47 But it is a slow process. Meanwhile,
[**each successive year** that nuclear weapons still exist is a **year
in which they could be used**. Tensions can **flare up at any
time**]{.underline}; the ongoing (at the time of this writing) Ukraine
crisis is a worthy reminder of this. [The possibility of inadvertent
nuclear war from random false alarms suggests that nuclear war **might
even be possible during periods of low tensions**. **Faster solutions**
than achieving non-adversarial relations are **worth
pursuing**]{.underline}.

Aside from abandoning the doctrine of deterrence and achieving
non-adversarial international relations, there are at least two
additional options for reducing nuclear winter risk. One option is to
make preparations for surviving nuclear winter. This could include
stockpiles of food and other necessities, or some means of producing
them during the years of nuclear winter.48 It could also include
shielding against UV radiation. Additional preparations regarding
security and governance institutions, telecommunications, or other
sectors may further be necessary and/or desirable. If such preparations
are made, then nuclear winter might not be an especially severe global
catastrophe. Such preparations would be additionally desirable by making
human civilization more resilient to a variety of other local and global
catastrophes.49 Perhaps nuclear weapon states could sponsor such
preparations in exchange for keeping their nuclear weapons.50 At a
minimum, nuclear weapon states would want such preparations for their
own countries to keep their citizens alive, just as they would seek to
provide gas masks, bomb shelters, and other civil defence measures. This
may be enough to avoid a permanent collapse of global civilization,
though it would still put civilization and its members in an
uncomfortable position (to say the least) for a period on the order of
10 years.

The other option is **[deterrence with winter-safe
weapons]{.underline}**. Such weapons [would achieve deterrence goals
**without threatening catastrophic nuclear winter**, or any other
**global catastrophe**. Given the **enduring role of deterrence** in
security policy, the **difficulty of quickly achieving nonadversarial
international relations**, the **possibility that deterrence could
fail**, and the **discomforts of surviving nuclear winter**, winter-safe
deterrence is **worth consideration**]{.underline}. While some people
have claimed that nuclear weapons are the only viable deterrents,51
there has been little systematic evaluation of the available options.

The Search For Winter-Safe Deterrence

[Winter-safe deterrence is military force that can]{.underline} (1)
[offer **adequate deterrence**]{.underline}, as judged by today's
nuclear weapon states, [while]{.underline} (2) [**keeping the world safe
from nuclear winter** or other **global catastrophes**]{.underline}.
Before diving into the details of specific weapons, it is worth
considering important attributes of a deterrent. The essence of a
deterrent is to dissuade other actors from taking certain actions: 'If
you do X, then I will do Y'. [The deterrent **must be perceived as
threatening something** that the other side values]{.underline}, such as
military forces, political leadership, civil infrastructure, and the
health and lives of civilians. The threat (Y) must be perceived as so
bad that it outweighs the benefits of the initial action (X).
[Deterrence is ultimately **psychological**, and so **actually
threatening something is not strictly necessary**, as long as there is
the **perception of threat**]{.underline}. However, the forthcoming
analysis focuses on what the various weapons actually threaten, under
the assumption that the perceived threat is similar. Additional
psychology is discussed when it is known, such as in the fears induced
by certain types of weapons.

### Peacekeeping---1NC

#### Autonomous weapons will prolif [incrementally]{.underline}, which ensures [safe development]{.underline} and [regulation]{.underline}---solves [global peacekeeping]{.underline}---[limiting]{.underline} development [fails]{.underline}, but prevents [effective regs]{.underline} and causes [more dangerous prolif]{.underline} 

**Bento, 15**---lawyer in New York specializing in international dispute
resolution (Lucas, "\'Killer Robots\' Need Regulation, Not a Ban,"
<https://thediplomat.com/2015/02/killer-robots-need-regulation-not-a-ban/>,
dml)

First, [a ban would be **unworkable** in practice. It would ignore the
**practical complexities** of international cooperation]{.underline}.
Without the ratification of major military powers, [a ban would be
**impossible to enforce**. The temptation for states to **cheat** is
also **obvious**. Given the **sensitive nature** of military technology,
states may, **despite a ban**, **preemptively develop** autonomous
weapons just to **stay in the race**]{.underline}. This of course is a
classic example of the prisoner's dilemma, and explains why [a state
**would likely not cooperate** with a ban, but instead **heavily arm
itself**.]{.underline}

[This dynamic is particularly true in this day and age where non-state
actors, such as terrorist organizations, are **increasingly powerful**
and **active** on the international stage. As technology becomes more
affordable and technical skill readily accessible, it is **only a matter
of time** before non-state actors use automated weapons]{.underline}.
U.S. authorities have already uncovered terrorist plans of drone
attacks, and the New York Police Department is also taking these threats
seriously.

In their upcoming book The Future of Violence, Professor Gabriella Blum
and Benjamin Wittes argue that [advances in cyber technology and
robotics could mean **more people than ever before** have access to
potentially dangerous technologies. The trend towards the dissemination
of **open source software**, which could make a killer robots' software
**widely available**, coupled with the **increased affordability** and
**versatility** of hardware makes that scenario **all the more
plausible**]{.underline}.

Second, [a toothless ban would **undermine** a **more realistic
alternative**: to **regulate the use** and **application** of autonomous
weapons through **law** and **best practices**. International
humanitarian law (IHL) **already regulates** the means and methods of
warfare. In order to comply with IHL, an autonomous robot would **need
to be able to distinguish** between combatants and civilians and use
force proportionally. These requirements are **all within the ambit of
technological possibility**]{.underline}.

Unlike a human being, [a robot can be **programmed to comply** with
rules and codes **free from fear**, **prejudice**, and **fatigue**. It
may thus be able to **better process information**, **identify
targets**, and **protect civilians**. It could **tap into big data** to
further improve its decisions]{.underline}. As an added method of
accountability, robots could be required to wear a camera in order to
monitor compliance with IHL.

[Terminator-like robots are **unlikely to be deployed on the battlefield
anytime soon**. Autonomous robots will likely **first** be used on
**very specific missions**, thus **controlling their scaling** and
**impact**, and will be developed **iteratively**, thus facilitating
**feedback** and **future improvements**]{.underline}.

Finally, [autonomous weapon systems can provide **major benefits to
international peace** and **security**. Given the potential for machine
learning, autonomous robots could be **more precise**, **discriminate**,
and **effective** than other weapons. Alternative configurations of
these systems could also be used in **peacekeeping missions around the
world**. They may help **safeguard humanitarian convoys**, **protect
refugee camps**, and **assist hostage rescue missions**]{.underline}.

[The world seems to be getting more dangerous]{.underline}. Terrorism
and the 'war on terrorism' are straining relations between Muslims and
the West. [Despite interstate wars being in decline, five attacks by a
state on another have occurred in the new century. [Competition]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} oil and other essential natural [resources]{.mark} [makes
**inter-state wars**]{.mark} over territory]{.underline}, viewed as a
thing of the past (John Mueller, 1989), [[more imaginable]{.mark}.
[Confrontations over **nuclear**]{.mark} [**weapons** have arisen with
**North Korea** and]{.mark} **[Iran]{.mark}**. Longstanding [arms
control]{.mark} regimes are [unraveling]{.mark}. Further **[intra-state
conflicts]{.mark}** [could erupt]{.mark}, as closed regimes face violent
oppositions; [fledgling **democracies** destabilize]{.mark};
[and]{.mark} post-conflict countries [fall back]{.mark} [into
war]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gurr and Marshall, 2005). [Trends such as
[**environmental degradation**, **climate**]{.mark} [**change**,
**population growth**]{.mark}, chronic **[poverty]{.mark}**,
**[globalization]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} increasing [**inequality**
risk]{.mark} [future conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., CNA, 2007).
[Facing such threats, [governments]{.mark}]{.underline} and
international bodies [[could]{.mark} be pursuing how to [**prevent
escalation** of]{.mark} emerging [tensions into]{.mark}
[wars]{.mark}]{.underline}, thus avoiding the immense human suffering
and problems that wars always cause, both for the countries involved and
the rest of the world. 1 Compared to the huge costs of war, the costs of
preventing it are dramatically less. 2 Many people are convinced the
horrific human costs of the current Iraq War were avoidable.
[**[Statistical research]{.mark}** on third-party diplomacy also
[supports]{.mark} the belief [that acting]{.mark} [before]{.mark} high
levels of [conflict]{.mark} intensity [is better]{.mark} [than trying to
end them]{.mark}]{.underline} (Miall, 1992: 126; Berkovitch, 1986, 1991,
1993). 3 [To try to head off more future conflicts seems
possible]{.underline}, moreover, [for armed conflict has
declined]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War, in part [because of
an 'extraordinary upsurge of activism by the international community
that has been directed to conflict prevention]{.underline}, peacemaking,
and peacebuilding' (Human Security Report, 2005: 155). 4 Indeed,
conflict prevention is now official policy in the UN, the EU, the G-8,
and many states (Moolak, 2005: G-8). [It has been tried in places where
the risk of conflict was present but they were averted, such as
SouthAfrica, Macedonia, the Baltics, Crimea, and the South China
Sea]{.underline}. 5 In short, prevention is not simply a high ideal, but
a prudent option that sometimes works (cf. Jentelson, 1996; Zartman,
2001: 305f; Miall, 2007: 7,16,17). Given the evidence that inaction is
wasteful and preventive labors can bear fruit, [international actors
could be]{.underline} collecting and [applying what has been
learned]{.underline} from recent experience [to manage the tensions
around the world from which future conflicts will emerge:
[mitigating]{.mark} sources of **[terrorism]{.mark}** and extremism;
[averting **genocides**]{.mark} and other mass atrocities; [buttressing
fragile governments]{.mark}; [reducing **w**]{.mark}eapons of
**[m]{.mark}**ass **[d]{.mark}**estruction; [alleviating]{.mark}
[competition over **oil** and **water**]{.mark}; [and]{.mark}
[defusing]{.mark} inter-state [rivalries such as **China**]{.mark}--
[**Taiwan** and among the **major powers**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet
these actors show little interest in building on recent accomplishments
to reduce the current risks (e.g., the deterioration of Zimbabwe and
possible renewed war between Ethiopia and Eritrea). 6 Why this apparent
gap exists between the promise of conflict prevention and its more
deliberate pursuit is the puzzle this chapter seeks to unravel. 7 The
following sections seek to get beyond conventional answers by examining
three facets of conflict prevention that define its current status:
concepts, activities, and impacts. The conclusion sums up the state of
the art and offers ideas to advance it. WHAT IS CONFLICT PREVENTION? A
DISTINCT PERSPECTIVE As the idea has come into vogue, 'conflict
prevention' and synonyms such as 'preventive diplomacy' and 'crisis
prevention' are bandied about more loosely. New government units and
non-governmental organizations have sprung up that tout the term in
their logos. To be au courant, established organizations add it to
mission statements. But though 'conflict prevention' may now be heard
more often than the previously dominant 'conflict resolution,' it is not
clear whether the activities carried out under this new rubric are
actually new. Despite the ambiguity due to the idea's rise to fame,
however, close analysts have hammered out a core definition. Knowledge
can cumulate when people use the same terms for inquiry. Conflict
prevention applies to peaceful situations where substantial physical
violence is possible, based on typical indicators of rising hostilities.
Everyday spates where no blood is spilled, or public controversies that
get so rancorous that social groups stop communicating are socially
unhealthy, but much less grievous than states or groups about to kill
each other with deadly weapons. 8 A coup d'etat is less grave than the
genocide of hundreds of thousands of people. 9 Though thus narrowed to
conflicts with potentially wide lethality (hereafter 'conflicts' for
short), specialists' definitions have varied in two main respects: a)
the stage or phase during the emergence of violence when prevention
comes into play; and b) its methods of engagement, which are geared to
the differing drivers of potential conflicts that preventive efforts
address. 10 Moments for prevention Conflict prevention has been
distinguished from other approaches to conflict mainly by when it comes
into play during a conflict, not how it is done. When UN Secretary
General Hammerskjold first coined 'preventive diplomacy' in 1960, he had
in mind the UN keeping superpower proxy wars in thirdworld countries
from escalating into global confrontations. When the end of the Cold War
brought unexpected intra-state wars such as in Yugoslavia, UN Secretary
General Boutros- Ghali extended Hammerskjold's term in an upstream
direction to mean not simply keeping regional conflicts from going
global, but from starting in the first place (UN, 1992). This conceptual
breakthrough shifted the moment for taking action back to stages when
non-violent disputes were emerging but had not escalated into
significant violence or armed conflict. Just how far back in the
etiology of conflicts might preventive action go to work? Leaving the
pre-violent period open to a possible infinite regress might extend it
to to causes as primordial as original sin or as dispersed as
child-rearing practices, thus dooming the concept to impracticality. 11
To mark a beginning point when preemptive actions first become
practicable, Peck (1995) usefully delineated early and late prevention.
The former seeks to improve the relationship of parties or states that
are not actively fighting but deeply estranged. Left unaddressed, such
latent animosities might revert to the use of force as soon as a crisis
arose. 12 Late prevention pertains to when fighting among specific
parties appears imminent. Boutros-Ghali also extended conflict
prevention downstream to actions to keep violent conflicts from
spreading to more places. But because such 'horizontal' escalation
seemed to go beyond averting the rise to violence ('vertical'
escalation) and thus to include containing open warfare, some analysts
worried that it implied suppressing physical violence at any subsequent
stage in an armed conflict. This would conflate it too easily with
actions in the middle of wars (even though Boutros-Ghali offered the
separate term 'peacemaking' for those). Bringing prevention into the
realm of active wars would eclipse its proactive nature behind the
conventional interventions that occur late in conflicts, for which terms
like conflict management, peace enforcement or peacekeeping were more
fitting. This merging would vitiate the pre-emptive uniqueness of
prevention compared to those other concepts (cf. Lund, 1996). It would
forego the opportunity to test the central premise that had animated
this new post-Cold War notion: that [acting before violent conflicts
fully breaks out is likely to be more effective than acting on a war in
progress]{.underline}. To think of prevention as occurring while wars
are already waging not only disregards most people's connotation of
'prevention,' but would relegate the international community to
remediating costly war after costly war in a perpetual game of catchup,
foregoing the chance to ever get ahead of the game. While some analysts
continued to apply prevention to any subsequent level of violent
conflict (Leatherman et al. 1999), most now confine it to actions to
avoid the eruption of social and political disputes into substantial
violence, keeping the emphasis squarely on stages before, rather than
during violent conflicts. In particular, the focus of this chapter is
'primary prevention' of prospective new or 'virgin' conflicts, where a
peaceful equilibrium has prevailed for some years, but fundamental
social and/or global forces are producing new controversies, tensions
and disputes. 13 [However, imperative [later interventions]{.mark} are
for minimizing loss of life, they [are]{.mark} less humane and likely
[more difficult]{.mark} [because]{.mark} the [antagonists are]{.mark}
organized, armed, and deeply [invested in destroying each]{.mark}
[other]{.mark}]{.underline}. 14 Graph 15.1 locates this particular
moment in conditions of unstable peace and distinguishes it from actions
at other conflict stages. Methods of prevention Notions of prevention
have also varied with regard to the means of engagement, but here too a
consensus has emerged. The tools used depend on which causes of conflict
are targeted, and thus which providers of tools get involved.
Boutros-Ghali listed early warning, mediation, confidencebuilding
measures, fact-finding, preventive deployment, and peace zones. But
subsequent UN policy papers of the 1990s (e.g., 'Agenda for
Development') greatly expanded preventive measures to a panoply of
policies that address the institutional, socio-economic, and global
environment within which conflicting actors operate -- as diverse as
humanitarian aid, arms control, social welfare, military deployment, and
media. 15 It can now involve almost any policy sector, whether labeled
conflict prevention or not. Recent UN usage of **[['preventive
action']{.underline}]{.mark}** (e.g., Rubin, 2004)
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} [[better suited to this range
of]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially useful modalities. [[Direct and
structural instruments]{.underline}]{.mark} To classify its array of
methods, intercessory initiatives aimed at particular actors in manifest
conflicts are distinguished from [[efforts to **shape underlying
socio-economic**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[**conditions and political
institutions** and processes]{.underline}]{.mark}. The former 'direct,'
'operational,' or 'light' prevention (Miall, 2004) is more
time-sensitive and actor- or event-focused -- for example, diplomatic
demarches, mediation, training in non-violence, or military deterrence
-- and seeks to keep divisive expressions of manifest conflicts from
escalating, and thus it targets specific parties and the issues between
them. 16 Integral also is 'structural' or 'deep' prevention, meaning
actions or policies that [[address deeper]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[societal conditions that generate conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}
[between interests and/or the institutional]{.underline}, [procedural
and policy deficits or capacities]{.underline} [that determine whether
competing interests]{.underline} [are channeled and mutually adjusted
peacefully]{.underline}. These more basic factors make up the
environment within which contending actors operate and thus policies
toward them can create constraints or opportunities that shape what the
actors do. [Diverse examples]{.underline} [are [reducing]{.mark} gross
regional [disparities]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in living standards,

### Peacekeeping---2NC

#### The consilience of research indicates the [overwhelming effectiveness]{.underline} of peacekeeping. Indicts [cherrypick failures]{.underline} at the expense of [rigorously evaluating]{.underline} the wider picture, and [scholarly evaluations]{.underline} of [policy scenarios]{.underline} are essential to correct peacekeeping's flaws.

Global Policy and Strategy and an adjunct professor in the UC San Diego

University, "The Extraordinary Relationship between Peacekeeping and
Peace," British Journal of Political Science, November 24, 2020, dml)

Reality, however, tells a different story. Over the last twenty years,
[**numerous empirical studies** have examined the role of third-party
peacekeeping in **reducing violence** around the world. The data
**overwhelmingly reveal** that peacekeeping, especially UN peacekeeping,
is **surprisingly effective**. Using **different datasets** and
**statistical models**, leveraging **different time periods** and
measuring peacekeeping in somewhat **different ways**, **dozens** of
researchers at **different universities**, with **diverse funding
streams** and **different preferences**, have **all** found that
peacekeeping has a **large**, **positive** and **statistically
significant** effect on reducing violence of all sorts. Despite the very
real problems]{.underline} associated with UN peacekeeping, [it is
**remarkably effective**]{.underline} at bringing peace.

This review article has three goals. The first is to summarize the
results of past empirical research to move the debate beyond the
question of whether peacekeeping works to the more pressing questions of
how, when and why it works. The second goal is to reveal the limitations
of current quantitative studies in order to identify areas in which
scholars can make big, new contributions to the field. The final goal is
to propose a new research agenda that is heavily evaluative -- one that
informs policy makers about the specific practices, mission
compositions, and mandates that work, and also identifies the local,
regional, and international conditions that amplify or diminish
peacekeeping\'s success. This type of research could help reduce the
costs of peacekeeping operations (PKOs), eliminate some of the negative
consequences of interventions and potentially save even more lives.

What the Current Evidence Reveals

[**Numerous large-n statistical studies** have explored the relationship
between]{.underline} third-party [peacekeeping and different forms of
violence]{.underline} (Dorussen 2014; Gizelis, Dorussen and Petrova
2016); Di Salvatore and Ruggeri 2017; Sandler 2017). [What is most
striking about these studies is the **consistency** of their findings.
Almost all of them find that peacekeeping is **highly effective** at
preventing violence before it begins, reducing violence in the midst of
war and preventing violence from recurring once it has
ended]{.underline}. All else equal, [countries and regions that receive
peacekeeping missions experience **less armed conflict**, **fewer
civilian** and **combatant deaths**, **fewer mass killings**, **longer
periods of post-conflict peace** and **fewer repeat wars** than those
that do not receive peacekeepers. This relationship]{.underline} --
between peacekeeping and lower levels of violence -- [is **so
consistent** across different large-n analyses that it has become one of
the **strongest findings** in the international relations literature to
date]{.underline}.

[The power of peacekeeping is all the more striking given that the UN
tends to intervene in the **toughest cases**. Multiple scholarly studies
have found that the UN]{.underline} Security Council [tends to send
peacekeepers to countries with more violence, particularly bad
governments and ongoing conflict]{.underline} (Beardsley and Schmidt
2012; Costalli 2013; de Jonge Oudraat 1996; Fortna 2004a; Fortna 2008a;
Gilligan and Sergenti 2008; Gilligan and Stedman 2003; Hegre, Hultman
and Nygard 2019 Ruggeri, Dorussen, and Gizelis 2017). The most recent
study by Ruggeri, Dorussen and Gizelis (2018) found that UN peacekeepers
are deployed to places experiencing active conflict. Using
geographically and temporally disaggregated data on UN peacekeepers\'
deployment in eight African countries between 1989 and 2006, they find
that peacekeepers tend to be deployed to the dangerous frontlines of a
conflict. Their research did reveal some problems with deployment.
Peacekeepers tended to arrive late and be sent to conflict zones near
urban areas, ignoring violence further afield. But [the fact that
peacekeepers often go to the most demanding places]{.underline} (even if
late and disproportionately urban) [suggests that academic studies have
probably **underestimated** the effectiveness of peacekeeping at
reducing violence]{.underline}.

[These findings do not imply that peacekeeping works **all the time**,
or **as efficiently** and **successfully** as it could. There are many
well-known cases]{.underline} such as Bosnia and Rwanda [where UN
peacekeeping failed]{.underline}. There are also additional cases such
as those in South Sudan [and]{.underline} Malí where peacekeeping
missions [are not progressing well]{.underline} (Autesserre 2010;
Autesserre 2014; Day 2019; Howard 2008; Van der Lijn 2019).1 Moreover,
we understand that [the data and analyses of even the best quantitative
studies are imperfect. Analysis of peacekeeping and violence is
constrained by the messy and sometimes unreliable nature of
data]{.underline} on death rates, the potentially untenable assumptions
made by scholars in employing statistical models in cross-national and
cross-conflict analysis, and the hard constraints (both practical and
ethical) on scholars\' ability to randomize treatments in ways that make
airtight causal inferences possible. The [findings in the quantitative
literature can also appear mixed or contradictory]{.underline} on some
topics, when in fact the disparity is due to different research designs
and empirical strategies. [This can]{.underline} be confusing and can
also [**distract** from the **bigger** and **more important picture**,
which is that peacekeeping works **amazingly well** given its many
challenges]{.underline}.

In what follows we present overwhelming evidence from more than two
dozen studies that peacekeepers: (1) reduce civilian and military
deaths, (2) prevent the spread of violence, (3) help belligerents
achieve peace and (4) help countries maintain the post-conflict peace.2
We also provide an overview of the general problems related to
peacekeeping that the qualitative literature explores.

Reducing Civilian and Combatant Killing in Civil War

Since 1999, all multidimensional UN peacekeeping operations have a
mandate to protect civilians (Howard and Dayal 2018). [Do peacekeepers
protect by **reducing violence** against civilians and combatants in the
midst of war?]{.underline} To date, [**more than a dozen** quantitative
studies have examined the effect]{.underline} of peacekeeping and
outside interventions in protecting civilians, [and the answer is
**yes**]{.underline} (Costalli 2013; Carnegie and Mikulaschek 2018; Di
Salvatore 2018; Fjelde, Hultman and Nilsson 2018; Hultman, Kathman and
Shannon 2013; Kathman and Wood 2011; Kathman and Wood 2016; Bove and
Ruggeri 2016; 2018; Kirschner & Miller 2019; Melander 2009; Phayal 2019;
Phayal and Prins 2019).3 [These studies examine somewhat **distinct sets
of cases** and **time periods**, and **measure key
variables**]{.underline} slightly [**differently**. They also often use
**different research designs**. Nonetheless, **all** find that
peacekeeping or similar forces are associated with **lower levels of
violence** against citizens]{.underline}.4

We start with [a study of all intrastate armed conflicts in sub-Saharan
Africa from 1991--2008 by **Hultman**, **Kathman** and
**Shannon**]{.underline} (2013). They [find a **significant inverse
relationship** between UN peacekeeping and violence against civilians:
the **greater the number** of UN peacekeepers committed to protecting
noncombatants in these conflicts, the **fewer civilians** are
killed]{.underline}.5 [The effect is **substantial**]{.underline}. Their
analyses show that, on average, deploying several thousand UN military
personnel and several hundred UN police dramatically reduces the number
of civilians killed in a conflict.6

Why do UN military personnel and police have these beneficial effects?
Hultman, Kathman and Shannon theorize that [military personnel and
police **save civilian lives** by placing themselves between combatants,
reducing direct hostilities and decreasing the incentives to target
civilians as a tactic of war]{.underline}. They also suggest that
[robust peacekeeping forces can **impose physical barriers** between
combatants and civilian targets, making violence a **less attractive**
way for armed factions to extract support or resources from local
citizens]{.underline}.

[**Carnegie** and **Mikulaschek**]{.underline} (2020) also find that
[peacekeeping is **strongly related** to less violence against civilians
when one looks at all UN peacekeeping missions deployed to ongoing
conflicts between 1989 and 2010]{.underline}. What is particularly
noteworthy about [this study]{.underline} is that it [deals with
difficult endogeneity and selection bias issues by using an instrumental
variable approach]{.underline} -- in this case, variation in Security
Council membership. They find that the presence of UN peacekeeping
personnel (troops, police and military observers) reduces violence
against civilians in civil wars, but only if that violence is
perpetrated by rebels and not the government. This finding suggests that
peacekeeping may constrain the bad behavior of rebels more than that of
governments -- a pattern that makes sense given that governments must
consent to such missions. Phayal and Prins (2019) ask a similar
question, using original geocoded data of UN deployments in four key
African conflicts (Sudan/Darfur, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of the
Congo and Cote d\'Ivoire). They find that peacekeepers react quickly to
violence against civilians but are slower to act when governments
perpetrate such violence.

Di Salvatore (2018) confirms that UN troops reduce civilian deaths.
However, she finds that peacekeepers become less effective as the power
asymmetries between armed ethnic groups grow. In examining the UN
mission in Sierra Leone from 1997 to 2001, she finds that violence
against civilians increased when one ethnic group was very strong and
the other was quite weak.

A number of scholars look more closely at the composition of missions
and whether it helps or hurts civilians. In a study of UN peacekeeping
missions in Africa between 1991 and 2008, Bove and Ruggeri (2016, 2018)
find that peacekeepers recruited from an ethnically and linguistically
diverse range of countries and those who are culturally closer to local
populations are more successful at reducing violence against civilians.
They hypothesize that this type of diversity allows peacekeepers to
communicate more effectively with the local population, helping to deter
misconduct. This suggests that there may be an ideal composition of UN
peacekeeping missions, which includes a combination of
ethnolinguistically heterogeneous troops, police and observers who are
also culturally similar to local citizens.

Other scholars explore additional questions related to peacekeepers'
characteristics. Haass and Ansorg (2018), for example, use monthly data
on the make-up of peace operations and find that when one looks at
similarly sized peacekeeping missions, those with a large share of
troops from countries with higher-quality militaries (defined as
well-trained and equipped soldiers with significant political support)
are better able to protect civilians in conflicts.7

Do peacekeepers have a similar effect after a war has ended? Kathman and
Wood (2016) evaluate the role of UN PKOs in protecting civilians after
conflict has ended. In a study of twenty-six African countries between
1992 and 2010, they find that fewer civilians are killed if the UN is
present, and that this is inversely related to the number of UN military
troops. Once again, the size of the peacekeeping force appears to
matter. Mirroring studies by Hultman, Kathman and Shannon (2013), they
find that the opposite is true of UN observers: the greater the number
of observers, the greater the number of civilians killed. Why is this
the case? The authors argue that observers may signal that the UN is
'not deeply invested' in resolving the conflict, perhaps encouraging bad
behavior. The bottom line, however, is clear: when UN missions are
outfitted with more forces, fewer citizens are targeted and killed.

**[Melander]{.underline}** (2009) [looks at how peacekeeping conducted
by **any**]{.underline} state, global or regional
**[organization]{.underline}** -- not just the UN -- [influenced the
risk of mass killings. This study includes a **longer time
period**]{.underline} (1947 to 2004) [and a **larger number** of civil
wars]{.underline} than Hultman, Kathman and Shannon (2013). Melander
finds that [**all forms** of peacekeeping]{.underline} that included
military and/or civilian personnel [**decrease the risk** of mass
killings during civil wars]{.underline}.8 In a study of a much broader
category of military interventions by third parties between 1946 and
2005, Kathman and Wood (2011) find that outside military intervention
designed to aid the government leads to an increase in government-led
genocide and mass killing.9 The same was not true of neutral
intervention, which tends to exacerbate genocidal violence in the short
term but diminish it over time. This work suggests that [military
intervention may be able to reduce mass killings if the mission is
impartial and is willing to remain involved over a longer period of
time]{.underline}.

What about combatant deaths? [Peacekeepers]{.underline}, particularly UN
peacekeepers, [also]{.underline} appear to [reduce the number of
soldiers killed during a civil war. In a study of all intrastate armed
conflicts in Africa between 1992 and 2011, **Hultman**, **Kathman** and
**Shannon**]{.underline} (2014) [find that increasing the number of UN
armed military troops **significantly reduces violence** on the
battlefield]{.underline}. When more troops are deployed, fewer soldiers
are killed in combat. This relationship is confirmed by Beardsley,
Cunningham and White (2018), who find that a greater number of
peacekeeping troops in active African conflicts between 1989 and 2008
substantially reduces violence.10 The same is not true of police and
observers, neither of which was found to reduce the intensity of
fighting in a statistically significant way.

In sum, [the quantitative literature on peacekeeping to date has
**consistently identified a positive** and **statistically significant
relationship** between the presence of UN peacekeepers and lower rates
of civilian and combatant deaths in civil wars]{.underline}. It has also
found that a larger presence of peacekeepers is particularly
efficacious. [When one looks at **large patterns** over **long periods**
of time, the evidence is **clear**: the presence of peacekeepers in a
country **saves lives**]{.underline}.

Preventing the Spread of Violence

A second challenge associated with civil wars relates to the spread of
violence: such [conflicts can **move** from one region of a country to
another]{.underline} (Cunningham, Gleditsch and Salehyan 2009). [They
can also move across international borders]{.underline}, creating a
'contagion effect' (Braithwaite 2010; Buhaug and Gleditsch 2008;
Salehyan 2009). [Three quantitative studies assess whether peacekeepers
can **prevent** or **reduce** these types of expansion. **All find that
they do**]{.underline}.

First, Beardsley and Gleditsch (2015) explore whether peacekeepers can
prevent violent conflict from spreading within a country during a civil
war. Using geo-referenced conflict polygons between 1990 and 2010, the
authors find that peacekeeping missions that deploy at least 1,000
military personnel can limit the spread of violence geographically.11
This is especially true as the number of deployed military troops
increases: larger missions are the more likely to contain violence.12

[**Beardsley** and **Gleditsch**]{.underline} (2015) [theorize that
peacekeeping missions limit the geographic movement of violence in three
ways]{.underline}: (1) [peacekeepers make it **more difficult** for
armed units from any side to move about the country
undetected]{.underline}, (2) [they establish **protected areas** against
rebel attacks and]{.underline} (3) [they **decrease the willingness** of
government forces to use heavy-handed tactics to clear areas of rebels
and their supporters]{.underline}.

A second, more recent investigation finds that [peacekeeping can
**reduce local conflict**]{.underline} (thus also [reducing the
possibility of a widening war]{.underline}) [even when the overall war
**does not stop**]{.underline}. Using spatially disaggregated UN
peacekeeper deployment data for eight African countries between 1989 and
2006, Ruggeri, Dorussen and Gizelis (2018) find that UN peacekeeping
decreases the probability that subnational conflict (defined as conflict
between a government and rebel forces in a particular locality) will
continue for another year. This is true whether the UN deploys a small
or large number of peacekeepers, although the authors find that the
greater the number of peacekeepers sent, the more effective they are.

In a final study, **[Beardsley]{.underline}** (2011) [looks]{.underline}
specifically [at the problem of **spillover**]{.underline} across
international borders. [Using event history analysis of all states in
the international system from 1946--2005]{.underline}, Beardsley finds
that [peacekeepers]{.underline} (defined as military personnel sent to a
foreign state by the UN, a regional security organization or a group of
states) [deployed to a neighboring country can **prevent conflict from
dispersing**. If a civil war broke out and peacekeepers were stationed
in a neighboring state, the risk of spillover **did not significantly
increase**. However, if **no peacekeepers** were sent, the expected risk
of armed conflict increased by **over 70 per cent**]{.underline}.
Beardsley posits that [peacekeepers]{.underline} have this effect
because they are able to [reduce violence in two ways]{.underline}.
First, [peacekeepers make it **more difficult** for transnational
insurgencies to **move across borders**]{.underline}. Secondly, [they
inhibit the ability of external patrons to **supply nascent rebel
groups**, making it more difficult for them to **continue to
fight**]{.underline}.

Taken together, these studies suggest that [sizeable peacekeeping
missions]{.underline} (those with at least 1,000 troops) [play an
important role in **reducing the geographic spread** of conflict, both
across borders and within countries experiencing violence]{.underline}.
In what follows, we explore whether they also help combatants reach and
implement comprehensive peace agreements.

Reaching and Implementing Comprehensive Peace Agreements

[What role]{.underline}, if any, [do peacekeepers play in]{.underline}
convincing combatants to sign and implement [negotiated
solutions]{.underline} to civil wars? Once again, [the positive effect
of external peacekeepers is **striking**. At least four major empirical
studies]{.underline} have examined the role of peacekeepers on signing
and/or implementing peace agreements. All [find the **same
pattern**]{.underline}: outside [peacekeepers]{.underline} stationed in
a country during the post-treaty period [are **key** to the successful
implementation of peace settlements]{.underline}.13

The first two studies examined all civil wars initiated between 1940 and
1992. **[Walter]{.underline}** (1997, 2002) [finds that combatants are
**significantly more likely** to sign a negotiated settlement if a third
party is willing to help verify or enforce the terms]{.underline}.14
[When a third party steps in, negotiated settlements **almost always**
bring at least **five years** of peace. When a third party **does not**,
combatants **almost inevitably return** to war]{.underline}. [Combatants
appear to be **looking down the road** and **factoring in** the presence
of peacekeepers when deciding whether to sign an agreement or continue
to fight]{.underline}.

In the third study, Kathman and Benson (2019) also find that combatants
are able to end their war sooner in a negotiated settlement when the UN
commits more armed soldiers to a mission. Using monthly data on all
minor and major armed conflicts between 1992 and 2004, they find that
the greater the number of UN troops, the shorter the time to a
negotiated solution.

Finally, **[Lundgren]{.underline}** (2016) [finds that peacekeepers can
play an important role in resolving civil wars **even before they
arrive**]{.underline}. In a study of all mediation attempts by
international organizations between 1975 and 2004, he finds that
[combatants are **much more likely** to sign a peace agreement to end
their war if they expect peacekeeping and monitoring forces to be
sent]{.underline}. This suggests that [even the **prospect** of
peacekeepers can help end a civil war]{.underline}.

[These findings]{.underline} are significant for two reasons. First,
they [reveal the **crucial role** that third-party interventions can
play in resolving the **difficult strategic challenges** of
post-conflict treaty drafting and implementation]{.underline}. Secondly,
[they demonstrate that the **credible promise** of peacekeepers can
encourage combatants to sign settlements even **before** they are put in
place]{.underline}. The knowledge that a third party, including the UN,
is willing and available to help with implementation appears to motivate
combatants to consider a negotiated outcome to their war.15

Maintaining Peace in the Aftermath of War

Quantitative studies have carefully examined whether peacekeeping
prevents the resumption of civil war. [Civil wars have a surprisingly
high recidivism rate]{.underline} (Collier and Sambanis 2002). Of the
108 countries that experienced some form of civil war between
1946--2017, only 27 per cent avoided a subsequent return to war.16 How
effective is peacekeeping in preventing a war from returning?

[**Nine** large quantitative studies have attempted to determine the
role of peacekeeping in maintaining the peace once civil war has
ended]{.underline} (Collier, Hoeffler and Söderbom 2008; Doyle and
Sambanis 2000; Doyle and Sambanis 2006; Fortna 2004a; Fortna 2008a;
Gilligan and Sergenti 2008; Hartzell, Hoddie and Rothchild 2001;
Sambanis 2008; Vivalt 2015). [Additional studies assessed the role of
peacekeeping in preventing renewed interstate war]{.underline} (Fortna
2003a; Fortna 2004b; Fortna 2004c). [**All** find a **strong
relationship** between peacekeeping and longer post-war periods of
peace]{.underline}.

[**Hartzell**, **Hoddie** and **Rothchild**]{.underline} (2001) examine
the relationship between third-party enforcement of a peace agreement
and at least five years of peace after the agreement is signed.17 [In a
study of all intrastate conflicts between 1945 and 1998]{.underline},
they [find that peace agreements lasted **significantly longer** if a
third-party enforcer was present to separate or protect former
combatants from each other]{.underline}. These assurances could come
from third-party states or from regional or international
organizations.18

[In a study of all civil wars from 1944--1997,]{.underline} [**Doyle**
and **Sambanis**]{.underline} (2000; 2006) [find that multilateral UN
PKOs]{.underline} (defined as those that include extensive civilian
functions, economic reconstruction, institutional reform and election
oversight) [**increase the likelihood** that peace lasts 2--5 years
after a war ends]{.underline}.19 For Doyle and Sambanis, [this type of
peacekeeping was effective because it **signaled international
interest** in ending the conflict and **offered badly needed aid** and
**technical expertise** to the parties. Both of these
factors]{.underline} are believed to [**boost domestic capacities** and
**reduce hostility**]{.underline}.

**[Sambanis]{.underline}** (2008) looks more closely at the effect of
different types of UN peacekeeping on peace (observer missions,
traditional peacekeeping, multidimensional peacekeeping and enforcement
missions). He [finds **robust results** for the hypothesis that UN
missions have a **positive effect** on peacebuilding outcomes, and the
**longer** peacekeepers stayed in a country, the **more likely** the
peace was to last]{.underline}.

Collier, Hoeffler and Söderbom (2008) find a similar result. In a study
of all post-conflict peace periods between 1960 and 2002, they conclude
that the more money the UN spent on post-conflict peacekeeping per year,
the longer the post-war peace lasted. The effect was large: doubling
expenditures reduced the risk of renewed war from 40 to 31 per cent.

**[Fortna]{.underline}** (2008a) analyzes whether different types of
peacekeeping (broadly defined as observer, traditional, multidimensional
and enforcement) extend the duration of peace and reduce the risk of
another civil war.20 In a study of post-conflict countries between 1989
and 1999, she [finds that each type of peacekeeping mission
**significantly reduces** the risk of war]{.underline}.21 [Fortna
**conservatively** estimates that peacekeeping after the Cold War
reduced the risk of repeat war by **over half**]{.underline}. Her [less
conservative estimates point to an **even more dramatic effect**, with
the risk of war dropping by **75--85 per cent** in cases where
peacekeepers are deployed]{.underline}.22

Fortna also finds that Chapter VI consent-based missions (observation,
traditional and multidimensional missions) are as effective as the
larger and more robust Chapter VII enforcement missions at maintaining
post-conflict peace. This is quite different from the findings noted
above about missions designed to protect civilians, where bigger and
stronger missions appear to be more effective. These results suggest
that the size of a mission and its mandate may matter more if its goal
is to protect civilians in the midst of war rather than to prevent war
from restarting once it has stopped. They are consistent with
qualitative evidence in Fortna (2008b) and Howard (2019) and
quantitative evidence in Matanock and Lichtenheld (2017) that political
and economic inducements are more important than military force for
explaining how peacekeeping works to maintain peace.

Peacekeepers have also been quite effective at maintaining peace after
interstate wars. In a study of all such wars between 1947 and 1997,
Fortna (2003b, 2004b) finds that stronger peace agreements (defined as
those with more formal mechanisms, such as the deployment of
peacekeepers, a formalized agreement, third-party guarantees and dispute
settlement procedures) lead to longer periods of post-war peace after a
ceasefire agreement is signed. A related study of the effect of
peacekeeping in interstate wars over the same period finds that
peacekeeping 'helps even the most deadly of adversaries to avoid war'
(Fortna 2004c, 481).

How reliable are these findings about peacekeeping and a durable peace?
As discussed earlier, [one potential criticism is that peacekeepers
deploy to places where peace is likely to emerge with or without
peacekeepers]{.underline}. However, [studies that take this endogeneity
issue seriously continue to find that the results **hold
up**]{.underline}. Using matching techniques, [**Gilligan** and
**Sergenti**]{.underline} (2008) [confirm that UN peacekeeping missions
**significantly lengthen** the post-war peace]{.underline}. Examining
civil wars that took place between January 1988 and December 2003, they
find that [peace lasts **longer** in countries that experienced a UN
intervention than in those that did not]{.underline}.23 Vivalt (2015)
uses an instrumental variable approach to help identify the causal
effect of peacekeeping on ending episodes of conflict and maintaining
peace. She exploits the fact that membership on the Security Council
rotates, and that peacekeeping is less likely in countries holding a
seat on the council at the time. Her use of a more rigorous causal
identification strategy confirms that peacekeeping significantly
increases the duration of peace. This provides additional confidence
that the relationship between peacekeeping and post-conflict peace is
not spurious.

[The over-riding conclusion]{.underline} from all these studies [is that
peacekeeping can play an **enormous role** in reducing and preventing
violence]{.underline}.24 [When one compares cases **with** peacekeeping
to those **without**, measuring outcomes in **different ways**, and
controlling for a **wide variety** of variables, a **powerful** and
**consistent picture** emerges. Peacekeepers can **contain the spread**
of conflict within and across borders, **reduce civilian** and
**military deaths**, **make settlements more likely** and **reduce civil
war recurrence**]{.underline}. In the end, [the question is **not
whether peacekeeping works**, but how the world can enable PKOs --
especially those led by the UN -- to do an **even better
job**]{.underline}.

Mixed and Contradictory Findings

The findings from the qualitative literature tend to showcase
peacekeeping\'s problems and tend to be more pessimistic in tone than
quantitative studies.25 The qualitative literature has two general
strands -- one that engages directly with theoretical debates and
another that is more policy oriented. Here we address the former,
focusing on book-length studies that elucidate five sets of challenges
that peacekeeping must address: (1) the difficulty target societies face
in adapting to the new political and economic institutions introduced
via peacekeeping, (2) the challenges of local ownership, (3) the
tradeoffs involved with attempting to gain both internal and external
legitimacy, (4) the organizational pathologies inherent in a
multinational organization and (5) the difficulties associated with
using force. We examine each in turn.

Paris (2004) wrote an early and influential critique of peacekeeping
that examines fourteen large, multidimensional PKOs. In each case, the
UN sought to promote rapid political liberalization and economic
marketization. Paris concludes that quick, externally driven political
and economic engineering on such a large scale tends to create new
tensions and conflict. Some of Paris\' observations have been prescient.
For example, some post-conflict countries have massive crime and
corruption problems (Aoi, de Coning and Thakur 2007; Cheng and Zaum
2011). However, fifteen years after publication, Paris\' direst
predictions have not come to pass.26 Of the fourteen cases, the UN has
fulfilled its complex mandates in eleven, and none has returned to
full-scale civil war (Howard 2019a).27

Secondly, issues of 'local ownership' have plagued peace operations from
their earliest days. Pouligny\'s research (1999, 2005, 2006) has
revealed how external peacebuilders often do not understand the local
languages, customs and contexts in which they operate. This can lead to
misunderstandings and misinterpretations that reduce the helpfulness of
peacekeeping. The solution, she argues, is to include more local agents
in the peacebuilding process. Similarly, Autesserre (2010, 2014)
attributes peacebuilding failures in the Congo and elsewhere to a
peacebuilding culture that privileges national-level debates and state
building over local-level issues and peacebuilding (see also von
Billerbeck 2017). These criticisms have convinced the UN and other
peacebuilders to incorporate greater local involvement in peacebuilding
processes over time. It is too early to tell if this has enhanced UN
effectiveness or not.

Other qualitative studies view internal and external legitimacy as the
central dilemma in peacekeeping and state building. Coleman (2007)
discusses an inherent tradeoff between multinational operations that
tend to enjoy international legitimacy and local operations that have
greater internal legitimacy. Zaum (2007) similarly points out the
inherent paradox of state building: PKOs often compromise local
sovereignty in order to establish a sovereign state (see also Whalan
2013).28 Relatedly, Barma (2017) illustrates how efforts to establish
legitimate and effective political economies in Cambodia, East Timor and
Afghanistan have empowered post-conflict elites, unintentionally forging
neo-patrimonial order rather than legitimate local democracy.

A fourth strand in the qualitative literature examines organizational
pathologies and organizational learning. Barnett and Finnemore (2004)
contend that in Rwanda, a bureaucratic and rules-obsessed UN Secretariat
failed to recommend intervention to halt the genocide. Howard\'s (2008)
qualitative comparison of all completed complex peacekeeping missions
finds that some of these problems can be corrected through ground-level
organizational learning. However, Campbell (2018) reveals that
innovation at the local level often entails breaking with higher-level
organizational practices.

A final set of qualitative studies examines the thorny issue of UN
military force. Although many scholars and policy makers would like
peacekeeping missions to become more 'robust', peacekeepers, by design,
have neither the capacity nor the resolve to use compellent force
(Howard 2019a). Peacekeeping is different from other forms of military
intervention because of its three doctrinal rules of consent of the
parties, impartiality and the non-use of force (except in self-defense,
and more recently in defense of the mandate). These rules mean that
peacekeepers differ significantly from state military forces (Howard
2019b). For instance, peacekeepers in all UN missions hail from dozens
of different countries. They do not train together before they deploy.
They do not speak each other\'s languages, or share interoperable
matériel. Paddon-Rhoads (2016) illustrates how contingents of different
nationalities interpreted the mandate to use force differently in the
Congo. Most importantly, UN peacekeeping forces do not employ a standard
military chain of command and control: a force commander from one
country cannot order a battalion from another to neutralize a rebel
group unless the government of the battalion\'s sending country agrees
(Findlay 2002; Howard 2019a). Nevertheless, more often than not,
peacekeepers succeed at accomplishing their goals. Howard (2019a) argues
that peacekeepers exercise power successfully not through the use of
compellent military force, but rather through financial and
institutional inducements, and non-material forms of persuasion. Howard
traces causal mechanisms in both positive and negative cases, in
contrast with much of the qualitative literature, which is concerned
with failure alone.

[There is a reason why the **qualitative** literature tends to be
**negative** about peacekeeping while the **quantitative** literature is
**not**]{.underline}: the two literatures ask different questions and
analyze different sets of cases. [Qualitative scholars often
**explicitly select** cases of peacekeeping **failure** so as to examine
and identify what went wrong. Quantitative scholars]{.underline},
however, [tend to examine the **full range** of cases, including
failures, successes, and cases where peacekeepers were not deployed in
order to determine **larger patterns** over time and across
cases]{.underline}. Both are necessary to fully understand the
phenomenon.

Disaggregating and Expanding the Data on Peacekeeping

The quantitative literature could improve in two areas. The first is
related to data. Most recent quantitative studies rely heavily on
macro-level (country and yearly) data that are too blunt to offer
detailed policy recommendations to practitioners. We still have almost
no systematic evidence to help inform when peacekeepers should arrive in
a particular conflict, what exactly they should do once they arrive, how
long they need to stay, or how many personnel, and what types of
personnel, are needed to have the greatest chance at success given
conditions on the ground. If the UN Secretary-General were to ask
scholars how best to design a mission -- anywhere -- all scholars could
offer are generalities: 'go early', 'leave late' and 'the bigger the
force and mandate, the better'. From a policy perspective, this is not
very helpful.

Disaggregating the data based on the different contexts in which
peacekeepers operate and the different types of missions they undertake
-- which the qualitative literature is already doing -- would help
reveal what exactly works in specific environments (Gizelis, Dorussen
and Petrova 2016). We have some evidence that peace is harder to
generate and maintain when war is ongoing, when the government is
winning, when contraband resources fuel the fight, and in identity-based
or secessionist conflicts (Fortna 2008a, 18--46; Howard 2008; Costalli
2013). But this is still quite vague. PKOs are not monolithic
institutions operating in consistent environments. It almost certainly
matters whether peacekeepers operate in regions that are resource rich
or poor, rural or urban, friendly or hostile, Muslim or Christian, clan
based or tribal. Quantitative studies need to take into account the many
ways in which local actors and conditions might matter (Gizelis,
Dorussen and Petrova 2016).

Quantitative scholars are now starting to disaggregate data in ways that
facilitate more granular analysis of different types of missions,
mandates, contexts and time periods (Costalli 2013; Di Salvatore 2017;
Hultman, Kathman and Shannon 2013, 2014; Ruggeri, Dorussen and Gizelis
2016; Ruggeri, Gizelis and Dorussen 2013). Costalli (2013) was the first
to analyze the effectiveness of UN peacekeeping using local-level data.
In a study on violence and peacekeeping in the Bosnian conflict between
1992 and 1995, he found that the United National Protections Force
(UNPROFOR) was unable to reduce violence in the ongoing war because it
did not have a sufficiently clear mandate and enough manpower to stop
the violence or influence the conflict dynamics. This is a big step
forward in our understanding of peacekeeping, but much more work needs
to be done.

Scholars have also begun to expand the types of outcomes they study to
include the full range of problems peacekeepers are asked to address
(Dorussen 2014). This includes offering humanitarian assistance,
promoting human rights, establishing or re-establishing the rule of law,
instituting free elections, and supporting economic development and
social justice.29 This research, however, is still in its infancy and
the findings inconclusive. For example, we still do not know whether
peacekeepers enable good governance after a civil war. Research by
Fearon (2010) and Walter (2010, 2015) found that the presence of
peacekeepers in a country does not appear to improve the quality of
governance. However, Blair (2019, 2020) finds that it does, at least
when the data are disaggregated down to the mission level. He
demonstrates that the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) -- a peacekeeping
force of over 16,000 military personnel, civilians and police officers,
the goal of which was to monitor a ceasefire agreement -- significantly
improved governance in that country. Mvukiyehe (2018) also examines
UNMIL and finds that citizens were more likely to participate in
national politics if they had interacted with this mission, suggesting
that positive peacekeeping experiences may strengthen the rule of law
(see also Bara 2020). Further research is needed to tease out the
precise relationship between peacekeepers and good governance.

Nor have macro-level studies been able to obtain a consensus on
peacekeeping\'s effect on democratization, partly due to different
operationalizations of democracy and democratic transition. Doyle and
Sambanis (2006) argue that peacekeeping helps to foster at least a
minimal level of democracy through the terms of the settlement they
enforce. Sambanis (2008) also finds that peacekeeping has a positive
effect on political openness, especially in the short term. Pickering
and Peceny (2006) and Joshi (2013) also find empirical support for the
notion that UN interventions foster transitions to democracy. Other
studies, however, find that peacekeeping has a negligible, or no, effect
on democracy. Gurses and Mason (2008) find no significant effect of UN
peacekeeping on democratization. Fortna (2008b) finds that peacekeeping
has no clear effect on post-war democratization, and argues that the
positive and negative effects cancel each other out.30 In a more
comprehensive study on the same theme, Fortna and Huang (2012) also find
that peacekeeping has no effect. Qualitative studies that analyze
peacekeeping\'s effect on democratization also suggest mixed effects
(Sotomayor 2014; Von Hippel 2000; Zanotti 2011). These divergent results
call out for additional work on this critical relationship.

Scholars have also begun to collect individual-level data on the effects
of peacekeeping on average citizens. Gordon and Young (2017) use an
original survey of a random sample of residents in Port-au-Prince, Haiti
to determine if citizens are more likely to co-operate with peacekeepers
if the intervening forces engage in positive activities such as security
and relief activities rather than abuse. They find that they are.
Mironova and Whitt (2017) and Kelmendi and Radin (2016) use surveys to
explore how peace operations affect local attitudes toward peace
attempts. These micro-level data offer more nuanced insights into
questions of legitimacy that are believed to be key to peacekeeping\'s
success.

Three related issues concerning gender in peacekeeping remain under
studied, and ripe for better data and analysis: (1) sexual abuse and
exploitation (SEA) in peacekeeping, (2) the effects of gender equality
efforts in peacekeeping, and (3) the effects of peacekeeping on sexual
and gender-based violence (SGBV) in civil wars. Since the early 1990s,
women in countries where peacekeepers are deployed have attested that
peacekeepers bring both peace and rape and increased prostitution, and
wish the UN 'had done it better, had been smarter and more thoughtful'
(Whitworth 2004). Nordas and Rustad (2013) offer the first quantitative
study that compares variation in SEA levels by external forces, citing
domestic factors such as low development and high sexual violence in the
conflict as sources of variation. The findings, however, are limited
because the data on SEA committed by external forces remain limited and
poor. Rather than relying on mission reporting, Beber et al. (2017) draw
on a randomized survey sample of Liberian women between the ages of 18
and 30, and find that more than half had engaged in transactional sex,
mainly with UN personnel. The authors estimate that each additional
peacekeeping battalion significantly increases the risk that a woman
will engage in her first transactional sex. Looking more broadly at
human trafficking across countries near peacekeeper deployments, Bell et
al. (2018) demonstrate that deploying more peacekeepers increases the
risk of sex trafficking. In an attempt to offset the problems that
accompany peacekeepers, Karim and Beardsley (2016) argue that the
greater the number of women in peacekeeping, the less SEA committed by
peacekeepers, but they acknowledge that more and better data are needed.
Not all of the news is disheartening. Kirschner and Miller (2019) show
that the higher the number of UN peacekeepers, the less SGBV is
committed during conflict. Johansson and Hultman (2019) report similar
findings, noting that greater numbers of UN police reduce the risk of
sexual violence committed by rebels. Nevertheless, questions remain:
what are the best means of reducing SEA committed by peacekeepers? Which
peacekeepers are most effective at reducing SGBV in civil wars? Does
simply adding more female peacekeepers solve the problems?

The next wave of quantitative studies will almost certainly continue to
embrace more fine-grained data at the mission and local levels to help
policy makers determine where, when and how peacekeepers are having the
most beneficial effect. Disaggregated primary data are now available
through the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, from the Peacekeeping
Operations Location and Event Dataset (PKOLED) developed at the
Department of Government at the University of Essex. New data on
different dimensions of peacekeeping are also increasingly available,
including data on personnel contributions to missions (Kathman 2013),
gender composition (Karim and Beardsley 2016), mission leadership (Bove,
Ruffa and Ruggeri 2019; Bove, Ruggeri and Zwetsloot 2017) and
georeferenced event data on PKOs (Cil et al. 2019; Dorussen and Ruggeri
2017).31 These data will allow scholars to trace the varying effects
that different types of missions have on a wide range of security and
non-security outcomes.

Better Research Designs

There is one glaring gap in our knowledge about peacekeeping: there is
no consensus on why it is so powerful. Quantitative scholars,
qualitative scholars and practitioners offer several different (and
often conflicting) explanations of why peacekeeping is correlated with
peace.

[The next big advance in our understanding of peacekeeping]{.underline}
and peace [will]{.underline} thus likely [come from **carefully designed
policy evaluations**]{.underline}. We believe the best way to do this is
through more evaluation research -- ideally conducted in a policy lab
focused on peacekeeping. Our vision is for a team of scholars to create
the peacekeeping equivalent of the Poverty Lab at MIT, or the
Immigration Policy Lab at Stanford. Such a lab would enable groups of
collaborating scholars to amass primary data on numerous elements of
PKOs in order to determine the causal pathways linking peacekeeping to
peace. [This]{.underline} would not necessarily tell us why peacekeeping
works, but it [would clearly elucidate **what specific policies work**
in **different contexts**]{.underline}.

In an ideal world, a Peacekeeping Policy Lab would be created at a major
research unit and would involve scholars working on the subject from
around the world. Data would be housed centrally and be publicly
available. [Academics are **perfectly situated** to provide this
important evaluative role. Scholars]{.underline} at major universities
around the world [could conduct the **frank** and **realistic
assessments** of what is most effective at promoting a **particular
outcome**]{.underline} without fear of publicizing unpleasant findings
(Gowan 2019).

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are one way to establish that a
causal relationship exists even if they do not tell us how and why it
exists. Peacekeeping troops, for example, might undertake pilot programs
in randomly assigned villages in a given conflict area to allow
researchers to study whether particular types of treatments are more
successful than others at delivering order, stability, rule of law or
peace. These trials could determine the exact effects of different
mandates, force compositions, durations and timings of deployment, as
well as locations, and outcomes.

On many key questions, however, RCTs, will not be feasible. These trials
are difficult to implement, especially in conflict-affected
environments. There are also numerous logistic and bureaucratic
challenges associated with working with (and through) peacekeeping
organizations. Finally, there are serious ethical issues to consider
when offering to send peacekeepers to one village but not another,
especially when there is evidence that peacekeepers save lives.
Researchers will need to grapple with these challenges, which have also
bedeviled RCTs in fields such as economic development. Nevertheless,
when logistical and ethical considerations can be managed, the potential
rewards of such trials could be high.

Meanwhile, additional types of experimental research are emerging that
will help answer questions about the micro-level effects and causal
processes of peacekeeping. Scholars are starting to engage in this
research on their own in the form of randomized surveys (Myukiyehe and
Samii 2012), field experiments and natural experiments. (Di Salvatore
and Ruggeri 2017). Blair (2019), for example, finds in a survey
experiment that exposure to UNMIL increased Liberian citizens\'
willingness to go to state authorities to resolve serious incidents of
crime and violence rather than non-state authorities. He also finds that
exposure to the UN mission increased non-state authorities\' reliance on
legal over illegal mechanisms of dispute resolution. These findings
suggest that UN peacekeeping reduces violence in part by strengthening
the rule of law in participating countries.

Quasi-experimental methods could also help us better understand when and
how peacekeeping works. A working paper by Mvukiyehe and Samii (2018),
for example, presents the results of such an experiment on sets of
communities in post-war Liberia. These communities were similarly likely
to receive peacekeeping bases, but only some actually did. They use
communities' proximity to a base to study the effects of peacekeepers\'
presence. Their study finds that peacekeeping missions did not succeed
by increasing local security, as many theories have surmised, but rather
through mechanisms such as signaling and deterrence.

Lab experiments are another possible route. In a series of laboratory
experiments with ethnic Serbs and Albanians under different third-party
intervention treatments and peacekeeping environments in Kosovo,
Mironova and Whitt (2017) found that third-party enforcement was more
effective at promoting norms of trust between ethnic Serbs and Albanians
than monitoring alone or no intervention at all.

Finally, the UN Security Council likely engages -- unintentionally -- in
numerous natural experiments as it assigns peacekeepers to certain
places and not others, often independently of the expected impacts.
Budget cuts, changes in the composition of the Security Council, and
changes in leadership at the Department of Peace Operations have all led
the UN to adjust missions in ways that are unrelated to events on the
ground. These shifts might allow us to assess, for example, how the
behavior of target populations changed when the mandate was adjusted.
All of these studies are well suited, in complementary ways, to move us
beyond macro-level assessments of the effectiveness of peacekeeping to a
deeper understanding of the causal mechanisms at work.

Conclusion

[Most people **do not realize** that peacekeeping is as successful as it
is]{.underline} -- hence the public relations problem discussed earlier.
[Its negative reputation stems]{.underline} in part [from]{.underline}
media [coverage]{.underline} of UN missions [that tends to **spotlight
failures** and **abuses** rather than **positive results**. Most people
know about the UN\'s fiasco in **Rwanda** but not about its achievements
in **Namibia**]{.underline}. Newspaper [accounts that focus on
**dramatic failures** with **little context** make it easy for the
public to conclude that the world should]{.underline}, perhaps, [invest
**less** in peacekeeping, not **more**]{.underline}.

[The field of peacekeeping]{.underline}, however, [is blessed with a
**mass of high-quality empirical studies** that reveal just how
**critical** peacekeeping is to peace. Almost every large-n study finds
a **strong**, **statistically significant relationship** between
peacekeeping and reduced bloodshed. These studies make it clear that
**without** peacekeeping, we would see **more violence** around the
world and **costlier types of intervention** would be
necessary]{.underline}. A 2018 General Accounting Report commissioned by
the US Congress found that a unilateral US deployment to the Central
African Republic would cost 'almost 8 times' more than what the United
States contributes to the current UN mission (Government Accounting
Office 2018). UN peacekeeping is not only necessary to reduce and
prevent violence; it is also a cost-effective way to do so.

[We all know that the UN is slow to make decisions, often
inefficient]{.underline} in its implementation, hamstrung by red tape,
[and vulnerable to corruption and scandal. These
inefficiencies]{.underline}, however, [reveal **just how much more** the
UN could do if it were **properly resourced** and
**organized**]{.underline}. Hegre, Hultman and Nygard (2019), for
example, estimated that the UN could have significantly reduced the
violence in an additional four to five major conflicts between 2001 and
2013 if the international community had been willing to spend more on
peacekeeping and provide existing missions with stronger mandates. [Less
peacekeeping **will not make the world safer**. It will only
**facilitate more violence**]{.underline}.

In his first address to the United Nations Security Council in January
2017, the new Secretary-General António Guterres stated: "We spend far
more time and resources responding to crises rather than preventing
them. People are paying too high a price." He stressed that a "whole new
approach" to conflict prevention is necessary. Indeed, the world is
paying a steep price for violent conflict. The United Nations' 2018
appeal for humanitarian aid funding was record-setting: \$22.5 billion
to provide aid to 91 million people. Most need is preventable and caused
by conflict. [In 2015, the number of conflicts and fatalities spiked and
has remained high]{.underline}, to levels unprecedented since the end of
the Cold War. Terrorist attacks and their toll have followed a similar
trend, peaking in 2014. Externalities are piling up. Forced displacement
of civilians is at its highest since the U.N. began keeping track, and
recipient and neighboring countries have experienced political
destabilization even when the levels of migration have been moderate.
Meanwhile, [there has been a revival of proxy warfare and threats of
interstate war, in addition to increasing difficulties in resolving
large, ongoing wars]{.underline}. The United States, Russia, and China
have been at odds in the U.N. Security Council (UNSC), reducing the
efficacy of multilateral peace initiatives. [Renewed]{.underline}
thinking and [[focus on conflict prevention is urgent]{.mark}, as it is
far more effective]{.underline} and less expensive [to prevent conflict
than respond to it]{.underline}. How can conflict prevention be applied
in Myanmar, Venezuela, and North Korea today? DOES IT WORK? The primary
short- or medium-term tools for preventing imminent war are economic
sanctions, preventive diplomacy, and---in very rare cases---preventive
deployments of military force. Sanctions, for instance, are credited
with contributing to South Africa's ending of apartheid or Myanmar's
recent democratic opening. [[Multilateral]{.mark} diplomatic
[initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as the U.N.'s Mediation Support
Unit, [[have been effective]{.mark} in preventing conflict]{.underline}.
In Macedonia between 1992 and 1999, the United Nations' preventive
deployment of peacekeepers helped that country avoid the wars of its
former Yugoslav neighbors. [[Long-term prevention]{.mark} measures have
also [had remarkable impacts]{.mark}, though it can be hard to measure
success]{.underline}. For instance, [economic development
[address]{.mark}es [a common root cause of many]{.mark} civil
[wars]{.mark}. Global [reductions in]{.mark} absolute [poverty have been
dramatic]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the U.N.'s Sustainable Development
Goals explicitly link further efforts to conflict prevention.
[[Transnational, systemic conflict prevention has been very
successful]{.mark}, including non-proliferation regimes around nuclear,
chemical, biological weapons, small arms and light weapons; or efforts
to combat conflict diamonds and minerals]{.underline} such as the
Kimberley Process or section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act. [Successful
conflict prevention [requires]{.mark} robust international,
[multilateral commitments]{.mark}. Individual states, guided by
self-interest, are unlikely to prioritize conflict
prevention]{.underline}. There are few political rewards for success.
[[Good conflict prevention is invisible, because violence does not
occur]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, there may be political costs to
engaging in talks or imposing sanctions. [Multilateral approaches to
conflict prevention activities can alter states' incentives for getting
involved in conflict prevention. Further, effective diplomacy,
sanctions, or other prevention policies require coordinated, committed
action]{.underline}. [[2017]{.mark} has been a year [marked by]{.mark}
dramatic [failures]{.mark} in conflict prevention,
including]{.underline} namely the [ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya
minority in Myanmar]{.underline}; the economic, humanitarian, and
political crises in Venezuela; and the degradation of diplomacy in
managing North Korea. [These failures demonstrate the difficulties of
preventing conflict given an international system under
stress]{.underline}. MYANMAR Since August 25, roughly 626,000 Rohingya
(of a population of just over a million) have fled from Rakhine state to
neighboring Bangladesh; tens of thousands are internally displaced. An
unknown number have been killed within Rakhine. First-hand accounts of
the violence include descriptions of widespread rape, arson, shelling,
and killings. The United States, among many others, has identified this
as ethnic cleansing. The U.N. has begun to speak of genocide. This
violence was widely predicted. Governments, civil society, and the
United Nations issued repeated warnings over several years. As recently
as March 2016, the U.S. Atrocities Prevention Board detailed the
vulnerability and targeting of the Rohingyas, describing violations of
human rights and several surges of violence. The international community
had sufficient advance information on the risks of state-sponsored
violence against the Rohingya but failed to organize adequate preventive
action. Complicating international response to the violence is the
concern over disrupting Myanmar's democratic transition and the fact
that the civilian government, elected in 2015, has no control over the
armed forces, while the military remains in a position to reverse
reform. The ethnic cleansing of the Rohingyas is a failure of the
international norm of the "Responsibility to Protect" (R2P). R2P
establishes the responsibility of states to protect civilians from
genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.
Mandates under R2P are established with a UNSC resolution, increasingly
difficult to pass in a world of resurgent realpolitik. In November,
China and Russia prevented the UNSC from passing a resolution condemning
the violence against the Rohingya. The UNSC passed a non-binding
presidential statement instead. This is the latest in a series of
failures of the norm, including failures to protect civilians in Darfur,
Syria, or the Yazidis in Iraq. Equally damaging may be the perception
that R2P was invoked in Libya as a Trojan Horse for regime change.
November's UNSC presidential statement on Myanmar may have done less to
make its government reconsider its actions against the Rohingya and more
to demonstrate that the UNSC would not adopt stronger measures to stop
the violence. VENEZUELA Once the richest country in Latin America,
Venezuela suffered extreme fragility this year, if not state failure.
Potential for civil war or coup is strong. Suffering debt default and
hyperinflation, hunger and malnutrition, shortages of medicine, and
violent political unrest, Venezuela's economic crisis has become a
humanitarian crisis. Acute child malnutrition rose precipitously. The
average Venezuelan lost roughly 20 pounds this year due to food
shortages. Infant mortality rose 35 percent; maternal mortality rose 65
percent. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans sought refuge in Brazil,
Colombia, and Peru, while Panama has closed its borders. State
institutions are in disarray. On March 29, the Supreme Court stripped
the powers of the opposition-majority National Assembly. Three months of
daily street protests followed, in which over 120 people were killed.
President Nicolás Maduro's response to demands for humanitarian aid and
fresh elections was to hold elections for a Constituent Assembly at the
end of July. The new body, full of Maduro loyalists, has supplanted the
powers of the National Assembly. Russia has undermined regional
governments' efforts to coordinate a multilateral response aimed at
isolating the Maduro regime. The Lima Group, composed of 12 American
states, has been organizing multilateral sanctions and making joint
statements. The European Union has imposed an arms embargo. However,
last month, Russia provided a debt-restructuring package. In November,
Russia and China boycotted a UNSC meeting on Venezuela, ruling out
Security Council action. The roots of Venezuela's crisis were echoed in
political violence and instability around the world in 2017.
Institutional and electoral manipulation has destabilized several
countries this year. Examples include Kenya's disrupted and
delegitimized election and its attendant violence and Liberia's
interrupted elections. Honduras is in the grips of a violent response to
what looks like electoral manipulation. Guatemala's president failed in
a bid to dismantle an anti-corruption institution but Congress has since
re-affirmed his immunity from prosecution. Spain and Iraq suffered
violence and a degradation of democratic governance in the face of
secessionist referendums. Doubt has been cast on the impact and quality
of electoral observation, the key tool for avoiding electoral violence.
NORTH KOREA While diplomacy, sanctions, and targeted engagement have
been successful in preventing conflict on the Korean peninsula for
decades, 2017 marks decisive failures in terms of North Korea's (or the
DPRK) nuclear capacities. In September, North Korea tested an "advanced
nuclear devise." The explosive yield of this sixth North Korean nuclear
weapons test was larger than the other five test-yields combined. On 29
November, the DPRK conducted a test of its most powerful missile.
Experts estimate that the entire United States is, or will soon be,
within range of intercontinental ballistic missiles which might carry
nuclear weapons. In parallel, the United States and the DPRK have
engaged in bellicose rhetorical brinksmanship, making war between the
two states seem increasingly likely. This month, both sides have issued
warnings that war is closer than it has ever been since the 1953
armistice. Public acceptance of the possibility of conflict within the
United States has ballooned. Mechanisms to head off escalation caused by
misunderstandings do not exist. The most effective channel of
communication between Washington and Pyongyang may be Dennis Rodman.
North Korea's demonstration of advanced nuclear capability this year is
a failure of the most successful systemic global conflict prevention of
the post-WWII world order: disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation.
North Korea acquired its nuclear technology through the A. Q. Khan
network, and the DPRK now poses a similar risk of further illicit
proliferation. Trump has been impatient with multilateral, diplomatic
containment of nuclear proliferation. In October, the president declined
to re-certify the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the
multilateral agreement on Iran's nuclear program. This repudiation of
the Iran agreement limits the credibility of any talks on North Korea
that might trade U.S. incentives or sanctions relief for a DPRK freeze
on weapons testing or development. BACK TO THE FUTURE? These three cases
[[highlight the]{.mark} inadequacy and [indispensability of conflict
prevention]{.mark}]{.underline}. These were lost opportunities for
conflict prevention. Myanmar was widely predicted but not prevented.
Venezuela and North Korea could be pulled back from the brink of civil
or inter-state war, but suffered severely degraded conditions this year.
The [cases share failures to coordinate among the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [China, and Russia]{.underline}. In Myanmar, China
shielded a protégé regime from intervention. In Venezuela, Russia has
undermined multilateral sanctions and blocked UNSC action. North Korea
[[demonstrates the]{.mark} profound [damage to international peace that
results in]{.mark} the [U.S. rejection of
multilateralism]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The sharp rise in war and
violence is straining states and international organizations, and
conflict prevention is more difficult now]{.underline}, perhaps, than it
has been since it became a United Nations priority in the early 1990s.
Given the requirement of unanimity at the Security Council and discord
among the permanent members, the UNSC will likely continue to hinder
prevention efforts. [New [coordinating mechanisms for conflict
prevention are necessary]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Despite systemic
conditions that make]{.mark} conflict [prevention
difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}, Secretary-General Guterres is [[right to
prioritize]{.mark} conflict prevention. [Increased risks of]{.mark}
inter-state war, including [nuclear war]{.mark}, overlaid with
de-stabilizing civil conflicts in multiple regions, [make conflict
prevention an]{.mark} increasingly [existential
imperative]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Multilateral efforts to coordinate
sanctions, arms embargoes, diplomacy, or implement stronger measures in
response to mass atrocities need to be prioritized and
incentivized]{.underline}. This is work that the secretary general can
pursue within or aside from the Security Council. Ad-hoc organization,
such as through the Lima Group, or the group of six countries
coordinating diplomacy on North Korea, is a likely avenue forward.

### Framing Cards---2NC

#### None of their offense is unique---LAW prolif is [inevitable]{.underline} and all the risks apply [equally]{.underline} to humans---but, future development encourages [exhaustive testing]{.underline} which [solves all risks]{.underline}

**Ackerman, 15**---senior writer for IEEE Spectrum's award-winning
robotics blog, Automaton (Evan, "We Should Not Ban 'Killer Robots,' and
Here's Why,"
<https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/artificial-intelligence/we-should-not-ban-killer-robots>,
dml)

The problem with this argument is that **[no]{.underline}** letter,
[**UN declaration**, or even a **formal ban** ratified by multiple
nations is **going to prevent people** from being able to build
autonomous, weaponized robots. The barriers keeping people from
developing this kind of system are **just too low**]{.underline}.
Consider the "armed quadcopters." Today you can buy a
smartphone-controlled quadrotor for US \$300 at Toys R Us. Just imagine
what you'll be able to buy tomorrow. [This technology **exists**. It's
**improving all the time**. There's simply **too much commercial value**
in creating]{.underline} quadcopters (and other robots) that have longer
endurance, more autonomy, bigger payloads, and [everything]{.underline}
else [that you'd also want in a military system]{.underline}. And at
this point, it's entirely possible that small commercial quadcopters are
just as advanced as (and way cheaper than) small military quadcopters,
anyway. [We're **not going to stop that research**, though, because
everybody wants delivery drones (among other things)]{.underline}.
Generally speaking, technology itself is not inherently good or bad:
it's what we choose to do with it that's good or bad, and you can't just
cover your eyes and start screaming "STOP!!!" if you see something
sinister on the horizon when there's so much simultaneous potential for
positive progress.

What [we really need]{.underline}, then, is [a way of making autonomous
armed robots **ethical**, because we're **not going to be able to
prevent them from existing**]{.underline}. In fact, [the most
significant assumption]{.underline} that this letter makes [is that
armed autonomous robots are **inherently more likely to cause unintended
destruction** and **death** than armed autonomous humans are. This may
or may not be the case right now, and either way]{.underline}, I
genuinely believe that [it **won't be the case** in the future, perhaps
the **very near future**]{.underline}. I think that [it will be possible
for robots to be **as good** (or **better**) at identifying hostile
enemy combatants as humans, since there are rules that can be
followed]{.underline} (called Rules of Engagement, for an example see
page 27 of this) [to determine whether or not using force is
justified]{.underline}. For example, does your target have a weapon? Is
that weapon pointed at you? Has the weapon been fired? Have you been
hit? [These are all things that a robot can determine using any number
of sensors that currently exist]{.underline}.

It's worth noting that Rules of Engagement generally allow for
engagement in the event of an imminent attack. In other words, if a
hostile target has a weapon and that weapon is pointed at you, you can
engage before the weapon is fired rather than after in the interests of
self-protection. [Robots could be **even more cautious**]{.underline}
than this: [you could **program them to not engage a hostile target with
deadly force** unless they confirm with whatever level of certainty that
you want that the target is actively engaging them already]{.underline}.
Since robots aren't alive and don't have emotions and don't get tired or
stressed or distracted, [it's possible for them to **just sit there**,
**under fire**, until **all necessary criteria for engagement** are met.
Humans **can't do this**]{.underline}.

[The argument against this is that a robot autonomously making a
decision to engage a target with deadly force]{.underline}, no matter
how certain the robot may be, [is **dangerous** and
**unethical**]{.underline}. It is dangerous, and it may be unethical, as
well. [However, is it **any more dangerous** or **unethical than asking
a human to do the same thing**?]{.underline} The real question that we
should be asking is this: [Could autonomous armed robots **perform
better** than armed humans in combat, resulting in **fewer
casualties**]{.underline} (combatant or non-combatant) [on both
sides?]{.underline} I believe so, which doesn't really matter, but so do
people who are actually working on this stuff, which does.

In 2009, Ronald C. Arkin, Patrick Ulam, and Brittany Duncan published a
paper entitled "An Ethical Governor for Constraining Lethal Action in an
Autonomous System," which was about how to program an armed, autonomous
robot to act within the Laws of War and Rules of Engagement. h+ Magazine
interviewed Arkin on the subject (read the whole thing here), and here's
what he said:

h+: Some researchers assert that no robots or AI systems will be able to
discriminate between a combatant and an innocent, that this sensing
ability currently just does not exist. Do you think this is just a
short-term technology limitation? What such technological assumptions do
you make in the design of your ethical governor?

RA: I agree this discrimination technology does not effectively exist
today, nor is it intended that these systems should be fielded in
current conflicts. These are for the so-called war after next, and the
DoD would need to conduct extensive additional research in order to
develop the accompanying technology to support the proof-of-concept work
I have developed. But [I **don't believe there is any fundamental
scientific limitation** to achieving the goal of these machines being
able to **discriminate better than humans can** in the fog of
war]{.underline}, again in tightly specified situations. This is the
benchmark that I use, rather than perfection. But if [that]{.underline}
standard is achieved, it [can **succeed** in reducing noncombatant
casualties]{.underline} and thus is a goal worth pursuing in my
estimation.

One way to [think about this]{.underline} is [like autonomous cars.
Expecting an autonomous car to keep you safe 100 percent of the time is
**unrealistic**. But, if an autonomous car is]{.underline} (say) [**5
percent more likely** to keep you safe than if you were driving
yourself, you'd still be **much better off** letting it take over.
Autonomous cars]{.underline}, by the way, [will likely be **much safer**
than that, and]{.underline} it's entirely possible that [**autonomous
armed robots will be**, **too**]{.underline}. And if autonomous armed
robots really do have at least the potential reduce casualties, aren't
we then ethically obligated to develop them?

[If there are **any doubts** about how effective or ethical these
systems might be, just **test them exhaustively**. **Deploy them**,
**load them up with blanks**, and **watch how they do**]{.underline}.
Will they screw up sometimes? Of course they will, both during testing
and after. But setting aside the point above about relative
effectiveness, [the **big advantage** of robots is that their behavior
is **traceable** and they **learn programmatically**: if one robot does
something wrong, it's possible to **trace the chain of decisions** that
it made]{.underline} (decisions programmed into it by a human, by the
way) [to find out what happened. Once the error is located, it can be
**resolved**, and you can be **confident** that the robot **will not
make that same mistake again**. Furthermore, you can **update every
other robot at the same time**. This is **not something we can do with
humans**]{.underline}.

I do agree that [there is a potential risk with autonomous weapons of
making it **easier to decide to use force**. But, that's been true
**ever since someone realized that they could throw a rock at someone
else** instead of **walking up** and **punching them**. There's been
**continual development** of technologies that allow us to engage our
enemies while minimizing our own risk]{.underline}, and what with the
ballistic and cruise missiles that we've had for the last half century,
we've got that pretty well figured out. [If you want to argue that
autonomous drones or armed ground robots will lower the bar even
farther, then okay, but it's a **pretty low bar** as is.
And]{.underline} fundamentally, [you're then placing the blame on
**technology**, **not the people**]{.underline} deciding how to use the
technology.

And that's the point that I keep coming back to on this: [blaming
technology for the decisions that we make involving it is]{.underline}
at best **[counterproductive]{.underline}** and at worst nonsensical.
[**Any technology** can be used for evil, and many technologies that
were developed to kill people are now responsible for **some of our
greatest achievements**]{.underline}, from harnessing nuclear power to
riding a ballistic missile into space. If you want to make the argument
that this is really about the decision to use the technology, not the
technology itself, then that's awesome. I'm totally with you. But
[banning the technology is **not going to solve the problem** if the
problem is the **willingness of humans** to use technology for
evil]{.underline}: we'd need a much bigger petition for that.

#### Status quo development will be [incremental]{.underline} and [safe]{.underline}

**Toscano, 15**---Navy Judge Advocate and 2014 LLM Graduate of the
George Washington University Law School (Christopher, "Friend of Humans:
An Argument for Developing Autonomous Weapons Systems," 8 J. Nat\'l Sec.
L. & Pol\'y 189 (2015), dml)

[Over the next several decades, AWS development will **likely
continue**, given the **large-scale investment in research** by the
United States and other countries]{.underline}. As suggested by authors
like Singer, Anderson, and Waxman, [the employment of fully functional
AWSs will be a **gradual** or **incremental approach** over
time]{.underline}. 16 [Current technologies will **continually evolve**,
and with each progressive step, humans will **slowly be removed** from
the loop]{.underline}.4 17 [**Unlike beliefs grounded in fiction**,
governments **will not push a button unleashing an autonomous army**
tantamount to a \"March of the Wooden Soldiers\" approach at a given
moment]{.underline}. 4 18 As stated earlier, [the idea that AWS armies
will **fully replace humans** or **engage in bloodless wars** is
**implausible**, if for no other reasons than **humanity\'s aggressive
nature** or an **innate distrust of robots**]{.underline}.4 1 9

In light of present limitations on technology (such as Al) and
persistent criticisms over legality, technology [companies will
**continue to research transitional technologies**, such as robot-based
devices that enhance human performance]{.underline} (e.g., Human
Assisted Neural Devices). 420 For example, such companies will pursue
man-machine \"symbiotic systems,\" such as suits designed for pilots
that let them \"feel\" parts of the plane. In this example, these
systems will enable human pilots to feel vibration, heat, or heaviness
in their corresponding arm if there is an overload in the plane\'s
wing.421 Other examples include an exoskeleton program, where
Raytheon\'s XOS2 Exoskeleton Robotics Suit allows human operators to
carry heavier payloads or punch through heavy obstacles.422 Weaponizing
and employing armor on such devices is not far-fetched.

[Over time, **incremental employment** of AWSs will involve humans being
**supported by fully autonomous systems** in logistical
settings]{.underline}. Military personnel will work side-by-side with
drones that will enhance lift capabilities no differently from manned
machines. For example, DARPA has developed an \"autonomous pack horse\"
known as the Legged Squad Support System, or BigDog.423 This autonomous
quadruped can carry 400 pounds of military gear travelling at 7-8 miles
per hour and is capable of quieter modes and voice recognition. More
advanced versions include a strong arm capable of throwing cinder blocks
across great distances.425 Carrying wounded soldiers out of combat
appears plausible.4 2 6 DARPA\'s next generation robot, known as the
WildCat, is being developed with the capability to run at speeds up to
50 miles per hour on all types of terrain.4 27 Such capabilities could
enable faster resupply operations to troops in combat. Other possible
enhancing options for similar platforms could involve smaller-scale
versions capable of bomb or narcotics detection analogous to a military
working dog. More aggressive versions could involve a weaponized
quadruped robot.

Lastly, [employing fully autonomous weapons systems working without
human counterparts will be a **gradual incremental step**, once the
technology and Al have **fully matured**. **Technological advancement**
and **field testing alone support this conclusion**]{.underline}.
However, given criticisms and DoD\'s own hesitancy to enable these
lethal systems in fully autonomous modes, [initial platforms will be
**more defensive** in nature]{.underline}, resembling measures such as
more advanced ballistic missile defense systems, perimeter security
drones or anti-UAV robotics similar to a former DARPA program called
Peregrine.4 28 [Once these defensive capabilities **establish
reliability** in preventing unnecessary loss of life or destruction,
technological advancements will **eventually graduate to fully
autonomous offensive measures** over time]{.underline}. However, in the
near term, defensive and offensive AWSs will likely require that human
operators approve any decision to use lethal force to avoid the dilemmas
posed by critics.4 29 Moreover, employing AWSs to intercept missiles,
drones, or similar unmanned devices is a logical progression.

#### Constraining LAWs development creates [backlash]{.underline} and [won't deter the worst actors]{.underline}---only the [fear of reciprocity]{.underline} solves restraint 

**Scharre, 18**---Senior Fellow and Director of the 20YY Warfare
Initiative at the Center for a New American Security (Paul, "Are
Autonomous Weapons Inevitable?," *Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and
the Future of War*, Chapter 21, pg 350-351, dml)

This sets up a situation where [**NGOs** and **smaller states** who are
advocating for a ban would **asymmetrically benefit**]{.underline}, at
least in the near term, [and **would not be giving up anything**. This
**only generates resistance** from states who are leaders in military
robotics, many of whom see their technology development proceeding in an
**entirely reasonable** and **prudent fashion**. The **more that others
want to take them away**, the **more that autonomous weapons look
appealing** to the countries that might build them]{.underline}.

This is particularly the case when ban [supporters have **no answer**
for how law-abiding nations could **defend themselves** against those
who **do develop fully autonomous weapons**]{.underline}. Steve Goose
acknowledged this problem: "You know you're not going to get every
country in the world to sign something immediately, but you can get
people to be affected by the stigma that would accompany a comprehensive
prohibition," he said. "You have to create this [stigma]{.underline}
that you don't cross the line." This [can be a **powerful tool** in
encouraging restraint, but it **isn't foolproof**. There is a **strong
stigma against chemical weapons**, but they **continue to be used by
dictators** who care nothing for the rule of law or the suffering of
civilians.]{.underline} Thus, for many the case against [a
ban]{.underline} is simple: it [would disarm **only the law-abiding
states who signed it**. This would be the **worst of all possible
outcomes**, **empowering the world's most odious regimes with
potentially dangerous weapons**, while leaving nations who care about
international law at a **disadvantage**]{.underline}. Proponents of a
ban have yet to articulate a strategic rationale for why it would be in
a leading military power's self-interest to support a ban.

Though they haven't always succeeded in the past, great powers have
worked together to avoid weapons that could cause excessive harm. This
time, however, leading military powers aren't trying, in part because
the issue has been framed as a humanitarian one, not a strategic one. In
CCW discussions, countries have heard expert views on the Martens
Clause, which has never been used to ban a weapon before, but strategic
considerations have gotten short shrift. A few experts have presented on
offense-defense balance and arms races, but there has been virtually no
discussion of how autonomous weapons might complicate crisis stability,
escalation control, and war termination. John Borrie from the UN
Institute for Disarmament Research is concerned about the risk of
"unintended lethal effects" from autonomous weapons, but he
acknowledged, "it's not really a significant feature of the policy
debate in the CCW." This is unfortunate, because autonomous weapons
raise important issues for stability. There may be military benefits to
using fully autonomous weapons, but it would be facile and wrong to
suggest that overall they are safer and more humane than semiautonomous
weapons that retain a human in the loop. This argument conflates the
benefits of adding automation, which are significant, with completely
removing the human from the loop. There may be cases where their use
would result in more-humane outcomes, provided they functioned properly,
such as hostage rescue in communications-denied environments or
destroying mobile missiles launchers armed with WMD. On the whole,
though, the net effects of introducing fully autonomous weapons on the
battlefield are likely to be increased speed, greater consequences when
accidents occur, and reduced human control.

[States have **every incentive to cooperate** to avoid a world where
they have **less control** over the use of force. **Mutual restraint**
is definitely in states' interests. This is **especially true for great
powers**, given the **destruction** that war among them would bring.
Restraint **doesn't come from a treaty**, though. The **fear of
reciprocity is what generates restraint**]{.underline}. A treaty is
merely a focal point for coordination. Is restraint possible? History
suggests any attempt to restrain autonomous weapons must meet three
essential conditions to succeed.

### AT: Accidents

[Efforts to show that drones are objectionable because of their
propensity to suffer from technical faults make the same mistake as
those that are too heavily based on evidence drawn from drones' use in
the War on Terror.]{.underline} That is to say, these [objections appeal
to characteristics of a particular type of drone at a particular moment
in time]{.underline}, even though these characteristics are probably
transient. It is possible for those who produce and use drones to be
guilty of negligence if they deploy machines that have been inadequately
tested or that have known technical faults. Identifying negligence is
particularly important if the faults make drones susceptible to capture
by enemies or to attacking civilians. Nevertheless, [claims of
negligence can only be fairly directed against specific devices that
have technical faults and not at drones as a class of
technology]{.underline}. We [might reasonably blame the manufacturers of
a new type of drone for a faulty targeting system that leads to a
mistaken attack on civilians, but such an incident would not demonstrate
any fundamental flaw in drones that should lead to their prohibition as
a class of machines.]{.underline} When it comes to American UAVs, there
may be grounds for arguing that developers and military leaders were
negligent in taking inadequate safety precautions, but the fault for
this would lie with specific people and the faulty UAVs they employed,
not with UAVs as such.

When it is framed as a general objection against drones, [criticism of
drones' technological limitations depends far too much on a momentary
lack of sophistication that is typical of new weapons and weapons
platforms entering military service for the first time]{.underline}. The
early tanks deployed on the Western Front during the First World War
fell victim to mechanical faults in astronomical numbers. 4 Some early
fighter planes were armed with machine guns that were mounted above the
plane's propeller, but pilots risked shooting themselves down if poorly
synchronized bullets broke the propeller or ricocheted back at the
pilot. 5 [Even rifles can be faulty, as evidenced by the first version
of the American M16, which was prone to jamming when it was first
released during the Vietnam War.]{.underline} 6 In some instances, these
mechanical problems caused deaths and injuries, but [it would be
inaccurate to say that there is something inherently wrong with tanks,
aircraft, or rifles based on these initial faults]{.underline}. The same
is true of drones, especially when they are at this nascent stage.

#### Neg warrant---provides an off-ramp for de-escalation

**Leys, 18**---JD Candidate, Yale Law School (Nathan, "Autonomous Weapon
Systems and International Crises," Strategic Studies Quarterly, Spring
2018, dml)

In this case, the United States would prefer not to launch military
action against Russia. Regardless of the veracity of Russia's claim of
an accidental firing, the United States could call for a diplomatic
resolution short of kinetic force (e.g. international inspections of the
system, a withdrawal of air defense batteries in the area, etc.).
[Autonomy could afford the United States an **off-ramp** by providing a
**plausible cover**: the **potentially accidental nature** of the
violation of an ally's sovereignty means a military response is neither
**legally required** nor **morally warranted**]{.underline}.

In short, [AWS could provide a **face-saving alternative** for leaders
trying to **de-escalate a crisis**. The technical complexities of
AI-enabled weapons and the possibility of malfunction **add a new
layer** of fog to war. It **may not be possible**]{.underline} in such
situations [to determine **whether an AWS malfunctioned** or a **redline
was crossed**---more importantly, it **may not matter**. AWS operating
in conditions of uncertainty make it possible for a first shot to be
fired, even if no person fires it. In an interesting twist on the debate
about whom to hold responsible in the event of an AWS's malfunction, the
most life-saving answer]{.underline} in a crisis [may be **no one**: If
there is **no one to blame**, there is **no one to
bomb**]{.underline}.63 On the other hand, national leaders may well hold
the owners of the AWS system responsible regardless whether an attack
was accidental. In this case, retaliation might seem desirable to
maintain credibility.

### AT: Accountability

#### Accountability is possible even if humans don't control every decision

**Toscano, 15**---Navy Judge Advocate and 2014 LLM Graduate of the
George Washington University Law School (Christopher, "Friend of Humans:

First, [some]{.underline} critics [argue that AWSs raise
**accountability concerns**]{.underline} over LOAC violations.
Specifically, they argue about who should be held accountable in the
event that an autonomous weapon causes civilian deaths. Philosopher
Robert Sparrow (cited in the HRW report), argues that no one, including
the machine as a sentient being, can \"justly be held responsible for
the actions of these systems, \[and thus\] it will be unethical to use
them in war., 25 6 By his logic, [**many weapons currently considered
lawful would be illegal** if a human being isn\'t **controlling every
aspect** of their use]{.underline}. Sparrow fails to acknowledge that
[AWSs always remain a weapons system that the **commander ordered into
action** and for which the commander **remains ultimately
responsible**]{.underline}. 7 Sparrow\'s argument fails to recognize
that [humans will **develop**, **test**, **deploy**, and **maintain
oversight** for AWSs. Deficiencies in AWSs **resulting from human
error** in design, manufacturing, and employment will **dictate
responsibility analogous to tort** or **criminal liability theory**, as
is **done currently with non-AWSs**]{.underline}.258 As will be
discussed more thoroughly in Part VI, this article proposes that
[command responsibility in the AWS realm will **actually improve** by
using current accountability notions]{.underline}.

\*Note: This Leys card is also in AT: Accidents

### AT: AI Goes Rogue

#### This assumes robots act like humans, which is the [whole damn point]{.underline}---testing and programming solves---they don't assume [future]{.underline} tech

**Toscano, 15**---Navy Judge Advocate and 2014 LLM Graduate of the
George Washington University Law School (Christopher, "Friend of Humans:
An Argument for Developing Autonomous Weapons Systems," 8 J. Nat\'l Sec.
L. & Pol\'y 189 (2015), dml)

[Critics]{.underline} like Sparrow also [contend that AWSs may \"**go
rogue**,\" killing innocent civilians \"to **strike fear** into the
hearts of onlooking combatants]{.underline} \... [to **test its weapon
systems**, or because the robot was seeking to **revenge the \'deaths\'
of robot comrades**. \'\'259]{.underline} Sparrow attempts to analogize
or promote the comparative notion of future AWS autonomy to human
autonomy in a metaphorical or philosophical sense, thus [**conflating**
two separate understandings]{.underline}. He [assumes that AWSs will
**make their own independent choices the way humans do** and will
therefore be **unpredictable**]{.underline}. 260 His [argument is
**fatally flawed**]{.underline} for several reasons. First, he [accepts
**current technological notions** as **predictive of future
outcomes**]{.underline}. Sparrow [accepts selected Al research as
**dispositive on how all AWSs will perform in the future**]{.underline}.
261 Next, his [argument assumes that developers will **program AWSs with
humanity\'s flaws**]{.underline}.262 Further, he [**ignores the
requirement** that military and political leaders will **demand
programmed IHL** and **ROE constraints** within the systems\' Al
architecture]{.underline}, as discussed earlier. [While fully autonomous
weapons will act without further input from their human counterparts,
**nothing suggests** humanity will enable a fully autonomous/adaptive
mode **without the baseline restriction** of \"**do no harm**\" to
civilians]{.underline} as Arkin suggests.26 3 Lastly, his [argument
**dismisses the extensive AWS testing** to safeguard against mishaps
that will occur **before any AWSs would be employed**]{.underline}.

### AT: Ambiguity/Escalation

#### This is backwards---unpredictable LAWs [improve stability]{.underline} and [prevent escalation]{.underline}

**Scharre, 18**---Senior Fellow and Director of the 20YY Warfare
Initiative at the Center for a New American Security (Paul, "Playing
With Fire: Autonomous Weapons and Stability," *Army of None: Autonomous
Weapons and the Future of War*, Chapter 18, pg 314-315, dml)

This suggests [another way autonomous weapons might **improve
stability**: the "**mad robot theory**." If countries perceive
autonomous weapons as **dangerous**, as introducing an **unpredictable
element** into a crisis that **cannot be completely controlled**, then
introducing them into a crisis might **induce caution**]{.underline}. It
would be the equivalent of what Thomas Schelling has described as "the
threat that leaves something to chance." [By deploying autonomous
weapons into a tense environment, a country would effectively be saying
to the enemy, "Things are now out of my hands. Circumstances **may lead
to war**; they **may not**. I **cannot control it**, and your **only
course of action** if you wish to **avoid war** is to **back down**."
Unlike the problem of **credibly tying one's hands** by locking in
**escalatory rules of engagement**, this threat **does not require
convincing the enemy** what the autonomous weapons' rules of engagement
are]{.underline}. In fact, [**uncertainty** makes the "mad robot" threat
**more credible**, since deterrence **hinges** on the robot's
**unpredictability**, rather than the **certainty of its actions**.
Deploying an **untested** and **unverified autonomous weapon** would be
**even more of a deterrent**, since one could **convincingly say** that
its behavior was **truly unpredictable**]{.underline}.

### AT: Asymmetry

#### Critiques of asymmetric drone warfare are wrong -- 6 reasons!

Despite the efforts that critics have made [to show that there is
something inherently wrong with asymmetric warfare, their arguments
suffer from at least six serious problems.]{.underline} First[, it is
misleading to suggest that wars involving drones are inherently
asymmetric.]{.underline} This [comes back to the point I made earlier
about mistaking the use of drones by the USA in the War on Terror for
inherent characteristics of drone warfare]{.underline}. It is easy to
imagine that [future confl icts involving drones could be waged between
opponents that both have drones or between drone users and opponents
that have effective countermeasures]{.underline}, such as the ability to
hack into the machines. It is also possible that drones will be
ineffective in certain types of wars. Recall that one of the concerns
that critics have raised is that drones are not effective weapons in
counterinsurgency operations and that belligerents using them may
undermine their own chances of victory. If [this critique is accurate,
then we have good reason to doubt that even asymmetric possession of
drones will make a war's outcome a foregone conclusion.]{.underline}

Second, [critics who raise the asymmetry objection are mistaken in
thinking that war must be a fair and equal contest]{.underline}.
[Neither just war theory nor international humanitarian law rests on
this assumption. Asymmetry will sometimes be morally undesirable, such
as when a powerful state acts aggressively toward a weak opponent, and
it will sometimes be desirable]{.underline}, such as when a powerful
state helps to protect a weak state against aggression. [There is no a
priori way of knowing whether symmetry or asymmetry between belligerents
will promote just or unjust outcomes, and therefore, no reason to think
that symmetry or asymmetry should be morally desirable or undesirable as
a general rule]{.underline}.

Third, [the moral justifi cation for killing in war does not require
reciprocal risk between combatants]{.underline}, as Kahn claims, [nor
does it require that we treat just and unjust belligerents as being akin
to police offi cers and criminals]{.underline}, respectively, as
Strawser does. I agree with Walzer and others who think that [we should
avoid demonizing soldiers who fi ght on behalf of unjust
causes]{.underline}. 67 The rights of combatants should be respected,
regardless of which side they support. Nevertheless, if combatants'
rights and responsibilities are identical, they do not rest on soldiers
posing a reciprocal threat to each other, as Kahn maintains. [Soldiers
are liable to attack during war because they are members of armed groups
that intend to attack each other; they are part of an established social
convention that joins opponents in relations of enmity. This makes
combatants liable to attack]{.underline} until they choose to end that
enmity through surrender or a negotiated settlement. This is part of the
collective character of war. As Collins correctly notes, '\[i\][t is
social organizations, rather than physical bodies and physical
equipment, that is the object of the maneuverings of combat. Armies fi
ght, not in order to kill soldiers, incapacitate weapons, and take
ground, but to destroy the ability to resist]{.underline}.' 68

It [is legal, and morally justifi able according to virtually all
accounts of just war, to attack soldiers who are sleeping or
unarmed]{.underline} (e.g., those who transport supplies, drive
vehicles, or help to operate crew-served weapons). This is [why it is
possible to launch surprise attacks, artillery barrages, and air strikes
against enemy positions even though there is a high likelihood that
sleeping or unarmed soldiers will become casualties]{.underline}. A
soldier who is killed by artillery cannot defend himself or retaliate
against his attacker--- he is killed in a way that may seem profoundly
unfair. Nevertheless, the killing is not immoral if the soldier is a
participant in hostilities. Soldiers only regain their immunity from
attack when they surrender, are incapacitated, retire from military
service, or temporarily return to the civilian world while on leave.
That is to say, they are liable to attack until they leave the
relationship of enmity that constitutes involvement in war, whereupon
they regain a right against being attacked.

Those who rely on the [asymmetry argument typically frame their points
in the language of just war theory, but this is misleading, as the
permissibility of asymmetric violence is generally accepted among just
war theorists]{.underline}. Walzer [contends that combatants 'are
subject to attack at any time' 69 and says of soldiers who refuse to
attack non-threatening enemies that their actions 'fl y in the face of
military duty.']{.underline} 70 As he explains:

It is important to stress, however, that he \[the combatant\] has not
been forced to fi ght by a direct attack upon his person; that would
repeat the crime of aggression at the level of the individual. He can be
personally attacked only because he already is a fi ghter. He has been
made into a dangerous man, and though his options may have been few, it
is nevertheless accurate to say that he has allowed himself to be made
into a dangerous man. For that reason, he fi nds himself endangered. 71

Gross argues that '\[c\]ombatants are vulnerable regardless of the
immediate threat they pose.' 72 And Primoratz says of soldiers who are
asleep that '\[t\]he soldier may be sleeping right now, but he will wake
up later and resume his part in this business; therefore he is fair game
even when asleep.' 73 There is good reason for this attitude. If
[combatants could only attack each other when they posed a reciprocal
threat, then attacks would only be morally justifi ed when they resemble
a duel.]{.underline} Based on this reasoning that soldiers may be
attacked and killed when they are not threatening, we can ascertain that
it is permissible to attack enemy combatants using drones, even though
the combatants may be just as vulnerable as if they were sleeping.

[Fourth, contra Killmister and Enemark, there is nothing morally
objectionable about forcing an enemy to surrender. If there were, war
could never be justifi able. The objective of war is often to force an
enemy to surrender---'to destroy the ability to resist]{.underline}.' 74
[Forcing a belligerent to surrender does not deprive that belligerent of
the right of self-defense--- it only deprives that belligerent of
victory]{.underline} and nothing in the right of self-defense guarantees
that belligerents will always prevail during war. It would be logically
impossible for opposing belligerents that have a right to wage war to
also have a right to win. Killmister and Enemark are correct in thinking
that weak belligerents could resort to terrorism in an effort to
continue the fi ght when their conventional military forces are
ineffective, but their opponents are not to blame for this. Belligerents
are under no obligation to guarantee that their enemies always have a fi
ghting chance, and belligerents that choose to engage in terrorism are
blameworthy regardless of whether they are at a disadvantage in
conventional military operations.

[Fifth, those who make the asymmetry argument based on a right of
selfdefense misunderstand what that right entails. The right to
self-defense, as the name suggests, is a right to protect oneself
against threats. The right does not guarantee that all acts of
self-defense are successful.]{.underline} This would be impossible,
especially during war. [All combatants who are engaged in war have a
right to self-defense that entitles them to use lethal force against
those who pose an active or imminent threat, yet this right clearly does
not guarantee that every soldier is successful in this]{.underline}.
Some soldiers will fail to protect themselves even as they exercise
their rights. The same is true for states. Opposing belligerents may
each have a right to defend themselves and their citizens, but we
typically expect that one side will fail in protecting itself. The
loser's right remains intact even if that belligerent is unable to win.

Finally, a [strange feature of the debate over drones is that many who
condemn drones alternate between claiming that these weapons will bring
greater symmetry and claiming that they will bring greater
asymmetry.]{.underline} Enemark criticizes the USA for waging risk-free
war with its UAVs and expresses a concern that the US military will act
with less restraint in the future because of its unprecedented
technological dominance. Yet he also says that '\[i\]t will probably not
be long, however, before the numerical and technical superiority of
America's armed drones comes to be challenged by other actors.' 75
[Singer similarly criticizes the use of drones to create radical
asymmetries between powerful armed forces and weaker opponents even as
he expresses concern over the prospects of weak states and VNSAs
building their own drone forces that would make them more militarily
effective. 76]{.underline} Stranger still, [either type of asymmetry is
treated as being morally undesirable by both authors and by others who
shift between these contrary positions. It is diffi cult to see how
asymmetry and symmetry could both be morally undesirable at the same
time]{.underline}. These are contradictory arguments that expose the
inconsistencies underlying the asymmetry objection.

Robert Sparrow has come up with one of th[e most infl uential arguments
against autonomous drones, which attributes their wrongness to the
impossibility of identifying anyone who can be blamed for what they
do.]{.underline} He [argues that autonomy and moral responsibility are
inextricably linked such that any agent that has one must have the
other]{.underline}. Moreover, he [thinks that an autonomous agent must
have the sole and undivided responsibility for its own
actions]{.underline}. 'Where an agent acts autonomously, then, it is not
possible to hold anyone else accountable for its actions. In so far as
the agent's actions were its own and stemmed from its own ends, others
can not be held responsible for them.' 15 [The first problem Sparrow
identifies with autonomous weapons is that they would be incapable of
taking responsibility for their own behavior.]{.underline} Punishing a
machine would be meaningless since machines lack the characteristics
that would allow them to experience punishment as a human would. They
cannot fear incarceration or feel the shame of being publicly
reprimanded.

The [obvious answer to this problem is that the engineers who create
drones or the military commanders that send them into combat could be
blamed for what autonomous drones do.]{.underline} Sparrow anticipates
this objection and attempts to counter it by showing that responsibility
for autonomous weapons cannot be distributed. As he sees it, there are
grounds for holding the users of non-autonomous weapons responsible for
how they are used. They are directly involved in launching attacks with
those weapons and may be at fault for targeting civilians or attacking
recklessly. By contrast, an autonomous machine is in control of its own
actions and cannot be directed by any human operator in the same way a
non-autonomous weapon might be. Thus, Sparrow says: 'To hold the
programmers responsible for the actions of their creation, once it is
autonomous, would be analogous to holding parents responsible for the
actions of their children once they have left their care.' 16 He makes a
similar case for not attributing responsibility to the political and
military leaders that order autonomous drones into battle.

Other opponents of autonomous weapons have seized on Sparrow's argument,
advancing their own versions of it or incorporating Sparrow's reasoning
into their accounts of why these drones should be considered immoral.
Chamayou says that 'since the killer robot incorporates no driver, there
will no longer be anyone directly responsible who can be blamed if
anything happens.' 17 O'Connell argues: 'From the perspective of law,
morality, and strategy, it seems essential that a human being who has
training and conscience and who may be held accountable should always
make the awesome, ultimate decision to kill.' 18

Steinhoff counters Sparrow's argument by attempting to show that [there
is no reason to think that someone must be able to be held responsible
for autonomous weapons.]{.underline} As he correctly points out, [the
ability to assign blame is not generally included among the principles
of just war theory.]{.underline} Just war theory [has little to say
about how those guilty of infractions should be punished or otherwise
forced to pay for the consequences of their actions]{.underline}.
Although Steinhoff is correct on this point, this response to Sparrow is
not entirely satisfying. For one thing, even though just war theory does
not require that someone be held accountable for misconduct, being able
to do this does increase the enforceability of just war precepts. It may
be easier to force belligerents to abide by the principle of
discrimination, for example, if violence against civilians is punished
than if it is not. And enforcement by holding actors responsible would
be impossible from Sparrow's perspective. This does not negate the moral
point that Steinhoff makes, but it does suggest that there is more to
Sparrow's problem than this alone and that [we should want to fi nd
responsible actors even if this is not strictly required by just war
theory.]{.underline}

[Petrenko answers Sparrow's argument by claiming that it would be
possible to attribute responsibility for autonomous drones' actions to
human developers and commanders according to existing standards of
product liability]{.underline}. 19 D[evelopers and commanders may be
guilty of negligence if they fail to protect against foreseeable
misconduct by autonomous drones. They may also be held to a standard of
strict liability,]{.underline} according to which they must be
responsible for autonomous drones' actions even when those actions were
not foreseeable. B[y this standard, anything autonomous weapons systems
do could be attributed to the humans involved in their production and
use. ']{.underline}\[W\]hen the responsibility for harm is spread across
a number of parties involved in the design, manufacturing, or sale of
AWS \[autonomous weapons systems\], strict liability might be extended
to all the parties involved in proportion to their involvement.' 2

This is another promising strategy for refuting the responsibility
concern, though it seems to raise additional questions. First, [applying
domestic tort law to war raises serious legal and conceptual problems.
Domestic law may provide helpful analogies for international confl ict,
but it is a fundamentally different condition. War is an exceptional
state of affairs]{.underline} when some of the most basic moral and
legal guidelines that govern domestic life are suspended. Moreover,
[unlike domestic disputes, wars are confl icts between political
communities. This arguably raises a unique set of moral considerations
that do not exist in domestic contexts]{.underline}, especially when
using standards that are designed to regulate interactions between
individuals or private organizations. Second, Petrenko's suggestion to
assign blame based on a person's proportion of involvement is plausible,
but he does not say how we actually do this. There needs to be some
standard for identifying which actors may be considered blameworthy and
determining their share of responsibility.

As I pointed out earlier in the chapter, [Sparrow's conception of
autonomy is far too strong. He understands autonomy to mean that robots
might become 'full "moral persons."']{.underline} 21 Sparrow's argument
is [only compelling if drones are autonomous to this extent, which means
that it would not apply to autonomous drones that locate and attack
targets based on carefully scripted attack procedures]{.underline}.
Armed [**forces have powerful incentives to avoid** developing machines
that have the degree of independence Sparrow describes, which makes it
important to avoid interpreting his argument as one that would apply
against the kinds of autonomous weapons that are currently in
developmen]{.underline}t or may exist in the foreseeable future. Even if
we assume for the sake of argument that armed forces might create drones
that fi t Sparrow's description, [the task of identifying humans
responsible for misconduct would be fairly straightforward.]{.underline}

The [responsibility problem facing autonomous drones is illusory because
armed forces already have established procedures for attributing
responsibility for the conduct of autonomous actors.]{.underline} 22
[Human soldiers are]{.underline} autonomous fi ghters who are able to
disobey orders, form their own opinions, and willfully engage in immoral
actions. Human soldiers can be blamed for their actions, but they are
[rarely solely responsible]{.underline}. The [military chain of command
is a hierarchy that can help to determine responsibility for
actions]{.underline}. At each level in the chain, [civilian policymakers
and members of the military]{.underline} set the structural conditions
that permit or discourage immoral behavior. [They create or eliminate
possibilities, and this implicates them in the decisions that soldiers
make]{.underline} when they are fi ghting.

It is helpful to consider this by way of example. If an American soldier
in Iraq decides to torture a prisoner, the soldier bears personal
responsibility for his actions and can be justifi ably punished for
acting wrongly. However, the soldier is only in a position to act
immorally because of countless decisions made by others in that
soldier's chain of command. Policymakers may bear some fault for
starting the war that caused the soldier's deployment, and would be even
more clearly blameworthy if they issued directives authorizing prisoner
abuse. Military commanders would be responsible for relaying orders to
abuse prisoners or standing idly by while the abuse takes place as they
have a duty to contest immoral and illegal orders. Moreover, they are
obliged to provide ethics training, police their subordinates' conduct,
screen soldiers for predispositions toward misconduct, and ensure that
effective oversight mechanisms are in place. This means that even if the
prisoner abuse is not authorized by superiors---if it is perpetrated
spontaneously by the soldiers who are directly involved---members of the
military chain of command still bear responsibility for soldiers'
actions.

This example should not stretch our imaginations as it describes the
infamous case of American soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners in Abu
Ghraib[. The Abu Ghraib scandal showed that it is sometimes diffi cult
to punish everyone in the civilian and military chain of command.
Members of the Bush administration who had authorized torture were able
to escape prosecution, as were some military personnel who were in a
position to raise objections. It is, unfortunately, very diffi cult to
actually punish those who are responsible for misconduct during
wars,]{.underline} especially when they are protected by a military
superpower. Nevertheless, [the problem was not in identifying the
responsible parties. Dozens of books and articles have exhaustively
detailed the various ways in which people were indirectly involved in
the abuse in ways that establish moral responsibility]{.underline} and
that could be used to determine legal fault. This is clear evidence that
wrongful acts perpetrated by autonomous actors do implicate others,
contrary to Sparrow's argument. [The most serious challenge is not
determining who is responsible, but designing institutions that are
capable of punishing soldiers and civilian policymakers for
misconduct]{.underline}. But this is a general challenge of military
justice and not a problem that is unique to drones.

[Apportioning responsibility raises the 'many hands problem.' When
everyone is to blame for misconduct, then it is diffi cult to hold any
individual accountable]{.underline}. Each person in a group may bear
such a small share of the overall blame that their mistakes appear to be
excusable or that it is diffi cult to actually punish anyone. Shared
responsibility does have limitations when it comes to clearly
identifying individuals for punishment, but it also has advantages when
directing the conduct of entire organizations. As Osiel points out,
[sharing responsibility for misconduct in the military provides
encouragement for more effective peer monitoring.]{.underline} '\[W\]hen
a person knows that he can be held responsible for the conduct of his
chosen associates, he is more likely to monitor their conduct closely,
scrutinizing it for possible unlawfulness. Conversely, when a person
knows that he can be held responsible only for his own acts, he is less
attentive to the lawfulness of associates' conduct.' 23

If anything, [the **basis for sharing responsibility is stronger with
autonomous drones** than it is with human soldiers]{.underline}. First,
[to the extent that autonomous drones fall short of reaching the same
level of autonomy as humans, they must rely on programming that was
given to them by engineers, military commanders, and civilian
policymakers]{.underline}. Second, no [actor, no matter how autonomous,
is completely detached from outside infl uence]{.underline}. It may be
possible to coerce or infl uence a person to commit a wrongful act in
various ways, without negating that person's autonomy. Persuading
someone to commit a murder, for example, would be wrong even if the
person doing the persuading did not force the murderer's hand. The same
goes for drones, though here the infl uence is even clearer. [There
would be a strong causal link between an autonomous drone and those who
are in a position to infl uence its behavior]{.underline}. Finally,
autonomous drones would probably be heavily dependent on humans for
acquiring the means to carry out attacks. A human can fi nd a rifl e and
shoot a civilian without assistance from an accomplice, but existing
drone designs suggest that these machines will depend on human
assistance when being armed. For example, [an autonomous UAV probably
would **not be able to load missiles onto itself**.]{.underline} Humans
can therefore be held accountable as accomplices that give drones the
capacity to kill, especially if the drones are armed with weapons that
reduce the chance of attacks satisfying the demands of the principles of
discrimination and proportionality.

Thus, [the responsibility objection against autonomous drones can be
solved in several different ways, none of which require any great shift
in our moral thinking. The moral and legal apparatus for evaluating
negligence and shared responsibility is **already in
place**]{.underline}. The real challenge when it comes to responsibility
is designing more effective mechanisms of punishing people who are
indirectly responsible for misconduct. Because this is a policy issue,
it is best addressed through political reforms that are designed to
facilitate investigations of misconduct and prevent offi cials in the
chain of command, especially civilian policymakers, from evading
punishment.

With the inevitable approach of AWSs, [some believe that]{.underline}
chivalry will be eliminated, that [as machines engage other machines,
war will become **dehumanized**]{.underline}.20 1 This does seem
possible, given that UAVs will engage other UAVs in combat.
Nevertheless, to quote Clausewitz, \"war is nothing but the continuation
of \[humanity\'s\] politics by other means. 20 2 In other words, [war
will **always be instigated** and **carried out by humans** who in turn
seek to affect or influence other humans. Warfare will **always be
influenced by human political**, **legal**, **diplomatic**, and
**economic factors**- humanity\'s role as the decision maker **will not

determined by **bloodless wars fought by AWSs duking it out in a
boxing-ring setting**]{.underline}, manned [\[staffed\] by video game

civilians **will always be the victims of war**]{.underline}. This does
of course raise the question of whether compassion or empathy will
decrease as AWS usage further lengthens the distance between human
combatants and the battlefield to a degree. It is also plausible that
people will express fear and disgust with AWSs in the same manner they
protested nuclear weapons in the twentieth century.20 4 Since [human
victims **will always be central to warfare**]{.underline}, chivalric
values will likewise always be relevant, **[regardless of the

dehumanizing enemies into the means that \"fuel the cogs of war,\" by
employing AWSs in a just and respectful manner consistent with the
modern notions of chivalry incorporated into the U.S. military manuals
and traditions.20 6

A [related concern about drones is that they may raise new prospects for
manipulating the civilian public]{.underline}. Because drones mediate
war, placing machines between the human opponents on either side, they
could arguably be used to create a distorted view of what war is like
and what its effects are[.]{.underline} This mediated vision of war
could also influence civilian audiences' attitudes about drones or about
war in general by making it easier to selectively present information
about how attacks are carried out and what costs they have. Civilians
could not only be prevented from seeing the unfortunate consequences
drone strikes may have on innocent people but might also be distracted
from ever engaging in critical inquiry by the flashy videos of drones
launching precise attacks against enemy military targets. Moreover, this
influence could arguably be enacted via the kind of civil--military
technology sharing I discussed in the previous section as civilian media
producers are often complicit in creating the military spectacles for
civilian audiences. 13

This [concern is probably most effectively and famously expressed by
James Der Derian in his discussion of the concept of virtuous
war]{.underline}. 14 Der Derian does not focus on drones, but rather
objects to a pervasive tendency in the representation of war that drones
and other precision weapons participate in. As he sees it, contemporary
wars and representations of war are marked by the logic of 'virtuous
war,' which is a way of showing the action of combat without the
consequences. Details like dead bodies, displaced populations, and
ruined infrastructures are omitted to give the appearance that war is a
relatively clean and casualty-free activity. This is a trend Der Derian
thinks is increasing and that is closely related to robotic weapons. As
[he says, '\[t\]he low risk, high yield strategy of virtuous war has a
logic of its own, in which the human role is shrinking in numbers and
significance in an increasingly robotic battlespace.']{.underline} 15

Many others have expressed similar concerns, either by relying
explicitly on the concept of virtuous war or by developing other
accounts of the underlying phenomenon of the sanitization of war. [Stahl
highlights the extent to which drones are part of a larger process of
merging entertainment and war]{.underline}, with the result that
civilian culture becomes militarized. He argues that militainment has
expanded dramatically in recent decades and has become more insidious as
it has shifted from treating audiences as passive spectators to treating
them like 'virtual citizensoldiers' who are active participants in
simulated wars. For Stahl, drones are particularly important in this
process because they make it possible to wage war in the manner of a
'sci-fi dystopia.' 16 The ethical problem he raises is that militarized
culture encourages citizens, who should be critical judges of war, to
become engaged in fantasies in which they are complacent members of the
military. Military entertainment thus appears to be a way of subverting
democratic accountability and ensuring that citizens will be too busy
playing war to raise any concerns about real wars.

Finally, [Apel argues that real information about war is presented in
carefully constructed ways that are apt to mislead viewers]{.underline}.
'Like video games, the footage of war experience edited and set to music
appeals to the young and creates a decontextualized and depoliticized
effect that heightens visceral sensations while derealizing the less
entertaining effects of war.' 17 Apel cites drones as a prime example of
this tendency as she argues that videos of drone attacks posted online
glorify the strikes by showing their technical precision for those who
like to see 'things blow up without seeing the blood and gore.' 18 As
with Stahl, this characterization of the persuasive effects of media
identifies drones as being a particularly insidious tool for
manipulating civilian audiences.

T[hose who object to biased ways of presenting war are correct in noting
that there is something disconcerting about using drones or other
technologies to conceal the costs of fighting.]{.underline} I agree with
them in thinking that [it is unethical to use drone footage or other
types of imagery to deceive the civilian public or to escape regulative
constraints]{.underline}. Citizens of [democratic societies must have
access to information about war]{.underline}; they need reliable
information to make reasonable decisions about whether to support
military actions, weapons procurements, and the policymakers who are
responsible for making military policy. Without this information
[citizens may not be able to exert the pressure on elected officials
that is essential for maintaining popular sovereignty]{.underline}.
Nevertheless, as with the other problems I have discussed, this critique
is an instance of legitimate fears being poorly framed.

[This objection, like so many of the other criticisms raised against
drones, picks out a few possible misuses of drones while ignoring the
many ways in which drones might be used responsibly]{.underline}. It is
[true that drones could hide the costs of war from drone
operators]{.underline} or the general public, and [that some videos may
have had this effect because they were carefully edited or framed
inaccuratel]{.underline}y. But as I will discuss later[, it is also
possible for drones to be used to provide more accurate information and
increase government accountability]{.underline}. Drones do not simply
increase the prospects for dissimulation. Rather, they [increase the
prospects for dissimulation while also, and unavoidably, raising
unprecedented prospects for accurately representing war.]{.underline}
They may be used to mislead or to inform. Deciding which role they play
is a political challenge that is best approached through the kinds of
regulations I will discuss later. In particular, the possibility that
drones may distort war highlights the importance of having independent
oversight of drone use and ensuring that members of the military are not
able to alter the videos before they are reviewed by oversight bodies.

[Most weapons of modern warfare conceal the casualties they
inflict.]{.underline} In fact, this [critique of drones could be applied
more accurately to the many weapons that not only fail to show the
consequences of their use under certain conditions but may not even be
able to show those consequences under ideal conditions]{.underline}.
[Bombers, artillery, mortars, and landmines are regularly used against
unseen enemies]{.underline} without producing records of their
consequences. That is to say, they [naturally hide the costs they
inflict even under ideal conditions]{.underline} because video records
are not a normal byproduct of operating these weapons. Policymakers and
members of the military may sometimes hide the costs of drone strikes,
but they do this despite the fact that the mediated nature of drone
operations makes them naturally amenable to creating video records.
[Drones' latent potentials do not increase the scope of immoral conduct
(the concealment of war), but do significantly increase the
opportunities for disseminating information about war.]{.underline} We
should not condemn drones for the misuse of the video records. Rather,
[we should recognize that drones increase the prospects of making
battlefields more transparent and condemn the people who fail to take
advantage of this capacity.]{.underline}

### AT: Distortion

#### Drones prevent distortion -- surveillance, reflecting time, and alt causes to attacks

[Claims that distance or mediation cause an escalation of violence are
not supported by evidence from previous conflicts]{.underline}. This
could hardly be more obvious as the entire [history of warfare until the
twentieth century is a testament to how easily people can kill each
other at close range]{.underline} and without any technological
mediation. Soldiers have killed each other in droves [with swords,
spears, arrows, and blunt objects. A number of recent studies have shown
that wars have actually inflicted far fewer casualties as violence has
become more heavily mediated.]{.underline} 26 Moreover, even in an era
when most weapons are used at long range and are in some way mediated,
atrocities continue to be carried out when these supposed barriers are
not in place. The most [egregious humanitarian disasters of the past two
centuries were largely carried out without help from distance or
mediation. The Holocaust, the Rwandan genocide, and the 'killing fields'
in Cambodia]{.underline} come to mind as just a few of the many examples
of atrocities perpetrated at close range.

It is interesting that Dave Grossman's in-depth study of the psychology
of killing has become the most commonly cited source of evidence that
distance facilitates killing. 27 In some respects this is
understandable. [Grossman argues that people have a natural aversion to
killing, especially at close range.]{.underline} This would appear to
suggest that any weapon that is able to mediate or increase the range of
violence would lead to more killing. Grossman's argument is doubtful
given the massive body of evidence to show that people can kill at any
range and the empirical shortcomings of many of his cases. 28 However,
eve[n if we assume that there is a natural aversion to close-range
combat, Grossman argues that this feeling is suppressed by military
training.]{.underline} Indeed, many of his other writings are directed
at showing how easily the aversion to killing can be overcome. He even
goes so far as to argue that violent video games have desensitized
players and turned them into killers. If [this were true, then
Grossman's work could hardly be mobilized as evidence that close-range
war is less violent or more ethical than remote war. On the contrary, he
suggests that the real concern is the military indoctrination that
cultivates a willingness to kill**, not a particular
weapon**]{.underline}.

Of course, [soldiers do sometimes empathize with their opponents--- even
to the extent that they refused to attack them]{.underline}. Soldiers'
narratives of battle are replete with moments in which a soldier decided
not to shoot an enemy who was temporarily humanized. These [moments
appear to have much less to do with distance or mediation than with
mutual recognition of shared humanity or feelings of pity.]{.underline}
Michael Walzer discusses several examples of soldiers who decided not to
attack opponents because these feelings were so profound that they
outweighed the intense political forces driving the soldiers to kill
each other. The soldiers he describes decided not to attack opponents
who were naked, alone, or otherwise unable to fight---soldiers who
appeared to be helpless and non-threatening. A passage from George
Orwell is particularly effective in conveying this experience:

At this moment a man, presumably carrying a message to an officer,
jumped out of the trench and ran along the top of the parapet in full
view. He was half-dressed and was holding up his trousers with both
hands as he ran. I refrained from shooting at him...I did not shoot
partly because of that detail about the trousers. I had come here to
shoot at 'Fascists'; but a man who is holding up his trousers isn't a
'Fascist,' he is visibly a fellow-creature, similar to yourself, and you
don't feel like shooting at him.

The absence of threat is the central theme across Walzer's stories of
soldiers who do not attack. S[oldiers who are threatened by enemies must
fight in self-defense, especially when they are at close range, while
those who face non-threatening or distant enemies have **greater freedom
to reflect on the act of killing** and consider whether it is
warranted]{.underline}. These stories therefore indicate that having a
significant advantage over opponents and being physically distant from
them might actually increase the prospects of soldiers showing empathy
because it allows soldiers to make ethical decisions without having to
worry about being attacked by the enemy whose life is spared.

[Concerns over drones eroding ethical sympathies through distancing and
computer mediation also rely on incorrect assumptions about how wars are
waged when drones are not involved]{.underline}. The [assumption seems
to be that, in the absence of drones, soldiers would fight each other on
relatively equal terms]{.underline} in face-to-face combat. But of
course, nothing could be further from the truth. M[ost soldiers already
fight in ways that put them at great distances from their opponents or
that rely on computer mediation. Pilots]{.underline} who fl y combat
aircraft [frequently drop bombs on unseen opponents from thousands of
feet]{.underline} in the air or launch missiles at enemy aircraft that
may only be visible as small blips on a radar. At times, strafing brings
them close enough to see their targets, but only for brief glimpses. 30
They never have an opportunity to watch their opponents as intently as
UAV pilots do. [Soldiers who operate indirect fi re weapons like
artillery, mortars, and long-range missiles are not only distant from
their opponents but may also have little sense that they are fi ring at
people at all. They direct their attacks against points on a
map]{.underline} or grid coordinates relayed by soldiers in the field.

[Even for soldiers who are physically present on the battlefield and not
inside vehicles, it is often exceedingly difficult to experience the
humanity of enemy combatants]{.underline} or to see those enemies in
ways that might inspire some sense of empathy. During the [recent
conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, it was more common for Coalition
soldiers to be wounded or killed by improvised explosive device (IEDs)
than by enemy fighters they could see]{.underline}. 31 As Bellavia, a
veteran of fighting in Fallujah says, '\[i\]n modern warfare, that
man-to-man challenge is often hidden by modern technology  -- the splash
of artillery fi re can be random, a rocket or bomb or IED can be
anonymous.' 32 During combat, soldiers are apt to seek cover and
concealment, which further impede direct contact. They [camouflage
themselves to avoid being identified as humans. They fight from inside
of buildings, trenches, or bunkers, shielding themselves from enemy fi
re, as well as from any sympathetic view they might receive from their
adversaries.]{.underline} They do everything they can to be invisible to
the enemy, or at least to only become visible for that instant when they
are fighting and not apt to inspire feelings of empathy.

If anything, it seems that drones might be able to generate more
opportunities to empathize with opponents. Because UAV operators can
loiter over target areas for hours without facing any personal risk,
they may watch potential targets without fear of being attacked and have
more opportunities to understand and even empathize with them. [UAVs
cameras may likewise provide a much more intimate perspective than a
soldier could have otherwise. Their overhead view gives their pilots an
excellent view of the people in the target area,]{.underline} and when
those pilots spend hours or even days tracking a potential target, they
understand that person and others who may be affected far more by an
attack than they would in a brief close-range gunfight.

Other [types of drones may not be able to match UAVs when it comes to
giving operators a clear view. Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) will have
limited visual fi elds as they move across the ground and may be seen by
enemy combatants]{.underline}, who could attempt to avoid detection.
Naval [drones are likely to be employed for intercepting boats and
aircraft, which provides little opportunity for visually identifying
human opponents]{.underline}. Nevertheless, these [constraints on
visibility are due to the terrain these drones operate in and the kinds
of threat they may face.]{.underline} Even when they lack the same
ability to track potential targets as UAVs, it is at least clear that
drones will uniformly reduce the costs associated with attempting to
visually identify and track enemies, while also increasing the accuracy
of visual identification with the assistance of optical equipment, which
provides much higher resolution than a human eye.

Of course[, the visibility of potential targets does not guarantee
empathy. It is obviously possible for a drone operator to remorselessly
kill enemies and civilians alike]{.underline}. My point is not that
drones will make the battlefield more humane, only that their [latent
potentials are such that we should expect that they will not cause any
new problems associated with dehumanization and that they may provide
new opportunities for visual experiences that could generate feelings of
empathy]{.underline}. Based on these latent potentials, it is unfair to
blame drones for making it easier to kill or to commit atrocities.

### AT: Fem IR

#### Autonomous weapons can be repurposed towards feminist post-human goals. Anti-militarism doesn't necessitate the elimination of technologies, but it requires intervention at a legal AND discursive level.

**Jones 18** -- *PhD from SOAS University of London, MA from University
College London (UCL), LLB Law degree from the London School of Economics
and Political Science (LSE)* (Emily Jones, 8-1-2018, \"A
Posthuman-Xenofeminist Analysis of the Discourse on Autonomous Weapons
Systems and Other Killing Machines,\" Taylor & Francis,
https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/13200968.2018.1465333)//KH

Despite current trends in military technologies and the ways in which
machines are already helping to make life/death decisions, [neither
algorithmic 'independence', nor AI which decides to kill, nor any type
of superhuman soldier, would be covered under a pre-emptive ban of
autonomous weapons.]{.underline} On the other hand, [a posthuman
approach to autonomous weapons would recognise the connections between
the human and the machine. Such an approach would not fixate on autonomy
but would instead work to break down the false dichotomies between
autonomy--automation and human--machine]{.underline}, instead fo[cusing
on the ethical implications of killer systems]{.underline} across these
lines.146 As noted above, whilst xenofeminism and posthuman feminism
understand the dangers as well as the potentials of technology,
[xenofeminism in particular does not account for the power
of]{.underline} militarism and [the militarism--capitalism
assemblage.]{.underline} It seems, therefore, that [the risks of the
technology--militarism--capitalism assemblage need to be further read
into xenofeminism to ensure that it stays true to its own aims of using
and appropriating technology to construct an intersectional feminist
future]{.underline}.

Braidotti's [posthumanism pays attention to death and modes of dying
while promoting an affirmative posthuman era in the face of the
necropolitical]{.underline}.147 In contrast to the necropolitical
politics of death itself,148 Braidotti proposes 'a politics of life
itself'149 which chooses to tackle the obstacles of the posthuman
condition as they come. She thus states:

It is a constant challenge for us to rise to the occasion, to be 'worthy
of our times', while resisting them, and thus to practise amor fati
affirmatively. It is quite demanding to catch the wave of life's
intensities in a secular manner and ride on it, exposing the boundaries
or limits as we transgress them ... Death is the ultimate transposition,
though it is not final, as zoe carries on, relentlessly.150

[It seems hard, however, to read autonomous weapons in the affirmative
when weapons technologies kill people in ever more removed and
de-personalised ways. Autonomous weapons, are/will be the child of the
military economy.]{.underline} As Braidotti notes, however, [to analyse
in the affirmative is not to deny the horror of our times. Affirmation
'proposes a different way of dealing with' such horrors]{.underline}.151

I propose that [xenofeminism provides an affirmative blueprint for
embracing the current times.]{.underline} I have noted how xenofeminist
method works to appropriate technology and existing political
structures, bending them to feminist aims.152 While the current form of
xenofeminism does not fully account for the links between technology and
militarism, this does not mean that xenofeminism cannot accommodate such
concerns. [Xenofeminist method is an affirmative approach in that it
notes the contradictions and risks in the posthuman condition and works
to deconstruct them.]{.underline}

Thus, [taking an affirmative posthuman-xenofeminist perspective, one
which understands the ways in which the human and the machine are deeply
interconnected, I wish to use xenofeminist method -- the **appropriation
of technology for feminist aims** -- to propose a posthuman-xenofeminist
discourse on autonomous weapons.]{.underline} While the [XFM does not
explicitly address the threat to life technology could
pose]{.underline}, the wish to define and use technology for feminist
aims, I have already suggested, inherently [includes the wish to ensure
that technology remains ethical]{.underline}. Taking this further, it is
important to note that [anti-militarism is a key part of the feminist
project]{.underline} as exemplified by the Women's Peace Conference of
1915, to the feminist activism of Greenham Common, to the ways in which
Haraway, in her early foundational works, highlighted anti-militarism as
a key feminist project.153 While there are many feminists who do not
promote an anti-violence stance, **[choosing to fight as part of their
feminism]{.underline}**, for example, this [**does not preclude an
anti-militarism stance** in the realm of military
technologies]{.underline}.154 Neither does an anti-militarism stance in
this area wish to judge those who engage in fighting as part of their
feminist project as 'not feminists', nor to associate feminism
inherently with peace. Rather, in noting the history of anti-militarism
within the international feminist project, I wish to suggest that there
is a need to promote an ethics of anti-militarism at the international
structural level. This is precisely because of [the ways in which
militarism structures the global order, working to structure
technological innovation and development alongside forces such as
capitalism, colonialism, and other power structures. Such a stance must
therefore be contrasted to more contextual scenarios, where **fighting
may indeed be the best form of feminist response**]{.underline}**.** In
this sense, [anti-militarism must be distinguished from an anti-violence
position, with anti-militarism aiming to challenge the industrial,
technologically crafted, capitalist-driven military complex and with an
anti-violence position calling more broadly for peace and
non-violence.]{.underline} It thus follows, given the links between
militarism, technological advancements, and capitalism, that
[xenofeminism, as a project aiming to appropriate technology for
feminist aims, must have regard for anti-militarism. A xenofeminist
appropriation of technology must therefore include the desire to ensure
that the technology of now and the future cannot be used either for
military gains or for the taking of human or nonhuman
life]{.underline}.155 Xenofeminist method provides an affirmative method
for dealing with the current times and the issue of military
technologies.

D[rawing on the will to appropriate technology for feminist aims and to
create the future from the present, manipulating, hacking, and coding
the system, it seems that the appropriation of technology includes
ensuring that technology can only be developed in ethical
ways.]{.underline} Technology is dependent on a set of programming
choices which will shape machine intelligence as technology advances.
[What choices are made now, what programming choices are made in these
current times, could structure the entire future of technology and
machine intelligence]{.underline}. **[There is a need for feminist
posthuman perspectives and xenofeminist infiltrations
now.]{.underline}**

The xenofeminists know well that it matters who makes those programming
choices. As Haraway puts it, '[it matters which figures figure figures,
which systems systematize systems'.156 Noting that 'technology isn't
inherently progressive', the xenofeminists call for an intervention in
these choices.]{.underline}157 While intelligent machines could indeed
be the end of humanity, such machines may not make such choices. It is
important to get the now right in the hope of working towards a future
where the machine and human can work together ethically. As Haraway
notes,

'[the machine is us, our processes, an aspect of our embodiment. We can
be responsible for machines: they do not dominate or threaten us. We are
responsible for boundaries; we are they']{.underline}.158

T[he XFM advocates the **infiltration of multiple discourses**.159 I
propose **this could include law.**]{.underline} I have argued that the
[discourse on autonomous weapons needs to be made posthuman, emphasising
the links between the machine and the human and the ways in which seeing
the **autonomous weapon as the machinic other is a
fallacy**]{.underline}. [Xenofeminist method calls for the appropriation
of technology to promote,]{.underline} in Braidotti's terms,
[affirmative aims: constructing the future from the now]{.underline}.
While many of the [groups calling for a legal ban of autonomous weapons
may be overlooking some of the nuances]{.underline} in the debate and
definitions, [their larger goal -- to seek legal frameworks to regulate
these systems -- is an aim which can remain useful.]{.underline} After
all, legal regulation is a core manner in which profit-making tech
creators may be forced to shape their innovations in ethical ways. In
other words, a xenofeminist method may include not only the
appropriation of technology itself but also the frameworks which
regulate it. These frameworks are key in structuring future developments
of technology, and thus work to appropriate technology through
structuring the creation of technology from the outset. In line with
xenofeminist method, therefore, I propose that a legal framework is
needed to ensure that feminist ethics of anti-militarism, justice, and
intersectionality remain central to technological innovation. [A
feminist posthuman understanding of technology is required here: to
ensure that the dark sides of technology are evaded whilst
**technology's positive, subjectivity-challenging and
capitalism-destroying potential is maintained**]{.underline}. There is a
need to focus on the regulation of all technologies, given the real
possibility that killer machines may be created in multiple ways.

There have been steps in other contexts towards creating broader ethical
regulations for technology. This can be seen in the example of the
European Parliament Resolution of 16 February 2017, which makes
recommendations to the Commission on Civil Law Rules on Robotics.160 The
Resolution is well thought out, considering a variety of issues around
the legal regulation of technology and noting issues around liability,
care robots, autonomous vehicles, and privacy issues.161 The Resolution
calls for the urgent need to regulate technologies.162 While the
Resolution opens up debate on these issues, it is non-binding and seeks
to regulate non-military technologies, thus upholding a false binary
between military and civil technologies despite the clear cross-overs.
As noted above, many civil technologies were originally created for
military purposes, and there also remains a risk that civil intelligent
technologies may decide to kill or may be easily adapted to make them
kill.163 In addition, the Resolution does not consider human enhancement
technologies despite emerging developments in this area. This trend
towards focusing on the immediate present and categorising military and
non-military technologies separately is repeated throughout legal and
policy attempts to regulate these technologies. There is an urgent need
for a posthuman-xenofeminist infiltration of the discussions around the
legal regulation of technology, working to promote a future-facing
feminist posthuman perspective which understands the cross-overs between
civil and military technologies, the human and the machine, and autonomy
and automation. [While technology may be largely controlled at present
by a capitalist elite with strong ties to militarism, this does not mean
this technology will inevitably remain in their hands and under their
control.]{.underline} By ensuring that basic ethical principles are
applied now, through the application of laws to regulate programming
choices and technological innovation in the present[, technology can be
shaped, working towards a post-capitalist, fairer, more ethical and
just, feminist world.]{.underline}

### AT: Full Autonomy

#### This is science fiction---humans will always be in the loop

**Toscano, 15**---Navy Judge Advocate and 2014 LLM Graduate of the
George Washington University Law School (Christopher, "Friend of Humans:
An Argument for Developing Autonomous Weapons Systems," 8 J. Nat\'l Sec.
L. & Pol\'y 189 (2015), dml)

Full autonomy is more complex and remains the subject of much debate at
legal and philosophical levels.51 [Full autonomy implies that the robot
can act **without human direction**, **assistance**, or **input**, and
can adapt to its environment **independently**]{.underline}. s 2 [More
extreme interpretations suggest that a machine]{.underline} that has
full autonomy [will become \"**self-aware**\" and may choose to **go
rogue** because of free will]{.underline}.5 3 Undoubtedly, these
interpretations are derived from the conflation of human with robotic
autonomy, as unpacked in Part V. However, [the DoD]{.underline}
directive **[does not go to this extreme]{.underline}**. The directive
defines a fully autonomous weapons system as able to \"select and engage
targets without further intervention by a human operator.\",5 4
Furthermore, the directive defines AWSs as inclusive of both
\"human-supervised \[AWSs\] that are designed to allow human operators
to override operation of the weapon system \[and those that\] can select
and engage targets without further human input after activation. 5 5
Placing this in the context of autonomy scale and the loop, [the
directive implies that a human operator is **on the loop for
monitoring** and **overriding purposes**]{.underline}, but sliding to
the right, toward \"out of the loop\" where there is no human
interaction.5 6 Still, [the]{.underline} directive\'s [**overarching
theme of human supervision** involved in the development, testing, and
operation of AWSs suggests]{.underline} that the DoD has [**no immediate
plans** to place itself "out of the loop]{.underline}." 5 7

Clashing viewpoints have served to obfuscate and misrepresent the
practical reality of the term \"full autonomy\" in current technologies,
as applied to AWSs.i8 As we will see in Part IV, [fully autonomous
AWSs]{.underline}, as described by the DoD, [will require a **more
sophisticated system architecture** and]{.underline} artificial
intelligence (**[AI]{.underline}**) in order for the system to carry out
its objectives without human intervention and be IHL compliant.5 9 [This
level of Al, let alone more advanced Al, where a robot is capable of
exceeding human counterparts, is **currently not
available**]{.underline}. 60 [Recognizing this technological
gap]{.underline}, which is compounded with the ongoing confusion
surrounding robotic autonomy, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [**does not plan to pursue** or **employ
out-of-the-loop machines** in the near term,]{.underline} with the
possibility of a policy change when technology evolves.61 In the
interim, [humans **will remain involved** to some extent in the
machines\' processes, if for no other reason than to **monitor AWS
progress**. Even if AWS capabilities evolve to a sophisticated level
exceeding human capabilities, humans **will still be needed to design**,
**program**, **deploy**, and **debrief AWSs**]{.underline}. 63 Moreover,
[as a **precautionary measure**, AWS programming will **undoubtedly
include human-developed restrictions** on the AWS Al to **preclude
mishaps** or **malfunctions** leading to unnecessary death and
destruction. Notions suggesting that evolved AWSs will **become
self-aware**, \"**go rogue**,\" or **overtake humans** in functions or
policy decisions is **pure science fiction**]{.underline}; they should
be disregarded in any serious AWS discussions.64 For the foreseeable
future, [humans **will never be fully out of the loop**]{.underline} and
the term \"autonomous weapons system\" should be interpreted in light of
the DoD\'s directive. 6s

### AT: Human Rights Law Fails

#### They don't account for tech developments---they're [already solving]{.underline} human rights concerns and will [only continue]{.underline}

**Toscano, 15**---Navy Judge Advocate and 2014 LLM Graduate of the
George Washington University Law School (Christopher, "Friend of Humans:
An Argument for Developing Autonomous Weapons Systems," 8 J. Nat\'l Sec.
L. & Pol\'y 189 (2015), dml)

[A]{.underline} final [criticism is that AWSs will **undermine Human
Rights Law**]{.underline} (HRL), an argument put forth in a report
published by HRW.2 87 The report contends that AWS use would violate HRL
principles, many of which underpin or inherently exist within IHL.288
The report points out that during an armed conflict, IHL is the
governing law (lex specialis); the report goes on to interpret certain
human rights provisions.2 89 While it is true that HRL and IHL overlap
in certain respects, the former does not comprise the latter. The IHL
remains lex specialis - and that debate is beyond the scope of this
article. Ignoring this consideration, [their report]{.underline} first
[argues that AWSs will **undermine the right to life** by engaging in
arbitrary killing]{.underline}. 90 In their words, the HRL understanding
of arbitrary killing refers, by extension, to unlawful killing under
IHL. 9 1 [Second]{.underline}, HRW [argues that AWSs will **violate the
right to a remedy** because no one could be held accountable for AWS
mishaps resulting in unlawful injury, death, or destruction and
reiterates that current accountability measures are wholly
inadequate]{.underline}. 92 [Lastly]{.underline}, HRW [posits that the
use of AWSs **violates the principle of dignity**, further dehumanizing
warfare by delegating the use of lethal force to inanimate
objects]{.underline}.2 93

As with similar critiques, the problem with [their entire
analysis]{.underline} is that HRW [makes **notional** and **very
speculative assumptions** about the **development**, **evolution**, and
**employment of future technology not yet currently
available**]{.underline}. Furthermore, HRW [assumes lawmakers\' and
commanders\' decisions will **arbitrarily allow wholly unpredictable**
or **unmanageable weapons to be employed**]{.underline}. Driven by [this
assumption]{.underline}, HRW calls for an outright ban on the technology
and, by extension, [**immediately dismisses any possibility of
collaboration** that could **shape AWS development toward greater
humanitarian protections**]{.underline}. Many of these considerations
have already been addressed. [**Nothing in AWS technology alters the
law** or **negates accountability**]{.underline}, whether HRL or IHL. In
fact, [the role of humans will **remain the key factor**]{.underline} in
this entire debate. [Designers, developers, human operators and
managers, regulators, and policymakers, **will all set constraints** on
AWS actions.]{.underline}2 94 Giving humans some credit, [the DoD has
**already institutionalized the need** to keep humans in the AWS
decision loop and the need for humans to **thoroughly test AWSs** to
safeguard against mishaps]{.underline}.29 5 [As the technology
**continues to progress**, further U.S domestic legal or policy debate
and revisions **will likely occur**]{.underline}.

### AT: Ks Of Just War Theory

#### Just war theory predates and has evolved away from Christian morality

**Shulzke 17** -- *Lecturer in International Relations at the University
of York, UK, PhD in Political Science from the University at Albany,
State University of New York, US, in 2013 with a dissertation on how
soldiers make ethical decisions during counterinsurgency operations.*
(Marcus, "The Morality of Drone Warfare and the Politics of Regulation,"

Finally, some argue that just war theory cannot live up to its own
goals[. Critics have questioned just war theory's utility by arguing
that it has failed to promote accountability, 24 that it legitimizes
war, 25 or that it promotes the demonization of enemies]{.underline}. 26
These are serious charges as they suggest that just war theory could
provide a false sense of moral certainty or that it may even intensify
wars beyond what we might expect when they are governed by other norms
or political conventions. [If these critiques are right, then any effort
to evaluate drones using just war theory may arguably perpetuate just
war theory's self-defeating tendencies and lead us to pass misguided
judgments on new military technologies]{.underline}.

The [impression that just war theory is a Western and Christian moral
tradition has a degree of truth. Just war thinking was heavily
influenced by its Christian origins]{.underline} and continues to have
theological elements in some of its contemporary variants. 27 [However,
the ideas contained in just war theory are not unique to Christian
theology or even Western moral theory. Some just war concepts predate
Augustine and other Christian writers, 28 others have emerged from
relatively recent secular just war theory, and many have parallels in
other moral traditions.]{.underline} 29 As Martin Cook points out,
'\[t\]he fundamental [moral impulse behind just war thinking is a strong
sense of the moral evils involved in taking human life.]{.underline}' 30
And this is a commitment that transcends Western religious values. [Just
war theory's theoretical strengths and the intuitive appeal of its
underlying moral commitments have led it to become the dominant language
for evaluating the morality of armed confl icts]{.underline}. 3

[Just war theory is increasingly distancing itself from its intellectual
origins]{.underline}. Since the late 1970s, com[mentators from around
the world have attempted to systematically reevaluate virtually every
element of just war theory. This has been the source of some major
changes to the just war tradition, including fundamental reevaluations
of its uniquely Western and Christian elements]{.underline}. Even more
importantly, many of just war theory's core tenets have been codifi ed
in international law. 32 This places civilian politicians and military
professionals under greater pressure than ever to abide by just war
norms. It also raises the prospect of punishing deviations from those
norms, either through informal mechanisms rooted in public condemnation
or through formal legal processes.

### AT: Lowers Barriers To War

#### Empirically disproven---public opinion checks

**Toscano, 15**---Navy Judge Advocate and 2014 LLM Graduate of the
George Washington University Law School (Christopher, "Friend of Humans:
An Argument for Developing Autonomous Weapons Systems," 8 J. Nat\'l Sec.
L. & Pol\'y 189 (2015), dml)

[Critics]{.underline} also [argue that **mere possession** of AWSs will
**lower the barriers to warfare**]{.underline}. Philosophy professor
Peter Asaro argues that the aim of military technology is to develop
tactical advantages while lowering combat risks and casualties.2 66 He
contends that by reducing the negative consequences of war, governments
with advanced technologies will be incentivized to start wars with other
states.2 67 He further argues that every war begins with the actions of
unjust nations, and that such nations will seek to use these
technologies to impose their will on others.268 He states that [nations
will argue that using AWSs is a \"safe\" form of fighting that limits
casualties, to **strategically justify belligerence**]{.underline}.2 6 9
Similarly, Sharkey argues that tyrannical despots or terrorists can use
these weapons to kill civilians. 270 [These arguments]{.underline},
however, [are **flawed** for two reasons]{.underline}.

[First]{.underline}, Asaro\'s [argument ignores the **greater
political**, **economic**, and **legal implications** associated with
war]{.underline}.2 7 1 [Technological superiority alone has **never
served as the impetus for war**. If this were true, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would have engaged in
expansive warfare **simply for being technologically superior** to other
nations]{.underline}. Moreover, [the **power of public opinion has
grown**]{.underline} through the Internet, as mentioned earlier. [**Any
loss of life** through AWS warfare on either side **can sway that public
opinion**. So while one party to the conflict may enjoy lower
causalities through technological superiority, that nation\'s populace
**may still disapprove** when it sees the results. Secondly, **all
military technological advancements** have made the process of warfare
easier]{.underline}.272 In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, crossbows
allowed a peasant to kill a professional knight more effectively and
from greater distances.2 73 Because of this, Pope Urban II banned the
use of crossbows in 1096, and other leaders ordered that captured
crossbowmen were either to be dismembered or killed.274 However, [a
weapon\'s ability to kill an opponent more effectively or from greater
distances **does not embolden terrorists** or **provide justification
for war under jus ad bellum**. Although AWSs offer the ability to kill
at greater distances, that proposition **would also be true for
missiles** or **cannon fire**. Similarly, if a terrorist or rogue state
has the ability to develop an AWS, then it likely has the ability to
**develop any weapon**, **nuclear bombs included**]{.underline}. In
essence, [AWSs are simply subject to the same \"**general problem of
disarmament**\" applicable to all weapons]{.underline}.2 75 [Arguments
that the possession or usage of AWSs will **in itself lower barriers to
warfare** or **further embolden tyranny** and **terrorism are fatally
flawed**]{.underline}.

### AT: Moral Hazard

#### We [impact turn]{.underline} this---moral hazard causes [human error]{.underline} and [miscalc]{.underline}---LAWs are [net better]{.underline}

**Umbrello, et al, 20**---Institute for Ethics and Emerging
Technologies, University of Turin (Steven, with Phil Torres, Project for
Future Human Flourishing, and Angelo De Bellis, University of Edinburgh,
"The future of war: could lethal autonomous weapons make conflict more
ethical?," AI & Society, 35, 273--282 (2020), dml)

Yet, we would argue, such [positions are predicated on an **unfounded
fear** that taking control away from humans will enable robotic weaponry
to **demolish current**, **human-involved warfare practices**.
**Extrapolating techno-development trends into the future**, it is
**reasonable to expect** future robotic weapons to acquire the capacity
to **reliably** and **accurately differentiate** between combatants and
noncombatants]{.underline} (Sharkey 2012; Egeland 2016); [this **could
even occur in the near future**]{.underline} (see Guizzo 2016). Indeed,
Ronald [Arkin]{.underline} (2008) [anticipates such
technologies]{.underline}---in particular, recognition software---[to
not only be **developed** but **surpass human performance
capabilities**]{.underline} (see also O'Meara 2011; Egeland 2016). As he
writes, "we must protect the innocent non-combatants in the battlespace
far better than we currently do. Technology can, must, and should be
used toward that end." Like Nadeau, Arkin believes that [moral LAWs
would act in an **ethically superior way** to humans in
war]{.underline}, saying that:

The commonplace occurrence of slaughtering civilians in conflict over
millennia gives rise to my pessimism in reforming human behaviour yet
provides optimism for robots being able to exceed human moral
performance in similar circumstances (Arkin 2015).

[One must also take into account the consequences of **humans personally
engaging in warfare**. **Historical records**]{.underline}, including
those of concurrent military engagements, [recount **numerous acts of
barbarism** as a result of the **harsh conditions** that combatants are
exposed to]{.underline} (Arkin 2015). In fact, Lin et al. (2008) discuss
how [one of the **most attractive prospects** of LAWs is their
**inability to be affected by emotions** on the battlefield]{.underline}
(Lin et al. 2008). It is the **[emotional distress]{.underline}** that
often [causes combatants to **mistreat the enemy** and **commit war
crimes**]{.underline}. Hence, [the introduction of LAWs that are
**unaffected by such emotional stress** serves as an **incentive for
continued development**]{.underline} (Klincewicz 2015).3

Second, [the **emotional** and **physical pressures** that human
combatants must endure during wartime have **performance costs**. The
fatigue of a long and drawn-out battle affects the ability of individual
soldiers to **perform optimally**, and thus affects the **accuracy of
their shots**]{.underline} (Burke et al. 2007; Nibbeling et al. 2014).
[LAWs are **naturally unaffected** by similar physical pitfalls and can
always]{.underline}---as long as the physical infrastructure is designed
optimally from the start---[permit the LAWs to **continually perform
accurately** and **as expected**.]{.underline}

[The ability for LAWs to engage in **unwavering**, **precise combat**
also **resolves some ethical issues** that arise from human-waged
war]{.underline}. In light of the fact that LAWs do not possess emotions
to guide their behaviors or personal stakes that affect their combat
approaches, [LAWs will always perform duties accurately under **even the
most**]{.underline} physically---or to a human,
emotionally---[**stressful conditions**, thus enabling them
to]{.underline}, at least more often than not, [kill in a **more humane
manner**. LAWs can be programmed to **only engage targets in manners
deemed most ethical** based on the dynamics of war at the time of
combat]{.underline}: the changing environment, the weapons being used by
both the aggressor and the defender, and the characteristics of the
target (human, robot, or physical structure).

[**Already**, computerized weapons platforms can engage targets **far
more accurately than any human counterpart can**]{.underline} (Geibel
1997; Shachtman 2007; Katz and Lappin 2012; United States Navy 2017).
Strong arguments can be levied that [LAWs outfitted with such weapons
platforms could engage in otherwise normal wartime duties but in a means
that is **far more accurate** and thus **ethical**]{.underline}4 [as a
consequence of LAWs' **technological superiority**]{.underline}.

[Part of this ethical prowess exhibited by LAWs is not only because they
**never tire**, but because they are **impervious** to the
**psychological shortcomings of humans**]{.underline}. Though a
contentious topic, [**several high-profile cognitive psychologists**
suggest that humans **fabricate reasons for their actions after
committing them**]{.underline} (Davidson 1982; Nadeau 2006). Thus, [it
is human to be **irrational**, to **make unreasoned decisions** toward
an action that is then validated after carrying through. Such is **not
the nature of a robot**]{.underline}. As mentioned, [LAWs **do not have
any particular affinity to** or **personal interests in surviving
battle**; they **do not have any drive to exhibit particular harshness**
against enemies of a certain culture; and they **do not**]{.underline},
outside of their goals, [**worry about winning the war** and heading
back home after using any unsavory methods to do so. What they do mind
is their **particular set of rules**, their **value-laden code** that
dictates **how they are to conduct themselves in an ethical manner**
during combat]{.underline}.

### AT: No Norms

#### LAWs are inevitable---limiting the tech [fails]{.underline}---[existing norms]{.underline} are [sufficient]{.underline}

**Anderson and Waxman, 13**---professor of international law at
Washington College of Law, American University AND professor of law at
Columbia Law School, an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations, and a member of the Hoover Institution's Task Force on
National Security and Law (Kenneth and Matthew, "LAW AND ETHICS FOR
AUTONOMOUS WEAPON SYSTEMS: WHY A BAN WON'T WORK AND HOW THE LAWS OF WAR
CAN," American University Washington College of Law Research Paper No.
2013-11, dml)

[The **incremental development** and **deployment** of autonomous weapon
systems is **inevitable**, and **any attempt** at a global ban will be
**ineffective** in stopping their use by the states whose acquisition of
such weaponry would be **most dangerous**. Autonomous weapon systems are
**not inherently unlawful** or **unethical**. **Existing legal norms are
sufficiently robust** to]{.underline} enable us to [**address the new
challenges** raised by robotic systems]{.underline}. The best way to
adapt existing norms to deal with these new technologies is a combined
[and]{.underline} international-national dialogue designed to [**foster
common standards** and **spread best practices**]{.underline}.

### AT: Precision/Civilian Casualties

#### All metrics indicate drones are the [most precise weapon we have]{.underline}---their ev conflates [tech]{.underline} with [policy]{.underline} and makes [perfection]{.underline} the enemy of a [good weapon]{.underline}

**Dvorsky, 15**---senior staff reporter at Gizmodo, citing Michael
Horowitz, associate professor of political science at the University of
Pennsylvania, Peter Singer, Strategist for the New America Foundation,
not the eugenics dude, and Paul Scharre, Senior Fellow and Director of
the 20YY Warfare Initiative at the Center for a New American Security
(George, "Is War Becoming More Humane?,"
<https://gizmodo.com/is-war-becoming-more-humane-1735636987>, dml)

But according to Michael Horowitz, [modern guided weapons have become
**significantly more precise** over the past several decades,
**dramatically reducing civilian casualties** when used correctly.
**Evidence** collected]{.underline} by the New America Foundation, a
non-partisan think tank, **[affirms this claim]{.underline}**,
particularly as it pertains to actions in Pakistan. During the course of
the Obama Administration, somewhere between 129 to 161 civilians were
killed in Pakistan, while 1,646 to 2,680 militants were killed. But
[since 2012, **no civilians have been killed at all** in
Pakistan]{.underline} (according to NAF data).

Undoubtedly, [precision bombing has **come a long way** in the past 75
years]{.underline}. Guidance systems were so primitive in the 1940s that
it took around 9,000 bombs to destroy a single building. Entire
communities were leveled in the effort to destroy military targets
(though it's important to remember that Allied forces also deliberately
targeted civilians during WWII). [Today we have **laser** and **GPS
guided missiles**]{.underline}, but back during the Second World War,
field tests demonstrated that less than 5% of rockets fired at a tank
actually hit the target---and that was in a test where the tank was
painted white and stationary.

"[Some modern precision munitions are **accurate to within five feet**,
meaning **fewer bombs are dropped** and **fewer civilians
die**]{.underline}," says Horowitz. "Most militaries actually prefer
using [precision munitions]{.underline} simply because \[they\] [help
militaries accomplish their missions with **higher confidence** and
**lower costs**]{.underline}."

Horowitz says that [countries can use **even the most precise weapons**
in ways that **generate more suffering than necessary**]{.underline}.
The recent U.S. bombing of a hospital in Afghanistan certainly comes to
mind---an act which the charity Doctors Without Borders says may be a
violation of the Geneva Conventions. Regrettably, mistakes and
recklessness are still part of the equation, as witnessed by the 2014
U.S. drone strike that killed 12 people on their way to a wedding.

"[But **in general**, the **more precise the weapon**, the **lower the
risk of civilian casualties**]{.underline}," says Horowitz.

Singer claims that [people often **misconstrue the capabilities** of new
weapons]{.underline} in two ways when it comes to civilian casualties.

"First [they **expect perfection**, **as if there could be such a thing
in war**]{.underline}," he says. "[Mistakes happen all the time **even
with precise weapons**, with the causes ranging from **tech failure** to
**bad information** on the target's identity, to **maybe it wasn't a
mistake**]{.underline}. And second, [we've **changed our level of our
expectations**]{.underline}. Actions like the firebombing of Tokyo were
accepted back in 1940s, while [**single digit casualty counts** are
viewed by many as **unacceptable** today]{.underline}, rightly so
according to most ethicists."

[When it comes to drone strikes]{.underline}, Scharre says that the
[objections are **not about the technology** of drones, but America's
**counterterrorism policy**]{.underline}.

"[What some people are objecting to is **not the drone**, but the fact
that the U.S. is killing terrorists on **what doesn't seem like a
traditional battlefield**, or **in a war** as we typically recognize
it]{.underline}," says Scharre. "[There's **no question** that drones
are **more precise than other alternative weapons**]{.underline},
whether they are cruise missiles, aircraft, or artillery shells."

Scharre says that [high-precision weapons like drones allow the military
to **choose the time** and **manner** of attack---typically when targets
are **alone** and when there **aren't civilians around**]{.underline}.

#### Autonomy doesn't prevent discrimination---they don't assume future developments

**Toscano, 15**---Navy Judge Advocate and 2014 LLM Graduate of the
George Washington University Law School (Christopher, "Friend of Humans:
An Argument for Developing Autonomous Weapons Systems," 8 J. Nat\'l Sec.
L. & Pol\'y 189 (2015), dml)

[Critics]{.underline} also [argue that AWSs will be **incapable of
discriminating between combatants** and **innocent
civilians**]{.underline}. Robotics professor Noel Sharkey argues robots
could not be programmed to understand the difference between a civilian
and a combatant.2 0 4 HRW\'s report, which Sharkey advised on, expounds
on this point by arguing that \"fully autonomous weapons would not have
the ability to sense or interpret the difference between soldiers and
civilians especially in contemporary combat environments. 2 65 Thus,
Sharkey and HRW advise that further AWS development should be
prohibited. [Their \"**take-our-word-for-it**\" approach is based on the
**current state of technology**, **excluding the possibility of
innovative developments** over the long haul, and it is **currently
inaccurate** in limited environments]{.underline} (e.g., no-fly zones).
In short, [critics argue that AWSs will never distinguish between
civilians and combatants, basing this conclusion **solely upon current
empirical data** or **theories**, rather than participating in a debate
to **ensure that the inevitable development** in AWS technology
**meets** or **exceeds the parameters set by IHL**]{.underline}.

### AT: Sanitization/Culture Militarization

#### Civil-military overlap in drone control is overblown and no different than other military applications

**Shulzke 17** -- *Lecturer in International Relations at the University
of York, UK, PhD in Political Science from the University at Albany,
State University of New York, US, in 2013 with a dissertation on how
soldiers make ethical decisions during counterinsurgency operations.*
(Marcus, "The Morality of Drone Warfare and the Politics of Regulation,"
New Security Challenges, Palgrave Macmillan London, ISBN:
978-1-137-53380-7, DOI: <https://doi.org/10.1057/978-1-137-53380-7>,

[Commentators who accuse drones of merging military and civilian
technologies in problematic ways raise a number of interrelated points
that need to be disentangled]{.underline}. Some of their ethical
concerns could motivate a reevaluation of how drones and their
associated technologies are produced. In particular, [there is a danger
of civil--military interaction being an avenue for wasteful spending or
of collaboration leading to links that erode the division between the
military and civilian industry.]{.underline} We should, of course, be
alert to new developments in civil--military cooperation that could
compromise the integrity of those in one or both domains. Nevertheless,
[the practice of borrowing or licensing existing technologies for use in
drones is not inherently problematic.]{.underline} [There is reason to
think that technology sharing is harmful when there is clear evidence of
wasteful spending]{.underline}, misappropriation, or inappropriate
recruiting practices, but critiques of civil--military technology
sharing do not stop at these clear cases of corruption. As the above
examples illustrate, many commentators suggest that even mundane
instances of technology sharing induce civilians to join the military,
train civilians to fight, or trivialize war. That is to say, [these
critics suggest that any form of civil--military sharing could influence
how people think about war. This type of ideational critique is most
prominent when the offending technologies cited by critics of drone
warfare are associated with entertainment,]{.underline} as evidenced by
the [objections to using Xbox controllers in military
roles.]{.underline} These critiques suggest that there is something
disconcerting about the military borrowing civilian entertainment
devices---especially when soldiers may be using similar devices to kill
people.

[It is unclear why it should matter, at least from a moral perspective,
that some technologies have both civilian and military
applications]{.underline}. [Global positioning systems (GPS) are used in
missile guidance systems]{.underline} as well as in the commercially
available devices that guide drivers. Some [synthetic materials, such as
nylon, have their origins in military research programs.
And]{.underline} certain [techniques for food preservation, including
canning and the substitution of margarine for butter, were first adopted
by armies struggling with logistical impediments]{.underline}. These
kinds of technology [sharing are not morally problematic, especially
when the military and civilian applications of the technologies are
usually far removed from each other]{.underline}. It is [unlikely that
many people who play an Xbox or use an iTouch know that these devices
have military applications]{.underline} (unless they are already in the
military and familiar with the control systems), which [makes it
unlikely that using these devices will increase support for military
operations]{.underline} or otherwise cause problematic shifts in
civilians' attitudes toward war.

It [makes sense for developers to create controls that will be familiar
to most user]{.underline}s, as in the case of drone controls being
modeled on controls used for videogame consoles. [Armed forces regularly
make use of skills that soldiers have learned during civilian life. They
seek recruits who are in good physical condition, which usually assumes
that they were physically active prior to joining the
military]{.underline}. They likewise [seek recruits who are intelligent,
which requires previous education in civilian schools]{.underline}. The
military's practice of taking advantage of recruits' capacities and
actively seeking those whose civilian aptitudes would make them good
soldiers typically goes unnoticed, so [why should we respond harshly
when militaries try to make the best use of recruits' experience in
playing videogames]{.underline} or using other digital media?

Technology sharing seems benign when it is largely invisible and cannot
have any plausible persuasive function. Stahl's comment about an Xbox
processor serving as a model for the design of the Predator is a prime
example of this. [12 It would be concerning if Xbox was used to promote
the use of Predator drones or if Predators were used to advertise game
systems, as this would represent a dangerous effort to infl uence
people's judgments about drones through subversion]{.underline}. It is
not clear why it should matter that military and civilian technologies
share some parts when this cannot plausibly be a mechanism of promoting
war or discouraging civic engagement in military affairs. If anything,
it [is less objectionable for the military to borrow existing
technologies or even to license them from civilian companies than for
the military to spend taxpayer money]{.underline} on unnecessary
research and development costs.

[We should conclude that while it is good to carefully scrutinize the
relations of production that make drones possible and to actively resist
wasteful spending, the unrestrained growth of the military--industrial
complex, and the production of militaristic propaganda, we should not
assume that all civil--military relationships are harmful.]{.underline}
Drone technologies have been characterized by a high degree of
civil--military interaction and yet much of that interaction seems to be
benign and insufficient to suggest that there is something morally
objectionable about drones.

#### Straight turn---this is inevitable and they don't solve---[but]{.underline}, LAWs do!

**Schulzke, 16**---assistant professor in International Relations at the
University of York (Marcus, "The Moral Landscape of Drone Warfare," *The
Morality of Drone Warfare and the Politics of Regulation*, Chapter 2, pg
55-78, SpringerLink, dml)

[A]{.underline} related [concern]{.underline} about drones [is
that]{.underline} they may raise new prospects for manipulating the
civilian public. [Because drones **mediate** war]{.underline}, placing
machines between the human opponents on either side, [they could
**arguably** be used to create a **distorted view** of what war is like
and what its effects are. This mediated vision of war could also
**influence**]{.underline} civilian [**audiences' attitudes**
about]{.underline} drones or about [war in general by making it easier
to selectively present information about how attacks are carried out and
what costs they have. Civilians could not only be **prevented** from
seeing]{.underline} the [unfortunate consequences]{.underline} drone
strikes may have on innocent people [but might also be **distracted**
from ever engaging in **critical inquiry**]{.underline} by the flashy
videos of drones launching precise attacks against enemy military
targets. Moreover, this influence could arguably be enacted via the kind
of civil--military technology sharing I discussed in the previous
section as civilian media producers are often complicit in creating the
military spectacles for civilian audiences. 13

This concern is probably most effectively and famously expressed by
James Der Derian in his discussion of the concept of **[virtuous
war]{.underline}**. 14 Der Derian does not focus on drones, but rather
objects to a pervasive tendency in the representation of war that drones
and other precision weapons participate in. As he sees it, contemporary
wars and representations of war are marked by the logic of 'virtuous
war,' which [is a way of showing the action of combat **without the
consequences**]{.underline}. Details like dead bodies, displaced
populations, and ruined infrastructures are omitted to give the
appearance that war is a relatively clean and casualty-free activity.
[This is a trend Der Derian thinks is]{.underline} increasing and that
is [closely related to **robotic weapons**]{.underline}. As he says,
'\[t\]he low risk, high yield strategy of virtuous war has a logic of
its own, in which the human role is shrinking in numbers and
significance in an increasingly robotic battlespace.' 15

Many [others have expressed similar concerns]{.underline}, either by
relying explicitly on the concept of virtuous war or by developing other
accounts [of the underlying phenomenon of the **sanitization of
war**]{.underline}. Stahl highlights the extent to which drones are part
of a larger process of merging entertainment and war, [with the result
that **civilian culture becomes militarized**]{.underline}. He argues
that militainment has expanded dramatically in recent decades and has
become more insidious as it has shifted from treating audiences as
passive spectators to treating them like 'virtual citizen-soldiers' who
are active participants in simulated wars. For Stahl, drones are
particularly important in this process because they make it possible to
wage war in the manner of a 'sci-fi dystopia.' 16 [The ethical
problem]{.underline} he raises [is that militarized culture encourages
citizens, who should be **critical judges** of war, to become engaged in
**fantasies** in which they are complacent members of the
military]{.underline}. Military entertainment thus appears to be a way
of subverting democratic accountability and ensuring that citizens will
be too busy playing war to raise any concerns about real wars.

Finally, Apel argues that real information about war is presented in
carefully constructed ways that are apt to mislead viewers. 'Like video
games, the footage of war experience edited and set to music appeals to
the young and creates a decontextualized and depoliticized effect that
heightens visceral sensations while derealizing the less entertaining
effects of war.' 17 Apel cites drones as a prime example of this
tendency as she argues that videos of drone attacks posted online
glorify the strikes by showing their technical precision for those who
like to see 'things blow up without seeing the blood and gore.' 18 As
with Stahl, this characterization of the persuasive effects of media
identifies drones as being a particularly insidious tool for
manipulating civilian audiences.

Those who object to biased ways of presenting war are correct in noting
that there is something disconcerting about using drones or other
technologies to conceal the costs of fighting. [I **agree**]{.underline}
with them in thinking [that it is **unethical** to use drone footage or
other types of imagery to **deceive** the civilian public or to
**escape** regulative constraints. Citizens]{.underline} of democratic
societies [**must have access** to information about war; they need
reliable information to make reasonable decisions about whether to
support military actions]{.underline}, weapons procurements, [and the
policymakers who are responsible for making military
policy]{.underline}. Without this information citizens may not be able
to exert the pressure on elected officials that is essential for
maintaining popular sovereignty. **[Nevertheless]{.underline}**, as with
the other problems I have discussed, [this critique is an instance of
legitimate fears being **poorly framed**]{.underline}.

[This objection]{.underline}, like so many of the other criticisms
raised against drones, [picks out a **few possible misuses** of drones
while **ignoring** the many ways in which drones might be used
**responsibly**. It is true that drones **could** hide the costs of
war]{.underline} from drone operators or the general public, and that
some videos may have had this effect because they were carefully edited
or framed inaccurately. [But]{.underline} as I will discuss later, [it
is **also possible** for drones to be used to provide **more accurate
information** and **increase government accountability**. Drones **do
not simply increase** the prospects for dissimulation. Rather, they
increase the prospects for dissimulation while **also**, and
**unavoidably**, raising **unprecedented prospects** for accurately
representing war. They may be used to **mislead** or to **inform**.
Deciding which role they play is a **political challenge**]{.underline}
that is best approached through the kinds of regulations I will discuss
later. In particular, [the possibility that drones may distort war
highlights the importance of having **independent oversight** of drone
use]{.underline} and ensuring that members of the military are not able
to alter the videos before they are reviewed by oversight bodies.

**[Most weapons]{.underline}** of modern warfare [conceal the casualties
they inflict]{.underline}. In fact, [this critique of drones could be
applied **more accurately** to the many weapons that not only **fail**
to show the consequences of their use under certain conditions but may
not even be **able** to show those consequences under ideal conditions.
Bombers, artillery, mortars, and landmines are **regularly** used
against unseen enemies **without producing records** of their
consequences]{.underline}. That is to say, [they **naturally hide** the
costs they inflict even under **ideal conditions** because video records
are not a **normal by-product** of operating these weapons. Policymakers
and]{.underline} members of [the military may **sometimes** hide the
costs of drone strikes, but they do this **despite** the fact that the
mediated nature of drone operations makes them **naturally amenable** to
creating video records. Drones' latent potentials **do not increase the
scope** of immoral conduct]{.underline} ([the concealment of
war]{.underline}), [but **do significantly increase** the opportunities
for **disseminating information** about war. We **should not condemn**
drones for the misuse of the video records]{.underline}. Rather, [we
should recognize that drones **increase the prospects** of making
battlefields more transparent and **condemn** the people who **fail to
take advantage** of this capacity]{.underline}.

### AT: War On Terror

#### War on terror narratives scapegoat drone warfare and drones' reduction in casualties

**Shulzke 17** -- *Lecturer in International Relations at the University
of York, UK, PhD in Political Science from the University at Albany,
State University of New York, US, in 2013 with a dissertation on how
soldiers make ethical decisions during counterinsurgency operations.*

[It is wrong to assume that drones will always be used as they have been
during the War on Terror]{.underline}, especially when they are operated
by other armed forces or when different types of drones are deployed.
[Drones are not the cause of the US military's controversial style of
targeted killing or its geographically unrestricted
counterterrorism/counterinsurgency operations]{.underline}. Rather,
[they are one symptom of the American strategy of waging the War on
Terror by any means available]{.underline}. UAVs fulfill a particular
need---a need to carry out covert strikes against suspected terrorists
and insurgents with minimal risk to US military personnel---and they are
not alone in doing this. [Special operations forces, private military
contractors, cruise missiles, and cyber weapons can likewise be used to
fulfill this need]{.underline}. [UAVs may be more effective than these
other means of attack insofar as they present lower risk to
combatants]{.underline} than those associated with special operations
missions and contractors and are more effective in targeting specific
individuals than cruise missiles and cyber weapons, [yet they are part
of a range of weapons and tactics that are used for similar
purposes]{.underline} and that do [not necessarily have to be used as
they have been by the US military]{.underline}.

In a study of US military's special operations tactics, Niva correctly
notes that '[\[d\]rones...are a synecdoche for a bigger issue: the
expanding system of a high-tempo regime of targeted strikes, special
operations forces raids, and detention practices that are largely
unaccountable to the public and draped in secrecy rule]{.underline}s.' 1
Niva's assessment is apt, not only because he identifies the extent to
which the controversial strategies for employing UAVs are symptomatic of
larger strategic decisions but also in thinking that [the root cause of
these strategies is the lack of accountability and transparency. To
these problems one should also add that the American strategies for
waging the War on Terror are marred by inattention to state
sovereignty,]{.underline} reliance on dubious targeting strategies, [and
disturbingly close relations between the military and intelligence
services, especially the Central Intelligence Agency.]{.underline} UAVs
certainly play an important part in waging the War on Terror and have
been involved in attacks that are morally and legally questionable.
However, [the proliferation of tools for carrying out these questionable
attacks is evidence that they are not necessarily connected to
drones.]{.underline}

As we saw in the previous chapter, [drones have broad latent
potentials.]{.underline} The morality of drones is best evaluated in
terms of whether these potentials increase or decrease the scope of
ethical and unethical conduct. To say that UAVs can perform the same
functions as cruise missiles, special operations forces, and other
weapons and tactics does not excuse the misuse of UAVs in a particular
context, yet it does show that UAVs' latent potentials do not seem to
have caused any significant change in how the US military operates. [If
UAVs did not exist, then it seems unlikely that targeted killings in
Pakistan and elsewhere would simply stop. They might happen on a reduced
scale, but would likely be performed by cruise missiles and special
operations forces---a shift in tactics that might also produce **greater
numbers of** American and **civilian casualties.**]{.underline}

Thus far, [UAVs have only been used to replace humans and manned
vehicles in missions that were **already being carried
out**]{.underline} [and have followed a developmental path that reflects
the strategic goals of the USA]{.underline}. At the same time, [drones
have helped to promote a more ethically sensitive way of performing
these missions]{.underline}. A cruise missile and a UAV may both be used
to destroy the home of a suspected terrorist, yet [a UAV can monitor the
home for hours and help to ensure that the attack only comes when the
terrorist's civilian family members leave the building]{.underline}.
Drones do not guarantee that attacks are only launched when civilians
are a safe distance away---they may be used indiscriminately, just as
any other weapons may be---but [drones expand the potential for acting
with much greater respect for civilians]{.underline}. In other words,
[even when UAVs are misused in the War on Terror, we should condemn
those misuses while still recognizing that we are only objecting to
specific practices of employing UAVs]{.underline} and that alternative
methods for targeting suspected terrorists may be considerably worse.

For evidence that [we should avoid conflating certain uses of drones
with drone technology itself,]{.underline} one need look no further than
the operations that have been conducted by the US military. The [strikes
that attract criticism are almost invariably targeted killings, and not
the hundreds of ground support missions that drones have been involved
in.]{.underline} The [ground support operations are fairly unproblematic
from a moral and legal perspective]{.underline}. These are an
[established part of war and are usually conducted against people who
are clearly combatants because they are actively fighting.]{.underline}
The fact that critics generally reserve their negative evaluations for
targeted killings while saying little or nothing against drones in more
conventional military roles reveals that t[he underlying moral concern
is with the practice of targeted killings and associated actions like
infringing on the sovereignty of foreign states or conducting military
operations outside of war]{.underline}. Conversely, [targeted killings
involving other methods, such as the special operations raid that killed
Osama Bin Laden or the cruise missile strikes on Al Qaeda training
facilities in 1998, have been contentious because they target
individuals or violate state sovereignty and **not because of the
methods employed**.]{.underline} With this in mind, we can advance the
debate over drone warfare by drawing a clearer distinction between
drones and the countless different ways in which they can be used.

### Aff---AT: Human in the Loop

#### "Human in the loop" dehumanizes the victims of LAW attacks and defers to IR paradigms that justify violence against the "non-West"

**Williams 21** -- *Professor of International Relations at Durham
University (UK), PhD, Politics and International Studies (*John,
December 2021, "Locating LAWS: Lethal Autonomous Weapons, Epistemic
Space, and 'Meaningful Human' Control," *Journal of Global Security
Studies*, Volume 6, Issue 4, ogab015,
https://doi.org/10.1093/jogss/ogab015)//KH

[The epistemic paradigm of MHC emerging from Cold War experience sets
the strategic agenda for analyzing LAWS.]{.underline} However, that
experience is not characteristic of Western uses of force in the past
250 years. [War has colonized non-European political communities,
enabled slavery, eliminated indigenous peoples, imposed forms of
economic interaction, and suppressed political opposition to established
authorities most conducive to European governments, their settler
colonies, or trading corporations.]{.underline} Predominant forms and
[experiences of military violence are marginalized]{.underline}.
[**IR\'s disciplinary intellectual history** bears **significant**
responsibility]{.underline} because [it **ignores non-Western
traditions** of thought]{.underline} (Blaney and Tickner 2017),
non-Western histories (Buzan and Lawson 2015; Acharya and Buzan 2019),
non-Western experience (Phillips 2014, 2016), and [occludes its
indebtedness to discriminatory and racist concepts and
theories]{.underline} (Hobson 2004, 2012; Vitalis 2015). While
non-Western states raise issues of strategic stability (e.g., Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela on Behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and Other
Parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons 2018, para.
4(f)), arms races, and discriminatory export controls (Brazil 2019a) in
the CCW GGE, these remain within the epistemic space defined by
particular and selective Euro-Atlantic-centric accounts. Engaging
richer, and more honest, military and strategic history is the first
research agenda item and one also applicable to international law and
ethics, and engineering and technology policy as shown below.

[The ideal-type "meaningful human" to control LAWS carries these
legacies unnoticed and unquestioned]{.underline}. [They are a
"**meaningful human**" privileged by centuries of **violently oppressing
non-Western** and non-white people]{.underline}, and [legitimized by an
ostensible strategic stability that rested on decades of Cold War
violence fought out at the costs of millions of lives in proxy wars,
coups, insurgencies, and dictatorships air-brushed from this
debate.]{.underline} The ostensible [neutrality of "human" and
"humanity" in MHC instantiates this intellectual tunnel vision about
security.]{.underline} Those [categories **cannot escape** this
epistemological legacy]{.underline}. To be a "meaningful human" able to
exercise "[meaningful control" assumes acceptance of this
framing.]{.underline} "[Meaningful" exists within this
paradigm]{.underline} that portrays the absence of general, system-wide
war since 1945 as the product of astute great power management[, led by
the West]{.underline}. "[Control" must]{.underline} therefore
[contribute to reducing the dangers of destabilizing this]{.underline}
delicately poised, but supposedly universally beneficial, [management
system.]{.underline} This is not to dismiss the potential severity of
strategic destabilization or increased escalatory risks dominating the
IR and security studies aspects of MHC debates. It is, though, to call
for critical engagement with the selective history that is called upon
as evidence of these risks and how to manage them, and of the
epistemological assumptions about "rationality" that create the
"meaningful human" who is both reference point for and idealized
exerciser of "meaningful control."

The [post-9/11 security debate reinforces this **epistemological
privileging**, showing how non-Western space and those who exploit it
are the source of insecurity]{.underline}. This ties in to [the
development of a key precursor technology for LAWS, armed drones, as
critical to **exercising control** over "dangerous" space]{.underline}.
For example, the United States portrays "[un-governed,"
"under-governed," or "ill-governed" space]{.underline} as key threats.
[This is where transnational terrorists will inevitably
gather,]{.underline} exploiting opportunities to train, organize, and
plan attacks against the west. This [narrative, present in **every US
National Security Strategy** since 2001]{.underline} (United States
2002, 10--11, 2006, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 2010, 8, 19, 20, 2015, 9, 10--11,
26, 2017, 10, 11, 48), ostensibly [necessitates penetrating these spaces
for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
purposes]{.underline}, in preparation [for potential strike operations
to "disrupt," "dismantle," "degrade," "destroy," or "defeat"
transnational terrorist organizations]{.underline} (on multiple
three-fold permutations of these "\'D"s, see Page 2016). [Presenting
such organizations as "**cancers,"** or other **dehumanizing tropes**,
is widespread, reinforcing these threats as inescapable and
necessitating action]{.underline} (e.g., Obama 2014; Cameron 2015; Price
2019).

[Drones,]{.underline} and their complex supporting infrastructure, [have
become central to US practice in places including Pakistan, Afghanistan,
Somalia, Libya, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen]{.underline}. [A dangerous
"non-West]{.underline}," often [invoking colonialist cultural
tropes]{.underline} (Neocleous 2013; Satia 2014), is the source of
threats, destabilization, and terror. [What the "West" did to them in
the past]{.underline} and which [may help explain hostility and distrust
is forgotten]{.underline}. [Management to protect Western
interests]{.underline} through military force [is
essential.]{.underline} The histories, experiences, perspectives, and
[epistemologies of people subjected to such violence are fundamentally
irrelevant]{.underline}. [They may be "objects" of
violence,]{.underline} including the violence inflicted on them [by
terrorist and insurgent groups]{.underline}, but in thinking about the
lessons of drone use [for MHC, there is no sign such experiences and
perspectives have anything significant to say about what "meaningful"
control might entail]{.underline} from the position of those who are
most likely to experience Counterinsurgency (COIN) and Counter-Terrorism
(CT) uses of LAWS. **[These people are not "meaningful
humans."]{.underline}**

Summarizing Cold War and post-9/11 influences on LAWS debates shows the
epistemological privileging of Western IR and security expertise is
ubiquitous. [Defense and security "experts" are the "meaningful humans"
able to exercise appropriate contro]{.underline}l. Expertise arises
from, and is judged against, this framework and through the exercise of
technical competence in understanding the framework\'s components. For
example, authoritative interpretation of key reference points are
claimed for US military authorities: Pentagon doctrine captures "the
perceptions of practitioners across the globe," and [**former senior US
officers are definitive interpreters of Clausewitz** as the canonical
theorist of war]{.underline} (Kirkpatrick 2016; Jensen, Whyte, and Cuomo
2020, 527). The [relevant expert constituency are political and military
leaders making decisions about which systems to develop, how to
integrate them within existing armed forces structures, when to deploy
them to the field, and how to evaluate their contribution]{.underline}.
Current [efforts to quantify the effectiveness of "decapitation" drone
strikes against terrorist and insurgent groups]{.underline} (e.g.,
Johnston 2012; Price 2012; Johnston and Sarbahi 2016; Rigterink 2020[)
focus on whether and to what extent LAWS reduce risks to
"us."]{.underline} When Roff and Danks (2018, 2) offer a neglected view,
it remains a Western one: "[The debate about autonomous weapons systems
\... overlook\[s\] \... how such systems \... will affect those
individuals they are supposed to help:]{.underline} the warfighters."
These are exclusively the warfighters of armed forces that match the
blueprint of advanced industrial democracies, and key official reference
points come from the US Airforce and the US Department of Defense.

### Aff---AT: Schulzke 

#### Schulzke only considers unrealistic moral fantasies!

**Archambault 21** -- *MPhil in International Political Theory from the
University of St Andrews and a Bachelors in Liberal Arts from Concordia
University, Montreal, PhD Candidate at the School of Government and
International Affairs at the University of Durham* (Emil, November 26,
2021, "Review Essay: A good guy with a drone: On the ethics of drone
warfare," Contemporary political theory., 19 (S3). pp. 169-175,
https://doi.org/10.1057/s41296-019-00328-w)//KH

Throughout, [Schulzke argues largely by refutation, drawing on a large
number of critiques of drones to establish the value of his approach
separating the weapon from practices of war]{.underline}, [which would
be problematic for all forms of warfare,]{.underline} not merely drone
warfare. In so doing, however, [he narrows the scope of his
study:]{.underline} despite two chapters on the jus ad bellum (one on
the ethical challenges of drones, and one on the potential regulation of
drone use to strengthen ethical compliance), [Schulzke's vision is one
where the availability of weapons systems bears no influence on the
decision to use military force.]{.underline} He therefore [rejects
outright any argument to the effect that drones may encourage the use of
military force]{.underline}, or that their secrecy may lead to more
extensive uses of force. To the extent that these may constitute valid
concerns, they can be remedied by a strengthening of ethical norms
against aggression, by an emphasis on the need for a just cause, and by
norms on domestic and international transparency, and therefore do not
pose a particular challenge to drones themselves.

Neither of the books under consideration argues that drones are, in
themselves, inherently and irredeemably immoral. As mentioned above, for
[Schulzke, drones are 'defensible weapons platforms', which can be
deemed ethical only in their use or misuse]{.underline} (p. 12).
Furthermore, [because any weapon (except for WMDs) can be used for
either ethical or unethical conduct, any evidence of negligence causing
excessive collateral damage, or even of deliberate war crimes through
drones cannot be used as evidence of their problematic
morality]{.underline}. [Drones]{.underline}, however, [do change moral
calculation by enabling further ethical conduct. By removing combatants
from the battlefield and thus removing the justification for
self-defence, by lowering the costs of restraint]{.underline} -- i.e. by
reducing the risk that spared enemies might attack friendly forces --
[and by allowing for the positive identification of targets through
loitering and advanced visual capabilities]{.underline}, Schulzke states
that drones present the ability to strengthen rules of engagement and
tolerate little to no risk of collateral damage (p. 117).

[In so arguing, however, **Schulzke finds himself in a double
bind**]{.underline}. First, as Martin notes, [these capabilities can
hardly be described as moral 'advantages' (p. 173) outside of their use
in practice.]{.underline} Thus, Martin argues, [the 'paradox' may well
be that these seeming benefits of drones will simultaneously lead to
more pervasive legal violations]{.underline} (p. 39). As Megan Braun and
Brunstetter note, [a high proportion of targeted killing strikes lead to
civilian deaths, more so than with other weapons systems]{.underline}
(Braun and Brunstetter, cited by Brunstetter and Jimenez, p. 83). [Short
of considering the practices in which these drones are used, therefore,
Schulzke's moral advantages remain little more than
hypothetical.]{.underline} Furthermore, as Derek Gregory has
demonstrated -- and Martin mentions (p. 54) -- visual acuity does not
equal understanding of a situation and [distance does not equal
detachment, leading potentially to violations of principles of just
war]{.underline} (Gregory, 2018; see also Williams, 2015).

#### Schulzke falls prey to the bio-politicization of ethics of violence by skirting questions of us and effectiveness

**Archambault 21** -- *MPhil in International Political Theory from the
University of St Andrews and a Bachelors in Liberal Arts from Concordia
University, Montreal, PhD Candidate at the School of Government and
International Affairs at the University of Durham* (Emil, November 26,
2021, "Review Essay: A good guy with a drone: On the ethics of drone
warfare," Contemporary political theory., 19 (S3). pp. 169-175,
https://doi.org/10.1057/s41296-019-00328-w)//KH

Drones, for Schulzke, are not responsible for the wider character of
war: 'Drones are not the cause of the US military's controversial style
of targeted killing or its geographically unrestrained
counterterrorism/counterinsurgency operations. Rather, they are one
symptom of the American strategy of waging the War on Terror by any
means available' (p. 57). [The point is well taken that drones do not,
in themselves, create the necessity for their use]{.underline}. It is
equally correct that drones are part of an array of tactics -- special
forces raids, conventional aerial bombing, cruise missile strikes -- and
that a rejection of drone strikes would not mean an end to targeted
killing (p. 58). [However, in separating these two elements, Schulzke
brackets off a crucial question, namely whether the availability of
drones **creates pressures for their use.**]{.underline} Boyle, in
comparison, openly inquires whether the ubiquity of drones may lead to
the normalization of targeted killing, and whether the proliferation of
technology may lead to a proliferation of norms enabling drone use (p.
16). Carvin, as well as Brunstetter and Jimenez, note how technological
innovations can create pressures leading to changes in laws of war and
human rights (Carvin, p. 26; Brunstetter and Jimenez, p. 88). Schulzke
seeks to present drones as morally advantageous weapons by dismissing
cursorily any suggestion that drones may impact the wider character of
war and the norms governing it. Would the United States have pursued a
strategy of targeted killing without drones[? Would they have opted, as
Schulzke suggests, for a more destructive strategy (p. 177)? At any
rate, such questions deserve careful consideration, not summary
dismissal.]{.underline}

[Schulzke, therefore, falls prey to what Elke Schwarz criticizes as the
biopoliticization of ethics of violence, that is, the transformation of
ethics from a judgment to a code that can be applied blindly, in a
calculating fashion, leading to 'narrowed horizons for ethical
debate']{.underline} (Schwarz, 2018, p. 172). [Ethics,]{.underline}
therefore, [in Schwarz's account, is transformed by violent
technologies]{.underline} from an inquiry [into whether it is right to
kill into a technological endeavour to kill more
effectively]{.underline} (Schwarz, 2018, pp. 191, 198). It is
particularly [jarring that Schulzke asserts the heightened ability of
drones for proportionality]{.underline} (both ad bellum and in bello)
[while excluding the question of whether drones can achieve a given
objective]{.underline} (p. 189). Carvin argues that 'good inquiry about
drones will focus on overall strategy', including 'second- and
third-order effects' (p. 33). Indeed, what Carvin highlights here is
that it is impossible to discuss the proportionality of military actions
effectively without a consideration of their role vis-a\`-vis strategic
objectives (and whether any tactical action furthers this strategic
objective). In other words, if targeted killings can be shown to be
effective in increasing security and defeating the given enemy, then
considerations of how to pursue this strategy better become relevant,
and Schulzke's discussion becomes highly pertinent. [If, however,
targeted killings do not, in fact, further the pursuit of strategic
objectives, then discussions of whether drones allow for more
discriminatory killing become moot, as the requisite level of
proportionality (both in bello and ad bellum) may never be
established.]{.underline}

## NATO Good

### Ukraine---1NC

#### Critiques of American power ignore that the realistic alternatives are worse. Invasion of Ukraine proves.

**Kagan 22 -- **Senior Fellow with the Project on International Order
and Strategy in the Foreign Policy Program at Brookings. \[Robert. "The
Price of Hegemony: Can America Learn to Use Its Power?" Foreign Affairs,
The World After the War, May/June 2022. June 1, 2022.\]

But although this massive change had little to do with U.S. policies, it
had much to do with the reality of the United States' post--Cold War
hegemony. **[Many Americans tend to equate hegemony with imperialism,
but the two are different.]{.underline}** [Imperialism is an active
effort by one state to force others into its sphere, whereas hegemony is
more a condition than a purpose. A militarily, economically, and
culturally powerful country exerts influence on other states by its mere
presence, the way a larger body in space affects the behavior of smaller
bodies through its gravitational pull.]{.underline} Even if the United
States was not aggressively expanding its influence in Europe, and
certainly not through its military, the collapse of Soviet power
enhanced the attractive pull of the United States and its democratic
allies. Their prosperity, their freedom, and, yes, their power to
protect former Soviet satellites, when combined with the inability of
Moscow to provide any of these, dramatically shifted the balance in
Europe in favor of Western liberalism to the detriment of Russian
autocracy. [The growth of U.S. influence and the spread of liberalism
were less a policy objective of the United States than the natural
consequence of that shift.]{.underline}

Russian leaders could have accommodated themselves to this new reality.
Other great powers had adjusted to similar changes. The British had once
been lords of the seas, the possessors of a vast global empire, and the
center of the financial world. Then they lost it all. But although some
were humiliated at being supplanted by the United States, Britons rather
quickly adjusted to their new place in the firmament. The French, too,
lost a great empire, and Germany and Japan, defeated in war, lost
everything except their talent for producing wealth. But they all made
the adjustment and were arguably better for it.

There were certainly Russians in the 1990s---Yeltsin's foreign minister,
Andrei Kozyrev, for one---who thought that Russia should make a similar
decision. They wished to integrate Russia into the liberal West even at
the expense of traditional geopolitical ambitions. But that was not the
view that ultimately prevailed in Russia. Unlike the United Kingdom,
France, and to some extent Japan, Russia did not have a long history of
friendly relations and strategic cooperation with the United
States---quite the contrary. Unlike Germany and Japan, Russia was not
militarily defeated, occupied, and reformed in the process. And unlike
Germany, which always knew that its economic power was irrepressible and
that in the post--World War II order it could at least grow prosperous,
Russia never really believed it could become a successful economic
powerhouse. [Its elites thought that the likeliest consequence of
integration would be Russia's demotion to, at best, a second-rank power.
Russia would be at peace, and it would still have a chance to prosper.
But it would not determine the fate of Europe and the
world.]{.underline}

WAR OR PEACE

In the fall of 1940, Japan's foreign minister, Yosuke Matsuoka, posed
his country's predicament starkly in a meeting with other senior
officials. Japan could seek a return to cooperative relations with the
United States and the United Kingdom, he noted, but only on those
countries' terms. This meant returning to "little Japan," as the
minister of war (and future prime minister), General Hideki Tojo, put
it. To Japanese leaders at the time, that seemed intolerable, so much so
that they risked a war that most of them believed they were likely to
lose. The coming years would prove not only that going to war was a
mistake but also that the Japanese would indeed have served their
interests better by simply integrating themselves into the liberal order
from the beginning, as they did quite successfully after the war.

[Putin's Russia has made much the same choice as did imperial Japan,
Kaiser Wilhelm II's Germany, and many other dissatisfied powers
throughout history, and likely with the same end---eventual
defeat.]{.underline} But **[Putin's choice should hardly have come as a
surprise]{.underline}**. Washington's protestations of goodwill, the
billions of dollars it poured into the Russian economy, the care it took
in the early post--Cold War years to avoid dancing on the Soviet Union's
grave---all this had no effect, because what Putin wanted could not be
granted by the United States[. He sought to reverse a defeat that could
not be reversed without violent force, but he lacked the wherewithal to
wage a successful war. He wanted to restore a Russian sphere of interest
in central and eastern Europe that Moscow had lost the power to
sustain.]{.underline}

[The problem for Putin---and for those in the West who want to cede to
both China and Russia their traditional spheres of interest---is that
such spheres are not granted to one great power by other great powers;
they are not inherited, nor are they created by geography or history or
"tradition." They are acquired by economic, political, and military
power]{.underline}. They come and go as the distribution of power in the
international system fluctuates. The United Kingdom's sphere of interest
once covered much of the globe, and France once enjoyed spheres of
interest in Southeast Asia and much of Africa and the Middle East. Both
lost them, partly due to an unfavorable shift of power at the beginning
of the twentieth century, partly because their imperial subjects
rebelled, and partly because they willingly traded in their spheres of
interest for a stable and prosperous U.S.-dominated peace. Germany's
sphere of interest once extended far to the east. Before World War I,
some Germans envisioned a vast economic Mitteleuropa, where the people
of central and eastern Europe would provide the labor, resources, and
markets for German industry. But this German sphere of interest
overlapped with Russia's sphere of interest in southeastern Europe,
where Slavic populations looked to Moscow for protection against
Teutonic expansion. These contested spheres helped produce both world
wars, just as the contested spheres in East Asia had helped bring Japan
and Russia to blows in 1904.

[Russians may believe they have a natural, geographic, and historical
claim to a sphere of interest in eastern Europe because they had it
throughout much of the past four centuries. And many Chinese feel the
same way about East Asia, which they once dominated. But even the
Americans learned that claiming a sphere of interest is different from
having one]{.underline}. For the first century of the United States'
existence, [the Monroe Doctrine was a mere assertion---as hollow as it
was brazen. It was only toward the end of the nineteenth century, when
the country was able to enforce its claim, that the other great powers
were grudgingly forced to accept it]{.underline}. After the Cold War,
Putin and other Russians may have wanted the West to grant Moscow a
sphere of interest in Europe, but such a sphere simply did not reflect
the true balance of power after the Soviet Union fell. China may claim
the "nine-dash line"---enclosing most of the South China Sea---as
marking its sphere of interest, but until Beijing can enforce it, other
powers are unlikely to acquiesce.

Some Western analysts nonetheless argued when the Cold War ended, and
continue to argue now, that Washington and western Europe should have
given in to Russia's demand. [But if Moscow could not enforce a sphere,
then on what grounds should the West have acceded? Fairness? Justice?
**Spheres of interest are not about justice, and even if they were,
consigning the Poles and other eastern Europeans to subservience to
Moscow would have been a dubious justice. They knew what it was like to
be under Moscow's sway---the loss of independence, the imposition of
rulers willing to take direction from the Kremlin, the squelching of
individual liberties. The only way they would have accepted a return to
Russia's sphere was if they were compelled to by a combination of
Russian pressure and the studied indifference of the
West.**]{.underline}

In fact, [even if the United States had vetoed the accession of Poland
and others to NATO, as some suggested at the time that it should have,
the Balts, the Czechs, the Hungarians, and the Poles would have done
everything they could to integrate themselves into the transatlantic
community in every other possible way]{.underline}. [They would have
worked to join the global economy, to enter other Western-dominated
international institutions, and to gain whatever commitment they could
to their security---]{.underline}acts that almost certainly would have
still antagonized Moscow. Once Putin began taking slices out of Ukraine
(there would be no way for him to restore Russia to its previous
great-power status without controlling Ukraine), the Poles and others
would have come banging on NATO's door. It seems unlikely that the
United States and its allies would have continued to say no.

[Russia's problem was ultimately not just about its military weakness.
Its problem was, and remains, its weakness in all relevant forms of
power, including the power of attraction]{.underline}. At least during
the Cold War, a communist Soviet Union could claim to offer the path to
paradise on earth. Yet afterward, Moscow could provide neither ideology,
nor security, nor prosperity, nor independence to its neighbors. **[It
could offer only Russian nationalism and ambition, and eastern Europeans
understandably had no interest in sacrificing themselves on that
altar]{.underline}**. If there was any other choice, Russia's neighbors
were bound to take it. And there was: the United States and its strong
alliance, merely by existing, merely by being rich and powerful and
democratic, offered a very good choice indeed.

Putin may want to see the United States as being behind all his
troubles, and he is right that the country's attractive power closed the
door to some of his ambitions. But the real sources of his problems are
the limitations of Russia itself and the choices that he has made not to
accept the consequences of a power struggle that Moscow legitimately
lost. Post--Cold War Russia, like Weimar Germany, never suffered an
actual military defeat and occupation, an experience that might have
produced a transformation of the sort that occurred in post--World War
II Germany and Japan. Like the Weimar Republic, Russia was therefore
susceptible to its own "stab-in-the-back myth" about how Russian leaders
supposedly betrayed the country to the West. But although Russians can
cast blame in any number of directions---at Gorbachev, at Yeltsin, and
at Washington---the fact is that Russia enjoyed neither the wealth and
power nor the geographic advantages of the United States, and it was
therefore never suited to be a global superpower. Moscow's efforts to
sustain that position ultimately bankrupted its system financially and
ideologically---as may well be happening again.

SOONER OR LATER

Observers used to say that Putin played a bad hand skillfully. It [is
true that he read the United States and its allies correctly for many
years, pushing forward just enough to achieve limited goals without
sparking a dangerous reaction from the West, up until this latest
invasion.]{.underline} But even so, he had help from the United States
and its allies, which played a strong hand poorly. Washington and Europe
stood by as Putin increased Russian military capabilities, and they did
little as [he probed and tested Western resolve, first in Georgia in
2008 and then in Ukraine in 2014. They didn't act when Putin
consolidated Russia's position in Belarus or when he established a
robust Russian presence in Syria, from which his weapons could reach the
southeastern flank of NATO]{.underline}. [And if his "special military
operation" in Ukraine had gone as planned, with the country subdued in a
matter of days, it would have been a triumphant coup, the end of the
first stage of Russia's comeback and the beginning of the
second]{.underline}. **[Rather than excoriating him for his inhumane
folly, the world would again be talking about Putin's "savvy" and his
"genius."]{.underline}**

Thankfully, that was not to be. But now that Putin has made his
mistakes, the question is whether the United States will continue to
make its own mistakes or whether Americans will learn, once again, that
it is better to contain aggressive autocracies early, before they have
built up a head of steam and the price of stopping them rises. [The
challenge posed by Russia is neither unusual nor irrational. The rise
and fall of nations is the warp and woof of international
relations.]{.underline} National trajectories are changed by wars and
the resulting establishment of new power structures, by shifts in the
global economy that enrich some and impoverish others, and by beliefs
and ideologies that lead people to prefer one power over another. [If
there is any blame to be cast on the United States for what is happening
in Ukraine, it is not that Washington deliberately extended its
influence in eastern Europe]{.underline}. It is that Washington failed
to see that its influence had already increased and to anticipate that
actors dissatisfied with the liberal order would look to overturn it.

For the 70-plus years since World War II, the United States has actively
worked to keep revisionists at bay. But many Americans hoped that with
the end of the Cold War, this task would be finished and that their
country could become a "normal" nation with normal---which was to say,
limited---global interests**[. But the global hegemon cannot tiptoe off
the stage, as much as it might wish to. It especially cannot retreat
when there are still major powers that, because of their history and
sense of self, cannot give up old geopolitical ambitions---unless
Americans are prepared to live in a world shaped and defined by those
ambitions, as it was in the 1930s.]{.underline}**

Americans are part of a never-ending power struggle, whether they wish
to be or not.

[**The United States would be better served if it recognized both its
position in the world and its true interest in preserving the liberal
world order**. In the case of Russia, this would have meant doing
everything possible to integrate it into the liberal order politically
and economically while deterring it from attempting to re-create its
regional dominance by military means.]{.underline} The commitment to
defend NATO allies was never meant to preclude helping others under
attack in Europe, as the United States and its allies did in the case of
the Balkans in the 1990s, and the United States and its allies could
have resisted military efforts to control or seize land from Georgia and
Ukraine. [Imagine if the United States and the democratic world had
responded in 2008 or 2014 as they have responded to Russia's latest use
of force, when Putin's military was even weaker than it has proved to be
now, even as they kept extending an outstretched hand in case Moscow
wanted to grasp it]{.underline}. **[The United States ought to be
following the same policy toward China: make clear that it is prepared
to live with a China that seeks to fulfill its ambitions economically,
politically, and culturally but that it will respond effectively to any
Chinese military action against its neighbors.]{.underline}**

It is true that acting firmly in 2008 or 2014 would have meant risking
conflict. But Washington is risking conflict now; Russia's ambitions
have created an inherently dangerous situation. It is better for the
United States to risk confrontation with belligerent powers when they
are in the early stages of ambition and expansion, not after they have
already consolidated substantial gains. Russia may possess a fearful
nuclear arsenal, but the risk of Moscow using it is not higher now than
it would have been in 2008 or 2014, if the West had intervened then. And
it has always been extraordinarily small: Putin was never going to
obtain his objectives by destroying himself and his country, along with
much of the rest of the world. If the United States and its
allies---with their combined economic, political, and military
power---had collectively resisted Russian expansionism from the
beginning, Putin would have found himself constantly unable to invade
neighboring countries.

Unfortunately, it is very difficult for democracies to take action to
prevent a future crisis. The risks of acting now are always clear and
often exaggerated, whereas distant threats are just that: distant and so
hard to calculate. It always seems better to hope for the best rather
than try to forestall the worst. This common conundrum becomes even more
debilitating when Americans and their leaders remain blissfully
unconscious of the fact that they are part of a never-ending power
struggle, whether they wish to be or not.

But **[Americans should not lament the role they play in the
world]{.underline}**. [The reason the United States has often found
itself entangled in Europe, after all, is because what it offers is
genuinely attractive to much of the world---and certainly better when
compared with any realistic alternative.]{.underline} **[If Americans
learn anything from Russia's brutalization of Ukraine, it should be that
there really are worse things than U.S. hegemony]{.underline}**

### Ukraine---2NC

#### NATO support of Ukraine is good. The alternative is ruthless attacks on civilians. The Madrid Summit shows unity but more support is necessary.

**Kempe 7/2 -- **President and Chief Executive Officer of the Atlantic
Council, a nonpartisans organization that analyzes solutions to global
challenges. \[Frederick. "Op-ed: In Putin's evil vs good war against
Ukraine, the forces of good prevailed at NATO this week." CNBC. July 2,
2022.\]

[This is a story of evil versus good.]{.underline}

**[It's the story of a despot's ruthless attacks on civilian targets in
Ukraine, versus the historic, but nonetheless insufficient, rallying of
democratic states to save the country.]{.underline}**

At midday on Monday, in the central Ukrainian industrial city of
Kremenchuk, sitting serenely astride the Dnipro river, about 1,000 men,
women and children wandered the Amstor shopping mall, trying to enjoy
some normalcy amidst a brutal war.

Some 185 miles away and a few thousand feet overhead, Russian bombers
flying over Russia's Kursk region likely Tupolev Tu-22M3s, released at
least two Kh-22 medium-range, 2,000 lb. nuclear-capable cruise missiles,
developed in the 1960s to destroy aircraft carriers. An air raid siren
wailed, and Ukrainians, well-practiced in the fifth month of Russian
President Vladimir Putin's war, scrambled for safety.

Around the same time at Schloss Elmau luxury retreat in Germany's
Bavarian Alps, [the Group of Seven leaders, representing the world's
largest democracies, huddled around conference tables in an effort to
add to their far-reaching sanctions on Putin and Russia]{.underline}.
They debated options to choke the finances that fuel Putin's war,
including putting a price cap on oil sales to Russia that could reduce
the \$1 billion dollars the world pays Russia every day for energy.

As they struggled to make progress, [one of the missiles screamed down
on the shopping mall.]{.underline} A CCTV video captured a bucolic day,
with wispy clouds adorning the otherwise blue sky, and then the massive
fireball of the blast and the curling up of a gigantic black smoke
plume. Shattered glass and debris flew past the camera.

A day later, as Ukrainian officials tallied the death toll **[--- at
least 20 dead and 59 wounded in a war where Putin's military has already
killed tens, if not hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians]{.underline}**
--- [NATO leaders gathered for the summit that had brought me to Madrid.
They were abuzz about the timing of Putin's shopping mall strike,
knowing that **it was aimed as much at them as Ukraine.**]{.underline}

"Talk as much as you want," Putin seemed to be saying to them. "Sign
whatever documents you like. I'll outlast you and your spoiled societies
with my war of attrition, restoring imperial Russia and sealing my place
in history even as your decadent West continues its decay."

[Putin could be confident that despite historic agreements in Madrid
this week and even though arms deliveries from the United States and its
partners are increasing in numbers and quality, no one was yet willing
to provide the heavier, longer range, precision weaponry that could have
prevented the shopping mall strike and so many others, and might allow
an urgently needed counteroffensive.]{.underline}

**[Even so, NATO reached a level of unity unseen in more than 30
years.]{.underline}**

At the end of a marathon, hours-long negotiating session involving NATO
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Turkish President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan, Finnish President Sauli Niinistö, and Swedish Prime Minister
Magdalena Andersson, [the sides reached an agreement that cleared the
way for Finland and Sweden to join NATO]{.underline} and end, in
Sweden's case, two centuries of neutrality.

The following day **[NATO leaders would sign off on a new Strategic
Concept, highlighting Russia as their most present danger but including
China for the first time as a matter of common concern.]{.underline}**
[The leaders of Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand attended a
NATO summit for the first time as partners and guests.]{.underline}

NATO's China language signaled that the alliance understood it faced a
global and interrelated challenge. Considering that 30 countries needed
to sign off on the text, many of them still with China as their number
one trading partner, it's a powerful read.

"The People's Republic of China's stated ambitions and coercive policies
challenge our interests, security and values," it said. Later it
continues, "The PRC seeks to control key technological and industrial
sectors, critical infrastructure, and strategic minerals and supply
chains. It uses its economic leverage to create strategic dependencies
and enhance its influence. It strives to subvert the rules-based
international order, including in space, cyber and maritime domains."

[There was a lot of celebratory talk among allies about their increased
unity and deepened purpose, including President Joe Biden's declaration
that NATO was sending an "unmistakable message" to Putin.]{.underline}

Among other agreements, [NATO acted to shore up its eastern and southern
flanks, and the U.S. Army will send a corps headquarters to Poland and
more troops to the Baltics and Romania. NATO pledged to increase its
high-readiness forces from 40,000 to 300,000, even as Sweden and Finland
brought it significant new military weight.]{.underline}

Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares heralded the summit as
potentially as significant as Yalta (heaven help us) or the fall of the
Berlin Wall.

At a NATO Public Forum that the Atlantic Council co-hosted on the
margins of the summit, I asked French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna
how she would rank the historic moment.

"History will tell," she said.

[No one should miss Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's message to
G-7 leaders this week that they must provide him the means for a
counteroffensive to push back Russian troops before winter sets in and
Ukraine's allies lose interest in the face of growing economic
headwinds.]{.underline}

"Russia is waging two wars right now," writes Greg Ip in the Wall Street
Journal. "A hot war with Ukraine whose costs are measured in death and
destruction, and a cold war with the West whose costs are measured in
economic hardship and inflation."

Putin might fold over time in the face of a more determined West and
better armed Ukraine, writes Ip, but he's wagering that he can "inflict
enough short-term cost on Western consumers that political support for
Ukraine will crumble."

**[I leave Madrid encouraged by an increased consensus among European
and Asian democracies that a Ukrainian defeat would be disastrous for
Europe and world order as other despots calculate their own
opportunities.]{.underline}**

Yet I also come away discouraged that for all this week's progress, the
military support and sanctions still aren't equal to the historic
stakes.

**[In this contest between a determined despot and rallying democracies,
the forces for good had an excellent week. If they don't build upon it,
and fast, it won't be enough.]{.underline}**

## War Games Good

### Ukraine---1NC

#### The war in Ukraine proves that cyber threats are real and escalating. Wargames are crucial to hone coordination and skills. 

**Kagubare 22 --** Staff writer for The Hill specializing in technology
reporting. \[Ines. "NATO launches cyber wargame amid looming Russian
threats." The Hill. April 19, 2022.\]

[As the West braces for Russian cyberattacks amid the war in Ukraine,
NATO's Communication and Information Agency]{.underline} (NCI Agency)
[is beginning its annual Locked Shields cyber defense
simulation.]{.underline}

**[The wargame]{.underline}**, which began on Tuesday in Tallinn,
Estonia, [**will provide technical training to cyber teams from NATO
members and allies**. The teams will compete against each other in a
simulation aimed to help them understand how to best defend their
networks and critical infrastructure against cyberattacks.]{.underline}

**[The annual exercise comes at a time when NATO members are on high
alert for Russian cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure as the
war in Ukraine escalates]{.underline}**, along with diplomatic and
economic sanctions on Moscow.

"[Exercises like Locked Shields provide opportunities for both the
offense and the defense to hone their skills]{.underline}," said Michael
Daniel, president and CEO at Cyber Threat Alliance.

"**[Given the war in Ukraine and the threat posed by Russian cyber
activities, it's important for NATO to exercise its cyber
capabilities]{.underline}**," he added.

ADVERTISING

Daniel said that [although the timing of the training and the war in
Ukraine is a coincidence, the U.S. and NATO have the opportunity to
incorporate the latest Russian cyber activities into their exercises so
the participants can learn in real time.]{.underline}

James Turgal, vice president of cyber consultancy Optiv, said such
[exercises are meant to teach and train the participants on how to
anticipate the enemy's thought process and cyber tactics.]{.underline}

"[It's critical to understand where your vulnerabilities are but more
importantly how you are going to respond]{.underline}," Turgal said.

[Since the war began, Ukraine has been the target of numerous
cyberattacks that targeted its critical infrastructure and government
websites.]{.underline} Last week, Ukrainian officials said they
successfully prevented a cyberattack intended to disrupt the country's
electrical grid. Government officials said the hackers behind the attack
are affiliated with the GRU, Russia's military agency.

Earlier this month, [Microsoft said it had disrupted Russian
cyberattacks targeting Ukraine and organizations in the U.S. and the
European Union, including media outlets and policy-related institutions.
And just last month, a Google report found that Russian-backed hackers
tried to penetrate the networks of NATO, U.S.-based nongovernmental
organizations and the militaries of several European countries by
launching phishing campaigns]{.underline}.

[Finland]{.underline}, which is not a NATO member but an ally, [was also
hit with cyberattacks in early April that temporarily disrupted the
country's government websites, including the foreign and defense
ministries.]{.underline} The attack occurred while Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelensky was addressing the Finnish parliament about Russia's
invasion of his country.

James Lewis, a senior vice president and director with the strategic
technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, said that [cyberattacks targeting Estonia in 2007 were a
wake-up call for NATO, which subsequently decided to invest more in
cybersecurity.]{.underline}

In 2007, Russian-based hackers targeted Estonia with a series of
cyberattacks that hit key institutions including its foreign and defense
ministries, banks and media outlets. The attack was in response to
Estonia's decision to remove a Soviet war monument from the capital
city.

["Locked Shields is one result of the NATO response to 2007, and a big
improvement in cyber defense]{.underline}," Lewis said, adding that
**["practicing coordination before any attack is
crucial."]{.underline}**

#### Cyber games test defenses and identify vulnerabilities. That's good in the context of NATO because it increases interoperability and collective defense. 

**Stupp 22 \--** Reporter for WSJ Pro Cybersecurity at the Wall Street
Journal focusing in Cybersecurity. \[Catherine. "NATO Cyber Game Tests
Defenses Amid War in Ukraine." Wall Street Journal Pro: Cybersecurity.

NATO's large, multiday cyber defense exercise is set to bring together
technical experts from alliance countries and Ukraine nearly two months
after Russia's invasion.

[The annual cyber wargames, known as the Locked Shields exercise, will
start Tuesday in Tallinn, Estonia]{.underline}. The North Atlantic
Treaty Organization's Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence
organizes the event, which includes fictional cyberattack exercises that
test teams have to fend off under time pressure.

**[This year's competition is significant for the countries
participating because their cyber defense units have been on high alert
since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine]{.underline}**, said Anett
Numa, an international policy adviser in the cyber policy unit of
Estonia's ministry of defense.

"Like-minded countries have to work together in order to protect
themselves," Ms. Numa said. [Ukrainian and Estonian experts will work on
the same team in the exercise]{.underline}, she added.

[Finland's government websites were attacked on April 8 while the
government had been discussing joining NATO. Ukrainian government
websites were hacked in January while Russian troops gathered around the
country's borders. "Every single political decision can cause an
attack]{.underline}," Ms. Numa said, referring to current discussions in
Finland about joining NATO. Estonia also experienced a large-scale
cyberattack in 2007.

**[NATO officials have been discussing various ways the alliance could
help Ukraine fend off cyberattacks, and gave the country access to its
malware information-sharing platform in January.]{.underline}** In
February, U.S. deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging
technology Anne Neuberger, traveled to Brussels and Warsaw to discuss
Russian cyber threats with officials from NATO, the European Union,
Poland and Baltic countries.

[The NATO alliance team includes around 30 cyber defenders from
different NATO bodies and member countries with specializations such as
communications, digital forensics, legal expertise and recovering
systems damaged from an attack]{.underline}, said Ian West, chief of the
NATO Cyber Security Centre, which defends NATO networks and is a part of
the organization's communications and information agency.

**[The exercise is useful for cyber defenders from different countries
to communicate with each other about attacks on the same technology
products that several governments use]{.underline}**, Mr. West said. "We
all use commercial off-the-shelf systems. We're all using the same
technology and, as we know, many of these technologies come to market
and unfortunately they are vulnerable," he said.

R[ussia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted NATO members to upgrade their
weapons]{.underline}, deploy more troops east and possibly even welcome
more countries to the alliance. WSJ's Shelby Holliday details the three
ways the war has strengthened the NATO alliance. Photo composite:

The NATO center organizing Locked Shields doesn't make details of the
simulated cyberattacks public. [This year's exercise will focus on the
"interdependencies between national IT systems,"]{.underline} it said in
a statement. **[The wargames don't draw on elements of the recent
cyberattacks in Ukraine because those were too recent, but the exercise
generally does include scenarios that occurred in real
cyberattacks,]{.underline}** Ms. Numa said.

In 2021, more than 2,000 participants took part in a simulation that
tested how a country might respond to a large-scale cyberattack on its
financial system and keep critical functions running, such as payments.

**[The benefit of the exercises is that it sets a baseline for
participants to measure their cyber defense skills against each
other]{.underline}**, said Stefan Soesanto, a senior cyber defense
researcher at ETH Zurich.

**[The games also help experts get to know their counterparts in allied
countries,]{.underline}** he said. "They're a huge alliance with
partners behind them. If things happen, you can rely on them to assist
you," he said.

#### NATO cyber wargames are good. They help nations prepare and practice for real threats. The war in Ukraine bolsters their necessity.

started.

YAKER: We always play the, like in boxing, left and right hand. So [we
have a lot of very visible attacks. U]{.underline}sually, these are
website defacements, and [which are more of an annoyance, like drawing
attention away to do the more prepositioning for the later attacks that
the blue team most likely is not noticing yet.]{.underline}

MCLAUGHLIN: **[Everyone will notice when the attacks are really
successful. For one thing, the giant screen imitating the power grid

it into our exercise environment.

MCLAUGHLIN: [The mastermind of the exercise, Adrian Venables, says he

well before Russia invaded Ukraine.]{.underline}

ADRIAN VENABLES: [I monitor global information warfare scenarios and
real-world events, and then we incorporate them into our exercises**. So
they are absolutely real and are all inspired by what we see in today\'s

MCLAUGHLIN: [That includes hackers targeting brand-new technology, like
5G and a communication system for international banking,]{.underline}

### Cybersecurity---1NC

#### Wargames increase research and education about appropriate responses and prevent miscalculation. Critiques are based in misconceptions about cyber wargames. \*\*Schechter designs wargames, beware of bias args

**Schechter 20 --** faculty in the Strategic and Operational Research
Department at the US Naval War College, specialist in wargame design and
cybersecurity research. \[Benjamin. "Wargaming Cyber Security." War on
the Rocks. Sept 4, 2020.\]

["Wargames can save lives" is axiomatic in the wargame
community]{.underline}. But can they save your network? As modern
conflict has become increasingly digital, cyber wargaming has emerged as
an increasingly distinct and significant activity. Moreover, it's doing
double duty**[. In addition to its application to national defense, it's
also helping protect the economy and critical
infrastructure.]{.underline}** [Wargaming is a military tool used to
gain an advantage on the battlefield.]{.underline} However, it has also
found a home beyond national security, frequently used in the private
sector. Cyber security straddles the battlefield and the boardroom. As a
result, it is not surprising that cyber wargaming is increasingly common
across both the public and private sectors. As cyber security concerns
intensify, so too does the attention given to cyber wargaming.

**[Designed well and used appropriately, cyber wargames are a powerful
tool for cyber research and education.]{.underline}** **[However,
misconceptions about what cyber wargames are, their uses, and potential
abuses pose challenges to the development of cyber
wargaming]{.underline}**.

What Are Cyber Wargames?

[Cyber wargames are a specialized class of wargame about how human
decisions relate to cyber actions and effects.]{.underline} They distill
the complexities of cyberspace into a manageable and functional form,
allowing discrete elements to be studied and taught.

[They can be categorized as games with cyber and games about cyber. A
wargame with cyber may have a significant cyber component, but that is
not the wargame's focus.]{.underline} [Examples include some Department
of Defense wargames that attempt to "bolt-on" cyber operations to games
focused on conventional sea, land, and air operations]{.underline}. In
these wargames, cyberspace is just one consideration among many.
[Wargames about cyber are primarily]{.underline}, if not exclusively,
dedicated to some aspect of cyberspace, such as [investigating how
cyberspace operations impact strategic decisions.]{.underline} These are
what we often think of when we describe "cyber wargames." They run the
gambit from cyber incident response inside individual organizations to
large, interagency wargames.

**[Cyber wargames are still wargames about human
decision-making.]{.underline}** The nature of cyberspace fuels the
misconception that cyber wargames should be highly technical as well.
This error leads people to conflate several related but distinct
technical activities. For example, hands-on-keyboard events like NATO's
Locked Shields cyber exercise or other capture the flag events are
useful, but they are not wargames. Breach and attack simulations,
penetration testing, cyber range training, and even hackathons play an
important role in the cyber security ecosystem. But they shouldn't be
mistaken for wargames. There is a fine but important line between
technical exercises, training, and modeling and simulation on the one
hand, and wargames on the other.

Why Do Cyber Wargaming?

[Cyber security is hard, but cyber wargaming can help]{.underline}.
Cyberspace is a cross-cutting infrastructure upon which numerous other
infrastructures and systems now rely. It helps drive the economy, guide
weapons, deliver memes, and brings people together --- or regrettably,
drive them apart. [Listing what networked and digital information
technology has not been disrupted, transformed, or destroyed would be
easier than thinking through what has.]{.underline} As a result, we face
a sea of unknowns. What's more, the topological vastness, technological
complexity, and conceptual vagueness of this domain make cyber security
difficult to study and teach. **[The techno-mysticism and buzzwords
around cyber peace and conflict don't help. When well done, cyber
wargames can cut through this clutter, advancing education and
investigation of a dynamic subject.]{.underline}**

Like all wargames, cyber wargames can serve several different purposes
--- chiefly research and analysis, and education. The U.S. Naval War
College's 2017 Navy-Private Sector Critical Infrastructure Wargame, for
example, was a research wargame about cyber. Along with private sector
participants, it investigated the threshold at which cyber attacks
against U.S. critical infrastructure become a national security incident
and the role of government in such a crisis. Alternatively, the Atlantic
Council's Cyber 9/12 Strategy Challenge is an educational wargame
series, wherein students around the world develop competing policy
responses to fictional but realistic cyber incidents.

Despite ubiquitous workplace cyber awareness trainings, most people are
not cyber experts. Generally, people don't need deep expertise about
cyberspace any more than they need a sophisticated knowledge about
aerodynamics or epidemiology --- but a basic understanding is valuable.
This is especially true for leaders. Like it or not, "cybersecurity is
commanders' business." **[Wargames have a long history as educational
tools, and cyber wargames should be no exception.]{.underline}** [There
is a marked difference between reading about the value of allies and
partners in cyberspace and the wargaming experience of trying to secure
public and private computer networks that, for instance, connect the
United States and South Korea to Pyongyang by way of China]{.underline}.
Furthermore, **[cyber wargames provide a unique vehicle for cyber
experts and non-experts to work together towards resolving common
problems]{.underline}**, as they should in a real crisis. Wargaming
helps leaders to understand and respond to the consequential realities
about competition --- between states or businesses.

What Goes into a Cyber Wargame?

[For cyber wargames, like wargames in general, design decisions about
what to include and exclude about the digital domain have a profound
impact.]{.underline} It is impossible to include every aspect of
cyberspace in any wargame. Nor is it desirable. Instead, [good design
identifies the critical elements of cyberspace that are necessary to
address the wargame's objective]{.underline}(s) and represents them ---
and little else --- in the wargame. While a simple proposition, this is
a difficult problem in practice, given how interdependent and complex
many systems are in cyberspace. Determining what part of these complex
systems to present, and how, is typically decided on case-by-case.

McCann and March (1996: 244) next set out [the 'justification for
treating **everyday practices** as significant']{.underline} suggested
by the above literature. First, the works studied [are concerned with
proving people are not '**duped**' by their surroundings. At the level
of consciousness, subjects 'are **ironic**, **critical**, **realistic**,
even **sophisticated**']{.underline} (1996: 225). [But]{.underline}
McCann and March remind us that earlier radical or Left [theorists have
made similar arguments **without** resorting to stories of **everyday
resistance** in order to do so]{.underline}. Second, [everyday
resistance on a discursive level is said to **reaffirm the subject's
dignity**. But this too causes a **problem**]{.underline} for the
authors because [they]{.underline}:

[**query** why subversive '**assertions of self**' should
bring]{.underline} dignity and psychological [**empowerment** when
they produce **no greater material benefits** or **changes in relational
power**]{.underline} ... By standards of 'realism', ... subjects given
to avoidance and 'lumping it' may be the most sophisticated of all.
(1996: 227)

Thus, their criticism boils down to two main points. First, [[everyday
resistance **fails**]{.mark} to tell us any more about so-called **false
consciousness** than was **already known**]{.underline} among earlier
Left theorists; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} second, that a focus on
discursive resistance [**[ignores]{.mark}** the role of **[material

it would seem to the authors that '[[**powerlessness is learned** out
of]{.mark} the **accumulated experiences of [futility]{.mark}** [and
**entrapment**]{.mark}]{.underline}' (1996: 228). A lamentable prospect,
but nonetheless a source of closure for the governmentality theorist. In
his own meta-analysis of studies on resistance, Rubin (1996: 242) finds
that 'discursive [[practices]{.mark} that [neither]{.mark}
[**alter material conditions**
nor]{.mark} **directly [challenge]{.mark} broad [structures]{.mark}** are
nevertheless]{.underline}' [considered]{.underline} by the authors he
examined '[the stuff out of which [power is]{.mark} **made** and
**[remade]{.mark}**]{.underline}[']{.mark}. If this sounds familiar, it
is because the authors studied by McCann, March and Rubin found their
claims about everyday resistance on the same understanding of power and
government employed by postmodern theorists of risk. [[Arguing
**against**]{.mark} celebrating forms of [resistance that **fail to
alter**]{.mark} **broader power relations** or [**material conditions**
is]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} in part, [**[recognizing]{.mark}** the
continued '**real**' existence of **identifiable**, **[powerful
groups]{.mark}**]{.underline} (classes). In downplaying the worth of
[everyday forms of resistance]{.underline} (arguing that these acts [are
**not as worthy** of the label as those acts which bring about **lasting
social change**]{.underline}), Rubin appears to be taking issue with [a
**locally focused vision** of power and identity]{.underline} that
[**denies the possibility** of opposing domination at the level of
'**constructs**']{.underline} such as class.

Rubin (1996: 242) makes another argument about [celebratory accounts of
everyday resistance]{.underline} that bears consideration:

\[T\]hese authors generally [**do not differentiate** between
[practices]{.mark} that [**reproduce** power]{.mark} and those that
**alter** power. \[[The former]{.mark}\] might [involve pressing]{.mark}
that [power to]{.mark} **become more adept at domination** or to
**[dominate differ]{.mark}ently**, or it might mean **precluding
alternative acts** that would **more successfully challenge
power**]{.underline}. ... [\[[I\]t is **necessary to do
more**]{.mark} than show that such discursive acts **speak to**, or
**engage with**, power. [It **must**]{.mark} **also [be
demonstrated]{.mark}** that such acts **add up to** or **engender
broader changes**]{.underline}.

In other words, [some of the acts of [everyday resistance]{.mark}
**may** in the **real world**, through their **absorption into
mechanisms of power**, **[reinforce]{.mark} the localized
[domination]{.mark}** that [they]{.mark} **supposedly
[oppose]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The implications of this argument can be
further clarified when we study the way 'resistance' is dealt with in a
risk society.

Risk theorists already understand that every administrative system has
holes which can be exploited by those who learn about them. That is
[what **makes governmentality work**]{.underline}: the supposed governor
[is]{.underline} in turn governed -- in part through [the
**noncompliance** of subjects]{.underline} (Foucault, 1991a; Rose and
Miller, 1992). For example, where employees demonstrate unwillingness to
embrace technological changes in the workplace, management consultants
can create:

a point of entry, but also a 'problem' that their 'packages' are
designed to resolve. ... In short, consultants readily constitute
certain forms of conduct as 'resistance to technology' as this gives
them some purchase on its reform by identifying a space in which
expertise can be brought to bear in the exercise of power.
[Resistance]{.underline} consequently [plays the role of **continuously
provoking extensions**, **revisions** and **refinements** of those
**same practices** which it confronts]{.underline}. (Knights and
Vurdubakis, 1994: 80)

This appears to be a very different kind of resistance from that
contemplated by Rubin, but perhaps not so different from that of the
authors whom he and McCann and March [critique]{.underline}: those
[whose analysis **ends** at the **discursive production of
noncompliance**]{.underline}. Instead, the above account
[is]{.underline} of [a [resistance]{.mark} that **almost invariably
[helps power to work better]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A conclusion in the
present day that ominously foreshadows the futuristic, dystopic risk
assemblage described by Bogard (1996).

Another example of the 'resolution' of resistance proposed above is the
institution of a tool library described by Shearing (2001: 204--5). In
this parable, a business deals with the issue of tool theft on the part
of workers by installing a 'lending library' of tools instead of
engaging in vigorous prosecution and jeopardizing worker morale. While
the parable is meant to indicate a difference between actuarial and more
traditional (moral) forms of justice, it also demonstrates how [an act
that may be considered '**resistant**' is **incorporated without
conflict** into]{.underline} the workplace loss-prevention scheme -- [an
**eminently preferable**, '**forward-looking**' solution within the
logic of risk management]{.underline}. The same is possible in the case
of more discursive forms of resistance. If I do not see myself as a
Guinness man, for example, market researchers will do their best to
adapt Guinness to the way I do see myself (Miller and Rose, 1997). The
end result, of course, is that I purchase the beer. As manifested in a
form of justice (Shearing and Johnston, 2005), it always consolidates,
tempers emotions, cools the analysis, reconciles factions, and always
relentlessly moves forward, assimilating as it grows. In this sense,
therefore, Bogard's 'social science fiction' actually pre-supposes and
logically extends Shearing's (2001) rather cheery and benevolent
rendering of risk thinking. [In this context of]{.underline}
governmentality [theory]{.underline} -- as self-described and
[**lauded** for its **political non-prescription**]{.underline} by its
own pundits -- [the **[acts]{.mark}** or **attitudes [described as
resistant]{.mark}** are, **in the end**, **[absorbed by those who
govern]{.mark}**. Resistance as an **oppositional force** -- that
**pushes against** or has the potential to **take power** -- is
**theoretically** and **politically neutralized**. In the neutralization
process, **[power is reproduced]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

So, along with McCann and March's observations that [[everyday
resistance]{.underline}]{.mark} adds little to our understanding of
false consciousness and that it denies the role of material factors in
shaping identity, we can add Rubin's two main criticisms of everyday
resistance: it [[relies on]{.mark} an **[inaccurate
understanding]{.mark}** of power, and acts of resistance which
supposedly emancipate **actually may reinforce
domination**]{.underline}. All four of [these]{.underline} criticisms
[demand the **same thing**: to **know what is really going on**, to get
an **adequate grasp** of the social]{.underline}.

### AT: Assemblage Thinking

#### Assemblage thinking can't change the political.

**Savage, 18**---School of Social Sciences, University of Western
Australia (Glenn, "Policy assemblages and human devices: a reflection on
'Assembling Policy'," Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of
Education, 39:2, 309-321, dml)

While Ureta's [[emphasis]{.underline}]{.mark} here [[on]{.mark} the
messy, heterogeneous and emergent nature of **policy
[assemblages]{.mark}**]{.underline} fits well with his broader
conceptual framing of assemblage, these remarks [[left]{.mark} me
**[unsatisfied]{.mark}** and **unclear** as to how '**alternative
configurations**']{.underline} (p. 164) [or **more productive ways
forward** might be gained as a result of **policymakers accepting** such
a view of policy as an assemblage]{.underline}. For example, [at the end
of the day, **all policymakers must do something**, and whether this
something is **rational** or **optimal** or **not**, it is **difficult
to imagine** how a policymaker might advance a **concrete proposal for
reform** based on the]{.underline} kind of summative
[insights]{.underline} above. [I]{.underline} also
**[disagree]{.underline}** with Ureta's general statement here [that
policymakers]{.underline} typically [**fail** to be cognisant of the
deterritorialising power of new policy assemblages. Whether policymakers
see new policies as '**new** and **shiny**' or **not**]{.underline}, my
understanding from researching the motivations and modes of reasoning
employed by Australian policymakers over the past decade is that [such
individuals are often **highly aware** of the existing policy assemblage
they seek to deterritorialise through the **development of new
policies**]{.underline}. For example, central to the recent creation of
the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (a national set of
teaching standards) was an explicit desire to disrupt (deterritorialise)
old and apparently ineffective teaching practices through introducing
(territorialising) a new policy technology to measure and govern
teaching practices across the nation. The very aim of the standards,
therefore, was to 'enact a new ordering' by 'vanishing other/s' (p.
164): a process Ureta suggests 'is seldom considered' (p. 164) by
policymakers. While I agree with Ureta that those who take such matters
into consideration tend to do so through lenses of modernisation and
improvement -- which is hardly surprisingly, given a policy narrative
based on making things worse is arguably not feasible -- [the
notion]{.underline} of 'seldom' considering is surely an overstatement.
I worry here that Ureta [risks **discrediting** the work of policymakers
by making policy processes appear **overly flippant**]{.underline} --
which is, of course, out of step with his more nuanced treatment of
policymakers when discussing processes of disruption earlier in the book
(see previous section).

#### This is offense---failure to connect assemblage thinking to an [explicitly political]{.underline} agenda means they [reify]{.underline} violent power relations.

**Kinkaid, 20**---Doctoral Student in Geography at the University of
Arizona (Eden, "Can assemblage think difference? A feminist critique of
assemblage geographies," Progress in Human Geography 2020, Vol. 44(3)
457--472, dml)

As these statements might suggest, [assemblage as an ethos has placed
much emphasis on **transformation**, **flexibility**, and
**openness**]{.underline}, arguably [at the **expense** of theorizing
how socio-spatial orders **endure** and **reproduce** relations
of]{.underline} symbolic-material [inequality]{.underline}. Despite some
qualifications (Mu¨ller, 2015: 36), [themes of flux, transformation, and
possibility remain **central** to the ethos of 'thinking
assemblage']{.underline} (Wachsmuth et al., 2011; Tonkiss, 2011: 584).
As Brenner et al. observe, [this possibility is '**ontologically
presupposed** rather than being understood as **historically specific**
or **immanent** to the sociomaterial relations under
investigation']{.underline} (2011: 235), [making it **difficult** to
identify **possible constraints** or **trajectories for concrete
change**]{.underline}. Further, [this '**overgeneralized insistence** on
the openness, contingency, malleability and indeterminacy of
sociospatial forms **prior to** or **independent of concrete**,
**contextually embedded** and **informed investigation**']{.underline}
(Wachsmuth et al., 2011: 742) [can **recapitulate** the logics of
**racial thinking**]{.underline} (Schuller, 2017) [and
**neoliberalism**]{.underline} (Puar, 2017) [in **failing to account**
for which bodies are invested with fluidity and mobility, what forms of
privilege enable this 'openness to transformation', and what causes
other relations to persist and resist transformation]{.underline}.

Along similar lines, Brenner et al. worry about how [questions of
political agency are **eclipsed** by conceptions of ontological
agency]{.underline} (2011: 236), while Puar questions the value 'of
investing in notions of vibrant matter without concomitant attention to
the material conditions of the production of that matter, not to mention
deracinated and desexualized notions of vibrancy and agency' (2017: 26).
Saldanha echoes these concerns:

When Anderson et al. observe race like any assemblage is fundamentally
provisional by virtue of its heterogeneous composition, this is a first
step, but [staying with provisionality and fluidity is **politically no
different** than what **commercial multiculturalism**
promotes]{.underline}. The next step is to show how this is exactly what
makes racial differences persist. (Saldanha, 2012: 196)

[Without this kind of reflection, celebrations of ontological fluidity
can **rearticulate dominant orders**]{.underline}; as Saldanha remarks:
'ultimately cosmopolitanism without critique and intervention remains
complacent with its own comfortably mobile position' (2006: 22).

[Assemblage thinking can begin to correct this imbalance by]{.underline}
asking more questions about how social difference is (re)produced and
how relations of inequality endure and resist transformation. Accounts
of change must also consider how 'transformations' in systems often
reproduce, recode, and further entrench dominant symbolic relations. We
might then be led to a different set of questions.

There are resources within geography to pose these sorts of questions of
assemblage geographies. McGuirk et al. advocate for [an]{.underline}

[**explicitly strategic** and **politicised** assemblage thinking that
might inform strategic forms of assembling aimed to **counter attempts
to govern** for particular interests and arrangements of power that
prevent movement towards more '**emancipatory
assemblages**']{.underline}. (2016: 138)

Saldanha (2006) and Swanton (2010) provide some conceptualizations for
working against overly fluid accounts of socio-spatial orders,
describing how bodies are affected by different kinds of 'stickiness'
and 'viscosity' in racialized ways:

Neither perfectly fluid nor solid, the viscous invokes surface tension
and resistance to perturbation and mixing \... There are local and
temporary thickenings of interacting bodies, which then collectively
become sticky, capable of capturing more bodies like them. (Saldanha,
2006: 18)

Saldanha (2012) uses this concept to argue that assemblages racialize
and sort bodies, whereas Swanton (2010) describes how perceptions of
criminality 'stick to' Asian bodies in British post-industrial mill
towns. Both provide important accounts of how bodies are differentially
(de)mobilized and (in)capacitated by regimes of symbolic-material value.

[These interventions open up **larger questions** for assemblage
thinking that would be best addressed through **more substantive
engagements** with ethical and political questions: '\[r\]ather than
**ending** with questions ethical and political, perhaps we should
**start** with them']{.underline} (Saldanha, 2012: 197). [To examine the
potential for assemblages to **obscure** or otherwise **fail** to
dismantle racializing logics and projects, assemblage thinking must
**develop** its vaguely defined 'ethos']{.underline} toward a feminist
ethics. [This entails **concrete commitments** to engaging questions of
positionality, reflexivity, and other epistemological problems that
arise in assemblage thinking]{.underline}.

Positionality refers to a basic ethical requirement that we attend to
how the subject positions we inhabit inform the knowledge we produce
(England, 1994; Haraway, 1988; Nagar and Geiger, 2007; Rose, 1997).
Positionality has emerged as an ethical principle from various strands
of feminist epistemology, including standpoint theory (Collins, 1986;
Harding, 2004). These concepts describe how a subject encounters and
experiences the effects of a given set of relations depending on their
'angle of vision' (Murray Li, 2007: 265) and their position within
material, social, and representational space, necessitating various
'viewpoints' to understand a given assemblage (Haraway, 1988; Harding,
1992). Here, positionality does not refer to a view from a static or
fixed 'identity position', or one that can be known in advance. Instead,
it suggests the need for [an accounting of how different bodies inhabit
and navigate social systems, and how this informs our perceptions and
conceptions of dominant]{.underline} socio-temporal and symbolic
[orders]{.underline}. This kind of accounting [is **largely missing**
from assemblage geographies; in so far as 'assemblage analysts **deny**
that their work entails a process of **conceptual abstraction**, most
are **disinclined** to engage in a **reflexive analysis** of its
sociohistorical conditions of possibility']{.underline} (Wachsmuth et
al., 2011: 748), including questions of their own positionality and
subjectivity. To the extent that work occurring in the ontological turn
remains epistemologically locationless and unmarked (Puar, 2017: 25),
positionality presents a key feminist intervention into this work.

When put into conversation with assemblage thinking, positionality
becomes challenged and problematized in new ways that could prove
productive for this longstanding feminist ethical principle (see Puar's
\[2007: 213\] discussion). If we accept that the differential effects of
assemblages are racialized and racializing, we must consider that from
privileged subject positions, particular elements and power relations of
an assemblage are obscured from view. If we are to describe and analyze
the workings of assemblages without rearticulating privileged subject
positions, then we must account for how 'codes shift for different
bodies' (Chen, 2012: 40) and how particular material, social, and
symbolic arrangements support some bodies and obstruct others (Ahmed,
2006; Puar, 2017). An awareness of our positionality as intellectuals
and social actors is indispensable in developing such understandings.

Like positionality, reflexivity is a feminist ethical principle through
which we can more fully account for the political implications of the
knowledge we produce and the power relations within which we do so
(England, 1994; Rose, 1997). Reflexivity entails a critical accounting
of one's location and a commitment to interrogating one's
epistemological limitations and potential complicity in relations of
dominance. Drawing specifically on feminist transnational praxis, Rankin
argues that this sense of 'critical reflexivity' is crucial if
assemblage thinking is to link up to any selfconsciously political
practice (Rankin, 2011: 567). The development of such a critical
capacity need not rely on the development of more philosophical lexicons
and problematics to address it. It rather depends, as Saldanha
describes, upon the development of a sense of responsibility, a mode of
ethical relation to others (2006: 21).

Finally, these considerations of positionality and reflexivity in
assemblage geographies point to a more general oversight in assemblage
thinking: epistemology. [While one might argue that assemblage thinking
is concerned with '**ontology**' and not '**epistemology**',
epistemological problems **persist** in its formulation. While the
distinction between ontology and epistemology is useful for reminding us
that there is a **world outside** of our descriptions of it, the
distinction becomes **counterproductive** when it is taken to mean that
in 'doing ontology' we can somehow produce accounts of that world that
**do not rely** on our own limited interpretations and perspectives.
This '**naïve objectivism** entails the view that the facticity of
social life can be described "**on its own terms**", without recourse to
interpretation or theory']{.underline} (Wachsmuth et al., 2011: 744),
[**invisibilizing** epistemological locations and choices while running
the risk of rearticulating ontological premises that are **less than
emancipatory**. 'Doing ontology' without reflexive accounts of one's
epistemological position obscures the production of a powerladen reality
and, in this way, 'power dissimulates as ontology']{.underline} (Butler,
2004: 215).

Indeed, [the history of philosophy is **rife** with evidence of the
**danger** of separating ontology and epistemology]{.underline} (and
questions of power). Chen reminds us how the differential ascription of
valuation to particular bodies as an ontological principle and as the
product of a particular epistemological position has long structured
philosophical discourse:

Animate hierarchies have settled into their current life as a palimpsest
of a long journey through Aristotelian categorizations, Christian great
chains of being, Linnaean typologies, biopolitical governances,
capitalisms, and historical imperialisms; these are the traces and marks
of privileged views upon the world. (2012: 233)

We cannot, then, separate this production and maintenance of ontological
difference in philosophy from the production of social difference
through the taxonomics of race, gender, and sexuality; these
metaphysical principles infuse and motivate scientific paradigms
(Schuller, 2017), dominant political philosophies (Weheliye, 2008;
Povinelli, 2016) and everyday social practice.

In addressing these concerns of epistemology, and attendant ethical
problems, assemblage geographies have much potential for theoretical and
methodological development. However, [advocates of assemblage must
**connect** these philosophical premises to **clear normative** and
**political commitments** and **agendas** if this philosophical turn is
to live up to its oft celebrated potentials]{.underline} (Wachsmuth et
al., 2011: 743; Russell et al., 2011). In short, if we are not going to
intellectually start from 'abstractions' like race, gender, and
sexuality, [we ought to]{.underline} at least [**begin** from a
**politically engaged ethical position**]{.underline} that is
anti-racist, anti-sexist, etc. [It may take such ethical commitments to
**ensure** that assemblage thinking remains **critical** and
**sensitized** to matters of social difference]{.underline}.

### AT: Capitalism Impacts

#### There's no [feasibly solvent]{.underline} alternative to capitalism.

**Beardsworth, 10**---Head of the School of Politics and International
Studies and Professor of International Politics at the University of
Leeds (Richard, "Technology and Politics: A Response to Bernard
Stiegler," Cultural Politics (2010) 6 (2): 181--199, dml)

Now, for Stiegler, the question of technics is a Greek question because
the relation between the human and the technical is explicitly posed by
the Greeks, and any thinking on technology necessarily works within this
Greek framework.5 Whatever one makes of this thesis technologically
speaking, the question of the modern and contemporary autonomy of the
economic from the social whole is nevertheless not Greek. With the end
of the Cold War, [with increasing trans-border activity of
capital]{.underline}, [goods]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, to a much
lesser extent, [labor]{.underline}, [capital comes to **determine the
terms** in which the allocation of scarce resources is
made]{.underline}. Capital becomes, that is, general, [and [there
is]{.mark} for the foreseeable future **[no alternative]{.mark}** to
it]{.underline}.6 [**All** human beings live within the system of
capital]{.underline}, [**whatever** the particular node they live
on]{.underline}, [or conjunction they make with it]{.underline}. This
system is highly unstable and dissymmetrical with immense imbalances in
equality, natural resource distribution, financial assets, and terms of
trade. [With no alternative to capital]{.underline}, [a revolutionary
politics is **no longer tenable**]{.underline}. The ethical question
driving political innovation has, consequently, to be worked out in
terms of universally coordinated, but locally determined equilibriums
between growth, sustainability, and equity. Given economic
interdependence and the necessity of large transfers of technology and
wealth from the developed world to the developing world in the context
of climate change, **[[effective financial
regulation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[economic
coordination]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.mark} **staggered
[development]{.mark}** [present the right strategies to **tame**]{.mark}
**the [excesses]{.mark}** of neoliberal global capitalism]{.underline}.
Whether these strategies are feasible or not is at present an open
question given recent government failure to regulate risk-taking and the
evident dilemma, for developing countries, between the need for
curtailed energy use, on the one hand, and industrialization and exit
from poverty, on the other.

Now, whatever our answers to these large questions, the political
question today---'who are we?'---can only be appraised if the political
economy of a globalized world becomes the direct object of critical
attention. Only by foregrounding this object and its dilemmas will one
have any chance of critical purchase on the political challenges ahead.
In this context, Stiegler\'s [[foregrounding]{.underline}]{.mark} of
technology to promote [a **new critique**]{.underline} of political
economy [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} decisive in purpose and tone,
important in detail, but **[[misplaced]{.underline}]{.mark}** in general
intent. Stiegler is right to stress again the pertinence of the economy
for critical thought after "the supposed economism of Marxism" (2009:
29). His technologically trained focus on the alienated consumer is
important within the cognitive dimension of contemporary capitalism and
debt-led growth. But, if he is concerned to show, as a philosopher,
[the]{.underline} general lines of a re-invented critical political
economy, his [object and attention need to be **much
larger**]{.underline} than his "Greek" framework affords. Since there is
no systemic alternative to capitalism at this moment in history, [the
question]{.underline} of political economy [is]{.underline} one of
[whether **effective regulation** of capitalism is **possible** or
**not** for the world as a whole]{.underline}.

In this regard, I fear that Stiegler\'s rhetorical logic of excess
testifies to a straightforward shift of Marxist
[terminology]{.underline} (from producer to consumer) rather than a
reinvention [of]{.underline} Marxism\'s object (political economy). I
say this despite the deep interest in understanding [**cognitive
capitalism** and **consumerism**]{.underline} through Stiegler\'s
categories. To take a few examples from only the last pages of Pour une
nouvelle critique de l\'économie politique: we are witnessing the
"extreme disenchantment of the world" (2009: 88), a "generalized
proletariat \[of consumption\]" (89), the "disappearance of the middle
classes" (89), the "destruction" of social association (87), and
"lawless and faithless" elites of capitalism (88). This logic of excess
[[**ignores** the need]{.mark} today [to make **small
distinctions**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [under the canopy of **political
regulation**]{.underline}, [within the world as a whole]{.underline}.
[The art of politics today is the prudential art of **making critical
distinctions** within an economy of the same]{.underline}. "[Critical
[philosophy]{.mark}]{.underline}" [may [wish to **eschew**]{.mark} such
distinctions]{.underline}, [but [it does so at its **practical peril**
when]{.mark}]{.underline} there is no alternative to capitalism, and
when, just as importantly, [[the **mid-term horizon**
is]{.underline}]{.mark} global coordination of a world economy under
circumstances of **[[economic imbalance]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[energy-crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and
**poverty**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The **political questions**]{.mark} **today** [are]{.mark}
therefore]{.underline}: "[[**what kind of regulation** of capitalism is
**ethically** and **empirically appropriate**]{.mark}?]{.underline}";
"[[at **what level**]{.mark} is it appropriate?]{.underline}";
[and]{.underline} "[**what instance** should and can
decide?]{.underline}". These are vast and difficult questions for
philosophy, political science, and economics: they will occupy minds and
bodies for a long time to come. It is my belief that, [within these
questions and their distinctions]{.underline}, an engaged philosophy
(which Stiegler rightly advocates) has an important role to play. [A
generalized]{.underline} technological [reading]{.underline} of Marx
creates in this context important cultural work; but it **[does not
give]{.underline}** itself [the terms]{.underline} of a contemporary
critique of political economy.

I end this section with one example of what kinds of matter need to be
"adopted," and how. There has been much talk recently of the
[regulation]{.underline} of financial offshore centers. Such talk, when
coming from elite bodies in power, [**can** serve as a
smoke-screen]{.underline} to evade the major issue of imbalances within
the world economy as a whole (particularly the northwestern problem of
public and private debt). Worldwide coordinated investment in the real
economy remains in this context an outstanding question. **[That
said]{.underline}**, the [political [regulation]{.mark}]{.underline} of
these tax havens [[forms part of the **ongoing struggle**
against]{.underline}]{.mark} international and national neoliberal
practices, since it was financial offshore centers, starting with the
Eurodollar markets, which helped promote capital mobility at the end of
the 1970s.7 It is this capital mobility that ended the "social
democratic contract" between capital and labor at the level of the
nation-state and in the framework of the Bretton Woods international
system of fixed exchange rates. It consequently paved the way for
"disembedded" global **[capitalism]{.underline}**, widespread debt-led
growth, [and]{.underline}, under worldwide conditions of financial
contagion, massive **[[social disorientation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.8
The financial and economic crises of 2007--09 resulted from
"de-regulation" of domestic and global assets (from mortgages to complex
financial tools like swaps and derivatives). This de-regulation enabled
financial capital accumulation from the 1970s onwards. It is now
generally accepted that 60 percent of profits in the corporate sector
have been finance-based in the last ten years (Brenner 2006: 293). [To
regulate]{.underline} offshore accounts in this context [is therefore
**ideologically** and **structurally crucial**]{.underline} for the
political "adoption" of contemporary capitalism. For, owners of these
accounts have fed the recent spiral of risk-taking (a half of global
capital is estimated to lie in such accounts!), but they have continued
to refuse the social costs of (their) national public life. [The object
of concern for critical political economy is consequently **less**
the]{.underline} credit-card-**[consumer]{.underline}** (and profits
based on the capitalization of his or her external memory supports)
[than **effective regulation** of their economic causes]{.underline}.

That said, **[how]{.underline}**, in today\'s world economy, [can one
regulate these]{.underline} capital accounts? [This is the **urgent
political question**]{.underline}. To stop the businesses of nations
moving large amounts of their capital offshore to avoid domestic
taxation suggests either the necessity of global taxation or renewed
domestic regulation of capital outflow (as in the 1960s and 1970s in
"embedded" liberal states). The political cosmopolitan response---global
regulations of all international capital flows---is certainly the best
response theoretically since capital competition thrives on exceptions
to legal norms. It is however institutionally impractical given the weak
status of international rule. Nation-state fiscal policy is practical
since it can block capital displacement to more competitive national
markets. National monetary policy requires, however, clear leadership,
democratic example, and effective bureaucratic surveillance (and in the
case of the EU it is already not possible given the monetary sovereignty
of the European Central Bank). And so forth. My point is this.

[These kinds of [dilemmas]{.mark} immediately face any progressive
thinking]{.underline} of political economy today: [they [require]{.mark}
**careful [ethical]{.mark}** [and **empirical exposition**]{.mark}
**[before]{.mark}** one can make **[general critical
claims]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The regulation of financial offshore
centers is actually one of the more simple problems of global
cooperation to solve, although its structural effects will be deep
concerning finance-led growth. How much more [**conceptual** and
**empirical thinking** is needed [to work out]{.mark} market and
government motivation for **effective [climate]{.mark} change
[mitigation]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [[or]{.mark} to work
out]{.underline} long-term [the **global imbalance** between Chinese
savings and US [debt]{.mark}]{.underline} ... [Regarding these political
dilemmas]{.underline} concerning effective regulation of global capital
flows, [[I remain **unconvinced** that]{.underline}]{.mark} Stiegler\'s
[philosophico-technical [reading]{.mark}]{.underline} of the economy
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} (1) [**properly [delimit]{.mark}**
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} economic [[problems]{.underline}]{.mark} that
need to be adopted; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} (2) [[tease out the
**differences of approach required**]{.underline}]{.mark} to adopt
contemporary economic conditions effectively. Under the general
conditions of a capitalist world economy, however, these differences
constitute the very condition of more local social re-motivation
(Stiegler\'s very concern).

### AT: Decentralized Networks

#### Their method devolves into alt-right fetishism of anonymous networks, free speech, and intellectual property that collapses on itself and accelerates inequality.

**Baldwin, 18**---London Metropolitan University (Jon, "In digital we
trust: Bitcoin discourse, digital currencies, and decentralized network
fetishism," Palgrave Communications 4, Article number: 14 (2018), dml)

[Networks are often **fetishised**, presented and assumed to be
**decentred** and **democratic** because they **supposedly exist without
central command**. This is supposed to facilitate **non-hegemonic**,
**noncoercive**, **individualistic freedom of movement**, while
encouraging **some kind of distributed representation** and
**engagement**. To this utopian vision we have become **increasingly
suspicious**: "Don't we know now that networks **also produce
stoppages**, **closures**, **dark spots**, and their **own particular
forms of control** and **governance**?"]{.underline} (Aranda et al.,
2015, p 7) Further possible problems, and the poverty, of decentred
networks are outlined by Berry (2008). A new form of social organisation
is developing in relation to the network and networks are celebrated as
being "decentred, limitless and often, it is claimed, non-hierarchical
and structureless forms or fluid organizations" (Berry, 2008, p 365). It
follows that a distinction is made between two apparently antagonistic
economic, social and technological forms: "industrial hierarchical mass
production vs. peer-produced decentralized network production" (Berry,
2008, p 371). In this scheme [a new priority is given to "**ownership of
the immaterial**---software, algorithms, patents and copyright---that
will determine the shape of the new age"]{.underline} (Berry, 2008, p
370). It is here, however, that Berry argues that [we see the emergence
of a **problematic binary**---material/immaterial---and that even
"something as ephemeral as software has a concrete materiality which
**problematizes this distinction**"]{.underline} (Berry, 2008, p 370).
It is the case that the amount of power consumed by blockchain
operations is so large that it has been suggested that bitcoin itself is
"unsustainable" (Malmo in Golumbia, 2016, p 43). [The materiality of the
network, and the exploitative relations inherent in such materiality,
are a **blind-spot in network fetishism**.]{.underline}

[Trouble continues when we forget that the network models and diagrams
we use are **generative of a real yet to come**]{.underline},Footnote 21
when we think that the world conforms to our digital models and
algorithms Footnote 22, [or when, "we attempt to **remake the world in
terms of our network theories**"]{.underline} (Berry, 2008, p 365).
[These models are **simplifications of the world**: "The network is
**not ontological** it is **analytical**, and as such it is **restricted
in how much it can tell us** and **how useful it can be**"]{.underline}
(Berry, 2008, p 365). The problem is that "the existence of networks
invites us to think in a manner that is appropriate to networks" (Berry,
2008, p 366). [Networks **privilege the connected**, as the
unconnected---by definition---are not within the network. They **distort
a reading of reality** that highlights synchronic dispersal over
diachronic unfolding]{.underline}. In this sense, [networks "**abolish
history** and **shift our focus to the event**, the **happening** or the
**now**"]{.underline} (Berry, 2008, p 366). The idea of the decentred
network remains only "a spatial diagram which provides topological
information about the nodes that are connected with it" (Berry, 2008, p
371). Crucially, ["it **flattens reality** and **removes the
distinctions** between different nodes"]{.underline} (Berry, 2008, p
371). This means that [in a network "an **individual programmer** and a
**multinational corporation become equal** as connected nodes in the
network"]{.underline} (Berry, 2008, p 371). [What looks equal,
democratic, and decentred in the diagram of the network]{.underline},
with simple links and lines of connectivity between indistinguishable
nodes, [**conceals a massive distortion of power** and **power
relations**]{.underline}. Here we might make a distinction between the
network and the node in the way that Bruno Latour, in philosophical
discussion with Peter Sloterdijk, makes a distinction between the
network and the sphere.Footnote 23Unlike networks, "spheres are not
anemic, not just points and links, but complex ecosystems" (Latour,
2015, p 41). Likewise, nodes must be considered as complex ecosystems
behind the apparent simplicity of points, links, and lines of
diagrammatic representation. [Decentralized network fetishism **conceals
relations** and **systems of domination**, **exploitation**, and
**alienation**. This is arguably what has happened with **bitcoin**.
There is an **illusion of circumventing economic power** with
decentralised nodes but what has emerged upon **closer scrutiny** is the
**corporate occupation of cyberspace** in **powerful** and **deep
nodes**.]{.underline}

Another bitcoin obituary

In its first few years, bitcoin was a digital cottage industry run by
hobbyists and "the technology was still essentially just a volunteer
project that relied on the goodwill of users" (Popper, 2015, p 67).
Bitcoin could be mined by relatively fast home computers acting as
relatively equal nodes in a decentralised network. Today, however, most
successful mining is done by pools of dedicated high-power systems in a
sign of increasing nodal power and capital colonisation of the internet.
It is this nodal power that network fetishism is blind to. As Golumbia
suggests, this fact alone "has raised significant questions about
Bitcoins claim to 'democratise' or 'decentralise' currency operations"
(Golumbia, 2016, p 43). This also makes the Bitcoin system exposed to
the \'51 percent problem': if one node or cluster of nodes owns more
than 51 percent of the mining operations it could, at least
theoretically, "change the rules of Bitcoin at any time" (Golumbia,
2016, p 43). There are also debatesFootnote 24around bitcoin
"forks"---in open source software development terms, a possible shift to
a new version. These problems indicate that bitcoin is not as
decentralised as it imagines: "Bitcoin's own governance structures
displayed exactly the autocracy, infighting, bad faith, and
centralisation that the blockchain is often said to have magically
dissolved" (Golumbia, 2016, p 101) In essence, the promise of
decentralisation has not been kept and network fetishism has concealed
the fact that certain nodes function as centralised power bases.

Has bitcoin succeeded, or hinted at potential, in becoming digital
money? At a most basic level, moneyFootnote 25is typically held by
economists to have three prime functions: it serves as an accounting
unit, it has exchange-value (it serves as a medium of exchange), and it
has a use-value (it can store wealth). Bitcoin is arguably so well-known
because of its volatility---its price has fluctuated wildly, and it is
open to derivation and speculation.Footnote 26There is, at present, no
stability, which makes it hard to consider bitcoin a secure store of
value in the way that modulated gold might store value, or even the way
that fiat money (regulated by the state), which bitcoin was promoted to
replace, might store wealth. Bitcoin's very lack of regulation, and
openness to the whim of the market---again, something that was
championed---ensures a volatility that prevents the stability necessary
to store wealth or, indeed, act as a unit of account. The fact that
bitcoin largely "floats free of any anchor to ordinary valuing
processes" (Golumbia, 2016, p 71). means that it cannot fully function
as a stable accounting unit.Footnote 27In 2014 Goldman-Sachs announced
that "Our best definition would be that it is currently a speculative
financial asset that can be used as a medium of exchange"Footnote 28Most
accounts of Bitcoin, such as Brian Kelly's The Bitcoin Big Bang, ignore
the other functions of money and reduce money to currency only. Early
on, the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin made it the currency of choice
for illegal activity on Silk Road, a dark web vending site, using the
anonymity software Tor. This may well be its legacy: for a short time
facilitating illegal activity and the dissemination of drugs, weapons,
and dubious pornography. It is as a speculative financial asset that the
volatility of bitcoin can be understood. Like any Ponzi scheme, the
investment must be constantly talked-up, the bubble inflated, and this
allows understanding of much of the hyperbole of bitcoin discourse.

There has been hope in some quarters that bitcoin as digital money,
peer-to-peer, with encryption, would be taken up and replace, or
compete, with the likes of PayPal. However, this has not been the case.
On the horizon for bitcoin is the attempt by the likes of Apple, Google,
and Facebook to become payment platforms. They will, like bitcoin,
collect a small fee for transactions, but they will also, crucially
unlike bitcoin, obtain the data that goes along with the transaction.
Data is the new "kind of raw material" (Srnicek, 2017, p 38) of the
digital economy that is being extracted and exploited. The current
strong position these house-hold name platforms have, as well as the
business model of extracting more data, will see one or more of them
attract enough investment and venture capital to fund a "growth before
profits" model (Srnicek, 2017, p 20). This will raise use and activity,
and eventually begin to monopolise the actions and transactions of the
digital economy. In this proposed scenario, and with competition from
other digital monies such as Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Litecoin---which
purport to improve upon bitcoin's inefficiencies---bitcoin is likely to
be unable to compete. There may well be a bursting of the bitcoin
bubble, or long drawn out deflation, and all that will be remembered is
likely to be an early innovative experiment in cryptocurrency.

The bitcoin obituary is almost a genre of its own.Footnote 29In response
to the failure of bitcoin, at least in terms of its own original
ambition, new Silicon Valley advocates began arguing in 2014 that the
significant technological development was not, as Nakamoto initially
intended, a network that allowed participants to make anonymous
transactions outside the reach of the government and banking system, but
rather digital cryptology and distributed ledger technologies. It is
ironic that centralised governments and banks are now taking opportunity
of this digital technology to increase their control and power in a way
that goes against the ethos of early bitcoin ideology. In 2016, the UK
government's chief scientific adviser issued a report which said that
distributed ledger technologies "have the potential to help governments
to collect taxes, deliver benefits, issue passports, record land
registries, assure the supply chain of goods and generally ensure the
integrity of government records and services" (Lanchester, 2016, p 11).
It is thought that the blockchain can be adapted to do this with lower
friction, lower cost, and higher security than any existing system. The
use of the blockchain, albeit not in its original bitcoin form, has
naturally attracted the attention of the banks. Financial institutions,
whose centralisation bitcoin was originally intended to subvert, are
going to use this new technology to maintain their power and keep
themselves right where they are: "in the middle of every possible
transaction network, extracting all the rent they can" (Lanchester,
2016, p 12). Far from weakening government, the banks, and transforming
business, the irony and cautionary tale of bitcoin is that these
enterprises are likely to be empowered by the digital technology that
bitcoin inaugurated. In terms of wider social implications, DuPont has
argued that cryptography is a new weapon in the Deleuzian control
society: "controlling economics through the ordering application of
Bitcoin" (DuPont, 2014). The digital economy has not seen the end of
ownership and power but rather the concentration of property and power.
In the future, one might have to modify Marx and Engels' famous slogan
somewhat: "Decentred digital networkers of the world, unite! You have
nothing to lose but your blockchains!"

Conclusion, bitcoin, the commons, and collectivization

Can bitcoin and its technology have a more progressive future? One such
claim is made In The Real World of the Decentralized Autonomous Society,
where [Garrod (2016) investigates the notion]{.underline}, celebrated by
its enthusiasts, that bitcoin represents the coming [of a
**decentralized autonomous society** in which humans are **free from
centralised forms of power** and **control**]{.underline}. [Garrod
is]{.underline} rightly **[critical]{.underline}** of certain elements
of this notion [insofar as "freedom" and autonomy here is conceived of
as **only** "freedom" and autonomy from the **supposed tyranny of the
state**, not 'freedom' from]{.underline}, for instance, [the **tyranny
of the market**]{.underline}. Bitcoin discourse, "neglects the power
that capital holds over us" (Garrod, 2016, p 62) Despite this criticism
Garrod proposes that [**something can be saved** from the]{.underline}
bitcoin [experiment in digital decentralization and **utilised on the
Left** or **for the Commons**.]{.underline} Based on the model of
bitcoin technology, [it may be "possible to create distributed
collaborative organizations or 'open co-operativism' "]{.underline}
(Garrod, 2016, p 73). [This could be used to help smaller, regional
areas **protect their own commons**---whether they be in the form of
healthcare, education, water, air, Internet, knowledge, and so
on]{.underline}. In Garrod's scenario, [there is the possibility of
**harnessing reactionary technology for progressive aims**]{.underline},
that is, [taking]{.underline} bitcoin and its [technology **outside of
its neoliberal emergence** and **context** to **forward the aims of the
Left** and **serve the Commons**]{.underline}.Footnote 30With
appropriate caution, Garrod claims that bitcoin can "provide the basis
for progressive human development" (Garrod, 2016, p 74).

It is agreeable that one must challenge oppressive structures and
technological practices, but what if one is employing the technology and
tools of the oppressor, Footnote 31and that these tools transform and
distort the holder in their application?Footnote 32 [Has a technology
that was developed to serve the interests of the political right **ever
been successfully recuperated by the left**?]{.underline} Footnote 33 At
least these are concerns worth raising. The discourse around utilization
of digital cryptology appears to be dominated by issues surrounding the
protection of wealth and security of private property---is this
compatible with the aims of the Left and the Commons? Perhaps [the
**biggest obstacle**]{.underline} to the progressive possibilities of
bitcoin technology [is that]{.underline} bitcoin [digital
decentralisation is a **thoroughly ideological** and **neoliberal
notion**, both in terms of its infrastructure and as a product of
technology]{.underline}. As Golumbia has it, "political values are very
literally coded into the \[bitcoin\] software itself" (Golumbia, 2016, p
102). If there is to be a progressive employment of this digital
technology, then this code and software will need much reconsideration.

[Ultimately it may **only be the humanization**]{.underline} Footnote 34
[and **collectivization of the Internet** that sees **true progressive
values being met**]{.underline}. "Perhaps today we must collectivise the
platforms," suggests Srnicek (2017, p 127) and Golumbia argues that
[what is required to combat power "is **not more wars** between
algorithmic platforms and individuals who **see themselves as above
politics**, but a **reassertion of**]{.underline} the **[political
power]{.underline}** that the blockchain is specifically constructed to
dismantle" (Golumbia, 2016, p 102). [A **reaffirmation** and
**resurgence of organised assembly**, **public controlled** and
**collective power to govern** and **regulate certain elements** of the
digital economy could lead to the **breaking up of digital monopolies**,
**regulate business practices**]{.underline}, ban exploitative "lean
platform" employment conditions, **[impose new privacy
controls]{.underline}**, coordinate action on tax avoidance, [**liberate
us** from the tyranny of markets, and begin to **place capital** and
**power into public hands**. **Long-term egalitarian goals** and
**progressive political objectives** can come from the **collective**,
**rather than a designated centralised figurehead**. All the while
**monitoring** and **mitigating the worst excesses of State power**, and
being **independent** of the "surveillance state apparatus"]{.underline}
(Srnicek, 2017, p 127). [This is ambitious]{.underline} of course, [but
would see the **true progressive potential** of the Internet finally in
sight]{.underline}.

### AT: Liberalism Ks

#### Institutional cooperation solves violence.

**Flockhart 20** (Trine Flockhart, Professor of International Relations
at University of Southern Denmark, 'The Liberal International Order and
Peaceful Change: Spillover and the Importance of Values, Visions, and
Passions", December 23rd 2020,
<https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ethics-and-international-affairs/article/abs/liberal-international-order-and-peaceful-change-spillover-and-the-importance-of-values-visions-and-passions/8C3B9D0407E6CFEE619FB1487C31FA6B#access-block>,
WC-NAS)

[The fundamental and enduring question in the academic discipline of
international relations (IR) has always been how to change the world
into a better and more peaceful place]{.underline}---peacefully.
However, although the discipline has agreed that peaceful change is
desirable, there has been less agreement on what peaceful change is and
how to achieve it. [The debate has centered on whether peaceful change
should be understood as simply a change in the status quo without
resorting to war, or rather as a change that produces a specific
outcome, such as justice and well-being, and that it is achieved through
persuasion without the threat of violence and anchored in the rule of
law.]{.underline} During most of the history of IR, realists have
dominated the discipline and focused on the former understanding, while
[liberal theorists, and later constructivists, have emphasized the
latter. Yet, despite the disciplinary dominance of realism, in practical
governance, the idea of peaceful change has long been closely associated
with a perspective rooted in the idea of Immanuel Kant that free trade,
democracy, and cooperation through international institutions is the
best way to bring about peaceful change]{.underline}. This worldview was
later articulated by Woodrow Wilson as "[liberal internationalism" and
it has guided the gradual institutionalization of international society
culminating with the establishment of the liberal international
order]{.underline} after the Second World War. For the purposes of this
essay, I understand peaceful change to be change that is undertaken not
only without the use of violence and coercion but also with the
agreement and acceptance of those affected by it. I focus on the role of
[institutions operating as agents of peaceful change by way of making
policy decisions that aim to foster cooperative rather than conflictual
relationships. I do so from a perspective that emphasizes the importance
of a wide spectrum of human emotions to better understand the less
quantifiable but nevertheless important conditions for being able to
sustain initiatives for peaceful change]{.underline}. The essay sheds
light on the often overlooked psychological and emotional hurdles
standing in the way of agents' abilities to undertake and sustain action
designed to lead to peaceful change. To do so, I return to the
pioneering work of Ernst Haas and his important concept of "spillover,"
which suggests that once a decision has been made to pursue an
initiative designed to achieve peaceful change, unintended consequences
and unforeseen problems often compel agents to undertake further steps
within and beyond the initial policy area to achieve their set goals.
Although the influence of Haas's work faltered once it became clear that
spillover was far from a universal response to unintended consequences
and unforeseen problems, his work is a rare early example of theoretical
IR thinking that paid attention to identity, emotions, and values as
motivations for peaceful change. However, while acknowledging that
Haas's work was critically important, this essay will also argue that he
was wrong to focus on negative emotions rather than positive ones to
understand why peaceful change processes often cannot be sustained. To
both illustrate the problems with Haas's version of spillover and
highlight the potential the theory still holds, I turn to the crisis of
the liberal international order as an example of a forum where the
agency to undertake peaceful change seems to be faltering. According to
Haas, the current situation of crisis, frustration, and disappointment
is precisely what he would argue would fuel the spillover process and
therefore should enhance the process toward peaceful change. Yet, rather
than fueling the spillover process, the current crisis appears to be
having a negative impact on the motivation of those working on behalf of
the liberal order. This seems to have left the liberal international
order and its institutions unable or unwilling to start and sustain
initiatives that could contribute to peaceful change.

### AT: Nation-State Paradigm Ks

#### Nationalism [causally]{.underline} pacifies the world and [prevents]{.underline} imperial interventions.

**Metselaar, 18**---Master's candidate in International Cooperation,
Graduate School of International Studies, Seoul National University
(Sebastiaan Laurens, "A study on how modern nationalism can prevent
imperialism from re-emerging,"
<http://s-space.snu.ac.kr/bitstream/10371/141693/1/000000151525.pdf>,
dml)

The nation currently has its limitations. To break down this limitation
aspect, we can take [any nation]{.underline} for our example as all of
them, even the ones encompassing millions or even over a billion people
[has to deal with **finite** or]{.underline} to some extend [**elastic**
boundaries]{.underline}. Beyond these boundaries lie other nations.
[These boundaries represent]{.underline} the well-developed
understanding in international relations on a nation's legal property
rights. These [inviolable rights]{.underline} were [**absent** prior to
the establishment of the **nation** and]{.underline} were
**[only]{.underline}** to be [**acknowledged worldwide** by the
international community starting from the decolonization period, marking
**modern nationalism**. Now that basically all land is claimed by a
nation and that globalization has led to a world market where goods,
services, and]{.underline} (human) [resources can be exchanged with
ease, it has **drastically reduced** the attractiveness of **pull**
factors]{.underline}. Plus, [no nation imagines itself as **one**
with]{.underline} mankind, not a single nationalist dreams of a day
where [all human beings]{.underline} will join their nation as for say
Christians dream of a wholly Christian planet.

Before the French Revolution started, [both **push** and **pull**
factors were present that would attract a tribe, kingdom, or empire to
conquer territory without being held accountable for their
actions]{.underline}. The development of the nation and the
industrialization, created a larger gap between the developed areas and
undeveloped areas (i.e. Europe and basically the rest of the world).
[Imperialism was a **logical consequence** as a distinction between
nations, those who **have** nationalism, and non-nations, areas that
**do not** have nationalism]{.underline}, became clear. [No nationalism
meant that no nation had claimed **property rights** over a certain
territory]{.underline}. Thus, [prior to the decolonization period and
the development of the international system, there were **no resisting
forces** that strong ever in the history of humankind that could
**oppose imperialism**]{.underline}. Important for the understanding of
these distinctions, it has to be emphasized that the world is divided
per area and that each area was in a different stage of development.
When in Europe the nations started to form, in other parts of the world
the areas would be controlled by tribes, kingdoms, or empires. In the
past, the West became more advanced than we could have seen for example
in Asia in the 18th century. Even in present day the West takes the lead
in technological, military, and economic development, despite Asia is
catching up in some cases or even went beyond the level of certain
Western developments. Africa however is still lacking behind and there
will most probably be never a point in time where all areas in the world
reach the same level of development.

If indeed the process of nation building follows similar paths as it did
in Europe, then Africa could be in the phase of enlightenment as efforts
are being made to modernize and to search for a solid national identity.
As mentioned earlier, most developing countries are weak states. The
Hutu's and Tutsi's were enforced to live within borders they have not
chosen themselves but were enforced with by the end of the colonial
period. On a world map, the boundaries of the nations are clear, but it
does not show the nationalness of the citizens within those boundaries.
It is a painful inheritance of the colonial era. By for example
establishing a common language and modernizing education like the
Europeans did during the transition from dynasticism to nationalism and
imperialism, it will help to strengthen the imagined community that is
the nation, further decreasing the pull factors.

[Obvious **mistakes** have been made]{.underline} throughout the
decolonization period [that are still having **disastrous consequences**
today]{.underline}. Also [nations]{.underline} like Iraq, Syria, and
Lebanon [had]{.underline} their [borders drawn in the sand]{.underline}
by England and France [without]{.underline} them [taking into
account]{.underline} how **[local history]{.underline}**, religion,
geography, and economy had influenced the citizens. The people would not
identify themselves with one another, they were descendants from the
Abbasid Caliphate or the Babylonian or Ottoman Empire, all who had
different cultures. Nonetheless, these nations were (forcefully or
without much effort) created, and the problems for creating them created
the many civil wars we see in the Middle East today. [Nevertheless,
these newly established nations had claimed **full sovereignty** and
**independence** over their distinct territory, that any attempt of
conquering would be **illegal** and **costly**]{.underline} as witnessed
with IS and the Kurds, [even here a **re-emergence** of imperialism will
be **prevented**.]{.underline}

[The imagined community feature was **most important** for the
understanding of the roots of nationalism as it contains the element of
belonging to something **bigger** than the individual]{.underline}.
Explaining that it is imagined because the members of even the smallest
nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even
hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their
community (Anderson 2006). It is [the **limitation** and **sovereignty**
aspect of nationalism]{.underline} that [marked these new
nations']{.underline} their property [rights]{.underline}
([**disappearing** of pull factors]{.underline}).

[Though we do live in the **most peaceful era** of our time, we tend to
forget **how much more violent** the world has used to be]{.underline}.
These days, [more people die of **car crashes** than being killed by
**wars** or **terrorism**]{.underline}. We commemorate the wars and
celebrate our independence, to continue the realization of what happened
and to what extend we are capable of committing inhumane crimes.
[Whether internal state conflicts have been decreased]{.underline} since
the end of World War II [is **debatable**, but that clashes between
states have decreased is **undeniable**]{.underline}. The succession of
the League of Nations by [the United Nations]{.underline}, [provides one
of the **most powerful resistance** to pull factors in keeping nations
in check with regards to imperial ambitions. Obviously there were
**tensions**]{.underline} during for example the Cold War [and conflicts
**did break out** between states, but in light of the **historic time
frame**, it has **never been this peaceful** as it is today. No Roman or
Ottoman empire can start a **conquest**]{.underline}, in fact, ever
[since the end of the last great war no country recognized by the United
Nations has been **conquered** or **wiped off the map**]{.underline}.
[Even the superpowers today who have all the means for starting their
imperial conquest have to take into account that such conquest are **too
costly to undertake**]{.underline} (e.g. Russia and Crimea, China and
Tibet). [And despite that conflicts are still present; the United
Nations does not only have the tools to **interfere** military
wise]{.underline} (i.e. peacekeeping operations), [but also the
capabilities to **sanction** perpetrators. The United Nations might be
**far from perfect**]{.underline} as power struggles within the system
exist, causing nations among each other to differentiate in meaning and
action. [However, as long as it is in place, nations will **rethink**
once more their behavior]{.underline}.

Thus, [no country has attempted to **conquer another nation** ever since
the end of the decolonization period. The rise of the nation has a
**causal relationship** to the **decline in interstate
violence**]{.underline}. Moreover, the [nationalists]{.underline} in a
country [**do not want** to start an imperial conquest and make
colonies]{.underline}, instead, [they want the colonials **out** of
their country. The nationstate as we know it today is **deeper rooted**
in the emotions of the masses than any other previous political
organization has achieved before]{.underline}. In order for nationalism
to develop and for sovereignty to be claimed by the populace, a complete
revision of the status quo was required.

As for Korea, the foundation of nationalism developed during the
annexation by Japan and it was not strong enough to prevent the
separation between the North and South. These days, South-Korea has
probably one of the strongest forms of nationalism. The love for the
flag and the (popular) culture, the remembrance of its past, all
contribute to strong sense of horizontal connection. The best and most
recent display of Korea's nationalism were the regular massive protests,
by the millions, opposed to the Korean president. The fear of the Korean
people in the survey stated in the introduction are therefore overrated.

the economic hunger for growth]{.underline}. Thus, [most conquests were

### AT: Nation-States=Obsolete

#### Nation-states are [not]{.underline} obsolete.

**Sneltvedt, 20**---doctoral research fellow in the literature, area
studies, and European languages department at the University of Oslo
(Ole, "The Political Landscape and the Nation-State: Arendtian Commons
and the American Revolution," *Bringing the Nation Back In:
Cosmopolitanism, Nationalism, and the Struggle to Define a New
Politics*, Chapter 3, pg 48-50, dml)

Now, a decade later, there seem to be several ways of critiquing Beck's
argument for methodological cosmopolitanism. [[Globalization has **not**
led to a cosmopolitan condition, but]{.mark} rather [renewed]{.mark}
discourses of **[national identity]{.mark}**, as well as
[attempts]{.mark}---as in]{.underline} the case of [**Brexit**---[to
**regain**]{.mark} the territorial and economic sovereignty of [the
state]{.mark}]{.underline}. The failure to predict and come to terms
with such phenomena might indicate that [we are **still being held
prisoners**]{.underline}, only [this time by **methodological
cosmopolitanism**]{.underline}.

[A similar critique can be directed toward]{.underline} Fraser's
argument for **[transnationalizing the public sphere]{.underline}**.
Today, it is not only the case that [transnational public opinion **does
not have an addressee** in the form of "**transnational public
powers**"]{.underline} (Fraser 23). Rather, it seems that
[**[despite]{.mark}** the rapid increase in both quantity and speed of
[**global communication**, there is **no**]{.mark} **formation** of a
[global public opinion but a]{.mark} relatively stable [**plurality**
of]{.mark} not only **[conflicting]{.mark}** but also **mutually
[exclusive]{.mark}** [arguments]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The purpose of this paper is not to pursue further a critique of
methodological cosmopolitanism or the notion of transnational public
spheres. Rather, I direct my attention toward the notion that [seeing
nations, states, and territories as socially constructed and sustained
through discourse involves [the]{.mark} **implicit [assumption]{.mark}**
[that]{.mark} political communities contain **only**]{.underline} two
elements: [people and communication. This enables the argument
that]{.underline}, together with capital and commodities, members of the
discursive community of [[the nation-state are **swept away**]{.mark}
from their national islands [into]{.mark} the streams of [the **global
network**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cosmopolitan Vision 80). [This view, by
favoring movement over stability, discourse over action, and people over
things, **[eclipses]{.mark}** the fact [that]{.mark} political
communities contain **more** than the two elements above.
[Nation-states]{.mark}]{.underline}, as one type of political community,
also involve two additional elements, action and things, which are
related to situatedness and stability.

This primacy of communication appears not only in political theory, but
also in its underlying metaphors. In considering a transition From
Realpolitik to Dingpolitik or How to Make Things Public, Bruno Latour
argued that "political philosophy has often been the victim of a strong
object-avoidance tendency" (15). Discussing the much-addressed
frontispiece of Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan and Ambrogio Lorenzetti's
famous Allegory of Good and Bad Government, he makes the observation
that they [[contain **not merely people** and]{.mark} their
[**communication**, but "]{.mark}**clothes**, [a]{.mark} **huge
[sword]{.mark}**, **immense [castles]{.mark}**, **large cultivated
[fields]{.mark}**, **crowns**, **ships**" and an array of
**[buildings]{.mark}**, **walls**, and **cultivated
landscapes**]{.underline} (16--17). Arguably, [the same applies to other
metaphors of political communities]{.underline}. In Plato's famous
example of the Ship of State, which illustrates the troubled
relationship between the people and the philosopher, the senate and the
plebs, the ship, the sea and the wind serves as a mere stage for the
unfolding action (Plato Book VI).

In these metaphors [the social relationships and struggles for power are
made intelligible against a **particular context**, which is **taken for
granted**. The same]{.underline} arguably [applies to theories of nation
and state]{.underline}, as well as territory. [The discourse of imagined
communities, the [governance]{.mark} by states or non-state actors, and
the constant upkeep of territory [**take place somewhere** and **against
something**. Political communities]{.mark}, of which the nation-state is
one type]{.underline}, thus [[involve **more than imagined
communities**]{.mark}, **more than [state institutions]{.mark}**; they
[also]{.mark} involve a **third layer**, [a **political landscape** in
which action **literally takes place**]{.mark}. Places **do not easily
liquidize** and **enter global flows**]{.underline}. Rather, as Agnew
noted, they "form nodes around which human activities circulate" (Place
and Politics 28). In the following section I will argue that [[the
cosmopolitan condition **does not transcend**]{.underline}]{.mark}
Arendt's human condition: [[our]{.underline}]{.mark} "web of human
relationships" still relies on a "**[[world of
things]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (The Human Condition 183, 52).

### AT: Xenofeminism

#### Xenofeminism undermines intersectionality, fails to address technological exclusion, and ignores the war economy

**Jones 19** -- *PhD from SOAS University of London, MA from University
College London (UCL), LLB Law degree from the London School of Economics
and Political Science (LSE)* (Emily, 12-10-2019, \"Feminist Technologies
and Post-Capitalism: Defining and Reflecting Upon Xenofeminism,\" SAGE
Journals,
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0141778919878925?journalCode=fera)//KH

[Xenofeminism does, however, have its potential
limitations]{.underline}. Hester (2018a, p. 460) notes [one possible
limitation]{.underline} herself, highlighting the fact that [the
Xenofeminist Manifesto seeks to create a 'universal', something which
could be seen as sitting **against the grain of intersectional**
feminism.]{.underline} However, Hester states that the problem with the
universal is not the universal itself, but rather what it has been
filled up with. While the universal has, until now, been used to claim
neutrality while imposing a white, masculinist worldview, it can also
reflect difference. Hester (ibid.) thus defines xenofeminism's universal
as an intersectional universal, 'cutting across race, ability, economic
standing and geographical position' (Laboria Cuboniks, 2015, Zero 0×00).

[Despite xenofeminism's attention to intersectionality and Hester's
clarification of the universal, xenofeminism remains open to critiques
of Eurocentrism]{.underline}. The techno-[utopian arguments]{.underline}
put forward by xenofeminism clearly [come from the standpoint of the
highly technologically mediated **Global North**]{.underline}. [While
the manifesto notes inequalities in access to technological benefits to
some extent,]{.underline} noting, for example, how 'the world's poor is
adversely affected by the expanding technological industry', explicitly
noting the toxic conditions, for example, of those working in e-waste
sites (ibid., Interrupt 0×08), [the manifesto merely notes the need to
acknowledge 'these conditions as a target for elimination' as part of
the greater problem of late capitalism]{.underline} (ibid.). [The impact
of these inequalities in access and the subsequent impact on **who can
be part of the xenofeminist techno-utopian future** are not, however,
explicitly discussed]{.underline}. While capitalism is noted as a root
cause of inequalities, [colonialism is not highlighted despite the clear
nexus between capitalism and colonialism in shaping global tech
inequalities]{.underline}. Much would be gained from the application of
transnational, postcolonial and decolonial feminist thought to
xenofeminism, as Annie Goh (2019) has recently shown in great detail.

Another concern with xenofeminism is [its lack of consideration for
militarism and the ways in which capitalism and militarism are
linked.]{.underline} While xenofeminism [does note some of the dark
sides to technology posed by capitalism, discrimination and oppression,
the manifesto and the work published by Hester since do not address the
links between militarism and technology.]{.underline} In the meantime,
[the war economy is vast]{.underline}. Global military spending has been
estimated by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
(SIPRI) to have been around US\$1.6 trillion in 2016.8 [Much of this war
economy is driven by the development and deployment of
technology,]{.underline} with many now civil-use technologies having
originally been created by the military, such as Satellite Navigation.
Given the vast amount of funding going into the research and development
of machine intelligence in military settings, as exemplified by the US
Department of Defense's Project Maven,9 and the multiple calls for
autonomous weapons systems (see, for example, Arkin, 2013; Jeangène
Vilmer, 2015), the [potentials for feminists in accelerating
technological advancement seem somewhat less appealing when one thinks
of **machines also doing the labour of killing
(**]{.underline}**J**ones, 2018).

## Afropessimism

### Ontology---Gordon

#### The critique is wrong---anti-blackness is contingent upon functions of institutionalized social power, which requires institutional, not ontological transformations. Even if they win that antiblackness is ontological, it can only be resolved politically. 

**Gordon 17** \[Lewis Gordon (A professor of philosophy with
affiliations in Judaic studies, Caribbean and Latina/o studies, and
Asian and Asian American studies at UCONN-Storrs), 2017, The Oxford
Handbook of Philosophy and Race, pp. 296-298\] // st

[[Should]{.mark} the [analysis remain]{.mark} at [white and black, the
world would appear]{.mark} **more [closed]{.mark} than it in fact
is**.]{.underline} For one, simply being born black would bar the
possibility of any legitimate appearance. [This is a
position]{.underline} that has been [taken by a growing group of
theorists known as "Afro-pessimists"]{.underline} (Wilderson 2010;
Sexton 2011). [Black for them is absolute "social death:' it is outside
of relations.]{.underline} [[Missing from this view is]{.mark};
however]{.underline}, is at least what I argued in Bad Faith and
Antiblack Racism, which [is [that no]{.mark} human [being is]{.mark}
"really" [any of these things]{.mark}; the claim itself is a
manifestation of mauvaise foi.]{.underline} [The project of making
people into such is one thing.]{.underline} [People actually becoming
such is another.]{.underline} This is an observation Fanon also makes in
his formulation of the tone of nonbeing and his critique of Self---Other
discourses in Peau noir, masques blancs (Black Skin, White Masks). Fanon
distinguishes between the zone of nonbeing (nonappearance as human
beings) and those of being. 'The latter presumes a self-justified
reality, which means it does not call itself into question. The former
faces the problem of illegitimate appearance (Fanon 1952, chapters;
Gordon 1999; AIcoir 2006; Yancy 2008). Thus, even the effort "to be" is
in conflict as the system in question presumes legitimate absence of
certain groups. Yet, paradoxically, the human being comes to the fore
through emerging from being in the first place. Thus, the assertion of
being is also an effort to push the human being out of existence, so to
speak. The racial conflict is thus changed to an existential one in
which an existential ontology is posed against an ontology of being.
Existential ontology pertains to human being, whereas ontological being
pertains to gods. This is why Fanon concludes that racism is also an
attack against human being, as it creates a world in which one set
stands above others as gods and the rest as below human. Where, in this
formulation, stand human beings? The argument itself gains some clarity
with the etymology of "existence" which is from the Latin expression
exsístere (to stand out, to emerge -that is, to appear). Blacks thus
face the paradox of existing (standing out) as nonexistence (not
standing out). The system of racism renders black appearance illicit.
This conundrum of racialized existence affects ethics and morals.
Ethical relations are premised on selves relating to another or others.
The others must, however, appear as such, and they too, manifest
themselves as selves. Implicit in such others as other selves is the
formalization of ethical relations as equal. as found in the thought of
Immanuel Kant and shifted in deference to the other in that of Emmanuel
Levinas, Racism, however, excludes certain groups from being others and
selves (if interpreted as being of a kind similar to the presumed
legitimate selves). Thus, [the schema of racism is one in which the
hegemonic group relates to its members as selves and others, whereas the
nonhegemonic groups are neither selves nor others.]{.underline} They, in
effect, could only be such in relation to each other. It is, in other
words, a form of ontological segregation as a condition of ethics and
morals. [The fight against racism, then, does not work as a fight
against being others or The Other.]{.underline} [It is a fight against
being nonothers.]{.underline} Fanon's insight demands an additional
clarification. [Racists should be distinguished from
racism.]{.underline} Racists are people who hold beliefs about the
superiority and inferiority of certain groups of racially designated
people. [[Racism is the system of institutions and]{.mark} social [norms
that empower individuals with]{.mark} such
[beliefs]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Without that system, a racist
would]{.mark} simply be an obnoxious]{.underline}, whether overtly
deprecating or patronizing, [individual.]{.underline} [With that system,
racist points of view affect the social world as reality.]{.underline}
[Without that system, racists ultimately [become]{.mark} inconsequential
and]{.underline}, in a word, [[irrelevant]{.underline}]{.mark} beyond
personal concerns of saving their souls from unethical and immoral
beliefs and choices. Fanon was concerned with racists in his capacity as
a psychiatrist (therapy, if necessary). but he was also concerned with
racism as a philosopher, social thinker, and revolutionary (Fanon
1959/1975). The latter, in other words, is a system, from an antiracism
perspective, in need of eradication. [An objection to the
Afro-pessimistic assertion of blackness as social death could thus
be]{.underline} raised from a Fanonian phenomenological perspective:
[Why must the social world be premised on the attitudes and perspectives
of antiblack racists?]{.underline} [Why don't blacks among each other
and other communities of color count as a social
perspective?]{.underline} And [[if]{.mark} the question of [**racism is
a function of power**, why not]{.mark} offer **a [study of
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}, how it is gained and lost, [[instead of an
assertion]{.mark} of [its]{.mark} manifestations as
[ontological]{.mark}?]{.underline} An additional problem with the
Afro-pessimistic model is that its proponents treat "blackness" as
though it could exist independent of other categories. A quick
examination of double consciousness (Du Bois 1903)---a phenomenological
concept if there ever were one by virtue of the focus on forms of
consciousness and, better, that of which one is conscious, that is,
intentionality would reveal why this would not work. Double conscious
ness involves seeing oneself from the perspective of another that deems
one as negative (for example, the Afro-pessimistic conception of
blackness). That there is already another perspective makes the subject
who lives through double consciousness relational. Added is what Paget
Henry (2005) calls polemic, ted double consciousness and Nahum Chandler
(2014, 6o---6i) calls the redoubled gesture, which is the realization
that the condemnation of negative meaning means that one must not do
what the Afro pessimist does. Seeing that that position is false moves
one dialectically forward into asking about the system that attempts to
force one into such an identity: [This relational matter requires
[looking beyond blackness]{.mark} ironically in order to understand
blackness.]{.underline} [This [means moving from]{.mark} the conception
of [meaning as singular]{.mark}, substance-based, fixed, and semantical
[into the grammar of how meaning is produced]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such
grammars, such as that of gender, emerge in interesting ways (Gordon
1999, 124---129; 1997,73---74). However, as all human beings are
manifestations of different dimensions of meaning, the question of
[identity requires more than an intersecting model; otherwise there
will]{.underline} simply be [one (a priori) normative outcome in every
moment of inquiry: whoever manifests the maximum manifestation of
predetermined negative intersecting terms.]{.underline} That would in
effect be an essence before an existence indeed, before an actual event
of harm. This observation emerges as well with the Afro-pessimist model
when one thinks of pessimism as the guiding attitude. The existential
phenomenological critique would be that optimism and pessimism are
symptomatic of the same attitude: a priori assertions on reality.
[[Human existence is contingent]{.mark} but not accidental, which means
that [the social world]{.mark} at hand [is a manifestation of]{.mark}
choices and relationships in other words, [human
actions]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Because human [beings can only build the
future]{.mark} instead of it determining us, [the task]{.mark} at
hand]{.underline}, as phenomenology-oriented existentialists from
Beauvoir and Sartre to Fanon, William R. Jones, and this author have
argued, [**[depends on commitment]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This concern
also pertains to the initial concerns about authenticity discourses with
which I began. One could only be pessimistic about an outcome, an
activity. It is an act of forecasting what could only be meaningful once
actually performed. Similarly, one could only be optimistic about the
same. [What however, if there were no way to know either?]{.underline}
Here we come to the foi element in mauvaise foi. [Some actions are
deontological, and if not]{.underline} that, [they are at least
reflections of our commitments, our projects.]{.underline} [Thus, the
point of some actions is not about their success or failure but whether
we deem them worth doing.]{.underline} Taking responsibility for such
actions---bringing value to them--- is opposed to another manifestation
of mauvaise foi: the spirit of seriousness.

### Ontology---Mitchell

#### Shirking nuanced engagement for the sake of "abstraction" [doesn't]{.underline} make them radical, it [obscures]{.underline} their own investment in [every structure they critique]{.underline}.

**Mitchell, 20**---Associate Professor and Feminist Studies Graduate
Director, Critical Race and Ethnic Studies Department, UC Santa Cruz
(Nick, "The View from Nowhere: On Frank Wilderson's Afropessimism,"
<https://spectrejournal.com/the-view-from-nowhere/>, dml) \[language
modifications denoted by brackets\]

[Afropessimism trains its reader in the **leaps** and **bounds** of
faith necessary]{.underline} for this notion [to be
entertained]{.underline}. [Though [Wilderson]{.mark} sheds
**considerable ink** critiquing nonBlacks for **analogizing** their
condition to Black folks, his [**own** understanding of]{.mark} his
[Blackness gets established through **analogy**]{.mark}]{.underline},
too. Early on in the book, a young Frank is with his grandmother. They
are watching the rebellions in the wake of the assassination of Martin
Luther King, Jr. Their conversation reads as if a dress rehearsal for
Afropessimist philosophy.

When, prompted by the billowing smoke and the scenes of looting, [young
Frank asks]{.underline} Grandmother Jules, "[Why are we
mad?]{.underline}" [The reader is **not prompted** to question the
integrity of the "**we**" that extends from the **mansion**
in]{.underline} Kenwood---[the **well-heeled Minneapolis
neighborhood**]{.underline} that the Wildersons are integrating---[to
the **unspecified** Black postindustrial]{.underline} ghetto [\[zone\]
that "could have been **anywhere** and **everywhere**."]{.underline}7
Kenwood is nowhere on that map, but it's a nowhere that extends, by way
of a gaze accompanying the presumption of shared affect, to a Black
anywhere and everywhere.

[The presumption of shared feeling **does the work of analogy** without
calling attention to it]{.underline}. When young Frank's grandmother
shouts "Go ahead, son!" at a man depicted on television as a looter, it
doesn't strike the budding Afropessimist as theoretically significant
that the looter can neither hear nor speak back. [The gap]{.underline}
between Frank and Grandmother Jules on one side, and the looter on the
other, [gets bridged through **affective projection**, not a
**solidaristic expression** among equals]{.underline}.

For Wilderson, the [defining features of the violence foundational
to]{.underline} modern slavery (and therefore
[antiBlackness]{.underline}) [are its **gratuitousness**, its freedom
from]{.underline} having to serve any [**rational purpose**,
and]{.underline}, above all, [its **personal nature**]{.underline}.
(I'll elaborate on this final point below.) [Such a theory]{.underline}
of violence [makes for a situation where [a reader]{.mark} who is [left
**skeptical**]{.mark} about the conclusions Wilderson draws]{.underline}
as a narrator or theorist [[is encouraged to see]{.underline}]{.mark}
herself \[[[themselves]{.underline}]{.mark}\] as sort of like Dr.
Zhou---[[as]{.mark} someone [**unwilling** or **unable** to face]{.mark}
that [nonsensical violence]{.mark} is precisely what makes
Blackness]{.underline}.

[To insist that antiBlack violence make sense would be to impose onto it
an **ahistorical rationality**. It would force antiBlack violence to be
**recognizable** within the norms of violence that nonBlacks
face]{.underline}. So, while there are moments when I questioned whether
there might have been other plausible interpretations of many of the
book's pivotal scenes, part of the thrust, it would seem, is to
challenge its reader to suspend disbelief. [[Gratuitous violence
**doesn't make sense**. **That's the point**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

**[[It's a hell of a rhetorical mechanism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and
one of the reasons why I advocate for reading Afropessimism with a
certain degree of care. [[Any]{.mark} [theoretical formation]{.mark}
with a self-defense mechanism [that **refashions** those that
disagree]{.mark} with it [into a **symptom**]{.mark} of the problem it
is diagnosing [has]{.mark}]{.underline} most likely [**[crossed]{.mark}
the line [from theory into theology]{.mark}**. Like **Marxists** who
reflexively label any criticism as **petty bourgeois**, or **Lacanians**
anxious to read any pushback as]{.underline} the outcome of
[**unconscious repression**, [there is **no way to test it**
except]{.mark} on [the terms]{.mark} that [it has **itself
provided**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

At times it seems like Wilderson's reading of the slave relation as a
personal one turns the self into an upscaling mechanism. If second wave
feminists insisted that the personal was political, [Wilderson's
interpretive practice]{.underline} suggests that the personal is always
already peculiar-institutional. It [provides a means of **refashioning**
one-on-one dynamics and interactions such that they become **immediately
available** for generalization]{.underline}.

Wilderson's descriptions of the concrete seem overwhelmed by an apparent
demand to represent people, in the first instance, on the model of
archetypes. [It is not simply that nonBlack people are always invested
in the position of the master in some **hazy** or **general** way.
Wilderson's narrations indicate that nonBlack people are invested in the
**personal** character of that relationship in such a way that makes
**him** their slave, in **particular**]{.underline}.

THE DISAPPEARING STATE

[[This analytic practice]{.mark} of turning social relations between
Black and nonBlack persons]{.underline}, formal and informal, [into one
organized in the **first instance** by the slave-master dualism has
**serious implications** for]{.underline} Wilderson's [ability to assess
**complex relationships**]{.underline}. In the art center, his co-worker
Sameer, an immigrant from Palestine who seems to share with Frank an
interest in revolutionary internationalist politics, is grieving. Sameer
has just received news of the death of his cousin who, in a tragic
accident, was trying to craft a bomb in Ramallah. As Sameer is relating
his grief, he shares stories with Frank about life under settler
occupation. Yet the account hinges on Sameer's comment that, for the
Palestinian under occupation confronted with Israeli troops, "shame and
humiliation runs even deeper if the Israeli soldier is an Ethiopian
Jew."

Wilderson is quick to dispense those questions of the complex and
contradictory imbrications of racialization, religion, and nation. He
instead makes Sameer's expression of grief into one not only about
Blackness, but about a Blackness that Wilderson, in spite of his
geopolitical location, has an obvious and transparent claim to immediate
understanding. That Sameer and Frank stand in for the possibility---now,
more specifically, the impossibility---of Palestinian-Black solidarity
simply goes without saying.

[**Details of actual coalition building needn't be fussed with**. These
**proportions**, and the idea that they can be **generalized**, must be
treated as **obvious** or **unspoken**]{.underline} in order to offer
the encounter its dramatic framing. With Sameer's words, Wilderson
explains, "The earth gave way. The thought that my place in the
unconscious of Palestinians fighting for their freedom was the same
dishonorable place I occupied in the minds of Whites in America and
Israel chilled me."8

[The assumed personality of the slave relation [offers a **hair-trigger
impulse** to abstraction]{.mark} and analogy]{.underline}. With stunning
quickness, [[it turns a **state soldier** into a **slave** and a
**suffering comrade** into a **theoretical occasion**]{.mark}. As selves
scale across space and time, they scale up in proportion]{.underline}:
Sameer, in his grief, appears to offer unyielding access to a
Palestinian collective unconscious that is already fixated on putting
the slave in his place.

[As it scales, the Afropessimist practice of [abstraction has to]{.mark}
**erase**, or **[ignore]{.mark}**, a lot of **[complicating
details]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The reader is **not invited** to
consider]{.underline} the possibility that Sameer might have meant
something quite different, [that [it **might not make sense** to
analogize the racial organization in a **different geopolitical
context**]{.mark}, or the significance of the fact that [a Black person
might **participate** in]{.mark} the consolidation of [state power as
**anything other** than its **unwilling
instrument**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Ethiopian soldier's gun, for
instance, is explained away in a dependent clause.

But [those who have embraced Afro-pessimism will **likely not be
swayed**]{.underline} by anything I have said above. In the final
instance, the Afropessimist imaginary is fueled by a confidence toward
which it gestures but rarely states explicitly. [[The idea is]{.mark}
that the virtue of Afropessimism consists in the fact that it does
something **important** for Black people, that [it allows Black people
to **speak**]{.mark} **deeply repressed [truths]{.mark}** about the
social world, truths that make their nonBlack enemies and allies feel
**profoundly unsafe**]{.underline}.

[[My first response]{.underline}]{.mark} to this repressive hypo- thesis
[would of course be, "**[which Black people?]{.mark}**" The second would
be about the nature of the relationship between **speech** and
**action** envisioned here. [While many who embrace Afropessimist ideas
imagine]{.mark} that [doing so will animate a **radical
politics**]{.mark} that can live beyond a kind of collective
world-historical recognition of antiBlackness, [that is **not**]{.mark}
a confidence [shared by its]{.mark} principal [theorist]{.mark}. He is
**consistently vague**]{.underline}: "\[Afropessimism\] makes us worthy
of our suffering." Or "Afropessimism is Black people at their best. . .
\[It\] gives us the freedom to say out loud what we would other- wise
whisper or deny: that no Blacks are in the world, but, by the same
token, there is no world without Blacks."9

Or, [[the virtue]{.mark} of the theory [exists in the **pleasure of
scaling itself**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Speaking of the relief of being
in an all-Black group at a multiracial conference, Wilderson writes,

I was able to see and feel how comforting it was for a room full of
Black people to move between the spectacle of police violence, to the
banality of microaggressions at work and in the classroom, to the
experiences of chattel slavery as if the time and intensity of all three
were the same.10

Extending the feel-good experience of this proto-Afropessimist scene of
affirmation, for Wilderson, is the fact that [**[no one asks]{.mark} any
[questions]{.mark}**[, **inserts**]{.mark} **any
[uncertainty]{.mark}**[, or **demands**]{.mark} **any
[specificity]{.mark}** when group members talk about the
contemporariness of chattel slavery]{.underline}. "Folks cried and
laughed and hugged each other and called out loud for the end of the
world. No one poured cold water on this by asking, What does that
mean---the end of the world?"11

But [when the]{.underline} all-Black group's breakout [session ends,
they are at an **impasse**, because they are supposed to talk with their
nonBlack "allies" about what happened]{.underline}. Eventually
[one]{.underline} member of the group [suggests]{.underline} what will
become their ultimate course of action: "We would go back in and
[**refuse to speak** with them]{.underline}. Not a protest, just [a
silent acknowledgement]{.underline} of the fact [that]{.underline} we
**[would not corrupt]{.underline}** what we experienced [with their
**demand for articulation** between their grammar of suffering and
ours]{.underline}."12

Wilderson offers little insight into the process that led to this
decision, partly because the point of the scene is to teach us to read
silence in the Afropessimist register. Just as young Frank viewed
Grandmother Jules laughing and yelling at the television, [[the reader
is led]{.underline}]{.mark}, by the overwhelming sense of joy and relief
in the scene, [[to read the **absence of disagreement** as the
**presence of assent**.]{.mark} Silence]{.underline}, here, [appears to
affirm the criticality of Afropessimism]{.underline}.

THEORY---CRITIQUE---THEORY

In the book's final pages, Frank tells a student who is visiting his
office that "the thing that prevented most students from getting their
heads around Afropessimism was the fact that it described a structural
problem but offered no structural solution to that problem."13 My read
is different. [[It is not that Afropessimism offers **no solution** so
much as it **substitutes**]{.mark} **itself** for one. It offers
**knowledge itself** as the end, as a good that resides in the place
that other theories would put the exhortation to **practice**---and in
practice, to **test** the theory]{.underline}.

This is something different than saying that, when it comes to
Afropessimism's political imaginary, there's no there there. My point is
that [in the end, [Afropessimism is a **view from somewhere**]{.mark},
and [that somewhere is]{.mark}]{.underline}, perhaps all too obviously,
[[the **university**]{.mark}. The place where all roads in Afropessimism
ultimately lead, that place [where theorizing is a **valued
mode**]{.mark} **of practice** [in]{.mark} and of [itself]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} where it **[does not need to be justified]{.mark}** on any
other terms. [The]{.mark} modern [university does not only
**enable**]{.mark} the practice of **[diagnosing problems with no
solutions]{.mark}** to hand, [and]{.mark} to develop [critiques that
**do not open**]{.mark} immediately [onto]{.mark} strategies of
**[redress]{.mark}**; [it **enshrines** the right to do so and
**valorizes** the subject that does]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Afropessimism claims to offer **no sanctuary** while its practitioner
is]{.mark} in fact [modeled on the **privileged subject of Enlightenment
humanism**, which sought to **liberate** knowing from being **judged**
by the actions it **did** or **did not enable**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Ontology---More

#### Err aff---ontology is [descriptive]{.underline}, not [prescriptive]{.underline}. Presuming anti-Blackness is ontological [prevents]{.underline} change, but assuming it [isn't]{.underline} has [liberatory force]{.underline}.

**More, 19**---former professor of philosophy at the University of the
North, University of Durban-Westville, and University of KwaZulu-Natal
(Mabogo, "The Transformative Power of Lewis R. Gordon's Africana
Philosophy in Mandela's House," *Black Existentialism: Essays on the
Transformative Thought of Lewis R. Gordon*, Chapter 6, pg 75-76, Kindle,
dml)

What these [critics **ignore**]{.underline} in Gordon's work is, first,
the role "liberation" plays in the tripartite constitution of his
Africana philosophy. This is of course a basic failure to grasp a
philosophy that is based upon [an approach to struggle]{.underline}, an
approach [that is **fundamentally** about]{.underline} consciousness
raising and, I may add, the massification of the philosophy of
resistance so that those who are in the struggle can provide rational
answers for themselves. This kind of philosophizing is precisely what
Biko and those in the Black Consciousness movement referred to as
"**[[conscientization]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [In all the
articulations]{.underline} of conscientization, ["**action**" or
"**praxis**" is the **key**. This]{.underline} kind of philosophical
tradition, from Sartre to Fanon to Gordon, [[is **not simply**]{.mark}
**a meditative** or **[abstract self-reflective]{.mark}** and **aloof
[contemplation]{.mark} process [outside real existence]{.mark}**,
[but]{.mark} a [**complete involvement** in]{.mark} the **drama of
[that]{.mark} very [existence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As a philosopher
of existence, Gordon subscribes to Sartre's description of philosophy as
"concerned with man---who is at once an agent and an actor, who . . .
lives the contradictions of his situation, until either his
individuality is shattered or his conflicts are resolved" (1975,
11--12).

Second, Headley and Curry seem to ignore the existentialist concept of
"radical conversion" or what Simone de Beauvoir calls "existential
conversion." [[Salvation from]{.underline}]{.mark} the terror of
[[racism]{.underline}]{.mark}, Gordon argues, [[requires]{.mark} a
radical conversion]{.underline}; that is, [the [**acceptance** of our
**contingent**]{.mark} **unjustifiable [existence]{.mark}**.
This]{.underline} conversion [means]{.underline} a move through a
process of self-recovery from a consciousness that was previously
corrupted to one in which freedom is the absolute value, one in which
[we recognize [that]{.mark} our situation **[does not have to be as it
is]{.mark}**, that [this racist situation **can** and **ought to be
changed**]{.mark}. For liberation to occur]{.underline}, Gordon
explains: "[We **need to admit**, at bottom, that our situation
**doesn't have to be as it is**]{.underline}. We need to embrace the
negative aspect of existence in the form of existential or radical
conversion" (1995a, 134).

Clevis Headley, for example, faults Gordon for not paying attention to
the question of agency in an antiblack world. Flowing from this charge,
Headley, as mentioned above, asks: "[How can a black person living in an
antiblack world **express human agency**? [Should blacks **simply resign
themselves** to the fact the **world is
antiblack**]{.mark}?]{.underline}" (1997, 341). The latter question is
reminiscent of the charge of "quietism" leveled against existentialism.
The problem with this [critique]{.underline} is that it **[does
not]{.underline}**, in the first place, [**take into account the
[methodological constraints]{.mark}** [imposed]{.mark}]{.underline} on
Gordon [[by]{.underline}]{.mark} phenomenological
[**[ontology]{.underline}**. [Within this]{.underline}]{.mark}
[framework]{.underline}, and in line with philosophical (logical)
requirements, [[one **cannot simply move from description** to
**prescription**. Since phenomenology is **fundamentally descriptive**,
prescription gets **thrown out of the window**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
his own defense, Gordon claims that criticism from a Sartrean
perspective is misguided precisely because "the concern for a form of
prescriptive ethics on the basis of a Sartrean ontology reflects a
mistaken view of the Sartrean project, . . . since the role of the
philosopher . . . is not to be our shepherd" (1995a, 164).

At the ontological level, Gordon's position, just like Fanon's, becomes
radical ontology that emanates from the recognition of the importance of
contingency in existence. [[The **danger of committing ourselves to an
ontology** that **focuses exclusively** on **what must be the case**
resides in our **forgetfulness** of the **contingency of being** and
thus the **failure to appreciate** that what is the case **need not
always be**]{.mark} **the case**. [Liberation from **distorted
ontology**]{.mark}]{.underline}, therefore, [[requires the **rejection
of the kind of ontology** that is predicated on the **idea of
necessity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Instead, [[it **requires the
admission**]{.mark} of the fact [that **fundamentally**, the situation
**doesn't have to be as it is**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As mentioned
above, when existentialists ask, "What is the meaning of Being?," a
black consciousness raises the question: "What is the meaning of the
Being of a black person in an antiblack political, social, cultural,
religious and moral world?" [[Such an ontology has **liberatory
potential**]{.mark} precisely because humans **do indeed judge** that
the way things are in their lived political, social, and moral world is
**certainly not the way they ought to be**; that what is **need not be
as it is**. [From this judgment human beings do **set about to change
the way things are** to what they]{.mark} **must** and **[ought to
be]{.mark}**. It is [this]{.mark} realization that their situation
**need not be as it is**]{.underline}, as the epigraph above indicates,
[that [made the **Black Consciousness youth activists** question]{.mark}
the continuing [racism]{.mark} and hegemonic white supremacy
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} the "New" **[[South
Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Nelson Mandela.

### Perm

#### Even if pessimism is a good [academic]{.underline} stance, it [can't be used]{.underline} to justify [accepting the harms of the status quo]{.underline}---life is a [prerequisite]{.underline} to struggle

**Syedullah, 18**---Visiting Assistant Professor of Sociology at Vassar
College (Jasmine, "Afro-pessimism: Critical Exchange," Contemporary
Political Theory Vol. 17, 1, 105--137, dml)

[Given that the **endgame of Afro-pessimism** as an academic enterprise
is **limited by its location within the neoliberal
university**]{.underline} (see Fred Moten and Stephano Harney's ''The
University and the UnderCommons,''), [the **most generative aspects** of
its analysis]{.underline} of anti-blackness and Western civilization
[are indebted to knowledge about black life and liberation produced
**outside the academy** and on the ground of **struggles for
freedom**]{.underline}. The [pessimism]{.underline} of conventional
philosophical concern [presses on the **ontological foundations** of a
person's **individual sense of agency** and **purpose**, **throwing
one's will to live into question**]{.underline}.

Prophetic [despair]{.underline}, such as that which Baldwin expresses in
an often quoted interview between James Baldwin Dr. Kenneth Clark in May
of 1963, [presses on the **material cohesion of our moral
infrastructure**]{.underline}. In the interview [Baldwin professes to
**remaining pessimistic with regard to his own life**]{.underline} when
he says, ''It doesn't matter any longer what you do to me; you can put
me in jail, you can kill me. By the time I was 17, you'd done everything
that you could do to me. The problem now is, how are you going to save
yourselves?'' [He goes on a bit later to **refuse**, in **no uncertain
term**, pessimism as a **politics of the future**]{.underline}.

When Clark asks, ''Jim, what do you see deep in the recesses of your own
mind as the future of our nation, ... I think that the future of the
Negro and the future of the nation are linked ... What do you see?,''
[Baldwin replies, ''**I can't be a pessimist because I'm alive**. To be
a pessimist means that you have agreed that **human life is an academic
matter**, so I'm **forced to be an optimist**. I'm forced to believe
that **we can survive whatever we must survive**]{.underline}. But the
future of the Negro in this country is precisely as bright or as dark as
the future of the country (Clark et al., 1963).

I want to savor the tensions of Baldwin's response. I want to hold them,
not resolve them, and observe how they situate pedestrian personal
pessimism outside the movement for black life, while calling out the
limits of a political process propelled and legitimated by white
supremacy. [Even insofar as pessimism is a **social expression** of the
**affective limits of social death**, a feeling that **brings us back to
life**, **out of isolation**, and **into conversation with each other**
the promise of pessimism is clearly **far more than an academic
matter**.]{.underline}

[The **antithesis** of pessimism in this instance is not optimism but
**apathy**, **willful passive acceptance** of the **untenable
conditions** of a people systemically and forcibly made to understand
that there are some whose existence is at best immaterial and at worst a
clear and present danger]{.underline}, and then there are those lives
that do matter. What we have been witnessing in the activist and
academic movements for black life is the implosion of identity politics
and the failure of its possessive claims to liberal demands for rights
and protection. [The abolition of whiteness demands a kind of justice
the state **may not yet know how to sanction**]{.underline}. As Patrisse
Cullors (2015), one of three original founders of #BLM, argues, ''I
believe [we can't wait on the State to take care of our Black lives. We
have to **show up now** to **build the world we want to
see**]{.underline}.''

Thinking the purchase of the pessimistic prophetically then, as a
residual, inevitable, yet generative practice of the black prophetic
tradition with reparative properties that precede and exceed
Afro-pessimism's formal incorporation into scholarly journals and
conferences, I find myself constantly reminding my students that [while
we can **take the analysis of power** Afro-pessimism offers and **run
with it**, **academic enunciations** of pessimism **run the risk of
remaining loyal** to the **limits of legibility** and **respectability**
of politics as usual]{.underline}. As Nick Mitchell (forthcoming, p. 10)
writes: ''[When the **intellectual becomes interchangeable with the
slave**, it is perhaps **too easy**]{.underline} ... [to **smooth over
the fact** that black intellectuals have **interests as intellectuals
that can** and **do diverge** from those of the people for whom they
might want justice]{.underline}. Without an acknowledgement (not a
confession) of this divergence ... [the project]{.underline} of race
theorization [**risks deploying the generalizing force of theory** and
the **moralizing tendency of critique** to generalize a class
perspective]{.underline}.''

What [we are dealing with]{.underline} here is [more than]{.underline}
occidental anxiety of [ontological uncertainty. It is an **ethical
imperative** to engage in a struggle to **change the meaning of rights**
and **protection** from the ground up (or **suffer senselessly** at the
altar of the state's right to defend itself by any means
necessary)]{.underline}. As Baldwin (in Clark et al., 1963) suggested in
the interview with Kenneth Clark, the pessimism of antiblack racism is
not just a black problem, it presses on the condition of whites and upon
the country as a whole: ''These people have deluded themselves for so
long, that they really don't think I'm human. I base this on their
conduct, not on what they say, and this means that they have become, in
themselves, moral monsters.''

[The predicament of the pessimist is **not a personal problem** that is
easily selfcontained. It **presses upon the body**, **moving it to
unrest**]{.underline}, unleashing a rage that cannot stand to be at home
in moral monstrosity. [It **just wants to burn it all
down**]{.underline}. ''Now, we are talking about human beings, there's
not such a thing as a monolithic wall or some abstraction called the
Negro problem, these are Negro boys and girls, who at 16 and 17 don't
believe the country means anything that it says and don't feel they have
any place here, on the basis of the performance of the entire country.''
[The question Afro-pessimism poses]{.underline} as a practice of
prophetic desire then, [**turns away** from a politics of recognition
and respectability toward an **abolitionist praxis of fugitive
reparation** to ask, ''**Will you run with me?**'']{.underline} Does my
pessimism press on your sense of superiority, exception, perfection
enough for you to forfeit your status and help us move the country,
force the nation to believe there is freedom beyond this world, a more
prophetic imagination of difference, identity, and inclusion? ''What
white people have to do,'' Baldwin (in Clark et al., 1963) reminds us,
''is try and find out in their own hearts why it was necessary to have a
nigger in the first place, because I'm not a nigger, I'm a man, but if
you think I'm a nigger, it means you need it.''

In the present moment Black Lives Matter (**[BLM]{.underline}**) [is
**advancing the cause** for the abolition of white supremacy in local
ways in chapters throughout the world. They call us to **account for the
material consequences** of the unfinished work of antislavery abolition
and reconstruction]{.underline}. They are part of an underground lineage
of fugitive communities that emerged from the marshes, swamps, and
hiding spaces of the plantation South. [Their message is
**decentralized**. It is **not uniform**. It **does not reproduce old
antagonisms**. It **does not pit moral suasion against direct
confrontation**. It **does not ask** that we choose to remain **either
optimistic or pessimistic**. It **exercises a practice of the political
that harnesses both**]{.underline}. In this last section then I turn to
a speech against apathy by [Patrisse Cullors]{.underline}, a beacon in a
leader-full movement who [has been **animating pessimism as a protocol
of**]{.underline} self-care and prophetic [**political organizing**
powerful enough to propel activist and intellectual movements from
isolated places of loss into **collective liberation**, **out of
abstractions into objections**, subjecting the logics of antiblack
racism to the **collective force** of intersecting fugitive communities
of abolitionist movement **against nihilism** and toward an
**affirmation of life**]{.underline}.

We Can Survive? At age 25 on 19 April 2015 Freddie Gray died from
injuries sustained while shackled by his feet in a Baltimore Police
Department van where he was being held in custody following his arrest.
Baltimore stood up, rose up, died in, and rolled out. We all bore
witness. His death was deemed a murder by the medical examiner a few
weeks later. That Sunday morning, May 3, 2015, I, a Buddhist, found my
way to church, to All Saints in Pasadena, CA, into the strikingly
upper-class congregation of post-service attendees who piled in along
with an unlikely mix of young greater Los Angeles activists-of-color and
their white hipster allies. It would be my first time hearing our
speaker in person. The whole room stood and cheered as she entered --
the woman who helped coin the hashtag, the longtime activist organizer,
Patrisse Cullors greeted us like family, all knowing eyes, bright
smiles, and then began a talk she called ''Abolition Theology.'' Her
voice was clear and certain, free of the cross-bearing affect of black
suffering that often accompanies talk of state-sponsored antiblack
violence in predominately white spaces. Cullors gave us a speech that
touched us, that moved us -- mourning, rage and all -- into a mood for
collective action. She impressed upon us the fact that the movement for
black lives was a call to action for all black life, not just the names
we could recite, not just cisgendered young men, not just ''innocent''
''children,'' not just Americans. She let us know there had been recent
formations of #Black Lives Matter chapters beyond U.S. borders. There
were Afro-Latino chapters, chapters forming in Haiti, and in Ghana. She
reminded us that the concept of blackness that resonates across the
globe called on us to broaden the scope of our movements and to build
alliances, to build with Latino communities in particular. It was a call
for #BLM without borders. We were being enlisted in a movement that
began, she reminded us, with the movement to abolish the institution of
slavery. We were being reeducated as she drew connection between the
hard-won efforts of formerly fugitive abolitionists to build resilient
communities out of the so-called contraband during and following the
Civil War through to the present-day ''leader-full'' movement of #BLM.
''Isn't this a great time to be alive?'' Cullors asked in closing. Is
she joking I wondered? I found not one drop of cynicism in her question.
Without missing a beat, she proceeded to relay the names, the facts, the
numbers, the bodies felled by police, by gun, by force. As she listed
the lives taken a wave of loss flooded the room and we were still,
breathless. ''Protest is about disrupting apathy,'' she continued.

[She left us eager to join her in this]{.underline} twenty-first century
[**revival of reconstruction**, in a **fight for food**, for **access to
housing**, for **access to education**, and for a kind of justice for
black lives that **will not come** without our willingness to **show
up**, **stand up**, and **throw down**. In the streets, in
**solidarity**, we will **find the power to change people**, she said,
to **change policy**]{.underline}. She echoed the words of civil rights
organizer Ella Baker, ''[the system under which we now exist **has to be
radically changed**]{.underline}... [It means facing a system that does
not lend itself to your needs and **devising means by which you change
that system**.'']{.underline}

For Cullors [that ''means'' came by way of]{.underline} waves grief,
[**rage**, **despair**]{.underline}, the loss of family, [the **loss of
hope**]{.underline}, bearing witness, heartbreak, [and the **will to
return to face it all again**]{.underline}. She closed us out with the
rallying chant of the movement for black lives, the recitation of a
prayer by Twentieth century fugitive slave Assata Shakur, ''It is our
duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win. We must love each
other and protect each other. We have nothing to lose but our chains.''
The congregation's joy burst through the siren of her words and bound us
toward another way of sitting with the litany of loss.

We Must Survive

What Baldwin and Cullors make clear is that pessimism is most powerful
as an unrelenting political process of coming back to life, beginning to
feel one another's humanity. [What]{.underline} my
[students]{.underline} who are [taking up the work of Afro-pessimism are
**in most need of** are new ways to **put their pessimism to work**, to
**come together** and **collectively counteract the mind-numbing
soul-crushing isolation** centuries of antiblack racism have waged on
our humanity. We **need not fear falling short**. The more we
''**fail**,'' the **stronger we rise to try again** armed with the
alchemy of despair. What we need are **stories** and **speeches**, and
spaces that **moves us from abjection** toward that **fertile ground of
self-transformation** one can only find in the **witness of
another**]{.underline}. What might we give up in a move from critique to
healing and reparation, generative of the choice to be fearless in the
face of the impossibilities of freedom? What might the audacity to
''lean on each other,'' as Jasmine Abdullah Richards says in the
epigraph, and imagine a future for black life otherwise, add to the
pursuits of the pessimist?

### AT: Grammar Of Suffering

#### Social death is a [spectrum]{.underline}, not an [antagonism]{.underline}---Black suffering is [communicable]{.underline}.

**King Watts, 15**---Associate Professor, Media and Technology Studies,
UNC Chapel Hill (Eric, "Critical Cosmopolitanism, Antagonism, and Social
Suffering", Quarterly Journal of Speech Volume 101, Issue 1, 2015, dml)

[I have been asked]{.underline} by more than one graduate student at
more than one university [how]{.underline} I hope [to]{.underline}
[reconcile the claims of Afro-Pessimism with my insistence that [voice
is a fundamental]{.mark} human [capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}. I
maintain, more or less consistently, that [voice is a **public
occurrence** animated by the acknowledgment of the ethical and affective
dimensions of speech]{.underline}.16 [The repetition of the inquiry is
[**energized** by]{.mark} the fact and mode of [Afro-Pessimism being
taken]{.mark} [up in **debate**]{.mark}]{.underline} and argument
organizations, programs, and **[competitions]{.underline}**. I am not
going to attempt to complete this reconciliation in this space, in part
because I have not quite accomplished it. But I do have to briefly
sketch out the terms of the challenge in order to try to evaluate the
strengths and limits of critical cosmopolitanism as an academic practice
that would ask "why and how" Communication Studies might interact with
the Afro-Pessimistic enclave in Black Studies. While criticizing the
work of Black film theory, Frank Wilderson embarks upon an ambitious and
provocative campaign meant to foster an understanding of the conditions
of impossibility for Black subjectivity within the contemporary
ontological paradigm. The term "Afro-Pessimism" signals the work of
scholars who are "theorists of structural positionality."17 As such,
Blackness and Whiteness18 are interrogated as emerging through a
conjuncture with brutal modern technologies of organization and
domination, and the birth of the very idea of race. Put simply, it took
the modern invention of slavery and colonialism to bring about the
racial ideologies that make Blackness and Whiteness intelligible. The
Slave/Black, then, should not be considered exploited labor or simply
oppressed. "Rather, the gratuitous violence of the Black\'s first
ontological instance, the Middle Passage, 'wiped out \[his or her\]
metaphysics ... his or her customs and sources on which they are
based.'"19 The Black occupies a coordinate that marks a fundamental
structural antagonism with the West, with Whiteness and, indeed, with
the Human. It is quite easy to see why the term "Pessimism" is apt. The
Black names the condition of state violence, a flesh-object brought into
the world for "accumulation and fungibility."20 The Black is essential
to the production of Western subjectivity and to notions of what it
means to be human. "In short, White (Human) capacity, in advance of the
event of discrimination or oppression, is parasitic on Black incapacity:
Without the Negro, capacity itself is incoherent, uncertain at best."
[Not only is the Black incapacitated as a structural determinate, [the
Black is]{.mark} "a **[structural]{.mark} position of
[noncommunicability]{.mark}**."]{.underline}21 [[But **there
is**]{.mark} **a form of [communication]{.mark} here
[nevertheless]{.mark}** because the Black **paradoxically signifies the
"outside"** that **allows for the articulation of "anti-Black
solidarity."**]{.underline}22 [There is **theoretical** and **historical
support** for such an analysis]{.underline}. For example, [the early
twentieth-century Americanization projects used Blackness as an
exclusionary trope meant to help spur non-White immigrants]{.underline}
from Europe and Asia [toward Whiteness]{.underline}.23 [And here is
where]{.underline} the term "[Pessimism" **seems inadequate**. As a
structurally overdetermined body-image in the Western imaginary and
symbolic field, [Blackness **registers
near-nothingness**]{.mark}]{.underline}: [In perceiving Black folk as
being alive]{.underline}, or at least having the potential to live in
the world, the same potential that any subaltern might have, the
[politics]{.underline} of Black film theorists\' aesthetic methodology
and desire [disavowed the fact that "\[Black folk\] are **always already
dead**]{.underline} wherever you find them."24 [Given this dire
diagnosis]{.underline}, why and [how might we **interact with
Afro-Pessimism**? Speaking from the point of view of a **Black
rhetorical scholar**]{.underline} (and a scholar of Blackness), [the
answer to why is **virtually self-evident**: thinking through Blackness
as a **condition of possibility** for **rhetorical action** and **social
justice** is a **life-long pursuit** that]{.underline}, given the tragic
killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in August 2014, [feels
**especially burning**]{.underline}.25 [Given the **affective
intensity** of the charge of Black noncommunicability, **a failure to
meaningfully interact** would engender **a different kind of
"violence"**; in this case a **structural injunction** sponsored by
a]{.underline} lingering and [**recurring anxiety** regarding the
authority of Communication]{.underline} Studies. And [so how might we
interact]{.underline}? If I take up the orientation of critical
cosmopolitanism, [I need to recognize]{.underline} immediately [that [my
efforts can be **dismissed** ]{.mark}**by the Afro-Pessimist [as
colonial]{.mark}**]{.underline}; that is, as [a **reiteration** of
the]{.underline} sort of [practices that presume that one\'s
epistemologies can translate other\'s bodies of knowledge into
comprehensible]{.underline} and useful concepts and [constructs. And
[yet, **we must begin where we are**, **not where we hope to
be**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hence, I want to make two modest and one
not-so-modest suggestions for how Communication Studies in general and
Rhetorical Studies in particular might interact: first, [Wilderson calls
for "a new language of abstraction" to elaborate "[Blackness\'s grammar
of suffering]{.mark}."]{.underline}26 [But]{.underline} in my reading,
[Afro-Pessimism [is]{.mark} **already [too reliant]{.mark}** [on a
**language of abstraction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Lois McNay, in The
Misguided Search for the Political, recently contends that [theories of
political power are **overwrought** owing to a **social weightlessness**
brought about through **high abstraction**]{.underline}. She recommends
the reinvigoration of the concept of "social suffering"---not as an
entrenched category of victimage but, rather, as the habitus of lived
experience that must be articulated to analyses of structural
positionality.27 Second, I agree with McNay (who says nothing about
Afro-Pessimism, by the way) that [[**structural antagonisms are not
static**, but are **movable**]{.mark} and **moving configurations**. The
Afro-Pessimist]{.underline} in Wilderson\'s account [must agree that
[when a non-Black person is thrust toward the]{.mark} horrible
[condition approximating]{.mark}]{.underline} ([[but not identical
to]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[the Black\'s]{.mark} structural position,
[that]{.mark} adjustment [can]{.mark} **rightfully [be called a
"Blackening."]{.mark}** As a happening]{.underline}---and not an event
that has simply always already happened---[this racialized procedure
makes itself felt and knowable in the dense social fabric of the
everyday. If the Black is in a structural position that delimits the
impossibility of capacity, might we enjoin an analysis of the vocabulary
of that impossibility itself]{.underline}? And [since]{.underline} a
"[Blackening]{.underline}" [receives intelligibility from the structural
position of the Black, [might we gain some **productive**]{.mark}
[**understanding** from a scrutiny of]{.mark} key [discursive and
material forms of "Blackening"?]{.mark}]{.underline} [Was not Michael
Brown "Blackened" **in** and **through** (and **not only a priori to**)
his **bodily encounter with state violence**?]{.underline} Given my
ongoing scholarly interest in the Zombie, I am willing to concede that
[an Afro-Pessimist might claim that Brown was]{.underline}, at the
moment he was shot to death, "the dead but sentient thing, [the Black"
struggling "to articulate in a world of living subjects]{.underline}."28
[This concession functions as an assertion]{.underline}: the Zombie is
[not wholly outside Western intelligibility; it haunts the nether
regions between Human and Black]{.underline}. Its undead existence is
material and social, and supplies some vital resources for inventing a
new language---a grammar of (Black) suffering. Perhaps "there is no way
to Africa through the Black,"29 but maybe there is a route through the
Zombie. I have argued for such a project using the terminology of
reanimating Zombie voices.30 Lastly, we might think of this gloomy
predicament as a tenuous point of contact with Afro-Pessimism. Wilson\'s
intellectual history provides the basis for such a conception.
[Communication]{.underline} Studies has been (and continues to anguish
over the extent that it still is) in the structural position of inferior
and alienated. There should be no shame in admitting that the
discipline, in relation to both the Social Sciences and the Humanities,
has been and is subject to being "Blackened." Indeed, its originary
moment, as I alluded to above, [meant the rejection of a set
of]{.underline} nationalistic [proprietary politics that treated Speech
teachers like disposable labor]{.underline}. By any reasonable measure,
that structural positioning---despite the fact that the people involved
were White---was a racialization, a "Blackening." Let\'s be perfectly
clear: [there is **no identification** being made here with the
**fundamental antagonism** associated with the Black]{.underline}.
However, [this]{.underline} racialized politics (among other political
registers) [might provide a **new critical vocabulary** for
Communication scholars if we do the **painful work** of **coming to
grips** with the **discursive** and **material practices** of
"Blackening." [There are **structures of different
scales**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Academic structural dynamics are **not
dissociated** from the identity ideologies implicated in]{.underline}
nationalism and cosmopolitanism, [citizenship and exile, privilege and
destitution, Whiteness and Blackness. Indeed, Wilderson\'s critique is
**launched from** and **resides within those very same structural
dynamics**]{.underline}. It seems to me then that, at the very least,
[our **[shared social suffering]{.mark}** with Afro-Pessimism---although
[of **vastly different magnitudes**]{.mark} and **qualities**---[should
be asserted as]{.mark} **a mode of [transnational
fidelity]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

### AT: End The World

#### \[[Their method]{.mark}\] leaves current political coordinates [intact]{.underline} at [best]{.underline} and [strengthens]{.underline} them at [worst]{.underline}. Analogy and solidarity are [good]{.underline}.

**O'Donnell, 20**---Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Oakton
Community College (Patrick, "Ontology, Experience, and Social Death: On
Frank Wilderson's Afropessimism,"
<https://philpapers.org/archive/ODOOEA.pdf>, dml)

Finally, [it is worth discussing the **political upshots** of
Afropessimism]{.underline}, and how the book "reads" within our current
political moment. Wilderson's own political stance is clear enough in
its broad outlines: [Black liberation requires the **total destruction**
of the existing relation between Slaves and Humans]{.underline}. In one
of the book's more hopeful moments, Wilderson grants that "social
death," like class and gender, can be overcome, since it is ultimately
"constructed by the violence and imagination of other sentient beings."
[Overcoming social death]{.underline}, however, [is necessarily
**apocalyptic**]{.underline}: "The first step toward the destruction is
to assume one's position... and then burn the ship or the plantation, in
its past and present incarnations, from the inside out" (103).
[Afropessimism proposes a political ethic for those **outside**
politics, whose engagement with the political would signify the **end**
of politics as we know it]{.underline}.

[Wilderson's political vision is a "**grenade without a pin**," or a
"**looter's creed**" which strives to bring about the Fanonian "**end of
the world**"]{.underline} (174). Yet [if your politics requires you to
"**burn the ship** or the **plantation**]{.underline}.... [from the
**inside out**" with **yourself inside**, you should be **extremely
sure** that this politics is rooted in a **true** and **comprehensive**
vision of Black people's situation in the world. Pinless grenades and
looter's creeds can **fall into anyone's hands**. They can **harm
countless bystanders**. Their **volatility** makes them
**unpredictable**. What if the theoretical conceits of Afropessimism not
only **fail** to bring about the end of the world, but give **succor**
to projects dedicated to making an **already awful** anti-Black world
**worse**?]{.underline} Ironically, [those with **reactionary**
anti-Black politics, or those]{.underline} in thrall to the magic of
Whiteness and [**convinced** of the subhumanity of Blackness, should
**appreciate** the work that Wilderson accomplishes here. In **fascist
hands**, a claim like "it is **absolutely necessary** for Blacks to
be]{.underline} castrated, raped, genitally mutilated and
**[violated]{.underline}**, beaten, shot, and maimed" [in order for
non-Blacks to achieve "confirmation of Human existence" is **just the
sort of work** a society running on the myth of Black inhumanity and
subpersonhood **requires**]{.underline}.

More predictably, [Afropessimism **takes aim** at leftist coalitional,
solidarity-based, and intersectional politics]{.underline}. [It is not
just that historically existing forms]{.underline} of socialism,
feminism, and multiculturalism [have left Black people out (which they
often have). Rather, in Wilderson's mind, these forms of politics
**terrorize** Black people simply by **positing analogies** and
**similarities** among diverse forms of Black and non-Black
oppression]{.underline} (220). [The **monolithic view** of Blackness
Afropessimism presents seems to have **little room** for the idea that
Black people are **lots of things besides Black**, and that their
interests and concerns are often formed in ways **similar** to
non-Blacks' interests]{.underline}. To be sure, we should mark a
distinction between Wilderson's politics and misappropriations of his
vision. Yet [if Black people are **literally terrorized** by
working-class struggle, multicultural coalitions, immigration rights,
feminism, and other forms of counter-hegemonic politics, one might
wonder why Black liberation strategies should **bother** accommodate the
stated interests of people who are, in **addition** to Black, queer,
religious, anti-capitalist, female, poor, immigrant, working class,
indigenous, and/or incarcerated]{.underline}.

[Those sympathetic to Wilderson might suggest that Black people have
**little to lose** by abandoning solidarity-based politics. Yet
**not-so-ancient history** suggests that there may be **higher stakes**
here]{.underline}. As Paul Ortiz (2018) has recently demonstrated,
[**many** of the **material**, **political**, **social**, and **symbolic
gains** for Black and Latinx people throughout the 18th and 19th
centuries were generated by an emancipatory internationalism that **drew
explicit analogies** between Black and non-Black freedom
struggles]{.underline}. The United States' interest in [slavery of
course **first** and **foremost** oppressed Black people. Yet because
slavery was **so deeply interwoven** with the oppression of non-Black
people as well]{.underline} (in the form of Indian removal and
extermination, violent expropriation of Mexican land in a war to expand
slavery, etc.), [Black and non-Black abolitionists were able to engage
the problem of Black oppression **not in isolation**, but with a view to
how it undergirded a **more generally unacceptable** social
order]{.underline}. Of course, [just because solidarity **was** a useful
tool]{.underline} for achieving those political goals [doesn't mean it
will work **now**. Yet in a time when Black oppression has once again
become one of the **clearest symptoms** of a more broadly unacceptable
social order, perhaps it is **wise** to remember this emancipatory
spirit]{.underline}.

Finally, [one wouldn't think that a political imaginary that at first
seems so radical would be **so amenable** to the **status
quo**]{.underline}. Wilderson suggests that his view of the fundamental
distinctiveness of Black suffering extends "the critique of
neoliberalism," and registers surprise that leftists do not welcome his
perspective (182). Yet [it is]{.underline} just as [easy to see
Afropessimism's **performative transcendence** of the political as
embracing a **neoliberal class politics**]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} book's [**simplistic social ontology** and
**monolithic conception** of violence makes **each** Black person into
**All Black People**, thus aiding a **crucial neoliberal elision**: even
if Wilderson **draws no essential distinction** in station and suffering
among Black people, the **market certainly does** and **will continue**
to do so]{.underline}. Afropessimism's Sturm und Drang is often a
pleasure to explore, but [it fits right in with a masochistic cultural
moment that **cedes the floor** to public proclamations of suffering and
rituals of deference to it while simultaneously **cordoning off** these
performances from **any political will** to eradicate the causes of such
suffering in the first place. Performing catharsis itself **may** be a
political act, but it is increasingly one whose relation to subversive
strategies is **not always clear**]{.underline}. Whether had by
feminists, anti-racists, anti-capitalists, or Afropessimists, [the small
pleasures of lamentation **do not threaten**]{.underline}. One imagines
the dominant social order quoting Nietzsche to itself: "'what are my
parasites to me?, it might say, 'may they live and prosper: I am strong
enough for that!'" (Nietzsche 1967: 72).

In a final irony, [perhaps Afropessimism is **not pessimistic
enough**]{.underline}. We occupy a stultifying political moment whose
routines have been so corporatized that even avowed anti-racists must
negotiate racism roughly the same way a human resources department must
negotiate an unruly employee: correct, cancel, or cash in, depending on
what the cost-benefit analysis says. As a result, self-congratulatory
anti-bias training, identification with the "right side of history" (on
which side of course can be found the most "socially conscious"
brand-name corporations), underclass tourism, performative wokeness,
cyclical rituals of call out and contrition, and perhaps a "diversity
initiative" here and there seem to be the only intellectual and
practical tools current institutions are willing to raise against the
nexus of racial and socioeconomic oppression. [Wilderson]{.underline} of
course recognizes that racism is a deep feature of the social order, and
so is rightly pessimistic about the efficacy of the usual "anti-racist"
tools. But he [may be right for the **wrong reason**: pessimism about
the end of racism isn't warranted because Black suffering **necessarily
anchors** the world, it's warranted because it is **nigh-impossible** to
imagine a future world **so thoroughly reorganized** around the
well-being of the dispossessed that racism and anti-racism themselves
have ceased to be useful strategies for consolidating and protecting
elite power and wealth]{.underline}. Perhaps [this is the source of the
unsettling feeling that Wilderson's tools might simply be
**retrofitted** to the **neoliberal apparatus**]{.underline}. The
content of [Wilderson's version of Afropessimism]{.underline} makes it a
stranger cousin than most, but its [uptake in the mainstream may signal
**neoliberal politics as usual**: a **lucrative** but **politically
impotent** brokerage relationship between elites willing to **monetize
Black suffering** and its **supposed antidote**, and the audiences
**happy to consume both**]{.underline}.³

### AT: Libidinal Economy/Psychoanalysis

#### Wilderson's theory of the political relies on lacanian psychoanalysis -- which isn't based in any falsifiable evidence

**Billig 6** (Michael, prof social psych @ Loughbourgh U "Lacan\'s
Misuse of Psychology : Evidence, Rhetoric and the Mirror Stage" Theory
Culture Society 2006 23: 1)

It has been noted that [[Lacan makes a distinction between]{.mark} the
'[facts']{.mark} of the mirror stage [and his theoretical
interpretations]{.mark} of those apparent facts]{.underline}. [The
emphasis here has been upon examining the 'facts', rather than on
Lacan's theoretical interpretations.]{.underline} [[It is assumed that
if the facts are thrown into doubt, then the]{.mark} validity of the
[interpretation is]{.mark} substantially [weakened]{.mark}.]{.underline}
This assumption can be held to reflect a general feature of psychology.
[[Psychological concepts need to be grounded in observations]{.mark} of
human actions**. They cannot**,]{.underline} or, rather, they should
not, **[be constructed out of pure theory]{.underline}**. Crucially,
Lacan recognizes this. Hence he begins this theorizing about the
splitting of the ego with evidential claims about what the child does in
front of the mirror. Such behaviour provides the reason for thinking
that something hidden and essentially unobservable might be occurring
psychologically. Thus[, Lacan's theorizing about the ideal image is
grounded in claims about observable actions. **[He does not
present]{.mark}** further [**evidence to support his speculations**
about the mirror image providing the child]{.mark} with [an idealized
image]{.mark}]{.underline}. To the extent that the grounding is
weakened, then so are the speculations, at least as possible
descriptions of what occurs in the mind of the child. Without such
grounding, psychological concepts become vague, spinning round in
self-contained theoretical loops and never coming down to earth. It is
arguable that many cultural theorists use Lacanian concepts in ways that
are, at best, metaphorical and, at worst, disconnected from specific
human activity[. [What is needed is a form of critical psychology that
is more clearly anchored in human activity]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is
why a change in the mirror trope -- from the visual mirror image to the
activity of mirroring -- might have psychological significance. It would
draw attention to the way that development occurs through imitation. The
actions of the parents are virtually absent in Lacan's account, as
indeed they are in much of Freud's writing on infant development (see
Billig, 2005: ch. 7, for details). It is as if children independently
create their own inner psychological world, rather than being
encouraged, even bullied, to mirror the repression and the order of the
social world that surrounds them.

#### Libidinal explanations for racism are too sweeping to carry analytic value.

**Hook, 21**---Associate Professor of Psychology at Duquesne University
(Derek, "Pilfered pleasure: on racism as "the theft of enjoyment","
*Lacan and Race: Racism, Identity, and Psychoanalytic Theory*, Chapter
2, pg 36-39, dml)

[What is]{.underline} immediately **[striking]{.underline}** in these
extracts [is the role played by **affect**]{.underline}, or more
accurately yet, by [the]{.underline} "**[pained
stimulation]{.underline}**" [of]{.underline} the aroused passions of
**[enjoyment]{.underline}**. What both authors highlight---and this
speaks to the analytical value of the concept---is that forms of excess
stimulation (the "negative pleasure" of jouissance) underlie and propel
Symbolic and political constructions of otherness. Different cultural
modes of enjoyment are, furthermore, fundamentally discordant. [We
have]{.underline} then not so much a "Clash of Civilizations"---to
reference the Samuel Huntington's (1997) much cited thesis---as [a
**clash** of enjoyments]{.underline}.

Moreover, [the difficulty that we have in realizing]{.underline} "full"
[enjoyment]{.underline}---something that is impossible in Lacanian
theory for "castrated" speaking beings---[is dealt with by imagining the
**supposedly unimpaired** and **inevitably disturbing enjoyment**
possessed by]{.underline} cultural/racial/sexual
**[others]{.underline}**. In short, the fact that we cannot attain the
jouissance we feel we deserve results in perceptions of an unhindered,
illegitimate, and undeserved enjoyment on the part of others. As Sheldon
George notes: "the other's jouissance, or enjoyment, \[is\] ... the very
core around which ... otherness articulates itself" (2016: 3). Political
jealousy, as Žižek calls it, is thus (at least in part) the result of
incompatibilities and more importantly yet, perceived sacrifices of
jouissance.

Jouissance: unserviceable tool of political analysis?

Despite having offered only a brief introduction to the above Lacanian
ideas, [[we should **pause**]{.underline}]{.mark} here for a moment [[to
voice a number of]{.underline}]{.mark} prospective [**methodological**
and **conceptual [problems]{.mark}** implied [by the racism
as]{.mark}]{.underline} (**[theft of]{.underline}**) [[**enjoyment**
thesis]{.underline}]{.mark}. Doing so will help us focus the expository
comments to follow, and indeed, to highlight the potential analytical
advantages the thesis may have to offer.

The first critique, which applies to a wide historical range of
psychoanalytic theories of racism (see Cohen, 2002; Frosh 1989;
Stavrakis 1999), is that of psychological reductionism. Simply put: [the
[**complexity** of]{.mark} the various
**[historical]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[discursive]{.underline}**,
[and **socioeconomic causes**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of racism [are
**invariably deprioritized**]{.mark} and accorded a **peripheral
explanatory** role once [the]{.mark} domain of the [**psychological** is
**privileged**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Accounts]{.underline}]{.mark} [of
the psychological factors underlying various instances of racism
[are]{.mark} thus not only [**de-historicizing** and]{.mark}
**hopelessly [generalizing]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [they are also
**invariably depoliticizing**]{.underline}.

A second critique: [[is jouissance not]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[hopelessly [open-ended]{.mark}]{.underline}** concept? [Virtually
**any cultural behaviour**]{.underline}, [**bodily intensity** or
**[libidinal activity]{.mark}** can]{.underline}, it seems, [be
considered]{.underline} to be [an instance of jouissance]{.underline}.
[In view of racism]{.underline}, for example, [the other's enjoyment can
[refer to **everything** from]{.mark}]{.underline} their
incomprehensible **[[cultur]{.mark}al customs]{.underline}** and/or
**[religious beliefs]{.underline}** (epitomized, for example, in odd
food and dress restrictions), [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} perceived
aspects of their distinctive
[physicality]{.underline}/[sensuality]{.underline} (their
**[[food]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the way they
**[[dance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the sound of their
**[[music]{.underline}]{.mark}**), to attributions of superabundant
vitality (they are excessively promiscuous, religious, lazy, etc.)? [The
concept]{.underline} of jouissance [seems]{.underline} thus to be [both
**underdifferentiated** and **overly inclusive**]{.underline}, [applying
to a **potentially endless array** of behaviors and
experiences]{.underline}. [Without a **clearer sense** of how to
differentiate what **qualifies** as enjoyment and what does
**not**]{.underline}, [the concept **[loses analytical
value]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

A third line of critique: [**different modes** of enjoyment are
implied]{.underline} within the literature, [without being **properly
distinguished**]{.underline}. In Žižek's descriptions of racism and
jouissance, for example, [jouissance is used **broadly** to refer
to]{.underline}: [**visceral** or **passionate** modes of
experience]{.underline} (the "thrill of **[hate]{.underline}**"); an
[array of **enviable possessions**]{.underline} (our "**[libidinal
treasures]{.underline}**") perceived as under threat by cultural others;
[and]{.underline} a type of noxious "**[surplus vitality]{.underline}**"
possessed by such others. So, [whose enjoyment are we **most
fundamentally concerned** with]{.underline} in these notions of racism
as jouissance, the other's, or our own? What is the relationship between
these two types of jouissance? And how are they related to a third mode,
namely the "negative pleasure" of making---experiencing---such troubling
attributions in the first place?

Fourth, there is ever-present problem of
[de-contextualization]{.underline} in "shorthand" applications of the
term. This [leads to a situation in which enjoyment]{.underline} itself
[is treated as a **causative force beyond adequate consideration**
of]{.underline} a series of accompanying concepts (the frame of fantasy,
the operation of the signifier, [the [role of]{.mark} the
**[law]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the "object a" as cause of desire) that
necessarily accompany its proper psychoanalytic application. What
[**auxiliary terms** [must]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[be
utilized]{.mark} alongside the concept if it is to serve us [as a
**viable**]{.mark} **analytical [tool]{.mark}**]{.underline}?

Critique 1: the notion of enjoyment as psychologically reductionist

There is a crucial passage that is repeated in a number of Žižek's
earlier books (1992, 1993, 2005) and that serves as perhaps his most
direct exposition of racism as the theft of enjoyment:

What is at stake in ethnic tensions is always \[a kind of \] possession:
the "other" wants to steal our enjoyment (by ruining our "way of life")
and/ or he has access to some secret, perverse enjoyment. In short, what
gets on our nerves, what really bothers us about the "other" is the
peculiar way he organizes his enjoyment (the smell of his food, his
"noisy" songs and dances, his strange manners, his attitudes to
work---in the racist perspective, the "other" is either a workaholic
stealing our jobs or an idler living on our labour)" (1992: 165).

While this seems, in many ways, a gripping account, from a sociologist
or historian's perspective[, the [degree of reductionism is
**staggering**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The **[multiple [complex]{.mark}
sociological]{.underline}**, **[economic]{.underline}**, [and
**socio-historical [variables]{.mark}** underlying distinctive
historical forms of racism [are **brushed aside** in favor of]{.mark} a
**[generalizing psychoanalytic formula]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Racism =
reaction to perception that the]{.underline} (perversely enjoying)
[other has stolen our enjoyment]{.underline}. This reduction of racism
to an affective equation is evident also in Žižek's precursor in this
conceptual domain, Jacques-Alain Miller:

Why does the Other remain Other? What is the cause for our hatred of
him, for our hatred of him in his very being? It is hatred of the
enjoyment in the Other. This would be the most general formula for the
modern racism we are witnessing today: a hatred of a particular way the
Other enjoys ... The question of tolerance or intolerance is ... located
on the level of tolerance or intolerance toward the enjoyment of the
Other, the Other who essentially steals my own enjoyment (Miller, cited
in Žižek 1993: 203).

[The **depoliticization**]{.underline} (indeed, the implicit
psychologization) [inherent in such a conceptual move is
**surprising**]{.underline} inasmuch it is something that Žižek has
proved critical of elsewhere. In a 1998 text, for example, Žižek
outlines the charge of psychological reductionism against standard
[psychoanalytic explanations of racism]{.underline}, which offer

a way of explaining racism that **[ignore]{.underline}** ... [not only
racism's **socioeconomic conditions** but the **sociosymbolic context**
of cultural values and identifications]{.underline} that generate
reactions to the experience of ethnic otherness (1988: 154).

Surely this also applies to the racism as theft of enjoyment formula
outlined above? [[Explanations]{.mark} of racism as jouissance
are]{.underline} surely [prone to **psychological
reductionism**]{.underline} inasmuch as [they]{.underline} often appear
to [[privilege]{.mark} a series of [psychoanalytic
assumptions]{.mark}]{.underline} (**[drive]{.underline}**,
**[fantasy]{.underline}**, [**[libido]{.underline}**,
**[projection]{.underline}**]{.mark}, etc.) [as existing **prior**
to]{.underline}---[or [**independently**
of]{.mark}]{.underline}---[considerations of
**[economic]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[historical]{.underline}**,
**[political]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [and **socio-symbolic
[context]{.mark}**]{.underline}?

#### Psychoanalysis isn't universal and scaling it up to political conclusions is colonialist.

**Rogers, 17**---Senior Lecturer in Criminology in the School of
Political Sciences at the University of Melbourne and Adjunct Professor
at Griffith Law School, Queensland (Juliet, "Is Psychoanalysis
Universal? Politics, Desire, and Law in Colonial Contexts," Political
Psychology, Vol. 38, No. 4, 2017, dml)

[[The **presumption of**]{.mark} **a [universal]{.mark} form of
[desire]{.mark}** [is an important starting point]{.mark} for the
analyst]{.underline} of any patient who arrives on the couch in the
psychoanalytic clinic. The psychoanalyst can only offer certain
parameters, with all their limitations. The patient, if the analyst
allows for an interrogation of their own forms of resistance, however,
can speak back to any frame of desire that the analyst presumes or
proposes. And the analyst---if Jacques Lacan's thoughts on resistance
are taken seriously (Lacan, 2007, p. 497; Rogers, 2016, pp.
183--187)---must listen, attend, learn, and adapt. But [when the desires
of subjects are **extended into the political realm**, when the wants
and needs of every subject are **presumed to articulate** with a
**psychoanalytic notion of universal desire**, then **something is
lost**]{.underline}. That something might be called the desire of the
other, or it might not be called desire at all.

The desire of the other is not easily seen in the wake of European
Enlightenment that has engulfed the imagination of psychoanalytic and
political theorists and practitioners alike. It is not easily seen, and
it is not easily conversed with when epistemological work presumes a
trajectory of desire and then applies it. In this application, [[there
is **little space** for a **radically other**]{.mark} **performance** of
[politics]{.mark} as action or imagination [to appear]{.mark}. [The
subject]{.mark} who is subsumed into this imagination]{.underline}---the
subject Gayatri Spivak (1996)1 describes as "the Other of
Europe"---[[has **little opportunity to do more** than "**utter**" under
the weight of its imagined subjectivity]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Spivak
(1999) says:

[\[I\]n the constitution of that Other of Europe, **great care** was
taken to **obliterate the textual ingredients** with which such a
subject could cathect, could occupy (invest?) its
itinerary]{.underline}---not only by ideological and scientific
production, but also by the institution of the law. (p. 266)

[Psychoanalysis is **as guilty** of exercising such a form of "**great
care**"]{.underline} as many of the occupations of French intellectuals
that Spivak has criticized for doing so.
[[Psychoanalysis]{.underline}]{.mark}, with its attention to the many
forms of the unconscious, can appear otherwise than guilty of this. It
can appear more open, generous, and curious about the many forms that
desire can take. In its later forms of attention to a politically
constituted "symbolic order" under the guidance of Lacan (2007), it can
also appear more attentive to the particularities of desires informed by
a politics of the time. I argue here, however, that attention [is
**already constituted** by an imagination of a subject who wants, who
needs, who desires objects, things, rights, in a mode which **[cannot
not start from]{.mark} a point of origin**, and [a **particular
political form of origin** which then **precludes the
recognition**]{.mark}]{.underline}---in both the clinic and in political
analysis2 ---[[of **other forms of desire**]{.underline}]{.mark}, "with
which such a subject could cathect, could occupy (invest?) its
itinerary." [When practices such as political psychoanalysis **presume a
particular form of desire**, [what is at stake]{.mark} in this
constitution of desire [is the **political subject**]{.mark} or [the
**Other**]{.mark} **of Europe** [who cannot
"speak,"]{.mark}]{.underline} in Spivak's terms. [[What is lost]{.mark}
might be called **radical desire**; it might be an **itinerary which is
cathected** or **invested otherwise**, and]{.underline}, as such, [it
[**might not be recognizable** in psychoanalysis]{.mark} or in
contemporary political psychology at all]{.underline}.

[The nonrecognition of the Other of Europe, in her many forms, is a
**consistent political problem**]{.underline}---documented often and
insistently by critical race and postcolonial analysts such as Spivak,
but also Sanjay Seth, Leila Gandhi, Chandra Talpade Mohanty, Aileen
Moreton-Robinson, Elizabeth Povinelli, Ashis Nandy, Christine Black, and
Homi Bhabha. [Such nonrecognition]{.underline}, however, [when
**repostulated in political psychoanalysis** has another effect. The
trajectory of the symptoms of political
practice]{.underline}---including desires for law, justice, particular
election outcomes, rights, socioeconomic configurations, or even for the
formation of political structures themselves (democracy being only
one)--- [presume a form of desire that **refers to**, and **endures
in**, its constitution]{.underline}. As Spivak (1999) notes in her
critique of power and desire as universal:

\[S\]o is "desire" misleading because of its paleonomic burden of an
originary phenomenal passion---from philosophical intentionality on the
one hand to psychoanalytic definitive lack on the other. (p. 107)

The psychoanalytic definitive lack she speaks of refers to the Lacanian
configuration of desire as always attempting to recover, to master, to
instantiate an identity that is supposedly interminably lost as soon as
language acts upon the subject. [This **[lack]{.mark}** is inaugurated
through the subjects relation to what it cannot have]{.underline}, or,
in Spivak's terms, the "originary phenomenal passion" referring to the
oedipal scene, [which [is **presumed**]{.mark} **to be [the origin of
desire for all]{.mark}**[. This]{.mark} configuration of desire
**renders all subjects** desiring of overcoming that lack. But it [is a
**particular form of desire** and]{.mark} a **particular quality of
[lack]{.mark}**[. The presumption of this
quality]{.mark}]{.underline}---the presumption about what and how people
desire---I argue here, [[**must be accountable** to]{.mark} the
[**politico-historical configurations** which]{.mark} have produced
it]{.underline}.

[Politico-historical configurations, [**by definition**, are **not
universal**]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is, contra Zizek (2006), I argue
that [[**not all the world is a symptom**, but]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[any psychoanalysis of a **political symptom**]{.mark}, of a
**political [subject]{.mark}**[, or]{.mark} of the [desires]{.mark}
examined through psychoanalysis as they **emerge [in a political
arena]{.mark}**[, assume a **particular formation**]{.mark} **of
desire**]{.underline}. And that such an analysis operates within the
parameters and employs the understandings of the oedipal scene, or,
simply of a subjectivity split by language, including the language of
law. As Lacan (2006) says "language begins along with law" (p. 225).
While [this split subjectivity **may appear to be
universal**]{.underline}---and is convincingly employed as such by
psychoanalytic and political theorists, and often philosophers (Butler,
1997; Epstein, 2013; Zevnik, 2016; Zizek, 2006), [this]{.underline}
splitting [**refers specifically** to]{.underline} an oedipal lineage,
[as a **particular instantiation** of]{.underline} Oedipal Law, and, as
I argue positive law as [a liberal law concerned with rights and with
what once can or cannot have from the polis]{.underline} as much as what
one can take from the father. Thus the "originary phenomenal passion,"
which a psychoanalysis of the political engages, always refers back as I
will explain, to a (primal) father as a sovereign in a wrangle with his
sons, a scene which itself cannot not be understood without its
resonances to the French Revolution.

In particular, we argue that capitalism is currently undergoing a global
reorganization based on new technologies and a transnational corporate
restructuring and that consequently our contemporary moment is between a
disorganized and reorganized capitalism, a situation that requires
intense focus both on political economy and on technology and culture.
Part of this transformation involves new functions for the state, as
well as the loss of national sovereignty to transnational forces, and
the creation of new identities and experiences. But we believe that
**[[Baudrillard is wrong when he says that we are no longer within a
disciplinary society]{.mark}, or a society of the spectacle, [but are
completely within]{.mark} a fully processed
[simulatory]{.mark},]{.underline}** cybernetic, **[postmodern
[society]{.mark}]{.underline}** where distinctions such as those between
subject and object, appearance and reality, surface and depth, and so
on, are obliterated. Just as a feudal mode of production can coexist

#### Political activism is affective -- 65 years of empirics prove that creating new public interpretations of how violence operates makes material changes

**Berinsky 7**, Adam J. professor of political science at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "Assuming the Costs of War:
Events, Elites, and American Public Support for Military Conflict,"
Journal of Politics, Volume 69, Issue 4, pages 975--997, November 2007

Many political scientists and policymakers argue that unmediated
events---the successes and failures on the battlefield---determine
whether the mass public will support military excursions. The public
supports war, the story goes, if the benefits of action outweigh the
costs of conflict. Other [scholars contend that the balance of elite
discourse influences public support for war. [I draw upon survey
evidence from World War II and]{.mark} the]{.underline} current [war in
[Iraq to come to a common conclusion regarding public support
for]{.mark} international [interventions]{.mark}]{.underline}. I find
little evidence that citizens make complex cost/benefit calculations
when evaluating military action. Instead, [I find that patterns of elite
conflict shape opinion concerning war. [When political elites
**disagree** ]{.mark}**as to the wisdom of intervention, [the public
divides]{.mark}** [as well]{.mark}]{.underline}. But when elites come to
a common interpretation of a political reality, the public gives them
great latitude to wage war.¶ In recent years, a charitable view of the
mass public has emerged in the public opinion and foreign policy
literature. Increasingly, scholars have attributed "rationality" to
public opinion concerning war. Many political scientists and
policymakers argue that unmediated events---the successes and failures
on the battlefield---determine whether the mass public will support
military excursions. The public supports war, the story goes, if the
benefits of action outweigh the costs of conflict and should therefore
have a place at the policymaking table.¶ In this paper, I argue that
military events may shape public opinion, but not in the straightforward
manner posited by most scholars of public opinion and war. I draw upon
and expand the work of scholars who contend that the balance of elite
discourse influences levels of public support for war. [[Integrating
**research on heuristics** ]{.mark}**and shortcuts** [with
**information-based theories of political choice**, I demonstrate
that]{.mark}]{.underline} patterns of conflict among partisan political
actors shape mass opinion on war. It is not the direct influence of
wartime events on individual citizens\' decisions that determines public
opinion, as "event response" theories of war support claim. Instead,
consistent with the "elite cue" theory I advance in this paper, [the
nature of [conflict]{.mark} among political elites [concerning the
**salience and meaning of**]{.mark} those **[events determines if the
public will rally to war.]{.mark}**]{.underline} To a significant degree
citizens determine their positions on war by listening to trusted
sources---those politicians who share their political predispositions.¶
I present [[evidence from World War II and the Second Iraq
war]{.underline}]{.mark}, two cases that span 65 years of American
history, to come to this common conclusion. In both wars, I find that
significant segments of the mass public possessed little knowledge of
the most basic facts of these conflicts. Thus, there is little evidence
that citizens had the information needed to make cost/benefit
calculations when deciding whether to support or oppose military action.
Instead, [I [find that patterns of elite conflict **shaped opinions**
both **throughout**]{.mark}]{.underline} the six years of World War II
and during the Iraq conflict. When elites come to a common
interpretation of a political reality, [[the public gives them great
latitude to wage war.]{.mark}]{.underline} But when prominent political
actors take divergent stands on the wisdom of intervention, the public
divides as well. Furthermore, even in cases---such as the Iraq
war---where prominent political actors on one side of the partisan
divide stay silent, the presence of a prominent partisan cue giver can
lead to divergence in opinion. In sum, while members of the mass public
are not lemmings---they have agency to determine their own opinion and
may even, in the aggregate, reasonably react to changing events---in the
realm of war, any apparent rationality arises largely through the
process of elite cue taking, not through a reasoned cost/benefit
analysis. The mass public is rational only to the extent that prominent
political actors provide a rational lead.

### Anti-War Activism---2NC

#### Anti-war activism is affective -- empirical studies done on public opinion and the influence of the media from World War 2 all the way up to the Iraq war prove that the opinion of elites structures public consensus, and that only by using our power as advocates to shift those opinions can create the social transitions necessary to stop global military interventionism. 

#### The impact is [sanitization]{.underline}---that allows policy-makers to [coopt poststructural concepts]{.underline} to [justify interventions gone wrong]{.underline} while doing nothing to change the squo.

\[Note: CSS = "Critical Security Studies"\]

Conclusion¶ This article has argued that the appendage 'critical' should
be removed to allow Security Studies to free itself of the baggage of
its founding. It is clear that what little emancipatory content critical
security theorising had initially has been more than exhausted and, in
fact, thoroughly critiqued. The boom in CSS in the 1990s and early 2000s
was essentially parasitical on the shift in Western policy discourses,
which emphasised the radical and emancipatory possibilities of power,
rather than on the basis of giving theoretical clarity to
counter-hegemonic forces.¶ We would argue that the removal of the prefix
'critical' would also be useful to distinguish security study based on
critique of the world as it exists from normative theorising based on
the world as we would like it to be. As long as we keep the ['[critical'
nomenclature]{.mark}]{.underline}, [we are affirming [that]{.mark}
government]{.underline} and international [[policy-making can be]{.mark}
understood and [critiqued against the goal of emancipating the]{.mark}
non-Western [Othe]{.mark}r]{.underline}. Judging policy-making and
policy outcomes, on the basis of this imputed goal,
[[may]{.underline}]{.mark} provide 'critical' theorists with endless
possibilities to [[demonstrate]{.mark} their [**normative standpoints**
but **it does little to develop** ]{.mark}**academic and [political
understandings of the world]{.mark}**]{.underline} we live in.¶ In fact,
no greater straw\[person\] man could have been imagined, than the
ability to become 'critical' on the basis of debates around the claim
that the West was now capable of undertaking emancipatory policy
missions. Today, as we witness a narrowing of transformative aspirations
on behalf of Western policy elites, in a reaction against the 'hubris'
of the claims of the 1990s (Mayall and Soares de Oliveira 2012) and a
slimmed down approach to sustainable, 'hybrid' peacebuilding, CSS has
again renewed its relationship with the policy sphere. Some academics
and policy-makers now have a united front that rather than placing
emancipation at the heart of policy-making it should be 'local
knowledge' and 'local demands'.¶ The double irony of the birth and death
of CSS is not only that CSS has come full circle -- from its liberal
teleological universalist and emancipatory claims, in the 1990s, to its
discourses of limits and flatter ontologies, highlighting differences
and pluralities in the 2010s -- but that [[this ']{.mark}critical'
[approach to security has]{.mark} also **[mirrored]{.mark}** and
**mimicked** **[the]{.mark}** policy [discourses of]{.mark} leading
[Western powers]{.mark}. As [policy-makers]{.mark} now [look for excuses
to explain]{.mark} the [failures]{.mark}]{.underline} of the promise of
liberal interventionism, critical security [[theorists are on hand to
**salve** ]{.mark}**Western [consciences]{.mark}** [with analyses of
]{.mark}]{.underline}non-linearity, complexity and human and non-human
**[[assemblages]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It appears that the world cannot
be transformed after all. [[We cannot end]{.mark} conflict or
[insecurity, **merely attempt to manage them**.
]{.mark}]{.underline}Once critique becomes anti-critique (Noys 2011) and
emancipatory alternatives are seen to be merely expressions of liberal
hubris, [[the appendage of 'critical' for arguments that discount the
possibility of transforming the world]{.mark} and stake no claims which
[are unamenable to power]{.mark}]{.underline} or distinct from dominant
philosophical understandings is highly problematic. Let us study
security, its discourses and its practices, by all means but please let
us not pretend that study is somehow the same as critique.

### Communication Good---1NC

#### Communicative rationality and intersubjectivity founded on minimal guidelines create intellectual experimentation around the resolution in a form of play that helps combat ideological attachments\-\--this is a better way to dissolve metaphysical understandings of the subject than the aff's abandonment of reason 

**Merawi 11**, Fasil Addis Ababa University, Faculty Of Humanities,
Department Of Philosophy (Graduate Programme), Habermas And The
Discourse Of Modernity,
etd.aau.edu.et/dspace/bitstream/123456789/3695/1/FASIL%20MERAWI.pdf

Heidegger and Derrida should have avoided appealing to
ontico-ontological significance of a being that can give an insight to
Being itself as such, and a heterogeneous state determining all meaning.
Instead they should have resorted to the communicative paradigm. As we
have seen in Heidegger, Dasein has a unique place as a being that
interrogates Being as such, and thus was taken as a point of departure.
Habermas urges the interlocutors in the philosophical discourse of
modernity to abandon the subject-object metaphysics, where the subject
is oriented towards an objective possible state of affairs, and instead
tries to strengthen the communicative action taking place between
individuals in modern societies. Hence, he remarks, "I have already
suggested that the paradigm of the knowledge of objects has to be
replaced by the paradigm of mutual understanding between subjects
capable of speech and action." (PDM, 295-296) Habermas sees in
Heidegger, Derrida and Foucault a rejection of the subject that
establishes its primacy by its reflection on the world. But, whereas
Heidegger and [[Derrida]{.underline}]{.mark} tried to make some
compromise, by [establish]{.underline}ing the Dasein Analytic, and
[[show how]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the subject participates in a
Heterogeneous deferred meaning formation]{.underline}]{.mark} ;Foucault
on the contrary tried to completely denounce the subject in placing it
under concrete, material, and specific power/knowledge relationships.
From Habermas's point of view, the divisions between empirical and
transcendental, Being and beings, noumenal and phenomenal, all point to
the fact that, the reason of the modern project is 'exhausted'. All
these distinctions are attempts to preserve the philosophy of the
subject under different formulations. Some situated the subject as locus
of possible cognition. Others show that the subject is completely
autonomous, while there are also some that place the subject under
different repressive relations. But all these are exhausted for Habermas
since as we have seen in the last three chapters no attempts have been
successful to come up with a strong alternative. [[The solution
is]{.mark} making the move to [communicative
rationality]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}and intersubjectivity. Hence
Habermas remarks that, "\[t\]he paradigm of the philosophy of
consciousness is exhausted. If this is so, the symptoms of exhaustion
should dissolve with the transition to the paradigm of mutual
understanding." (PDM, 296 [[The essence]{.mark} of communicative
rationality [lies in how language coordinates
actions]{.mark}]{.underline}; how actors in an intersubjective
communicative process tend to respect some rules and in the process how
understanding is to be achieved. In the communicative paradigm, [[when a
speech act is forwarded, the one]{.mark} to which its directed,
[recognizes it and]{.mark}]{.underline} thereby [[offers a]{.mark}
[reply establishing a]{.mark}n intersubjective [communicative
process]{.mark}]{.underline}. What makes this communicative process
possible are the shared backgrounds of meanings and idealizing
presuppositions that guide communicative processes, and also the fact
that those in communication are, oriented towards consensus. This
differs radically from the paradigm of consciousness where a relation is
to be established to a possible state of affairs. Habermas thinks that
[[in the communicative paradigm, the subject is no longer]{.mark} viewed
as being [divided]{.mark} between empirical and transcendental
domains.]{.underline} Accordingly, Habermas claims that in communicative
rationality, "no mediation is possible between the extramundane stance
of the transcendental I and the intermundane stance of the empirical I"
(PDM, 297). [[The ego finds itself in an intersubjective]{.mark}
communicative [arena and]{.mark} it **[affirms itself by presenting its
validity ]{.mark}**]{.underline}claims. For Habermas, a speech act as
the smallest unit of every-day communication, serves as a platform for
raising validity claims, or the claims of individuals in asserting that
what they are claiming is true and that they can provide 94 reasons for
it in relation to the objective, social and subjective worlds. Hence,
the "ego stands within an interpersonal relationship that allows him to
relate to himself as a participant in an interaction from the
perspective of alter."(ibid) [[This differs from subject-object
metaphysics]{.underline}]{.mark} where everything becomes a possible
state of affair to be known in the objective the world. Instead in
communicative rationality, [[the ego]{.mark} becomes the one which
[founds its claims in a world of other possible
claims]{.mark}]{.underline}, oriented towards the objective, social and
subjective dimensions.

### Materialism---1NC

#### The aff's reductionist view of war disconnects simulacra from their real institutional determinants\-\--only countering simulations with better military scholarship can prevent endless intervention 

Mitchell **Hobbs 6**, The University of Newcastle, Australia,
REFLECTIONS ON THE REALI TY OFTHE IRAQ WARS: THE DEMISE OFBAUDRILLARD'S
SEARCH FORTRUTH?,
https://www.academia.edu/2569231/Reflections_on_the_reality_of_the_Iraq_Wars_the_demise_of_Baudrillards_search_for_truth

Although Baudrillard's work on "simulation" and "simulacra" is valuable
in highlightingthe relationship between the mass media and reality, and,
in particular, the ways in which media content (images and narratives)
come to be de-contextualised, his theses are per se insufficient for the
analysis of the contemporary mass media. For instance, asmedia theorist
and researcher Douglas Kellner (2003:31) notes, beyond the level of
media spectacle, [[Baudrillard does not help readers understand]{.mark}
events such as [the Gulf War, because he **reduces**]{.mark} **the
[actions]{.mark} of actors** [and **complex political issues**
to]{.mark} categories of "[simulation]{.mark}"]{.underline} and
"hyper-reality", in a sense "erasing their concrete determinants".
Kellner, who like Baudrillard, has written extensively on media
spectacles, including theGulf Wars, sees Baudrillard's theory as being
"one-dimensional", "privilege\[ing\] the form of media technology over
its content, meaning and...use" (Kellner, 1989:73). In thisregard,
[[Baudrillard]{.mark} [does not account for the political economic
dimensions ]{.mark}]{.underline}of the newsmedia, nor the cultural
practices involved with the production of news (Kellner, 1989:73-74).
Thus, [[he suffers from]{.underline}]{.mark} the same [technologically
deterministic [essentialism]{.mark}]{.underline} thatundermined the
media theories of Marshall McLuhan, albeit in a different form
(Kellner,1989:73-74). Although Kellner (2003:32) believes that
Baudrillard's pre-1990s works on "the consumer society, on the political
economy of the sign, simulation and simulacra,and the implosion of
\[social\] phenomenon" are useful and can be deployed within
criticalsocial theory, he prefers to read Baudrillard's later, more
controversial and obscure, workas "science fiction which anticipates the
future by exaggerating present tendencies" In order [**[to understand
war]{.mark}**]{.underline} and its relationship with the media in the
contemporary era [[it is,]{.underline}]{.mark} then, [[necessary to move
beyond Baudrillard]{.underline}]{.mark}'s spectacular theory of media
spectacle. For although our culture is resplendent with images, signs
and narratives, circulating in aseemingly endless dance of mimicry (or,
rather, simulacra), [[there are **observable social
institutions**]{.underline} ]{.mark}and practices producing this
semiotic interplay. Although all that is solidmight melt into air (Marx
and Engles, 2002:223), appearances and illusions are not an end for
sociological analysis, but are rather a seductive invitation to further
social inquiry. As the research of Douglas Kellner (1992; 1995; 2005)
has shown, [[when]{.mark} media [spectacles are **dissected by
critical**]{.mark}]{.underline} cultural
**[[analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}**, re-contextualisation is possible.
Images and narratives can be traced back to their sources: whether they
lie in Hollywood fantasies or government 'spin'. In short, by assessing
the veracity of competing texts, war (as understood by media audiences)
can be re-connected to its antecedents and consequences. Indeed,
[[through wrestling with]{.mark} the [ideological spectres]{.mark} of
myth and narrative, [and]{.mark} by [searching]{.mark} widely [for
critically informed explanations]{.mark}]{.underline} of different
events, the social sciences can acquire an understanding [[of
the]{.mark} ['truthfulness' of]{.mark} media
[representations]{.mark}]{.underline}; of the 'authentic' in a realm
bewildered by smoke and mirrors. As long as there are competing media
voices on which to construct a juxtaposition of 'truths', sociologists
can, to a certain extent, force the media to grapple with their own
disparate reflections. 3 CONCLUSIONS 3.1 REST IN PEACE BAUDRILLARD? In
the final analysis, then, Baudrillard's work on the Gulf War and the
September 11terrorist attacks should (respectfully) be laid to rest. For
although some, such as RichardKeeble (2004:43), have followed
Baudrillard in arguing that "there was no war in the gulf in 2003", such
statements are somewhat antithetical to the truth aims of the social
sciences. Baudrillard, being both an icon and iconoclast, pushed his
language and arguments to rhetorical extremes in order to force the
collapse of representations andarguments he saw as having supplanted
truth. His fatal theory was in a sense intellectual 'hype', for a
capricious world in which only 'hype' can be noticed. Yet in shouting
his arguments he served to obfuscate their nuance and subtext, the very
intellectualessences of his work and, ultimately, his contribution to
the body of knowledge. However, although fatal theory is of little
practical use for media researchers seeking anempirically derived
'truth', Baudrillard's oeuvre is still (somewhat) instructive,
remindingus of the importance of de-mystifying reality. For although the
voice of the scholar is that of a pariah in the entertainment driven
public sphere, we must force our voices into the public sphere if we are
to re-contextualise events such as the Iraq war, by providing audiences
with better, more veracious accounts of events[[.]{.underline}
**[Failing this, we will continue to find our 'defence' forces engaged
in military operations under spurious]{.underline}**]{.mark} casus belli
**[[arguments]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Accordingly, despite the many
faults of his work, Baudrillard should not beforgotten. For although his
contribution was more of a slap-of-the-face than a gentlepush in the
right direction, his ideas regarding simulacra and reality have helped
to further our understanding of media spectacles (and their potential
repercussions). In apost-Baudrillard world, as social inquiry (it is to
be hoped) returns to a more empiricallyinformed understanding of the
media, we should not forget the implications posed by thiscultural
field. For if sociology seeks to explain the social world, then it must
work to prevent the dislocation of reality from the 'real' that
Baudrillard so feared.

### Policy Focus---1NC

**Hobbs 07** -- (Mitchell, Lecturer and PhD Candidate (Sociology and

TRUTH?," Fall, 2007,
<http://www.tasa.org.au/conferences/conferencepapers07/papers/379.pdf>)

As has been noted by Barry Smart (2000) (and others), Baudrillard's
theorising, which has its roots in neo-Marxism, eventually led him to
the proposition that if current sociological critique was incapable of
ascertaining truth because reality was being superseded by
de-contextualised images (or, rather, signs), then a new system of
social inquiry was needed, one capable of breaking out of the endless
cycle of simulacra and the intellectual "inertia" brought about by the
meta-physical dead end of capitalism. To this end, **[Baudrillard sought
to employ [a "fatal strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**" or "fatal theory",
**[where he could highlight the deceptions of "hyper-reality" by
[pushing]{.mark} them into a "more real than real
situation",]{.underline}** to force them into a clear "over-existence
which is incompatible with that of the real" (Baudrillard cited in
Smart, 2000:464). Accordingly, by claiming that the Gulf War did not
take place, **[Baudrillard was seeking to push our thinking of this
event [beyond the orthodox political economic approach]{.mark}, in order
to draw attention to the "simulated" nature of the news media and to the
antithetical consequences of this seemingly endless use and reproduction
of images and simplistic narratives deprived of socio-historic
contexts.¶]{.underline}** 2.2 BRIDGING THE REALITY GULF: FROM
BAUDRILLARD TO KELLNER¶ Although Baudrillard's work on "simulation" and
"simulacra" is valuable in highlighting the relationship between the
mass media and reality, and, in particular, the ways in which media
content (images and narratives) come to be de-contextualised, [[his

written extensively on media spectacles, including the Gulf Wars, sees
Baudrillard's theory as being "one-dimensional", "**[privilege\[ing\]

deterministic essentialism that undermined the media theories of
Marshall McLuhan, albeit in a different form (Kellner, 1989:73-74).

**Mellor 13**, Ewan E. Ph.D. candidate, Political and Social Sciences,
European University Institute, 2013, "Why policy relevance is a moral
necessity: Just war theory, impact, and UAVs,"

[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} section of the [paper
[considers]{.mark}]{.underline} more generally [[the need for]{.mark}
just war [theorists to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[engage]{.mark} with
[policy debate]{.mark}]{.underline} [[about]{.mark} the use of
[force]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as to engage with the more
fundamental moral and philosophical principles of the just war
tradition. It draws on John Kelsay's conception of just war thinking as
being a social practice,35 as well as on Michael Walzer's understanding
of the role of the social critic in society.36 It argues that the just
war tradition is a form of "practical discourse" which is concerned with
questions of "how we should act."37 Kelsay argues that: \[T\]he criteria
of jus ad bellum and jus in bello provide a framework for structured
participation in a public conversation about the use of military force .
. . citizens who choose to speak in just war terms express commitments .
. . \[i\]n the process of giving and asking for reasons for going to
war, those who argue in just war terms seek to influence policy by
persuading others that their analysis provides a way to express and
fulfil the desire that military actions be both wise and just.38 He also
argues that "[[good]{.mark} just war [thinking

[deliberation]{.mark}]{.underline}, in the sense that one attends to all
the standard criteria at war's inception, at its end, and throughout the
course of the conflict."39 [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} is important as
it [[highlights the need]{.mark} for]{.underline} just [war scholars
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[engage with]{.mark} the [ongoing operations
]{.mark}]{.underline}in war and the specific policies that are involved.
The question of whether a particular war is just or unjust, and the
question of whether a particular weapon (like drones) can be used in
accordance with the jus in bello criteria, only cover a part of the
overall justice of the war. [[Without]{.mark} an [engagement]{.mark}
with the reality of war]{.underline}, [in terms of the [policies used in
waging it]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [it is impossible to engage with the
"moral reality of war]{.underline}]{.mark},"40 in terms of being able to
discuss it and judge it in moral terms. Kelsay's description of just war
thinking as a social practice is similar to Walzer's more general
description of social criticism. The just war theorist, as a social
critic, must be involved with his or her own society and its practices.
In the same way that the social critic's distance from his or her
society is measured in inches and not miles,41 the just war theorist
must be close to and must understand the language through which war is
constituted, interpreted and reinterpreted.42 It is only by
understanding the values and language that their own society purports to
live by that the social critic can hold up a mirror to that society to
demonstrate its hypocrisy and to show the gap that exists between its
practice and its values.43 The tradition itself provides a set of values
and principles and, as argued by Cian O'Driscoll, constitutes [[a
"language of engagement" to spur participation]{.mark}]{.underline} in
public and political debate.44 This language is part of "our common
heritage, the product of many centuries of arguing about war."45 These
principles and this language [[provide the terms through which
people]{.mark} understand and come to [interpret
war]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} not in a deterministic way but
[[by]{.underline} [providing]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[categories]{.mark} necessary [for]{.mark} moral understanding and
[moral argument ]{.mark}]{.underline}about the legitimate and
illegitimate uses of force.46 By spurring and providing the basis for
[[political engagement]{.underline}]{.mark} the just war tradition
ensures that the acts that occur within war are considered according to
just war criteria and [[allows policy-makers to be held to
account]{.underline}]{.mark} on this basis. Engaging with the reality of
war requires recognising that war is, as Clausewitz stated, a
continuation of policy. War, according to Clausewitz, is subordinate to
politics and to political choices and these political choices can, and
must, be judged and critiqued.47 Engagement and political debate are
morally necessary as the alternative is disengagement and moral
quietude, which is a sacrifice of the obligations of citizenship.48
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} engagement must bring just war theorists
into contact with the policy makers and [[will]{.underline} [require
work that is]{.underline}]{.mark} [accessible and [relevant to policy
makers]{.mark}]{.underline}, [however]{.underline} [[this does not mean
a sacrifice of critical distance]{.underline}]{.mark} [or an abdication
of truth in the face of power]{.underline}. [[By]{.underline} [engaging
in detail with]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [policies]{.mark} being
pursued]{.underline} and their concordance or otherwise with the
principles of the just war tradition the [[policy-makers will be forced
to account for]{.mark} their [decisions]{.mark}]{.underline} and justify
them in just war language. In contrast to the view, suggested by Kenneth
Anderson, that "the public cannot be made part of the debate" and that
"\[w\]e are necessarily committed into the hands of our political
leadership",49 it is incumbent upon just war theorists to ensure that
the public are informed and are capable of holding their political
leaders to account. To accept the idea that the political leadership are
stewards and that accountability will not benefit the public, on whose
behalf action is undertaken, but will only benefit al Qaeda,50 is a
grotesque act of intellectual irresponsibility. As Walzer has argued, it
is precisely because it is "our country" that we are "especially
obligated to criticise its policies."51 Conclusion This paper has
discussed the empirics of the policies of drone strikes in the ongoing
conflict with those associate with al Qaeda. It has demonstrated that
there are significant moral questions raised by the just war tradition
regarding some aspects of these policies and it has argued that, thus
far, just war scholars have not paid sufficient attention or engaged in
sufficient detail with the policy implications of drone use. As such it
has been argued that it is necessary for just war theorists to engage
more directly with these issues and to ensure that their work is policy
relevant, not in a utilitarian sense of abdicating from speaking the
truth in the face of power, but by forcing policy makers to justify
their actions according to the principles of the just war tradition,
principles which they invoke themselves in formulating policy. By
highlighting hypocrisy and providing the tools and language for the
interpretation of action, the just war tradition provides the basis for
the public engagement and political activism that are necessary for
democratic politics.52

### Practicality---1NC

#### **The affirmative over-states the role played by illusion in politics\-\--their emphasis on unmasking reality leaves us unable to deal with practical political problems**

15¶ they have much more often been put forward by different thinkers and
different schools of thought. However, even when living separate lives,
the two bodies of belief have regularly coexisted in a broad range of
civilizations and historical periods. Everything happens as if, despite
their seeming distance and even contradiction to each other, they were
in fact allied. What is the meaning of this working partnership between
partners with such widely differing motives, ambitions, and tenets?¶
[[The world may be]{.mark} strife and [illusion, but its]{.mark}
troubles, [sufferings, and dangers do not dissipate simply because they
have been **denied solidity**]{.mark} **and value**.]{.underline}
**[Once devalued, the world]{.underline}**---**[especially the social
world---must still be managed]{.underline}**. **[[We must prevent the
worst]{.mark} from happening.]{.underline}** [[Those who]{.mark} can
[apprehend the truth]{.mark} of the situation, [divining]{.mark}
[ultimate being under]{.mark} the shadows of mendacious]{.underline}
[[difference,]{.mark} and **permanence under the appearance of
change**]{.underline}, [[are a happy few.]{.mark} [Their
withdrawal]{.mark}]{.underline} from social responsibility in the name
of an ethic of contemplative serenity, inaction, and absorption into the
reality of the One **[[fails to solve the practical problems of social
order]{.mark}.]{.underline}** On the contrary, **[[such a retreat
threatens]{.mark} to leave a [disaster]{.mark} in its wake: the calamity
of [a vacuum of initiative and belief.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[Into
this]{.mark} vacuum [steps]{.mark} the doctrine of [hierarchical
specialization]{.mark}]{.underline}** in soul and society. ¶ Seen
through the sharp and selective lens of the perennial philosophy, this
doctrine may be no more than a holding operation, as inexorable in its
claims on those who must govern society as it is groundless in its
metaphysical justification. There is then no surprise in seeing it most
often represented by traditions of thought different from those that
have adhered to the perennial philosophy.¶ Some in the world history of
thought, however, have claimed to discern a more intimate connection
between the doctrine of order and the perennial philosophy. If ultimate
reality is spirit residing in all the apparent particulars, and most
especially in living beings, then identification with universal spirit
creates as well a basis for universal solidarity or compassion. The same
compassion can then reappear in a commanding place among the highest
faculties of the soul. It can therefore also be most closely identified
with rulers and priests. The bonds of reciprocity, of mutual allegiance
and devotion, among supe¶ ¶ 16¶ riors and subalterns as well as among
equals, can be founded on the expression and the worship of universal
spirit, manifest among us as compassion and solidarity.¶ It is a belief
we find articulated in philosophical and religious teachings as
different as those of Buddha and Confucius. It reappears in that
uniquely relentless Western statement of the otherwise un-Western
instance of the perennial philosophy---the teaching of Schopenhauer.
This belief turns the doctrine of social and moral order into something
more than an effort to contain calamity and savagery in this vale of
tears and illusions: into a concerted effort to soften the terror of
social life, shortening the distance between ultimate being and everyday
experience. The perennial philosophy suffers from both a cognitive and
an existential defect. The former is manifest in its vision of the
world, and the latter, in its quest for happiness through serenity, and
for serenity through invulnerability and distance.¶ Its cognitive flaw
is its failure to recognize how completely and irreparably we are in
fact embodied and situated. Not only our sufferings and our joys but
also our prospects of action and discovery are engaged in the reality
and the transformation of difference: the differences among phenomena
and among people. To understand a state of affairs, whether in nature or
in science, is to grasp what it might become as it is subject to
different directions and varieties of pressure. Our imagination of these
next steps---of these metamorphoses of reality---is the indispensable
sign of advance in insight. When we deny the reality--- at least the
ultimate reality---of differences, we sever the vital link between
insight into the real and imagined or experienced transformation. ¶ The
existential failing of the perennial philosophy is the revenge of this
denied and unchained reality against the hope that we would become freer
and happier if only we could see through the illusions of change and
distinction. [[The point of seeing through]{.mark} these [illusions
is]{.mark}]{.underline} supposed to be [[greater freedom]{.mark} on the
basis of truer understanding]{.underline}. ¶ **[However[, the
consequence of]{.mark} the required [denial of the reality of
particulars may be the inverse of]{.mark} the [liberation]{.mark} it
promises.]{.underline}** [[Having declared independence in the
mind]{.underline}]{.mark} and ceased war against the realities¶ ¶ 17¶
around us, **[we find ourselves confined within a narrowing
space.]{.underline}** [**[In the name of freedom, we become more]{.mark}
dependent and more [enslaved.¶ ]{.mark}**[We]{.mark} may cast on
ourselves a spell [temporarily to quiet our restless
striving.]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[However]{.mark}, in so doing we [deny
ourselves instruments with which to explore the]{.mark} real
[world.]{.mark}]{.underline}** We forego the means by which to see how
everything in it can become something else when placed under resistance.
By the same token, **[[we]{.mark} [lose the tools]{.mark} with which [to
strengthen our practical powers.]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}We
become cranks, slaves, and fantasists under the pretext of becoming free
men and women. It is true that there will always be moments when we can
transport ourselves, through such self-incantation, into a realm in
which the particulars of the world and of the body, to which we have
denied ultimate reality, cease to burden us. However, we cannot live in
such a world; **[[our moments of supposed liberation cannot survive
the]{.mark} routines and [responsibilities of practical
life.]{.mark}¶]{.underline}** The alliance of the perennial philosophy
with the practical doctrine of hierarchical specialization in soul and
society has been the predominant position in the world history of
speculative thought. Its major opponent has been a direction of thinking
that, though exceptional in the context of world history, has long been
the chief view in Western philosophy. The expression of this view in
philosophical texts, however, is secondary to its broader articulation
in religion, literature, and art. It is not merely the artifact of a
tradition of speculative theorizing; it is the mainstay of a
civilization, though a mainstay that represents a radical and
uncompromising deviation from what has elsewhere been the dominant
conception. Today this deviation has become the common possession of
humanity thanks to the global propagation of its ideas by both high and
popular Western culture. Its assumptions nevertheless remain inexplicit
and its relation to the representation of nature in science unclear. To
render this Western deviation from the perennial philosophy both
perspicuous and uncompromising is a major part of the work of a
radicalized pragmatism.¶ The hallmark of the deviation is belief in the
reality of time as well as in the reality of the differences around
which our experience is organized: in the first instance, the reality of
the individual person and of¶ ¶ 18¶ differences among persons; in the
second, the discrete structure of the world we perceive and inhabit. It
is the view of individual personality that is most central to this
belief system; everything else follows as a consequence.¶ The
individual, his character, and his fate are for real. Each individual is
different from every other individual who has ever lived or who will
ever live. A human life is a dramatic and irreversible movement from
birth to death, surrounded by mystery and overshadowed by chance.¶
[[What individuals can do]{.underline}]{.mark} with their lives
[[depends on the way society is organized]{.mark}]{.underline} and on
their place within the social order, as well as on achievement and luck.
What happens in biographical time turns in large part on what happens in
historical time. For this reason alone, history is a scene of decisive
action, and everything that takes place in it is, like individuality
itself, for real, not an illusory or distracting epiphenomenon obscuring
a timeless reality. History is not cyclical but rather resembles
individual life in being unilinear and irreversible. The institutions
and the beliefs we develop in historical time may expand or diminish the
life chances of the individual, including his relative power to
challenge and change them in the course of his activities.¶ The reality
of difference and of transformation, rooted in the basic facts of
individual experience, then becomes the model on which we see and
confront the whole world. Nothing is more crucial to the definition of
such an approach to the world than its way of representing the relation
between its view of humanity and its view of nature. This representation
is subject to three related misstatements that narrow the reach and
weaken the force of the alternative it offers to the perennial
philosophy. In the process of criticizing and rejecting these
alternatives, we come to see more clearly just what is at stake in the
advancement of this alternative conception. Many of the most influential
positions in the history of Western philosophy---including the "rejected
options" discussed in the previous section---represent variations on
qualified and inadequate versions of the alternative.

### Empiricism Good---1NC

#### Tracing the [quantitative implications]{.underline} of empire [isn't]{.underline} the computational logic they critique. It's [liberatory]{.underline}.

**O'Sullivan, et al, 18**---University of California, Berkeley (David,
with Luke Bergmann and Jim Thatcher, "Spatiality, Maps, and Mathematics
in Critical Human Geography: Toward a Repetition with Difference," The
Professional Geographer, 70:1, 129-139, dml)

[Quantitative methods]{.underline} in geography [are **often assumed**
to be **intrinsically tied to absolute**, **Euclidean** and **Cartesian
perspectives** on space. This relationship is **not
inevitable**]{.underline}, as is clear from even the brief examination
of work in quantitative geography we undertake here. [There have **long
been quantitative approaches** to space centered on the idea that
**proximity** and **interaction are not simply related to
distance**]{.underline} "as the crow flies," [and these can provide
**jumping-off points** for the **creative exploration of sociospatial
structures**]{.underline}. Indeed, we want to suggest [that]{.underline}
one source (among many) of contemporary human geography's rich streams
of [thought]{.underline} on the production of space, place, scale,
connectivity, relationality, territory, and so on (see, inter alia,
Smith 1984; Massey 1993; Marston, Jones, and Woodward 2005; Secor 2013)
[is]{.underline} a lesser known tradition of self-styled theoretical
geography, prominent in the 1960s and 1970s and [**experimental** in its
use of **computation** and **mathematics**]{.underline} (see Bunge
1966). This tradition has many differences in origins and commitments
from much of the social theory and continental philosophy that informs
what contemporary geographers think of as theory. [Yet **too little
work** has moved on to explore how **ontological resonances** between
such approaches can be **productive**]{.underline} for contemporary
human geography.

To encourage reconsideration of received understandings of the
quantitative and cartographic, we assemble several intriguing early
innovations that rely on geometries that move beyond the Euclidean. To
begin, in the next section we consider three examples of the kind of
work we have in mind: first, Bunge's (1988) Nuclear War Atlas; second,
Tobler's work on innovative geographical projections; and third, a range
of work through the 1970s, struggling to represent and theorize [new
concepts of geographical space]{.underline}, ably reviewed in a
then-contemporary paper by Forer (1978).

Our argument is that these (and other examples) were and remain highly
relevant to theoretical developments in geography, including social
theory (Harvey 1973; Sack 1980; Soja 1980; Smith 1984; Gregory and Urry
1985; Massey 1999; Sheppard 2008; Secor 2013), precisely because they
[**grapple** with the challenges of **understanding non-absolute**,
**non-Newtonian models** of space]{.underline} suggested by those
theoretical developments. In effect, **[mathematical]{.underline}** and
visual **[approaches]{.underline}** for extending the geographical
imagination (Harvey 1973; Gregory 1994; Massey 2005) [were being
**developed alongside** and **in conversation** with social theory that
suggested the **value of such methods for critical
perspectives**]{.underline} in geography. Yet, although the conceptual
innovations in theory have been widely taken up, researchers have rarely
brought parallel developments in computational methods into the
conversation. [It is **one thing to critique quantitative**,
**computational**, and **cartographic methods** and **quite another to
constructively engage them** to advance critical social
theory]{.underline}. Such engagement is not easy given the very
different notions of theory traded in by social theory and mathematical
science, but we agree with Schuurman (2002) that such engagement is
urgent and with Wilson (2015) that ["a **tacking back** and **forth
between technical practice** and **critical practice**"]{.underline}
(31) [is **possible** and **necessary**]{.underline}. As part of this
focus section on critical studies of data and technology, we offer paths
toward Dalton, Taylor, and Thatcher's (2016) desired "dialog between the
deeply theoretical and the robustly empiric" (1).

[**Geospatial visualization** and **analysis are more accessible than
ever**. Feminist and critical GIS have **further transformed the
epistemological stakes** of representation, visualization, and
analysis]{.underline} (McLafferty 2002; Pavlovskaya and St. Martin 2007;
Kwan 2008; we return to these contributions later). Yet it is ironic
that more-than-Euclidean, nonabsolute spatial representations remain
rare in broader scholarship and professional practice. In a double
irony, the relentless absolute model of space embedded in geographical
information systems1 and also (perhaps even more so) in newer Web-based
mapping platforms is directing renewed enthusiasm for quantitative,
cartographic approaches in critical human geography into precisely the
narrow "view from nowhere" mappings of which now-mainstream and other
radical theories remain deeply skeptical (see Haraway 1988). Through a
careful tracing of the theoretical geography of the 1960s, we suggest
how [scholars, drawing on **methodological traditions**]{.underline}
past and present, [**mathematical** and **critical**, might **move
beyond absolute spatiality** and explore manifold "**views from
somewhere**" that further critique the **power geometries**]{.underline}
(Massey 1993) [and **spatial structures** of contemporary
society]{.underline}.

Mappings of Non-Euclidean, Nonabsolute Spaces

Bunge's Nuclear War Atlas Bunge's (1988) Nuclear War Atlas is about
nuclear war, about peace and human flourishing, and about how a
geographical imagination can advance one over the other. The importance
of the book to our argument does not rest on these themes but on how it
reconstructs maps and our geographic imagination to develop arguments.
It is significant that this volume comes many years after Bunge's work
with the Detroit Geographical Expedition and Institute (DGEI) of the
1970s yet addresses many of the same themes, often using imaginative
visualizations that show that other cartographic spatialities are
possible beyond those offered today by GIS. It is particularly important
to note Bunge's approach, given the recent revival of interest in his
Fitzgerald (Bunge 1971; note its 2011 reprinting; see also Barnes et al.
2011). Fitzgerald was, as Bunge noted, the product of a much larger
effort involving, among many others, Betty Bunge and Gwendolyn Warren,
and needs to be understood as such. At the same time, reading Fitzgerald
out of the context of Bunge's larger oeuvre risks underplaying Bunge's
enduring contributions to cartographic and quantitatively engaged
theoretical geography (Bunge 1966; see also Cox, Macmillan, and Bunge
2001; Goodchild 2008).

If Fitzgerald is a "tortured book, controversial, angry, partial,
withering, hyperbolic, with non sequiturs and unsubstantiated claims"
(Heynen and Barnes, in their Foreword to the 2011 reprint of Fitzgerald
\[Bunge 1971\]), so, too, is Nuclear War Atlas. Much of Nuclear War
Atlas is repetitive, both within its own pages and in the wider context
of Bunge's oeuvre. It picks up where Fitzgerald closes with the "total
species' effort to tame the machines" (Bunge 1971, 242), no longer now
merely automobiles and the harsh urban landscape but the spectre of
global nuclear warfare. The theme of human survival is consistent with
the earlier work (see also Bunge 1973). Figures and maps from Fitzgerald
(Bunge 1971) and from Theoretical Geography (Bunge 1966) also reappear.
Mapping was central to the approach of the DGEI, which has been an
important impetus and inspiration for contemporary practitioners of
participatory GIS, community mapping, and countermapping (Wood 2010b;
Heynen 2013; Benach 2017). The innovation in the maps produced by DGEI
and later projects in Canada (Bunge and Bordessa 1975), however, lies
not principally in their cartographic construction but in their critical
content. Maps are presented of the "region of rat-bitten babies" in
Detroit (Bunge and Bordessa 1975, 326) or of "children's pedestrian
deaths and injuries by automobiles" (DGEI 1971, 12--13).2 These maps
reappear in Nuclear War Atlas (the former as Map 3.16 on page 167, the
latter as Map 2.16 on page 123). Such maps dramatically draw attention
to the injustices they document, even today, when mapping the everyday
has itself become quotidian, whether as volunteered geographic
information (Elwood, Goodchild, and Sui 2012), neogeography (Haklay,
Singleton, and Parker 2008), or the geoweb (Stephens 2013). In Nuclear
War Atlas, the cartographic drama is heightened because "The color red
is used throughout the atlas on the maps to depict death, and green
life" (Bunge 1988, ix; there is very little green ink in the book).

What is most striking about Nuclear War Atlas is how Bunge pushes the
possibilities of maps and diagrams to advance his position that
[**nuclear weapons render conventional geopolitical concepts of
territory inadequate**. In suggesting that the **advent
of**]{.underline} intercontinental ballistic missiles [(**ICBMs**)
constitutes a "**topological space collapse**"]{.underline} (Bunge 1988,
83), Bunge builds on material in Theoretical Geography (Bunge 1966) to
develop his argument that advances in transportation and logistics have
produced "The Shrinking World" (Bunge 1988). Just as the advent of sea
travel and naval power meant that "all nations would be connected to all
others" (91), [the advent of ICBMs makes their possessors
"**three-dimensional powers**"]{.underline} (92). As such, [we must
think **not of national boundaries** but of "**boundary
surfaces**"]{.underline} (84). The United States and Soviet Union became
"the closest neighbors ever" (93; this map also appeared in an earlier
form in Bunge 1966, 277). [These **spatial conceptual
arguments**]{.underline} draw heavily on novel mappings and visual
representations of the world. They [demand **considerable geographical
imagination**]{.underline} from readers as they are challenged [to
consider the **global existential threat of nuclear armageddon**. These
arguments and mappings have **much to contribute to current
debates**]{.underline} in human geography [concerning]{.underline}
volumetric space and [**verticality** and their implications
for]{.underline} notions such as **[territory]{.underline}** (see Elden
2013; Graham 2016).

Bunge was quite distant from the centers of the academic world by the
late 1980s, and his stridently partial writing was sometimes considered
insufficiently disinterested to be taken entirely seriously (see, e.g.,
Cutter 1990). It is notable that although Fitzgerald (Bunge 1971) has
seen a revival in recent years, its cartographic novelty lies in the
subject matter of its maps, not in how those maps represent space and
geography. Nuclear War Atlas is different, arguing through cartography
at multiple levels, rendering the production of space, expanding the
possibilities of mapping so that it becomes integral to the book's bleak
discussions of geopolitics. [Space is **reimagined not as Euclidean**
but]{.underline} via measures of distance such as "death miles from
London" [as a way to **understand the reach of**]{.underline} the
British **[Empire]{.underline}** (79). He suggested that [the globe must
be **reimagined** in terms of **different metrics** than the purely
Euclidean to **fully understand the complex spaces** of]{.underline}
Cold War **[nuclear geopolitics]{.underline}**. Although Bunge's
conceptual reach might exceed his cartographic and technical grasp, not
to mention the facilities available as an independent scholar producing
the Nuclear War Atlas, it is telling that the relational geopolitical
geographies across scales from the local to the global call for such
"metacartography" (Bunge 1966) and that words alone are insufficient to
convey such complex spatialities.

(Map) Transformations of Geography

The most sustained engagement with the challenges of geographic
projections and the kinds of representations that Bunge was reaching for
is found in the work of Tobler (1961, 1979, 2000). Indeed, perhaps
incongruously for contemporary readers, for whom Tobler is eponymously
associated with the first law of geography (Sui 2004) and thus often
enrolled in justifying geographical analysis in absolute space, Bunge
and other cartographers have understood Tobler's work as fundamental to
[constructing relational spaces in **mathematical**]{.underline} and
visual **[languages]{.underline}** (Bunge 1988, especially xxv, 78; see
also the dedication to Tobler in Cauvin, Escobar, and Serradj 2010).
Much of Tobler's work was anticipated in his PhD dissertation (Tobler
1961), a comprehensive rethinking of map projections as "transformations
of geographic space." Tobler's framework [enables the creation of
**cartograms**]{.underline} (Tobler 1963) [where Euclidean space **gives
way** to spaces **defined by the phenomena that inhabit
them**]{.underline}. Many have since advanced [these]{.underline} and
related visual [approaches]{.underline} to space that [**move beyond
enlightenment cartographic concerns** of absolute spatial
accuracy]{.underline} (e.g., Dorling 1991).

Tobler acknowledged the influence of Thompson's (1917) On Growth and
Form on his own theory of transformations (Tobler 1961). Indeed, as
Werritty (2010) retells geography's quantitative revolution, Thompson's
morphogenetics was quite central in its development. Morphogenetics's
dialectical linking of process and form deemphasizes Euclidean measures
of distance in favor of relational measures tied to the processes
driving changes in form. Applied geographically, [this perspective
**opens up** the prosaic world of map projections into a set of
interpretative practices both **fluid** and **exploratory**. Alternative
metrics]{.underline} for distance or area [can be **reconstructed from
data** to create **unconventional maps of variable scale**, which may
then be used to **explore what sorts of processes might have produced
such spaces**]{.underline} (Tobler 2000).

of Washington (Sarah and Katharyne, "Another Politics Is Possible:

[**New forms** and **applications** of]{.underline} Internet-based
[spatial media **continue to rise** in number and diversity, with these
technologies **increasingly present** in various forms of]{.underline}
civic engagement and [activism]{.underline}. Multimedia [**data
collection**, **compilation**, and **mapping**]{.underline} toolkits
such as those provided by Ushahidi [are being **deployed for citizen
monitoring of ethnic violence**, **election fraud**, and **disaster
relief needs** and **resources**]{.underline} (Okolloh 2009; Goodchild
and Glennon 2010; Roche, Propeck-Zimmermann, and Mericskay 2011). [A
**growing number** of urban governments now use **online** and **mobile
geo-services** that allow residents to **submit their observations of
infrastructural problems** and **other local needs**]{.underline} via a
geo-tagged text message or photograph or by adding an object to a map
interface (Foth and others 2009; Elwood and Leszczynski 2013; Johnson
and Sieber 2012). [Citizens have used]{.underline} the
**[high-resolution imagery]{.underline}** of virtual globes like Google
Earth [to **monitor military buildup** or **reveal supposedly secret
sites** and **facilities**]{.underline} (Aday and Livingston 2009;
Perkins and Dodge 2009). These examples extend a vibrant history of
civic applications of the earliest interactive mapping tools, including
map mashups of Chicago crime data or post-hurricane evacuation and
relief needs in New Orleans (Miller 2006; Crutcher and Zook 2009).

The technologies and practices that underlie these applications of
Internet-based spatial media have become known by a dizzying array of
new terms in the past several years. Volunteered geographic information
(VGI) refers to spatial data sets compiled from the contributions of
many individuals, such as citizen reports to a disaster relief map
interface (Goodchild 2007; Elwood, Goodchild, and Sui 2012). The
geospatial Web originally referenced only the centrality of geographic
location as a means of organizing and retrieving online content (Scharl
and Tochtermann 2007). The term ''geoweb'' is now used more broadly to
identify this location-mediated Internet content and the hardware and
software that enable its production, such as GPS-enabled handheld
devices or freely available mapping APIs (Elwood and Leszczynski 2013).
[''**Neogeography**'' has been used to refer to]{.underline} what some
users do with interactive online mapping tools -- namely to [the
**production of maps** and other **visual spatial artefacts** through
various geoweb resources, often by **laypersons**, **activists**,
**artists**, **grassroots groups**, and other ''**non-expert**''
actors]{.underline} (Eisnor 2006; Turner 2007; Wilson and Graham 2013).

Geographers' [interest in these phenomena is **wide-ranging**, including
**core**]{.underline} GIScience **[questions about
ontologies]{.underline}**, data quality, [and **data
integration**]{.underline} (De Longueville and others 2010; Grira,
Bedard, and Roche 2010; Haklay 2010); disciplinary concerns about the
future of cartography and related arenas (Gartner 2009; Kraak 2011;
Goodchild and Turner 2013; Kitchin and Dodge 2013); [and questions about
their **social** and **political implications**]{.underline} (Crampton
2009; Dodge and Perkins 2009; Elwood 2010). In the latter arena -- the
social and political implications of neogeography -- we see divergent
concerns and predictions. Some scholars trace trends of increasing
surveillance and state/ private-sector control over the production and
circulation of geospatial imagery, maps, and the resources needed to
produce and share them (Perkins and Dodge 2009; Gerlach 2010;
Leszczynski 2012). Others suggest that [neogeography constitutes **new
spaces of civic engagement** or **resistance** and begins to **level
access to**]{.underline} cartography, [**geovisual imagery**, and
**deliberative** or **decision-making forums** in which they are
used]{.underline} (Madden and Ross 2009; Okolloh 2009; Meier 2011). In
particular, as scholars have debated this empowerment/marginalization
dialectic (Sheppard 2005), there has been a great deal of interest in
whether and how [neogeography might **enable the participation**,
**influence**, and **agency of less powerful actors**]{.underline}. The
existing literature offers two kinds of propositions for how they might
do so -- [by **offering less powerful actors greater access** to
conventional spheres/practices of deliberative decision making and
cartography]{.underline} (see Tulloch 2008; Hall and others 2010; Gryl
and Jekel 2012), [or by enabling them to **create their own alternative
spheres** of deliberation/engagement and cartographic
praxis]{.underline} (cf. Kingsbury and Jones 2009; Okolloh 2009; Lin
2013).

[These]{.underline} different propositions [are]{.underline}, at heart,
[arguments about the **forms of politics** that are or might be
constituted through the practices associated with
neogeography]{.underline}, and it is this concern that will take centre
stage in our discussion here. [By ''politics'' we are **not** referring
to the specific realm of electoral politics but rather to a **much
broader range** of individual and collective practices which **act on**
or **engage structurally mediated inequalities**, the **social** and
**material relations** of everyday life, and **negotiations over
identity**]{.underline} (Kofman and Peake 1990; Brown and Staeheli
2003). This wider definition of politics is critical for theorizing
[neogeography]{.underline}, given that it [has **from inception** tended
to be **pluralist**, **processual**, and **rooted in everyday
life**]{.underline}. For all the discussion of participation,
empowerment, democratization, or even liberation with respect to
neogeography praxis, there has been comparatively little direct
theorization of [the **forms of politics** that are or might be advanced
via neogeography]{.underline}, save for two recent papers that [draw
on]{.underline} Michel [de Certeau's]{.underline} (1984) [notions
of]{.underline} ''strategy'' and [''**tactics**'']{.underline} (Gryl and
Jekel 2012; Lin 2013).

For de Certeau, ''strategy'' is constituted through the spaces and
practices of hegemonic actors/institutions and forms of knowledge.
Voting, presenting a map and oral testimony at a public hearing, staying
out of an area framed in local discourses as a ''bad'' neighbourhood, or
analysing local needs through community development's ubiquitous
strength, weaknesses, opportunities, threats (SWOT) technique are all
examples of strategy. In contrast, **[tactics rework]{.underline}** (or
at least refuse to cooperate with and reproduce) [the **norms**,
**representational practices**, and **spatial meanings** of strategy.
Going]{.underline} walking [in a neighbourhood]{.underline} commonly
[said to be dangerous **challenges this spatial imaginary of danger**
through the action of **occupying the space**, and it **transgresses a
tacit prohibition** against going there]{.underline}. ''Walking'' this
neighbourhood in the virtual space of a neogeography platform such as
Google Maps is a visual spatial tactic (Lin 2013) that transgresses the
same prohibitions in a digital environment. Of course, these two
examples of spatial tactics are not identical experiences, given that
one occurs in a material space and the other in a virtual space. But the
broader point to be taken from Lin's notion of visual spatial tactics is
that such digital practices can constitute a transgression or reworking
of the spatial norms and restrictions of strategy.

As we will develop further in the next section, much of the existing
literature on the societal significance of neogeography is already
tacitly structured around this concept pair. Some work focuses upon the
potential of neogeography as a practice of strategy (or a politics
''from within''), and others emphasize neogeography as an arena for
tactics (the means and practice of a ''politics from outside'' by
disempowered and excluded actors). Yet on both sides, this work has to
date focused primarily on neogeography as a practice or site of
political action or engagement. We will argue here that
[neogeography]{.underline} practices -- specifically visual spatial
[tactics]{.underline} -- [are **significant** not only because they
**constitute a space for political action** or **engagement by less
powerful actors**, but also because they can function as **key sites of
political formation**]{.underline}. In what follows we show how
[the]{.underline} visual spatial [**tactics of neogeography** can foster
the **formation of political subjects**, the **formation of collective
action frames** (which may spur these political subjects to action), and
**collaborative formation of shared knowledge**]{.underline}. Thus,
visual spatial tactics in neogeography are significant not just as
practices of alternative political engagement or action by actors ''from
below'' but even more so as practices constituting critical antecedents
to such action. [Tactical neogeography practices constitute subjects as
**critical thinkers**, **mobilized actors**, and **active agents** in
collaborative knowledge-making]{.underline}.

As we will develop further in the next section, much of the existing
literature on the societal significance of neogeography is already
tacitly structured around this concept pair. Some work focuses upon the
potential of neogeography as a practice of strategy (or a politics "from
within"), and others emphasize neogeography as an arena for tactics (the
means and practice of a "politics from outside" by disempowered and
excluded actors). Yet on both sides, this work has to date focused
primarily on neogeography as a practice or site of political action or
engagement. We will argue here that neogeography practices --
specifically visual spatial tactics -- are significant not only because
they constitute a space for political action or engagement by less
powerful actors, but also because they can function as key sites of
political formation. In what follows we show how the visual spatial
tactics of neogeography can foster the formation of political subjects,
the formation of collective action frames (which may spur these
political subjects to action), and collaborative formation of shared
knowledge. Thus, visual spatial tactics in neogeography are significant
not just as practices of alternative political engagement or action by
actors "from below" but even more so as practices constituting critical
antecedents to such action. Tactical neogeography practices constitute
subjects as critical thinkers, mobilized actors, and active agents in
collaborative knowledge-making.

We develop these arguments from research conducted with young teens ages
10--13 at two Seattle schools from 2009 to 2012. School A is a public
middle school enrolling approximately 500 students, 95% of whom are
racial or ethnic minorities and 75% of whom come from low-income
families. It is located in one of Seattle's areas of highest poverty,
with comparatively high rates of unemployment, foreclosure, crime, and
violence. School B is a private middle school of 100 students, 35% of
them racial or ethnic minorities and 40% of whom receive financial aid
for their tuition. Its surrounding neighbourhood grapples with many of
the same concerns facing School A's neighbourhood, but arguably to a
somewhat lesser degree.

Our action research with these two schools examined the potential roles
of interactive mapping platforms in fostering civic engagement,
collaboration, and place-based teaching and learning. In each of the
three years, we conducted a 7- to 15-session module of interactive
mapping activities, designed to complement the school's or teacher's
existing efforts to have students learn from and about their city. In
year 1, in a class we offered as part of the educational after-school
program at School A, sixth and seventh graders created interactive maps
of their "everyday geographies." In creating and sharing their maps,
they represented and reflected upon the opportunities, constraints, and
patterns in the places and movements of their own daily lives and those
of their classmates. In year 2, as part of our activities with a seventh
grade social studies class at School B, students created interactive
multimedia maps exploring key sites and spatial processes in the urban
histories of racial and ethnic minority groups in Seattle. In year 3, we
conducted our mapping activities in the "environmental stewardship"
curriculum of a fifth grade science class at School B. Students
researched and mapped the environmental and cultural histories of two
river systems in the Puget Sound area.

In each of these three mapping units, participating students created
their interactive maps in an open-source mapping platform developed for
this project. Offering a simpler set of tools than many existing
commercial mapping web-sites, our platform enables students to create a
map object (point, line, or polygon), position this object on a base
map, give the object a name or title, and add text, images, URLs, or
video in a textbox. When a map object is selected, this associated
content appears in the window to the right of the map view (Figure 1).
Another key feature of our platform is an interactive commenting
function that allows users to select a map object and add (or respond
to) comments, questions, or additional information. These comment
streams appear beneath the map view and are accessed by clicking the map
object (see Figure 1). The students primarily created their maps in this
platform, but many of them knew about and used Google Maps in parallel,
to access some of its additional services.2 Specifically, they used its
search engine to find particular addresses or place names and its street
view service to explore photographic street-level panoramas of specific
areas.

While our three mapping units were quite different in substantive theme,
we structured all three around a similar cycle of individual and
collaborative mapping, exploration of content, and critical reflection.
Using Kolb's (1984) "experiential learning" cycle, this process moved
from observing, sharing, or learning about concrete activities, events,
or places in the "real world" to understanding the more abstract
processes that generate them. As students mapped sites or spatial
processes they deemed important (to the theme of each of the three
units), our goal was for them to learn about and critically reflect upon
the social, political, and economic processes and relationships \[End
Page 277\] that produce these geographies. Unsurprisingly, they also
gained cartographic skills and experience with digital spatial
technologies, but this was not our primary pedagogical objective.
Further, while this research has generated contributions to scholarship
in geography education and youth geographies (Elwood and Mitchell 2012;
Mitchell and Elwood 2012a, 2012b, 2012c, 2013), our purpose here is to
use evidence from this project to illustrate a more theoretical
contribution to ongoing efforts to articulate the forms of politics that
are or might be advanced in neogeography practice. With their emphases
on examining and engaging social and spatial processes and
relationships, especially vis-à-vis the past histories and present
conditions of places in which they live, the youth neogeographies
generated as part of our project are a rich source of evidence through
which to consider these questions.

The pedagogic practices described above generated the empirical basis of
our research on neogeography, children's politics, and citizenship
education. Our research design follows Burawoy's (1998) extended case
method, an inductive approach for generating theory from qualitative
ethnographic research (as opposed to deductive research designs
structured around testing hypotheses). In this approach, a case is
selected on the basis of its ability to illuminate the conceptual
questions of the research -- for us, questions about the forms of
politics that are possible for neogeographers who operate from positions
of disempowerment and exclusion. Our questions about the political
potential and significance of neogeography for less powerful actors
further demand an inductive analysis of evidence that can illuminate
processes, meanings, and social relations. To this end, our evidence
included the students' multimedia maps; map comments from teachers,
parents, and peers; and field notes produced by all members of our
research team after each class session. Our inductive analysis involved
iterative interpretive review of the data to generate and refine
propositions about the nature and forms of politics advanced through the
children's neogeographies. We validated our emerging findings through
triangulation across multiple sources of evidence, aimed at identifying
tensions, contradictions, and commonalities in the data. The specific
examples presented below are illustrative demonstrations of the forms of
politics practised by our young neogeographers but are not the only
instances in which these practices occurred in the project.

Neogeography and the political

Recent scholarly work on neogeography has moved in several different
directions. Some scholars have begun to trace the conditions of its
emergence, particularly the hardware and software developments enabling
it (Goodchild 2007; Haklay, Singleton, and Parker 2008). Others examine
the shifting political-economic relationships around the production of
spatial data and maps signalled by neogeography, with particular
interest in the changing roles and relations of state and private-sector
actors in this enterprise (Goodchild 2007; Harvey 2007; Radcliffe 2009;
Boulton \[End Page 278\] 2010; Kinsley 2010; Leszczynski 2012). Others
have focused on the substantive content produced through neogeography
practices, with particular interest in how people, places, or phenomena
are represented (or not) and implications of these presences and
absences for the (re)production of social difference, inequality, and
the digital divide (Zook and Graham 2007; Crutcher and Zook 2009; Graham
2010; Graham 2011; Graham and Zook 2011).

Another key debate has been the implications of neogeography for
cartography, GIScience, and geography. Some have characterized the roles
of academic and professional cartographers and geographers as
diminished, whereas others argue they are transformed but still
essential (Gartner 2009; Goodchild 2009; Goodchild and Turner 2013). Map
quality and public cartographic and spatial literacies have also sparked
concern. For instance, the head of the British Cartographic Society
recently worried that neogeographers (or "lay cartographers") will
diminish the quality of maps (Crampton 2010), a concern mirrored in
criticisms of neogeographers' cartographic design (Das and Kraak 2011;
Kraak 2011). Perhaps prompted by these concerns, a number of recent
interventions offer pedagogies aimed at using neogeography platforms to
foster spatial literacy, principles of cartography and GIS (Patterson
2007; Allan 2008; Campbell 2008; DeMers and Vincent 2008; Papadimitriou
2010), and active citizenship and civic participation (Milson and Earle
2008; Harris, Rouse, and Bergeron 2010; Gryl and Jekel 2012).

Finally, this ever-growing literature has examined the social and
political significance of neogeography by considering the purposes for
which individuals and social groups engage these platforms. Some have
considered the potential and limits of neogeography for public
involvement in local government planning and decision-making (Rouse,
Bergeron, and Harris 2007; Tulloch 2008; Johnson and Sieber 2012; Sieber
2012) or for citizen participation in activities such as redistricting
(Crampton 2013). Several studies consider the rising use of neogeography
interfaces to elicit and circulate citizens' observations of
on-the-ground needs and conditions in natural disasters and other
crises, with particular emphasis on the extent to which these
applications may enhance the effectiveness of government and NGO relief
efforts (Liu and Palen 2010; De Longueville and others 2010; Zook and
others 2010). Some studies examine the ways that activist groups, NGOs,
and other citizen groups use neogeography to connect with diasporic
communities, disseminate counter-narratives, or mobilize diverse forms
of action by members or potential advocates (Corbett 2012; Elwood and
Leszczynski 2013; Lin 2012, 2013). Many of these counter-hegemonic
neogeographies have included forms of recreation or art, ranging from
"spot the black helicopter" games that "surveil back" on the state to
digital map art that troubles traditional cartographic rationalities
(kanarinka 2006; Cobarrubias and Pickles 2009; Crampton 2009; Kingsbury
and Jones 2009; Lauriault and Wood 2009; Perkins and Dodge 2009).

Threading throughout this work on neogeography applications is a strong
interest in their potential to foster inclusion, agency, and
empowerment, especially for disempowered/excluded social groups or the
context of deeply asymmetrical state-society relationships. Yet they
tend to seek these outcomes in two very different arenas. Some focus on
how neogeography has been or might be used in conventional spheres of
deliberative politics, such as participatory governance schemes or the
negotiations of NGOs/citizen organizations with state actors and
institutions (Elwood and Leszczynski 2013). Others examine how
neogeography may constitute an alternative site for citizens'
articulations, deliberations, and cartographies (Kingsbury and Jones
2009; Lin 2012, 2013) -- a way for citizens to advance
counter-narratives, cartographic representations, or forms of
(political) speech unlikely to be recognized or included in conventional
deliberative spheres. These two approaches are implicitly differentiated
by where and how they situate the realm of the political neogeography
practice, and they do so in ways that draw on de Certeau's (1984)
notions of "strategy" and "tactics." One emphasizes a "politics from
within" -- neogeography as a means to gain access to existing structures
of deliberative democracy -- whereas the other emphasizes a "politics
from outside," neogeography as an alternative realm for citizen voice.

As an example of neogeography politics conceived as strategy, Gryl and
Jekel (2012) argue that collaborative online "geo-media" (which has been
termed neogeography in this article) can be sites for the development
and practice of critical spatial citizenship. They argue that this
critical spatial citizenship depends upon citizens' abilities to engage
in "strategic practices" (de Certeau 1984), such as having the
cartographic and spatial thinking skills necessary to use geo-media in
ways that will be recognized by policymakers or other citizens and to
use these platforms to disseminate their own spatial narratives or
challenge those put forth by others. A more inclusive public sphere will
emerge, Gryl and Jekel argue, when citizens are able to use interactive
geo-media to engage in the representational and deliberative practices
of "strategy."

Yet conceiving of the political potential of neogeography through
notions of strategic practice has inherent limits. Critical cartography
and GIS scholarship have long underscored that access to the bounded
disciplinary practices of cartographic "strategy" is by definition
partial and that many forms of spatial knowledge cannot be represented
as "geographic information" nor expressed through conventional
cartographic representation (Pickles 1995, 2004; Crampton and Krygier
2005). Feminist critiques remind us that structural inequalities and
even definitions of "the political" exclude some social groups from the
realms and practices of deliberative politics (Fraser 1990; Howell \[End
Page 279\] 1993). Indeed, de Certeau's effort to recognize the actors,
practices of politics, and forms of knowledge that remain outside the
realms of "strategic practice" are at the heart of his concept of
"tactics." Because of these inherent limits, theorizations of the
political significance and possibilities of neogeography must also
include tactics.

Though not theorized as such, [tactics are in evidence in]{.underline}
many [initiatives that]{.underline} use neogeography platforms for
performance, art, and other counter-cartographic practices (kanarinka
2006; Kingsbury and Jones 2009; Perkins and Dodge 2009).3 These
performative/artistic neogeographies are characterized as political on
the basis that they parody notions of cartographic omniscience or
[**expose the inability** of]{.underline} their [representational
practices to **fully capture** human experience/perception]{.underline},
or that [they **challenge state control** over spatial data production
and circulation by **revealing**]{.underline} (and making fun of)
[**what is supposed to be secret** or **concealed**]{.underline}. Lin
(2013) engages the notion of tactics directly in her study of Chinese
neogeographers fighting rapid urbanization, forced demolition, and
illegal expropriation. In this context, the sites and practices of a
politics of ''strategy'' simply do not or cannot exist -- online
activities are tightly controlled and monitored, and citizens have
little access to formal decision-making structures. Yet citizens
concerned with forced urban removal have developed [neogeography
tactics]{.underline} that [**contest dominant narratives** and
**institutions** and **restrictions on activities** and **mobilities in
particular places**]{.underline}. For example, in one of their
Googlebased map mashups, users can ''stroll'' an off-limits lakeshore or
share artistic representations of it, virtually reclaiming and
reimagining a space that cannot be occupied in real life.4

These examples show the potential of neogeography as the basis for a
politics of [tactics]{.underline} -- a site for citizens to [**produce
new spaces** and **share counter-narratives** in a context where
**direct confrontation is not possible** and for actors who are
**excluded** from a politics of ''strategic practice.'']{.underline} As
Lin (2013) and others suggest, [attention to tactics as an **important
part** of the political repertoire of neogeography **greatly expands the
forms of politics** (and by extension, the **range of political
actors**) we can recognize]{.underline}. Yet our research with young
teens' neogeographies suggests that the significance of visual spatial
tactics extends beyond their potential as a form of political action or
civic engagement. The visual spatial tactics profiled in much of the
literature on counter-hegemonic neogeographies are largely performed by
already existing political subjects, already mobilized by their concerns
about various inequalities, injustices, or social, political, economic,
and environmental conditions. Neogeography serves as the site or space
in which these mobilized subjects perform their resistance. Our evidence
suggests that visual spatial [tactics]{.underline} in neogeography [can
have an **even more foundational significance**, serving **not just** as
a site of **political action** but as a site of **political
formation**]{.underline}. That is, we will show how visual spatial
[tactics of neogeography]{.underline} can be sites for (1) the formation
of political subjects, (2) the formation of interpretive frames that can
mobilize these subjects for action, and (3) the formation of shared
knowledge through collaborative cartographies. Neogeography praxis has
the potential to [**constitute political subjects**, **mobilized
political collectivities**, and **shared knowledge** -- the **critical
antecedents to any form of political engagement**]{.underline}.

### AT: Grove

#### Grove is [too pessimistic]{.underline} about modernity's potential---means at [best]{.underline} they solve nothing and at [worst]{.underline} they actively empower fascists. 

**Tallis, 20**---senior researcher, Institute for Peace Research and
Security Policy, University of Hamburg (Benjamin, "Un-cancelling the
future," New Perspectives, OnlineFirst, July 8, 2020, dml)

Examples of this way of thinking are plentiful but, for convenience, one
need to look no further than Jairus [Grove's]{.underline}
scintillatingly pessimistic keynote at the Hamburg Sessions (forthcoming
as an essay in NP and based on his 2019 book, Savage Ecology).3 It is
not that Grove doesn't make compelling critical [arguments]{.underline}
-- he does and in brilliant, imaginative ways -- but that they [**lack
balance**. And balance **matters**, whether we are reckoning with
horrendous pasts or trying to boldly imaging new futures.]{.underline}

[To see, or]{.underline} certainly to [dwell on, **only the bad** in
what we in the West have collectively done]{.underline} (however, Grove
or anyone else defines who we are), [over the entire course of our past
and present is **grossly unfair**. It also amounts]{.underline}, in
effect, [to a counsel of **despair**, however much Grove protests to the
contrary or claims to eschew nihilism]{.underline}. In his keynote,
having written off our past and present, [Grove]{.underline} also
explicitly [urged us]{.underline} in Europe and the West [to **stop
imagining better**, **progressive futures**]{.underline}, arguing that
this has led to precisely the problems he identified. [Grove's
critique]{.underline} thus not only leaves us out of time (without an
avowable past, present or future) but also [leaves us **without space**
for contesting negative, regressive and repressive political
trends]{.underline}. In his book, he laments the 'debilitating stupor'
in which the work of thinkers like Theodor Adorno and Giorgio Agamben
leaves us (Grove, 2019: 238). But [Grove's]{.underline} own [pessimism,
if we took it seriously]{.underline}, would leave Europeans without a
political leg to stand on. It [would leave us in]{.underline} just such
[a **stupor** -- or **worse** -- with no **solid ground** and no
**lever**: no way to **move the world** and no platform for
**positive**, **progressive change**]{.underline}.

**[Why bother, if everything we do only makes things
worse?]{.underline}**

[However much harm we]{.underline} Europeans and [Westerners have done,
we **haven't done**, **don't** and **won't only do harm**. The real
danger of Grove's type of **timelessly pessimistic** and **literally
hopeless** critique is that]{.underline} (again, if taken seriously) [it
breeds **only damaging inertia**, **inaction** and **resentment** -- its
hopelessness makes it a **debilitating** critique; its timelessness
offers **no possibility of salvage**, let alone **progress**. It **cedes
the ground** of action to those who many of us (including Grove) would
**explicitly disagree with** -- whether to exponents of
'**traditional**' approaches to IR who are **more than happy** to offer
policy advice or, worse, to **authoritarians** and **populists** in
practical politics]{.underline} (as ably described in Johanna
Sumuvuori's essay in this issue). [Critical scholars **too rarely** see
it as their task to construct **positive visions** of better worlds.
Instead, too often they content themselves]{.underline} (if no one else)
[with evermore thoroughgoing deconstructive critique]{.underline} --
including of other critical academics. Whether totalising or parasitic,
even some of its leading proponents admit that IR's critical project
has, thus far, had insufficient impact on the world at large (Austin,
2017, 2019).

Few critical scholars will thank me for this comparison, but, in their
pessimistic, misanthropic zeal, they echo what French President Emmanuel
Macron called the 'sad passions' of the author Michel Houellebecq4
(Carre\`re, 2017). They may not share Houellebecq's politics, but many
critical scholars certainly share his exhaustive (and exhausting)
disenchantment with contemporary (neo)liberal societies, the state of
Europe and of the West. Too often they also share his miserabilist
outlook on the impossibility of change for the better and the futility
or harm of even trying to improve things.

[Grove does propose several forms of political action:
**micro-kindnesses**, however **vague**]{.underline} (e.g. 'the
impossible generosity and affirmation of deconstruction', 2019: 231);
[**resistant acts** by brave individuals]{.underline} (e.g. 'William
''Fox'' Fallon, who sacrificed his prestigious position as head of \[US
Military\] Central Command because he would not go along with the plan
to attack Iran', 2019: 232); [embracing]{.underline} entirely new
'**[forms of life]{.underline}** 5 '; [or **welcoming apocalypse** as
driver of change]{.underline} (2019: 229--248). [Grove **will not be
confused with Goldilocks anytime soon** -- these forms of action each
seem either **too little** or (**much**) **too much**]{.underline}.

[Few of us would question the value of and need for
kindness]{.underline} and, indeed, the most hopeful part of Grove's book
is the touching introduction where he details many of the kindnesses he
has himself benefitted from, mainly from people in the West where he has
spent most of his life. [There is also, clearly, a role for
resistance]{.underline} and for the kinds of acts that Grove notes have
prevented executions and even nuclear war. [Yet without a **wider
programme**, without a **bigger positive vision**, kindness and
resistance **cannot sufficiently change our world** for the better.
Apocalypse]{.underline}, on the contrary, [changes **too much**, **junks
too much** that is good and is **rarely likely** to be an **appealing**
option, or something we **can all get behind**. The apocalyptic aspect
of Grove's position]{.underline}, like that of many critical scholars,
[seeks to inflict **destructive harm** on Western institutions rather
than **constructively reform** them]{.underline} -- something
Houellebecq would also relish. [Apocalyptic change]{.underline} also
[smacks of the **recklessly callous**, **negative sides**
of]{.underline} early 20th-century [futurism]{.underline} (Marinetti,
1909), [as Grove acknowledges when asking 'How do we go wild without the
cruelty of indifference?']{.underline} (2019: 280). Again, a more
balanced approach to boldness would help.

[To be clear, major change is needed]{.underline} -- that was the whole
point of the Hamburg Sessions and the motivation behind giving it the
theme of 'Un-Cancelling the Future'. I've argued elsewhere that the kind
of socio-economically regressive, technocratic, defensive liberalisms
that have dominated large parts of the last 40 years in the West have a
lot to answer for (Tallis, 2018). So too, of course, does the type of
narrowly, teleological individually atomising (neo)liberalism that
neither saw (Fukuyama, 1992) nor allowed (Fisher, 2009) alternative
visions of politics, societies and economies. Mark Fisher (2009),
echoing the artist Gerhard Richter (Elger, 2009), called this myopic
liberalism 'Capitalist Realism'. [You don't have to be a Marxist or even
a leftist to see that a **mandated lack of alternatives** and a
**commensurate narrowing of possibilities** and **horizons** is a bad
thing]{.underline}. As noted above, [both climate change and
sociotechnical upheavals in the ways we work and live **need bold
visions** to address the challenges they pose while also seizing the
opportunities they present.]{.underline}

[It is, however, eminently possible to **recognise the full horrors** of
Europe's (colonial) pasts and presents **without immediately discounting
the possibility of improvement** coming from the West]{.underline}, from
Europe. Similarly, [one can recognise the myriad problems]{.underline}
that Europeans have caused [while also **celebrating the many positive
things** they have]{.underline} also [achieved]{.underline}. Moreover,
[it is possible to use those achievements as **inspirations** for better
ways of doing things -- as **catalysts** to new, progressive creativity
and to positive visions of the future]{.underline}. Just as Kraftwerk
did in the fragile yet fertile Germany of the second half of the 20th
century when they acknowledged the abyss yet still sought a better
future, including as atonement for that past.

The cancellation of the future

William Gibson recently tweeted ''In the 1920s, the phrase 'the 21st
Century' was already popubiquitous. How often do we see the phrase ''the
22nd Century'', now?''. And it's true -- we don't have these dates
anymore. As a boy, as a young man, I had mental pictures of the 21st
Century. But I don't have any sense of 2050 or 2100 -- except as a
deterioration or a collapse. (Simon Reynolds, Hamburg Sessions 2019, see
essay in this issue)

I return to Kraftwerk below but first, a little more is needed on the
ramifications of contemporary hopelessness. Rather than striving to
create new and compelling positive, progressive visions, many thinkers
content themselves with critique (Austin, 2017) while others, like
Grove, see positive, progressive visions and futures -- especially those
coming from Europe or the wider West -- as being necessarily harmful in
themselves.

This is postmodernism as hangover. The depressed -- and depressing --
aftermath of the shortcomings, broken promises and unintended
consequences of modernisms of different kinds, in which strange
connections are made and selective, guilty memory runs amok (Fisher,
2014). Forgetting the good, it fuses the bewitchingly pertinent aspects
of the post-positivist critical project (which influenced many of us,
myself very much included), with more zealously (self-)destructive and
paralysing tendencies. As Fisher puts it: 'Deconstruction \[is\] a kind
of pathology of scepticism, which induced hedging, infirmity of purpose
and compulsory doubt' (2014: 16). In this mode, scholarship no longer
seeks to invent the train but fixates on the train crash or even
pre-empts and precludes the train's invention for fear of the seemingly
inescapable imagined train crash to come.

Like [Grove's denunciation of the future]{.underline}, many of the
critiques of (popular) modernisms [are not so much **wrong** as
**imbalanced**]{.underline} (although some are wrong of course, others
not even). [They take **insufficient account** of modernisms'
**multiple** and **meaningful successes**]{.underline} (there's no time
here, but see, e.g. Fisher, 2014: 22; or Meades, 2014, for a flavour).
This leaves us in an odd situation where many of [the
scholars]{.underline}, commentators and others [who criticise
neoliberalism]{.underline}, capitalist realism and so on, [find
themselves in **de facto agreement** with its notion that there should
be no alternative. In this view, we **simply shouldn't do big vision
politics** because our 'schemes to improve the human condition' have not
only 'failed' but will **always**, **inevitably**, do **more harm than
good**]{.underline} (Scott, 2008). [This approach, all post and no
modern, will take us **nowhere**, even as it **fast-forwards the
academic careers** of its exponents]{.underline}.

The future visions that are left, on the left, tend to be Marxist ones
(see, e.g. Grove, 2019: 198-- 202). Tarred not only by the brush of the
communisms that actually existed (and their distinctly less balanced
ledger than that of modernism more widely) they understandably fail to
inspire mass enthusiasm. Many of their proponents are still really more
interested in explaining the failure to bring about the inevitable (full
communism) in the past and present than in imagining new futures that go
beyond the narrow world view and limiting subjectivity of too many
Marxist approaches (see, e.g. Scribner, 2003; Sˇitera, 2015). This has
done little to address the crisis of hope or to countervail prevalent
contemporary pessimism.

[The loss of the belief in the progressive future]{.underline} -- that
tomorrow can be better than yesterday and today -- [and the related
erosion of faith in our ability to **positively shape our own
destiny**]{.underline} are what Berardi (2011: 13) called 'the slow
cancellation of the future'. As Simon Reynolds noted in his Hamburg
Sessions keynote (included in this issue of NP), the cancellation may
have started slowly in the 1970s, but, by the 2000s, it had picked up
speed and its effects could start to be seen. The first of these -- its
more (neo)liberal variant -- was the feeling of living in an endless
present. For a lot of people in the West, this has been comfortable in
many ways (although often unevenly and unfairly) and has had distinct
advantages over the past (the extension of rights and opportunities to
broader swathes of the population) but without much hope, optimism or
greater purpose. Unless it provokes the nostalgic responses outlined
below, this endless present [can lead to a sense of **ennui**, a **lack
of direction** and **loss of momentum**]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} second, **[more overtly sinister]{.underline}**,
[variant that fills the vacuum left by the dearth of positive,
progressive visions for the future takes the form of **darker
re-enchantments** focused on the (imagined) past]{.underline} (e.g.
Campanella and Dassu\`, 2019). [Whether '**making America great
again**', '**taking back control**' in the United Kingdom or claiming to
offer an '**alternative for Germany**', these movements are
fundamentally premised on a **backward-looking politics** of
nostalgia]{.underline}. The [pessimism about the present and worries
about the future]{.underline} on which these movements have each
capitalised [have given rise to an **increasingly defensive politics**
of closing down and protecting, at the expense of opening up and
integrating. Nativism and pessimism tend to go **hand in hand**:
shrinking pies bring narrowed horizons and hasten the circling of wagons
around **exclusive** and **chauvinistic visions** of national
communities]{.underline}. Too often, this retro-rightism has been met
only with retro-leftism or a tired centrism that merely seeks more of
the same, to smooth the endless present. But that can change \...

Reclaiming the spirit of Kraftwerk

[COVID-19]{.underline} has cancelled the endless present6 -- or at least
it can if we make the best of it. The scale of the response to the
pandemic [highlights the degree to which **radical change is possible**
if people are **persuaded** of the need. This crisis **will be** (and is
**already being**) used politically. The challenge for those of us who
want a more progressive future is to ensure that the disruption caused
by COVID-19 is put to **positive effect** -- to ensure that it is
**creative** rather than **wanton disruption** -- and to spur the kind
of action that can **address our biggest challenges** but also to create
new opportunities to **make a better**]{.underline} 'Post-Coronial'
**[world]{.underline}** (Tallis and Renic, 2020).

From climate change to the changing world of work, [bold action is
needed to address the causes of our biggest problems rather than simply
alleviating their symptoms]{.underline}. But also [seeing these issues
as **possibilities** to be seized for progressive improvement, rather
than just seeing them as **problems** to be managed will be
**key**]{.underline}. As Merje Kuus was at pains to emphasise in her
Hamburg Sessions keynote, perspective is vital (see her essay in this
issue). [Building]{.underline} resilient societies and [a more equitable
global order calls for the political will to **formulate** and **make
the case for positive proactive policy**, not]{.underline} the
**[piecemeal passivity]{.underline}**, timid tinkering [or
(**critical**) **conservatism**]{.underline} that have characterised too
much of European politics and public debate in recent times.

### AT: Humanism Bad

#### They have it [backwards]{.underline}---even if modernity's violence [originated]{.underline} in humanism, it's [evolved]{.underline} into an attempt to [overcome human categories]{.underline} that sounds a [lot]{.underline} like the alt.

**Featherstone, 20**---senior lecturer in Sociology at Keele University
(Mark, "Simmel's (non-human) humanism: On Simmel's 'ethics of endings
and futures'," Journal of Classic Sociology, May 1, 2020, dml)

Following Simmel's own death of liver cancer in 1918, the Futurists
would, of course, make use of [art to represent **modern mobility** and
**endless change**]{.underline}, but there is, I think, a significant
difference between what Marinetti and others (e.g. Umberto Boccioni)
wanted to represent and what Simmel saw in Rembrandt's works of the
seventeenth century. Where the Futurists [celebrated the **movement**,
**speed**, and]{.underline} in a sense [the **anonymous flows of life**
that symbolise the **death of every form**, **organism**, and
**structure**]{.underline}, [Simmel's Rembrandt is more about
**recognising the limit of death** in order to reflect upon the
**fragile beauty** and **limitless value of life** in temporary form
capable of inspiring the **creation of human meaning** and
**significance** beyond the violence of life in itself]{.underline}. In
respect of their [love for the violence of life stripped
bare]{.underline}, the Futurists [would more likely identify with the
**anonymous flows**]{.underline} of Simmel's money economy [where
meaning **disappears** before bare objectivity]{.underline}, while the
conclusion Simmel himself reaches in Rembrandt is that life only takes
on value inside the formal structures that make it matter precisely
because they have and are made by their limits. This is, in his
language, the true significance of 'the metaphysics of death' (see
Simmel, 2007 \[1910\]). As Simmel (2015 \[1918\]: 69) explains in his
final work, 'death\...appears as the shaper of life'.

This understanding of the value of death is, of course, a lesson we can
also learn from Borges' (2000) short story The Immortal where Borges
imagines what endless life would look like. While we might imagine
immortal creatures displaying the highest levels of intellectual and
cultural development and so on, Borges reveals the truth of endless life
in the slovenly immortals who have degenerated to the level of the
lowest beasts, precisely because they have no limits, no future, no
reason to do anything. The key point of this example is, therefore, that
[life takes on meaning **only** when we become aware of the '**border of
death**' and we can only think significant thoughts on the basis of our
**ignorance** of what lay on the other side]{.underline}. Following
Heidegger (2010) who saw that authenticity relied on what he called
being-towards-death, Simmel (2015 \[1918\]) was led to the conclusion
that [life **matters most** when it **teeters on the brink**, when it
runs up against the **edge of death**, and we face **looming
catastrophe** and **potential apocalypse**]{.underline} (World War I and
his own failing health), where the Greek word 'apocalypsis' means
'revealing' or 'uncovering'. Thus, the borderline (See Simmel, 2007
\[1908\]), the dividing line between two states, is key in Simmel's
final works. Indeed, Beer (2019) very skilfully explains this over the
course of his book and in particular when he reflects upon Simmel's
concept of 'world', which refers to the symbolic forms we live through
in the name of making sense.

Given this reading of Simmel's final works, we might conclude that [the
**key problem** of the present is founded in the **violence of late
capitalist global economy**, which has **colonised life itself** and
subjected every meaningful form to the **necessity to move** for the
sake of circulation and]{.underline} what Simmel (2015 \[1918\]) calls
'**[more life]{.underline}**'. What should be clear, however, from the
above is that in the Simmelian universe [the issue with the **wholesale
identification** with life and 'more life' is that it also represents
the death of '**more than life**', the death of **form**, the death of
**significance**, and in a sense the death of **death
itself**]{.underline}. Although we might imagine that the effort to
eliminate death represents a positive move, Beer (2019) explains [that
the hypertrophy of life and the atrophy of form reflects the way in
which the human world '**wounds**' and **destroys** itself to **free
anonymous post-human flows**]{.underline}. Against the endless
transformations of life in itself (endless circulation, metabolism),
Beer's 'late Simmel' looks to embrace the limit of death in order to
impose some meaningful form upon 'the quantitative vastness of
existence'. In this way, Beer shows how Simmel suggests the construction
of worlds able to make life matter and provides his reader with a model
to read Simmel into the non-humanism of the contemporary moment.
Reflecting upon the excessive nature of communication in the
hyper-connected, hyper-related society, Beer (2019) notes that we need
to find ways to make sense and build worlds. However, what he does not
do is extend this theory of the need for what we might call worlding to
an exploration of the violence of the global money economy and the
politics of post-/non-/more-than-/humanism.

In my view, [the **problem** of the politics of
**post-/non-/more-than/humanism** is the key to
understanding]{.underline} the relevance of Simmel's work today. As we
have seen above, the central issue of the global money economy,
particularly under [the **political ideology of
neoliberalism**]{.underline} where everything is understood in economic
terms (see Davies (2014) on this point\], is that [the identification
with anonymous flows **destroys any understanding** of limits and
endings that might **enable the formation of a meaningful world** able
to shape the future. Even though it might be the case that this
situation **sprang** from the philosophy of **humanism**]{.underline}, a
humanism of the Godlike nature of the human vis-à-vis the rest of
existence that becomes a Heideggerian (1977) 'standing reserve', [the
truth is that it is has now **transgressed itself** in the emergence of
a **violent technological post-humanism** that identifies with the
**anonymous flows of life** beyond the formal limits of anything we
might call 'human'. This **violent transformation** of humanism into
post-humanism is]{.underline}, of course, [behind the economic ideas of
**endless growth**, **endless work**, and **endless profit** founded
upon a **liberal**, **capitalist fantasy** that flows of life are in
themselves **infinite**, **limitless**, and **endlessly open** for
exploitation, monetisation, and capitalisation]{.underline}. Despite the
apocalypticism of Swedish Teenagers, School strikes, and social
movements (Extinction Rebellion), this vision of limitlessness persists
in the institutions of late capitalism.
