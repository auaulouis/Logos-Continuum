#### Slavery must be theorized as [maximum captivity]{.underline} to produce a [structural analysis]{.underline} capable of coming to terms with the world

**Sexton 8** (Jared Sexton, Director of African American Studies at UC
Irvine, 2008, "Amalgamation Schemes: Antiblackness and the Critique of
Multiracialism", pages 111-114) FYI: Randall Kennedy is "one of the
first black scholars in this generation to pen a sustained argument
advocating what he terms 'a cosmopolitan ethos that welcomes the
prospect of genuine, loving interracial intimacy' " (page 107-108)

In response to the last question, we examine several comments from
Kennedy's opening chapter, "In the Age of Slavery." As noted, [Kennedy
is at pains to counter the claims of a]{.underline} certain [black
feminist history regarding the]{.underline} "extremity of power"
exercised by the slaveholder and "[the absolute submission required of
the slave]{.underline}" (Hartman, quoted in Kennedy 2003, 532fn11). [He
is]{.underline}, in other words, [attempting to
demonstrate]{.underline}, or at least to speculate upon, [the limits of
the slave system's power of domination. Beyond this limit---whose locus
proves frustratingly obscure---the agency of the slave herself was, we
are told, able to affect significantly the conditions of captivity to
alternate ends. **Kennedy**]{.underline}, in other words, **[proffers a
narrative in which]{.underline}** evidence of agency (evidence, that is,
confirming **[an assumption of agency]{.underline}**), **[however
circumscribed or practically ineffective, is taken as a sign of
resistance]{.underline}**. More properly, [this is a narrative of
resistant affection, an insistence that the dehumanizing social order of
racial slavery was unable to achieve its ultimate goal---"the absolute
submission of the slave"---because it could not overcome the
irresistible force of affection between men and women, "regardless of
color."]{.underline} When all is said and done, [a human is still a
human]{.underline}, as it were, [and the family romance of normative
heterosexuality persists "even within" hierarchies that preclude for the
captive all of the recognizable]{.underline} (social, political,
economic, cultural, legal) [trappings of "human being" in the modern
sense. Here is Kennedy: The slave system failed]{.underline}, however,
to perfect the domination that \[ Judge Thomas\] Ruffin envisioned. It
failed [to bind the slaves so tightly as to deprive them of all room to
maneuver]{.underline}. It failed to wring from them all prohibited
yearnings. Slavery was, to be sure, a horribly oppressive system that
severely restricted the ambit within which its victims could make
decisions. But slavery did not extinguish altogether the possibility of
choice. (43) [We might ask, **what is the minimum ambit of decision
making**]{.underline}? **[What sort of system, if not slavery, would
bind one so tightly as to deprive one of all "room to
maneuver]{.underline}**"? **[Need a system of domination be "perfect" in
order for it to be legally binding or socially effective or politically
determinant]{.underline}**? **[Need the captive body be deprived of all
room to maneuver for the situation to be considered one of
extremity]{.underline}**? **[Need the yearnings of slaves be wrung
entirely from them for their prohibition to be considered a constitutive
element of life]{.underline}**? **[At what point does the quantitative
measure of the slave's bondage become difference of a qualitative
sort]{.underline}**? **[What precisely is the "choice" available under
slavery, and is it one worthy of belaboring, one whose sphere of
influence is to be considered newsworthy]{.underline}**? To put a finer
point on it, why is **[the categorical discrepancy refused
between]{.underline}** the free and the enslaved, or more specifically,
between [the slave and the slaveholder]{.underline}?
**[Is]{.underline}** such refusal not **[tantamount to denying the very
existence of slavery as a system that produced slaves rather than free
people whose freedom was simply "severely restricted" or whose power was
simply "severely limited" or who simply faced "difficult
situations"]{.underline}**? Kennedy continues: Bondage severely limited
the power---including the sexual power---of slaves. But it did not
wholly erase their capacity to attract and shape affectionate, erotic
attachments of all sorts, including interracial ones. In a
hard-to-quantify but substantial number of cases, feelings of affection
and attachment between white male masters and their black female slaves
somehow survived slavery's deadening influence. The great difficulty, in
any particular instance, lies in determining whether sex between a male
master and a female slave was an expression of sexual autonomy or an act
of unwanted sex. The truth is that most often we cannot know for sure,
since there exists little direct testimony from those involved,
especially the enslaved women. (44) [The inability to
quantify]{.underline} the "number of cases" or, indeed, [to "know for
sure" anything about them]{.underline} does not prevent the author from
considering them nonetheless "substantial," [and the paucity of direct
testimony,6 "especially \[from\] the enslaved women," does not stop the
author from extrapolating wildly]{.underline} about said "feelings of
affection and attachment" between them and their "white male masters."
In fact, it is the void in its place---the great historic
silence---[that enables both the reiteration of longstanding **alibis**
for white male sexual violence]{.underline}---what Hartman (1997)
discusses skillfully as the "ruses of seduction"---[and the projection
of this newfangled, though no less menacing, **story about a maverick
interracial intimacy that**, almost undetectably, **undermines the
injunctions of white supremacy, serving not only as a sign of agency for
enslaved women but a moment of their resistance as well**. Their "sexual
power" is expressed as the "capacity to attract"---and "somehow" to
manipulate---the erotic attachments of white male slaveholders. There is
here an unsubtle shift in terms]{.underline}: [agency is not in itself
subversive]{.underline}; indeed, [the]{.underline} entire [slave system
**derives**]{.underline}, in large part, [from the agency of the
enslaved]{.underline} (**[its capture, manipulation,
redeployment]{.underline}**, etc.) (Chandler 2000). Agency may be
resistant or complicit or both, and it may or may not have practical
effects in the world; all of this can only be determined contextually.
[Much more troubling]{.underline} than Kennedy's imprecision here,
however, [is]{.underline} his entirely [uncritical suggestion about the
"sexual power" of slaves**. Is not one of the principal conceits of
power to suggest that though the dominant may monopolize
power**]{.underline} political, economic, and social, **[the dominated
nonetheless enjoy a wily aptitude for "getting their way" by other
means, namely]{.underline}**, the ars erotica of
**[seduction]{.underline}**? [Is not one of the most pernicious elements
of the proslavery discourse that the "attractiveness" of enslaved black
women presents a threat of corruption to civilized white manhood
and]{.underline}/or [an internal guarantee against the excesses of
state-sanctioned violence reserved for white slaveholders]{.underline}?
**[The same quality that served as temptation was also]{.underline}**,
or alternately, taken to be that which would forestall the descent of
slaveholding into unrestrained brutality, [**an essential
rationalization for the upholding of white (male) impunity toward
blacks**, whether enslaved or nominally "free"]{.underline} (Hartman
1997).7 Finally, **[was not the suggestion that enslaved black men might
have the power to seduce white women]{.underline}** (whether free or, in
earlier periods, indentured) **[one of the prime alibis for the
construction of regulatory or prohibitory statutes around interracial
marriage and sexual relations from the seventeenth century
onward]{.underline}** (Bardaglio 1999)? **[In each case, the focus on
the "sexual power" of slaves was undoubtedly a displacement of the
organized violence consistently required of captivity and, further, a
dissimulation of the institutionalized sexual power of slaveholders in
particular]{.underline}** (whose authority not only foreclosed the
possibility of prosecution and militated against the extralegal
reprisals but also contributed immeasurably to their "capacity to
attract and shape affectionate, erotic attachments of all kinds." **[The
asymmetry here approaches the incommensurable---how, after all, would a
slave go on to "court" a master? How would such an exercise in
self-objectification, supplementing structural availability with an
affirmation of "willingness," rightly be called power?).]{.underline}**
[This is no less the case simply because for Kennedy]{.underline} [the
"sexual power" of slaves is something to honor or celebrate rather than
to fear]{.underline}.

#### Their cost-benefit calculation creates anti-black fantasies that condemn blacks to [repetition]{.underline} of impersonal death -- infatuation with the "contingency" of "material change" [disavows]{.underline} libidinal investments

**Leong 16** -- PhD UC Irvine - Assistant Professor, English, University
of Utah - Assistant Professor, Environmental Humanities Graduate
Program, University of Utah (Diana, "The Mattering of Black Lives:
Octavia Butler's Hyperempathy and the Promise of the New Materialisms,"
Catalyst: Feminism, Theory, Technoscience, 2(2), 1-35)

Black lives matter and black lives matter and black lives matter. This
homographic reading of the most salient political statement of recent
years speaks to the torsions of blackness, matter, and life that have
come to define our contemporary era. In "Unbearable Blackness," Jared
Sexton (2015) argues with regard to the triangulation of these concerns
that [antiblack fantasies "do not render blacks, like so much of the
planet, subject to death in an economy of disposability; rather, they
subject blacks to 'the **interminable time** of meaningless,
**impersonal dying**'"]{.underline} (p.168). In the wake of recent grand
jury decisions not to prosecute the murders of Tamir Rice, Eric Garner,
and Michael Brown, to name only the most widely publicized cases,
Sexton's claims register most strongly in the state's refusal to allow
these deaths to die. They are caught instead in a biopolitical apparatus
that suspends racial blackness between a life unrecognized as such and
an illegible form of death that can never pass into reason. Against this
timeless, spectral dying, we can read the declaration that "Black Lives
Matter" as a call to return racial blackness to a form that matters, to
a form, in other words, that is matter. On this score, I ask: how do
black life and death become matter, and what is at stake in the demand
that they should assume such form? Octavia Butler's Afrofuturist novels
Parable of the Sower (1993) and Parable of the Talents (1998) dramatize
these questions through protagonist Lauren Olamina and her condition of
hyperempathy. [In this article, I explore hyperempathy as a speculative
embodiment of "pornotroping" (Spillers, 2003) to understand how racial
blackness structures current theorizations of matter.]{.underline}
Questions about the proper scale, scope, and character of matter have
assumed a renewed sense of urgency given the emergence of the
Anthropocene, a distinct geological epoch in which human activity has
become so influential as to alter fundamental aspects of the Earth
System. While ecologist Eugene Stoermer and Nobel Prize-winning
atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen introduced the current definition of
the term in the 1980s, we have since witnessed a growing scientific
consensus about the rigor of the concept. A recent article published in
the journal Science by the Anthropocene Working Group (2016) provides
the latest example of this support, demonstrating that fluctuations in
the content and pace of sediment deposits and extinction rates are
anthropogenically driven. However, the very nomenclature of the
"Anthropocene" has been subject to critique from within the humanities
for allowing an abstract notion of the "Anthropos" to anchor an implicit
philosophy of history. Daniel Hartley (2015), for instance, comments in
a recent issue of the UK-based magazine Salvage, "Inherent to the
Anthropocene discourse is a conception of historical causality which is
purely mechanical: a one-onone billiard ball model of technological
invention and historical effect, which is simply inadequate to explain
actual social and relational modes of historical causation" (para. 4).
Hartley takes special issue with the presumed origins of the
Anthropocene, which many geologists date to the industrial and nuclear
revolutions. This determination, he suggests, interprets the
environmental impact of technology as the "net effect" of an
undifferentiated "human" activity (Waters et. al., 2016, p. 139). In
order to assert a causal link between technological development and
ecological catastrophe, any consideration of the roles race, class, and
gender have played in engineering our historical present must be
obscured.1 The benefits and consequences of technological development
and environmental disaster, after all, are rarely if ever distributed
symmetrically among and within human populations. "It is not all people
that are indicted by the onset of the Anthropocene," writes Nicholas
Mirzoeff (forthcoming 2016), "but a specific set: colonial settlers,
enslavers, and would-be imperialists" (pp. 19-20). At the same time,
this remodeling of human history and ecological philosophy is not unique
to geologists. Indeed, the Anthropocene's scientific definition may have
become matters of debate only recently, but its constitutive
concerns---global warming, genetic technology, biodiversity loss,
environmental racism---have thrown our prevailing concepts of nature and
culture into crisis well before the epoch's formal identification. At
stake is not only the fate of homo sapiens as a species, but also the
basic composition of a world yet to come. The challenges of analyzing
the effects of non-human systems (e.g., weather patterns or ocean
currents) and actors (e.g., viruses or pesticides) while attending to
the uneven distribution of environmental risks and resources have
generated a range of philosophical responses. For example, publications
like Dipesh Chakrabarty's (2009), "The Climate of History," Elizabeth
Kolbert's (2014) The Sixth Extinction, and Roy Scranton's (2015)
Learning to Die in the Anthropocene recommend a universal or existential
"species thinking" necessary for grasping the complexities of climate
change. Other responses, like Jane Bennett's (2010) Vibrant Matter and
Jeffrey Jerome Cohen's (2015) Stone, interrogate fantasies of human
mastery as a way of reckoning with the power of non-human agents. Over
the last decade, one particular variety of response has acquired
critical purchase within the academic left: the new materialisms. As
part of what Richard Grusin (2015) has named "the nonhuman turn" in
contemporary thought, the new materialisms join affect theory, critical
animal studies, and object-oriented ontology in calling for enhanced
attention to matter and materiality. The popularity of this approach,
evidenced by a growing number of monographs, special journal issues, and
anthologies, appears grounded in the need to develop strategies of
coexistence attuned to the Anthropocene's political and ecological
crises.2 How, for example, should we understand agency and embodiment in
light of recent developments in biotechnology and the increasingly
unpredictable behavior of non-human objects? The promise of the new
materialisms thus inheres in the notion that a focus on materiality can
offer us more comprehensive and efficacious ways to respond to these
developments. As Diana Coole and Samantha Frost (2010) write in their
introduction to the New Materialisms anthology, "What is at stake here
is nothing less than a challenge to some of the most basic assumptions
that have underpinned the modern world, including its normative sense of
the human and its beliefs about human agency, but also regarding its
material practices such as the ways we labor on, exploit, and interact
with nature" (p. 4). There is much to recommend an intensified
engagement with matter, not least of which is Coole and Frost's proposal
that such engagements can disrupt our "normative sense of the human" and
of "human agency." Given this professed interest in dismantling human
exceptionalism, it is curious then that, as Zakiyyah Jackson (2015) and
other critical race scholars point out, the new materialisms have
systematically "\[ignored\] praxes of humanity and critiques produced by
black people, particularly those praxes which are irreverent to the
normative production of 'the human' or illegible from within the terms
of its logic" (p. 216).3 Black thought has long challenged the enforced
description of Africans and their descendants as non-human objects of
science, as specimens for study and experimentation, as commodities for
market exchange, as things. In fact, from at least the 16th century
onward, black bodies provided crucial raw material for the development
of natural history, the natural sciences, and the life philosophies in
Enlightenment thought.4 Both geology and biology, for example, pursued
notions of species and evolution that preserved early racial taxonomies;
the techniques of observation and interpretation used to analyze
geological activity were the same as those employed by the racial
science of phrenology. Mirzoeff (forthcoming 2016) leverages this
history to argue that "the very concept of observable breaks between
geological eras in general and the definition of the Anthropocene in
particular is inextricably intermingled with the belief in distinct
races of humanity" (p. 2). His claim that the concept of the
Anthropocene reproduces race-making technologies gestures to the
historical fact that the human as such has emerged through the exclusion
and extermination of black bodies. Proscribed from the realm of the
human, black intellectuals have had to think within and through the
categories of the non-human and the inhuman to pursue new ways of being
in the world. Philosophical questions about the vitality and agency of
the human, the animal, and the object are therefore longstanding in the
fields of Black studies. Alexander Weheliye (2015) observes in Habeas
Viscus that across Sylvia Wynter's oeuvre, "it is the human---or
different genres of the human---that materializes as the object of
knowledge in the conceptual mirror of black studies" (p. 21). The
scholarly work of Hortense Spillers (2003) and Fred Moten (2003), and
the Afrofuturist contributions of Nalo Hopkinson (1998; 2000) and Nnedi
Okorafor (2010), similarly confront the "most basic assumptions that
have underpinned the modern world," including our notions of history,
temporality, and modern science.5 And yet, as it is with the
Anthropocene's implied philosophy of history, much of the scholarship
produced under the banner of the new materialisms tends to reduce race
to a crude "identity politics" or to endorse a model of
difference-withoutrace.6 This reduction and disavowal of race, I
contend, is something of a structural necessity for the new
materialisms. In what follows, I trace the general theoretical
principles of the new materialisms to a dissatisfaction with the
linguistic and cultural paradigms of post-structuralism. I then
demonstrate how this dissatisfaction enables an ethics of relation or
affect that further legitimizes the reduction and dismissal of race.
However, as a close reading of Butler's Parable duology reveals, one of
the primary figures of the new materialisms---the material body---is
defined by and through disavowed social fantasies about black female
flesh that are linked to the global legacies of modern slavery. My
examination of the critical responses to Butler's novels further
suggests that such fantasies are necessary to secure a libidinal
investment in the ethical potential of materiality. I argue, thus,
against a misrecognition of black female flesh as a resource against the
violence of hierarchical differences, rather than the site of their
active production. Finally, I turn to a reading of Butler's Parable
duology as an allegory about the dangers of proceeding in the
Anthropocene without a robust analysis of the formation of racial
blackness. Because a proper survey of new materialist literature is
beyond the scope of this article, the comments below should be taken as
entry points for probing the (absent) place of racial blackness in
theories about matter.7 The promise of the new materialisms The new
materialisms are drawn from a long genealogy of philosophical
materialism, in which Spinoza, Nietzsche, Bergson, Marx, and Deleuze are
cited as major touchstones. In recognition of this legacy, Coole and
Frost (2010) assert that the interventions loosely gathered by the term
"new materialisms" are better "categorized as renewed materialisms,"
with the qualifier "new" acknowledging the "unprecedented" ecological,
biological, and technological conditions under which we currently live
and labor (p. 4, italics in original). Although their specific objects
of analysis are appropriately diverse, the new materialisms collectively
insist on a post-humanist matter that is lively, self-directed,
agential, creative, and always in the process of becoming. In this
regard, matter is better thought of as materialization, or the process
by which complex phenomena are temporarily and contingently stabilized
to varying degrees. The ontological shift entailed here is towards a
philosophical monism, inspired most notably by the work of Deleuze.
Following Spinoza and Bergson, Deleuze (1994) develops a notion of the
virtual as a generative field of difference, or a "plane of immanence,"
where "all the varieties of differential relations and all the
distributions of singular points \[coexist\] in diverse orders
'perplicated' in one another" (p. 206). These differences are then
formatted into distinct phenomena or entities by processes of
actualization that "\[bring\] the object back into relation with the
field of differential relations in which it can always be dissolved and
become actualized otherwise, as something else, by being linked through
other differential relations to other particles" (Cheah, 2010, pp.
85-86). While not all new materialist theories cleave to a strictly
Deleuzian philosophy, there is general agreement that the dynamic
interactions among objects, bodies, and phenomena turn us away from the
Anthropocene's "billiard ball model" of causality, and more
significantly, away from some of poststructuralism's critical trends.
According to the new materialisms, the linguistic and cultural turns of
the last half century have resulted in both an intellectual and a
political poverty. Specifically, social constructivism (Coole & Frost,
2010) and cultural representationalism (Barad, 2007) have overdetermined
matter to the extent that it appears as a passive product made
meaningful only through cultural and discursive practice. Coole and
Frost (2010) even write of a theoretical "exhaustion," claiming that
they "share the feeling current among many researchers that the dominant
constructivist orientation to social analysis is inadequate for thinking
about matter, materiality, and politics in ways that do justice to the
contemporary context of biopolitics and global political economy" (p.
6). Somewhere and sometime during the rise of the Anthropocene, cultural
theory, broadly conceived, lost its explanatory power. This assessment
of inadequacy repeats across much of the recent new materialist
scholarship, condensing the cultural turn into a discursive reductionism
that rebuffs the empirical for the ideal, or the material for the
symbolic. Elizabeth Grosz's (2004) The Nick of Time opens with a telling
"reminder to social, political, and cultural theorists, particularly
those interested in feminism, antiracism, and questions of the politics
of globalization, that they have forgotten a crucial dimension of
research...not just the body, but that which makes it possible and which
limits its actions: the precarious, accidental, contingent, expedient,
striving, dynamic status of life in a messy, complicated, resistant,
brute world of materiality" (p. 2). Social, political, and cultural
theory, in other words, have overlooked the material conditions of life
that render the body available for inscription and enculturation in the
first instance. So too in the recently published Gut Feminism does
Elizabeth Wilson (2015) rebuke "social constructionism" for "\[tending\]
not to be very curious about the details of empirical claims in
genetics, neurophysiology, evolutionary biology, pharmacology or
biochemistry" (p. 3). [Her ensuing conclusion is that focusing on how
social structures produce and discipline bodies comes at the expense of
recognizing the ways bodies radically alter and organize social
structures themselves. It appears that cultural theory harbors an
"allergy to 'the real'" that dissuades "critical inquirers from the more
empirical kinds of investigation that material processes and structures
require"]{.underline} (Coole & Frost, 2010, p. 6). However, [the very
aspects that would make matter more "real" than language or culture are
the same aspects that restrict its **ethical potential** and
**facilitate a conceptual rejection of race**]{.underline}. In line with
their post-humanist agenda, the new materialisms evoke matter and
materiality as existing in excess of human subjectivity and its
attendant domains. Mechanistic theories of causality hold that objects
are composed of inert matter acted upon by external forces, which
presumes that an object's potential or possible capabilities are already
present and fixed in some initial moment of creation. But, as the new
materialisms emphasize, the virtual field of differential relations is
immanent to matter in such a way that it is impossible to anticipate all
of the effects a material configuration may have, or the organizational
forms it may take. This ability to act independently of the subject's
will and desire is variously construed as "impersonal and preindividual
forces," an alterity that "comes from outside the capability or power of
the subject" (Cheah, 2010, p. 80, 89), "degrees of indetermination" that
represent the "'true principle of life'" (Grosz, 2010, p. 149), and a
"powerful reminder...that life will always exceed our knowledge and
control" (Bennett, 2010, p.14). Differences in terminology aside, the
new materialisms are united by an understanding of materiality as a
spectral, impersonal force with material effects, one that escapes
reason and disrupts systems of meaning, including modernist binaries
like mind/body, culture/nature, and inside/outside (Dolphijn & van der
Tuin, 2012). The latter aspect is key because, while matter can
frustrate representation, its "excessive" properties do not mean that it
exists "outside" of the subject. Rather, matter and materiality are
"real" because they actively produce reality in unpredictable ways
(Cheah, 2010). It is here that the ethical impetus of the new
materialist project is located. If we accept our embeddedness in
mutually transformative, nonhuman networks, the ground of ethics shifts
accordingly. First, a responsibility to an externalized other gives way
to an accountability for the many relations that constitute becoming.
And second, ethics are no longer reducible to the decisions or actions
of individuals that are initiated by a properly historical judgment. In
Rosi Braidotti's (2010) terms, "Accepting the impossibility of mutual
recognition and replacing it with one of mutual specification and mutual
codependence is what is at stake in postsecular affirmative ethics" (p.
214). I find nothing immediately problematic with an ethics that aspires
to keep pace with advancements in science, philosophy, and technology.
What I find troublesome is how our acquiescence to these ethics is
solicited. New materialist ethics necessarily manifest as affective
encounters that operate best on micropolitical scales. Because
materiality is figured as an impersonal force of the real, it runs the
risk of becoming a transcendental signified that merely replaces
language or culture as an organizing principle. Doing so would severely
diminish its import as an inducement to a posthumanist ethics. [To
circumvent the]{.underline} "[tension between **universalistic**
theory]{.underline} and **[specific]{.underline}** mode of
[inquiry]{.underline}," chance, **[contingency]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[creativity]{.underline}** in micro-level encounters
[are prioritized over]{.underline} more [**obstinate** assemblages that
**congeal at**]{.underline} the **[global]{.underline}** or
macro-[levels]{.underline} (Zhan, 2016, p. 26). Further, as the nucleus
of the new materialisms, the embodied subject or material body compels
an ethics that unfolds on a parallel plane, meaning between and within
bodies. "This implies," Rosi Braidotti (2010) proposes, "approaching the
world through affectivity and not cognition: as singularity, force,
movement, through assemblages or webs of interconnections with all that
lives," and "accepting the impossibility of mutual recognition and
replacing it with one of mutual specification and mutual codependence"
(p. 214). In the quotation above, Braidotti invokes an ethics of
relation, in which sensation and perception comprise the "zone of
\[ethical\] effectivity," and attunement and affirmation take precedence
over social transformation (Tumino, 2011, p. 555). Because material
inter- and intraactions are preconscious and multisensorial, ethical
practice is based not on the ability to evaluate right from wrong, but
on a commitment to feeling right. We can observe this adjustment in
appeals to "an ongoing responsiveness to...entanglement" (Barad, 2007,
p. 394), "a heightened sensitivity to the agency of assemblages"
(Bennett, 2010b), a "wakefulness" to the "feel \[of\] what makes us
laugh, lament, and curse" (Orlie, 2007, p. 127) and an "experience of
the vitality of being" (Connolly, 2010, pp. 196-197). As a consequence,
[the **experiences** of living under conditions of crisis are
**fetishized** at the expense of **addressing the causes** of these
conditions themselves]{.underline}. [The imperative to "\[live\] with
the open wound\...through a sort of **depersonalization** of the
event]{.underline}" (Braidotti, 2010, p. 213), for example, [not only
depoliticizes the claims of historically oppressed communities, but also
**flattens distinctions** between traumas inflicted through
**happenstance** and **persistent intergenerational harm**.]{.underline}
How else could one, as Braidotti does, list as equivalent examples:
those who survived the Holocaust, Frida Kahlo's deadly tram ride, and
missing the train to the World Trade Center on September 11th (p. 214)?
The limits of a new materialist ethics appear most forcefully, then, as
we attempt to move from an embodied "responsiveness" to the dislocation
of structures. When patterns of materialization are addressed, it is
generally as the amalgamation of "perpetual circuits of exchange,
feedback, and reentry" that thereby "\[inflect\] the shape of political
experience" (Connolly, 2010, pp. 190-191). On the one hand, there is
nothing innately objectionable about attributing the creation and
transformation of political structures to any number of quotidian,
embodied experiences. This is in fact common in political theory and
historiography.8 On the other hand, [it becomes]{.underline} more
[difficult to reconcile]{.underline} the effects of chance,
unpredictability, and **[indeterminacy]{.underline}** [with the
**endurance** and **repetition** of]{.underline} something like
antiblack violence.9 [The new materialisms are therefore at pains to
clarify why the structures of global antiblackness continue to function
as if "neither time nor history, nor historiography and its topics, show
movement, as the human subject is 'murdered' over and over again by the
passions of a bloodless and anonymous archaism, showing itself in
endless disguise"]{.underline} (Spillers, 2003, p. 208). [Interpreting
and describing our entanglements with non-human, materialist forces are
not enough to account for, much less dislodge attachments to, social
categories and representational arrangements. By this I mean that
becoming more aware of material forces will not inevitably reduce the
weight of discursive or **psychic formations**. It could even **obstruct
change** by making forms of affect and sensation newly **available for
inscription**]{.underline}. As Timothy Morton (2007) states, when
"contact becomes content," perceptions of difference collapse into
identity (p. 37). Granted, these complications are not unique to the new
materialisms as changes in scale almost always require a re-calibration
of ethics. The point is, however, that the framing of the new
materialisms as inherently more ethical generates, and is generated by,
a disavowal or misreading of race as a stagnant analytical framework. As
I submit above, since at least the Enlightenment period intellectual
genealogies have maintained an almost overwhelming racial homogeneity.
Critical theories produced by non-white scholars may have increased in
terms of production or representation, but these are consistently marked
as minority perspectives that have little to do with universal or
ontological questions.10 Hence, black bodies especially are rendered
objects for theoretical development, rather than subjects of universal
philosophy. Coole and Frost (2010) continue this trend, revealing that
even as "feminists and class theorists have often insisted upon" the
importance of material bodies and environments, the authors remain
"\[concerned\] that such material dimensions have recently been
marginalized by fashionable constructivist approaches and identity
politics" (p. 19). The latter, they continue, "had a good deal to say
about the body and its imbrication in relationships of power, but we are
not convinced that they pay sufficient attention to the material
efficacy of bodies or have the theoretical resources to do so" (ibid.).
Such a statement is heavy with longstanding racial charges of
intellectual primitivism and parochialism. The unfortunate request to be
"convinced" of identity politics' intellectual merit effectively seals
an historically white critical theory as the standard for authoritative
knowledge production.11 One must also wonder about the referents for
these insufficiently materialist identity politics, given that the New
Materialisms anthology fails to cite even one example that might be
taken as representative of a larger trend. Even if Coole and Frost
employ "identity politics" as a shorthand for idealist approaches to
subjectivity, their statement betrays both a misunderstanding of studies
of "identity," and a symptomatic desire to abandon race. To be clear,
Coole and Frost never openly reduce "identity politics" to racial
identity. But in many if not most of new materialisms' founding texts,
race receives only casual mention alongside the "other socalled axes of
social difference" like sex, gender, and class, and often to specify a
concept that has been "paralyzed by \[a\] 'binary' take on dualism"
(Dolphijn & van der Tuin, 2012, p. 88, 143), or to name potential
beneficiaries of one's theorization (Barad, 2007; Grosz, 2004). We could
perhaps attribute this treatment of race to an obdurate politics of
attention (Ahmed, 2008) that determines which issues receive
consideration.12 Nonetheless, to ascertain if and how the new
materialisms might furnish us with a timelier ethics, we must first ask
what purpose the omission of race serves. The Movement for Black Lives
has forcefully reminded us that black bodies have historically provided
the standards against which the human subject and non-human objects are
measured. This is to say that the "rupture in the quality of being"
inaugurated by modern racial slavery is not limited to black lives
(Brand, 2001, p. 29). Black critical theorists repeatedly insist on the
world-historical scale of this rupture, tracking how it conditions our
thinking about humans and matter, and the movements of this thought
itself. What this means for our current discussion is that "the question
of race's reality has and continues to bear directly on hierarchies of
knowledge pertaining to the nature of reality itself" (Jackson, 2015, p.
216), or on what Dionne Brand (2001) calls our "cognitive schema" (p.
29). As a conceptual orientation or method of "way-finding," the
prevailing cognitive schema articulates **[a libidinal economy of
antiblackness]{.underline}** to the history of ideas, ensuring, as
Spillers (2003) [maintains]{.underline}, [that]{.underline} "**[dominant
symbolic activity]{.underline}**, the ruling episteme [that releases the
dynamics of]{.underline} naming and [valuation]{.underline}, [remains
grounded in the originating metaphors of captivity and
mutilation]{.underline};" "**[sticks and bricks might break our
bones]{.underline}**, **[but words will]{.underline}** **[most certainly
kill us]{.underline}**" (pp. 208-209). By inverting a childhood
rejoinder about the supposedly limited reach of the symbolic, Spillers
lays out a provocative proposal: the metaphors of slavery are immanent
to the force of the material. Although "'race' alone bears no inherent
meaning, even though it reifies in personality," it "gains its power
from what it signifies by point, in what it allows to come to meaning"
(Spillers, 2003, p. 380). Black lives matter, and blackness enlivens
matter. It is possible, then, that the elaboration of thought, the
conditions of its enunciation and reception, are always part of a racial
praxis, even when those "personalities" that absorb the reification of
race are most absent. This is a paradigmatic example of the prevailing
cognitive schema at work. Antiblackness conditions the force of
materiality by determining the logic of both its actualization and its
theoretical manifestations. These functions become clearer when we turn
our attention to Octavia Butler's Parable duology.

#### The plan demands the "durable fiat" of an [ahistorical dream]{.underline} -- anti-ethics is your [paradigmatic]{.underline} imperative

The Fiat of Dreams: The potentiality of whiteness---the proleptic call
of white anti-racist consciousness--- is nothing more than [the **fiat
of an ahistorical dream**]{.underline}. A command ushered before thought
[engages]{.underline} racism, **[before awareness]{.underline}** of the
world becomes aware **[of what is actual]{.underline}**. This is forced
upon accounts of racism where whiteness is morally obscured from being
seen as is. \[w\]hiteness as is partly determined by what could be,
since what is was a past potentiality---a could be. The [appeal
to]{.underline} the [**sentimentality**,]{.underline} morality,
[the]{.underline} moral abstraction/**[distraction of
equality]{.underline}**---both [as a **political command** and its
**anthropological requisite**]{.underline}---[complicate]{.underline}
the most obvious consequence of [anti-Black]{.underline} racism, namely
[violence]{.underline}. This **[moral apriorism]{.underline}** [urges
the Black thinker to conceptualize racism as an **activist project**
rooted in the potential of a world filled with non-racists, a world
where the white racist is transformed by Black activity into the white
anti-racist]{.underline}. [But this]{.underline} project supposes an
erroneous view of the white racist which **[occludes the
reality]{.underline}** [of white supremacy]{.underline} and anti-Black
racism. As Robert F. Williams argues in Negroes with Guns, "the racist
is a man crazed by hysteria at the idea of coming into equal contact
with Negroes. And this mass mental illness called racism is very much a
part of the 'American way of Life.'" The white racist is not seen as the
delusional individual ostracized from society as a result of their
abhorrent social pathologies of racist hate. Rather the white racist is
normal---the extended family, the spouse, the sibling, the friend of the
white individual---the very same entities upon which the
inter/intrasubjectivity nexus of the white self is founded. The white
\[he\] experiences no punishment for his longing for Black servitude and
his need to exploit and divest the Black worker here and then of \[his\]
wealth. The white \[she\] has no uneasiness about her raping of---the
destruction of generations of Black selves---mothers, children, and
men---and today usurps the historical imagery of "the nigger," to
politically vacate Blackness and demonize niggers as beyond political
consideration. She rewrites history, pens morality, and embodies [the
post-]{.underline}racial [civil rights subject]{.underline}. As such,
racism, the milieu of the white racist [is **not**]{.underline} [the
exposed pathological existence]{.underline} of the white race,
[but]{.underline} rather [valorized in]{.underline} **[white
individuality]{.underline}**, the individuality that conceptualizes
their racism as a normative aspiration of what the world should look
like, and even more damning, an aspiration that can be supported and
propagated in the world. The white racist recognizes the deliberateness
of the structures, relations, and systems in a white supremacist society
and seeks like their colonial foreparents to claim them as their own.
**[The Anti-Ethical as Paradigmatic Imperative]{.underline}**:
[Traditionally we have taken ethics to be]{.underline}, as Henry
Sidgwick's claims, \"[any rational procedure by which we determine what
individual human beings \'ought\']{.underline}---or what is right for
them---[or to seek to realize by voluntary action]{.underline}."
[This]{.underline} rational [procedure is]{.underline} however **[at
odds with the empirical reality the ethical deliberation must concern
itself with]{.underline}**. **[To argue]{.underline}**, as is often
done, that **[the government]{.underline}**, its citizens, or white
people **[should act justly]{.underline}**, **[assumes that the
possibility of how they could act defines their moral
disposition]{.underline}**. [If a white person could **possibly not be
racist**]{.underline}, it [does **not** mean]{.underline} that the
possibility of not being racist, can be taken to mean that [they are not
racist]{.underline}. [In ethical deliberations]{.underline} dealing with
the problem of racism, [it is common practice to attribute to
historically racist institutions]{.underline}, and individuals universal
[moral qualities that have **yet to be demonstrated**]{.underline}.
[This **abstraction from reality** is what frames our ethical norms and
allows us to maintain, despite history or evidence, that racist entities
will act justly given the choice]{.underline}. [Under such complexities,
**the only ethical deliberation concerning racism must be
anti-ethical**, or a judgment refusing to write morality onto immoral
entities]{.underline}. In the post-structuralist era, post-colonial
thinking about racism specifically, and difference/otherness generally,
has given a peculiar ameliorative function to discourse and the
performance of "other-ed" identities. In this era, the dominant illusion
is that discourse itself , an act that requires as its basis the
recognition of the "other" as "similar," is socially
transformative---not only with regard to how the white subject
assimilates the similitude of the "other-ed," but as an actual activity
gauged by the recognition by one white person or by a group of white
people in any given scenario, is uncritically accepted and encouraged as
anti-racist politics.. In actuality such discourse appeals, which
necessitate---become dependent on---(white) recognition, function very
much like the racial stereotype, in that the concept of the Black body
being the expression and source of experience and phenomena
(existential-phenomenological-theorization) is incarcerated by the
conceptualization created the discursive catalyst yearning to be
perceived by the white thing seeing the Black. **[Such appeals lend
potentiality-hope-faith]{.underline}** to the already
present/demonstrated ignorance-racism-interest of the white individual,
who in large part expresses the historical tone/epistemology of their
racial group's interest. When morality is defined, not by the empirical
acts that demonstrate immorality, but the racial character of those in
question, [our ethics become **nothing more**]{.underline}
[than]{.underline} the [apologetics]{.underline} of our tyrannical
epoch. **[Ought implies a projected (futural) act]{.underline}**. [The
word **commands a deliberate action**]{.underline} to reasonably expect
the world to be able to sustain or support. [For the Black]{.underline}
thinker, the Black citizen-subject-[slave]{.underline}-(in)human, [ought
is **not rational** but **repressive**]{.underline}. For the oppressed
racialized thinker, the [ethical provocation is a]{.underline}n
immediate **[confrontation with the impossibility of actually
acting]{.underline}** [towards values like freedom, liberty, humanity,
and life]{.underline}, [since none of these]{.underline} values [can be
achieved]{.underline} concretely [for the Black in a world]{.underline}
controlled by and [framed by the white]{.underline}. The options for
ethical actions are not ethical in and of themselves, but merely the
options the immorality of the racist world will allow, thus [the
oppressed is forced to **idealize**]{.underline} [their]{.underline}
ethical [positions]{.underline}, eliminating the truth of their reality,
and the peeling away the tyranny of white bodies, so that as the
oppressed, the can ideally imagine an "if condition," whereby they are
allowed to ethical engage racism from the perspective of: "if whites
were moral and respected the humanity of Blacks, then we can ethically
engage in these behaviors. Unfortunately, [this ought
constraint]{.underline} only [forces Blacks to consciously recognize the
futility of ethical engagement]{.underline}, since [it is in this
**ought** deliberation that they recognize that their **cognition** of
all values are dependent not on their moral aspirations for the
world]{.underline}, but the determined by the will of white supremacy to
maintain virtue throughout all ethical calculations. In short, [Black
ethical deliberation is **censored** so]{.underline} that [it can
**only** engage]{.underline} moral [questions by asserting]{.underline}
that [whites are]{.underline} virtuous and hence [capable of
being]{.underline} ethically **[persuaded]{.underline}** [towards right
action]{.underline}, hence all ethical question about racism, white
supremacy and anti-Blackness is not about how Blacks think about the
world, but what possibility the world allows Blacks to contemplate under
the idea of ethics. These ethics, the ethics that result from this
vitiated morality, are not arbiters of oppression at all. They are not a
rational calculus that is capable of revealing a categorical imperative,
rather they function as the Kantian constraints upon human experience;
the synthetic apriori upon which the phenomena of whiteness is the
landscape of thinking about Blackness under the Western anthropos. There
is an implicit appeal to a hierarchy of being that is both empirical and
universal---all man is superior to non-man. Hence, ethics emerges as the
product of the overrepresentation of Western man thinking
itself---projecting itself---into the future. These
[ethics]{.underline}, theorized away from the anti-Blackness not within
it, only uphold an **[overdetermine]{.underline}**d virtue of
[whiteness]{.underline}. [They hold]{.underline} within them no actual
delineation between good or bad, only [a **Puritanical
call**]{.underline} to reason [to turn]{.underline} its attention
[to]{.underline}wards [the other]{.underline}-ed created.
[This]{.underline} attention however [relies on]{.underline} the
[perceptions]{.underline} and caricatures [of Black torment]{.underline}
[that appeal to]{.underline} the [whites' self-assuring
imagining]{.underline} of themselves, [so]{.underline} that even **[when
confronted with racism and their role]{.underline}** as whites thinking
about Black people incarcerated within a racist society and dying, these
[whites can claim]{.underline} that their [conceptualization of
racism]{.underline} itself, or (**[inter-sectionally]{.underline}**)
[next to other injustices like poverty, sexism, **homophobia,
etc**]{.underline}. [makes them]{.underline} (whites)
[virtuous]{.underline}. It is the process of, the appeal to, "getting
whites to recognize" (racist) oppression [that allows]{.underline} the
destruction of reality, [Black death]{.underline}, [to continue
unabated]{.underline}, since it is the exact moment that whites are
forced to engage racist problems in America, be it the anti-Black
violence of American society, which animates the aversion of the justice
system, the police state, the white citizenry, or the practice of
American democracy itself---where the death of Black
people/criminals/deviants/thugs remain normal and justified by
whites---that they, the white(s) thinking about racism, get to impose
upon Black reality, a racist moral maxim, namely that racism is not
death and beyond --the end of\--ethical calculus or moral evaluation,
but ultimately contingent in America and of measurable consequence so
much so that must be weighed next to the other democratic values that
preserve this great white society: security, safety, individuality,
property, profit, and freedom, the very values that when enacted by
whites continue to perpetuate one ultimate end, the death of Blacks.
Racism is not unethical simply because it is a moral affront to the
allegedly generalizable Western/white/enlightenment notion of humanity
extended to Blacks by the liberal synonymy of citizenship. Racism is
unethical, immoral, because it re-presents---makes known in the
present--- and acts to capture the Blacks urging the acknowledgment of
racism in the ontological entity of modernity's greatest
oppression---the slave; the non-human. To say [racism is]{.underline}
unethical is to say that it is [outside of]{.underline} ethical
deliberation, which is to say what is meant by [ethics meant
to]{.underline} rationally [determine relationships between **human
beings**]{.underline}. Because racism exposes the absurdity of Western
ontology's suggestion that the white/European human stands in moral
obligation towards the non-human/Black/racialized other created by the
Western notion of MAN, calling for "[ethical deliberation]{.underline}"
is a call to [make]{.underline} the historical event of **[Black
inhumanity]{.underline}** introduced by modernity [the referent of white
rationalizations]{.underline} about Black death, and anti-Blackness.
Such deliberation only offers the white mind the opportunity to reassert
the social boundaries constraining Black life conceptually. It is the
memory of slavery, which motivates the white's attachment to the
contingency of Black life, and ultimately concludes that racism, while
unfortunate, is/was necessary for America/the West, the world to exist
and humanity/the citizen to reach its historical/imperial apex. Thus,
MAN, [the onto-**anthropological basis of humanity** and]{.underline}
the cultural [values]{.underline} that are simultaneously birthed to
project humanity into existence [is the **origin** of]{.underline} the
[oppressive conceptualizations]{.underline} of the other. Oppression "as
is" was born out of and sustained by the exclusive morality of
white/Western humanity against [the barbarism imposed on the
Black]{.underline}/African. As such, the nigger born of racism is behind
all oppressions, since "it" [is]{.underline} the
cultural/epistemological/historical ethic---[the]{.underline} moral
**[rock bottom]{.underline}** [of dehumanization]{.underline}. The
oppressed is made nigger through dehumanization; the product of absolute
debasement, while morality/virtue the valuations of ethics itself is
reified perpetually by the activity of whiteness; its perpetual
commanding of morality to conform to and justify their existence as the
human. As Karen Gange writes in "On the Obsolesce of Disciplines"
(2007), The shift out of our present conception of Man, out of our
present "World System"---the one that places people of African descent
and the ever-expanding global, transracial category of the homeless,
jobless, and criminalized damned as the zero-most factor of Other to
Western Man's Self---has to be first and foremost a cultural shift, not
an economic one. [Until]{.underline} such [a rupture]{.underline} in our
conception [of]{.underline} being [human is brought forth]{.underline},
such **["sociological" concerns]{.underline}** as that [of]{.underline}
the vast [global]{.underline} and local [economic
inequalities]{.underline}, [immigration]{.underline}, **[labor
policies]{.underline}**, struggles about race, [gender]{.underline},
class, and [ethnicity]{.underline}, and struggles over [the
environment]{.underline}, global warming, and **[distribution of world
resources]{.underline}**, [will remain status quo]{.underline}.
**[Anti-ethics]{.underline}**; the call to [demystify]{.underline} the
present concept of [man as illusion]{.underline}, as delusion,
[and]{.underline} as **[stratagem]{.underline}**, is the axiomatic
rupture of white existence and the multiple global oppressions like
capitalism, militarism, genocide, and globalization, that formed the
evaluative nexus which allows whites to claim they are the civilized
guardians of the world's darker races. [It is the rejection of white
virtue]{.underline}, the white's axiomatic claim to humanity that allows
the Black, the darker world [to sow]{.underline} the seeds of
[consciousness towards liberation]{.underline} from oppression.
[When]{.underline} white [(in)humanity is no longer an obstacle weighed
against]{.underline} the means for [liberation]{.underline} from racism,
[the oppressed are free to overthrow]{.underline} the [principles that
suggest their paths]{.underline} to liberation [are]{.underline} immoral
and hence [not possible]{.underline}. To accept the oppressor as is, the
white made manifest in empire, is to transform white western (hu)man
from semi-deitous sovereign citizen to contingent, mortal, and
un-otherable. Exposing the inhumanity of white humanity is the
destruction/refusal of the disciplinary imperative for liberal reformism
and dialogue as well as a rejection of the social conventions that
dictate speaking as if this white person, the white person and her white
people before you are in fact not racist white people, but
tolerable---not like the racist white people abstracted from reality,
but really spoken of in conversations about racism. The revelatory call,
the coercively silenced but intuitive yearning o describe the actual
reality set before Black people in an anti-Black society, is to simply
say **[there is no negotiating the boundaries of
anti-Blackness]{.underline}** or the horizons of white supremacy.
Racism, the debasement of melaninated bodies and nigger-souls, is
totalizing.

#### The alt is Black [redaction]{.underline} and [annotation]{.underline} of the 1AC -- key to defending the dead 

**Murillo 16** (Dr. John Murillo III is a graduate of Brown University
with a PhD in English. His primary research interests include twentieth
century black literature, afro-pessimism, critical theory, quantum
mechanics, astrophysics, and cosmology. Review of "In the Wake: On
Blackness and Being". 10-4-16. <http://makemag.com/in-the-wake/>
//shree)

Imperative for Sharpe, and for all of we who inhabit the wake of
enslavement, is an ensemble of questions aimed at the work of Black
being---questions Frank B. Wilderson III might describe as "menacing and
unbearable:" "**[What does it mean to defend the dead?]{.underline}**
[To tend to the Black dead and dying: to tend to the Black person, to
Black people, always living in the push toward death?"]{.underline}
Further, what might emerge should we-in-the-wake really harness "the
power of sitting with someone as they die," and really, devotionally be
about "the important work of sitting (together) in the pain and sorrow
of death as a way of marking, remembering...celebrating" and "\[trying\]
to really see" Black life, "if only momentarily?" [Against the
"dysgraphia" and misnaming that subject Black being to every order of
disaster, Sharpe works to "find the language for this work...to find the
words that will articulate care]{.underline}...\[[and\] to sound a new
language," to consider "how to perform the labor" of those words and
that language.]{.underline} Chapter by chapter she proceeds, carefully
working to examine the space and time of Black subjection in the
antiblack world, [while]{.underline} also [taking care to
"insist"---]{.underline}a verb Sharpe returns to repeatedly---[upon
real, fleeting and/or fractured glimpses of Black life scattered
throughout the violence of the archive]{.underline}. Be that deathly
life on or as "The Ship," (Chapter 2), life as "boat people," which is
life marked by the figure of the slave ship---itself like the photograph
of the young Haitian girl with "ship" mysteriously, menacingly, taped to
her forehead (Sharpe returns to this girl and her image throughout the
text). Or, be it in "The Hold" of the ship (Chapter 3), known by all its
attendant conditions and resonant images, which continues to
hold---bind, contain, strangle---us, the very same hold which we (are
made to) hold within, in the flesh. Or, be it in the gasping for air
against the reality of the "disaster" that is "The Weather" and the
water (Chapter 4) that is antiblackness. In every iteration of the space
and time of Black life and death, life/death, Sharpe locates a moment,
glimpse, or fragment that insists Black life/death through the wake.For
Sharpe, this is deathly Black life, and these are its words and doings.
[Black life is]{.underline} "[anagrammatical]{.underline}."
"Anagrammatical blackness...exists," as she puts it, "[as an index of
violability **and potentiality**]{.underline}." [This is]{.underline} a
[Blackness]{.underline} betwixt and between, [caught in the]{.underline}
opening/rift/[tear marked by this index]{.underline}---"blackness anew,
[blackness as]{.underline} a/temporal, [in and out of place and
time]{.underline} putting pressure on meaning [and that against which
meaning is made]{.underline}." [This is a Black
betwixt]{.underline}/betweenness. This betwixt/between region, like the
asterisk in Trans\*, [holds open]{.underline} a space/time in [the
imagination for]{.underline} "**[new modes of writing]{.underline}**,
new modes of making-sensible" with/against the orthographies of the
wake, an alternative set of reading and writing practices [that carry
out **wake work**,]{.underline} what Christina Sharpe calls "**[Black
annotation and]{.underline}** Black **[redaction]{.underline}**."
Perhaps most essentially, in relation to the dead, the dying, and "those
living lives consigned to the possibility of always-imminent death, life
lived in the presence of death," [Black life---**in blips and bits**,
silences and looks---insists upon a different kind of holding, an
**alternative kind of care**, and a violent and **lifesaving** kind of
aspiration---aspiration, in Sharpe's use, being the process of "keeping
and putting breath back into the Black body" as we approach "the
histories and presents" of Black life and death in the wake. To be, to
think, and to move with In the Wake is to meet the look of this
insistence **unflinchingly**, to linger in that look and to look
carefully, with care, and to claim, to accompany, and to hold those
dead, dying, and living in death's proximity in our memory, our thought,
and our imagination, through, and as our very consciousness. Without and
**against the desire to fantasize a Black** humanity and **subjectivity
that fills in the silences, the breaks, the lapses and absences in the
archive**, In the Wake, and the wake work it practices and theorizes,
insists on a reimagining of the way we locate, hold, carry, and, again,
really try to see Black life as it is lived bound up with
death]{.underline}---[as it creates, thinks, and moves with, through,
and against storming, disastrous antiblackness]{.underline}. What
precedes is a circumstantial account. I am unable to capture in this
limited space the complexity and beauty of the maneuvers Christina
Sharpe makes as she sits with, drifts with, and never abandons, the many
Black lives and deaths that give In the Wake, its theorization, and its
practices their force; even less am I able to wholly account for the
fullness of the "new language...new modes of writing, \[and\] new modes
of making-sensible" she painstakingly develops, applies, and reexamines
in her work. This is, after all, only a sounding of a small note of care
and careful critique for an extraordinary work. Instead, I will conclude
with Sharpe's own summation of the mission of the text, its theorization
of the wake, of its wake work and ours, of the past and ongoing works it
holds tightly, and of the work it has inspired and is bound to inspire.
At the end of the first chapter, "The Wake," she writes: [I want In the
Wake to declare that we are Black peoples in the wake with no state or
nation to protect us, with no citizenship bound to be respected, and to
position us in the modalities of Black life lived in, as, under, despite
Black death: to think and be and act from there. It is my particular
hope that the praxis of the wake and wake work, the theory and
performance of the wake and wake work, as modes of attending to Black
life and Black suffering, are imagined and performed here with enough
specificity to attend to the direness of the multiple]{.underline} and
overlapping [presents that we face; it is also my hope that the praxis
of the wake and wake work might have enough capaciousness to travel and
do work that I have not here been able to imagine or anticipate. To echo
Fanon]{.underline}, perhaps, here, in the wake, and [from In the
Wake]{.underline}, and with all the work it holds close, sits with, and
aspires/inspires, "[might an authentic upheaval be born]{.underline}"
(Black Skin White Masks). With In the Wake, Christina Sharpe looks out
from the text and really tries to see us, both those here and gone,
living and dead, in the wake, for all we are. We might begin, anew, by
carefully looking back---double emphasis on care.

# Framework:

#### Our interpretation is that debate should be about competing theoretical and political imaginaries

#### Prefer it -- 

#### --Subject formation -- advantage choice controls topic education \-- doesn't preclude good clash, this is in depth \-- topic research \-- perfectly predictable 

#### reflection-- plan-based debate makes critical thought impossible because we never learn the critical thinking skills we are supposed to get from debate 

#### the impact is education \-- not a question of fairness but education, switch side doesn't solve, resolving the underlying anti-black assumptions of the debate space easily o/w them not being able to "read/win" on a DA 

#### their FW offense is a new link- an ideological hegemony that filters what elements of the plan should be the stasis of conversation that allows problematic performances to go unabated. 

#### ROB is to endorse advocacies not actions -- reject the dogma of ideological heg -- it's the foundation of anti-black sentiments

and the chair of the Division of Communications at Miles College, earned
the doctorate at Indiana University, 5-25-2022, \"Ideological Hegemony:
A Precursor to Institutional Racism,\" AAIHS,
https://www.aaihs.org/ideological-hegemony-a-precursor-to-institutional-racism///vi

Intellectuals advanced the concept of ideological hegemony, which is
applicable to the establishment and change of relationships between
Caucasians and African Americans. Marxist theorists Antonio Gramsci,
Stuart Hall, Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, and others expounded in
regards to ideological hegemony, the ideas and structures wherein
individuals without access to power reinforce instruments of action of
the powerful despite their potentially harmful and silencing effects.
Marxism analyzes the relationship between the powerful and the
powerless. The writings of Karl Marx, a German sociologist, historian,
and economist, who published in 1848 with Friedrich Engles the Communist
Manifesto, heavily influenced the intellectuals. The celebrated
Manifesto pamphlet concluded that the creation of a society with one
class of people would end problems between the haves and have nots.
Hall, the Jamaican-born British Marxist sociologist, cultural theorist,
and political activist articulated his view of ideology. The concept is
more than a belief system or a way of thinking. Ideology is an
actionable principle enabling the organization of political or economic
functions in a society or a sector of a populace. Ideology aims to
create public annunciation of policies for the realization of a set of
beliefs. Communism, capitalism, liberalism, conservatism, nationalism,
and multiculturalism are examples of ideologies. During the modern Civil
Rights Movement, academics and activists recognized Hall as one of the
first scholars to articulate the ideology of multiculturalism, which
represents the development and organization of institutions and
societies that include on an equal basis African Americans and their
culture in white-dominated societies. Multiculturalism included other
ethnicities and people of color. Ideology is relevant because the
concept significantly explains the materialization and perpetuation of
white supremacy. The ideas of white supremacy diffuse from powerful
individuals and settle upon subordinates. [The theory of white supremacy
began with imperial, national, or **intellectual** leadership and
**percolated** down to the masses. In the United States, the framing of
ideology applicable to race relations originated at the top of the
political structure and diffused to the bottom social realms of the
population. The writers of the U.S. Constitution codified Black
inferiority during the mid-1770s to late 1780s]{.underline}. Instead of
legislation requiring states to take the census of 100 percent of the
Black population, Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution
authorized states to count enslaved people as representing only
three-fifths of the total Black population. [Other early constitutional
provisions were also **racist**. Congress prohibited states from
outlawing the trade of enslaved Africans, required white people to
return the captured escaped-enslaved to their masters, and embedded the
federal government with the power to suppress insurrections by the
enslaved. State legislatures and federal courts **undergirded white
supremacy** with the enactment or support of racist laws, such as the
separation of Blacks and whites in public spaces. White supremacists
committed murder, physical violence, rape, political oppression, and
psychological abuse against Black people. As racial integration began to
emerge, **anti-Blackness gradually became less overt**, but African
Americans were denied favorable treatment and access to decision-making
positions. The theory of ideological hegemony materializes when a
populous takes part in **reinforcing** power structures and societal
ideas willingly, even when the structures and ideas only marginally
benefit those without meaningful access to power. **Social groups
embrace ideological heg**emony despite its capability to harm or silence
dissent.]{.underline} Gramsci wrote in one of the sections of the
Notebooks that [the government is responsible of hegemony. "...to gain
the upper hand, to propagate itself throughout society... and thus
**creating the hegemony of a fundamental social group over a series of
subordinate groups**..... It is true that the State is seen as the organ
of one particular group, destined to create favourable conditions for
the latter's maximum expansion..."1 In colonial America, the political
and military elite established dominant domestic power and held onto it
in part by convincing the masses to accept their versions of reality,
among which were proclamations of an exploitative British monarch,
victimized colonists, superior white men, and inferior people of color.
The ideologies disseminated in written form but mostly **orally** and
consistently. Over time, white people and Black people interpreted the
ideas of race relations as commonplace. By then coercion of the white
masses was unnecessary.]{.underline} Authorities used intimidation and
force against Black people to accept white supremacy. [The elite
continuously encouraged the ideology of the superiority of white people
and their culture and the inferiority of people of color and their ways
of life]{.underline}. Hall said the government is not always the reason
the public adopts certain belief structures. Ideological hegemony often
originates with the elite private sector. ["It is quite easy to see why
the only ideology that gets **reproduced is the dominant one.** But the
far more pertinent, but difficult, question is how a society allows the
relative freedom of civil institutions to operate in the ideological
field, day after day, without direction or compulsion by the
State.]{.underline}"2 When assessing the validity of a claim, the
enlightened might say that a scholar's intellectual viewpoint should be
considered separately from his or her personal beliefs. [Intellectualism
includes well **thought out propositions**, sometimes based on the
results of an]{.underline} analysis of empirical data. To the contrary,
[beliefs are **rooted in cultural practices** that are personal, deeply
felt, and sometimes unprovable.]{.underline} Gramsci's views on the
distribution of power and influence changed the formulation of a wave of
scholarship concerning ideological hegemony that evolved between the
1850s to the 1960s. Gramsci proposed [that the ideas of the powerful are
diffused and maintained among groups who are oppressed or otherwise
powerless**.** Ideological hegemony is also applicable to race relations
in the late 1960s and early 1970s during which racial integration began
to occur in American institutions.]{.underline} With that said, one
might argue that Gramsci's personal viewpoint on Black people too should
be separated from his intellectual analysis. Gramsci's Eurocentrism
contained some of the same negative views of Africans and African
Americans as the segregationists in the south.3 Gramsci's writing
included his personal expression of ideological hegemony applicable to
the relationships between powerful white men and the formally enslaved
African Americans whose lineage Gramsci suggests was backward. One
further phenomenon in the United States is worth studying, and that is
the formation of a surprising number of negro intellectuals who absorb
American culture and technology. It is worth bearing in mind the
indirect influence that these negro intellectuals could exercise on the
backward masses in Africa, and indeed direct influence if one or another
of these hypotheses were ever to be verified: 1. that American
expansionism should use American negroes as its agents in the conquest
of the African market and the extension of American civilization.4
Gramsci's position on the then-modern relationship whites foisted on
Blacks coincides with the views of critics of race relations in the
United States. Gramsci also wrote that powerful white Americans reserved
decision-making authority for Caucasians, who limited the progression of
Black people. "It seems to me that, for the moment, American negroes
have a national and racial spirit which is negative rather than
positive, one which is a product of the struggle carried on by the
whites in order to isolate and depress them."5 Gramsci also wrote of his
interpretation that Africans, Black people in the United States by
extension, that they were devoid of intellect. He said Africans lived in
a state of ignorance that Europeans discovered upon their first
encounters with them on the African continent. "One got the impression
that it was all rather like the first contacts of English merchants and
the negroes of Africa: trashy baubles were handed out in exchange for
nuggets of gold."6 In other words, Gramsci suggests that African
Americans, the decedents of ignorant Africans, existed devoid of
intellectual prowess. Therefore, Caucasians were justified with
excluding Black people from realms wherein white people practiced
ideological hegemony: the superior Caucasians and inferior Black
people[. The **concept of racism** employed the same mechanism as
**ideological hegemony** wherein the purveyors of dominant idealistic
power transferred racists ideas from the upper-class to the
lower-classes. At the level of the upper class, systemic racism
represents a series of actions of interacting mechanisms wherein white
leadership made available opportunities exclusive of Black
people]{.underline}. Institutional racism, on the other hand, refers to
leaders of organizations or operations that distribute opportunities and
services inequitably based on race. Institutional racism is the
mechanism by which systemic racism functions. Education, healthcare,
financing, and justice are among the institutions providing societal
resources that Caucasians reserved for white people. [The concept of
ideological hegemony preceded that of racism, but it laid the foundation
on **which racism rested** and explains why white leaders drastically
delayed opening institutions to Black people to work at professional
functions.]{.underline}

As an ontology, [antiblackness is inseparable from
knowledge]{.underline} of and thus the experience of being, a living
being, a human species being. [Ontologies are about nature]{.underline}.
They are always bio-ontologies. As Elizabeth Povinelli explains,
[ontological claims are inseparable from the emergence of biology as a
discipline (2016).]{.underline} The prolific Jamaican anti-colonial
philosopher and novelist Sylvia Wynter has been a seminal figure in
linking the intellectual invention of the human as a universal abstract
category, human nature, to an antiblack ontology. Engagement with and
the growing relevance of Wynter's work (1995, 2003) has only skyrocketed
since its initial reception. In the 90's and at the turn of the century
Wynter's work developed the argument that the experience of being human
is shaped by the internalization of social scripts on the (human) Self
and (human) Other. Wynter teases out two versions of the human. She maps
the second version, Man2, onto 20th century ideas of the human as
genetically selected versus dysselected life. Whereas she maps the first
version, Man1, onto 15th century ideas of the human as rational and
political versus an irrational and sensual animal. In this process,
[divine causality was displaced by the laws of nature.]{.underline}
According to Wynter, prior to these European inventions of Man as a
species, the human didn't exist as such, but [rather European
subjectivity linked the individual body to the divine procreator through
idealized Christian figures of the clergy and nobility.]{.underline}
Rather than read Man1 as the version of the human that is separate from
nature and Man2 as the version of the human that is the same as nature,
Wynter reads the emergence of the human (first with Man1 and then Man2)
as the trajectory of becoming increasingly closer to nature, i.e., as a
natural object---a species. This is important because it highlights how
[becoming natural is constitutive of becoming human]{.underline} or in
other words actualizing the human self as a distinct species
consciousness is cultivated through increasing intimacy with nature. The
link to the microbiome is clear: Man3, the posthuman, is even closer to
nature. [Microbial diversity levels and variations in composition become
the new biomarker for differentiating the (post)human]{.underline}. Man3
even grounds distinctions in consciousness in the natural agency of the
world. Fitness reflects a psychic intimacy with nature, which is figured
as the awareness of being microbial ecologies all the way down.
Critically the emergence of Man 1 and Man 2, not only rescript
Eurocentric cosmologies of difference---rooted in the distinction
between good and evil---in ontological or 'natural' terms but do so
through the invention of the African. As such English scholar Zakiyyah
Iman Jackson in her book Becoming Human: Matter and Meaning in an
Antiblack World follows how blackness in the form of the African, for
Wynter, is not "excluded from the category of Man and its
overrepresentation of humanity but foundational to it as its antipodal
figure, as the nadir of Man" (Jackson, 2020: 19--20). For Wynter, this
antiblack dichotomy is not a binary but an expanding continuum. In other
words, [the capacious categories of human Others
proliferate]{.underline} not just out of race but [out of the "central
and primary representation of the black physiognomy" as "proof" of
biogenetic nonhomogeneity and thus as the "ultimate mode of
otherness]{.underline}" (Wynter, 1995: 42). For Wynter the emergence of
the natural sciences and the notion of life, species, populations,
selection processes, etc. embeds antiblack notions of good versus evil
into the nature of life and death, improvement and degeneration.
Therefore, as scholarship rescripts the human Self, we need to attend to
the relation between posing the microbe as the Other that remakes the
Human Self, and way blackness has been historically figured as the
ultimate Other of the Human. Central to Wynter's critique of biocentric
notions of the Human is that paradoxically recourse to nature's agency
hides these specific yet collective scripts through which we inscribe
our sense of self, other, and world. Ontological scripts written by the
natural sciences are peculiar because the author of the claim is
scripting themselves as a living being too. For Wynter, Enlightenment
[epistemological shifts about humans, nature, and life are shifts in the
politics of being]{.underline} (Wynter, 2003). Wynter's elaboration of
antiblack ontology places emphasis on the relation between scripts about
what it is like to be a certain life form and the experience of being
such life form. That is, integral to her treatment of antiblackness as
ontology is for/by whom is this account of existence experienced and
thus how does it differentially materialize modes of consciousness. For
Wynter antiblackness is a historically specific episteme that has become
ontologized, not the truth but an adapted truth for the experience of
being white. In turn, she reconceptualizes the relation between
epistemology and ontology as sociogeny. In other words, antiblackness is
a historically specific sociogeny. [Antiblackness has become
ontologized]{.underline} not only [because of the way it is modeled on
nature or biology]{.underline} but also [because of the way it is
ontologically adaptive for those Europeans making claims about good/evil
in terms of the natural order of the world.]{.underline} In turn, it is
adaptive for the invented experience of being white because the
neurochemical pleasure derived in affirmations of the self is what
naturalizes the European cum white experience of self as normal. In
other words, it is by activating the reward and punishment mechanisms of
the nervous system that cultural scripts about the "genetic-instinctual
sense of self" reaches down into the psyche's processes of "perception
and categorization" (Jackson, 2020 on Wynter). In this way, [ideas about
the microbe today are posed as both an intellectual revolution and a
revolution in the politics of being.]{.underline} Moreover, [microbes
are presented as a new way of thinking about the pleasure-pain relation
and the reward-punishment system.]{.underline} In so doing, microbes not
only link the symbolic social milieu to biochemical processes of health
and disease but as such [internalization of the social
script]{.underline}---on being microbial---becomes an adaptive response
itself. This points to the limits of Wynter, as [sociogeny itself
becomes ontologized]{.underline}. The stakes are high. For Wynter, the
ontologization of antiblackness not only naturalizes the white
experience as adaptive but also ontologizes the experience of blackness
as the nonadaptive experience of "dysbeing: symbolic death as out of
place with respect to being human" (McKittrick, 2015: 60). Since the
only true human self is the white self, the "lived experience of being
black" becomes doubled as not just Other (as object) but also as Self
(as the subjective experience of being objectified) (Wynter, 2001).
Elaborating on both Dubois' and Fanon's concept of "double
consciousness," Wynter explains how this nonadaptive experience of
blackness takes form as either an "aberration in affect" in the form of
auto-phobia or the "mimetic desire and adoption of white masks" as the
"attempt by black subjects to realize themselves/ourselves in
non-aversive terms as truly human" (Wynter, 2001: 53). In deciphering
the narratively prescribed master code that institutes particular social
orders and thus conjures forms of life into existence, Wynter argues
Fanon's [practice of sociodiagnostics]{.underline} not only ["enabled
the calling in question of our present culture's purely biological
definition of what it is to be,]{.underline} and therefore of [what it
is like to be, human"]{.underline} [but in so doing provided "insights
into the laws which govern the realm of lived subjective experience,
human and non-human, which govern, therefore, the interrelated
phenomenon of identity, mind, and/or consciousness"]{.underline}
(Wynter, 2001: 31-32). In turn, for Wynter[, it is only from this
"context of systemic misrepresentation" that the psycho-affective space
of blackness re/scripts life at the ontological level]{.underline}
(Wynter, 1995: 44).

#### Don't let them weigh their offense- cybersecurity is NOT existential, and cyber attacks rarely escalate to material violence. 

#### 

#### Kaunert 21 (Kaunert, Christian, and Arif Sahar. \"Violence, terrorism, and identity politics in Afghanistan: The securitisation of higher education.\" *Social Sciences* 10.5 (2021): 150.)//GUCCISUSHI

Unlike other security sectors, [cybersecurity threats are]{.underline}
always [perceived in the form of attacks]{.underline}, or hostile,
purposeful, [and deliberate actions by an enemy]{.underline}/adversary
against the referent object(s). While this attack logic can still be
used occasionally in all sectors, it is the dominant one in
cybersecurity. [All cyber operations]{.underline}, even the
'defensive'[, involve the use of malware by an actor to gain
unauthorised access into the target's system.]{.underline} A
vulnerability in a system is not threatening per se if not exploited,
and this exploitation requires an adversary's or another party's
involvement. Although the resemblances with the military sector here are
high, one more aspect makes cybersecurity more distinctive: the question
of existentiality. According to the securitisation theory, the defining
feature of security is the idea of existentiality; i.e. security is
concerned with the survival of a certain referent object(s), which
justifies the calls for urgent responses. [In cybersecurity, despite
the]{.underline} existence of [existential discourses, the]{.underline}
existentiality [assumption is not as straightforward]{.underline} as it
is in other sectors for multiple reasons[. Firstly, the majority of
cyber attacks]{.underline} that are seen as the most serious in history
[were neither objectively existential from a technical viewpoint, nor
portrayed as such by the concerned actors. Stealing
military,]{.underline} commercial, [or personal information can hardly
affect the survival of the state,]{.underline} the private sector, or
any individual. Similarly, denying customers/citizens access to certain
services through denial of service attacks (DOS) does not pose an
existential threat to anyone. This does not mean that cyber threats
cannot be hyped, exaggerated, or presented in urgent terms, since all
those qualities are not essentially linked to existentiality. [Secondly,
the indirect nature of]{.underline} the majority of [cyber attacks and
the non-physicality of their consequences]{.underline}, although does
not undermine their seriousness and urgency, [acts as an impeding rather
than a facilitating condition to the existentiality
assumption.]{.underline} The empirical analysis also proves that
existentiality is not the only reason for threats to register in the
cybersecurity debate and that it is not a precondition for perceived
urgency. Generally, cybersecurity is marked by different understandings
of disruptive and destructive implications of cyber threats, and all
invoke a certain level of urgency. The majority of discourses emphasise
these 'disruptive' implications, including huge financial losses that
can slow down the economy, loss of productivity and global
competitiveness, customers' loss of confidence in the information
infrastructure, etc. Though not portrayed in 'survival' terms, these
disruptive implications are still perceived as immanent, urgent, and as
serious threats to national security.

Methodology This study takes a critical hermeneutical approach.
According to Gallagher (1992) critical or depth hermeneutics is
concerned with engaging ideology critique. He notes that, "[critique
calls for a special and suspicious interpretation of those ideologies
and institutions which support and maintain ruling power
structures]{.underline}" (Gallagher, 1992, p. 240). He cites [four
guiding principles related to critical **hermeneutics: 1) reproduction,
2) hegemony, 3) critical reflection and 4) application.**]{.underline}
Drawing from Habermas, Gallagher states that the [purpose of critical
interpretation is not simply to attempt to reproduce original meaning
but rather to **interrogate ideological positions** presented in
texts]{.underline}. A [critical or depth hermeneutic methodological
approach proposes that reproduction of texts without any critical
reflection on ideological representation only **serves to maintain
unequal power relations**]{.underline}. This [stands in sharp contrast
to traditional methodologies that follow strict non-critical,
non-reflective approaches concerned with reproducing the supposedly pure
words of the texts (or in the case of empirical research, the voice/s of
the subject/s of study). Related to the second principle,
hegemony]{.underline}, a depth hermeneutical approach would take the
perspective that ideology is embedded within linguistic symbols. Once
again, drawing from Habermas, Gallagher notes that [problematic ideology
distorts and serves the purpose of maintaining oppressive social
relations.]{.underline} Critical hermeneutics is concerned with
undistorting distorted communication, which takes place through engaging
in ideological critique. In other words, depth hermeneutics questions
the meaning behind linguistic symbols and to what extent does the
meaning collude in the reproduction of oppression. The third principle,
critical reflection places the interpreter in relationship to that being
interpreted. Gallagher states that "the purpose of critical reflection
is to assist in the achievement of emancipation the objectivity of
interpretation is seen either as a tool to be used in the pursuit of
emancipation or as a result of emancipation, but not as an end in itself
(p.244). The fourth principle of critical hermeneutics is application or
the idea that there exists ideal undistorted communication, which we
strive to achieve. A critical hermeneutic approach is guided by the
pursuit of freedom and transformation. In reflecting on Habermas‟ and
the principle of application, Gallagher (1992) writes, For Habermas,
application, which is the result of critical interpretation in the sense
that it always comes along with the practice of depth hermeneutics,
involves an escape from prejudice, a radical modification of the
anterior relation with the tradition process. The "deep" meaning
discovered by the critically suspicious interpretation is not only
enlightening but also emancipation for the interpreter. (p. 246) My
methodological framework, depth hermeneutics, is grounded by Derrick
Bell‟s [theory of racial realism (1992). This theory makes us aware of
the **real dynamic** and effects **of a racialized social system** for
Blacks. Although race may be a social construct, the social outcomes
produce concrete forms of inequality.]{.underline} Bell also concludes
that racism has such a dynamic in our society that it is unlikely that
Blacks will achieve full equality since American society is premised
upon a system of white supremacist domination. This [ideology penetrates
American consciousness to the point that no institution, individual or
group has not been touched or affected by it. **Racism will always
re-invent itself** in such a way as to maintain the hierarchy and the
subordinate status of Blacks]{.underline}. Thus, with each racial gain
achieved by Blacks, there are subsequent setbacks. [We can see the
evidence of this in the aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement. Of
course, the movement led to significant gains for Blacks. However,
antidiscriminatory laws have not successfully leveled the playing field.
Furthermore, in recent decades we have witnessed some backlash against
any goals or principles that might presumably lead to any potential
advantage for Blacks. We see how the language of the Civil Rights
Movement and subsequent laws are currently being used to deter from the
goal of racial equality and now a racial hierarchy. Racial realism tells
us that we must acknowledge the **historical endurance of anti-Black
racism** and understand that it has often been disguised.]{.underline}
This is particularly true in our contemporary age of colorblind race
politics. Therefore, we must be mindful of how anti-Blackness manifests
in the postCivil Rights era. A study influenced by racial realism would
critique the idea of abstract neutrality or pure deductive reasoning,
and instead acknowledge that research is also interpreted through social
knowledge. A study grounded in a racial realist approach would work
toward exposing and confronting anti-Black ideology in fields of thought
that collude in the perpetuation of a racial hierarchy. For example,
from a racial realist perspective [even those discourses that are
presented as "critical" or still yet "anti-racist" discourses may also
be complicit in the preservation of anti-Black ideology. This means that
even presumably critical discourses on race must be studied from the
perspective that they take a particular social position]{.underline},
also understand Blacks from a particular social position and maneuver
theoretically based upon that understanding. Racial realism is premised
upon ideological critique. My [study is rooted in this method of
inquiry. In Ideology and Modern Culture]{.underline}, Jon Thompson
(1990) highlights the debate in defining the notion of ideology.
Ideology has its origins in Marxist theory and the idea of false
consciousness. Ideology is seen as negative in that it supports the
status quo and delimits the **[development of counter-hegemonic
consciousness]{.underline}** among the working class. Ideology
illusively hides unequal relations of power between dominant and
subordinate groups. Other theoretical perspectives propose that ideology
is neutral, moving away from the purely pejorative connotation.
Ideologies can be regarded then as „systems of thought‟, „systems of
belief‟, or „symbolic systems‟ which pertain to social action or
political stance" (Thompson, 1990, p.5). In this light, all political
action and thought is ideological. I concur with Thompson‟s (1990)
critical conception of ideology in which he finds that, [the analysis of
ideology is primarily concerned with the ways in which forms intersect
with relations of power. It is concerned with the ways in which meaning
is mobilized in the social world and serves thereby to bolster up
individuals and groups who occupy positions of power. To study ideology
is to study the ways in which meaning serves to establish and sustain
relations of domination. Ideological phenomena are meaningful symbolic
phenomena in so far as they serve, in particular social historical
circumstances, to establish and sustain relations of
domination.]{.underline} (p.56) Nicolas Burbules (1995) proposes five
forms of ideology critique including (1) scientific, (2) immanent, (3)
deconstructionist, (4) argument from effects, and (5) counter-ideology[.
Scientific critiques see ideologies as distorted and irrational. They
examine ideologies for the ways in which they distort the truth.
Immanent critiques reveal how ideologies often do not "measure up to
their own standards" (p.57). The critic reveals the contradictions that
belie a particular standpoint or position. Burbules states that the
third form, the deconstructivist approach, takes the position that there
are no universal truths or metanarratives.]{.underline} The fourth form
of ideological critique, argument from effects, takes the stand that we
must examine the outcome or consequences of ideological positions and
then critique those that uphold domination or perpetuate unequal systems
of power. The final form of critique is counter-ideology, which proposes
that ideological critic challenge ideologies with other
counter-hegemonic ideologies. Burbules (1995) notes that there are both
possibilities in and limitations to each form of ideological critique he
describes[. He proposes that we approach the process from the
perspective of critiquing ideology as **a way of working on developing
critical thought**.]{.underline} Additionally, he proposes that the work
of the ideological critic is to understand people on their own terms, in
their journey towards changing perspectives as they are introduced to
new ways of thinking about the world. And while, as an educator, I do
tend to concur to some degree with the position, I strongly disagree
with his presupposition that we must not refute ideologies but rather
attempt to induce people towards transformative thinking. For instance[,
I see my role as ideological critic as one that is guided by racial
realism]{.underline} and the commitment to refute and challenge forms of
antiBlackness or what I see as ideologies that uphold the oppression and
subjugation of Black people. By intersecting racial realism with
ideological critique I propose a study that will critique the presence
of anti-Black ideology in post-Civil Rights racial discourses on
multiracialism, culture, and those defined as moving beyond the
Black/white paradigms (e.g., LatCrit and AsianCrit). I have selected
these fields of thought because they represent contemporary discourses
on race that purported reject binary racial thinking in an attempt to
offer new theoretical insight into U.S. race relations. Each field of
thought dedicates substantial scholarship to problematizing the presence
of Blackness in U.S. racial thought. Though individual texts were
selected and interpreted in relationship to anti-Black ideology, taken
as a whole, these texts represent a larger pervasive anti-Black
discourse that works to sustain the racial hierarchy. As an ideological
critic I am concerned with challenging ideology that sustains unequal
power relations. Anti-Black discourse sustains a racial hierarchy that
places Blacks at the bottom. My responsibility as an ideological critic
is to unpack that ideology colluding in the oppression of Blacks. As
Thompson (1990) states, ideological critique proposes a contestation or
challenge to systems of domination by unveiling precisely how they
manifest, are defended and also become unquestionably part of social
reality. I first will begin with a review of literature comprising the
following areas: racial hierarchy in the post-Civil Rights era;
globalized anti-Blackness; ethnicity and the structure of racism; and
the construction of the Black body.

#### Scenario planning relies on rubrics of futurity indentured to uneven distribution of power. Their "emergency governance" logics generate racialized assemblages under the guise of liberal democracy, increasing racial divisions and calcifying racial violence.

As we have detailed elsewhere (Anderson et al., 2020), attention to this
[uneven distribution of futurity]{.underline} orients thought [on
emergency governance and its underlying]{.underline} biopolitical
[rationalities towards a founding violence]{.underline} in ways that
[are attuned to]{.underline} historically specific [racialising
assemblages]{.underline} (Weheliye, 2014). These assemblages mark some
subjects as White, fully human and in possession of lives worthy of
protection, pastoral care, and perpetuation, while marking others as
Black, female, less-than-human objects in the future-making projects of
White male subjects.1 [These deep divisions]{.underline} between and
[across lives means that the dominant linear temporal imaginary of
emergency management]{.underline}---which envisions a smooth transition
between phases of the event from disruption, to response, and ending
with post-event recovery---is revealed as not equally applicable for all
subjects. Only some subjects are automatically presumed to have a right
to post-event recovery; for others, such a future is always contingent
and precarious---that is, always an emergency but a slow and
unrecognised one. In the case of COVID-19, the question, then, is how
the spectacular event/disruption of COVID-19 and its associa ted
emergency measures intersect with liberalism's racially uneven
distribution of futurity. In this light, [emergency
measures]{.underline} both [help generate uneven racial, gender, and
class impacts]{.underline}, as has been well documented (Ali & Keil,
2008; Mullings et al., 2010), and they are also vectors along which the
racialising assemblages that condition normal, "pre-event" life are
reinforced or perhaps challenged. Rather than the smooth performance of
COVID-19 as a classic time-bound emergency against a neutral background,
we argue that current response measures (and efforts to motivate people
to cope with them) reflect how the COVID-19 emergency has been
intersecting with context-specific manifestations of the multiple slow
emergencies such as racism, patriarchy, poverty, biodiversity loss, and
climate change that characterise normal liberal life and its arithmetic
of futurity. We expand on this argument and approach in section two,
exploring the relations between emergency responses and uneven
distributions of futurity. The subsequent sections bear witness to some
of the ways in which slow emergencies in Australia and the United States
have intersected with responses to COVID-19, specifically responses
which prioritised a return to or perpetuation of post-pandemic
normality. Section 3 examines how Australian planning for post-COVID-19
recovery is based on continued state endorsement of the fossil fuel
economy, [in]{.underline} doing so [preserving existing distributions of
power, and intensifying the future harms associated with climate
change.]{.underline} In this process, [the uneven distribution of
futurity that underpins Whiteness and maleness is
reproduced.]{.underline} White masculinity is also at stake in our next
example---anti-lockdown protests in the United States. Section 4
considers how they emerged out of a dissonance between the immediate
pandemic response, on the one hand, and the expectations of White
privilege, on the other. In both cases, we see how specific slow
emergencies---[human-induced]{.underline} climate change and [anti-Black
violence]{.underline} in White supremacist societies
respectively---[become intensified as liberal order recalibrates
itself]{.underline} in response to the event of COVID-19. In the
conclusion in section 5, we argue that some responses to COVID-19
intensify the uneven distribution of futurity that structure liberal
governance. Emergency is an effort to ensure the continuity of the
future. A happening is named and governed as an emergency not only
because it threatens harm, damage, and loss but also crucially because
its outcome(s) remains uncertain: the future is open. The uncertainty of
the future relates not only to what might be harmed, damaged, or lost
but also the means through which the actual and/or threatening event is
addressed and (if possible) brought to an end. In the assumption of both
the openness of the future and the possibility of active intervention
making a difference, emergency is part of a modern relation with time
and temporality (Koselleck, 2004). Because of this distinctive relation
with the future, emergency also reconfigures the present--future
relation. The present becomes an interval for action, imbued with a more
or less fragile hope that the event is not over, and that action can
still be effective (Anderson, 2017). [The governance of emergency has
been a recurring problem for liberal democracies]{.underline} such as,
in our cases here, Australia and the United States. For polities
organised around the principles of liberal political philosophy, such as
[universalising appeals to individual equality and freedom]{.underline}
(ideal assumptions that, as we will see, [are]{.underline} in practice
[highly racialised]{.underline}), the ability to respond to an emergency
does not rely on an individual sovereign figure who exercises an
absolute decision in the time--space of emergency but rather leanson a
dense administrative machinery calibrated to "anticipate and govern
emergency situations within the framework of constitutional liberalism"
(Collier & Lakoff, 2015, p. 37[). Logics of]{.underline} anticipatory
action and [calculative, imaginative, and other techniques]{.underline}
congeal in a variety of styles of emergency management that [develop
capacities to anticipate]{.underline}, respond to, [and recover from
emergency events without recourse to a state of exception]{.underline}
(Anderson, 2010). Importantly, these logics often operate through
distinct visions of the temporality of emergency (Neisser & Runkel,
2017) and so involve different ways of relating to futures and acting in
the present. For example[, logics of]{.underline} preparedness rely on
techniques of [scenario planning]{.underline} to identify capacities and
limitations in existing emergency response protocols. These anticipatory
practices [mobilise fear]{.underline} and anxiety that "we are not
prepared!" [to compel action in the present]{.underline}. The aim is [to
develop specific response capacities that will prevent future unexpected
events from unfolding into catastrophic systemic breakdowns]{.underline}
(Collier & Lakoff, 2008; O'Grady, 2018). Logics of resilience, in
contrast, view future systemic disruptions as inevitable and utilise
techniques [such as]{.underline} community based training and
[simulations to work on affective relations between individuals and
their environments]{.underline}. [These techniques attempt to
design]{.underline} resilient "cultures of safety," metastable social
and ecological systems capable of topologically transforming in ways
that preserve the system's form, function, and identity while undergoing
change (Grove, 2018). Different logics of anticipatory action---notably
the logic of resilience---can be seen at work in the various GROVE ET
AL. 3 responses to COVID-19, even as COVID-19 as an event mixes fast and
slow temporalities, and distributed and punctual spatialities, in ways
that perhaps differ from other events that are usually governed as
emergencies.

#### Fiat and crisis representations are built upon racialized logics of coloniality, extraction, and accumulation within systems of global racial capital.

We are at a crossroads. The modern condition, bordering on the
irreparable, demands creative, ethico-poetic approaches, insights, and
real leaps (Fanon,

near future']{.underline}

earth, social sciences, and literary studies** alike]{.underline}.
Guided by a combined fantasy of catastrophe and 'forced presentist'
macroeconomic models, many **[climate change analysts focus on crisis
and call for immediate fixes through market forces for a future
prioritizing a clean fight in the short term rather than a livable
planet]{.underline}**. Research and institutional calls conceptually
divide economic time into short and long term, speaking to a shift from
theories of value (land, labour) to a 'mathematical economics based on
market demand and supply' (Guyer,

p. 409, citing Marshall, 1890). These temporal linear presuppositions
inhere in thought and socio-technical imaginaries (Jasanoff & Kim,
[2016](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)),
in economic models, in planning, in struggles to reduce gas emissions
and lower temperatures, and in ecoterrorism and conservation movements.
A shift in 'temporal framing has involved a double move, toward both
very short and very long sightedness, with a symmetrical evacuation of
the near past and the near future' (Guyer,
[2007](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 409). Planetary colonization is a different kind of moment, and
requires a different kind of inquiry (Nancy,
[2007](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400);

[2020a](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
[Our times]{.underline}, to remember Fanon, [must acknowledge that the
**ravages of colonialism and empire, including ecological degradation,
may have immured life and livelihoods,** but have also immured the ways
we read and write history and theories of inquiry that speak to
ideological productions at the intellectual level and experience in a
given conjuncture.]{.underline} Jean-Luc Nancy argues our global present
'demands that we ... discern in capital another type or another kind of
a flaw than what we understood to be insurmountable contradictions'
([2007](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 53). For him, this is the moment 'to expose capital to \[its\]
absence of reason, for which capital provides the fullest development'
([2007](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 53; Hosseini & Gills
[2020b](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
Hosseini and Gills push this exposition of [the irrationality of reason
to argue the need to problematize the 'way the ruling systems have
shaped the foundations of our imagination and inquiry']{.underline}
([2020a](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 14). For radical existence to emerge, it is imperative to 'keep
pushing our debates beyond the contours of Eurocentric,
(post-)modernist, or liberal humanist perspectives' (Hosseini & Gills,
[2020a](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 14). [**In addition to calls to expose capital's fantasies and
irrationality, we argue along with Fanon that our times demand we
'constantly remind \[ourselves\] that the real leap consists in
introducing invention into existence**']{.underline} (Fanon,
[1967](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 229). Invention in a Fanonian sense, David Marriott tells us, '[can
never be 'enslaved' by the past, and its meaning circumscribed by
history]{.underline}'
([2014](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 518) [or utopian imaginaries]{.underline}. Rather, 'what the leap
implies is a situation of radical indecision whose emergence introduces
something entirely new into the world' (Marriott,
[2014](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 518). Our moment demands this kind of inquiry, 'this imperious leap'
(Marriott,
[2014](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 518), or what Frantz Fanon calls the turn to invention, for the
crafting of conditions for decolonial ecologies. Judgment on the
planetary as a colonial neo-tech-imperial project (Bianco,
[2004](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400))
demands not only a focus on the complex notion of the longue durée
seeking to show how [**global racial capitalism's violence persists as
the 'essence' of structures and the present moment's material struggles
and ecological violence but also on those signs of an irreducible and
heterogeneous singularity**. A starting point is the language of the
structural relations of time with racial
planetary-capitalism.]{.underline} Our interest is whether and how
[racial capitalism as an emergent world-ecology project]{.underline} (in
its more contemporary iterations of expansionist neocolonialisms,
ongoing enslavements, and ecological deracinations) [reaches its
perverse zenith in the form of persisting power or what Toni Morrison
calls the pathology and perversity of modernity]{.underline}. What else
could have been known if the leaders of European modernity and modern
knowledge had not limited, appropriated, and even obliterated sources of
life and inventions and their contingent visions about the planetary and
life in the name of a global racial planetary capitalist order? **[What
else could have emerged if the leaders of European history did not
shackle the 'muscles and intelligences of men and women']{.underline}**
(Fanon,
[1967](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400))
**[for global racial capitalism's desires and temporal redirections and
orientations?]{.underline}** What is the role of time as a condition, a
structure, an insight, and a force in this conversation? Admittedly, the
question of time and climate change is widely discussed (e.g.
Chakrabarty,
[2012](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400);

Simpson,
[2017](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
While some notable exceptions afford time a crucial role in thinking
about planetary justice (Whyte,
[2018](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)),
many more simply presume time in their conversations about planetary
imaginaries, ecology and transformation, crisis, reparative justice, and
the future. The attempts of capitalism to infinitely extract for profit
have been challenged by both social scientists and earth scientists, the
latter of whom recently argued for abandoning the focus on the
industrial revolution and turning to the mid-twentieth century, the
'golden spike' of the Anthropocene. 16 July 1945, when the first nuclear
bomb was detonated with the suitably metaphysical name of the Trinity
Test, could be considered the Anthropocene's symbolic starting date
because 'to many physicists, the epoch-defining feature of modernity is
the mobilization of the stupendous energy deriving from the splitting of
the atomic nucleus, a scientific as much as geopolitical and theological
feat' (Saldhana,
[2020](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 28). Though this is not considered a Global Boundary Stratotype
Section and Point (GSSP) date, scientists argue it can be considered 'a
geological marker out of convenience' (Saldhana,
[2020](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 28; citing Zalasiewicz et al.,
[2015](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
The year 1945 also marks the geopolitical zoning of the three worlds as
the international system, along with the new set up of the monetary and
postcolonial liberal order, with the United Nations, Bretton Woods as
multilateral institutions and the 'great acceleration of baby boom, mass
consumption, and mobility with their environmental impacts' (Saldhana,
[2020](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 28). Earth scientists Lewis and Maslin
([2018](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400))
set 1964 as the date for GSSP because this was the year of the peak of
radioactive carbon-14 and its sedimentation in trees. They also
suggested 1610, which allows a link with the colonization of the
Americas, but the radioactive dust is the determining force. Different
notions, epistemes, and structures of time as articulated in these
debates are productive of classification, ordering, and managing of
populations and ecologies. Assumed structures of time play a key role in
the co-ordering of ecological and social processes and the
racial-capitalist planetary order. As Sheila Jasanoff writes,
'Co-production is shorthand for the proposition that the ways in which
we know and represent the world (both nature and society) are
inseparable from the ways in which we chose to live in'
([2004](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 9). Perhaps because it is so obvious, most of us do not think much
about how this co-production inheres and prescribes linear progression
of past, present, and future in infrastructures of thought that end up
contributing to configurations of certain institutions, including the
sovereign state, ecological relations of people and the material systems
that support them (i.e. colonial, and genocidal regimes of extraction of
labour, lands, resources, and life). These lived temporalities embody 'a
tapestry of exploitation and expropriation interwoven so as to reproduce
the means of maintaining the ruling class lifestyle' (McGee & Greiner,
[2020](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 1). Universal time, or the time standard based on Earth\'s rotation,
is deeply rooted in the ecological processes that suture fossil fuels
and racial violence, for instance, and enables the shifts and
entwinements of racial capitalism and world ecology.
**[Time]{.underline}**, thus, is a condition, that [**is, a set of
circumstances that affect people's and ecologies' life, a structure**
(i.e. its duration), **technology, and a tool at the forefront of
colonial and imperial governance;** it is linked with memories and
imaginations of force and violence and the demands by racial others for
'the end of the world as we know it or decolonization]{.underline}' (da
Silva,
[2018](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
The stakes of such engagements in planetary conversations are high[.
They are about life and the possibility for decolonial and radical
alterities. **Focusing on the structures of time that co-produce the
ecological and the racial capitalist planetary order can allow an
engagement with the fatal choices made for, about, and in the name of
the planetary, racial others, natures, black, indigenous, and other
marginalized communities**.]{.underline} By grappling with the language
of the structure of time (i.e. the planetary as a climate emergency) and
its relation to the shifts of the ecological order, including
indeterminate moments, we argue against the easy conceptual inclusion of
planetary worlds and experiences that have been denied or ignored. We
argue against the rush of those calls that demand the integrating of
longue durée or durations of geographical imperial structures and the
way they inform the planetary history without grappling with the
stickiness of time. Such processes crystallize time in ways that
preserve some presents and some pasts and not others; each moment of
such temporal structures embodies 'what happens or what fails to happen,
or what happens long after it is past, as the unity of what could not
happen but do and what could have happened but did not' (Marriott, 2013,
pp. 192--193). In what follows, we engage with theorists whose work
imagines, theorizes, de-potentializes, and suspends time to respond to
the ecosystem's shifts and possibilities for radical existence. A focus
by some such theorists on crisis/emergency as the exception, we argue,
enables restoration of an imagined desired 'normal' or 'equilibrium'.
First, we engage with McKibben, who calls for the restoration of a
certain temporal capitalist order (e.g. by using carbon budgets).
Instead of understanding time as a given in concepts of crisis or
emergency or from the perspective of neoclassical economics as a
'mechanical parameter within ... production' (Kolinjivadi et al.,
[2020](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 910), we argue that reflecting on the inhering epistemes and
conceptualizations of time in these imaginaries and projects exposes the
production of 'crisis' and 'catastrophe' as wagers that secure certain
secular and teleological ends without putting pressure on the
relationship of the structure of time and its suspension or tabula rasa
(Fanon,
[1967](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
Second, we engage with authors who analyse the relationship of linearity
and justice, and the extent to which linearity is central to justice
claims -- whether transitional or revolutionary. Finally, we conclude
with a question: what happens when instead of focusing on
urgencies/catastrophes, we introduce invention into the planetary and
existence? What happens when our work itself is an invention, a series
of leaps 'characterized by points of departure rather than endings'
(Marriott,
[2014](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 518) from the world as we know it? Time as a fatal confusion?
Environmentalist Bill McKibben suggests 'the time to freak out over
climate change is now'
([2019](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
In earlier work, he argues one of the key problems with climate change
is a 'fatal confusion about the nature of time and space' (McKibben,
[2003](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 7). This confusion, he contends, is a result of Western society's
distinctions between the time of culture and the time of nature
(McKibben,
[2003](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 7). McKibben argues against this Cartesian fiction. The melting of
glaciers, mass extinctions, and the depletion of resources are
accelerating, but humans are reacting slowly
([2003](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 12). A leading strategist of the US climate change movement who
pushed 'the threat of climate change into the mainstream American
political agenda' (Nisbet,
[2013](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 41), McKibben highlights the role of 'time in managing the
intertwined relationality of everyday life' (Bastian,
[2012](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 25). For him, the question of climate change is one of coordination
and synchronization. **[Technologies like the clock]{.underline}** (i.e.
Coordinated Universal Time) **[used to universally coordinate
life]{.underline}** (Bastian,
[2012](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400);
McKibben,
[2003](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400))
**[simply 'enable the status quo to continue unimpeded]{.underline}**'
(Bastian,
[2012](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 25; citing McKibben,
[2003](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
McKibben argues for a sense of coordination in the battle for the
future: 'It\'s a particular kind of fight ... A battle for winning the
sense of what\'s inevitable or not. What\'s the world going to look
like. And that battle is, well -- that\'s everything' (McKibben,
[2015](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
Distinguishing his vision for a new future for the planet from the
vision of the fossil-fuel industry, McKibben tells climate activists to
problematize the status quo: 'Creativity is the absolute most important
thing in this fight'
([2015](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
In Deep Economy, McKibben argues it is possible for enlightened
consumers to build sustainable economies through their everyday choices.
The ecological footprint and the solution to twenty-first-century
problems, such as climate change, can be redressed without having to
give up democratic or progressive values. McKibben calls readers to act
now by altering their consumption patterns and voluntarily making the
transition to a viable future 'tolerable, even sweet, instead of tragic'
([2007](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 232). In this book, he shows how people have been involving
themselves in small-scale projects by extracting themselves from the
global economy. [Drawing on several local and collective projects from
the Global South he argues these experiments are promising paths of
greener development, steps that will prove crucial in the face of global
warming. He suggests such voluntary initiatives lead to the restoration
of 'the reality of what our world can provide']{.underline}
([2015](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 4), given the earth's certain absolute limits. McKibben's resolution
of the exceptional emergency is based on a linearly punctuated
voluntarism. [But this simple **linear coding conceals** a complex
series of questions about **how just futures may be engineered and by
whom**. Historical events are not equally distributed along a linear
axis. This bending of the climate linearity toward the temporal
imbalance misses how these moments appear as the events that will
restore the temporal order]{.underline}. McKibben's calls point to how
time as a fatal confusion is related to his understanding of what is to
come. In fact, time as a fatal confusion stretches thought about the
relationality of 'culture' and 'nature.' [Some have sought to use clock
time, or universal human time, to coordinate action. One example is the
Hundred Months clock developed by the New Economics Foundation in
2008]{.underline}. It counts how many months are left for us to take
action to avoid Earth's average surface temperature rising more than
2°C. If nothing is done in this period, it will be too late. Far from
indicating empty homogeneous time, the clock 'tells us that everything
that we do from now matters' (Bastian,
[2012](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 39). The use of such clocks proposes 'a measure of the 'before' and
'after' to facilitate a communal reorientation' and mobilization for
action 'towards the dangerous changes currently taking place' (Bastian,
[2012](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 40). However, this attempt to figure out how to coordinate ourselves
may require not just 'radical refigurations of the clock' (Bastian,
[2012](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 40) but also an understanding of how the arrangement of situations
presumes a figurative capacity of theoretical and historical writing
hostile to certain ecologies, knowledge, ideas, and those relegated to
the margins of colonial, enslaving, and racial imperial orders. For
McKibben, **[this change is to be driven 'not by government fiat but by
local desire and necessity]{.underline}**'
([2007](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 3). Local initiatives seem to be the cure-all for the excesses of
global capitalism, yet he says, '**[No one wants to do away with
markets, or to centrally plan economies']{.underline}**
([2007](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 225). To avoid temporal confusion, he attacks 'growth,' 'the cult of
More'
([2007](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 177), or 'the doctrine of endless economic expansion'
([2007](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 24) but without explicitly challenging or opening the 'ecological
crisis' to questions of black, indigenous, and postcolonial designs of
thought and activism, as for example, in the work of Frantz Fanon, Kyle
Whyte, Leanne Simpson, and Romy Opperman (see also Black Ecologies) and
Achille Mbembe to name a few. [These authors are not satisfied to use
the notion of time as a fatal confusion; rather, they take on time. For
them, the **relationship between racism/coloniality and ecological
degradation cannot be addressed or even transformed by focusing on
crisis or emergency**. They grapple with the ways **we historicize and
analyse black, indigenous, and diasporic ecologies and examine how such
people are 'most susceptible to the effects of climate change, including
rising sea levels, subsidence, sinking land, as well as ongoing effects
of toxic stewardship'**]{.underline} (Roane & Hosbey,
[2019](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400))
[because of the relations of temporal orientations and the planetary
racial imperial order: 'these same communities, ... have bearing on how
we should historicize the current crisis and how we conceive of futures
outside of destruction']{.underline} (Roane & Hosbey,
[2019](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
Romy Opperman argues **[capitalism and white supremacist settler states
are not interested in the 'survival and the flourishing of racialized
people]{.underline}**, nor that of the environments in which we live'
(Opperman,
[2020](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
For her, the desire to return to 'normal' temporal orders is a
business-as-usual political imaginary, reaffirming that 'normal
\[which\] means the plunder of the earth's resources, the wars for these
resources, not to mention the practices that destroy, dehumanize, and
oppress life in its myriad forms on this earth' (Opperman,
[2020](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
'[Alternative political imaginaries-to the state and capital,' she says,
are more urgent than ever]{.underline} (Opperman,
[2020](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
[The naming of what we currently face as crisis or emergency evades the
ways radical black ecologies, that is, black thinkers, movements, and
communities and their insurgencies have been disavowed in accounts of
what counts as history's long durée or event. **Radical black ecologies
'have refused the ruse that capitalism, the state, heteropatriarchy, and
the domination of more-than-human nature are the means and ends of
justice and freedom'**]{.underline} (Opperman,
[2020](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
For her, black ecologies open the relations of the structure of time and
racial capital regimes to question by crossing colonial and enslaving
historical boundaries and their contingent events or by suspending them.
Françoise Vergès points to the racialized nature of modern capitalism;
she proposes an expansion of Jason Moore's alternative periodizing of
our current time as the Capitalocene, what Moore calls 'the historical
era shaped by the endless accumulation of capital' (Moore,
[2015b](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 596), into an explicitly 'racial Capitalocene,' an epoch when the
'environment \[is\] shaped by slavery and colonialism' (Vergès,
[2017](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 73). For her, this methodology allows us to 'write a history of the
environment that includes slavery, colonialism, imperialism, and racial
capitalism, from the standpoint of those who were ... fabricated as
disposable people, whose lives do not matter' (Vergès,
[2017](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 73). For her, it is imperative that we contest colonialism and
enslavement in a more general description of their language of race.
Vergès puts pressure on the idea of 'ecological crisis' and broadens it
to be an effect of a racial planetary capital regime that depends on
force and violence to transmute and maintain the conditions of its
existence. Such a 'crisis' entangles slavery, colonialism, imperialism
with the planetary and racial capitalism. It is important to remember
the Cartesian production of reality: the division, hierarchization, and
sequencing of culture as value and nature as without value (da Silva,
[2017](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
The Cartesian/cogito subject is redeemed by time rather than space (the
'dark' side of Western reason, progress, and the rational subject).
Human mastery of the social realm follows the mastery of nature.
Liberation from the two tyrannies -- nature and irrational social
authority -- is inevitable, as progress set in motion will culminate in
a final Tenth Epoch when 'social art' will triumph (Condorcet,
[1793](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
This world is buoyed up by linear history as the new order of things, a
history in which the West\'s advanced evolutionary development
reproduces the subject and the sovereign territorial state as the telos
of natural and historical development. In this understanding, Europe
traditionally asserted 'world' history as the natural order of things,
an evolutionary struggle of the fit against the unfit, with Europe
leading the pack. Michel Foucault argues a semblance of European unity
was shattered during the nineteenth century with the destruction of
'natural' time and the concomitant birth of interest in history:
'histories of everything emerged at the moment man was 'emptied' of
history' (Foucault,
[1973](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
pp. 367--370). Richard Terdiman says the obsession with time in the
nineteenth century was a 'crisis of diachronicity'
([1993](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 15), an abyss opening between a past forever destroyed and a present
showing no clear way to the future. The late twentieth century developed
precisely when 'nature' and the 'naturalizing' of space by Europeans
faced 'a crisis of synchronicity' (Terdiman,
[1993](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 15) in the return of the 'others' that Europe and European discourse
had systematically colonized, enslaved, and marginalized. Europe (and
the US) wanted to blank out and reabsorb those racial others who refused
their role as nature and nature as a thing; the answer was to rethink
space. Recently, with the 'extensive and intensive extraction of matter
from the earth, in the form of fossil fuels, soil nutrients to feed
crops and livestock, and the (human and more-than-human) work' and 'the
internal energy of African slaves and Indigenous lands' which 'now
exist ... as the form of global capital' (da Silva,
[2018](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)),
thinking historically and naturally has been problematized and even
replaced by thinking about crisis and the future. Despite its apparent
valorization of crisis, discourse on time does not easily engorge the
racial others. Even nature, the global capital\'s utopic wish-form,
functions as a 'cannibalistic force,' encircling everything in its
'gigantic phagocytosis' (Caillois & Shepley,
[1984](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 28). [**Drawing on indigenous climate change studies and the
Plantationocene, Bikrum Gill argues the 'decolonial turn in the epoch
debates has foregrounded Indigenous and Black alterity as the necessary
epistemic point of departure for overcoming social and ecological
crises'**
([2021](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 913) thereby challenging the idea that the human must be
removed.]{.underline} As he further argues, the 'question of restoring
the earth' is 'one of centreing Indigenous and Black sovereignties that
resurge/restore social-geological capacities that both brought into
being, and sustained over a long durée, the earth system as composition
of distinct, yet co-constituting, earth-worldings' (Gill,
[2021](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 926). Gill orients the reader to moving beyond conquest and focusing
on what he calls the Cortesian axis, that is, the time when the
'capitalist enclosure' and the racialized production of the
society/nature distinctions occurred by 'appropriating Indigenous and
Black earth-worlds' as well as exhausting them ecologically by erasing
'their underlying conditions' of possibility (Gill,
[2021](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 926). This reading points to deeper temporal connections that evade
the underlying 'social-ecological/social-geological reproductive
conditions' (Gill,
[2021](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 925) that make possible the epistemes of ecologists and
environmentalists, including how human and nonhuman ecologies are
sutured together; thus, planetary, and racial justice cannot be achieved
through separated efforts and not through the dismantling of racial
capitalism without engaging with its structures of time. Several authors
have put pressure on the dominant structure of time of this regime by
challenging its Coordinated Universal Time (e.g. Baucom,
[2014](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400);
Opperman,
[2020](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400);
Wynter,
[2003](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400))
and the social-ecological relations of capitalism. They question the
edifice of time: as 'linear, predictable and \[guided by the\]
disciplining coordination metrics of modern clocks and calendars'
(Kolinjivadi et al.,
[2020](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 906). Naturalizing time as a fixed and presupposed object to be
leveraged for accumulation planetary regimes reinforces global capital's
assumptions about its 'eternal scarcity' and 'growth imperative'
(Kolinjivadi et al.,
[2020](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 906). Inquiring into the ways the planetary and its contingent
institutions are bounded reveals how certain structures of time are
prescribed in histories and destinies in advance. It is important to
challenge the easy reading of geographical contexts and time, for
instance, of suturing context and nature and context and culture. A
taken-for-granted geographical context such as a national territory or
locality only allows circular self-referencing, ''proving' itself by
means of its own production, its 'context'' (Walker,
[2012](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 8). In this sense, analysis becomes implicit or marginalized in the
name of proving history, context, or grammars and logics, as in the
epoch debates of setting the 'date,' the 'Anthropocene,' and the
'Capitalocene' (Amoureux & Reddy,
[2021](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400);
Gill,
[2021](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400);
Kolia,
[2021](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400))
as well as identifying geographies that confirm abstract notions of
genocide and exploitation. The stakes in these debates are not just to
get the date (origin or otherwise) right by either presupposing it or
injecting it at some point in the future; the goal is to see whether it
is possible for the invention of existence or that moment 'whose
destination cannot be foreseen, or anticipated, but only repeatedly
traveled, and, therefore, not future at all' (Marriott,
[2011a](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 54), that 'moment of inventiveness' (Marriott,
[2011a](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
pp. 53--54) 'to change the order of the world' (Fanon,
[1967](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 36). We stretch these authors' analytics. We argue colonial and
enslaving extractions and grammars have immured nature and the source of
existence in the making of a planetary, as their primary goal is to
settle to whom the earth belongs (Mbembe,
[2021](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
Through this process, racial imperial capital retroactively invalidates
dynamic and heterogeneous temporalities and existential relations by
claiming it functions because of its own birthed locality. Thus,
thinking and imagining decolonial compositions requires a leap, an
invention to overturn what planetary racial capitalist regimes block:
potential inventions for a decolonial planetary. What's in a date:
transition, adaptation or the end of the world? The fatal confusion of
time is itself a fiction. Modernity is running out of places and lives
to despoil. Thus, [**imagining and organizing order through the
technology of time created and enforced by legal and sovereign regimes,
force and violence change the ecology and environments, not according to
their own Promethean logic but rather to our dominant logics that equate
time and matter, matter, and value.**]{.underline} These same dominant
logics, Marriott tell us through Frantz Fanon, guide the 'originary
constitutive category of race' (Marriott, 2013, p. 194). Certain
structures of time are generated and continue to give life to certain
possibilities and futures because they are harnessed to a particular
political vision: an imperial neoliberal world order which depends on
the expenditure of existence in extraction, conquest, and obliteration.
Concepts like crisis, progress, reason, equilibrium, and metabolic rifts
are as temporal as they are scientific. Mann provides insight into the
Anthropocene's introduction as the fix for the liberal-Capitalocene.
Drawing on Domenico Losurdo's notion of 'macroscopic exclusion clauses,'
Mann argues liberalism 'displaced unfreedom from a white male bourgeois
European who was the historical agent in the \[liberal\] narrative,
\[and\] those exclusions were generally spatial'
([2005](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 4). However, liberalism used a 'principal temporal means' to
sublimate its failures through the 'concept of crisis or emergency'
([2005](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 4). Mann points to a crucial management of imperialism: 'Adaptation'
supplants 'progress' as the telos of the age. The pairing of crisis and
stability, exception, and norm, emergency, and nonemergency, is at the
core of what I call liberalism's reality management system. This family
of concepts is also central to the ways in which a lot of social
science, not only orthodox but 'critical,' tries to make sense of the
world. Each of its members only makes sense insofar as it conjures up an
equilibrium or ordinary against which its extraordinariness is
notable ... . \[P\]ermanent emergency is an oxymoron.
([2005](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 4) Mann highlights the absence of reason of global planetary
imperialism and suggests the telos of the new imaginary guiding
liberalism is adaptation. Adaptation is an evolutionary process through
which species 'claim a niche to which they are best fitted, and
continually develop in a complex competivive environment' of repeating
the past by rejecting any 'divergence within the movement of return, and
the creation of a new object' (Bignell,
[2019](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
pp. 149, 150--151). Thus, the 'dual temporality of the repetition
involved in adaptation, and the ideas of progression, reworking, and
return, are aspects of how this Darwinian process is connected' to how
we articulate and read history (Bignell,
[2019](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 151). Liberalism's dominant notions (progress, freedom, stability)
are supplanted, and 'adaptation' becomes the end-goal. Such a move does
not invite the reader to problematize the grounding, linear, and
transcendental, and adaptation conditions that make a certain
understanding of the planetary possible. Rather, it requires an
expenditure of heterogeneous political energies toward the production of
a coherent, national-capitalist ecological-body politic. Exposing the
major elements (air, water, earth, fire) as existential natures (human
and otherwise) to various morbidities, ranging from toxic environments
to material risk and dangers in the name of exception and emergency
places the nation-state at the helm of the consolidation of a planetary
project organized in a 'linear sequence of moments called 'time''
(Kolinjivadi et al.,
[2020](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 906), while displacing its presuppositions about the notion of change
as simply the passing of time. This evades that adaptation is the
process through which existence is reordered through imperialism and
capitalization. Adaptation seems to be the process of reworking elements
that are heterogeneous and oppositional to the conquest and capture that
render the possibility of the emergence of the capitalist planetary
regime uncertain. Relations of the racial capitalist planetary are
'coordinated to temporalities that are qualitatively heterogeneous'. The
racial capitalist planetary regimes use temporal mechanisms like
adaptation by 'enroll\[ing\] ... desynchronizations back into raw
material for \[global\] capital' (Kolinjivadi et al.,
[2020](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 912). [For example, notions like crisis or emergency, or projects
like the **SDGs that highlight green technologies, do not necessarily
reveal their assumptions about their horizons or their notion of change
beyond a universal clock time.** The parties who set up targets and
indicators 'may align them to any arbitrary deadline set by the clock
(e.g. from now until 2030) but will perpetually remain fundamentally
detached from the tempos of biophysical change for which they set to
respond to']{.underline} (Kolinjivadi et al.,
[2020](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 913). Here, of course, paying attention to biophysical change and the
way we read it is imperative. These parties sustain the self-evidence of
these planetary regimes without forcing us to consider that the time of
change in its transhistorical essentialism, transcendental, circular or
speculative modes is not simply about history and the evental moments
but also about ruptures and openings for the planetary otherwise. [These
parties build partnerships to generate profits from 'green'
technologies.]{.underline} In this sense, international development
institutions articulate SDGs as projects to re-synchronize the
'openings,' the 'indeterminate,' the 'oppositional' back into racial
capitalist planetary regimes as new sources of value and profits. But
capital's captures are moments of singularity and cannot be mapped
linearly: 'The time of capital's own self-movement is an overall process
in which phases and gradients occasionally come to the surface and then
submerge' (Walker,
[2012](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
p. 57). In conversation with Denise Ferreira da Silva, **[we stretch
this logic to consider the structures of time in relation to value and
determinacy and the ordering of global racial planetary capitalist
regimes. What inheres in this time horizon of capital is a notion of a
'self-determining thing,' the 'very condition of existence and the
determination of value in general']{.underline}** (da Silva,
[2017](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
Moreover, da Silva continues, 'Value is an effect of determinacy'
([2017](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400),
citing Kant). Extrapolating from what she says, we argue that in a
sense, value = time = self-determination. Time or universal time is
conveyed as 'at once finite and transcendent, by figuring history and
life as a progressive unfolding that finds its culmination in the human
condition, as it existed in post-Enlightenment Europe' (da Silva,
[2018](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).
Three onto-epistemological-temporal pillars, 'separability, determinacy,
and sequentiality,' da Silva says, are 'the roots of the problem,'
separating and sequencing 'what is known' and determining how 'finite
organic time already maps \[and should map\] the surface of the earth'
(da Silva,
[2018](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2021.1945400)).

displacement of race in critical security studies\] neil

Security Dialogue's call comes out of a **[wider move to include race in
discussions of international relations]{.underline}**, amid calls **[to
'decolonize' a discipline that has always been at the heart of colonial
power structures]{.underline}** ([Sabaratnam,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)).
Yet, in order to understand **[what is at stake in this
move]{.underline}** to include race in a discipline that formerly seemed
to ignore it, **[we must consider the relationship between Blackness and
the world]{.underline}**, the ontological condition that makes
anti-Blackness inextricable from security. In short, we must realize
that questions of race and racism have always been the ground that
critical security studies stands on. **[The idea that racism can be
isolated and extracted from an academic discipline while its effects are
therapeutically addressed is challenged]{.underline}**
**[by]{.underline}** the weight of **[Afropessimist
scholarship]{.underline}**, critical Black feminist and anti-colonial
thinking. The urge to 'decolonize' academia suggests that coloniality is
a condition that can be uprooted within the university without
addressing the broader anti-Black world that universities are in. Some
prominent decolonial scholars have challengingly argued that
'decolonization is not a metaphor' ([Tuck and Yang,
2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)),
and **[others have suggested the need for pluriversal approaches to
security that allow for inclusion of a multitude of non-Western
ontologies]{.underline}** ([Escobar,
2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)).
However, **[even pluriversal approaches risk retaining parts of the
edifice of modernity without addressing its anti-Black
foundations]{.underline}**, **[leaving open the possibility of
're-enchanting and pluralising]{.underline}** \[international
relations\]' (Rothe, 2019: 9), **[assuming that redemption and
reparation is possible]{.underline}**. The temporality at stake is that
which **[seeks to salvage 'critique' through an imaginary telos of
progress -- learning the lessons and moving onwards, ever opening and
exploring new avenues and new approaches]{.underline}** -- hence **[the
appeal to an ethico-political 'openness' that the making of reparative
politics is held to enable.]{.underline}** This **[attempt to move
'beyond' the problem of 'the spectres of race and racism']{.underline}**
is laudable but, we argue, misguided. **[It is precisely critical
narratives of 'progress' that critical Black studies and Afropessimism
seek to problematize]{.underline}** ([Ray et al.,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)).
**[Rather]{.underline}** than considering **[anti-Blackness as an
epiphenomenon of modernity, a glitch in our system that needs to be
fixed]{.underline}**, **[it may be understood as constitutive of a
modern ontology]{.underline}** ([Wilderson,
2010](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)).
As [Nahum Dimitri Chandler
(2014](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
130) states, 'there is no contemporary discourse that is free or
independent of the itinerary of the concept of race'. **[The existence
of Blackness is ontologically crucial in providing the boundaries of
humanity, in creating the Outside, the Other, that is necessary to
define the inside of modernity, civil society and human
subjectivity]{.underline}** ([Warren,
2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)).
As [Saidiya Hartman
(2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
33) argues, '**[the texture of freedom is laden with the vestiges of
slavery, and abstract equality is utterly enmeshed in the narrative of
black subjection']{.underline}**. Thus, for Afropessimists, it **[is not
merely the contemporary order of humanity that is enmeshed with
anti-Blackness]{.underline}**, **[but]{.underline}** also
**[the]{.underline}** **[struggles for emancipation by those within that
order]{.underline}**. This does not mean that there is no oppression
among those who are recognized as human, but that their struggles for
freedom within this space are of a different order from that of Black
people, as the space of these internal conflicts is constituted by
anti-Blackness. In order for there to be security for humanity, in order
for the liberal subject, civil society and a world of progress to
function, Blackness must remain outside, as the counterpoint to the
telos of modernity. This **[throws into question calls for inclusion,
for justice and for reparation]{.underline}**, **[as well as the ability
for the global system to be accountable for the suffering and death of
Black people]{.underline}**. If anti-Blackness is a structural necessity
for the system to exist**[, then there can be no justice, no end to
violence against Black people if the current system
persists.]{.underline}** The drive to include Black people in civil
society, to promote multiculturalism, diversity and inclusion, **[leaves
untouched the ontological condition of Blackness, which is required to
maintain the borders of humanity]{.underline}**. The radical force of
**[Black liberation movements was blunted by the drive to assimilate
them, to include Black people in the political sphere, to recognize and
celebrate their 'ethnic identity', without addressing the fundamental
condition of Blackness]{.underline}**. In the USA, anti-Black violence
remains a necessity to maintain security, despite the inclusion of Black
people at all levels of government. Inclusivity does not ameliorate the
problem; it merely obfuscates it. As [Frank Wilderson
(2010](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
103) argues, **['few characters aestheticize White supremacy more
effectively and persuasively than a Black male cop']{.underline}**.
American governance is not 'haunted' by race, it is constituted through
race. Thus the line between humanity and Blackness is not shattered
through the inclusion of some Black people in the space of civil
society; rather, it is reinforced. In South Africa, the Black
inhabitants of townships continue to endure state violence and poverty
despite the formal end of apartheid. Black activists now protest against
their government by 'black boers' (settlers), those who have crossed the
line into humanity only to fortify it against their former compatriots
([Madlingozi,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)).
This is because, as [Tsepho Madlingozi
(2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
14) argues, 'the main edifice of the ontological structure of
colonial-apartheid . . . remains in place'. In order to ensure the
security of settler society, those few who have been inducted into it
must maintain the violence of the anti-Black order that is said to be
overturned. **[Security, then, is sustained through
anti-Blackness]{.underline}**, for if the abject non-subject of the
Black experience does not exist as a point of contrast, then humanity
cannot be safe. The subjectivity of the (non-Black) human is imperilled,
without the safety of anti-Black violence that ensures its ontological
integrity. If this is the case, then we must re-read the call to bring
considerations of race and racism into critical security studies and
question the feasibility of achieving an ethico-political reparation in
a discipline that relies on the structure of an anti-Black system.
Disavowal: 'Spectres' and 'foundations' Having grasped the nature of the
relationship between anti-Blackness and security, let us reflect on the
assumptions underpinning the desire to rejuvenate the criticality of the
field through reparative approaches to race. We see a potential problem
with the argument that the recent important work by the scholars
like [Sabaratnam
(2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413) and [Rutazibwa
(2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413) on
**[security's racial underpinnings has cleared the ground for a project
of accounting and reparation while maintaining existing academic fields
recognizably intac]{.underline}**t. Indeed, recent work on race in
security and global politics has highlighted many potential issues,
demonstrating the substantial challenge facing reparative projects.
As [Anna Agathangelou and Kyle Killian
(2016)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413) demonstrate,
considered ontologically, coloniality is much more than a set of space-
and time-specific policy practices, but rather a world-making (and
worlds-destroying) practice through which our understanding of global
space and time is constructed (see also [Grovogui,
2014](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413); [Jackson,
2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413); [Silva,
2007](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)).
Moreover, critical sociological accounts of security and international
relations argue that the imposition of racial difference is intimately
tied to colonial and settler-colonial power as a technique of control
and regulation that naturalizes and reproduces differential powers and
capacities (e.g. [Henderson,
2013](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413); [Nisancioglu,
2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)).
**[Race and white supremacy are thus inextricable from hegemonic regimes
of power and imposition, at the heart of the discipline, despite the
abstract categories of liberal political theory that structurally
operate to occlude the centrality of race to contemporary political
divisions and understandings.]{.underline}** As [Gurminder Bhambra
argues
(2017)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413),
the location of race is often displaced -- to claims to identity and
difference, seen to be racial -- while white-coded framings of
'sovereignty' and 'class' obscure their racialized grounding. T**[his
important work on the nature of race and racism in security studies
shows that the problem is not so much one of a lack of incorporation of
questions of race and racism, but rather that of a thoroughgoing
saturation in issues of race]{.underline}**. **[This ontological
saturation implies that there can be no definitive temporal break
between the colonial past and a postcolonial present.]{.underline}**
**[Coloniality remains]{.underline}** in the present not only in
residue, but rather **[as an 'ongoing and quotidian
atrocity']{.underline}**, inevitably problematizing attempts at
reparation (see discussion in [Sharpe,
2016](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
20). We are thereby fully sympathetic to [Howell and Richter-Montpetit's
(2019)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413) understanding
that 'questions of race and racism' cannot be disentangled from critical
security studies or, for that matter, the broader field of international
relations. As [Jared Sexton
(2008](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
22) powerfully notes, **[any attempt to separate 'questions of race and
racism' from systems, structures and institutions of power already risks
disavowing the centrality of race and its reduction to a secondary or
contingent aspect.]{.underline}**

a CIPS postdoctoral fellow (2020-2022) for the Changing Orders project.
Farai has a PhD in Political Science from Queen Mary University of
London. His thesis research investigated the relationship between
international development donors and local civil society organisations
in Zimbabwe, focusing \[A call for abolition: The disavowal and
displacement of race in critical security studies\] neil

We have seen above that **[disavowal operates on the basis of
stipulating that the problem of race and racism is one that can be
located in the past, intimating that the problem is a difficult one of
'spectres' or legacies that must and can be overcome]{.underline}**.
This is possible **[because the assumption is that questions of race are
somehow separable from the field of critical security studies itself,
rather than constitutive of i]{.underline}**t. The successful
**[accomplishment of disavowal, then, enables a focus upon how critical
security studies might move forwa]{.underline}**rd. This leap, we argue,
is a displacement that then puts questions of the future of critical
security studies at the forefront of concern. **[The displacement
accomplishes the inversing of the problematic: critical security studies
is now the solution rather than the problem.]{.underline}** The
precondition for reparative work is the disavowal that race and racism
are inextricably entangled with critical security studies. The shift of
displacement **[is the move to reparation, the imaginary of an anti- or
non-racist critical security studies]{.underline}**.

The problem with this move of displacement is that the ethico-political
stance of reparation is necessarily an affirmative one. As [Eve Kosofsky
Sedgwick
(2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
150--151) suggests, it is through this displacement that we can learn
from the 'ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance
from the objects of a culture -- even of a culture whose avowed desire
has often been not to sustain them'. As Tiffany Lethabo King powerfully
argues, while it is the case that reading 'for what is generative and
provides openings' ([King,
2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
230n74) is vital for coalition and collaboration, reparative work
advocated in LGBT and queer theory presupposes the positionality of a
shared humanist sexual subject position. As [Fred Moten
(2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
11--12) notes in his essay on race and the work of Levinas, the
reparative stance of being 'open to the world' or 'available to the
world' **[can only work as a critical project for those for whom the
world is accessible in these ways]{.underline}**. **[For those
structurally excluded from this political ontology of the
subject]{.underline}**, this **[openness would be critical only insofar
as relationality is understood]{.underline}** to be an expression of
power, **[structured by the givenness of a transcendental subjectivity
that the black cannot have]{.underline}** but by which the black can be
had; **[a structural position that he or she cannot take]{.underline}**
but by which he or she can be taken. ([Moten,
2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
204)

Any project of reparative work for generative ethico-political openings
**[would have to be undertaken after the abolition or dismantling of
critical security studies]{.underline}**, **[not as a substitute for
this, displacing the problem to that of the repair of the disciplinary
field]{.underline}**.

Reparative work proffered from within a system where race is not merely
the 'oil' in the engine but the engine itself offers little hope of real
change. How can critical security studies offer a space for a new
antiracist political ethics, from within the wider 'prison of colonial
modernity' ([Blaney and Tickner,
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413))?
Surely, if reparative work is to be undertaken, **[it should be carried
out on the terms of those who are wronged, rather than on the grounds of
the perpetrator of the offence]{.underline}**. If **[critical security
studies exists on the ground of the 'human']{.underline}**, as a science
of the humanity from which Blackness has always been excluded, then
**[it cannot ameliorate the oppression that was required to clear that
ground]{.underline}** ([Wynter,
2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413)).
Instead, we might follow [Alexander Weheliye
(2014](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
137) in arguing that humanity, the idea of the 'human', can only be
overhauled from without, transformed by those who, he argues, 'live
behind the veil of the permanent state of exception'. Thus, we might
argue that reparation ultimately leads us back to subjection
(see [Coulthard,
2007](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
453).

'**[Questions of race and racism' are not the spectre haunting critical
security studies, they are its life blood, its arteries and the muscles
that power it.]{.underline}** Critical security studies can have no
reparative access to 'questions of race and racism' no matter how hard
or how genuinely it tries. '**[Questions of race and racism' are what
enable the cuts and binaries, the world, the subjects, the concerns, the
practices, the methods, the understandings of critical security
studies]{.underline}**. Critical. Security. Studies. What is it about
these three words, singularly, together, in whatever order, that could
make anyone think, in today's world, there was a way beyond their
imbrications in 'questions of race and racism'? Critical of what? On
what grounds? Security of what? On what grounds? Study of what? On what
grounds? Answer: the grounds of anti-Blackness or 'questions of race and
racism'.

Being critical necessitates having a standpoint, being a subject in
relation. For the white world of modernity, critical standpoints enabled
the overturning of the relation, freeing the subject from its
oppression, alienation or exploitation. As [Frank B. Wilderson
(2010](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024413):
37) notes, **[these 'grammars of suffering' are grounded upon
anti-Blackness, grounded upon the construction of the human as an
abstract, autonomous, interest-bearing, rational subject]{.underline}**.
Wilderson argues that the exclusion of Blackness from humanity was
required as a counterpart, an outside that allowed for the construction
of the modern human subject. Thus, **[critique, in the sense of striving
for emancipation under the conditions of modernity, is ontologically
grounded in anti-Blackness]{.underline}**. For '**[critique', then,
'questions of race and racism' are problems of management and damage
limitation, problems of experience not problems of
ontology]{.underline}**. **[Addressing 'questions of race and racism' is
the form that governance takes, the practice of grounding this
governance itself. Critique is what puts anti-Blackness to work in its
ceaseless desire to reproduce itself, to improve, to better, to be more
adaptive, to be more inclusive -- ever changing, ever learning, ever
transforming]{.underline}**. Therefore, the mere inclusion of questions
of race and racism, which maintain the ontological structure of
anti-Blackness, must perpetuate an anti-Black world. Critique is **[the
endless search for the emancipation of the huma]{.underline}**n, the
quest for the realization of the full potential of an anti-Black world.
The flight of critique today can be rewritten as **[the perpetual denial
of and war on Blackness]{.underline}**, that which enables **[and 'makes
invisible' its]{.underline}** grounds of **[violence]{.underline}**.

Samuel A. Chambers defines the imagination as a "synthetic power of
creation and re-creation---an ability to combine the uncombinable, to
surpass binaries without merely collapsing them, to fashion something
new" (620). **[And from such synthesis, we are told that a democratic
imagination is possible, since we would "think the limits (and their
transgression) of democratic theory and of democracy as
well]{.underline}**" (620). Here, we see that the **[democratic
imagination recasts limits as possibilities rather than complete
failures. Limits become the resource for creation and re-creation rather
than evidence of destruction and uselessness]{.underline}**. A couture
Kantianism / Hegelianism (mixed with a splash of deconstruction)
**[salvages democracy from the perils of its absurdity, devastation, and
brutality]{.underline}**. **[Why]{.underline}** this **[investment in
democracy's "intrinsic" creative power]{.underline}**? **[Can this
creativity finally bring an end to anti-Black violence and Black
suffering]{.underline}**? Or is the knowledge of democracy's
fabulousness enough to sustain Blacks through police terrorism,
environmental racism, re-enslavement through incarceration, and food /
housing insecurity and discrimination? I would suggest that what makes
such creative synthesis possible is an unacknowledged dependence on
time. For proponents of democracy**[, it is time that is malleable for
creative enterprises of re-imagination, of progress fetishization, and
an "ontology of change" that need not justify (or prove) itself,
declaration of change seems to be enough]{.underline}** (Badiou,
"Ontology"). What if, however, democracy is clinging to a depleted
resource**[? What if time is no longer enough to orient existence,
especially for those inhabitants of an abyss---within which time, space,
ethics, and law are weaponized against existence? Put somewhat
differently, democracy has exhausted the imagination]{.underline}**. It
is a **[speculative vampire that drains the imagination of any vital
resource for its own survival. This speculation is an outrageous
expenditure of energy, an enjoyment without end, a scholarly
surplus-pleasure requiring an incessant (and useless) political
repetition]{.underline}** (Johnston). I would describe this
speculation---the conjoining of time, democracy, and the
imagination---as an interminable quest, or a certain "stuckness" in a
scene of failure (a constant encircling of political and legal vacuity).
This repetition is most dramatically demonstrated, for me, in **[Black
political participation---voting, protesting, keeping hope alive,
returning to the kernel of authoritarian violence (i. e.,
anti-Blackness) with unbridled hope, temporal determination, and an
investment in the ontology of change]{.underline}** (Warren; Farred).
**[Time mocks Blacks, requiring historical déjà vu to be re-imagined,
redeemed, rethought, or ignored, rather than accepting time as
anti-Black enmity and democracy as the Abandoning Time: Black Nihilism
and the Democratic Imagination]{.underline}** Amst 66.1 (2021): 247-51
249 permanence of anti-Blackness. Chants of "yes we can!" "your vote
matters!" "we have power!" "we're moving forward," etc., serve to
**[neglect the failure of Black political participation and to imprison
the imagination within futurity]{.underline}**. As I am writing these
remarks, I am witnessing the absurdity of this democratic imagination
and its unrelenting time. On one news program, I hear that police shot
unarmed Andre Hill, a forty-seven-yearold Black resident of Columbus,
Ohio, without cause, and rather than offering him medical assistance,
decided to handcuff him (just in case the supine, dying man finds a gun,
magically, I guess). On the other news program, I hear Black politicians
importuning, begging, and guilting Blacks into voting for change. Black
political pundits assure voters that the ontology of change is
realizable if you just exercise your right to vote. "Never again!" "We
will transform police practices!" "This time will be different!" Did
Blacks not vote when police shot twelve-year-old Tamir Rice as he was
playing with his toy gun on the playground? (By the way, no federal
charges will be brought against the police officers who shot him). Did
Blacks not vote when Sandra Bland lost her life in police custody? Did
Blacks not vote after police deprived Eric Garner and George Floyd (and
apparently 70 other people) of breath (Baker et al.)? In answer to my
inquiry "why should we continue to vote if anti-Black violence is not
changing?" I am told, "Just keep believing, we can vote people in that
can change things!" When I then ask, "But I voted for President Obama
(suspending my nihilism in an intoxication of hopeaffect), I thought
things were going to change for Blacks? I feel just as unsafe and
endangered post-Obama as pre-Obama," I am told, "Obama wasn't a 'magic
Negro.' He did the best he could." Then I ask, "So why vote if it will
take an act of magic to address the existential threat of
anti-Blackness?" **[Time mocks the cyclical movement of such inquiries,
they are, indeed, unanswerable within the creative, synthetic, and
powerful democratic horizon]{.underline}**. Voting **[becomes the
premier instrument of the democratic imagination---supposedly, it
activates the imagination with futurity, avoids paralysis with action,
and can be repeated. What type of creativity will finally eradicate
anti-Black brutality]{.underline}**? And could such creativity even
operate within time**[? Could we still call such creativity democracy?
Must we abandon time to enable the imagination to perform the mystical,
the magical, and the ineffable?]{.underline}**

Patrick ,PhD thesis, London School of Economics and Political Science)

The **[discourses of Africans and people of African
descent]{.underline}**, which ultimately helped bring about the end of
formal empire in Africa and the Caribbean, took place during a
particularly important moment in the formation of 'the international.'
62 While the first and second waves of decolonisation comprised similar
dynamics of empire-colony relations, and the internal divergences within
colonised societies, the third wave of decolonisation came as the result
of a uniquely global discourse around the role of imperialism in the
First World War, **[the threat this represented to 'world civilisation',
and the new forms of international governance and social relations
needed to address global conflict. During this moment, empire came to be
seen as in need of reform by some, and inherently destructive and
regressive by others]{.underline}**. In each case, the emergence of more
powerful and organised racial advocacy networks and the **[depreciating
returns of white imperial legitimacy galvanised arguments for non-white
inclusion in governance.]{.underline}** **[Objection to white supremacy
proliferated in various transnational advocacy organizations and through
colonial and metropolitan print cultures]{.underline}**. These ideas
were facilitated by the synchronisation of racial grievance throughout
colonised populations, but also by the ideological and organisational
resources supplied by the COMINTERN and the United States. Black
anti-imperialism is not reducible to Soviet communism or American
liberalism, but its entanglements with other political movements often
led to important consequences, such as the crackdown on its print
materials and organising by colonial authorities.63 **[The focus on
black internationalism also has a rationale related to the relative
neglect of certain discourses and ideologies in the formation of the
international/states system]{.underline}**. While it would be possible
to dig deeper into the **[anti-imperial politics of white metropolitan
activists, the view that independence was gifted to the colonies by
benevolent whites does not need further elaboration.]{.underline}** The
notion that white **[Western societies came around on their own to new
moral positions on practices like colonialism already forms the bedrock
for a plethora of liberal constructivist studies]{.underline}** and
popular histories.64 Analysis of the world political discourse of
individuals like Marcus Garvey, Cyril Briggs, J.E. and Adelaide Casely
Hayford, Paulette Nardal, George Padmore, among others, forms part of
the unique contribution of this study. Although they usually referred to
peasant and worker communities, the discourses I analyse here were
relatively elite. However, **[there is more in the history of
anti-imperial, intra-elite discourse than has been sometimes suggested
by historians of the subaltern. Excluded socially and
politically]{.underline}**, but rich in cultural capital, sufficiently
resourced to travel between colony and metropole, and tailored towards
low level, white collar professions, many anti-imperial writers and
leaders were acutely aware of the transnational pecking order, and
occupied a position of relative subalternity. For the most part, these
individuals fit Edward Said's category of the 'secular intellectual.'65
Said defines secular intellectuals by six axes of activity and thought:
1.) the 'archival function' of preserving and deploying
'counterinformation' which is hidden by the 'prevailing consensus'; 2.)
translating specialized knowledge and literature into forms accessible
to broad groups of people; 3.) demystifying the language of authority
which appeals to so-called pragmatic common-sense in order to highlight
the underlying ethical or political implications; 4.) disrupting
attempts to privatize knowledge by challenging the boundaries of
specialized domains of practice; 5.) resisting a culture's slide into
total domination or trivialization; and 6.) insisting on the
irreconcilability and irreducibility of oppositions.66 In Antonio
Gramsci's problematic and the European context, such figures would
normally be considered intellectuals proper, the 'organizers of culture'
contrasted with the 'organic intellectuals' who derive their ideology
from the 'essential task of economic production.'67 But the relative
marginality of colonial anti-imperial activists created a unique
position where the function of intellectual critique often needed to be
exercised outside the realms of formal knowledge production---in the
function rooms and public parks of metropolitan centres, through art and
literature, and in transnational print media **[Through its empirics and
approach this study seeks to contribute to the '(re)turn' to empire and
race in IR]{.underline}**.69 A few scholars now recognise that analysis
of contemporary international relations, whether it concerns Brexit;
**[Russian, Chinese, and Western rivalry in Africa; NATO operations in
the Middle Eas]{.underline}**t; Salafist movements; **[transnational
protest movements like Black Lives Matter]{.underline}**; or
developments in organisations like CARICOM, the African Union, or ASEAN,
**[is often poorer for not attending to legacies of empire and
colonialism, as well as ongoing imperial relations. Critical histories
of IR have pointed to IR as an academic discipline which got its start
through the policy science of race development and imperial
management]{.underline}**70; which continues to advance self-flattering
myths about Western exceptionalism; and which claims or assumes the
universality of European history, institutions, and technologies. This
can have the effect of whitewashing Euro-American world politics, or,
more insidiously, continuing to normalise state-sanctioned violence and
inequality. **[71 These critiques of IR as a Eurocentric discipline,
historically bound up with white supremacy, have carried the discipline
to a crossroads]{.underline}**. Down one road, **[there is the
possibility of attempting to address these omissions and biases with
analysis based in liberal pluralist inclusion: adding a host of
'non-Western' categories and biases, which posit cultural and
territorialised particularities]{.underline}**. **[I argue that the
likely outcome here is not an amelioration of Eurocentrism, but an
extension of it. The West is still granted the terrain of the universal,
with 'the non-West' granted tolerance to tack on a variety of cultural
'differences']{.underline}**, as long as it largely continues to adhere
to disciplinary shibboleths, such as order, sovereignty, and
recognition. **[Another path -- though not the only one \-- is the
relational-historical approach to empire and race I put forward in this
study. This understands relations between former empires and colonies as
asymmetrical and differentiated but connected, constituted through
resistance and alliance as well as oppression]{.underline}**, and
interpretable through discourse, which often concerned bounded
communities, but was usually also boundary-crossing.

[Predictive analytics use a variety of techniques (e.g., statistical
methods, machine learning algorithms) **to make predictions about future
events**. Although predictive analytics have been used in many
disciplines since the early 20th century (e.g., actuarial science,
business intelligence, financial forecasting), increasingly, this
computationally intensive technique has been employed by law enforcement
and other government agencies to generate predictions about future
criminal behavior.]{.underline} While the function of predictive
analytics in policing [appears]{.underline} to be [well
intentioned]{.underline}, upon a closer examination, one may find that
the decisions generated by 'black\--box' modeling techniques like
supervised machine learning [encourage a 'blind faith']{.underline} in
the mathematical process and [in]{.underline} the [ability]{.underline}
of algorithms [to produce]{.underline} meaningful and informative
[predictions]{.underline}. Thus, despite their widespread use,
predictive policing tools are complex systems with many aspects that
remain a mystery. In this paper, we critically [examine the employment
of predictive analytics in US criminal justice policy]{.underline}, with
a particular focus on the ways in which these [technological practices
are reproducing and reinforcing structural relations of
differenc]{.underline}e. We are specifically motivated by the following
questions: In what ways do the algorithms become part of a larger
sociotechnical apparatus of sociopolitical relations? [How are the data
that the algorithms inherit alwaysalready imbued with structural
relations of difference? To what extent do algorithms predict or
performatively enact differential patterns of sentencing decisions or
recidivism? In what ways might bodies, spaces, and practices be
materially formed and shaped from the performative acts of algorithmic
legal reasoning?]{.underline} And, in what ways might the [**cloaking of
algorithmic legal reasoning as objective, precise, and efficient enable
the proliferation of racializing assemblages in the juridical
field**?]{.underline} Each of these motivating questions will be
examined through a new materialist lens that [posits algorithms as
more\--thanhuman ontologies and racializing assemblages.]{.underline} As
argued by the first author elsewhere, we need to move beyond the
dominant tendency to treat algorithms as mechanical operations that are
contingent on human intervention or design and, as such, a prosthetic
tool to human cognition. The concept of algo\--ritmo reconceptualizes
the algorithm as 1 2 3 4 D\-- 3/41 engaging in more\--than\--human
performative acts that are produced from the immanent forms of what
Luciana Parisi refers to as the "soft" thought of algorithmic reasoning.
As a concept, [algo\--ritmo not only accounts theoretically for how the
more\--than\--human performative acts of algorithms function but also
considers the ways in which those algorithmic acts are forming, shaping,
hierarchizing, and differentiating bodies.]{.underline} Thus,
[algo\--ritmo also refers to the ways in which algorithms become
racializing assemblages**.**]{.underline} As articulated by Alex
Weheliye, racializing assemblages are a system of sociopolitical
relations that hierarchizes and differentiates bodies, designating
bodies as human, notquite\--human, and nonhuman; rendering certain
bodies as exceptional and others as disposable. Algo\--ritmo postulates
that the bodily disciplining is both human and more\--than\--hum an.
Thus, there are not just human bodies that are racialized but algorithms
too. In other words, we argue that inside of the proverbial "black [box"
, algorithms become immanent agencies of racializing
assemblages.]{.underline} By doing a close reading of policy documents
and existing research literature, we critically [examine the racializing
assemblages]{.underline} of [algorithmic law]{.underline} enforcement
[logic, policies and practices, followed by ethical and social policy
considerations.]{.underline} We begin by discussing the literature on
big data and the rise of predictive policing. Policing Crime &
Predictive Analytics Big Data & The Rise of Predictive Policing In
recent years, the [private sector and government]{.underline} have
focused their efforts on [harnessing the power of]{.underline} big
[data]{.underline} [to find]{.underline} meaningful
[patterns]{.underline} and [make]{.underline} [datadriven decisions**.
Private corporations** such as Target and Walmart have analyzed their
customer data to inform marketing strategies and product sales and
placement. **Government agencies are also leveraging big data and
analytics to improve policy decision\--making**]{.underline}. Most
notably, in 2012, the Obama Administration unveiled a Big Data
Initiative, which sought to "improve the tools and techniques needed to
access, organize, and glean discoveries from huge volumes of digital
data." Arguably, where there have been even [more
advancements]{.underline} on these fronts has been [in local city
governance and institutional practices.]{.underline} While many
government institutions have turned to big data [analytics]{.underline}
[to make more "intelligent" decisions, law enforcement and criminal
justice have emerged as two of the most prevalent areas in which these
techniques have been developed and applied.]{.underline} 5 6 7 8 9 10
D\-- 4/41 Policing Bodies Numerically Before delving into the use of
analytics in policing, it is important to understand the history of the
use of statistics and numbers more broadly in criminal justice research.
[Prediction and forecasting]{.underline} have been used for nearly a
century to study crime in the U.S. While much of this research has been
focused on studying criminal behavior , other work has [used forecasting
methods to predict trends in crime and prison populations]{.underline}.
That said, no matter the outcome, criminal justice researchers have long
been obsessed with using data ---and in particular quantitative
data---to understand crime. One prevailing belief is that, culturally
speaking, the predominance of quantitative methods in criminal justice
research reflects a broader societal notion about what it means to do
science, and in this context it should not be surprising that to do
science requires the manipulation and calculation of numbers. [The act
of defining and explaining social phenomena using numbers or
quantitative data is nothing new]{.underline}. In fact, this phenomenon
has its roots in positivism. Positivism refers to the philosophical
writings (circa 1830\--1842) of Auguste Comte in which the scientific
method---the standard procedure for gaining and producing knowledge in
the natural sciences---was applied to the study of human behavior and
social phenomena. According to Comte, there are three premises of
positivism: 1. Universal truths exist for human behavior and social
phenomena. 2. Empirical observation is the only rational means by which
universal truths in the social world can be discovered. 3. [Through the
application of the scientific method, causal relationships among social
phenomena can be established]{.underline} Imbued within positivist
philosophy is the notion that truth cannot only be discovered but also
replicated through (precise and certain) scientific measurement. It was
through the application of positivism to the study of the human
condition and social life that quantification and the scientific method
become central features of social and behavioral science and the
preferred ways of understanding populations. While the rise of
positivism led to the growing use of quantitative methods in the human
sciences, why were these methods so readily and widely accepted? 11 12
13 14 15 D\-- 5/41 Theodore Porter in his seminal work Trust in Numbers
historically traces the rise of objective empiricism and ubiquity of
quantification in the modern world. To Porter, and largely society as a
whole, we are drawn to numbers not only because they can be used to
describe social phenomena, but also because a decision 'made' by numbers
appears impartial and indisputable. [This notion of numbers as 'truth'
is rooted in the belief that mathematics is the language and logic of
the natural world. When applied to the study of human and social life,
however, in what ways and to what extent do numbers become political and
reflect the normative assumptions about what is counted, how it is
counted, and why it is counted]{.underline}? This critical question is
at the heart of Porter's work, and through the use of historical case
studies he demonstrates that numbers are never void of subjectivity or
judgment. [Rather]{.underline}, [numbers]{.underline} are ["strategies
of communication" that are used to legitimize one's actions and "provide
standards against which \[to measure progress and compare
information\]." In this way, numbers become "an agency for acting on
people \[and\] exercising power over them]{.underline}." If we build off
Porter's claim about the nature of numbers and take seriously the
proposition that numbers are capable of exerting power, then we must
consider the possibility that [numbers, which can describe the social
world, can just as easily be used to control it]{.underline}. Michel
Foucault takes up this subject in many of his works, and characterizes
discipline as a mode of power that "[separates, analyses,
differentiates...measures...and hierarchizes in terms of
value."]{.underline} Importantly, for Foucault, while discipline is
"exercised on the bodies of individuals...the individual is not the
primary datum on which discipline is exercised." Although this statement
may seem paradoxical, it can be explained by examining Foucault's two
lecture series Security, Territory, and Population and Governmentality.
In both works, Foucault provides a historical account of the evolution
of government, and describes how society's transition from feudalism to
capitalism led government to be concerned with the population within its
territory in order to successfully govern the territory over which it
has control. Driving this concern was the desire to organize, optimize,
and regulate state affairs. This, of course, required the collection of
data from individuals, while privileging quantified population trends.
Viewed through a Foucauldian lens, then, [methods of quantification such
as statistics are a means through which the state controls, categorizes,
and classifies its citizens.]{.underline} [The Rise of the Carceral
State]{.underline} 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 D\-- 6/41 If statistics and
numbers have had historical significance in criminal justice research,
then we must inquire about the role they have played in policing bodies
in the U.S. In particular, we ask how have [numbers shaped policing and
legitimized mass incarceration]{.underline}? We contend that the origins
of mass incarceration in the U.S. can be traced to the Johnson era's War
on Poverty. When Lyndon B. Johnson assumed the presidency, he not only
vowed to enforce civil rights, but he also declared war on poverty.
After a few years in office, however, what began as a commitment to
nationwide anti\--poverty programs quickly turned into something more
sinister---namely, an agenda to target and punish urban, black
communities across America. In 1965, Daniel Moynihan, a politician and
sociologist, released a report titled The Negro Family: The Case for
National Action. In the report, Moynihan used employment data to
identify the causes of poverty and social\--ill (e.g., crime,
corruption) in the U.S. Often citing dire statistics to shock the reader
(e.g. "Almost One\--Fourth of Negro Families are Headed by Females"),
Moynihan's report largely painted the poverty problem in the U.S. as a
"negro problem" rooted in the disintegration of the black nuclear
family. Though President Johnson would come to distance himself from the
blatantly racist report authored by Moynihan, by the end of his term in
office, the damage had already been done. The carefully crafted
communication strategy embedded within Moynihan's report had
[legitimized the government's desire to control the "negro
problem]{.underline}," and culminated in the Omnibus Crime Control and
Safe Streets Act of 1968. Crime & Carceral State The Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 signaled a profound shift in the
government's attitude and response to the root causes and correlates of
crime. The Act enabled the federal government to provide financial
assistance to local law enforcement agencies for the procurement of
police equipment and laid the foundation for massive federal investments
in crime control and prevention strategies. More importantly, however,
the Act expanded the federal government's (e.g., Department of Justice)
role in local law enforcement and criminal justice matters, with the
goal of creating an interconnected, coordinated system for the provision
of justice and crime 24 25 26 27 28 D\-- 7/41 prevention. Ultimately,
the Crime Control and Safe Streets Act represented a major step by the
government to federalize crime and codified the prioritization of law
enforcement over welfare as a means to address social problems. Less
than a decade after President Johnson signed the Omnibus Crime Control
and Safe Streets Act into Law, and after decades of stability in the
rates of incarceration, the U.S. began to experience substantial growth
in its prison population, a trend that has yet to be reversed. By the
late 1960s, fear of rising urban crime and drug related activities,
coupled with social and political unrest, fueled bilateral support for
the United States' punitive approach to law and order. This support
translated into harsher punishments for minor offenses and mandatory
minimum sentences and, ultimately, resulted in extraordinarily high
rates of incarceration after 1970. According to estimates published by
the Bureau of Justice Statistics, approximately 500,000 people were
incarcerated in 1980. By 2000, however, the total incarcerated
population had exploded to more than 1.9 million. Though the shift
towards tougher penal policies exerted a significant influence on
national incarceration rates, time trends show that growth in
incarceration in the U.S. has not been uniform across offenses or
offenders. It is commonly recognized that the War on Drugs has
contributed to the rise in incarceration rates over the last 40 years.
Thus, it should come as no surprise that drug offenses over time have
begun to comprise a disproportionate share of arrests and prison
admissions. Figure 1 shows the time trends from 1980 to 2012 in the rate
of arrests for select crimes. The most striking pattern revealed in the
figure is the sharp increase in the rate of arrests for drug abuse
violations compared to arrests for other criminal offenses.
Specifically, over the 32 years for which we have data, arrests for drug
related offenses rose from 255.65 per 100,000 persons in 1980 to just
under 500 per 100,000 in 2012, peaking at 633.25 per 100,000 persons in
2006. An examination of incarceration rates over the same period shows a
similar pattern, where in 1980 the incarceration rate for a drug related
offense was 15 per 100,000 persons, but by 2000, that rate had increased
over tenfold to more than 150 per 100,000. 29 30 31 32 33 D\-- 8/41

surface, the movement toward punitive crime control in the U.S. appeared
to be broad and far\--reaching. When disaggregated by race, however, the
data present a more troubling picture. Despite comprising less than 12%
of the U.S. population in 1980, African Americans made up 44% of the
total amount of state and federal inmates in the same year. By 2000, the
population of African Americans in the U.S. had increased to 12.9%, and
yet they accounted for 46% of all inmates in U.S. state and federal
correctional facilities. In the end, the U.S.' policy of mass
incarceration not only led to an overrepresentation of African Americans
in jails and prisons, but it also reflects a clear policy choice to
inscribe race into the criminal justice system. Perhaps John Ehrlichman,
a former Nixon domestic policy chief, best expresses these sentiments:
34 35 D\-- 9/41 "You want to know what this was really all about...The
Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two
enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm
saying. We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war
or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with
marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily,
we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid
their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night
on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of
course we did." Policing in the Information Age Today, across the U.S.,
dozens of police departments, from Boston to Los Angeles, have turned to
sophisticated data analytics to address criminal justice practices.
Although the use of quantitative data to address crime is not novel,
newer technologies fueled by algorithms, artificial intelligence, and
machine learning enable [law enforcement agencies to harness the power
of big data to predict criminal behavior. This strategy is often
referred to as predictive policing.]{.underline} We adopt our definition
of predictive policing from the RAND Corporation and National Institute
of Justice. They define predictive policing as the "the application of
analytical techniques---particularly quantitative techniques---to
identify likely targets for police intervention and prevent crime or
solve past crimes by making statistical predictions." [Predictive
policing and its tools permit law enforcement to use data to predict
where crime is most likely to happen; assess who is most likely to
(re)offend or be victimized; and form typologies of
offenders.]{.underline} While the goals of predictive policing may be
clear, what remains muddied is what they are doing to accomplish these
goals. However, before we can examine what predictive policing tools are
doing, we must have a better understanding of some of the keywords that
are often used when discussing the subject, namely, artificial
intelligence, supervised machine learning, and algorithm. Artificial
intelligence is an umbrella term used to describe the science and
engineering of creating machines and/or software with the ability to
achieve a goal. , Nested within AI is supervised machine learning.
Supervised machine learning, as a branch of AI, is concerned with using
historical information (i.e., a dataset that includes known input (x)
and output (y) data) to train a model that can be used to predict future
events (or 36 37 38 39 40 41 D\-- 10/41 behavior). An algorithm, on the
other hand, can be defined as a list of instructions for a
step\--by\--step execution of a specific task. Supervised machine
learning algorithms, then, are computer programs that not only try to
achieve a specific goal (e.g., predict the likelihood of crime in
location Y) but also are capable of improving (or maintaining) their
performance in service to that goal when fed new input data As Foster
and colleagues note: "One key distinction in \[supervised\] machine
learning is that the goal is not just to find the best function F that
can predict Y for observed outcomes (known Ys) but to find one that best
generalizes to new, unseen data." Machine learning algorithms have been
applied to a variety of criminal justice contexts. These algorithms can
be used at all stages of the criminal justice process, from determining
where to deploy police officers for maximum impact , to informing bail
decisions (also known as pretrial risk assessment) , to assessing risk
for recidivating among parolees and probationers. Police departments and
other branches of the criminal justice system in cities around the
country have adopted these tools, drawing on both researchers and
university\--based partnerships, as well as proprietary software, to
develop and implement the desired algorithmic tools. One widely known
proprietary tool, PredPol, is the product of a research partnership
between UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, and the Los Angeles Police Department.
According to their website, "PredPol's mission is to provide a crime
prevention platform to keep communities safer. Our...technology places
public safety officers at the right time and location to give them the
best chance of preventing crime." Using machine learning techniques,
PredPol claims to be able to predict where crime is most likely to occur
using only three data points: "crime type, crime location, and crime
date and time." Another example is the COMPAS tool produced by
Northpointe, which applies machine learning algorithms to risk
assessment at the levels of policing and case management, promising
users both a "prospective" and "retrospective look at risk and needs
factors." Yet despite widespread use of these algorithms, touted as
powerful and technologically advanced methods for improving public
safety, their propensity to disproportionately target individuals from
lower\--class neighborhoods and communities of color remains starkly
understudied and underreported outside of popular news media. 41 43 41
41 46 47 48 49 50 51 D\-- 11/41 [Algorithmic Reasoning as Racializing
Assemblages]{.underline} Machine learning algorithms are [being employed
in many sectors of US]{.underline} society [including]{.underline} in
the practices of [pred]{.underline}ictive [pol]{.underline}icing and
criminal justice. Yet, we know less about the ways in which the
[algorithms]{.underline} may become [part]{.underline} [of a
larger]{.underline} [sociotechnical]{.underline} [apparatus]{.underline}
[of sociopolitical relations]{.underline}. In order to examine this, we
put the concept of algo\--ritmo to work in analyzing the algorithmic
legal reasoning of predictive policing. [Algo\--ritmo seeks to account
for both the immanent agencies of algorithmic acts and the ways in which
those acts become racializing assemblages. In conceptually developing an
understanding of how algorithms may become racializing
assemblages]{.underline}, the first author has argued that it is through
the data that the [algorithms inherit sociopolitical relations of
society. Data are not pure, objective extractions of the world but
rather are assemblages that are produced from a multiplicity of entwined
and mutating apparatuses.]{.underline} [The apparatuses of data
assemblages include political economy, forms of knowledge, practices,
governmentalities and legalities, and subjectivities and communities,
among others. As assemblages, they are both materially and discursively
produced from forces of human and more\--than\--human
ontologies]{.underline}. Among the multiplicity of forces that make up
data assemblages [include]{.underline} sociopolitical relations that
consist of [forces that differentiate and hierarchize
bodies]{.underline}. Thus, all assemblages of [data]{.underline} are
always\--already [imbued]{.underline} [with]{.underline} varying degrees
of sociopolitical relations and, as such, become part of the
(re)programmed architectures of algorithmic reasoning. For algo\--ritmo,
algorithmic reasoning is not understood to be mechanical operations that
are contingent on human intervention or design. It is postulated that
the systematic operations of algorithms are not simply humanly designed
and modeled or the prosthetic tool to human cognition. In accordance
with Parisi, algorithms are understood to be actual entities that
consist of finite operations of calculation as well as incomputable data
sequences. As actual entities, [they are sociotechnical ontologies that
are always in process of becoming in relation with **sociopolitical
systems,** **legal practices**, programmed inputs, and data
assemblage]{.underline}s. These are not simply humanly designed
technologies, but rather as algorithms [process and are trained on data
assemblages they become more\--than\--human ontologies.]{.underline} For
Parisi, it is the 52 53 54 D\-- 12/41 actuality of incomputabilities
that provide instantiation of the immanent forms of algorithmic
cognition. That is to say, operating between the space of finite
algorithmic operations and the incomputability of the world's infinite
complexity (i.e., information) are forms of speculative reason that are
immanent to computation. If machine learning algorithms consist of
immanent forms of reasoning[, then **the iterability of predictions or
speech acts** are more\--than\--human performative]{.underline} acts.
[**Performative acts, or intra\--actions, are relational acts within
entangled entities that produce ongoing material (re)configurings of the
world**.]{.underline} Building on Barad's diffractive reading of
Foucault's discursive theory and Butler's theory of performativity via
Bohr's conception of matter, [algo\--ritmo engages in morethan\--human
performative acts, in which materiality is discursive and the discursive
is always\--already materi]{.underline}al. It is [via the iterable
intra\--actions with other relational ontologies that materially
reconfigures the world. Thus, algoritmos matter through their iterable
intra\--actions with other ontologies, whereby they enact, form, shape,
and produce both human and more\--thanhuman bodies. As agencies that
inherit sociopolitical relations via data assemblages, the immanent
forms of reasoning and more\--than\--human performative acts of
algorithms become racializing assemblages.]{.underline} The theory of
[racializing assemblages]{.underline} seeks to more adequately
[account]{.underline} [for]{.underline} the [processes]{.underline} of
[power]{.underline} and [racializations]{.underline} of the [body/flesh.
As argued by Weheliye, racialization is not to be reduced to race or
racism but is the process of differentiation and hierarchization that
produces the assemblages of race, gender, class, sexuality, and
dis/ability among other structural relations of "difference". The
sociopolitical relations of racialization are perpetuated via
technologies and sciences (among other things) and require "the barring
of nonwhite subjects from the category of the human." Thus, the data and
code of algorithms inherit the sociopolitical relations of "difference"
becoming a performative force of the relational and connected forces of
racializing assemblages]{.underline}. As a way of drawing a distinction
between the legal constitution of the body and the social designations
of the flesh, Weheliye also calls upon Hortense Spillers' (2003)
theorizing of the flesh. As Spillers nsightfully states ["before the
'body' there is 'flesh,' that zero degree of social conceptualization
that does not escape]{.underline} [concealment under the brush of
discourse or the reflexes of iconography..."]{.underline} [Prior to the
legal constitution of the body is the formation of the flesh, a
formation that is bound by the markings or traces of political violence
designating a hierarchy of humanity. The traces of political violence of
the flesh are what Spillers refers to as "**hieroglyphics of the flesh"
that are produced from the instruments or acts of violence such as
whips, police brutality, mass shootings, or more subtly from the silence
in speech acts**. The data and code of algorithmic acts inherit the
sociopolitical forces and "hieroglyphics of the flesh" of racializing
assemblages from the iterability of algorithmic
intra\--action]{.underline}s. In this article, we examine the ways in
which [algorithmic legal reasoning]{.underline}, as
[materialized]{.underline} [in]{.underline} practices of [predictive
policing]{.underline}, [becomes racializing assemblages.]{.underline}
[As will be discussed below, sociopolitical relations of racializations
become part of the algorithmic architecture in at least two ways. First
is by way of the rationalities behind the metrics that operationalize
and constitute the criterion of prediction. The second is more
posthumanist via the algorithmic intra\--action with data assemblages
and through this process (re)configuring the architecture of the
algorithm to becoming racializing assemblages. By putting the concept
algo\--ritmo to work in a close reading of the existing research and
policy literature, we illuminate these sociopolitical
processes.]{.underline}

#### Racialized surveillance is a technology of social control that seeps into educational spaces and ensures an endless racial economy of black servitude and placelessness.

Surveillance, according to Browne
([2015](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029)),
is "nothing new for Black people" (p. 7). Evolving from trans-Atlantic
slavery (Hadden,

[**racialized surveillance is a fact of Black life, a social curriculum
that permits the devaluation of Black people**]{.underline} (Callier,
[2018](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029)).
Rather than seeing surveillance as a specific set of processes ushered
in by developing technologies, Browne
([2015](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029))
calls on readers to examine how [antiblackness undergirds and sustains
intersecting surveillances in the present order. Further, anti-Blackness
names the ways **Black people are positioned as inferior in the polity,
and exist in a structurally antagonistic relationship with
society**]{.underline} (Hartman,
[2007](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029)).
In this conceptual manuscript, [anti-Blackness grapples with the
position of Black people as existing in a structurally oppressive
society that persistently denies them access to full citizenship and
regard.]{.underline} Moreover, this manuscript carefully examines
racialized surveillance, a mechanism of anti-Black violence, or what
Hartman
([2007](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029))
has called [the afterlife of slavery, that persists in society despite
the formal end of enslavement.]{.underline} To accomplish this, I
conducted a critical discourse analysis (Fairclough,
[2003](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029))
of an incident in an educational context and one outside the [**walls of
education**, in the larger social context, to **show the ways anti-Black
sentiments have evolved from, but still mirror, the racialized
surveilling logics of trans-Atlantic slavery in the contemporary
moment**.]{.underline} Specifically, this analysis examined the
controversial Starbucks incident that involved a
White[1](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029)
manager calling the police on two Black men, and the experience of
Lolade Siyonbola, who was napping in a commons at Yale University. In
this manuscript, I understand Yale, particularly the commons space, as a
formal learning/meeting space, and Starbucks as an informal
learning/meeting space, both with the potential to host and curate
ideas. Responding to the pressing question, how do we exist, in the
bodies that we hold, in this historical moment and into the future
(Okello,
[2018](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029)),
methodologically, I think with (Jackson & Mazzei,

**instruments of power to interrogate how racialized surveillance
affects Black bodies and minds, in and beyond educational
contexts.**]{.underline} As such, the guiding research question for this
inquiry asked, how does racialized surveillance affect the movements of
Black people in public and educational contexts? From these analyses, I
point to survival and meaning-making techniques that Black people might
employ to navigate racialized surveillance. To begin addressing this
guiding question, I review literature on the presence of Blackness in
the public sphere. Blackness and place in the public sphere: A review of
literature This brief review revisits foundational ideas in Black
studies, and more pointedly, the experiences of Black people in the
western, United States, to illuminate the ways Blackness and
surveillance are connected. To accomplish this, I address the ways
conceptions of Blackness were shaped through trans-Atlantic slavery.
From there, I move to discuss racialized surveillance and explicate
slave patrols as an early iteration of the concept. I conclude by
drawing connections to readings of Black men and Black women in the
public sphere. Linking Blackness and history [The mark of dark skin,
according to Yancy
(]{.underline}[2016](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029)),
[is a signifier of pejorative, poor values anchored in a racialized
historical matrix.]{.underline} According to Frantz Fanon
(1952/[1967](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029)),
[who observed, **not only must Black people be Black, but they must
assume their Blackness in relation to whiteness. Blackness is configured
by its relation and distance to whiteness, which established the
desirable norm. Whiteness, thus, determines what is out of place without
being defined by the same logic**]{.underline}. Concomitantly, as Curry
([2017](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029))
might suggest, (social) death seems to seek out Black people. This
sentiment follows what Hartman
([2007](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029))
has discussed as [the afterlife of slavery]{.underline}. In her
description, she contends that [**Black lives are still grappling with
the lingering arrangements of racism that were cemented by the capture
and conversion of Black people into property**.]{.underline} Duncan
([2017](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029))
echoed a similar sentiment, writing, "[**contemporary forms of racial
oppression and inequality are expressions of allochronic discourses that
inform "ontological Blackness," or the Blackness that whiteness created
as Western civilization began to emerge as a prominent force in the
world**"]{.underline} (p. 67). As such, this long shadow of enslavement
lingers as the grounds of everyday existence for Black lives in the
present. Racialized surveillance The question of existing while Black is
to consider the role of surveillance and its relationship to race.
According to Fiske
([1998](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029)),
["racializing surveillance is where surveillance practices, policies,
and performances concern the production of norms about race and exercise
a power to define what is in or out of place]{.underline}" (p. 81).
Advancing this work, Browne
([2012](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029))
used racializing surveillance to signal moments when various expressions
of surveillance function to reify racialized, discriminatory boundaries.
[**As a technology of social control, racializing surveillance
interprets how processes change dependent on place and time and are,
inextricably, connected to logics of settler colonialism that structure
social relations in ways that center whiteness.** Importantly,
racialized surveillance is interlocking]{.underline} (Collins,
[1990](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029),
[1998](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029))
across gender, class, sexuality, nationality, and other forms of
identity. [From the prison on the sea, **enslavement and plantation
politics introduced racialized surveillance to a western, United States
context.** Accounting practices served as an extension of disciplining
power. Among these recording procedures, **transatlantic slave vessels
listed Black individuals and cargo, while diaries and inventories logged
observations and instructions for governing plantations**.]{.underline}
Documentation, in this way, was a mechanism for what Foucault
([1975](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029))
discussed as disciplinary power because it practiced invisibility while
imposing compulsory visibility on its targets (Foucault,
[1975](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029)).
[Disciplinary power acted as racializing surveillance in that
individuals were at once subject to monitor and simultaneously produced
as racial vis-à-vis enslavable]{.underline} (Browne,
[2012](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029)).
Plantation directives "demonstrate how disciplinary power operated by
way of a set of rules, instructions, routines, inspection, hierarchical
observation, the timetable, and the examination" (Browne,
[2015](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029),
p. 51). [**Made plain in these rules was the notion that surveillance
was an attribute of disciplinary power that could be enacted sovereignly
and at the discretion of those with power**. Therefore, as
McKittrick]{.underline}

[put forth, **the plantation economy evidenced an uneven racial economy
that legislated Black servitude, placeless-ness, and constraint. To
ensure Black subservience, slave patrols were deployed as one method of
racialized surveillance**.]{.underline} Slave patrols as extensions of
racialized surveillance Hadden
([2003](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029))
noted that [policing in the colonial Southern United States, was an
outgrowth of white patrollers and their fascination with what enslaved
Black people were doing. Slave owners, and White Southerners, more
broadly, lived with the fear that enslaved people would rebel, thereby
disrupting the plantation economy]{.underline}. Slave patrols,
engineered, by slave owners and a unified white polity that cut across
class, shared the belief that controlling the movements and behaviors of
enslaved Black people was in the best interest of society. Keying into
their use, slave patrols accomplished several functions: to find,
re-capture, and return runaways; to facilitate organized violence that
would deter rebellions from enslaved Black people; and to ensure
disciplinary oversight over the time, space, and movements of enslaved
Black people (Hadden,
[2003](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029)).
[This informal system of racialized surveillance armed white people and
white institutions with state sanctioned authority to determine who was
in or outside the bounds of appropriate behavior.]{.underline} The
residue of this authority lingers as the assumed social power that White
people wield over and against Black people in formal and informal
learning/meeting spaces.

#### Racial underpinnings of civil society infiltrate educational spaces and judge bias. Educators should orient towards epistemological blackness for accountability in debate.

Black Mobilities in the absence of place: A discussion **[Contemporary
society is laced with the racial underpinnings bound to transatlantic
slavery and colonialism. As such, Black people, and a Black sense of
place are outside of conceptualizations of citizens and
society.]{.underline}** McKittrick
([2011](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029))
suggested that a [Black sense of place can be "understood as the process
of materially and imaginatively situating historical and contemporary
struggles against practices of domination and the difficult
entanglements of racial encounter]{.underline}" (p. 949). Furthermore,
[establishing a sense of place against racialized surveillance evinces
power geometry, which concerns power and its relationship to flows of
movement]{.underline}. Responding to the question, how does racialized
surveillance affect the movements of Black people in public and
educational contexts, the findings show how formal and informal
learning/meeting spaces can mirror history as surveilling, oppressive
agents, that function to control Black people. Further, thinking with
histories of Black men and Black women in the white imaginary created a
nuanced frame for reading Blackness, and more specifically, the function
and disciplining of anti-Blackness in varied social places. Critical
readings of the accounts above demonstrate the ways racialized
surveillance functions to delimit the place and movements of Black
people. Surveillance in the public sphere bleeds into and back through
educational contexts, as Black people become subject to "radical
normalizing projects intent on pathologizing across the dimensions of
race, class, gender, and sexuality. [By normalizing their degradation,
marginalization, and invisibility, it becomes something to which we no
longer pay attention"]{.underline} (Cohen,
[2010](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029),
p. 128). **[These two scenes denote a curriculum about who is valued,
outlining the parameters for citizenship in the afterlife of slavery.
Again, in the afterlife of slavery, Black people are marked as socially
dead, inhabiting a nonhuman, nonentity status, placing visible and
invisible limitations on their mobility]{.underline}**. Thus, "W[hat if
some subjects never achieve, in the eyes of others, the status of the
'living\']{.underline}? What if these subjects merely haunt the
periphery of the encountering person\'s vision, remaining, like the past
and the ancestors who inhabit it" (Holland,
[2000](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029),
p. 15)? The scenes above present several instances where Nelson,
Robinson, and Siyonbola grappled with this question, and, in doing so,
reckoned with the pervasiveness of racialized surveillance and the
compounding histories of anti-Blackness logged against them. In
particular, Nelson, Robinson, and Siyonbola enacted three maneuvers to
negotiate racialized surveillance: they assert their right to presence,
they document the incidents, and they survive the moment. Negotiating
racialized surveillance For Nelson and Robinson, whereas [anti-Blackness
assumes that Black people should comport to postures of acquiescence, or
do what they are told, they claim their right to presence. Evidence of
this assertion can be seen in their rebuttal to arresting officers about
why they were being told to leave]{.underline}. Asserting presence in
this incident seems to be driven by what Nelson and Robinson know about
informal learning/meeting spaces, and, too, the discretionary basis by
which policies were being administered. Of note, [their assertion,
rooted in the explanation that they were at the location for a business
meeting confronts histories of racialized surveillance, **like slave
patrolling, that questioned Black gatherings as dangerous and
unproductive.** Furthermore, Nelson and Robinson's challenge to the
surveilling order by claiming their right to presence openly critiqued
the power structure and called into question the uneven distribution of
policies.]{.underline} Relatedly, although Nelson and Robinson were not
explicitly engaged in documenting the incident, their assertions invited
those in the vicinity into the conversation as witnesses. Here, one can
see how [decisions to openly question racialized surveillance can lead
to a communal reckoning, where others might take up the responsibility
of advocacy]{.underline}. That said, confrontations with anti-Blackness
can be fatal, so, the importance of surviving the moment cannot be
overstated. One example of survival practice can be heard from Robinson;
when asked about the situation, he later noted that he was "thinking
about \[his\] family...\[his\] community." **[His expression
reintroduced a familiar tension for Black people under the watchful gaze
of whiteness that required one to think about resistance as tied to
survival. Robinson conceded to a history that knows there have been
instances that Black men encounter police and do not make it home to see
their families. Nelson and Robinson were modeling a capacity for Black
folks to maneuver through society in a manner that kept them legible in
the face of premature death]{.underline}**. The decisions they made to
quiet their expression should not, then, read as acts of surrender or
acceptance of guilt, but an expression of agentic memory. Relatedly, in
a maneuver that flips the tools of power being used against her,
Siyonbola has the presence of mind to record the incident. **[This
practice follows a long history of Black people who have used the
written and oral tradition to hold purveyors of anti-Black violence
accountable for their actions. Providing a live account of anti-Black
violence, while wholly imperfect, is one form of accountability and a
method to convey the racialized realities of Black people beyond the
occurrence.]{.underline}** Siyonbola, too, openly troubled the
discursive practices that attempt to frame her as a/the problem. In the
second video, one of the officers says to Siyonbola that everything will
be okay and that she is not in trouble. Siyonbola, sharply replied to
his comment, stating, "I know it\'s going to be okay; I know I am not in
trouble, my ancestors built this institution" (Siyonbola,
[2018b](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029),
00:11:54). [This expression of refusal invoked what hooks
([1992](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029))
described as an oppositional gaze, produced by the racialized
surveillance that sought to legislate Black feeling, being, knowing, and
mobilities. In choosing to look, which in this instance is to challenge
perceived behavioral expectations (hooks,
[1992](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029)),
the decision declared: "Not only will I stare. I want my look to change
reality]{.underline}" (hooks,
[1992](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029),
p. 58). Siyonbola\'s position is both grounded in history and charting a
new curriculum for present and future students who will inhabit the
institution. Educator's relationship to racialized surveillance
**[Educators working with Black people, inside and outside of
educational contexts, should consider how structural elements may
facilitate racialized surveillance. Among these elements, educators
should take stock of sanctions or policies and regulations that punish
disobedience and reward that which is considered good behavior.
Sanctions can push students into adjudication processes by upholding
narrow cultural standards. Additionally, sanctions may function as rules
of social control in order to monitor the actions of those
unacculturated, exposing students who are not fluent in the cultural
dynamics of a place.]{.underline}** A second structural element that
educators ought to be mindful of is sentiment, or expressed feelings
between people or groups that communicates superiority (e.g., those
enslaved are to express victimization; enslavers express paternalism).
In these instances, Black students, purposefully or inadvertently, may
be made to feel powerless or that someone has clear power over them. A
third structural element should examine norms within educational
contexts. [Different from sanctions and sentiment, the construction of
norms sets the tone for how students are supposed to show up in a place,
revealed in instances of institutional rhetoric, departmental practices,
and classroom governance. For example, what are the rules that govern
exchange in a classroom setting.]{.underline} Following Baszile
([2015](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00131946.2022.2051029)),
Enlightenment rationality calls for the dispassionate and objective
pursuit of truth, which too often stymies possibilities for Black
student's embodied knowing and being.

### Failed states -- Howell & Richter-Montpetit 19

#### Failed state discourse is colonial and racist\-\--turns case 

**Howell and Richter-Montpetit 19** Alison Howell, Rutgers University --
Newark AND Melanie Richter-Montpetit, University of Sussex "Is
Securitization Theory Racist? Civilizationism, Methodological Whiteness
and Antiblack thought in the Copenhagen School" Journal: Security
Dialogue

[Classic ST is civilizationist in that it believes that there are more
or less]{.underline} politically and morally [developed civilizations,
yet the problem runs even deeper]{.underline} than this. Worse,
[it]{.underline} also [avers that 'underdeveloped' civilizations
**represent a threat**]{.underline} to supposedly more advanced ones.
[This becomes]{.underline} especially [clear when examining ST's ideas
about '**state failure'**]{.underline}. ST claims that [in 'developed'
states]{.underline} (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998, 28) [a civilized
political sphere generally fends off securitization]{.underline}, except
when "securitization is unavoidable, as when states are faced with an
implacable or barbarian aggressor" (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998,
29). [By contrast, in 'failed' or 'weak' states securitization runs
amok]{.underline}: "In well-developed states, armed forces and
intelligence services are carefully separated from normal political
life, and their use is subject to elaborate procedures of authorization.
Where such separation is not in place, as in many weak states... much of
normal politics is pushed into the security realm" (Buzan, Wæver, and de
Wilde 1998, 28). [This]{.underline} excessive securitization, in turn,
[leads to primal]{.underline} (**[or 'Hobbesian']{.underline}** or
'Kaplanesque') **[anarchy]{.underline}** wherein the state "fails to
take root or spirals into disintegration. [This situation can lead
to]{.underline} prolonged periods of primal [anarchy, as]{.underline} is
currently the case [in **Afghanistan** and]{.underline} various parts of
**[Africa]{.underline}**, in which the state is only a shadow and
reality is one of rival warlords and gangs" (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde
1998, 50, emphasis added; for analysis of the colonial preoccupation
with Afghan \'tribes\' see Manchanda 2018). [Discourses of state failure
are "irredeemably rooted in an **imperial** and **racialized
imagination**]{.underline}" (Gruffydd Jones 2014, 65; see also Grovogui
2001; Wai 2012a; Wai 2012b; Shilliam 2013). While they may avoid overt
reference to race, [they operate within a lineage of **racial
discourse** which emerged to justify **colonialism**, and **continuing
trusteeship**. This racial hierarchy is fully represented in ST's list
of weak and **failing states**]{.underline}: Nigeria under Abacha,
Sudan, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Liberia, and "various parts of Africa",
the USSR under Stalin, Bosnia, Colombia, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and so
on (cf. Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998, 28, 50, 69, 146). [This is a
racial discourse: 'primal anarchy' is primarily located in '**brown'**
('Afghanistan') and '**black'** ('parts of Africa')
**regions**]{.underline}. That Copenhagen School theorists sometimes
seem to be aware of how this division falls does not lead them to
question it. On the contrary, they warn against Western-centrism, but
only in order to emphasize that it is in the West that 'normal'
civilized politics exists: "if domestic and international were fixed,
there would be a risk of generating a cozy Western view of politics:
Domestic politics is normal and without security, whereas the extreme is
relegated to the international space. In other parts of the world,
domestic is not cozy" (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998, 47, note 7). For
ST, primal anarchy exists, not only in the international realm, but also
in non-Western 'other parts of the world', where a failure of normal
politics leads to "'tribalist' forms of association" (Buzan, Wæver, and
de Wilde 1998, 69). In doing so, [ST refuses to seriously consider the
role of **modern colonialism** and ongoing **imperial warfare** in
'**failed states'**. Such consideration might reveal the significance of
**colonial extraction of resources and labor**, **colonial policies of
divide and rule**, **colonial imposition of state borders**, and
**military and covert intervention** by Western powers, such as the US
state's **arming and training of Mujahedeen**]{.underline} forces in
Afghanistan in the 1980s. Instead, ST frames 'failed states' as evidence
of a primal state of nature. [The idea that there has been (White)
civilizational progress away from (racialized) primal anarchy is
**omnipresent**]{.underline} in ST. [Civilizationism is
**not**]{.underline} just **[a]{.underline}** collateral, [**detachable,
part** of ST's imaginary]{.underline}, or a sadly unattended-to
implication of its Kaplanesque view of anarchy or its Arendtian model of
politics. [ST's vision of the world relies on a supposedly fundamental
opposition between politicization and securitization]{.underline}.
Ungrounded in the racist and civilizationist narrative that 'normal
politics' emerged from 'primal anarchy', this opposition would look as
arbitrary as it in fact is.

The Hudson Valley of New York state is a region with a tradition of
landscape valorization and conservation that figures prominently in the
history of U.S. environmentalism. For a generation, land conservation
organizations have reacted to a trend of farm closures by purchasing
agricultural land. They justify this expansion of their prior commitment
to preserving only "wild" landscapes through allusions to regional
agricultural heritage. In this paper, I consider what is carried forth
into the present through the pastoral landscape and efforts to preserve
it. [Since the dawn of the colonial period]{.underline} in the Hudson
Valley, [agriculture]{.underline}, especially animal agriculture, [has
constituted a powerful landscape-making assemblage]{.underline}, one
both [deeply dependent on racial slavery and]{.underline} uniquely
implicated in (never-complete) attempts at [Native
displacement]{.underline}. [Importing European farm animals and
their]{.underline} associate [organisms recomposed the region
ecologically, enabling the proliferation of colonial
settlement]{.underline}. Then as now, [the remaking of the
land]{.underline} is itself [a site of politics and a means of realizing
possible futures]{.underline}. Drawing from long-term ethnographic
research, I describe how the affective experience imparted to some
by [the pastoral scene affirms a sense of place]{.underline} and
belonging [that obscures the indelible impressions of racial slavery and
ongoing settler colonialism]{.underline}, [legitimating segregation and
the centrality of Whiteness in this celebrated landscape]{.underline}.
Long-running, generative violence flows through everyday practices and
affects, delivering the present despite blending into the seemingly
ahistorical scenery. Addressing the persistence of settler colonialism,
antiblackness, and White supremacy requires attention to a wider range
of political scenes and actors than are often considered in studies of
these formations. This paper begins and ends with reflections on a
fraught attempt to conduct ethnographic research with [captive
chickens]{.underline}, paradoxically called Freedom Rangers, [who lived
on small-scale]{.underline}, organic animal farms in the Hudson Valley.
Species difference and [the violence of confinement]{.underline} led me
to question the promise of interlocution and instead [attend more
expansively to the conditions of possibility of our
undeniable]{.underline} if unsought [relation]{.underline}. I began with
a basic question: why were the chickens here? Although my farmer
interlocutors leased land from regional land conservation nonprofits,
there was no obvious ecological rationale. Indeed, although the
nonprofits generally prided themselves on operating in accordance with
scientifically informed best practices, [reports were]{.underline} all
the time [raising concerns about the]{.underline} [role of agricultural
expansion in exacerbating global biodiversity crises.]{.underline} There
was no reason to think the situation was any different locally. Among
other impacts, [the native plant communities found in open
areas]{.underline} in this part of the world [cannot endure
regular grazing and are rapidly replaced by European pasture plants once
farm animals are introduced]{.underline}. Nor was the reason for the
chickens primarily economic. While the farmers were capable and
extremely dedicated, they had other career paths available to them that
would have been more lucrative and less exhausting. This recognition led
me to ask what else the chickens yielded beyond a relatively small
amount of meat and a modest profit. Local residents and tourists'
repeated descriptions of the sense of affective rightness they
experienced at the sight of pastures like these led me to Virginia
DeJohn Anderson's (2004) insistence that animal agriculture in early
colonial North America as never merely a matter of subsistence alone but
rather a practice understood to exemplify Christian civilization.
Pursuing this insight through regional historical accounts, I engage
Ashley Carse's (2014) proposal of landscapes as infrastructure in which
materiality and more-than-human relations are reworked toward specific
economic and political ends. Such endeavors, I argue, have an essential
affective component. [In the Hudson Valley, the achievement of this
agrarian landscape]{.underline} infrastructure [has moved some
people literally]{.underline}, as [through Native displacement and Black
banishment]{.underline}, and others figuratively, such as through the
visceral pleasure of beholding the consecrated scene. Through a
discussion of how contemporary invocations of the cute and humane in
relation to small-scale animal agriculture stabilize White
self-understanding and perceptions of the past, I return to the
prospects for my would-be more-than-human ethnography with the chickens.
Here I suggest that the freight of history both limits the capacity for
such research while also obligating specific forms of accountability.
This research comprises a portion of my broader dissertation project
which altogether addresses long-term processes of Hudson Valley
landscape generation through their entwinement with settler colonialism,
racial slavery, and its aftermath. Beyond agriculture, I also studied
alongside regional anti-invasive species practitioners as they contended
with the accumulated fallout of centuries of species introductions
motivated by colonial goals of biological improvement and replacement.
Here too, particular practices of comprehending the past bore directly
on the pursuit of present-day landscape ambitions. Through this paper
and the larger project, I engage scholarship from feminist science
studies, Black studies, and Native studies in an attempt to stage a
conversation about multidimensional legacies of violence, the figure of
the human, and the power of its constitutive exclusions. [Approaching
the materiality of the landscape as a crucial site of politics and U.S.
racial formations enables new insights on the extent to which White
supremacy and settler colonialism bear on]{.underline}, for instance,
the urgencies of species loss and habitat degradation. Finally,
following the notable writing of Juno Parreñas (2018) and others, I was
motivated to foreground the stakes of ethnographies of captive nonhumans
given that, in the United States today, roughly as many birds live in
conditions of confinement as do
not.[\[1\]](https://laptrinhx.com/news/link/?l=https%3A%2F%2Faesengagement.wordpress.com%2F2021%2F02%2F09%2Ffreedom-rangers-and-landscapes-that-move-people%2F%23_ftn1) Through
pursuing a multiscalar approach, I try to mediate what sometimes seems
like a tension between multispecies studies that either focus on the
lived experience of small groups of nonhumans and those that address
whole species or populations through a more sweeping historical
register.

Moreover, [agricultural technologies were oriented toward replacing
Black workers]{.underline}, particularly [as growing
organization]{.underline} and mobility [led to rising wages and began to
threaten the power and profits of the plantation bloc]{.underline}
(Woodruff 1994). This process drew on [herbicides and
defoliants]{.underline}, which [were]{.underline}, alongside mechanical
cotton harvesters, explicitly intended as a means of replacing (and
displacing) workers (Williams and Williams 2021). These chemicals,
[deployed in service of protecting the profitability and monocultural
dominance of an inedible fiber, also killed vegetables and garden
plots]{.underline}. Southern plantation and [agro-industrial interests
depicted]{.underline} agricultural [chemicals in ways that reveal
a]{.underline} deep symbolic [traffic between systems for the
incarceration of people and technologies for the destruction of insect
and plant life.]{.underline} In pesticide advertisements and extension
documents, [weeds and insects were frequently depicted as criminals,
deserving of capital punishment through chemicals.]{.underline} A 1960s
Mississippi Cooperative Extension Service publication, for example,
featured an anthropomorphized cotton boll punching a masked and armed
bandit, and urged farmers to "Kill Those Cotton Robbing Weeds" using
herbicides.7 [During this period of growing resistance to plantation
white supremacy, pests were also represented as racialized insurgents,
such as a cartoon of a boll weevil holding a placard that declared
"Insects si, planters no!",]{.underline} or an insecticide advertisement
featuring group of boll weevils mobilizing to fight for "Weevil Power".8
Perhaps most tellingly, calcium cyanamide powder, [the first
commercially-available cotton defoliant, was nicknamed "Black
Annie]{.underline}", presumably after the infamous whip used against
people imprisoned at Parchman, [an emblem of racial cruelty and
coercion]{.underline} (Crawford, et  al. 2000, Oshinsky 1996).9 I[n both
their representation and their effects, chemicals were part of a
continuum with the carceral dynamics of southern plantation prisons, and
the willful production of hunger as a tool of attempted racial
control.]{.underline} As Clyde Woods (1998) has emphasized, [the Green
Revolution]{.underline} in the plantation regions of the US South [was
not oriented toward self-sufficiency, food production, or even
productivity for its own sake]{.underline}. The use of chemicals and
mechanization were intended to quell dissent through the dispossession
of Black southerners, putatively guided by agricultural productivity
concerns. The role of chemicals as productivity-boosting technologies
was oriented just as much toward the continued monopolization of land
and resources as it was toward the production of an inedible commodity.
We are suggesting that [the monocultural dynamics of plantations
were]{.underline} never exclusively or primarily about productivity per
se, but [about conjoined ecological and social control]{.underline}.
Plantations have been fundamentally dependent on the lives, work and
knowledge of enslaved or otherwise unfree workers (Carney 2001, Davis
et  al. 2019). But [the orientation toward political-ecological control
instills a contradictory drive to deskill, to standardize]{.underline},
to regiment, [and]{.underline} most crucially to [constrain Black living
and curtail Black agency.]{.underline}

Source: (Zimmer, 2018) Cartoonist: Andrzej Krauze 8 the contingencies of
converging milieusis also posed as a shift away from the days of science
vested in upholding racial hierarchies. More than merely providing an
alternative understanding of the body than the one cherished by racial
scientists, the promise of post-racial science is to actually dismantle
and redress racism by disproving race. The way the science of race today
promises to undo racial science of yesteryear was embedded into pedagogy
by the time I entered college in 2008. Entering college as a biology
major on a pre-med track, I distinctly remember introductory courses
presenting three sets of scientific claims that teachers used to
destabilize racism by destabilizing race and the body. The first set of
claims concern pigmentation as an adaptive variation. [According to the
post-racial dogma, blackness as skin color is the long evolutionary
product of the level of sun in the environment]{.underline}, whereby too
much sun, like in environments close to the equator, can destroy folic
acid which is necessary for fetal cranial development. In turn,
increased melanin production protects from UV rays. At the same time,
too little sun in higher latitudes can lead to Vitamin D deficiency,
which can cause rickets, so less melanin protection enables maximum
absorption of UV rays under conditions of minimal sun. [Therefore,
whiteness as skin color is also considered the product of the plasticity
of body-environment relations. Pigmentation here is not just about
bodies' openness to the environment but also skin color is an adaptive
response, and improvement in fitness, in accordance to variegated
environmental contexts.]{.underline} Microbial science extends these
ideas by explaining how the metabolic reactions that produce melanin, a
derivative of the Greek word "melonas" for black, in both mammals and
the rest of the animal and plant kingdom, reflect the capacities of
microorganisms to synthesize the diversity of melanin molecules (Tran-Ly
et al., 2020). In other words, in this view microbes provide the
mechanisms to explain how the body, far from fixed, is a palimpsest of
environmental adaptations. The nature 9 of human difference is the
environmentally contingent yet durable nature of microbial difference, a
source of variation that is given a 3-billion-year history in the deep
evolutionary time of life on earth.

#### Biotechnology is rooted in a homeostatic blackness that disavows that body through constant pathology and information.

In her work on the technical genealogies of cybernetics and
posthumanism, Hayles locates the emergence of a technologically derived
episteme associated with the information theory of Claude Shannon and
the cybernetics of Norbert Wiener. In The Mathematical Theory of
Communication (first published in 1949), Shannon and Warren Weaver
provide the [technical foundations for modern communications
technologies by conceiving of a unilinear transmission line]{.underline}
(a message transmitted from A to B). Likewise, in his equally technical
treatise Cybernetics (first published in 1948), Norbert Wiener
established [a mode of thinking of machines or organisms as relay
systems that incorporate feedback, input, output, and noise]{.underline}
(Shannon and Weaver 1965; Wiener 1996). It is in this tradition that
Hayles proposes a shift from more traditional, modern notions of
subjectivity, based on presence and absence (we are reminded here of
Descartes\'s criteria of a mind present to itself), [to an episteme
based on a related dichotomy between \"pattern\" and
\"randomness\"]{.underline} (1999, 39-40). At issue in each dyad
(presence-absence, pattern-randomness) is a hierarchical valuation, but
**[central to the shift itself is an increasing]{.underline}** 82 \|
EUGENE THACKER **[acceptance of a worldview based on an essentializing
of information as the source of an object]{.underline}**. For Hayles,
the danger with the shift to pattern and randomness is that it contains
the potential to simply replay the ideologies and anxieties of the
presence/absence dyad, resulting in [**a devaluation of the body and
materiality and a valuation of the manipulability, replicability, and
disembodiedness of information.** In looking at the genealogy of
information theory and cybernetics, we see a network of impelling
factors that collectively and situationally contribute to the kinds of
questions asked by researchers.]{.underline} Military research, general
telecommunications research, cryptography, developments in mainframe
computers in military and business applications, all play a significant
role in the formation of the technical concept of information. Though
Wiener (often referred to as the father of cybernetics) and Shannon
(often credited with the development of information theory) worked
separately on the problems of informational communication, both
contributed to a solidification of information as a concept within
engineering, communications, computer science, and a range of other
fields. First, we might take Shannon\'s model for communication to
distinguish several elements involved in the processing of information.
Shannon depicts information not as an object but as a resultant
measurement from processes, and each of these processes is a
differential between some two values. Information thus passes through a
sender, is encoded into a particular technological format appropriate
for communication (e.g., telephone, telegraph, the Internet), is
transmitted via a given technological medium (electrical wire, fiber
optic cable), is decoded as it arrives at its destination, and then goes
to the receiver (Shannon and Weaver 1965, 31-35). Using this model, we
can distinguish three elements at work: a \"message\" or content,
information, and the medium. This distinction is important to note
because Shannon\'s model shows us that we are not simply dealing with a
form/ content dichotomy. [The quantity \"information\" is situated
between the meaning or content it codes for and the medium that supports
it.]{.underline} The distinction is also important because neither
Shannon nor Wiener make much mention of the medium or the hardware
involved in the information transmission process. Just as the quantity
\"information\" is assumed to unproblematically signify the message, so
is the medium assumed to unproblematically mediate information. As will
be DATA MADE FLESH \| 83 suggested later, this downplaying of the
medium, and this assumption of information technology as transparent,
will significantly affect the ways in which subjects and bodies are or
are not mediated through newer fields such as biotechnology. [Second,
this emphasis on information as a quantitative unit does not mean that
there is an object called \"information\" that is qualitatively
different from the message.]{.underline} Ironically, the rhetorical
emphasis of Shannon and Weaver on information as a value irrespective of
the content or meaning implies that information is indissociable from
content/meaning. Although Shannon and Weaver explicitly state that
information is not the content or meaning, they do not say that
information can be separated from content/meaning (Shannon and Weaver
1965, 8-95). This is an important distinction because it suggests that
what is of primary concern in information theory and cybernetics is to
develop a means by which a \"message\" (Wiener\'s preferred term) or
\"content\" (the term Weaver, Shannon\'s collaborator, uses) may be
quantified so that it may be transmitted through a feedback system (in
cybernetics) or along a transmission line (in telecommunications). Thus,
it is not exactly accurate to state that Wiener and Shannon want to
simply encode meaning, if by this we mean that they want to take meaning
as a completely separate unit, which is then translated from a language
of quality into a language of quantity (in short, into a language of
mathematics). Wiener and Shannon do, however, separately attempt to
conceive of a kind of quantifiable signifying system whereby the message
or content is always already accounted for by its status as information.
In other words, information, while not an object or a thing, is
nevertheless the constantly varying, quantitative value of a message or
content at a given point within either the cybernetic system or the line
of communication. Information, then, as a quantifiable value, must
always account for the message or content, even if the message is
incomplete, scrambled, or distorted (noise). Finally, [there is a
working assumption in cybernetics and information theory that **the
informational system\'s goal is always a state of stability and order,
and, to borrow a term that is used both in cybernetics and biology,
directed toward a state of homeostasis**]{.underline} (Hayles 1999, 7-8;
Wiener 1996, 8-16). [What distinguishes information from noise is the
stability and internal order of information as it]{.underline} 84 \|
EUGENE THACKER [travels across informational channels]{.underline}.
Although this foundational assumption of the homeostatic system was
modified by later developments in cybernetic theory, it still provides a
technical basis for the ways in which information is distributed to this
day, and it is here that the links with modern biology make themselves
evident. A **[homeostatic system, be it biological or informatic,
continues to maintain its operational mode with a minimum of deviation
from that mode-be it a pathology or static, disease or
error]{.underline}**. What both Wiener and Shannon establish for later
conceptualizations of information is an identity between information and
stasis, such that the primary effects of information on a system
reinforce that system\'s stable congruity through time. In the systems
mapped out by Wiener and Shannon, [information does not so much alter
the system\'s mode of operation as it primarily serves as a regulatory
process that triggers the maintenance of a normative mode of operativity
of a system]{.underline}. The assumption that Shannon and Wiener work
from is that meaning is and should be stable with regard to information.
However, [**in order to secure such stability, the transmission of
meaning must also be stable: the carriers of information, the
transmission of information, must also be stable, constant, and thus
transparent**.]{.underline} This is not a theoretical question, but a
technical question, a question of operationality and systematicity.
Ironically then, in order to secure the stability of information as
meaning, researchers in computer science, information theory, and
cybernetics must also focus on the transmission, carriers, and the
encoding/decoding processes of information. The question for Shannon and
Wiener is \"how can we keep such and such a medium from affecting the
meaning of the information signal?\" and not \"how will such and such a
medium affect the meaning of the information signal?\" The very language
of computer science contains within it this assumption; signals may be
encoded, transmitted, and decoded across a range of media, as long as
the media are technically able to facilitate the transmission of
information that is self-identical. Thus the questions that Shannon and
Wiener separately ask result in their theoretical formulations: for
Shannon and Weaver working on telecommunications problems at Bell Labs,
information is a quantitative measure of the accuracy of the
reproduction of a signal from point A to point B (Shannon and Weaver
1965, 8-16). For Norbert DATA MADE FLESH \| 85 Wiener, working at MIT
and for the military, information is the range of choices available at a
particular instant, within a cybernetic system composed of
inputs/sensors, outputs/effectors, and a central mechanism of feedback
(Wiener 1996, 6-9). Both researchers grounded their research in a notion
of information as (1) concurrent with meaning but stabilized through a
medium, (2) a quantitative value independent of qualitative changes or
changes in meaning, and (3) a value thus stable across media and
independent of media. **[These characteristics, which form what we might
call a \"classical theory of information,\" are directly related to the
ways in which the posthuman has traditionally equated information with
disembodiedness]{.underline}** (Hayles 1999, 4-5, 47-48). [The medium of
information (to be distinguished from the message and from information)
**is transparent with respect to information, so that information is
taken to be abstracted and self-identical across different media, or
across different technological platforms.** As the central unit
operating within systems that work toward a homeostatic state,
**information is seen to play a central role in maintaining, restoring,
or producing a normative, regulatory operational state for the system, a
system that constantly works toward a state of stasis and
self-identity.**]{.underline} While these are not problematic
implications in themselves, when taken within the larger context of the
relationship between information technologies and technoscience, they
replay the association between disembodiedness and information
characterized by Hayles. The reason information can be a self-identical
value, across media, across signifying processes, and across systemic
contexts, is precisely because it is conceived, from the beginning, as a
value independent of material instantiation. When information is
regarded as information, no matter what medium \"carries\" it, it then
becomes a universal, disconnected from the material-technical
necessities of the medium, the processes, and the context. It is this
universalizing and decontextualizing of information that enables Wiener
to conceive of machines and organisms as the same, from the perspective
of cybernetic systems operating through feedback loops. I do not want to
imply here a critique of Wiener\'s overall suggestions regarding
cybernetic systems; it is the particular way in which information-the
central unit of Wiener\'s and Shannon\'s theories-is or is not
intimately constrained by the contingencies of embodiedness that
provides 86 \| EUGENE THACKER the point of problematization: the theory
of information that these foundational texts present to us is one in
which information is universalized, decontextualized, and disconnected
from the necessities of technological contingency. We might refer to
this process of making a certain definition of \"information\"
foundational to considerations of the body-which I am locating in the
work of Wiener and Shannon-as \"informatic essentialism.\" Informatic
essentialism is not a repression, denial, or effacement of the body; it
proposes that the relationships between the biological body and
information technology is such that the body may be approached through
the lens of information. In other words, by making informatics a
foundational worldview, the body can be considered as \"essentially\"
information. This position-which can be ascribed to the extropian branch
of posthumanism with which we began-is not, of course, exclusive to
concerns over the bodytechnology relationship; however, it is in this
relationship that the tensions inherent in informatic essentialism
become clearer. Informatic essentialism makes the primary move of
suggesting that the body-as a material substrate more often than not
defined by the biological sciences-can be successfully interpreted and
thus reconfigured through an informatic worldview. This also implies
that, as information, this body-the body regarded through the lens of
informatics-is therefore subject to the same set of technical actions
and regulations as is all information. In short, when the body is
considered as essentially information, this opens onto the possibility
that the body may also be programmed and reprogrammed (and whose
predecessor is genetic engineering). Understood as essentially
information, and as (re)programmable, the body in informatic
essentialism increasingly becomes valued less according to any notion of
materiality or substance (as we still see in modern biology) and more
according to the value of information itself as the index to all
material instantiation-a kind of source code for matter. The complexity
in the posthuman position outlined here is that, on the one hand, it
does not necessarily deny materiality or the body, but on the other
hand, in equating information with the body it interprets materiality
and body in terms of an informational pattern-an asymmetrical, strategic
move. With a view of materiality as DATA MADE FLESH \| 87 information,
materiality is, again, not denied by the posthumanist position;
materiality is now a programmable informational pattern with real
effects in a variety of social, political, and scientific contexts. The
key to informatic essentialist thinking is not disembodiment, but
something more along the lines of file conversions and data translation.
To condense our analysis thus far, we might suggest that the logic of
informatic essentialism is as follows: information equals the body,
which by extension implies that information equals biology and/or
materiality, which leads from the contingency of the biological body to
the emancipation of the biological body through the technical potential
of informatics. Change the code, and you change the body. FROM
POSTHUMANISM TO BIOTECH What the extropian branches of the posthuman, as
well as the critiques of the posthuman, divert their attention from are
the ways in which an informatic essentialism is not something exclusive
to the fields of computer-based, cybernetic, and information technology
research. Especially when considering notions of the body, informatic
essentialism becomes a powerful source of speculation, having as much to
do with embodiment as with disembodiment. The model of the posthuman
outlined thus far, focusing on the body-technology relationship, has
been asymmetrical. It has provided a more or less linear narrative,
whereby certain prevalent new research fields (computer science,
cybernetics, and information technologies), through a logic of
informatic essentialism, reinterpret the natural, biological body as
information and then move on to incorporate all notions of materiality
and body into an abstract, disembodied level of operativity based on
some notion of consciousness or intelligence. What we have not accounted
for are the ways in which current developments in the life sciences are
equally active in the material transformations of notions of the body
and life itself. [This inquiry, **this investigation into the informatic
qualities of the biological body, is already taking place in
contemporary molecular biotechnology through the immanently practical
means of research, clinical trials, product pipelines, and medical
applications**.]{.underline} In press releases from 88 1 EUGENE THACKER
[biotech corporations, in articles in science publications, in
interviews with researchers, one increasingly hears a refrain: as Nobel
laureate and genomics pioneer Leroy Hood puts it, \"**biology is
information.\"1 Emerging fields, from proteomics to regenerative
medicine, are employing computer technology and computer science
research into the \"wet lab.\"2 Such practical transformations assumedly
bolster the biotech industry by making genome mapping, gene targeting,
and product development more efficient**.]{.underline} But on the
research side, such intersections between bioscience and computer
science may also significantly transform some of the foundational
concepts in molecular genetics. For instance, the initial report of the
human genome map revealed, among other things, that the number of human
genes was far less than researchers had expected, thus prompting many
within the research community to call for more complex approaches to
studying gene expression, biopathways, and biological systems.
Similarly, the controversies over a number of population-genome projects
(most notably in Iceland) have raised issues over how ethnicity and race
are assumed to smoothly overlap with culture-all of which is being
interpreted through genetic data. Without a consideration of the ways in
which the current life sciences are reinterpreting the organism, the
body, and life, we risk assuming that, in the epistemological changes
brought about by the posthumanist position, the only danger is that of
disembodiment. [**Biotechnology research presents us with a turbulent
zone in which the questions that concern posthumanist thinking are
brought to a tensioned pitch, in which research seems more science
fictional than science fiction itself** (\"neo-organs\" grown on
demand), and in which a range of issues have attracted public
controversy (governmental regulations over human cloning). **Biotech**
research **is unique in that**, on the one hand, **it employs
technologies common to other posthuman fields** (principally,
computer/information technologies), but on the other hand, **its
constant \"object\" of study is the domain of the biological** (a domain
traditionally set apart from the technological). Instead of being
focused on disembodiment and virtuality, **biotech research\'s approach
to informatics is toward the capacities of information to materialize
bodies** (bodies amenable to current paradigms of medicine and health
care).]{.underline}

[The second central dogma of post-racial science]{.underline} I remember
learning in biology [class is that genetic diversity and hybridity is
linked to increased capacity to adapt and increased fitness, whereas
purity or homogeneity is linked to disease.]{.underline} Marshalling
frequently cited molecular studies of Tay-sachs disease and sickle cell
disease, my teachers explained how the inheritance of one 'abnormal'
gene and one 'normal' gene actually increases protection against TB and
malaria respectively. It is only if the child inherits the 'abnormal'
gene from both parents that such abnormality expresses itself as
disease. In other words[, homogeneity equals disease risk, heterogeneity
equals adaptive potential or resiliency. In so doing, the association
between racial categories and pathology]{.underline} (e.g., sickle cell
as a Black disease and Tay-sachs as a Jewish disease[) is seemingly
loosened as both difference and disease risk are figured as expressions
of different environmental conditions.]{.underline} Again, microbiome
science extends these ideas by linking microbial diversity, abundance,
and heterogeneity to increased resilience, adaptability and thus
fitness. Conversely, decreased microbial diversity is an expression of
homogenization and purity---and is linked to vulnerability, disease, and
even collapse. In other words, through nature's value of hybridity over
purity, microbiome science exemplifies how post-genomics promises to
unhinge 'race' from pathology. Extending the significance of this claim
about the positive correlation (or even causation) between genetic
diversity and fitness as environmental adaptability, the third
post-racial claim I learned in science class is that there is more
genetic diversity within Africans than between Africans and other
"populations." In other words, ideas about genetic variation renders the
10 distinction between populations moot, genetic variation is considered
to be greater endemically than in-between or across groups. 4 Moreover,
["Africa" is considered the "population" with the greatest internal
genetic diversity precisely because it is considered the birthplace of
the human species.]{.underline} African genetic diversity is in turn
posed as the common heritage for all of humanity (Reardon and TallBear,
2012). Microbiome science extends this link between Africa and the
shared evolutionary origins of the human by linking the ancestral human
microbiome to the microbial diversity found in contemporary indigenous
communities predominantly in Africa. [This provides lifestyle-driven,
environmental explanations for the speciation or divergence of the human
species from primate relatives,]{.underline} following the out-of-Africa
origin story of the human (Gomez et al., 2016; Schnorr et al., 2014).
Indeed, in the context of illustrating the potential for
cross-disciplinary collaborations to disrupt essentializing notions of
race, Benezra provides the example of a new project called "Afrobiota"
(2020). Started in 2019 by a group of microbial ecologists, biological
anthropologists, and historians, the project links studying "Africa" to
the production of microbiome knowledge at "multiple scales, levels of
variability" as well as crossdisciplinary approaches that can "tackle
questions spanning conditions from the laboratory to the field" (2020:
16, quoting Amato et al. 2019).

#### The theorization of black fungibility must be given epistemological priority in questions of biotechnology. Ontology is the only explanation for the manipulation of black flesh under the rubrics of biological experimentation.

[To take up the microbiomization of life from a geographical
perspective,]{.underline} or in other words, through the epistemologies
and analytical toolbox of space, scale, and place, which themselves
constitute ontological claims about human-nature relations, [without
addressing black fungibility can only reproduce epistemological
practices and ontological stakes of anti-blackness.]{.underline} In
other words, [to take up space, scale, and place, through the universal
categories of the human and nature misses how both human and nature only
emerge as subject-objects]{.underline} or bodies in the 19th century
[under the weight of]{.underline} 400 years of [generating value through
experimentation with the equivalencies between blackness and the captive
body]{.underline}. This miss is not innocent but [implicated in the
historical erasure of these experimental equivalencies and thus
perpetuates the relation between the universal (a-historical and
a-geographical) and righteousness of whiteness]{.underline}. I argue
[black fungibility is an analytic that reckons with the relationship
between antiblackness and microbial ontologies of life by denaturalizing
antiblackness as an ontology.]{.underline} To do so, I first draw on
scholarship that conceptualizes antiblackness as an ontology. By
ontology I mean [both the experience of being]{.underline} (existence as
experience, subjective dimensions) [and claims about the nature of
existence]{.underline} (which have been [institutionalized through the
disciplines of biology]{.underline} and the rest of the fields in the
natural sciences, or objective dimensions). This is not to affirm the
natural sciences claims of objectivity (as in fact-based, value
neutrality) but rather to highlight the relational authority of naming
ontological objects, that [is, the process of
objectification]{.underline}. Secondly, I draw on scholarship that
conceptualizes black fungibility in terms of the birth of human
commodities. [The commodification of the human articulates a relation
between property and desire that links the biological human to the
political human through the]{.underline} 28 [market]{.underline} (or
liberal humanism, where the self-mastery of the free individual emerges
from the mastery of bodies). My last section draws on the particular
importance of gender and sex for understanding how black fungibility is
predicated on matrilineal inheritance laws under chattel slavery. As
such, [black fungibility is a spatial analytic]{.underline} of the [body
that resituates the bifurcation and disruptions between human and
animal,]{.underline} natural and cultural, life and non-life, evolution
and devolution, [origins and extinction,]{.underline} and self and other
[that are core to the particular yet repetitive geographies and
histories that render the captive body a universal metaphor of
value.]{.underline} As stated by Spillers, "the captive body... brings
into focus a gathering of social realities as well as a metaphor for
value so thoroughly interwoven in their literal and figurative emphases
that distinctions between them are virtually useless" (1987: 68). While
drawing on the work of Wynter, Hartman, Jackson, Spillers, and King in
overlapping and distinct ways, especially as it comes to gender and sex,
I take up all their work in terms of black feminism---as they all link
their positionalities as black women to their critique of actualizing
the "human." In turn, it is variegated conceptualizations of the
relation between race, gender/sex, and anti/blackness within black
feminism that constitute my framework for analyzing [the microbe-as the
unruly Other that constitutes the Human Self both externally and
internally.]{.underline}

#### Technology and calculation are rooted in the extermination of blackness via metaphysical calculation and false equality.

The event also put the metaphysical infrastructure into perspective for
me. Two philosophical forces were colluding (and at times conflicting)
to orient the solutions proposed and the audiences' responses, and both
presented "[free black" as a concept with meaning: black humanism and
postmetaphysics. I use these two terms to docket a certain posture
toward metaphysics---and the ontological ground metaphysics offers.
Black hu- manism enters into romance with metaphysics]{.underline}.
**[It appropriates schema- tization, calculation, technology,
probability, and universality---all the instruments of metaphysical
thinking---to make epistemological, ethical, and ontological claims
concerning blackness and freedom.]{.underline}** [Freedom is possible,
then, because metaphysics provides it with ontology**; from there, all
sorts of solutions, policies, and practices emerge to address
antiblackness. Scien- tific reasoning, technological innovation, and
legality are tools black hu- manists use to quantify suffering, measure
progress, proffer universal nar- ratives of humanity, and reason with
antiblack institutions.**]{.underline} All problems have solutions for
black humanists, and their task is to uncover the solution the problem
conceals, as this uncovering equates to an eradication of the problem.
Black humanism relies on an eclectic approach to antiblackness---
Hegelian synthesis, Kantian rationalism, Platonic universals/idealism,
Car- tesian representation, and empiricism. In short, black humanists
lay claim to the ~~being~~ of the human (and the human's freedom)
through metaphys- ical thinking and instruments. Postmetaphysics, in
contrast, attempts the surmounting or twisting \[verwunden\] of the
ground and logic of metaphysics.3 It insists that meta- physics
reproduces pain and misery and restricts human freedom. **[Rep-
resenting the human as an object of scientific thinking]{.underline}**
(e.g., **[biology, economics, law]{.underline}**) **[destroys the
spontaneity and uniqueness of the human]{.underline}**--- things that
make the human special. The ground, then, upon which meta- physics
relies is problematic, and this ground must be destroyed (i.e., twisted)
and deconstructed (i.e., displaced) to free the human. Postmeta- physics
would advocate for a self-consumption of this ground through
hermeneutical strategies, unending deconstructions, and forms of plu-
rality (such as hermeneutic nihilism). The post is rather a misnomer, if
we think of post as an overcoming \[überwunden\]; the postmetaphysician
will never overcome metaphysics. A residue will always remain, but the
postmetaphysician hopes to reduce this metaphysical residue to render it
inoperative. The postmetaphysician understands antiblackness as a prob-
lem of metaphysics, especially the way [**scientific thinking has
classified** ~~being~~ **along racial difference and biology.** The task
of the postmetaphysi- cal project is to free blacks from the misery
metaphysics produces by un- dermining its ground. Hermeneutical
strategies, which contest ultimate foundations, would question the
ground of race (racial metaphysics) and its claim to universal
truth]{.underline}. Black humanism and postmetaphysics, however, leave
the question of ~~being~~ unattended as it concerns black(ness). Both
assume ~~being~~ is ap- plicable and operative---black humanism relies
on metaphysical ~~being~~ and postmetaphysics relies on multiple
interpretations or manifestations of ~~being~~. In other words, the
human's ~~being~~ grounds both philosophical perspectives. Although
postmetaphysics allows for a capacious under- standing of the human and
~~being~~, it still posits ~~being~~ universally as it con- cerns
freedom; no entity is without it, even if it manifests differently, or
as difference, if we follow Deleuze. This is to suggest that both
discourses proceed as if the question of ~~being~~ has been settled and
that we no longer need to return to it---the question, indeed, has been
elided in critical dis- courses concerning blackness. Ontological Terror
seeks to put the ques- tion back in its proper place: at the center of
any discourse about ~~being~~. Ontological Terror meditates on this
[(non)relation between blackness and ~~being~~ by arguing that black
~~being~~ incarnates metaphysical nothing, the terror of metaphysics, in
an antiblack world. Blacks, then, have func- tion but not
~~being~~---the function of black(ness) is to give form to a ter-
rifying formlessness (nothing).]{.underline} ~~being~~ claims function
as its property (all functions rely on ~~being~~, according to this
logic, for philosophical presentation), but the aim of black nihilism is
to expose the unbridgeable rift between ~~being~~ and function for
blackness. The puzzle of blackness, then, is that it functions in an
antiblack world without ~~being~~---much like "nothing" functions
philosophically without our metaphysical under- standing of ~~being~~,
an extraordinary mystery. Put differently, metaphysics is obsessed with
both blackness and nothing, and the two become syn- onyms for that which
ruptures metaphysical organization and form. The Negro is black because
the Negro must assume the function of nothing in a metaphysical world.
The world needs this labor. This obsession, how- ever, also transforms
into hatred, since nothing is incorrigible---it shat- ters ontological
ground and security. **[Nothing terrifies metaphysics, and metaphysics
attempts to dominate it by turning nothing into an object of knowledge,
something it can dominate, analyze, calculate, and schema-
tize]{.underline}**. When I speak of function, I mean the projection of
nothing's terror onto black(ness) as a strategy of metaphysics' will to
power. How, then, does metaphysics dominate nothing? By objectifying
nothing through the black Negro. In this analysis, [**metaphysics can
never provide freedom or humanity for blacks, since it is the
objectification, domination, and extermination of blacks that keep the
metaphysical world intact**. **Metaphysics uses blacks to maintain a
sense of security and to sustain the fantasy of triumph---the triumph
over the nothing that limits human freedom.** Without blacks, I argue,
**nothing's terror debilitates metaphysical procedures, epistemolo-
gies, boundaries, and institutions**]{.underline}. Black freedom, then,
would constitute a form of world destruction, and this is [precisely
why]{.underline} [humanism has **failed to accomplish its romantic goals
of equality, justice, and recognition**.]{.underline} In short, black
humanism has neglected the relationship between black(ness) and nothing
in its yearning for belonging, acceptance, and freedom. The Negro was
invented to fulfill this function for metaphysics, and the hu- manist
dream of transforming invention into human ~~being~~ is continu- ally
deferred (because it is impossible). Ontological Terror challenges the
claim that blacks are human and can ground existence in the same
~~being~~ of the human. I argue that blacks are introduced into the
metaphysical world as available equipment in human form. Black thinking,
then, must return to the question of ~~being~~ and the relation between
this question and the antiblack violence sustaining the world. It is my
contention that black thinking is given a tremendous task: to approach
the ontological abyss and the metaphysical violence sustaining the
world. Ontological Terror suggests that black thinking cannot be
overcome--- we will never reach the end of black thinking or its
culmination, unlike the end of philosophy describing postmetaphysical
enterprises.4 In other words, postmetaphysics has broached the question
of ~~being~~ and has com- menced the destruction \[Destruktion\] of the
metaphysical infrastructure, which systemically forgets ~~being~~.
Postmetaphysics, then, is a project of remnants, as Santiago Zabala
suggests. [After we have used hermeneutics, deconstruction, rhizomes,
and mathematical sets to devastate metaphys- ics, we are left with
ontological rubble---a trace of metaphysics and a re- constructed
~~being~~.]{.underline} Postmetaphysics, then, must ask, "How is it
going with ~~being~~?" Or what is the state of ~~being~~ in this
contemporary moment, and how does the world remain open to ~~being~~'s
unfolding and happening (as well as its withdrawal and abandoning of
Dasein)? "How is it going with ~~being~~?" is the fundamental question
of our era, according to postmeta- physics; only the twisting and severe
rearranging \[verwunden\] of meta- physics can usher this question into
the world. Both metaphysics and postmetaphysics, however, have forgotten
the Ne- gro, just as they have forgotten ~~being~~---to remember
~~being~~ one must also re- member the Negro. The Negro Question and the
Question of ~~being~~ are in- tertwined. Postmetaphysical enterprises
reach a limit in destruction, since it is the Negro that sustains
metaphysics and enables the forgetting of Be- ing (i.e., metaphysics can
forget ~~being~~ because it uses the Negro to project nothing's terror
and forget ~~being~~). In a sense, the global use of the Negro fulfills
the ontological function of forgetting ~~being~~'s terror, majesty, and
incorrigibility. The consequence of this is that as long as
postmetaphysical enterprises leave the Negro unattended in their
thinking, it inadvertently sustains metaphysical pain and violence.
This, I argue, is why we will never overcome \[überwunden\] metaphysics
because the world cannot overcome the Negro---the world needs the Negro,
even as the world despises it. This is, of course, a Heideggerian
approach to the thinking of ~~being~~ and Nothing. More than any other
philosopher, Heidegger pursued metaphysical violence and the question of
~~being~~ relentlessly, and for this rea- son I find his philosophy
indispensable and necessary. Ontological Terror thinks with and against
Heidegger, since I believe Heidegger's destruc- tion of metaphysics can
assist black studies in the tremendous task of thinking ~~being~~ and
blackness, as Grant Farred has suggested.5 Heidegger's Destruktion
covers a wide range of philosophical issues, and it is not my objective
to address all of these complexities; my interest is the relation
between Heidegger's critique of metaphysical violence, available equip-
ment, and the task of remembering as it concerns blackness. What I hope
to broach in this book, with all the aporias such as broaching
encounters, is that the Negro is the missing element in Heidegger's
thinking (as well as in that of those postmetaphysicians indebted to
Heidegger, such as Jean- Luc Nancy, Giorgio Agamben, Alain Badiou, and
Gianni Vattimo). If, as we learn in ~~being~~ and Time, Dasein uses
tools to experience its thrown- ness in the world (establishing its
facticity) and to develop its [unique proj- ect oriented toward the
future (projectionality]{.underline}), the Negro---[as commod- ity,
object, slave, putative backdrop, prisoner, refugee, and
corpse]{.underline}---is the quintessential tool Dasein uses. The use of
the Negro metaphysically and ontologically, as a tool, is what black
thinking is tasked with pursuing. Thus, black thinking (and
postmetaphysics) must ask the unasked ques- tion "How is it going with
black ~~being~~?" Without broaching this question, [all forms of
destruction are just reconstitutions, since the world continues to use
the Negro (as black and nothing) to forget ~~being~~ and the sadistic
pleasure of this forgetfulness.]{.underline}

#### Scientific calculation within (artificial intelligence or biotechnology) is rooted in a anti-black desire to project nothing onto blackness whilst simultaneously disavowing it.

[Science abhors nothing]{.underline}. [It works tirelessly to avoid it,
to disavow it, to dominate and control it.]{.underline} [Metaphysical
procedures]{.underline} and practices [structure scientific
thinking---calculation, schematization, predictability, objecti-
fication, and numerical supremacy.]{.underline} But nothing resists such
metaphys- ical strictures, and because it is not capable of capture
within scientific webs, it is a horror. Heidegger claimed that nothing
is but "a horror and a phantasm" for scientific thinking. Nothing is a
monstrous thing, which, paradoxically, provides the condition of
possibility for scientific thinking. In other words, nothing is the
essence of science---the void, the abyss, the unruly thing is the
repressed ground of scientific inquiry. How do you quantify nothing? How
do you render nothing tangible, an object for observation? How do we
predict and isolate this nothing? How do we dif- ferentiate it from the
"something" metaphysics rules with an iron fist? Un- dergirding these
inquiries is the most horrifying of them all: why is there something
rather than nothing? Or what if there really is just nothing? In other
words, [science poses a proper metaphysical question through its
avoidance of nothing---a nothing it must disavow and embrace all at
once]{.underline}. But this is not the entire story. If for Heidegger
science is horrified of nothing and must repress this nothing to proceed
scientifically, then sci- ence has also found substitutes or embodied
projections of this nothing. In this way, [it comes close to the horror
of nothing but can remain at a safe distance by turning this nothing
into a something]{.underline}.1 This, I would argue, is the function of
black being for science. [Blackness enables a sci- entific encounter
with the horrors of an entity that is nothing and some- thing at the
same time]{.underline}. This brings us back to Alain David's childhood
riddle: "What is nothing while being something?" David's answer, of
course, is blackness. It is both nothing and something. This leads him
to inquire, "Why are Negroes black?"2 Scientifically, we can suggest
that Negroes are nothing incarnated because they are black. Much like
black holes and other scientific mysteries, blackness functions to index
the limit of science, that which it is unable to dominate through its
schematized reasoning.3 But with its will to power and its will to know,
metaphysical science still desires to engage this mystery, even though
it horrifies. We will present a few propositions that meditate on the
relation be- tween blackness, nothing, and science: (1) [**Science
projects nothing onto black bodies as a way to engage the horror and
disavow it simultaneously**.]{.underline} (2) [**Life and death lose
distinction and coherency for black being as nothing**. Once this
distinction is displaced or otherwise destabilized, the sci- entific
imagination is boundless in its conquest over blackness as
nothing]{.underline}. (3) [Science performs important philosophical work
in that it suspends the ethical relation to recast physical, emotional,
and spiritual torture as objective scientific methodology]{.underline}.
(4) [**Science is obsessed with conquering blackness---constantly
searching for ways to either eliminate it**, through practices such as
bleeding or rubbing away, or to keep it in a netherworld of horrors to
sustain brutality]{.underline}. (5) [Science relies on numeracy or the
cal- culating mind to carry out its brutal obsession. Numbers are not
neutral or innocuous but are weapons of pulverization and
subjection.]{.underline} (6) The discourse of insanity is a particularly
vicious framework for making on- tometaphysical arguments about
blackness. The free black will serve as our paradigm for understanding
the re- lation between science and black being. Antebellum society often
envi- sioned this nothing through the juxtaposition of freedom and
blackness. Freedom and blackness are recast, insidiously, as scientific
terms for the purpose of performing ontological work. Thus "free black"
provided a conceptual frame for applying scientific procedures to work
through an ontological crisis---what is this black thing? Is it
property? Is it human? Is it animal? Does it lack taxonomy? Is it
nothing? Dr. W. T. Wragg published "Remarkable Case of Mental
Alienation" in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal in 1846. He
informs us that he is treating a young Negro named Joe (twenty years of
age), and Joe has taken ill with "fever of a bilious type" on a
Charleston plantation. What stunned Dr. Wragg, however, was that Joe
pronounced himself dead, and word of his death traveled throughout the
city. Although Dr. Wragg claimed he was not dead but was, in fact,
living and breathing when he discovered him, "his case was of so serious
a character as to call for most careful at- tention." Joe became more
"delirious" and "pressed with the belief that he was dead." Dr. Wragg
initiated treatment of this "irrational contention," which was
predicated on "unsound premises." According to Dr. Wragg, "\[Joe\] said
that, being dead, his flesh would soon begin to rot and drop from his
bones; remonstrated at being kept so unburied; earnestly de- manded that
his grave clothes should be prepared and put upon him, and that he be
laid out in the usual form. He looked anxiously for the company to
assemble, which was to follow his body to the grave, and would chant in
touching language, a final adieu to his mother."4 Joe's delirium assumed
a joyous constitution as he sang songs and gave witness about his death
and burial. This troubled Dr. Wragg, and he diag- nosed Joe as having
"mental alienation," a fracture between a fantastical (or delirious)
perception of reality and reality itself (the "real world"). This
fracture, the irrational gulf between reason and the deadly imagination,
needed suturing. Dr. Wragg's treatment, then, proceeds to suture percep-
tion with reality---to use medical science to create a place for Joe
among the living, among human beings. Joe's cure entailed "repeated
bleeding, both general and local, blistering, purging, hot pediluvia
with mustard, and other means of depletion and deprivation," and as a
result "his mad- ness became more calm, but he never said anything
rational." I would suggest that Dr. Wragg used medical science to
address an ontometaphysical condition. The symptom treated is the
nihilistic an- swer to the proper ontometaphysical question "What is
black being?" Joe's answer to the question appears resolute: [**black
being is an always already dead thing**, and this thing is worldless.
**Although it might appear to be alive (within the precincts of biology
and scientific reasoning), this** life **is** but an illusion---**a
scientific/ontic illusion**]{.underline}. The black body is just an en-
casing for a primordial death (the destruction of the flesh,
thanatology). The black body, then, is a breathing tomb---a corporeal
casket, containing a primordial death. Joe's death is not a physical
death, however (we might call this, after Heidegger, "perishment").5 He
makes a distinction between death and the corrosion of the body
(perishment). Dr. Wragg's astonishment is really a misunderstanding; in
fact, the entire treatment procedure is predicated on a
fallacy---blurring the distinction between metaphysical death and
biological death---a blurring that is necessary as a form of disavowal,
a not seeing of the metaphysical destruction Joe endures. Thus, Joe's
self- diagnosis, his madness, is an ontometaphysical condition. He is,
indeed, already dead, awaiting his physical demise. Death is an
ontological mur- der. The body is the least of Joe's concerns (in fact,
he is all but happy to get rid of the corporeal casing). [The
metaphysical holocaust is a blind spot (anamorphic) to the scientific
eye and its hegemonic vision, despite its purported acuity]{.underline}.
Again, this is not a Heideggerian death---where [death is actually an
aperture onto life, authentic life with Being---but is an onti- cide, a
destruction of all ontological grounds and relation to
Being]{.underline}. What we have, then, is the limit of science and the
beyond it cannot fully broach, but can only medicalize away. Had Dr.
Wragg actually taken Joe seriously, actually listened to what
antiblackness muffles, he would understand that mental alienation is the
only condition possible for black being in an antiblack world. The term
alienation is but an inadequate placeholder for onticide, which severs
the flesh from the body. Science can neither suture nor cure this
fracturing. And it is this death, reconfigured as the nothing of a
metaphysical world, which constitutes the limit of sci- entific
thinking. Indeed, [this type of death is a horror for science, since it
is unable to transform it into an object of knowledge. This
untranslatability is recast as madness. Joe's madness is the nihilistic
condition of the metaphysical holocaust, of living in perpetual
obliteration]{.underline}. David Marriott provides a contrast to the
Heideggerian understanding of death (as the authentic opening up onto
Being through the mood anxiety). For Marriott, [black death is "having
lived without ever being truly alive; dead because never alive . . .
black life is meaningless and so black death is meaningless---a legacy
in which death is nothing . . . it is a death that cannot ever die
because it depends on the total degradation and disavowal of black
life]{.underline}. Ipso facto: death emerges as a transcendental fact of
black existence but without transcendence (similarly, black existence is
one condemned to live without the possibility of being) \[emphasis
mine\]."6 Black death is nothing (existence without the possibility of
being). It is not only that black death is nothing in the sense that it
is meaningless or pointless (rather than paving the way for human
freedom, it paves noth- ing), but also that it is metaphysical nothing,
an entity without being. Black death is the symbolic form of nothing
that Dr. Wragg could not understand (he needed to think
philosophically). For what he patholo- gized and attempted to treat was
nothing itself. Joe's pronouncement is really about this nothing and not
his physical perishment. He was never alive, and any life perceived is
erroneous. The treatment, then, inverts the ontometaphysical problem: if
Joe were to pronounce that he was alive and well, that would be a
disjuncture between reality and perception. Dr. Wragg's cure, then, is
the true symptom in the diagnosis. We might call Joe's ontometaphysical
condition "the already dead," following Eric Cazdyn. But in this case,
black death is a chronic condition of modernity, without cure.7 Abdul R.
JanMohamed would consider this disjuncture a "death bound subject,"
which constitutes "a zone between the status of 'flesh' and that of
'meat,' neither quite alive nor quite dead."8 Joe's body is meat, the
object of a rapacious, antiblack appetite. What is the ontologi- cal
status of this interstice between flesh and meat? Or, what is the status
of the zone of indistinction between metaphysical death and biological
life? This is the proper metaphysical question that science broaches
from a distance. We can also consider the "Remarkable Case of Mental
Alienation" as an allegory of sorts, or a paradigm for thinking science
with black being. For science cannot understand black death, or the
nothing that is black death. [When science reaches its limit, when its
episteme is unable to com- prehend, it diagnoses the impasse as madness.
Madness, I would argue, is the name for answering the proper
metaphysical question, nihilistically. One is mad because one is always
already dead, although appearing fully alive.]{.underline} Joe also
allegorizes the plight of black being: it is vulnerable to the
viciousness of scientific thinking and its devastating procedures.
Hortense Spillers identifies [medical science]{.underline} [as a
particularly terroristic field in relation to blackness]{.underline}.
Reading through the work of William Good- ell, she traces out the
[vicious profit motive, which creates an economy of selling and
purchasing diseased, damaged, incurable, disabled, and oth- erwise
worthless black bodies.]{.underline} She suggests, "**[This profitable
'atomizing' of the captive body provides another angle on the divided
flesh: we lose any hint or suggestion of a dimension of ethics, of
relatedness between human personality and its anatomical features,
between human person- ality and cultural institutions]{.underline}**. To
that extent, the procedures adopted for the captive flesh demarcate a
total objectification, as the entire captive community becomes a living
laboratory."9 What Spillers describes here is a metaphysical procedure:
what is to- tally objectified is more than just the captive's body. The
real object of analysis is nothing. (It is the attempt to make nothing
an object through the captive's abject body.) Thus, the essence of
science is not scientific.10 This nothing horrifies science, and,
consequently, the black body also horrifies science. This horror,
however, translates into both a will to know and a process of disavowal
(the Heideggerian conflict), and both reinforce/generate each other. In
other words, black bodies become living laboratories because these
bodies hold the secret of science---what it most wishes to know and what
it most wishes not to know. This play between knowing and not knowing,
desiring and detesting, hating and admiring would seem to land us in
Lacanian territory, something like a scientific unconscious. Science is
obsessed with this nothing---its limit and its pos- sibility. As
Heidegger asserted, when science attempts to explore its own essence, it
relies on this very nothing it rejects and detects for the explora-
tion.11 The atomizing Spillers describes is a philosophical procedure
under the guise of scientific objectivity. Andrew Curran would describe
this scientific atomization as a textu- alization of the African through
discourses such as anatomy.12 [Textualiz- ing the black body would
require a vicious hermeneutical-semiotic prac- tice of reading blackness
as a sign of abject nothingness. The black body, then, is a scientific
mediator of sorts between the dreaded nothing and a scientific field
determined to calculate, schematize, and dominate this nothing. This is
precisely why black being is so valuable to science: black being enables
the total suspension of limits (ethical, moral, and spiritual), and this
suspension leaves the scientific imagination unbounded in its antiblack
quest for knowledge, truth, and power.]{.underline} A living laboratory
has no rights that a white scientific mind is bound to respect, no
limitations on scientific creativity, and no resistance against
scientific objectification. As equipment in human form, black being
broaches infinity, nothing en- cased in a body. [Our aim, then, is to
understand the function of science in this metaphysical holocaust and to
dispel the myth of objectivity, which masks metaphysical cruelty behind
the auspices of scientific discovery. In its schematization, science
also relies on the mathematical mind and its procedures to give
numerical form to the formless---the infinite and the nothing.
**Katherine McKittrick calls this the "mathematics of un- livingness,"
where metaphysical thinking deploys numbers and calcula- tive thinking
to perpetuate the metaphysical holocaust.** This is to suggest that
numbers are weaponized against black being, mobilized to create a
destructive calculus]{.underline}. She understands the invention of
black being as emerging through numbers and the crude economy of
commerce: "This is where blackness comes from: the list, the breathless
numbers, the ab- solutely economic, the mathematics of the unliving."13
The purpose, then, of metaphysical arithmetic (schematized, calculative
thinking) is to pro- duce the unliving, the very death that Joe so
insisted to Dr. Wragg. Once situated on the ledger, financial documents,
and wills, black being is cast outside Dasein. These numbers provide
space to black being without an ontological place---this is how numbers
contribute to the metaphysical holocaust. Numbers conceal this
devastation behind purported objectiv- ity, but the number and its
calculus are far from innocuous. The ledger is precisely the reification
of this non-place (this nothing), and it is the way metaphysics can in
fact contend with it. Heidegger's critique of calculative thinking
entails the destructive use of numbers to quantify man, to restrict his
spontaneity and capture him in predictability.14 Badiou revisits this
critique and revises it to dethrone "1," which metaphysical philosophy
uses to understand the subject and being.15 We might say, following
Badiou, that "1" begins metaphysical vi- olence: man is reduced to this
"1," a quantifiable thing of science. But, if we read McKittrick through
Badiou's critique, we understand that the purpose of antiblack
schematization is to deny black being metaphysical "1." As an
ontological designator, [mathematics of the unliving must begin with
unending subtraction of the nonexistent---a calculus that takes us into
imaginary numbers, purely functional but lacking
tangibility]{.underline}.

## Cybersecurity:

#### Cybersecurity produces a digital infrastructure of information that increases racialized. nationalist and technocratic tendiences

How can we make sense of de Maizi\`ere's statement? In this paper, I
argue that [cybersecurity has become a key site in which states mobilize
science and engineering to produce state power in the digital
age]{.underline}. This is because the global and distributed nature of
Internet infrastructure challenges purely legal-bureaucratic or
political approaches to maintaining state sovereignty. Consider the
following example. Like many other administrations, the German state
depends on US-based technology, software, and services to run its
administration; most notably those provided by Microsoft. However,
because Microsoft data servers are controlled from US territory and are
subject to US law, the German state can never fully control data flows
from German to the United States and hence its own bureaucratic
apparatus. Microsoft's anti-piracy technology could also, in theory,
remotely revoke its licenses and thereby incapacitate the entire German
administration at the push of a button. [States' dependencies on
globally distributed information infrastructure]{.underline} thus
[create uncertainty about state sovereignty]{.underline}--- for example,
what data belong under German jurisdiction and which belong to the
US---as well as [a range of vulnerabilities that could be exploited for
purposes ranging from election hacking to cyberattacks on critical
infrastructure]{.underline}. This is the problem de Maizi\`ere refers to
in the quote above, and which he thinks requires "strong state
commitment": for the German state, [the materiality of information
infrastructure has become a key problem for state power]{.underline}.
The German state has responded to this problem with sweeping
mobilization of science and engineering to extend control over
information infrastructure, placing tasks of government into the hands
of scientists and engineers. In more general terms, [cybersecurity
problems]{.underline}---from Germany's struggle with Microsoft to the
US/Huawei dispute---[are primarily about problems of state
sovereignty]{.underline}. // Drawing on an analysis of the German
national Cybersecurity Strategy, I develop the concepts of
"territorialization projects" and "digital territory" to theorize how
the [production of state power in the digital age relies on
technoscientific expertise about information
infrastructure.]{.underline} The notion of "territorialization projects"
captures how states mobilize scientists and engineers in order to
transform globally distributed information infrastructure into bounded
national territory, [and how they invest it with patriotic meaning,
thereby making "digital territory]{.underline}." "Digital territory," in
other words, is nationalized information infrastructure. [It is
nationalized in both a material and moral sense because it includes
extending state control over the physical stuff of information
infrastructure and normative ideas about nation]{.underline}---[who is a
digital citizen, and who isn't; or what constitutes "good" and "bad"
digital citizens]{.underline}. In the German case, a combination of
nationalizing information infrastructure and placing statecraft into the
hands of scientists and engineers might indicate an emerging form of
"technonationalism"---[it displays both nationalist and technocratic
tendencies--- raising questions about the consequences of
territorialization projects for justice, democracy, and civic
life.]{.underline}

#### Surveillance under the guise of cyberoperations operates as a technique of privacy violation, that uniquely targets black folk.

While [surveillance can generate privacy violations]{.underline} and
harms to many people, [these]{.underline} harms and violations often
[disproportionately injure people from marginalized
populations.]{.underline} In her book Dark Matters, Simone Browne
surveys the long history of surveillance against Black people in
America, from the metaphor of slave ship as surveillance vessel to the
phenomenon of TSA officers searching Black women's hair. 42 As Browne
writes, ["Surveillance is nothing new to black folks. It is the fact of
antiblackness.]{.underline}"43 Other scholars have also researched the
disproportionate impact of government surveillance on Black and Brown
people, women,44 the poor,45 immigrants and undocumented people,46
people with disabilities, 47 and more. In The Poverty of Privacy Rights,
Khiara Bridges explains how poor mothers, especially Black and Brown
mothers, lack privacy protections.48 It is important to note that for
every marginalized group that suffers from disproportionate privacy
harms or civil rights violations, there are also individuals who belong
to more than one marginalized identity. Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw's
concept of intersectionality49 is key to understanding the
discriminatory ways in which the law has awarded privacy protections and
allowed for privacy violations. We must keep in mind the intersectional
dimensions of civil rights violations, as well as privacy violations, if
we are to work towards a theory of civil rights and privacy hen unequal
privacy protections involve targeted surveillance of people from
marginalized groups actively working to advance civil rights. For
example, the United States has a long history of surveilling potential
civil rights leaders, including civil rights legend Dr. Martin Luther
King.50 In the 1960s, [the FBI created COINTELPRO]{.underline} (an
abbreviation of Counter Intelligence Program) a program a[imed at
surveilling Black civil rights leaders in the height of the civil rights
movement]{.underline}.51 While modern Americans would likely like to
consider themselves much more progressive than pre-Civil Rights Movement
America, it is clear that things have not changed enough. [In 2017, a
whistleblower exposed another secret FBI program specifically aimed at
surveilling Black activists as "Black Identity
Extremists]{.underline}."52 Clearly, the battle for civil rights is not
over, and privacy rights are still not afforded to all on an equal
basis. Modern civil rights law in the United States attempts to prohibit
discrimination and equalize access to public accommodations and to
rights we believe to be fundamental. Civil rights laws are an attempt to
expose an inequity and remedy it. Today, our society faces a crisis of
privacy discrimination, in which people are unable to equally access
their privacy rights, and some face disproportionate privacy violation
harms. Privacy is not only a foundational civil liberty, but also a core
civil right as well. Conceiving of privacy as a civil liberty, without
understanding the interplay between privacy and equality, does a
disservice to both privacy and equality. As Alvaro Bedoya writes, "[When
we talk about privacy only as a civil liberty, we erase those patterns
of harm, that color of surveillance.]{.underline} And when we talk about
privacy only as a civil liberty, we also ignore the benefits of privacy:
Surveillance threatens vulnerable people fighting for equality. Privacy
is what protects them and makes it possible."53 When we talk about
privacy only as a civil liberty, we erase patterns of harm from privacy
violations that amount to or exacerbate discrimination and disparate
impacts on marginalized populations. For example, while surveillance can
lead to privacy violations and related harms for many people, these
harms are often worse for marginalized populations. Privacy conceived as
a civil liberty ignores the problems of unequal access to privacy and
ignores the necessary place privacy has in creating the conditions for
the fight for civil rights to continue.

#### Black Privacy good- but the aff's offensive cyber-security increases technologies of surveillance that historically target black communities.

It is now time to further extend these theories into the purely offline
realm. Today, [the line between the cyber and physical realms is
increasingly blurred]{.underline}. Moreover, extending the call for
cyber civil rights to the equal protection of privacy in both online and
offline spaces is a useful and cogent framework for the advancement of
civil rights. Civil rights laws create legal protections to prohibit
discrimination against individuals. Some civil rights laws can afford
individuals equal access to spaces and opportunities.71 Cyber civil
rights protections allow individuals equal access to online spaces and
opportunities. Between these two worlds is the world of
technologically-driven civil rights violations that exist neither purely
online or offline. One example of this is the phenomenon of [mass
surveillance, driven both by new technological dimensions of government
surveillance]{.underline} as well as increasing consumer-led
surveillance capitalism,72 [in which]{.underline} consumer driven
[networked technology products create webs of surveillance]{.underline}.
If a person is barred entry into a public space on the basis of a
protected characteristic, this could be considered a civil rights
violation under modern civil rights law, including the American With
Disability Act and the Civil Rights Act. 73 If a person is unable to
access an online space due to policies or practices that amount to
discrimination based on a protected characteristic, we can consider this
a cyber civil rights violation.74 What is particularly interesting about
the Citron and Franks approach to cyber civil rights, is the concept
that [barriers to equal access do not have to be
physical]{.underline}.75 Indeed, [policies and practices that allow for
behavior with discriminatory effects can effectively bar a person from
entry to an online space as a physical barrier in an offline
space]{.underline}. If a woman is refused entry into a public space due
to her gender, this could be a civil rights violation. (Imagine a
building with a sign saying, "Men only.") If a woman is unable to access
an online space, due to gendered harassment that makes the online space
uncomfortable or dangerous, this could be a cyber civil rights
violation. (Imagine a web forum rife with harassing posts targeted
toward women.) If a woman is unable to access an offline space due to
technological privacy violations that make the offline space
uncomfortable or dangerous, this, too, could be considered a civil
rights violation. (Imagine a public space with large, visible cameras
that record and stream to an open feed, with the promise that recorded
images will be uploaded to the internet.) The same theoretical framework
that could protect the expressive rights of individuals in an online
space can also aid in protecting the privacy and speech rights of
individuals in offline public spaces. In the past, one might conceive of
civil rights violations concerning public spaces or public
accommodations, and one could more easily separate the government and
private companies as actors in civil rights disputes. However, today,
with the advent of the internet and our increasingly connected world,
humanity faces a new space---cyberspace. [It can be difficult to
determine the boundaries of any particular space onli]{.underline}ne,
raising questions about what constitutes a public space, a public forum,
a space for public accommodation. 76 Protecting privacy is necessary to
protect civil rights, because much of our lives today are lived through
the means of technology. This is particularly apparent now during the
pandemic.77 Today, much of society works online, studies online, and
sometimes even celebrates and mourns and worships online. To some
extent, many people now spend much of their lives online. This
increasingly connected world is causing a series of context collapses,
78 as the line between physical and virtual space is further eroded.
While it is still necessary to protect privacy as appropriate for each
informational and social interactional context, 79 it is also possible
now to take the lessons from cyber civil rights and apply them to the
offline world as well.

#### Cybercrime is uniquely high in Africa now- the plan's funding of offensive cyberspace historically targets African regions and increases racial exploitation to developing nations.

Globally, [cybercrime has cost the economy between \$300 billion and \$1
trillion]{.underline}, or 0.4 to 1.4 percent of the global Gross
Domestic Product \[GDP\] (Farahbod, Shayo, & Varzandeh, 2020). Morgan
(2020) postulates that, globally, financial losses due cybercrime are
expected to increase by 15% each year over the next five years. At this
rate, it will hit an annual loss rate of \$10.5 trillion by 2025 \[R161
151 900 000 000,00\], which will be an increase from \$3 trillion \[R46
047 000 000 000,01\] in 2015. According to Bloomberg (Ransomware, 2021,
June), in 2020 cyberattacks amounted to global losses in excess of
\$1000 billion \[R15 349 000 000 000,00\] in 2020, while in that year
ransom demands (I.e. Ransomware) had escalated by 40% and malicious
Internet infiltration by more than 600% since 2019. These rates are
extremely worrisome if one considers that they occurred in a matter of
12 months only. Kshetri (2019) argues that [internet infiltration has
already reached an unacceptably high level in many African
economies]{.underline}. Economic [losses due to cybercrime represent the
most significant transfer of economic resources in history]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} crime jeopardises i[ncentives for innovation and
investment and the financial losses that it causes are much greater than
the cost of natural disasters in a single year]{.underline} (Morgan,
2020). Moreover, the [African economy\'s growing exposure to cybercrime
is a cause for concern]{.underline}, as [developing countries on this
continent are increasingly reliant on networked computer
systems]{.underline} (Peter, 2017). African countries also often lack
the infrastructure to counteract sophisticated cyberattacks. On this
continent economic activities utilising digital technology range from
data processing to a vast mosaic of social and economic activities,
including millions of daily online banking transactions, communications,
smartphone downloads of Television (TV) shows and music albums, as well
as initiatives like electronicgovernment (e-government)
-e-banking-e-health-e-learning, next-generation power grids, air traffic
control and other services (Peter, 2017:50). //[Despite the enormous
benefits of digital services for internet users worldwide, global
cyberspace exploitation]{.underline} by miscreants and criminals whose
activities on the Internet and whose impact on computer resources have
focused on wreaking havoc among legitimate consumers of such resources,
[has had a significantly adverse effect on]{.underline} the economy.
Extensive and advanced cybersecurity has thus become a crucial
requirement for safeguarding [the global economy]{.underline} and
governmental operations in order to ensure peace and security in all
spheres of life (Nwankwo & Ukaoha, 2019). The application of technical
solutions to combat cybercrime has always been the preferred option for
most cybersecurity experts. However, [most LEA in the African regions
are not equipped with the requisite technological knowledge while most
cybercriminals are experts in computer technology.]{.underline}
Therefore, the premise of this study rests on cybersecurity as a
response to combating cybercrime, to demystify the prevailing threats,
while offering recommendations to the African regions.

#### 

#### Cyberspace as a securitization tactic in international relations is structured by anti-black racism.

#### Howell 20 (Howell A, Richter-Montpetit M. Is securitization theory racist? Civilizationism, methodological whiteness, and antiblack thought in the Copenhagen School. Security Dialogue. 2020;51(1):3-22. doi:[10.1177/0967010619862921](https://doi.org/10.1177/0967010619862921))//GUCCISUSHI

Securitization theory has unquestionably made a significant impact. Its
founding texts are among the most widely cited international relations
scholarship (see Buzan and Wæver, 2003; Buzan et al., 1998; Wæver, 1995;
Wæver et al., 1993), spawning active research programs and new
'generations' of securitization theory. [The concept of securitization
has travelled to disciplines beyond international
relations]{.underline}, and even entered public discourse. What is so
appealing about this theory? Perhaps the most tempting aspect of
[securitization theory]{.underline} is its methodological rigor. It
[provides a clear set of steps and standards for identifying
how]{.underline} referent objects (e.g. migration, health,
[cyberspace]{.underline}) b[ecome security problems and deciding whether
they should indeed be 'securitized'.]{.underline} This ready made
methodology can be applied to all sorts of empirical areas. However,
students and scholars of security ought to resist this temptation of a
readymade approach and inquire more deeply into securitization theory's
core theoretical assumptions and methodology. This article argues that
[racist thought is fundamental and integral to classic securitization
theory's conceptual and methodological project.]{.underline} While other
scholarship has worked either to incorporate analysis of race into
securitization theory (Amin-Khan, 2012; Ibrahim, 2005; Mofette and
Vadasaria, 2016) or to overcome securitization theory's Eurocentrism
(Bilgin, 2010, 2011; Wilkinson, 2007), this article offers something
different. It is the first to excavate the foundations of securitization
theory in racist thought. We demonstrate that [classic securitization
theory is]{.underline} fundamentally and inextricably
[structured]{.underline} not only by Eurocentrism but also
[by]{.underline} civilizationism, methodological whiteness, and
[antiblack racism]{.underline}. What does it mean to excavate the racist
foundations of a theory? That we use the 'r-word' and white supremacy as
categories of analysis is sure to raise eyebrows. Even sympathetic
readers might wonder if the problem we identify is more appropriately
characterized as Eurocentrism. Critique of the Eurocentric character of
much Western scholarship and cultural production has made significant
inroads across academic disciplines, including international relations
(Hobson, 2012; Sabaratnam, 2013). Our analysis is inspired by this
research and extends some of its insights. Yet there is more to be said.
Black studies and decolonial scholarship demonstrate that much orthodox
and [critical Western social and political thought is predicated upon
epistemological and ontological premises that are not simply Eurocentric
but]{.underline} racist, specifically [white supremacist]{.underline}.
In international relations, recent debates have addressed the question
of whether postcolonial international relations should proceed solely
through an analytic of Eurocentrism or whether we need to more
specifically address racism and white supremacism (Gruffydd Jones, 2016;
Hozić, 2016; Rutazibwa, 2016; Sajed, 2016). Sajed (2016: 168) suggests
that the term 'Eurocentric' potentially neutralizes the foundational and
continuing racism of the discipline. Rutazibwa (2016: 192) asks, 'what
existing power structure does this reluctance \[to name racism\] serve?'
Echoing these concerns, we ask: What is at stake in the reluctance to
name racism in analyses of international security? Racism is a
fundamental system of power that has profoundly shaped the world for the
past several hundred years. Moreover, as is now well established,
[international relations emerged to provide intellectual support for the
imperial and (settler-)colonial ambitions of Western states]{.underline}
(Agathangelou and Ling, 2004a; Krishna, 2001; Vitalis, 2000, 2015).
Drawing on black studies, indigenous studies, and decolonial
scholarship, we illustrate the racist modes of thought that underpin
classic securitization theory by deploying three concepts beyond
Eurocentrism: civilizationism, methodological whiteness, and antiblack
racism.

#### Offensive cyber operations increase in multilateral responses sustains western global dominance that actively excludes African nations and reinforces racial lines of economic oppression.

In his work, The Cold War and the Colour, the historian Borstelmann
points out that the sluggish economic revival in Western Europe and
anxieties about the spread of communism in 1946 and 1947 softened
Truman's moral qualms about decolonization. Instead, [the United States
preferred to embrace colonial regimes]{.underline} in London, Paris,
Brussels, and Lisbon (Borstelmann 2003). The Marshall Plan and
[NATO,]{.underline} as Borstelmann argues[, "aimed to bolster the
economies and military forces of the metropolitan governments but also
served to strengthen them in their quest to retain control of valuable
colonies abroad"]{.underline} (Borstelmann 2003, Kindle Location 990).
[The United States]{.underline} actively [promoted Europe's recovery
after the Second World War. Yet it had]{.underline} all but [ignored
Africa at the end of colonialism. Africa's]{.underline} heavy
[dependence on commodities and reliance on the European market stunted
its development]{.underline} (Rodney, p. 192). This heavy reliance on
commodities, [which was further reinforced by neocolonial relations with
the West]{.underline}---and later China---[accentuated]{.underline}
Africa's economic vulnerabilities and [dependence on external
powers]{.underline}. As Hardt and Negri (2000, p. 43) have pointed out,
["The geographical and racial lines of oppression and
exploitation]{.underline} that were established during the era of
colonialism and imperialism [have]{.underline} in many respects not
declined but instead [increased exponentially."]{.underline} For
developing countries and Africa, the postwar era represents a long
period of marginalization and structural injustice. [The liberal
internationalist order]{.underline} is an order that not only
[benefitted Western]{.underline} Europe, Japan, and a handful of other
[countries]{.underline} that were America's client states [but also
actively excluded African countries from meaningful participation in
various multilateral institutions,]{.underline} including those that
established the norms for international monetary stability [and
reinforced the multilateral trading system]{.underline}. It was no
accident that by the 1970s, the triad power that shaped global
decision-making, for example on the international monetary system or the
multilateral trade agenda, was constituted by America, Europe (West
Germany), and Japan. In this book, I argue that this postwar order was
never faithfully lived out; thus, we should not lament its demise.//
[The liberal order]{.underline} was indeed successful for the Western
world and its allies during the Cold War, and it [helped to sustain US
global dominance. The same]{.underline} US-led liberal [order condemned
the Third World to the margins of the world economic
system.]{.underline} It is thus important that we recognize
[multilateralism]{.underline} for what it is---an incomplete project
that was, to a considerable extent, [was instrumentalized by dominant
powers to further their interests]{.underline}. Besides, the United
States has on many occasions betrayed its own ideals by propping up
military Juntas in Latin America, supporting morally questionable
leaders in Africa, and undermined efforts to consolidating democracy in
newly independent states. Woodward (1987) offers a comprehensive account
of US government's covert actions, from 1981 to 1987, through the
Central Intelligence Agency in the Middle East, Central America, and
Africa. For many decades, the United States presided over a world
trading system in which the Third World had to endure unfavorable terms
of trade and suffer the effects of both colonial and neocolonial
relations that perpetuated structural inequalities in production and
trade patterns. Indeed, the system generated positive outcomes for the
United States and its European allies. For Europe, the financing support
from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the
Marshall Plan, the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
[(NATO]{.underline}), and for Japan the Dodge Plan and [enhanced market
access in the United States for its merchandise goods, are all evidence
of the selective benefits of US largesse.]{.underline} As Strange (1988,
p. 104) point out, in a stretch of just over a decade from 1946 to 1988,
"[US aid and government loans]{.underline} to Europe amounted net to
\$25bn," and this [had a "pump-priming effect on infrastructural and
industrial investment in Africa,]{.underline}" with positive
psychological effects on business decisions. [This]{.underline} largesse
[pushed Europe to move faster in the direction of intra-regional trade
liberalization]{.underline}, ironically maintaining high import tariffs
against the United States. International cooperation through
multilateral bodies such as the UN, the World Bank, the IMF, and the
General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) had mixed results, and
these institutions were mainly in the service of the interests of major
powers. The areas of international cooperation that showed a greater
degree of success were, according to Anne-Marie Slaughter, those to do
with regulatory processes, including share of information around
anti-trust policy, environmental policy, criminal law enforcement, and
banking supervision (Slaughter 1997). Other areas related to
international tax treaties, accounting and reporting standards, other
standard-setting processes in the domains of international
communications technologies, counter-terrorist financing, and anti-money
laundering would also prove to be more concrete areas that fostered a
degree of normative convergence in ways that diffused benefits across
the world. But these produced limited gains that did not go far in
altering the global power imbalances. The liberal internationalist order
was never created with developing countries in mind and less so African
countries. [The peace and prosperity dividends that flowed out of open
trade did not benefit the African continent]{.underline} as much. Africa
was on the margins of the GATT processes until the Uruguay Round that
lasted between 1986 and 1994, which I discuss in detail in Chapter 3.
African countries have remained weakly integrated into production and
trade structures, even as advanced industrial economies warded off
developing countries' attempts to bring their development concerns to
the agenda of multilateral institutions such as the IMF and the World
Trade Organization (WTO). many African countries in their quest to
participate more meaningfully in the global economy. As such, [the
participation of developing countries in the US-led international order
has always been at the mercy of powerful countries.]{.underline} Even in
the twenty-first century, many developing countries and emerging
economies are still contesting the right to shape global institutions
and enhance their representation around the table as equals. For a long
time, they have been pushing for reforms in multilateral institutions
such as the United Nations Security Council and broadening
representation in global economic governance institutions such as the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

#### The research methodologies and colonial tendencies that over-determine western scholars in IR produces anti-black logics, that securitize African nation.

**Kwaku 2022** (Kwaku Danso, Kwesi Aning, African experiences and
alternativity in International Relations theorizing about
security, **[International Affairs]{.underline}**, Volume 98, Issue 1,

67--83, <https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiab204)//GUCCISUSHI>

[The discipline of]{.underline} International Relations
[(IR)]{.underline} and its security studies (SS) subfield have been
complicit in this endeavour. These areas of study [were developed within
the framework of western academic research to]{.underline} help
[minimize]{.underline} the incidence of [war and manage economic
relations among the powerful industrialized states]{.underline}.9 IR and
SS were also instrumental in providing intellectual support to the
colonial project in Africa and across other spaces and populations
conquered by Europeans.10 In spite of this partial focus, [the dominance
of whiteness intrinsic to IR]{.underline} and SS [leads to a claim of
universality]{.underline}, overlooking the fact that 'the experiences of
the conquered and colonized contrast with those of the conquerors and
colonizers'.11 [This]{.underline} pretension to universality 'mistakes
"Western" experiences for the universal',12 generating a parochial [view
of security]{.underline} that [rarely corresponds to the lived
experiences of African people]{.underline}.13 As Visoka observes,
'[most]{.underline} of the [international scholarship]{.underline} on
post-conflict societies [derives from]{.underline} an [unrepresentative
body of knowledge which tries to]{.underline} mediate, [deviate,
reinterpret and, consequently, construct a different social reality that
is interpreted through]{.underline} different measurements, reference
points, and [analytical concepts']{.underline}.14 As such, that
scholarship has become part of the problem, [rendering African
populations less secure]{.underline}. [The failure to acknowledge the
constitutive role of raciality]{.underline} and coloniality [in the
production and deployment of security knowledge has 'allowed the
proliferation of]{.underline} a literature on, for instance, "state
failure" that finds fault with some states (or their leaders/regimes)
but not with the global political--economic structure that \[either
encourages or\] allows them to "fail"'.15 This literature fails to
capture the context of hybridity in which security policies in most
African states are nested within and enacted by multiple orders claiming
to provide security, of which the state order is only one among many.16
It ignores, as we shall explain in detail below, the diversity of
non-state actors that intersect with the Weberian state to shape the
complex terrain of security governance in Africa, by either supporting
or contesting the authority of the legally constituted state. In the
process, the literature overlooks non-state or informal actors in their
ability to act as authoritative avenues for conflict transformation.
Insights from the critical IR/security literature at the margins of the
disciplines point out that conventional IR and SS do not wholly suffice
as settings for knowledge production and policy-making on African
security as they fail to capture the diverse array of non-state entities
that operate alongside the state to deliver security functions that are
otherwise thought of as primary obligations of the Weberian state.
[These disciplines are]{.underline}, therefore, [unable to offer
a]{.underline} way to [lasting peace and security in Africa]{.underline}
as they are hamstrung by their Eurocentric bias, and in some cases
actually do more harm than good. [To eschew Eurocentrism]{.underline}
and have relevance in African contexts, [IR and SS discourses require a
break from the dominance of whiteness and]{.underline}, hence, [the
hegemony of their colonial past]{.underline}. Indeed, Acharya and Buzan
are quite right to argue that IR and, for that matter, SS theorizing,
should be 'an open domain into which it is not unreasonable to expect
non-westerners to make a contribution at least proportional to the
degree that they are involved in its practice'.17 For that, an episteme
of alternativity that takes cognizance of the context of hybridity in
which a vast array of state and non-state actors outside the formal
arena interact to shape the security realities of people in Africa seems
necessary. As a step towards this endeavour, and drawing on insights
from postcolonial discourses and the episteme of alternativity, this
article reflects on the ways in which IR and SS have been responsible
for the production of a racialized mode of security knowledge that
dismisses the security experiences of people in African locales. The
article contends that the incorporation of African experiences and
understandings, as made manifest within the context of hybrid security
orders, into IR and SS scholarly and policy discourses around security
can elaborate the normative grounding of IR and broaden its empirical
base for theorizing about security, since they offer a perspective
outside the [conventional western assumptions]{.underline} and points of
reference. Following this introduction, the article discusses the racial
status quo of IR and SS from the perspective of methodological
whiteness. It then moves on to [illustrate the dominance of whiteness
prevalent in approaches to insecurities in Africa by]{.underline}
analysing [the 'global war on terror' and the politics of threat
construction in the Sahel region of Africa]{.underline}. Finally, it
engages the episteme of alternativity from the perspective of orality
and hybrid security orders to explore the possibility for alternative
modes of signification that might elaborate IR and SS as a whole by
providing alternative reference points for generating security knowledge
and informing practice.

#### Offensive cyber operations operate under racialized constructions of threat that mystify the terroristic nature of globalized white supremacy. 

#### Meier 21 (Meier, Anna A. The Idea of Terror: White Supremacist Violence and the Making of Counterterrorism. The University of Wisconsin-Madison, 2021.)//GUCCISUSHI

Examining how white-majority countries undertake counterterrorism, and
how they constitute what counts as "terrorism" by doing so, requires
also considering the sorts of acts and actors not typically considered
as terrorist threats---in these contexts, white supremacist violence.
Unfortunately, there is much terrorism scholars do not know about
government responses to white supremacist violence and how policy
decisions to address such acts and actors are made. This is in part
[because terrorism scholars have historically not thought]{.underline}
much [about white supremacist violence as terrorism.]{.underline} This
is not because such violence is new. [Many countries have]{.underline}
indeed [experienced a recent surge in far-right activism]{.underline},
which in turn has spawned numerous new violent political actors. Yet
[these actors did not appear out of the ether, but]{.underline} rather
[have roots in older sources of violence]{.underline} and connections to
older violent organizations that laid considerable groundwork. Rich
historical accounts of far-right and white supremacist activity in the
United States (Belew 2018), Germany (Rabert 1995; Kohler ¨ 2016b), and
throughout Europe (Bjorgo 1995) emphasize that far-right violence,
rather than being a series of isolated incidents by "lone wolves," is
frequently part of a larger organized movement that looks to and lauds
predecessor organizations in crafting goals and messaging. Still,
terrorism scholars have chosen to focus overwhelmingly on violence of
other ideological stripes (Simi 2010). A commonly offered explanation
for [this]{.underline} choice [is the relationship between terrorism
research and state interests]{.underline} (and state funding), [leading
to under-examinations of right-wing violence]{.underline} in particular
(Schuurman 2019). In a review of all articles published between 2007 and
2016 in nine English-language terrorism studies journals, Schuurman
(2019) found that 74.5% dealt with "jihadist" groups and individuals;
only 1.9% examined right-wing activity. As noted above, this is not
because right-wing violence did not occur prior to 2016---and while
spectacular attacks by al-Qaeda and the Islamic State may have rightly
attracted considerable attention, the disparity in research focus is
still enormous. Similar patterns evinced themselves in earlier
literature reviews: between 2001 and 2007, some 57.3% of terrorism
research was focused on Islamist violence (Silke 2007). In other words,
the disparity in focus on Islamist vs. other kinds of violence has grown
over time. It should be noted that social scientists have done
considerable work on white supremacist activity. Scholars of the far
right have written extensively on white supremacist ideologies in
far-right political parties (Mudde 2016), social movements (Blee &
Creasap 2010), youth cultures (Miller-Idriss 2018), and online
communities (Simi & Futrell 2006; Daniels 2009; Caren et al. 2012).
Far-right violence has also received extensive treatment (Koopmans &
Olzak 2004; Adamczyk et al. 2014; Bencek & Strasheim ˇ 2016; Klein &
Muis 2019; Durham 2008; Miller-Idriss 2020a). Still, [these ideological
movements and their accompanying violence are rarely described in
scholarly work as terrorism. This semantic choice matters: it minimizes
conversations between work on white supremacist violence and other types
of extremist violence more frequently called "terrorism," stifling
opportunities to see whether theories and findings travel across
ideological persuasions.]{.underline} Siloing studies of far-right and
white supremacist violence also furthers the idea that white supremacist
violence perhaps should not be placed in the same category as other
kinds of "terrorism"; while a normative consideration, it is not clear
that there is any objective reason, in terms of goals or tactics, not to
place white supremacist violence under the "terrorist" umbrella. Recent
work by terrorism scholars has offered correctives.3 Perliger (2020)
details the history of white nationalist violence in the United States,
presenting it firmly as a problematique for terrorism studies; K ´ ohler
( ¨ 2016a) offers a similar accounting in Europe. Piazza (2017) and
Ravndal (2018) consider determinants of right-wing terrorism in a
classic exploration of country-level economic and political issues,
while Michael (2019) examines strategic reasons right-wing actors use
terrorism, contributing to a long line of work that views terrorism as a
distinct tactic.4 These are the same sorts of foundational questions
that the broader terrorism literature has explored vis-a-vis Islamist
violence \` for decades, and so there is much catching up to do.
Accordingly, one contribution of this dissertation is purely
informative: I provide descriptive data on white supremacist violence in
Germany and the United States, foundations upon which future researchers
can build. But [my substantive contribution to a growing literature on
white supremacist violenc]{.underline}e within the terrorism studies
canon also goes beyond this. Notably, I [shift focus to government
responses to white supremacist violence]{.underline}---responses [that
might be called "counterterrorism" if they were directed against
different types of actors]{.underline}. As with research on white
supremacist violence in general, work on countering white supremacist
violence is only slowly starting to appear. Much of this work is
prescriptive, suggesting strategies that might be effective after laying
out the scope of the threat (Kohler ¨ 2019; Blackbourn et al. 2019;
Chermak et al. 2009).5 This stands in contrast to approaches in the
broader counterterrorism literature, which has developed theories and
models of when and how governments will choose various counterterrorism
strategies while assuming a homogenous category of "terrorist" actors,
ignoring differential levels of threat posed not only by tactics, but by
particular political claims on the state (Enders & Sandler 1993; Sandler
2015; Kydd 2011; Pokalova 2015).

### Digital/molecular bioptx -- Howell & Richter-Montpetit 19

#### The new information and technology age require the retheorization of securitization into a digitalized biopolitics that makes the theorization of race and coloniality impossible. 

**Howell and Richter-Montpetit 19** (Alison Howell, Rutgers University
-- Newark AND Melanie Richter-Montpetit, University of Sussex "Racism in
Foucauldian Security Studies: Biopolitics, Liberal War, and the
Whitewashing of Colonial and Racial Violence" International Political
Sociology (2019) 13, 2--19)

[Molecular and Digital Revolutions and the Whiteness of Post-human Life
FSS's undertheorization of racism and colonialism]{.underline} also
[produces inaccurate genealogies of (life) sciences and technologies,
most strikingly regarding the]{.underline} so-called [**digital** and
**molecular** revolutions]{.underline}. FSS [scholars]{.underline} of
these revolutions [purport]{.underline} to [update Foucault for "the
**age of life as information**"]{.underline} (Dillon and Reid 2009, 106)
[and to describe epochal breaks in scientific understandings of life,
corresponding with an equally epochal shift from a biopolitics of
scientific racism to a new postracial form of biopolitics. However, they
do so without any serious attention to]{.underline} Foucault's
postcolonial critics or any serious inquiry into [lines of continuity
between **White supremacist scientific racism** and **these digital and
molecular "revolutions."**]{.underline} Thus, for instance, Dillon and
Lobo-Guerrero (2008, 273) argue that "biopolitics is critically
dependent, epistemically and ontologically, on what the sciences of life
say that species life is." As such, "\[i\]n the molecular age life is no
longer simply the life of population as Foucault documented . . .
because molecular science has transformed what we understand a living
thing to be" (Dillon and Lobo-Guerrero 2008, 286). Dillon and Reid
similarly claim to trace shifting notions of life. They assert that over
the past five decades "the very ontology of biological life has shifted
to the ground of 'information'" (Dillon and Reid 2009, 22) and that
distinctions between animate and inanimate, biological and nonbiological
"have been newly construed and problematized" (Dillon and Reid 2009,
22). Though much of this is derivative of Ian Hacking and Nikolas Rose's
work, attention to the digital and molecular has particular impacts in
the international and security fields. According to Dillon and Reid
(2009, 22), digital and molecular "reproblematizations" of life have
impacted the biopolitical strategies of liberal internationalism:
"\[t\]he very space of enmity is itself re-problematized. Who is
dangerous, what is dangerous, how things become dangerous are all
transformed" (Dillon and Reid 2009, 107). This has apparently resulted
in a shift from scientific racism to "new racism," with an emphasis on
cultural difference rather than biological hierarchies. [FSS's ability
to examine how science has shaped the biopolitical strategies of
security and liberal internationalism is limited by its **persistent
Eurocentrism** and **undertheorization of race**. Societal notions of
"life" are treated as interchangeable with the life sciences' supposedly
**postracial understanding of life as**]{.underline} generic [**data**.
This fails to engage with either the **ingrained (settler) coloniality
of technoscience** or the **stubborn (and institutionalized) persistence
of broader structures of White supremacy and anti-Blackness**. This has
serious]{.underline} empirical [implications.]{.underline} For instance,
[Dillon's discussion of "new" risk analysis and biometrics does not
consider how these security technologies have been designed to **police
enslaved populations** and **surveille Black people**]{.underline} (cf.
Browne 2015), [as part of a long-standing legacy of **colonial
techniques of "identity dominance"**]{.underline} (Bell 2013).
Similarly, [FSS discussions of the molecular fail to engage with the
contemporary racial politics of genetic science]{.underline} (Duster
2003; TallBear 2013; Nelson 2016); [how molecular life sciences were and
are fueled by **experimentation on the bodies of racialized and
indigenous people**]{.underline} (Washington 2006; Dudley 2012; Mosby
2013), [including the movement of pharmaceutical clinical trials from US
prisons to the Global South]{.underline} (Petryna 2009); [or the
**neo-eugenic functions of genetic reproductive
technologies**]{.underline} (Roberts 2011, 2013) [and related racialized
economies of labor in the global surrogacy industry]{.underline} (Twine
2011) to name just a few examples. Instead, highly [**abstract
formulations** stand in for historically specific forms of
power]{.underline}. Dillon and Reid write that "\[p\]ower is
palimpsestuous. New forms and relations of power become superimposed on
older ones. Previous relations and accounts of power are rubbed out but
may not be entirely effaced" (Dillon and Reid 2009, 124). This statement
comes with no serious empirical engagement with the persistence---and
modulation---of scientific racism into the twenty-first century. Instead
[we are to believe that racism is now **cultural, not
scientific**]{.underline}---and, for that matter, [**that science itself
isn't cultural**. The result is an **e(race)sure**]{.underline} (Moore
2012) [of the ways that racialized subjects continue to always already
signify violence that once again **shores up the foundational White FSS
mythology** that everyone is (**potentially**) **dangerous** and,
therefore, **vulnerable** to the punitive and/or lethal dimensions of
liberal power.]{.underline} Ironically, [FSS discussions of post--WWII
biopolitical liberal internationalism]{.underline} thus [reproduce,
rather than challenge, the promise that liberal war will **transcend the
global color line**]{.underline} (Richter-Montpetit 2014b).

### AI -- Schelenz 22

#### AI neural networks are undergirded by racial bias and white representation. "Objective" computer models reify racial sterotypes and tropes. 

**Schelenz 22** (Laura, conducts research on ethical and feminist
perspectives on technology development. In her dissertation at the

[In the context of AI, Black women are affected by various unjust
situations and structures]{.underline}. On the one hand, [they are
**impacted by design architectures and algorithmic networks that have
been found to exhibit bias against BIWOC. This bias can be traced to an
overrepresentation of White male perspectives**]{.underline} in datasets
and design teams (Buolamwini and Gebru

Zou and Schiebinger
[2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR67)).
Since [**computer models are increasingly used to make decisions that
can determine subjects' paths in life**,]{.underline} such as decisions
about loans, hiring, college admission, and even parole (O'Neil
[2016](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR48)),
[algorithmic bias can reinforce and intensify the structural oppression
of BIWOC. On the other hand, the economic and political frameworks of
the production and use of AI contribute to the oppression of Black
women.]{.underline} The operation of [AI-based tools relies on
the]{.underline} recruitment (and [exploitation) of low-wage, low-skill
workers in the Global South]{.underline} (Gray and Suri
[2019](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR27)).
Data flows freely and is mined with little regard for data protection
(Zuboff
[2019](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR68)),
especially stripping poor people of their privacy rights (Bridges
[2017](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR9)).
This ecosystem of AI-powered services remains largely unregulated and is
further legitimized by the commonly held belief that AI-based technology
is neutral and fairer in its decision-making than humans (Benjamin
[2019a](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR5),
pp. 11 and 22). Economic Oppression This section highlights two trends
in the digital economy that can add to the marginalization of BIWOC.
Concerning the first trend, AI is increasingly used for the automation
of hiring decisions and recruitment, especially by large employers.
Applications and CVs are pre-scanned by a software to distinguish
suitable from unsuitable candidates (Poster
[2019](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR49),
p. 139). This pre-selection of candidates is done without human
oversight. Amazon stopped the usage of a hiring software after the
company found that it exhibited gender bias by favoring male over female
applicants (Reuters
[2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR51)).
The biased algorithm was trained on data from the last 10 years of
applications at Amazon. Given societal inequalities that lead to a
dominance of men in STEM fields and the technology industry, the
algorithms had learned that a probable candidate for Amazon is male.
Other forms of bias exist in online freelance marketplaces (e.g.,
TaskRabbit or Fiverr), which match employers with workers (Poster
[2019](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR49),
p. 139). In these platforms, AI-based algorithms suggest a list of
suitable workers to employers who want to tap the online pool of
workers. Hannák et al.
([2017](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR30))
show that these rankings can disadvantage Black women because of gender
and racial biases. In effect, users who are perceived to be Black women
are ranked lower than candidates from other social groups. They thus do
not appear on the radar of employers or they are considered less
skilled. According to Hannák et al.
([2017](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR30)),
this bias originates in the ratings and reviews from employers. Users
who are read as Black and/or female get fewer and lower ratings, and
written feedback contains fewer and less positive adjectives than for
other groups (p. 1927). These biases are especially damaging if we
consider surging corporate calls for the inclusion of Black women in the
digital economy. Big tech companies increasingly fund programs for
marginalized girls that seem to address structural inequalities. These
programs, of which the Google-funded Black Girls Code is a good example,
educate and empower participants to become programmers (Noble
[2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR47),
64f). It is then a big irony if not an insult that companies calling for
Black women's inclusion produce and proliferate AI-powered recruitment
tools that disadvantage Black women. It is also concerning that big tech
companies target Black women for recruitment into an exploitative job
market, which leads us to the second worrisome trend. Contrary to
scenarios where machines replace humans, human labor is still required
for the development of AI-based technologies. In fact, the digital
economy has produced a set of new jobs. This is what Gray and Suri
([2019](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR27))
call the "paradox of automation's last mile": the more we use AI, the
more we rely on humans (xxii). For instance, social media platforms rely
on human intervention for "cleaning" the platform. This means that
workers in low-wage jobs, working out of computer centers in the Global
South, manually review images and videos to decide whether the content
should be removed (Cherry
[2016](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR14),
p. 71; Block and Riesewieck
[2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR6)).
From curating datasets to labeling images for an online shop, tech
companies rely on "the power of the crowd" and distribute small tasks to
thousands of workers via platforms such as Amazon Mechanical
Turk[Footnote4](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#Fn4)
(Cherry
[2016](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR14),
p. 76). These tasks help train machine learning algorithms and produce
AI-based products. Given the history of massive low-wage employment of
immigrant and women of color in the technology industry (Hossfeld
[1995](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR34),
p. 408; Gillard et al.
[2010](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR25)),
these new precarious home-based jobs are likely held by the same group.
They pay little taxable income and workers have little or no rights.
Clients, however, can determine criteria for candidates, accept or
reject the work product, and review the workers (Cherry
[2016](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR14),
p. 76). Crowdsourcing jobs are still unregulated (Cahn et al.
[2019](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR12),
p. 8), and it remains unsolved whether workers count as "independent
contractors" or "employees" (Cherry
[2016](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR14),
p. 76). There are no benefits, no mentorship, and no remedy if technical
matters prevent the worker from fulfilling a task (Cahn et al.
[2019](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR12),
p. 8; Gray and Suri
[2019](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR27),
xxiv ff). Finally, the current set-up of the digital economy follows a
neoliberal capitalist framework (Zuboff
[2019](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR68)),
which tends to manifest global inequalities including "digital
colonialism." First, the raw material (e.g., coltan) for digital
technologies is extracted from conflict regions in the Congo with little
consumer awareness of local human rights abuses (Noble
[2016](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR46)).
Second, digital technologies produced in Silicon Valley are exported to
geographically and culturally different contexts without attention to
local norms and values (Wakunuma and Masika
[2017](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR60)).
Third, workers in low-income regions of the Global South perform
customer services for American consumers and are forced to fake a White
identity from names to accents and greetings (Poster
[2019](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR49),
p. 152). Hence, White privilege and supremacy are upheld at the expense
of non-White lives and identities. Existing hierarchies become
solidified. White supremacy is also at the heart of political projects
of oppression. Political Oppression AI-based innovations can lead to the
political oppression of BIWOC. One source of discontent is the practice
of [AI-based surveillance]{.underline}. Historically, [technologies have
been used to enhance practices of "social sorting]{.underline}" (Lyon
[2003](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR71)).
[They help categorize and classify people in order to make
decisions.]{.underline} In society, such classifications [usually occur
subconsciously and involve stereotypical ideas about other
people]{.underline} (Goffman
[1990](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR26)).
We sort those we encounter into categories (male or female, White or
Black) because we expect to know better whom we are dealing with. In a
similar way, AI-based tools today "sort out" who is potentially
dangerous (e.g., in law enforcement or criminal justice) and who is
eligible for welfare benefits or a suitable candidate for college
admissions, insurance, and loans (O\'Neil
[2016](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR48);
Angwin et al.
[2016](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR1)).
One prominent case study is facial recognition technology, which is used
by law enforcement to identify suspects. In an intersectional study of
facial recognition algorithms, Buolamwini and Gebru
([2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR11))
find that lighter and male faces are better recognized (or classified)
than darker and female faces. The algorithms investigated in the study
performed worse on Black and Brown women, often wrongly classifying them
as male (Buolamwini and Gebru
[2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR11),
p. 10). **[Given the use of the technology in policing, algorithmic bias
may result in Black and Brown women being wrongfully arrested and
convicted more often than Whites. In the context of widespread police
brutality against Black people in the United States]{.underline}**
(Hinton
[2021](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR32);
Ritchie
[2017](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR53)),
**[algorithmic bias in facial recognition technology has serious
implications for the free movement and safety of Black
women.]{.underline}** Another source of concern is the treatment of race
and gender in the design of AI. On the one hand, technology has been
considered neutral to race and gender because of disembodiment in the
digital sphere. Especially on the Internet---so the story
goes---everyone can be and do what they want (Daniels
[2015](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR21),
p. 1381). Such attitudes follow a color-blind worldview, which allows
White people to ignore structural inequalities by reference to
universalism and equality ("I don't see race because we are all equal";
Bonilla-Silva
[2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR7)).
Yet, color-blindness ignores the genealogy of cyberspace (e.g.,
dominance of a White male perspective) as well as the visual culture
online (Daniels
[2015](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR21),
p. 1378,
[2009](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR20),
p. 19). As a result of color-blind approaches, designers have paid
little or no attention to racial inequalities in or through technology
(Benjamin
[2019a](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR5),
p. 63). On the other hand, designers increasingly aim at personalizing
services to different users and therefore consider race and gender as
distinguishing features of users. Although this is where color-blindness
apparently ends, designers still consider the use of gender and racial
categories neutral because technology is continuously seen as neutral.
Consequently, categories of race and gender become legitimate tools of
classification in AI-based technologies without attention to the
structural inequalities that they represent and reinforce (Benjamin
[2019a](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR5),
p. 21). In the field of Machine Learning Fairness, race and gender are
widely used as variables to ensure an equal outcome of algorithmic
decisions for diverse groups. While the goal seems like a step in the
right direction, the use of race and gender as descriptive demographic
categories obscures their historical and normative baggage and social
construction. It ignores the way these categories have been used in
political projects of oppression, for instance in the early US census,
where African-Americans were not counted properly to privilege White
people (Hanna et al.
[2020](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR29)).
In fact, gender and race categories continue to be used as tools
(technologies even) to manage access to political influence and restrict
some groups' human rights, as the example of racialized voter targeting
by the Trump campaign 2016 shows (Sabbagh
[2020](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR54)).
A third aspect worth mentioning here is the proliferation of hate speech
and White supremacist content with little regulation on behalf of social
media companies and the government. While companies claim to prioritize
racism online and may hire a Black spokesperson, even obvious racial
aggression remains visible in social media networks (Benjamin
[2019a](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR5),
p. 29). There are immediate and more subtle consequences of this lack of
regulation. One is the translation of online hate into physical attacks
against Black women (Daniels
[2009](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR20),
p. 7). Another consequence is the slow erosion of accepted rights and
political processes because White supremacists provide "alternative"
interpretations of historical events such as slavery. Shielded by
anonymity on the Internet, they question established values and ideals
such as equality, insinuating that one can have an opinion on racism (as
opposed to racism is prohibited by law and goes against democratic
values, Daniels
[2009](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR20),
p. 8). Cultural Oppression. This section traces the [oppression of Black
women through AI-mediated representations.]{.underline} Symbolism and
cultural imagination of identities play a crucial role in upholding or
dismantling social hierarchies. Throughout American history and in
contemporary media, [racist and sexist stereotypes of Black women have
geared to their perception as inferior]{.underline} (Gammage
[2017](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR24)).
[AI systems can reinforce such harmful representations, for example
through the racialized representation of robots.]{.underline} Cave and
Dihal
([2020](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR13))
show that imaginations of AI in films, drawings, and stories are
overwhelmingly racialized as White. Humanoid robots and other machines
(such as chatbots) carry physical features that resemble a White face,
and voice assistants use standard middle-class American English instead
of African-American Vernacular English. The robot "Sophia" from Hanson
Robotics is an example that enjoys big popularity in society and popular
culture (Cave and Dihal
[2020](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR13),
Fig. 1). This racialization of AI as White has implications. It can
unconsciously convey the notion that technology design and development
are only for White people. It can further reinforce racial hierarchies
that position machines over Black people as much as White people over
Black people (Cave and Dihal
[2020](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR13)).
A study by Bartneck et al.
([2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR3))
indeed shows that consumers attribute race to differently colored robots
and exhibit bias toward those robots associated with Black male
identities. Bias in the representation of AI may be unconscious or
intentional. Designers who are White may consider a pale skin color as
neutral and normal, thus unconsciously choosing this design for their
robotic creation (Cave and Dihal
[2020](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR13),
p. 10). However, Benjamin
([2019a](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR5))
questions whether the representation of robots as White is so
unintentional. She discusses an advertisement from the 1960s which
paints the picture of a robot as a dehumanized servant, whereas the ad
reads: "Slavery will be back" and "Slavery will be here to stay" (p. 57,
Fig. 1.2). [In the past leading to the present, imaginations of robots
by White people often involved a desire to dehumanize and command
inferior "beings"]{.underline} (Benjamin
[2019a](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR5),
p. 56). [This resembles White attitudes during slavery, when Black women
were forced to work not only in the cotton fields but also as servants
in the household]{.underline} (hooks
[2015](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR33),
24ff). Going a step further, [the Whiteness of robots may also be an
intentional move toward an imagined White utopia]{.underline}, in which
BIWOC as domestic workers are entirely removed from the White family's
home (Cave and Dihal
[2020](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR13),
p. 14; Rhee
[2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR52),
p. 94). Another case of stereotyping of Black women through AI concerns
search engines like Google. Noble
([2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR47))
investigates "the ways in which search engine results perpetuate
particular narratives that reflect historically uneven distributions of
power in society" (p. 71). Analyzing Google searches of the keyword
"Black girls," she shows how the [racialized sexualization and
commodification of Black girls resembles broader narratives about Black
women in US society]{.underline}. In an initial search of the term in
2011, Noble
([2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR47))
notices that the websites at the top of the search results advertise
(free) porn or sex with Black women (cf. Figure
[2.1](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_2), p. 67). Even dating
sites represent Black women (or "girls") as hypersexualized.
Unsurprisingly, Google searches for girls of any ethnicity generate
similar search results (Noble
[2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR47),
p. 71). However, [given the history of Black women's representation in
American media, their continued and exacerbated misrepresentation
through AI is particularly concerning]{.underline} (Harris-Perry
[2013](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR31)).
Noble
([2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR47))
briefly hints at the [historical construction of Black women as
Jezebels, Sapphires, and Mammies]{.underline} (p. 98). These [images
have their origin during the enslavement of African people]{.underline}.
On the one hand, Black women were perceived as exotic and desirable sex
objects that were particularly wanton compared to White women. They were
the subject of gruesome sexual abuse by White slave owners and even
after the end of slavery, White men widely raped Black women (hooks
[2015](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR33),
58ff). On the other hand, Black women were represented as Mammies or
matriarchs. The "iconic" Aunt Jemima pancake brand popularized the image
of the old and unattractive Black woman who happily serves the White
family (hooks
[2015](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR33),
84f). As a matriarch, the Black woman is considered head of the own
household, stripping her husband of his masculinity. Hence, as hooks
([2015](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR33))
puts it: "Just as Whites used the myth that all black women were
sexually loose as a way to devalue black womanhood, they used the
matriarchy myth to impress upon the consciousness of all Americans that
black women were masculinized, castrating, ball-busters" (80f). Some of
these stereotypes are still used today, especially in movies and popular
culture (West
[2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR62)).
While stereotypes in classic media contribute to the cultural oppression
of Black women, the case of online search engines is a particular one.
Search engines are gatekeepers of information (Bozdag
[2013](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR8),
p. 209). They have the power to define and signify sometimes ambiguous
concepts. Furthermore, search engines like Google enjoy the standing of
a legitimate and neutral source of information, expressed by the saying
"just Google it" (Noble
[2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR47),
p. 85). They are even used in high schools and higher education for
assignments or research. If we encounter biased information around a
subject that is new to us, we may accept the information as truth and
reality (Noble
[2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR47),
p. 65). With the enormous reach of Google and YouTube, these services
have the power to control representations of concepts and identities.
This is concerning not just because of the concentration of power in the
hands of a few (predominantly White and male) designers situated in
Silicon Valley, but due to a capitalist framework. The representation of
knowledge and identities is thus bound by private commercial interests
rather than public democratic values (Noble
[2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88615-8_11#ref-CR47),
91f).

### AI -- Dancy 21

#### Blackness as a signifier of dereliction within AI systems is endlessly disavowed by structures of knowing, thinking, and modeling. 

**Dancy 21** (Christopher L, Associate Professor of Industrial &
Manufacturing Engineering and of Computer Science & Engineering @ Penn
State. "AI and Blackness: Towards moving beyond bias and
representation." 2021)//NT

I. BLACKNESS AND THE HUMAN. [To ethically engage in a conversation
between AI and race]{.underline} (and thus Blackness) [requires moving
beyond racial representation, bias, and discrimination]{.underline}.
That is, it requires [an understanding of antiblackness as a structuring
principle for thought and action, which is enacted using concepts of
race]{.underline}. In other words, [antiblackness structures not just
outcomes]{.underline} (e.g., racial inequality, medical apartheid, and
more), [but structures practices of knowing, thinking, and
modeling.]{.underline} Just as inequality is a symptom of antiblackness,
so too, it can be argued, is much of the AI design (e.g., many of the
systems that have been developed and deployed have enabled particularly
inequitable and anti-Black practices, \[2\]). The distinction between
[human intelligence and artificial intelligence is enabled by a belief
in an onto-epistemological structure that positions Blackness as the
negation of the Human or at the very least the infrahuman, as the index
against which the Human is measured and constructed/designed.
Blackness]{.underline}, in this sense, [is the name given to the
antagonism of the Human world, that which helps its material
configuration and articulation]{.underline}. This configuration and
articulation is key to how we define human intelligence and, thus, how
we define artificial intelligence that is synthesized \[5\] by the
Human. Thus, [to explore the entanglement of Blackness within AI is to
understand the Blackness beyond identity and category and understand it
as follows. 1) A sign, symbol, or metaphor that represents something,
namely, lack and dereliction]{.underline} \[8\]. 2) **[As a paradigmatic
expression of the world. Put differently, the Human is predicated on a
regime of the social organization that excludes Blackness. AI is
configured along the political ontology of race in that it relies on the
entwined nature of the Human and nonhuman (or Other).]{.underline}**
Blackness reinscribes the Human as synonymous with western Man. [The
Human marks the agentic properties for all AI designs, not Blackness.
Human intelligence is reliant on the dominant, standard genre of the
Human]{.underline} \[9\] [that positions the "Western bourgeoise liberal
monohumanist" as the Human.]{.underline} This [requires the "wholly
Other" status of those of African descent, that is Blackness, as well as
the descriptive codes]{.underline} or memes [that specify]{.underline}
the "[symbolic life/death]{.underline}" of homo oeconomicus \[9, p.
29\]. To draw the line between human intelligence and artificial
intelligence, there must be an account for naturally human and
artificial. That natural definition of the Human is reliant on our
present sociogenic "Darwinian descriptive statement" \[9, p. 29\] that
informs and undergirds what it means to be a natural human and by
consequence what it means to be artificial, or, according to Simon \[5,
p. 5\], "synthesized. . . by human beings" and "imitate appearances in
natural things while lacking the reality of the latter" (emphasis ours).
Indeed, even the use of intelligence as a conceptual marker brings with
it a certain "value-laden" history \[10\]. [The typical account for
intelligence is reliant on historically eugenic science that used the
racial hierarchy as a structuring principle. Thus, to think and act
ethically about Blackness]{.underline} (and by extension, race) [and AI,
we must recognize the degree to which the political ontology of
Blackness affects and structures the world; that is, we must take into
consideration the innocuousness ascribed to the Human.]{.underline} III.
STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS, ANTIBLACKNESS, AND AI. While many continue to focus
on individuals and specific acts or bias toward anti-Black, racist
outcomes (e.g., concepts related to implicit bias, \[11\]--\[13\], and
individual acts of dehumanization \[14\]), this individual focus
obscures a structural cause that historically has had a longer lasting
and more pervasive impact \[15\], \[16\]. [Structural racism, enacted
through policies at social institutions above the level of the
individual, acts as the environment in which AI systems are designed,
developed, and deployed. Structural racism is also enacted through the
sociocultural knowledge and systems created as a result of institutional
policies]{.underline} (some of which might be considered more formal
dogma, while other knowledge may take the less formal or more relaxed
form of doxa \[17\]). [These structural forms of racism result in
anti-Black outcomes: they result in disparities in healthcare
treatment]{.underline} \[18\], [the assignment of
criminality]{.underline} \[19\], \[20\], the continued segregation of
resources \[21\], \[22\], and a plethora of other anti-Black outcomes
(e.g., \[23\]--\[25\]). [These outcomes further result in modification
of knowledge systems that also inform structural policies, creating a
pernicious cycle of implicit and explicit antiblackness.]{.underline}
Noble \[24\] audits and observes the ways in which the Google search
engine treats Blackness and women, particularly focusing on the
intersection thereof. She notes that "search engine results perpetuate
particular narratives that reflect historically uneven distributions of
power in society" (\[24, p. 71\]). Noble uses Google because it is a
"broker of cultural imperialism" (\[24, p. 86\]). She uses the
"pornification" of Black women and girls within the Google search engine
to shed light on the commodified nature of the seemingly neutral results
returned. Search engine results here are not neutral, but instead a
reproduction of sociocultural knowledge for the purposes of advertising
as well as the collection of more "behavioral surplus" data \[26\], like
personalized clickthrough data (e.g., \[27\]), all factors used to learn
which results to return over-time. The example of audited Google search
results is a particularly useful example when thinking about the
modification of knowledge systems as one considers the growth of Google
(and similar search engines) as an ever-growing important arbiter of
knowledge. Sparrow et al. \[28\] discussed the effects of having
information available via systems like Internet search engines on
transactive memory (which can be thought of as a "combination of memory
stores held directly by individuals and the memory stores they can
access because they know someone who knows that information" \[28\]).
They found that knowing that such information is available via a
computational system like a search engine reduced the likelihood of (an
individual) storing specific information about that item to memory and
instead resulted in storing information on where to find that item in
memory. Sparrow et al. \[28\] contend that we have become dependent on
these systems in the same way that "we are dependent on all the
knowledge we gain from our friends and coworkers---and lose if they are
out of touch." Thus, those [AI systems sort and decide knowledge to give
us is important given that these systems pull information from
structurally anti-Black environments and because we treat the
information retrieved in a manner similar to the ways we have treated
knowledge from some friends and family in the past]{.underline}---they
create a bootstrapping process that reflects existing anti-Black
structures and enacts cycles of those structures through the decisions
made. The pervasive use of large amounts of data to inform AI systems
has resulted in a more recent push toward examining the ways one might
change those AI systems or those data for less biased (which often
includes some form of racial bias) outcomes in the use of those systems
or data or both \[1\], \[7\], \[29\]--\[31\]. Despite general forms of
bias reduction in systems, dehumanization of Blackness persists. To show
an example of this persistence despite measures of bias reduction, we
examine the ConceptNet semantic knowledge network.

...

IV\. BLACKNESS IN AI ETHICS. [Any attempt to ethically explore the
entanglement between AI and antiblackness requires that we attend to the
paradigmatic and structural, while acknowledging the agentic power of
individuals in developing artifacts that perpetuate and fortify this
structure.]{.underline} Acknowledging the anti-Black structure of the
Human as the ethical problem is important to any and all discussions
about bias, race, and antiblackness in AI systems. This is to say [that
ethics and the applications thereof for AI systems presupposes
"relations of recognition" of humanity and subjectivity---something that
the "spectre of slavery destroys]{.underline}" \[42, p. 54\]; and as we
discuss in a following paragraph, current codes of ethics, ethical
guidelines, etc., are lacking in their attempts to explicitly address
the issue of antiblackness in AI systems. To move beyond projects in AI
ethics that force a certain assimilation and colonization (Benjamin
\[23, p. 176\] provided a related discussion on design as a colonizing
project), antiblackness and the foundations of this continuously
maintained boundary \[25\] must be directly addressed. Despite this
importance, AI ethics principles and frameworks continue to leave out
antiblackness as paradigmatic, regardless of increasing awareness of
bias and racism writ large. The previously mentioned de-biasing for the
Conceptnet Numberbatch is a useful example of the issues one can
encounter when not more directly considering antiblackness. Our audit of
that system for semantic relatedness between the racialized terms of
black_man, white_man, black_woman, white_man (as well as standardized
representations of man and woman) showed a pattern reflective of known
historical relations between human-related representations,
animal-related representations, and existing racial structures
(portraying a social order or hierarchy). Those data showed that despite
the aforementioned de-biasing of the ConceptNet Numberbatch system,
black_man retained a closer semantic relatedness to animalistic terms,
while white_man retained a closer semantic relatedness to terms that
portray humanity. What is more, the lack of semantic representation for
black_woman (while white_woman remained a stand-in for woman) shows the
continued issue of intersectionality \[34\], that is the issue of
racialized, gendered intersections. The erasure of black_woman in a
system that has been "de-biased" is notable. In the same way that
Saucier \[42, p. 56\] argues that those in ethnography believe
(incorrectly) that "they can attend to social life in the midst of urban
decay, the militarization of schools, police brutality,\... and the like
without coming to terms with the political ontology of blackness," so to
do AI ethics discussions, principles, and frameworks skip over
addressing Blackness and antiblackness directly. Indeed, this issue of
not tackling antiblackness head-on when considering AI bias and ethics
can be seen in the general literature. For example, Jobin et al. \[35\]
gave a picture of the "global landscape" of AI ethics guidelines and
principles references in the "justice, fairness, and equity" section of
that review, none of those references reference antiblackness (0) and
only 14% of those references (9) even provide some discussion on racism
or racist policy (and this is with a fairly low bar of providing some
discussion or example of race/racism beyond listing the term race
alongside other categories that are the result of forms of structural
oppression, like gender or ethnicity.) General frameworks that call for
the development of systems to mitigate bias (e.g., \[36\]), or general
mapping of ethics debates (e.g., \[37\]) will continue to fail to
adequately address systems of oppression without more directly and
explicitly focusing on these systems.

#### Ethical AI discourse is a façade -- only serves to stall tech regulations

**OCHIGAME 19** - Rodrigo Ochigame - PhD candidate in science,
technology, and society at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
and a former researcher of artificial intelligence at the MIT Media Lab,
12-20-2019, \"How Big Tech Manipulates Academia to Avoid Regulation,\"
Intercept,
https://theintercept.com/2019/12/20/mit-ethical-ai-artificial-intelligence///vi

THE IRONY OF the ethical scandal enveloping Joichi Ito, the former
director of the MIT Media Lab, is that he used to lead academic
initiatives on ethics. After the revelation of his financial ties to
Jeffrey Epstein, the financier charged with sex trafficking underage
girls as young as 14, Ito resigned from multiple roles at MIT, a
visiting professorship at Harvard Law School, and the boards of the John
D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the John S. and James L.
Knight Foundation, and the New York Times Company. Many spectators are
puzzled by Ito's influential role as an ethicist of artificial
intelligence. Indeed, his initiatives were crucial in establishing the
[discourse of "ethical AI" that is now ubiquitous in academia and in the
mainstream press. In 2016]{.underline}, then-President Barack Obama
described him as an "expert" on AI and ethics. Since 2017, Ito financed
many projects through the \$27 million Ethics and Governance of AI Fund,
an initiative anchored by the MIT Media Lab and the Berkman Klein Center
for Internet and Society at Harvard University. What was all the talk of
"ethics" really about? For 14 months, I worked as a graduate student
researcher in Ito's group on AI ethics at the Media Lab. I stopped on
August 15, immediately after Ito published his initial "apology"
regarding his ties to Epstein, in which he acknowledged accepting money
from the financier both for the Media Lab and for Ito's outside venture
funds. Ito did not disclose that Epstein had, at the time this money
changed hands, already pleaded guilty to a child prostitution charge in
Florida, or that Ito took numerous steps to hide Epstein's name from
official records, as The New Yorker later revealed. The discourse of
"ethical AI" was aligned strategically with a Silicon Valley effort
seeking to avoid legally enforceable restrictions of controversial
technologies. Inspired by whistleblower Signe Swenson and others who
have spoken out, I have decided to report what I came to learn regarding
Ito's role in shaping the field of AI ethics, since this is a matter of
public concern. The [emergence of this field is a recent phenomenon, as
past AI researchers had been largely uninterested in the study of
ethics.]{.underline} A former Media Lab colleague recalls that Marvin
Minsky, the deceased AI pioneer at MIT, used to say that "an ethicist is
someone who has a problem with whatever you have in your mind." (In
recently unsealed court filings, victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre
testified that Epstein directed her to have sex with Minsky.) Why, then,
did AI researchers suddenly start talking about ethics? At the Media
Lab, I learned [that the discourse of "ethical AI," championed
substantially by Ito, was aligned strategically with a **Silicon
Valley** effort seeking **to avoid legally enforceable restrictions of
controversial tech**nologies]{.underline}. A key group behind this
effort, with the lab as a member, made policy recommendations in
California that contradicted the conclusions of research I conducted
with several lab colleagues, research that led us to oppose the use of
computer algorithms in deciding whether to jail people pending trial.
Ito himself would eventually complain, in private meetings with
financial and tech executives, that the group's recommendations amounted
to "whitewashing" a thorny ethical issue. "They water down stuff we try
to say to prevent the use of algorithms that don't seem to work well" in
detention decisions, he confided to one billionaire. I also watched MIT
help the U.S. military brush aside the moral complexities of drone
warfare, hosting a superficial talk on AI and ethics by Henry Kissinger,
[the former secretary of state and notorious war criminal, and giving
input on the U.S. Department of Defense's "AI Ethics Principles" for
warfare, which embraced "permissibly biased" algorithms and which
avoided using the word "fairness" because the Pentagon believes "that
**fights should not be fair."**]{.underline} Ito did not respond to
requests for comment. Joichi Ito, director of MIT Media Lab, speaks
during a press conference in Tokyo, Japan, on Friday, July 8, 2016.

CREDIBILITY to the idea that big tech could police its own use of
artificial intelligence at a time when the industry faced increasing
criticism and calls for legal regulation. Just in 2018, there were
several controversies: Facebook's breach of private data on more than 50
million users to a political marketing firm hired by Donald Trump's
presidential campaign, revealed in March 2018; Google's contract with
the Pentagon for computer vision software to be used in combat zones,
revealed that same month; Amazon's sale of facial recognition technology
to police departments, revealed in May; Microsoft's contract with the
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement revealed in June; and IBM's
secret collaboration with the New York Police Department for facial
recognition and racial classification in video surveillance footage,
revealed in September. [Under the slogan #TechWontBuildIt, thousands of
workers at these firms have organized protests and circulated petitions
against such contracts. From #NoTechForICE to #Data4BlackLives, several
grassroots campaigns have demanded legal restrictions of some uses of
computational technologies (e.g., forbidding the use of facial
recognition by police). Meanwhile, corporations have tried to shift the
discussion to focus on voluntary "ethical principles," "responsible
practices," and technical adjustments or "safeguards" framed in terms of
"bias" and "fairness" (e.g., requiring or encouraging police to adopt
"unbiased" or "fair" facial recognition). In January 2018, Microsoft
published its "ethical principles" for AI, starting with "fairness." In
May, Facebook announced its "commitment to the ethical development and
deployment of AI" and a tool to "search for bias" called "Fairness
Flow." In June, Google published its "responsible practices" for AI
research and development. In September, IBM announced a tool called "AI
Fairness 360," designed to "check for unwanted bias in datasets and
machine learning models." In January 2019, Facebook granted \$7.5
million for the creation of an AI ethics center in Munich, Germany. In
March, Amazon co-sponsored a \$20 million program on "fairness in AI"
with the U.S. National Science Foundation. In April, Google canceled its
AI ethics council after backlash over the selection of Kay Coles James,
the vocally anti-trans president of the right-wing Heritage
Foundation.]{.underline} These corporate initiatives frequently cited
academic research that Ito had supported, at least partially, through
the MIT-Harvard fund. To characterize the corporate agenda, [it is
helpful to distinguish between three kinds of regulatory possibilities
for a given technology: (**1) no legal regulation** at all, leaving
"ethical principles" and "responsible practices" as merely voluntary;
(2) moderate legal regulation encouraging or requiring technical
adjustments that do not conflict significantly with profits; **or (3)
restrictive legal regulation** curbing or **banning deployment of the
technology. Unsurprisingly, the tech industry** tends to support the
first two and **oppose the last**. The corporate-sponsored discourse of
"ethical AI" **enables precisely this position.** Consider the case of
facial recognition]{.underline}. This year, the municipal legislatures
of San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley --- all in California --- plus
Somerville, Massachusetts, have passed strict bans on facial recognition
technology. Meanwhile, [Microsoft has lobbied in favor of less
restrictive legislation, requiring technical adjustments such as tests
for "bias," most notably in Washington state. Some big firms may even
prefer this kind of mild legal regulation over a complete lack thereof,
since larger firms can more easily invest in specialized teams to
develop systems that comply with regulatory requirements.]{.underline}
Thus, [Silicon Valley's vigorous promotion of "ethical AI" has
constituted a strategic lobbying effort, one that has **enrolled
academia to legitimize itself**.]{.underline} Ito played a key role in
this corporate-academic fraternizing, meeting regularly with tech
executives. The MIT-Harvard fund's initial director was the former
"global public policy lead" for AI at Google. Through the fund, Ito and
his associates sponsored many projects, including the creation of a
prominent conference on "Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency" in
computer science; other sponsors of the conference included Google,
Facebook, and Microsoft. Although the Silicon Valley lobbying effort has
consolidated academic interest in "ethical AI" and "fair algorithms"
since 2016, a handful of papers on these topics had appeared in earlier
years, even if framed differently. For example, Microsoft computer
scientists published the paper that arguably inaugurated the field of
"algorithmic fairness" in 2012. In 2016, the paper's lead author,
Cynthia Dwork, became a professor of computer science at Harvard, with
simultaneous positions at its law school and at Microsoft. When I took
her Harvard course on the mathematical foundations of cryptography and
statistics in 2017, I interviewed her and asked how she became
interested in researching algorithmic definitions of fairness. In her
account, she had long been personally concerned with the issue of
discriminatory advertising, but Microsoft managers encouraged her to
pursue this line of work because the firm was developing a new system of
online advertising, and it would be economically advantageous to provide
a service "free of regulatory problems." (To be fair, I believe that
Dwork's personal intentions were honest despite the corporate capture of
her ideas. Microsoft declined to comment for this article.) After the
initial steps by MIT and Harvard, many other universities and new
institutes received money from the tech industry to work on AI ethics.
Most such organizations are also headed by current or former executives
of tech firms. For example, the Data & Society Research Institute is
directed by a Microsoft researcher and initially funded by a Microsoft
grant; New York University's AI Now Institute was co-founded by another
Microsoft researcher and partially funded by Microsoft, Google, and
DeepMind; the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI is co-directed by
a former vice president of Google; University of California, Berkeley's
Division of Data Sciences is headed by a Microsoft veteran; and the MIT
Schwarzman College of Computing is headed by a board member of Amazon.
During my time at the Media Lab, Ito maintained frequent contact with
the executives and planners of all these organizations.
Comp-7-for-spot-2-1576795206Illustration: Yoshi Sodeoka for The
Intercept BIG TECH MONEY and direction proved incompatible with an
honest exploration of ethics, at least judging from my experience with
the "Partnership on AI to Benefit People and Society," a group founded
by Microsoft, Google/DeepMind, Facebook, IBM, and Amazon in 2016. PAI,
of which the Media Lab is a member, defines itself as a
"multistakeholder body" and claims it is "not a lobbying organization."
In an April 2018 hearing at the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and
Government Reform, the Partnership's executive director claimed that the
organization is merely "a resource to policymakers --- for instance, [in
conducting research that informs AI best practices and exploring the
societal consequences of certain AI systems, as well as policies around
the development and use of AI systems." But even if the Partnership's
activities may not meet the legal threshold requiring registration as
lobbyists --- for example, by seeking to directly affect the votes of
individual elected officials --- the partnership has certainly sought to
influence legislation.]{.underline} For example, in November 2018, the
Partnership staff asked academic members to contribute to a collective
statement to the Judicial Council of California regarding a Senate bill
on penal reform (S.B. 10). The bill, in the course of eliminating cash
bail, expanded the use of algorithmic risk assessment in pretrial
decision making, and required the Judicial Council to "address the
identification and mitigation of any implicit bias in assessment
instruments." The Partnership staff wrote, "we believe there is room to
impact this legislation (and CJS \[criminal justice system\]
applications more broadly)." In December 2018, three Media Lab
colleagues and I raised serious objections to the Partnership's efforts
to influence legislation. We observed that the Partnership's policy
recommendations aligned consistently with the corporate agenda. In the
penal case, our research led us to strongly oppose the adoption of risk
assessment tools, and to reject the proposed technical adjustments that
would supposedly render them "unbiased" or "fair." But the Partnership's
draft statement seemed, as a colleague put it in an internal email to
Ito and others, to "validate the use of RA \[risk assessment\] by
emphasizing the issue as a technical one that can therefore be solved
with better data sets, etc." A second colleague agreed that the "PAI
statement is weak and risks doing exactly what we've been warning
against re: the risk of legitimation via these industry led regulatory
efforts." A third colleague wrote, "So far as the criminal justice work
is concerned, what PAI is doing in this realm is quite alarming and also
in my opinion seriously misguided. I agree with Rodrigo that PAI's
association with ACLU, MIT and other academic / non-profit institutions
practically ends up serving a legitimating function. Neither ACLU nor
MIT nor any non-profit has any power in PAI." Worse, there seemed to be
a mismatch between the Partnership's recommendations and the efforts of
a grassroots coalition of organizations fighting jail expansion,
including the movement Black Lives Matter, the prison abolitionist group
Critical Resistance (where I have volunteered), and the undocumented and
queer/trans youth-led Immigrant Youth Coalition. The grassroots
coalition argued, "The notion that any risk assessment instrument can
account for bias ignores the racial disparities in current and past
policing practices." There are abundant theoretical and empirical
reasons to support this claim, since risk assessments are typically
based on data of arrests, convictions, or incarcerations, all of which
are poor proxies for individual behaviors or predispositions. The
coalition continued, "Ultimately, risk-assessment tools create a
feedback-loop of racial profiling, pre-trial detention and conviction. A
person's freedom should not be reduced to an algorithm." By contrast,
the Partnership's statement focused on "minimum requirements for
responsible deployment," spanning such topics as "validity and data
sampling bias, bias in statistical predictions; choice of the
appropriate targets for prediction; human-computer interaction
questions; user training; policy and governance; transparency and
review; reproducibility, process, and recordkeeping; and post-deployment
evaluation." To be sure, the Partnership staff did respond to criticism
of the draft by noting in the final version of the statement that
"within PAI's membership and the wider AI community, many experts
further suggest that individuals can never justly be detained on the
basis of their risk assessment score alone, without an individualized
hearing." This meek concession --- admitting that it might not be time
to start imprisoning people based strictly on software, without input
from a judge or any other "individualized" judicial process --- was
easier to make because none of the major firms in the Partnership sell
risk assessment tools for pretrial decision-making; not only is the
technology too controversial but also the market is too small. (Facial
recognition technology, on the other hand, has a much larger market in
which Microsoft, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Amazon all operate.) In
December 2018, my colleagues and I urged Ito to quit the Partnership. I
argued, "If academic and nonprofit organizations want to make a
difference, the only viable strategy is to quit PAI, make a public
statement, and form a counter alliance." Then a colleague proposed,
"there are many other organizations which are doing much more
substantial and transformative work in this area of predictive analytics
in criminal justice --- what would it look like to take the money we
currently allocate in supporting PAI in order to support their work?" We
believed Ito had enough autonomy to do so because the MIT-Harvard fund
was supported largely by the Knight Foundation, even though most of the
money came from tech investors Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, via the
Omidyar Network, and Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn and Microsoft
board member. I wrote, "If tens of millions of dollars from nonprofit
foundations and individual donors are not enough to allow us to take a
bold position and join the right side, I don't know what would be."
(Omidyar funds The Intercept.) It is strange that Ito, with no formal
training, became positioned as an "expert" on AI ethics, a field that
barely existed before 2017. Ito did acknowledge the problem. He had just
received a message from David M. Siegel, co-chair of the hedge fund Two
Sigma and member of the MIT Corporation. Siegel proposed a
self-regulatory structure for "search and social media" firms in Silicon
Valley, modeled after the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or
FINRA, a private corporation that serves as a self-regulatory
organization for securities firms on Wall Street. Ito responded to
Siegel's proposal, "I don't feel civil society is well represented in
the industry groups. We've been participating in Partnership in AI and
they water down stuff we try to say to prevent the use of algorithms
that don't seem to work well like risk scores for pre-trial bail. I
think that with personal data and social media, I have concerns with
self-regulation. For example, a full blown genocide \[of the Rohingya, a
mostly Muslim minority group in Myanmar\] happened using What's App and
Facebook knew it was happening." (Facebook has admitted that its
platform was used to incite violence in Myanmar; news reports have
documented how content on the Facebook platform facilitated a genocide
in the country despite repeated warnings to Facebook executives from
human rights activists and researchers. Facebook texting service
WhatsApp made it harder for its users to forward messages after WhatsApp
was reportedly used to spread misinformation during elections in India.)
But the corporate-academic alliances were too robust and convenient. The
Media Lab remained in the Partnership, and Ito continued to fraternize
with Silicon Valley and Wall Street executives and investors. Ito
described Siegel, a billionaire, as a "potential funder." With such
people, I saw Ito routinely express moral concerns about their
businesses --- but in a friendly manner, as he was simultaneously asking
them for money, whether for MIT or his own venture capital funds. For
corporate-academic "ethicists," amicable criticism can serve as leverage
for entering into business relationships. Siegel replied to Ito, "I
would be pleased to speak more on this topic with you. Finra is not an
industry group. It's just paid for by industry. I will explain more when
we meet. I agree with your concerns." In private meetings, Ito and tech
executives discussed the corporate lobby quite frankly. In January, my
colleagues and I joined a meeting with Mustafa Suleyman, founding
co-chair of the Partnership and co-founder of DeepMind, an AI startup
acquired by Google for about \$500 million in 2014. In the meeting, Ito
and Suleyman discussed how the promotion of "AI ethics" had become a
"whitewashing" effort, although they claimed their initial intentions
had been nobler. In a message to plan the meeting, Ito wrote to my
colleagues and me, "I do know, however, from speaking to Mustafa when he
was setting up PAI that he was meaning for the group to be much more
substantive and not just 'white washing.' I think it's just taking the
trajectory that these things take." (Suleyman did not respond to
requests for comment.) REGARDLESS OF INDIVIDUAL actors' intentions, the
[corporate lobby's effort to shape academic research was extremely
successful. There is now an enormous amount of work under the rubric of
"AI ethics." To be fair, some of the research is useful and nuanced,
especially in the humanities and social sciences. But the majority of
well-funded work on "ethical AI" is aligned with the tech lobby's
agenda: to voluntarily or moderately adjust, rather than legally
restrict, the deployment of controversial technologies. How did five
corporations, using only a small fraction of their budgets, manage to
influence and frame so much academic activity, in so many disciplines,
so quickly?]{.underline} It is strange that Ito, [with no formal
training, became positioned as an "expert" on AI ethics, a field that
barely existed before 2017. But it is even stranger that two years
later, respected scholars in established disciplines have to demonstrate
their relevance to a field conjured by a corporate lobby.]{.underline}

Clark/CQ Roll Call/Getty Images The field has also become relevant to
the U.S. military, not only in official responses to moral concerns
about technologies of targeted killing but also in disputes among
Silicon Valley firms over lucrative military contracts. On November 1,
the Department of Defense's innovation board published its
recommendations for "AI Ethics Principles." The board is chaired by Eric
Schmidt, who was the executive chair of Alphabet, Google's parent
company, when Obama's defense secretary Ashton B. Carter established the
board and appointed him in 2016. According to ProPublica, "Schmidt's
influence, already strong under Carter, only grew when \[James\] Mattis
arrived as \[Trump's\] defense secretary." The board includes multiple
executives from Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, raising controversies
regarding conflicts of interest. A Pentagon employee responsible for
policing conflicts of interest was removed from the innovation board
after she challenged "the Pentagon's cozy relationship not only with
\[Amazon CEO Jeff\] Bezos, but with Google's Eric Schmidt." This
relationship is potentially lucrative for big tech firms: The AI ethics
recommendations appeared less than a week after the Pentagon awarded a
\$10 billion cloud-computing contract to Microsoft, which is being
legally challenged by Amazon[. The majority of well-funded work on
"ethical AI" is aligned with the **tech** lobby's agenda: to voluntarily
or moderately adjust, rather than legally restrict, the deployment of
controversial technologies. The recommendations seek to compel the
Pentagon to increase military investments in AI and to adopt "ethical
AI" systems such as those developed and sold by Silicon Valley
firms.]{.underline} The innovation board calls the Pentagon a "deeply
ethical organization" and offers to extend its "existing ethics
framework" to AI. To this end, the board cites the AI ethics research
groups at Google, Microsoft, and IBM, as well as academics sponsored by
the MIT-Harvard fund. However, there are caveats. For example, the board
notes that although "the term 'fairness' is often cited in the AI
community," the recommendations avoid this term because of "the DoD
mantra that fights should not be fair, as DoD aims to create the
conditions to maintain an unfair advantage over any potential
adversaries." Thus, "some applications will be permissibly and
justifiably biased," specifically "to target certain adversarial
combatants more successfully[." The **Pentagon's conception of AI ethics
forecloses many important possibilities for moral deliberation**, such
as the prohibition of drones for targeted killing. The corporate,
academic, and military proponents of "ethical AI" have collaborated
closely for mutual benefit]{.underline}. For example, Ito told me that
he informally advised Schmidt on which academic AI ethicists Schmidt's
private foundation should fund. Once, Ito even asked me for second-order
advice on whether Schmidt should fund a certain professor who, like Ito,
later served as an "expert consultant" to the Pentagon's innovation
board. In February, Ito joined Carter at a panel titled "Computing for
the People: Ethics and AI," which also included current and former
executives of Microsoft and Google. The panel was part of the inaugural
celebration of MIT's \$1 billion college dedicated to AI. Other speakers
at the celebration included Schmidt on "Computing for the Marketplace,"
Siegel on "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Algorithms," and
Henry Kissinger on "How the Enlightenment Ends." As Kissinger declared
the possibility of "a world relying on machines powered by data and
algorithms and ungoverned by ethical or philosophical norms," a protest
outside the MIT auditorium called attention to Kissinger's war crimes in
Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, as well as his support of war crimes
elsewhere. In the age of automated targeting, what atrocities will the
U.S. military justify as governed by "ethical" norms or as executed by
machines beyond the scope of human agency and culpability? No defensible
claim to "ethics" can sidestep the urgency of legally enforceable
restrictions to the deployment of technologies of mass surveillance and
systemic violence[. Until such restrictions exist, moral and political
deliberation about computing will remain subsidiary to the profit-making
imperative expressed by the Media Lab's motto, **"Deploy or Die."**
While some deploy, even if ostensibly "ethically," others
die.]{.underline}

THE SHIFTING NEBULOSITY OF WHITENESS The racial imagery we have
encountered in AI discourse tends to be unstable. The rhetoric used by
Feigenbaum and McCorduck in the early 1980s to describe a feminized and
racialized Japanese "enemy," for instance, would be less palatable
today. And Feigenbaum's declaration to the U.S. Congress that his nation
must lead the world in AI, for it is the "manifest destiny of
computing," probably would not be the choice phrase for contemporary
experts.15 Likewise, Herbert Simon and Allen Newell's early 1970s
hierarchical depiction of "culture"--- where "student" is placed above
"worker" and "hippie," and where U.S. culture sits above that of the
"French" and "Chinese"--- would at best seem out of touch.16 This type
of **[change is characteristic of the racial sciences, whose offerings
have always been a moving target.]{.underline}** As Nell Irvin Painter
has observed, theorists of race such as Johann F. Blumenbach had to
"walk a tightrope of contradictions" as they produced incoherent
accounts of racial difference.17 And the theories rapidly changed.
Blumenbach's late eighteenth- century definition of the "five races" is
long expired, for example, as is the account of the "eight races"
embraced by W. E. B. Du Bois in the nineteenth century.18 By now,
[attempts to ground race using anthropometrics are similarly out of
fashion in mainstream science.]{.underline}19 **[The instability of the
racial sciences demonstrates the shaky epistemic footing of theories of
racial difference. But the instability also shows how nebulous whiteness
is in that it can draw on the changing and contradictory fruits of the
racial sciences.]{.underline}** And the racial sciences are merely one
component of the "makeshift patchwork" (as Cedric Robinson termed it)
that is used to perpetuate white supremacy in response to new challenges
and social conditions.20 American history offers many glimpses into the
makeshift patchwork, and with it, the nebulous character of whiteness.
[The Naturalization Law of 1790 admitted only "free white" persons into
the colonies, but such unspecified whiteness had to be revised after the
large influx of Irish and Eastern European migrants--- who were
considered a "lesser" shade of white than the English
colonists.]{.underline} This eventually led to what Matthew Frye
Jacobson has called [**"the fracturing of whiteness": a condition where
"whiteness itself would become newly problematic and, in some quarters,
lose its monolithic character."**21 Americans of Japanese origin who
sought citizenship on grounds of being "white" were rejected for not
being "Caucasian"; migrants from India who claimed citizenship because
they were deemed "Caucasian" by anthropologists were rejected for not
being "white." The appearance of Arab migrants, too, threw a wrench in
attempts to ground whiteness.]{.underline}22 **[Changing social and
economic conditions meant that the instruments and logics that
determined whiteness also had to change. To grasp whiteness, then, is
not a matter of looking for its essence in any particular theory of
race, but rather seeing how its ideological flexibility works to serve
political interests.]{.underline}** In the latter part of the
seventeenth century the colony of Virginia's slave codes repeatedly
redefined whiteness using a calculus of capitalist and imperial
interests. As more Africans were kidnapped into slavery and the supply
of European indentured labor decreased, these codes helped to sustain
the system of African slave labor.23 [For example, these laws instated
that blacks who convert to Christianity would remain enslaved--- a
deviation from English law at the time, which forbade enslavement of
Christians. There were other peculiar deviations from English law.24 By
English convention, citizenship passed through the father, yet Virginia
adopted a rule where children born to enslaved women remain in bondage.
As the notion of American whiteness congealed, such rules implicitly
answered the question of whether mixed children could be "white," but
did so in a way that helped slaveholders expand their labor force by
exploiting black women's reproductive labor (and while sanctioning the
rape of enslaved women by white men).]{.underline} Yet these dictates of
whiteness were inconsistent, as they often are, across race and gender
lines: white women, by comparison, faced fines and potential jail time
for giving birth to a "mulatto" child. A variety of relations between
whites and blacks were similarly punished by law, partly to repress
cross- racial rebellions.25 In settler- colonialist societies,
additional considerations go into the contradictory making of whiteness.
[While the onedrop- of- blood rule made one "black" in the eyes of the
law--- as conducive to maintaining the supply of unfree labor--- Native
Americans often had to meet a more stringent criterion based on "blood
quantum" in order to count as "Indian" for the U.S.
government]{.underline}.26 This did not mean, of course, that Native
Americans became fully "white" with respect to privilege and social
standing, but rather that the settler- colonialist impulse to erase
indigenous peoples, or violently assimilate them into white society, was
the prevailing consideration--- and that this was a distinct logic from
that applied to enslaved Africans.27 These are some of the contingencies
and contradictions that go into the making of whiteness. As Charles
Mills has observed, racial categories are thus simultaneously "unreal,"
in that they lack the solid grounding in phenotypic features such as
light skin, and "real," in that racial categories have "a massive effect
on people's psychology, culture, socioeconomic opportunities, life
chances, civil rights."28 The all too real consequences of whiteness
come from its connection to concrete systems of power. From colonial
America to the present, whiteness has been intertwined with capitalist
conceptions of property inscribed into law. One's whiteness functions as
property in American law, as Cheryl Harris has argued.29 [Harris's
breathtaking explication of whiteness as property begins with the
phenomenon of blacks "passing" as whites]{.underline}. She recounts the
story of her own grandmother, who, owing to a combination of phenotype
and circumstance, could "pass" as white in her workplace in Chicago in
the 1930s. At the time, this gained Harris's grandmother access to an
economic opportunity (though at incalculable psychological cost) denied
to women perceived as black. Passing shows the artificiality of
whiteness. Yet it also demonstrates the tangible rewards conferred by
being seen as "white," which historically include the right to vote, own
property, work, and choose where to live and whom to marry. There are
also less tangible, though still protected by law, elements to
whiteness. [These include the expectation of certain futures and the
right to one's reputation as a white person: in court rulings from as
late as the 1950s, calling a "white" person "black" was considered
defamation; the reverse clearly not.]{.underline}30 By protecting these
rights and expectations, American law has reinstated whites' "property
interest" in whiteness--- an interest predicated on the right to exclude
others.31 How American law deals with whiteness has changed in response
to popular struggle, but as Harris notes, "property interest in
whiteness has proven to be resilient and adaptive to new conditions[."
Calls for affirmative action, for example, have challenged the notion
that societies built on white supremacy can be made just by simply
removing the most overt forms of discrimination. These efforts were
contested in court by whites who saw affirmative action as "reverse
discrimination." As Harris has argued, by siding with white plaintiffs
and rejecting affirmative action in key instances, the courts have
effectively defended white privilege.]{.underline} For instance, in
admission to graduate schools, courts have defended the expectation of
whites to be privileged over nonwhites by identifying certain criteria
of "merit," such as standardized test scores, as neutral while ignoring
alternatives.32 [These moves cement the notion that the law must protect
the expectation of whites, as a group, to dominate educational
institutions.]{.underline} White supremacy can therefore be defended by
adopting more abstract, ostensibly nonracialized, criteria of "merit."
Indeed, while the right to exclude persists in all of forms of white
supremacy--- from colonial America to affirmative action cases in the
1970s--- the manifestations of this right and its justifications have
changed. As many have recognized, then, **[whiteness as an ideology
cannot be stably grounded in any specific racial account because
whiteness is empty]{.underline}**. "Whiteness, alone," Toni Morrison
wrote, "**[is mute, meaningless, unfathomable, pointless, frozen,
veiled, curtained, dreaded, senseless, implacable."33 Whiteness gets its
significance, and its changing shape, only from the need to maintain
relations of power]{.underline}**. **[AI reproduces this quality of
whiteness]{.underline}**. MIMICKING WHITENESS IN FORM We have seen how
**[AI is a tool that serves the dominant aims of white supremacy. In
that sense, it is not unlike financial and legal instruments, which are
also used to reinforce white supremacy. But there is more to the linkage
between AI and whiteness: AI can perform its service so well partly
because it mimics the structure of whiteness as an
ideology.]{.underline}** **[Like the ideology of whiteness, AI has been
a nebulous, moving target from its inception]{.underline}**. From the
moment the label "AI" was coined, its boundaries were unstable. What
counts as AI has repeatedly changed, as we have seen, and attempts to
ground AI in technical terms, along a set of epistemic considerations or
even scientific goals, could never keep this endeavor together. There
is, however, strong continuity to different iterations of "AI," but it
does not lie in the axes that cognitive scientists, philosophers, and AI
practitioners have typically focused on. Continuity arises, instead,
from the ways in which AI is situated and justified. As we saw in
chapter 1, **[AI was continually remade to be that which can serve
empire.]{.underline}** **[This resulted in narratives that recur across
different periods in striking detail.]{.underline}** Whether it was as
part of imperial competition with Japan in the 1980s or with China in
the 2010s, the "magical chip" narrative--- according to which the latest
hardware would enable AI's promised breakthrough--- has been steadily
rehearsed. Likewise, the use of AI as a pretext to advance capitalist
visions of society and thwart alternatives has been a fixture of AI
expert commentary (as we saw in chapter 2). In every iteration, we find
the practice of situating AI within capitalist and imperialist agendas.
AI's iterations did vary significantly in epistemic terms, and these
differences played into AI's political functions. Each iteration brought
distinct models of the self, which came with somewhat different
implications about what it means to know, as well as about the roles AI
practitioners would play in society. In the dominant narratives of the
1960s and 1970s, for example, the self was an agent in pursuit of
rational goals whose inner processing was captured by symbolic
representations (exemplified by Newell and Simon's work). Later, when
expert systems became the celebrated form of AI, the dominant epistemic
myths still revolved around human intelligence and knowledge as a form
of symbolic processing. Expert systems also came with a specific notion
of "expertise." Knowledge was to be elicited from "domain experts" by
yet another set of knowledge- encoding (or "knowledge representation")
experts, while AI practitioners were in charge of building the platforms
that knowledge- encoding experts use. AI practitioners were also
expected to "train" the knowledge- encoding experts; to help knowledge
encoders elicit knowledge from domain experts. In the late 1980s and
early 1990s, neural networks--- which weren't even considered "AI" by
early practitioners--- became AI's centerpieces and brought rather
different fictions about the self. The self of this period was a
radically empiricist machine. Since knowledge was now to be learned from
data, the knowledgeencoding experts of AI's prior iterations weren't
necessary. AI practitioners themselves also had a different role now.
Their primary task was no longer to design computing platforms for
encoding rich knowledge but rather to set the conditions for machines to
"learn" it from data in tabula rasa fashion (a framing that shares much
with neoliberal economic theory). At a technical level, their task was
largely to choose a computational architecture, decide what counts as
data, and train the architecture until it produced the behavior of
interest. In this framing, experts were merely creating the conditions
for a computational process that was supposedly independent of them---
and even surpassed human capacities. Although different in all these
ways, e**[very iteration of AI consistently brought models of the self
that were racialized, classed, and gendered, and predicated on the same
major epistemic forgeries]{.underline}** (like the aspiration to a "view
from nowhere," as we saw in chapter 3). The salient point, then, is that
while different epistemic tenets and computing systems were repackaged
as "AI" and others pushed out, the endeavor has rather stably served an
imperial and capitalist agenda (as with the ideology of whiteness). But
as with the ideology of whiteness, AI had to be adapted to new social
conditions and struggles against oppression. The rebranding of AI in the
2010s, as we saw, helped to divert attention from a confrontation with
mass surveillance and a backlash against Silicon Valley's neoliberal
visions of data- driven world governance. In this period, "AI" became a
new gloss for familiar computing systems and projects, such as building
platforms of behavior modification and control. Models of the self,
informed by these political projects, were being served: the self as a
connectionist machine, not unlike prior iterations of AI, but also an
explicitly behaviorist conception of "intelligence" as the product of
environmental rewards and punishments. The rebranded AI's experts, like
their predecessors in the 1980s, offered narratives about how AI would
enable a capitalist utopia and presented mastery of AI as crucial to
imperial hegemony. But the rebranded AI also gave rise to "critical AI
experts" that speak of social justice (which we will encounter again
later in this chapter). In this recent shift, AI continues to serve the
same agendas, but with a progressive veneer; an example of its
adaptability. **[As with the ideology of whiteness, this adaptability is
enabled by AI's plastic character and incoherence. Put differently, who
counts as "white" and how "nonwhites" stand in relation to "whites,"
historically, cannot be reduced to any given theory of the racial
sciences, let alone simple phenotypic features, since whiteness bends to
political and economic agendas that vary across contexts. Similarly,
what has counted as "AI" historically cannot be reduced to any technical
or epistemic account of computing systems divorced from the machinations
of empire and capital.]{.underline}** The latter mirrors the nebulous
character of the former, and in both cases the nebulosity is used to
advance the same tangible projects of empire and capital. **[This gives
AI the "unreal- yet- real" aspect that is characteristic of racial
categories.]{.underline}** AI is unreal because it is nebulous,
unstable, lacking in solid grounding, and continually redefined by
powerful interests in ways that seem arbitrary. Yet it is real in that
it is part of concrete, destructive practices. As we have seen, the
nebulous- sounding initiatives around AI in fact support global projects
of dispossession and land accumulation.

**The aff's invocation of "objective" globalized AI is rooted in the
technological project of white empire building that seeks to dominate
security discourse into racially insular spheres .**

THE WHITE VOICE OF AI EXPERTS The unreal character of AI has also made
it, like whiteness, prone to breakdowns--- occasions where the
incoherence surfaces. But in AI's case, these moments are often
exaggerated. As one commentator observed during the 1980s, "AI refuses
to die."34 **[AI persists, in part, because it captures the aspirations
of the still very white expert class that reconfigures it in the service
of empire and capital.]{.underline}** In the experts' professional
milieu, **[AI can be invoked with little to no explanation because it
shares the unstated premises of whiteness.]{.underline}** That AI is
nebulous to the point of emptiness is invisible, along with the premises
of whiteness generally, to those who are invested in it. Raymond
Lawrence ("Boots") Riley's film Sorry to Bother You (2018) brings out
some of these premises of whiteness and their intimate ties to
capitalism. The film's protagonist, Cassius ("Cash") Green, who is
black, finds work at a telemarketing center. An older black colleague
offers Cash some friendly advice: if you want to sell things over the
phone, use your "white voice." The colleague explains: "It's not about
sounding all nasal. It's about sounding like you don't have a care. Like
your bills are paid and you're happy about your future. . . . Breezy,
like you don't need this money, like you never been fired, only laid
off."35 The white voice, as the film brilliantly demonstrates, is a
politically useful fiction, not an imitation of any white person's
voice. As Cash's colleague says, "It's not what all White people sound
like--- there ain't no real White voice, but it's what they wish they
sounded like. It's what they think they're supposed to sound like." The
white voice merely stands for what whiteness as an ideology promises to
those who think they can climb up the ladder of privilege. Robin D. G.
Kelley notes that this voice rests on an expectation: "**[Like whiteness
itself, the white voice is a chimera, masking a specific class position
and conveying a sense of being genuinely worry free, with no bills to
pay, money in the bank, not a care in the world. This is the expectation
of whiteness--- an expectation many white people never, in fact,
realize."36 A white voice dominates the expert discourse on AI. This
voice tries to instill order by appealing to the expectation of
whiteness.]{.underline}** It instructs that the latest technology may be
harnessed either for "our" universal good or for ill, and thus "we" have
a rational choice to make about our future--- a potentially marvelous
future in which "our" problems are fixed by technical means through
consultation with the appropriate state, military, and corporate
"stakeholders." The white voice can be heard in statements such as
these: • "We have tried to promote an optimistic view of AI as an
activity with positive economic and social impacts even for low- budget
countries or groups."37 • "\[AI has\] extraordinary potential upsides,
from reducing worldwide energy consumption and addressing climate change
. . . we still have an opportunity to influence the design and use of
these tools for good."38 • "\[The\] AI- driven economy would not only
eliminate stress and drudgery and produce an abundance of everything we
want today, but it would also supply a bounty of wonderful new
products."39 • "AI can make our legal systems more fair and efficient if
we can figure out how to make robojudges transparent and unbiased. . . .
\[These could\] treat everyone equally, transparently applying the law
in truly unbiased fashion."40 • "\[AI\] is changing the world before our
eyes. Once the province of science fiction, we now carry systems powered
by AI in our pockets and wear them on our wrists. Vehicles on the market
can now drive themselves, diagnostic systems determine what is ailing
us, and risk assessment algorithms increasingly decide whether we are
jailed or set free after being charged with a crime."41 • "The promise
of AI to improve our lives is enormous. . . . Automated hiring systems
promise to evaluate job candidates on the basis of their bona fide
qualifications, rather than on qualities such as age or appearance that
often lead human decision- makers astray."42 • "AI will underpin our
future prosperity. . . . This is only the start; the potential of AI is
undeniable. . . . AI \[could\] free up time and raise productivity."43 •
"So what career advice should we give our kids? I'm encouraging mine to
go into professions that machines are currently bad at, and therefore
seem unlikely to get automated in the near future."44 • "AI may lift us
into a new kind of existence, where our humanity will be not only
preserved but also enhanced in ways we can hardly imagine."45 **[All
these commentaries suggest that "AI" can bring a wonderful future whose
direction everyone can shape, thus encapsulating the expectation of
whiteness and the reassuring quality of the white voice. The white voice
here also reveals the intended audience. It is mostly professional
elites who would accept the notion that the latest techno- product could
be put to "everyone's" future benefit by networked leaders from the
corporate, academic, and military- state worlds.]{.underline}** To
speculate on the management of these AI- based futures is to speak in
the white voice. There is real investment in the continued dominance of
the white voice. Through the web of partnerships and initiatives we
encountered in chapter 2, the commentators quoted are invested in the
idea of AI as a coherent and transformative force that they can manage
and interpret. Funds, media attention, university curricula, academic
publications, and policy reports all rest on this notion--- hence the
investment. **[The investment in AI can be seen as part of what George
Lipsitz has called the "possessive investment" in
whiteness.]{.underline}**46 **[Like Du Bois and Harris, Lipsitz noted
that there are tangible rewards to individuals who cling to their
whiteness, possessing it like property. Leaving "AI" unscrutinized as
commentators across the spectrum do pays off, and the white voice
continues to dominate. The white voice within AI, as in other
discourses, can be interrupted when whiteness itself is
challenged.]{.underline}** Many whites are unable to withstand such
challenges, a condition Robin DiAngelo has termed "white fragility."
**[White fragility is the anger, defensiveness, and frustration that
"racial stress" triggers in whites; stress that can be induced by simply
naming structures of white privilege that are meant to be
invisible.]{.underline}** Identifying whiteness is jarring because of
the widespread assumption that being white means having an "unracialized
identity or location." Whiteness, as DiAngelo pointed out, "is not
recognized or named" because it is presumed to be "a universal reference
point."47 In the white voice of AI commentary, the pretense to
universality is obvious, and the idea of "universal" intelligence has
been one of AI's major epistemic forgeries. Yet interruptions of white
universality are rare, whether in AI or elsewhere, because, as DiAngelo
writes, many whites inhabit "racially insular" environments where
interlocutors who could "racialize" white people's understandings and
experiences are absent. **[The discourse on AI has likewise developed
within such racially insular spheres, and so the white voice of AI
expertise generally goes uninterrupted. In cases where AI has been
challenged, however, the critics were often met with contempt,
demonstrating AI's white fragility. Even critiques of the concept of AI
on narrow grounds provoked extreme defensiveness from practitioners and
were sometimes recorded in AI's histories as moments of
crisis.]{.underline}** As we saw previously, when the mathematician
James Lighthill--- who thought "the general purpose robot is a
mirage"--- challenged AI's coherence as a field, he was met with
derision, and practitioners blamed later funding shortages for AI on his
critique. More general critiques, such as those offered by the
philosopher Hubert Dreyfus--- which we will revisit in the next
chapter--- were met with even greater hostility. Dreyfus was said to be
merely validating "his passionately held preconceptions," of engaging in
an "infra dig" quest to "discredit" the AI community, and prominent
practitioners have broadly accused critics of using "arguments of
emotion" or having "animosity" toward the field of AI.48 But while these
critiques evoked great hostility, they weren't grounded in the
understanding of AI as a technology of whiteness. **[To challenge AI as
a technology of whiteness means taking seriously how its nebulous and
shifting character serves power. This entails not only challenging AI's
models of the self and their epistemic forgeries but also the legitimacy
of the expert industry that gives the pursuit of AI its destructive
powers and superficial coherence. Challenging, in other words, the
institutions that sustain the endeavor.]{.underline}**

The 'wounded attachments' of political whiteness In her 1995 book States
of Injury, Wendy Brown argued that [progressive movements tended to
coalesce around 'wounded identities' that **demanded recognition** and
protection, whether from hate speech, harassment or
violence.]{.underline} For Brown (1995: 55), [such politics not only
reified said identities but ontologised trauma, producing a 'politics of
recrimination and rancor' with **deep investments in victimisation** and
suffering. Second-wave feminism in particular, Brown argued, had
instantiated 'woman' as an identity based on injury]{.underline}. She
interpreted feminist consciousness-raising and the 'speak out' as akin
to Foucault's (1978) 'modern confessional' in their production of
accounts that could be appropriated by punitive (and therapeutic) state
governmentalities. Solidifying the 'truth' of women's experience through
'speaking out', she contended, was not necessarily liberation (Brown
1995: 42). As I have argued elsewhere (Phipps, 2019), [the 'wounded
attachments' Brown attributed to feminism are likely to be those of
middle-class whiteness, given the domination of both first and second
waves of mainstream feminism by bourgeois white women (such as myself)
(Ware, 1992: 18). By 'mainstream feminism', I largely mean
Anglo-American public feminism. This includes media feminism (and some
forms of social media feminism), institutional feminism, corporate
feminism and **policy feminism**]{.underline}. This is [not a cohesive
and unified movement, but it **has clear directions and
effects**.]{.underline} Building on HoSang (2010[), I call the modus
operandi of this feminism '**political whiteness'**. This goes beyond
the implicitly or explicitly 'whites first' orientation of most politics
dominated by white people: it has a **complex affective landscape**
involving attachments to the self]{.underline} (often the wounded self)
and to power (often in the form of the state). These attachments produce
a number of dynamics: narcissism, alertness to threat (which in white
women's case is often sexualised), and an accompanying need for control.
Political whiteness characterises both mainstream feminism and the
backlash against it, as they 'battle it out' (Banet-Weiser, 2018: 1) on
the contemporary cultural stage. [Victimhood is **central to these
battles**]{.underline} (Banet-Weiser, 2018: 4). Women's sexual
victimisation has been at the forefront of recent mainstream feminist
campaigns, exemplified by actions such as the Women's March as well as
the viral iteration of #MeToo. Responding to this, the backlash has been
preoccupied with who the real victims are. One of its central claims is
that 'feminism has gone too far' (Nicholas and Aguis, 2017: 31), and
that men are now fearful because harmless touching has been defined as
abuse. These narratives are bolstered by broader stories of white
victimhood which have underpinned Brexit, the election of Trump, and the
elevation of other far-right figures and parties worldwide (Corredor,
2019). Crying 'white-lady tears' On International Men's Day 2019, Good
Morning Britain host Piers Morgan broadcast a monologue comparing
middle-class white men to endangered rhinos. 'Yes, we do need a day', he
said. 'We are now the most downtrodden group of men in the world'.
Assertions such as this, from the heart of the backlash, have been given
short shrift by white feminists who often use the idiom of 'male tears'.
In 2014, writer Jessica Valenti tweeted a picture of herself wearing a
T-shirt with the slogan: I BATHE IN MALE TEARS (Phipps, 2020: 69).
However, [white feminists have been slower to acknowledge our own
tendency to be lachrymose, which is often an attempt to **avoid**
accountability in response to criticism by women of colour.
Historically, bourgeois white women's power has been based on ideas of
virtue and goodness (]{.underline}Ware, 1992: 37--38): as Hamad (2019:
105) argues, [this makes being criticised for bad behaviour deeply
threatening. White women can also be so invested in our oppression as
women that we resist addressing our privilege as white]{.underline}
(Accapadi, 2007: 208). Robin di Angelo (2011: 57) argues that [white
people in general exist in a **state of fragility** 'in which even a
**minimum amount** of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering
defensive moves'.]{.underline} di Angelo has been critiqued for her
individualised focus on selfimprovement rather than structural change
(Jackson, 2019). [However, an understanding of whiteness as the
**performance of structural supremacy** still involves fragility,
whether this is the angry brittleness of hegemonic white masculinity or
the 'delicacy' of white bourgeois **femininity (the source of its
power).** If anger is the main expression of white power in a masculine
register, **tears are its feminine** equivalent. 'Tear', as a both a
noun and a verb, has multiple meanings: bourgeois white womanhood both
tears (in the sense of becoming torn or damaged), and consequently tears
(in the sense of tearing up), easily. This 'damsel in distress' evokes a
protective response: and simultaneously, colonial archetypes of people
of colour as aggressive and frightening come into play. This is the
pretext on which white men, enraged, tear the place apart.]{.underline}
Hamad (2019: 105) terms this Strategic White Womanhood, a historical
dynamic which endures in the contemporary, in various forms. She
recounts a relevant incident in 2018 involving Cambridge professors Mary
Beard and Priyamvada Gopal. Beard was challenged by Gopal and others
over a tweet she had posted on allegations of sexual abuse by Oxfam
staff in Haiti and elsewhere. 'I do wonder how hard it must be to
sustain civilised values in a war zone', it said. In response to
criticism, Beard tweeted a picture of herself crying; afterwards, Gopal
in particular was the target of racist attacks (Hamad 2019: 102--105).
For Hamad (2019: 25, 229), this exemplifies the abusive relationship
women of colour have with white womanhood. [When the going gets tough,
she argues, white women 'turn their sanctioned victim status' on women
of colour. While privileged white women bathe in male tears, women of
colour can drown in ours. Our sanctioned victim status shields
privileged white women from accountability in interpersonal interactions
and in the political sphere.]{.underline} In her discussion of the 2017
Women's March, Brittney Cooper (2018: 182) highlighted exit polls that
found 53 percent of white women voted for Trump, compared to 94 percent
of Black women who voted for Clinton (despite their reservations).
Watching white women protest Trump's election, she wrote, when we were
partly responsible for it, felt like 'an exercise in whitelady tears if
I ever saw one'. Read in a structural way, the Women's March could be
seen as an action that hid white women's complicity in Trump's success
(Phipps, 2020: 120) -- in Hamad's terms, Strategic White Womanhood writ
large. Phipps 85 In May 2019, Theresa May wept outside 10 Downing Street
as she resigned the UK premiership. [These **tears did political
work,**]{.underline} creating amnesia in some quarters over May's record
as Prime Minister, and previously as Home Secretary. Perhaps most
strikingly, domestic abuse charity Women's Aid posted a (subsequently
deleted) tweet thanking May for her service to women and survivors.
[This prompted a critical response: prior to her resignation, May had
failed to guarantee that women's refuges would not close as part of an
overhaul of supported housing. In 2015, she had been accused of allowing
'state-sanctioned' rape and abuse of vulnerable migrant women at the
Yarl's Wood detention centre.]{.underline} Her government presided over
the rollout of Universal Credit, the punitive benefits system that has
made it more difficult for women to leave abusive relationships. It
appeared that, for some, May's tears washed these acts out of the
picture (Phipps, 2020: 70). haunting photo. Whatever you think about
Theresa May\'s record as prime minister, it\'s impossible not to feel
sorry for her as a person'.3 This attempt to separate the personal and
political is central to white women's tears as a strategic device. We
demand to be treated as 'just a person' who should be granted the
benefit of the doubt, who exists outside racialised structures and power
relations even as our actions perpetuate them. [However, while
privileged **white feminists deny** the **relationship between** the
**personal and** the **political in response** to critique, in our own
theory and politics this relationship (and in particular, our own
personal experience or that of women like us) takes centre stage. This
is more than just hypocrisy; it is white supremacy. Whether we deny or
emphasise the relationship between the personal and political, white
women's tears enable us to centre ourselves and marginalise women of
colour]{.underline}. In an article on #MeToo, Jamilah Lemieux (2017)
commented, 'white women know how to be victims. [**They know just how to
bleed** **and weep** in the public square, they fundamentally understand
that they are entitled to sympathy'.]{.underline} Lemieux was not
claiming the disclosures of #MeToo were not genuine; she was
highlighting the power brought to mainstream feminism by the power of
white women's tears. White-lady tears, to use Cooper's phrase: bourgeois
white women's tears are the ultimate symbol of femininity, evoking the
damsel in distress and the mourning, lamenting women of myth (Phipps,
2020: 71). It is likely that this power is not fully accessible to
working-class white women, who are often figures of classed disgust
(Tyler, 2008). While it might date back to the ancients[, the power of
bourgeois white women's tears was solidified in the modern colonial
period, as 'women's protection' became key to the deadly disciplinary
power that maintained racialised and classed regimes of extraction and
exploitation. White tears, white rage, white personhood White supremacy
produces both white tears and white rage, and colonialism relied on a
circuit between bourgeois white women's tears and white men's punitive
power]{.underline}. This was often activated by the vocabulary of rape:
Indigenous, colonised and enslaved men were maimed and killed after
allegations made by bourgeois white women (Ware, 1992: 11, 37). As
Angela Davis (1981: 106--111) argues, [both mass rape of Black women and
allegations of rape against Black men have been instruments of white
supremacy (]{.underline}Davis, 1981: 106--111[). In earlier phases of
capitalism, rape laws functioned to protect upperclass men, whose wives
or daughters (their property) might be violated (Davis, 1981: 101). In
the genocidally violent relations of theft, capture and chattel that
characterised colonial capitalism, rape prohibitions took on similar
meanings at the levels of community, nation and race.]{.underline} In
colonial Australia, rape was a 'violation of female purity' punishable
by death: politicians insisted this was necessary to keep Aboriginal and
'disreputable' (poor) white men under control (Kaladelfos, 2012: 159).
The vulnerable bourgeois white woman was central to accounts of
insurrections such as the Indian Mutiny and the Morant Bay uprising in
Jamaica (Ware, 1992: 39--42): fear of rape was fear of revolution. In
the United States, following the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863,
white Americans used lynching to terrorise and control Black people.
Rape of a white woman was one of the most common pretexts for attacks on
growing Black social and economic power (Ware, 1992: 179--182). In 1921,
white mobs (many of them deputised and/or given weapons by city
officials) killed between 100 and 300 Black people and destroyed 1000
houses in Greenwood, Tulsa, after a Black man was falsely accused of
assaulting a white female elevator operator. Greenwood Avenue had been
known as 'Black Wall Street' because it was one of the most affluent
African-American communities of the early 20th century (Madigan, 2001).
The story of Emmett Till is perhaps the best-known of this history of
what Sharpe (2016: 15) calls the 'ongoingness of the conditions of
capture'. A 14-year-old Till was brutalised and killed by two white men
in Mississippi in 1955, after Carolyn Bryant falsely accused him of
'uttering obscenities' and grabbing her by the waist. Jessie Daniels
(2018) has called Bryant 'the foremother of contemporary white women who
call the police on Black people sitting in a Starbucks, barbecuing in a
park or napping in a dorm', acts that have also led to fatal violence
(Sharpe, 2016: 52). [The 2020 Black Lives Matter protests following the
police murder of George Floyd reiterated that Black lives are still the
price of white affective security]{.underline} (see Schuller, 2018: 2),
and [Black death is still crucial to the operation of the white
supremacist state]{.underline} (see Sharpe, 2016: 9). White women's
'safety' is also central to contemporary border regimes, which purport
to protect us from immigrants and traffickers but actually create the
conditions for mass exploitation and abuse (Mac and Smith, 2018: 59--60,
75--76). [Political whiteness involves a will to power: in the case of
bourgeois white women, this was and is often achieved through
performances of powerlessness. We exist at the intersections of
capitalism, white supremacy and heteropatriarchy, with little control
over the means of production]{.underline} (Lugones, 2008: 15) but with
raced and classed dominance that requires feminine submission. Like
Penelope in Homer's Odyssey, we fling ourselves on the floor and cry.
This activates the settler's and master's revenge, now embodied in the
necropolitical (Mbembe, 2003) criminal punishment and border control
that captures Black and brown people and/or leaves them to perish: what
Sharpe (2016: 16) terms [the 'reappearance of the slave ship in everyday
life'. This circuit between white tears and white rage means that the
relationship between the personal and political in white feminism has
always been corruptible or perhaps even inherently corrupt. In contrast
to the damsel in distress, the woman of colour has had her innocence
stripped by colonialism,]{.underline} often through rape (Hamad, 2019:
18--19). As Angela Davis Phipps 87 (1981) argues, colonial ideas about
Black sexual 'savagery' created both the notions of the Black man as
rapist and the Black woman as un-rapeable, encased in the notion of
Black people's bodies as objects to which anything could be done
(Sharpe, 2016: 13). During #MeToo, the only allegations Harvey Weinstein
publicly refuted were from actors Salma Hayek and Lupita Nyong'o: Hamad
(2018: 55) argues that this was because brown and Black women are easier
to discredit. Women of colour, and particularly [Black women, are not
able to politicise their pain in the way white women do: this both
reflects and perpetuates their thingification]{.underline} (Césaire,
1950: 42) and 'abjection from the realm of the human' (Sharpe, 2016:
12).4 [It is not just that the tears of white women are valued while
those of Black women are dismissed. It is that race itself (and perhaps
class, at least to a certain extent) is defined by the perceived
capacity to cry, that the performance of bourgeois white emotion
accomplishes the dehumanisation of people of colour.]{.underline} As
Kyla Schuller (2018) has shown, in 19th-century sex and race 'science',
ideas about sex difference (seen as a property of bourgeois whiteness)
intermingled with ideas about feeling. This divided the 'civilised' body
into two halves: 'the sentimental woman . . . and the less susceptible
and more rational man' (Schuller 2018: 16[). The bourgeois white woman's
capacity to cry was fundamental to her dominant status, as was the
capacity of her male counterpart to respond to her tears with action.
Humanness came to refer to both an assumed capacity for feeling and
**the capacity to control it.**]{.underline}

[Modernity is sutured by this hold]{.underline}. [This movement of
things, unformed objects, deformed subjects, nothing yet and already.
This movement of nothing is not just the origin of modern
logistics,]{.underline} [but the annunciation of modernity itself, and
not just the annunciation of modernity itself but the insurgent prophesy
that all of modernity will have at its heart, in its own hold, this
movement of things, this interdicted, outlawed social life of
nothing]{.underline}. Te work of Sandro Mazzadra and 94 THE UNDERCOMMONS
Brett Neilson on borders for instance reminds us that [the proliferation
of borders between states, within states, between people, within people
is a proliferation of states of statelessness. These borders grope their
way toward the movement of things, bang on containers, kick at hostels,
harass camps, shout after fugitives, seeking all the time to harness
this movement of things, this logisticality]{.underline}. But [this
fails to happen, borders fail to cohere, because the movement of things
will not cohere. This logisticality will not cohere. It is, as Sara
Ahmed says, queer disorientation, the absence of coherence, but not of
things, in the moving presence of absolutely nothing.]{.underline} As
Frank B. Wilderson III teaches us, [the improvisational imperative is,
therefore, "to stay in the hold of the ship, despite my fantasies of
fight."]{.underline} But this is to say that there are fights of fantasy
in the hold of the ship. The ordinary fugue and fugitive run of the
language lab, black phonography's brutally experimental venue.
[Paraontological totality is in the making. Present and unmade in
presence, blackness is an instrument in the making]{.underline}. Quasi
una fantasia in its paralegal swerve, its mad-worked braid, the
imagination produces nothing but exsense in the hold. Do you remember
the days of slavery? Nathaniel Mackey rightly says "The world was ever
after/elsewhere,/no/way where we were/was there." No way where we are is
here. [Where we were, where we are, is what we meant by
"mu,"]{.underline} which Wilderson would rightly call ["the void of our
subjectivity." And so it is we remain in the hold]{.underline}, [in the
break, as if entering again and again the broken world, to trace the
visionary company and join]{.underline} [it]{.underline}. [This
contrapuntal island, where we are marooned in search of marronage, where
we linger in stateless emergency, in our our lysed cell and held
dislocation, our blown standpoint and lyred chapel, in (the) study of
our sea-born variance, sent by its pre-history into arrivance without
arrival, as a poetics of lore, of abnormal articulation, where the
relation between joint and flesh is the folded distance of a musical
moment that is emphatically, palpably imperceptible and, therefore,
difcult to describe. Having defeid degradation the moment becomes a
theory of the moment, of the feeling of a presence that is ungraspable
in the way that it touches.]{.underline} [This musical moment -- the
moment of advent, of nativity in all its terrible beauty, in the
alienation that is always already born in and as parousia]{.underline}
FANTASY IN THE HOLD 95 -- [is a precise and rigorous description/theory
of the social life of the shipped, the terror of enjoyment in its
endlessly redoubled folds]{.underline}. If you take up the hopelessly
imprecise tools of standard navigation, the deathly reckoning of
diference engines, maritime clocks and tables of damned assurance, you
might stumble upon such a moment about two and a half minutes into
"Mutron," a duet by Ed Blackwell and Don Cherry recorded in 1982. You'll
know the moment by how it requires you to think the relation between
fantasy and nothingness: what is mistaken for silence is, all of a
sudden, transubstantial. The brutal interplay of advent and chamber
demands the continual instigation of fown, recursive imagining; to do so
is to inhabit an architecture and its acoustic, but to inhabit as if in
an approach from outside; not only to reside in this unlivability but
also to discover and enter it. Mackey, in the preface to his unbearably
beautiful Splay Anthem, outlining the provenance and relationship
between the book's serial halves ("Each was given its impetus by a piece
of recorded music from which it takes its title, the Dogon 'Song of the
Andoumboulou,' in one case, Don Cherry's \[and Ed Blackwell's\] 'Mu'
First Part and 'Mu' Second Part in the other") speaks of mu in relation
to a circling or spiraling or ringing, this roundness or rondo linking
beginning and end, and to the wailing that accompanies entrance into and
expulsion from sociality. But his speaking makes you wonder if music,
which is not only music, is mobilized in the service of an eccentricity,
a centrifugal force whose intimation Mackey also approaches, marking
sociality's ecstatic existence beyond beginning and end, ends and means,
out where one becomes interested in things, in a certain relationship
between thingliness and nothingness and blackness that plays itself out
in unmapped, unmappable, undercommon consent and consensuality.
[Blackness is the site where absolute nothingness and the world of
things converge. Blackness is fantasy in the hold and Wilderson's access
to it is in that he is one who has nothing and is, therefore, both more
and less than one. He is the shipped. We are the shipped, if we choose
to be, if we elect to pay an unbearable cost that is inseparable from an
incalculable benefit]{.underline}

#### The alternative is anti-hegemonic technology: a refusal of technical networks of oppression and efficiency in favor of grassroots praxis towards technology as a radical imaginary.

As a CSCW researcher and an individual committed to the cause of public
accountability toward the hegemonic culture of technology, the most
important thing I have gathered along the way is hope for a liberatory
future of technology and society, for [resistance to a hegemonic culture
of technology is not only possible it is **already happening**. There is
massive inequality on the side of resistance, we are outnumbered and
over-exhausted, but we are here.]{.underline} The Southern Movement
Assembly (SMA) frequently uses a slogan that goes "the seas are rising
and so are we"---I have always taken several quiet moments to fully
grasp the power in that slogan---all the countless times I have heard
it. It speaks to the impossible challenge many communities---mostly
indigenous, poor people of color living in coastal areas of the
South---face against the rising temperature of the earth, the sea
levels, and the climate capitalism driving it all. The slogan, "so are
we" carries a stubborn faith in the power of the people, in their
collective anger, because they are not only rising in number they are
rising in their consciousness, visions, and strategies too. The
consequences of climate change are more immediate and more fatal than
the consequences of Big Tech in these communities, but if I had to take
away a pearl of singular wisdom from the epistemologies of the 160
South, it would be to never lose focus on the intersecting ways
capitalism operates. [Technologies **of oppression** are connected and
mobilized, we who refuse to let them win have to be too]{.underline}.
[The slogan is also a reminder of the fact that no matter how big and
overwhelming systems of oppression and erasure look like, the resistance
can be just as loud and overpowering.]{.underline} In my vision[, a
grassroots praxis of technology]{.underline}--one that I studied,
designed, and theorized throughout this dissertation---[will facilitate
a carefully nuanced analysis of technology structures in the future.
This future calls for a synergistic effort from both theory and
practice]{.underline}---a phenomenon theorized in Chapter 2 of this
thesis in the name of praxis. Portuguese economist Boaventura de Sousa
Santos whose book "Epistemologies of the South: Justice Against
Epistemicide" has substantively influenced my writing in this thesis,
notes an ever-growing distance between theory and practice in the
political Left. He describes in great detail how this distance has been
well warranted, especially since "Eurocentric critical theory (and the
political Left it founded) has not acknowledged: women, indigenous
peoples, peasants, Afro-descendants, piqueteros, the unemployed, gays
and lesbians, and the Occupy movement"---movements and social groups
that---"dwell not in industrial urban centers but rather in remote
sites, whether in the forests and river basins in India or up in the
Andes and in the larger plains of Amazonia" \[7\]. With this, Santos
paints an important but frequently overlooked picture of the Global
South and its deeply diverse epistemologies. While he sees the value in
Eurocentric critical theory, he poses that it has perpetuated a deep
discrepancy between what is stated in theory and what is happening in
the field of liberation around the world---a discrepancy deeply rooted
in the fact that these theories ignored the political existence of these
global struggles. However, the disconnect between theory and practice
has come with significant consequences for the political Left. For
example, it has been largely failing at identifying what it is up
against: is it aiming at replacing capitalism with a post-capitalist
future, or is it attempting to replace neoliberalism with a type of
capitalism with a more human face? I posit that the same can be argued
for how we understand technology at the moment---our theories about
technology getting detached from our understandings of contemporary
technology practices carry the risk of this ambiguity too. Do we want
161 to build technologies toward that post-capitalist future? Or do we
want to replace one capitalist technoculture with another? As a
well-documented example for the latter, we can take the trend of
replacing the technoculture of product design with the technoculture of
"design thinking" led by Silicon Valley \[85\]. A grassroots praxis of
technology---grounded in epistemologies of the Global South including
the U.S. South---will urge designers, researchers, practitioners to take
the former stance. [What does it mean to take this stance---practically
and intellectually?]{.underline} In Chapter 3, I reflected on what
grassroots culture means for the regional movement of the SMA. Their
[commitment to grassroots praxis can be seen in the way they designed
their movement structure, their mode of participatory decision-making,
and perhaps most importantly how they stay ideologically open to form
global solidarities.]{.underline} In my experience of the movement,
[they refuse to compromise on this commitment to grassroots culture for
the sake of efficacy or political coherence]{.underline}. [While the
hegemonic culture of technology drove the movement to choose technical
efficiency over inclusivity at time]{.underline}s---the movement was
fundamentally open to its growth beyond that pattern. [A grassroots
praxis of technology will similarly stay vigilant of the way the
hegemonic technology culture may interfere with its
commitment]{.underline}. For this, [we]{.underline} will [need to
sustain a culture of technology that prioritizes its own accountability,
especially prioritizes to be held accountable by the people and
communities hegemonic cultures have excluded for so long]{.underline}. A
grassroots praxis of technology will be centered on community
accountability. [Accountability in this sense is not just an evaluation
of how smoothly our tools function in communities, it is also an
evaluation of whether our tools (and our designer selves) are needed in
the community at all.]{.underline} As discussed in Chapter 4, [my work
with the SMA was a constant exploration in finding what works for the
community]{.underline}---[this required me to reject the
belief]{.underline} often perpetuated in institutions of technology i.e.
[as technology scholars our only way to help communities is with new
sociotechnical solutions involving novel artifacts]{.underline}. [A
preoccupation with novelty in technical artifice is both misguided and
narrow-sighted. I was working with a community that carried wisdom
predating industrial visions of the modern
world]{.underline}---[wisdom]{.underline} 162 [that was rooted in their
survival against forced labor, migration, dehumanization of their core
identities. Learning from how they relate to modern technology as well
as what their technological imaginaries are proved to be more important
and necessary than creating a novel technical "solution"]{.underline} in
the name of grassroots design. Toward prioritizing community
accountability, [a grassroots praxis of technology will similarly
prioritize marginalized cultures and their radical imaginaries over
Eurocentric measures of technical e‑cacy and advancement.]{.underline}

#### The alternative is black radical technology: as a creative form of black expression within rebellion, resistance, and historicity.

Foundation ;Say It Loud, I\'m Black and I\'m Proud: African Americans,
American Artifactual Culture, and Black Vernacular Technological
Creativity <https://www.jstor.org/stable/40068387>) Sameer V

[African American technological experiences need to be studied to alter
the current discourse of American technology]{.underline}, rather than
to multiculturalize our narrow understanding of technology in America.
With new multicultural and multiracial approaches to understanding the
nature of technology and American culture, traditional narratives can no
longer produce, contain, and maintain the explanatory power they once
possessed. To develop a more thoughtful analysis of African American
technological experiences, we need to think differently about the
questions we ask and the tools we use to answer those questions.
[Technological knowledge must be interrogated, because it is
inextricably intertwined with relations of power that are regularly
applied to regulate black existences.]{.underline} Stuart Hall writes,
\"Knowledge linked to power not only assumes the authority of \'the
truth\' but has the power to make itself true. All knowledge, once
applied in the real world has real effects, and in that sense at least,
\'becomes true.\'\"76 Following from Hall, it can be said that [what we
know about the relations between black people and
technology]{.underline} primarily comes from dominant subject positions
that unfortunately [tell us more about how African Americans are
controlled and regulated than about how black people engage technology
from their own locations]{.underline} [within American
culture]{.underline}. [The existing approaches used to understand
technology]{.underline} [in American society and culture overlook
racialized power and conflict]{.underline} when they reduce everything
to various forms of negotiation. This is not to implicate or label
social theories of technology as forms of epistemological imperialism in
the manner in which Edward Said writes about orientalism; but Said\'s
thoughts are insightful.77 In writing about colonialism and imperialism,
Said inveighs that \"both are supported and perhaps even impelled by
impressive ideological formations that include notions that certain
territories and people require and beseech domination, as well as forms
of knowledge affiliated with domination.\"78 Just as the intellectual
work of which Said writes is tainted from the very beginning, [social
theories of technology are besmirched by similar dominant cultural ef-
forts that are intended to maintain domination, but are concealed within
the rhetoric of flexibility and freedom. To gain a deeper understanding
of black vernacular technological creativity]{.underline}, [it is vital
to examine the experiences of African Americans]{.underline} [from where
they stand in]{.underline} American [society and culture]{.underline}
[rather than from the dominant position reflecting back on black
lives]{.underline}. [Black vernacular technological creativity is rich
in historical value and replete with rebellion, resistance,
assimilation, and appropriation in forms we would often not recognize
and in places we are not accustomed to looking.]{.underline} [It is from
this space that we can see how black people reclaim a level of
technological agency by redeploying, reconceiving, and re-creating
material artifacts in their world]{.underline}. By focusing on black
vernacular technological creativity and engaging in uncovering the
multiple layers of black communities and their interactions with
technology, we can avoid making the \"they are all the same\"
essentialization of the marginalized mistake regarding African
Americans.79 [Technology is often thought of as a value-neutral \"black
box\" for inputs and outputs.]{.underline} [Critical studies of
technology have opened the black box]{.underline}, but [there are many
hidden compartments that]{.underline} still [need to be
explored]{.underline}. [To access these concealed compartments, or the
\"blackness\" in the black box, we need to reassess and expand our study
of technology to examine how racially marginalized people, such as
African Americans, interact with technology and how technology mediates
multiple African American experiences with racism]{.underline}. To
address African Americans and technology, we must think about the ways
in which black people see race and racism - important realities of
everyday black existence. This is difficult because [race and racism, in
relation to technology, have always been hidden in a]{.underline}
mysterious [place of \"unlocation.]{.underline}\"80 [By
uncovering]{.underline} [African Americans creating technological
artifacts, practices, and knowledge that have become parts of the
American material and technological cultures, black people will become
visible metaphorically and materially]{.underline}. [This work will
enable black people to move out of the shadows, lift the veil, remove
the mask, and solidify and develop]{.underline} [decidedly positive
technological representations and existences for African Americans
within American society and culture.]{.underline}

#### Vote negative for an ethic of abolition to [refuse]{.underline} to breathe life into hegemonic security studies. Only the alternative creates the conditions for a new vision of study that avoids the pitfalls of anti-black redemption.

It is perhaps the most harmless of the 'three little words', **[but
'studies' contains all we need to know of hierarchies and
cuts]{.underline}** -- of the 'human' from the world, of the knowing
subject from the object to be known and 'studied'. For critical security
studies, **[the study itself is already the violence that enables the
violence of 'sustained discrimination']{.underline}**, the violence that
we are told is both 'invisible and acceptable' (Security Dialogue,
2020). Study is a practice of the world of the subject, the world of
critical security, the world of anti-Blackness. **[Yes, 'study' as a
concept could be reclaimed for a world beyond anti-Blackness, but this
would not be the 'study' that demarcates one 'field' from
anothe]{.underline}**r. Fred Moten and Stefano Harney (2013: 118), for
example, talk of **[study as the disruption of the grounds that would
enable the study of 'studies']{.underline}**. This form of study **[is
the refusal of the settled order of academia]{.underline}**, the
**[flight from the institutional demands of
disciplinarit]{.underline}**y, the **[embrace of dissonance instead of
clarity]{.underline}**. Study is **[the reason for the abolition of
critical security studies]{.underline}**, the reason why you would
**[leave the world of policy and academia]{.underline}**,
**[not]{.underline}** why you would **[seek to expand it]{.underline}**.
**[Study is the work and the interaction and the care that is in the
world. 'Study' is not the product of critical security
studies]{.underline}**; **[it can only be what critical security studies
sets itself against, to carve itself out of, to separate itself
from]{.underline}**. Critical security studies can no more undertake
this form of study than it can engage with 'questions of race and
racism'. Conclusion

What, then, does it mean for the field **[if the grounds of critical
security studies are the grounds of anti-Blackness]{.underline}**? Not
'just' the 'foundations' but the grounds that enable the divide between
the 'foundations' and the 'novel and ethico-politically committed ways'
(Security Dialogue, 2020) to be discovered in the present or in the
future. **[The grounds that enable the authorized critical
security]{.underline}** studies **[subject to articulate the desire for
'reparation' and for 'ethico-politically committed ways']{.underline}**
to enable the **[continuation of a project that has no ground of its
own]{.underline}**. The investigation of **[anti-Blackness we have
presented suggests that, at an ontological level, only questions of race
and racism exist, and critical security studies is a form of their
expression]{.underline}**. To reiterate our position: we have sought to
make two fairly straightforward points. First, on the questions of race
and racism, there is a possibility that **[no reparative
ethico-political openings can be made from within the subject position
of critical security studie]{.underline}**s. **[To pursue this
reparative project would require the reinstatement of the series of
closures and exclusions that constitute the hegemonic imaginaries of the
discipline]{.underline}**. Second, critical security scholars should
consider whether in fact there can be any repair-ation or repair of
critical security studies. We build on the important existing critiques
of race in security studies to argue that to take seriously the question
of race and racism would clarify the difficulty, perhaps even the
impossibility, of any reparation. Indeed, **[perhaps the only
possibility of a truly novel and ethical future lies in abolition of the
entire intellectual, institutional, ontological edifice that critical
security studies is embedded in]{.underline}**. As [Harney and Moten

#### Their understanding of the state as [unified]{.underline}, [immutable]{.underline}, and [inevitably dangerous]{.underline} to Indigenous actors creates a [pessimism trap]{.underline} that [stifles]{.underline} Indigenous agency and activism. 

**Lightfoot, 20**---associate professor in First Nations and Indigenous
Studies and the Department of Political Science, University of British
Columbia, Ojibwe (Sheryl, "The Pessimism Traps of Indigenous
Resurgence," *Pessimism in International Relations*, Chapter 9, pp
162-170, SpringerLink, dml)

[Pessimism Trap 2: The State is **Unified**, **Deliberate** and
**Unchanging** in Its Desire to **Dispossess**]{.underline} Indigenous
Peoples [and **Gain Unfettered Access** to Indigenous Lands]{.underline}
and Resources [In other words, colonialism by settler states is a
**constant**, **not a variable**, in both **outcome** and
**intent**]{.underline}. Further, the state is not only intentionally
colonial, but it is also unifed in its desire to co-opt Indigenous
peoples as a method and means of control. In 2005's Wasase, Alfred
presents the state as unitary, intentional and unchanging in its desire
to colonise and oppress Indigenous peoples noting, 'I think that the
only thing that has changed since our ancestors first declared war on
the invaders is that some of us have lost heart'.22 Referring to current
state policies as a 'self-termination movement', Alfred states, 'It is
senseless to advocate for an accord with imperialism while there is a
steady and intense ongoing attack by the Settler society on everything
meaningful to us: our cultures, our communities, and our deep
attachments to land'.23 Alfred's Peace, Power, Righteousness (2009) also
argues that the state is deliberate and unchanging, stating quite
plainly that 'it is still the objective of the Canadian and US
governments to remove Indians, or, failing that, to prevent them from
benefitting, from their ancestral territories'.24 Contemporary states do
this, he argues, not through outright violent control but 'by
insidiously promoting a form of neo-colonial self-government in our
communities and forcing our integration into the legal mainstream'.25
According to Alfred, the state 'relegates indigenous peoples' rights to
the past, and constrains the development of their societies by allowing
only those activities that support its own necessary illusion: that
indigenous peoples today do not present a serious challenge to its
legitimacy'.26 Linking back to the aim of co-option, Alfred argues that
while the state's desire to control Indigenous peoples and lands has
never changed, the techniques for doing so have become subtler over
time. 'Recognizing the power of the indigenous challenge and unable to
deny it a voice', due to successful Indigenous resistance over the
years, 'the state has (now) attempted to pull indigenous people closer
to it'.27 According to Alfred, the state has outwitted Indigenous
leaders and 'encouraged them to reframe and moderate their nationhood
demands to accept the fait accompli of colonization, (and) to
collaborate in the development of a "solution" that does not challenge
the fundamental imperial lie'.28 In a similar vein, Coulthard's central
argument is centred on his understanding of the dual structure of
colonialism. Drawing directly from Fanon, Coulthard finds that
colonialism relies on both objective and subjective elements. The
objective components involve domination through the political, economic
and legal structures of the colonial state. The subjective elements of
colonialism involve the creation of 'colonized subjects', including a
process of internalisation by which colonised subjects come to not only
accept the limited forms of 'misrecognition' granted through the state
but can even come to identify with it.29 Through this dual structure,
colonial power now works through the inclusion of Indigenous peoples,
actively shaping their perspectives in line with state discourses,
rather than merely excluding them, as in years past. Therefore, any
attempt to seek 'the reconciliation of Indigenous nationhood with state
sovereignty is still colonial insofar as it remains structurally
committed to the dispossession of Indigenous peoples of our lands and
self-determining authority'.30 Concerning the state in relation to
Indigenous peoples on the international level, Corntassel argues that
states and global organisations, for years, have been consistently
framing Indigenous peoples' self-determination claims in ways that
'jeopardize the futures of indigenous communities'.31 He claims that
states frst compartmentalise Indigenous self-determination by separating
lands and resources from political and legal recognition of a limited
autonomy. Second, he notes, states sometimes deny the existence of
Indigenous peoples living within their borders. Thirdly, a political and
legal entitlement framing by states deemphasises other responsibilities.
Finally, he claims that states, through the rights discourse, limit the
frameworks through which Indigenous peoples can seek self-determination.
Like Alfred and Coulthard, Corntassel has concluded that states are
deliberate and never changing in their behaviour. With [this
move]{.underline}, Corntassel [**limits** and actually **demeans
Indigenous agency**, **overlooking** the reality that **Indigenous
organisations themselves** chose the **human rights framework** and
**rights discourse** as a target sphere of action **precisely because**,
as was **evident** in earlier struggles like **slavery**, **civil
rights** or **women's rights**, these were **tools available to them**
that had a **proven track record of opening up new possibilities** and
**shifting previous state positions** and **behaviour**. Indigenous
advocates also **cleverly realised**]{.underline}, by the 1970s, [that
the **anti-discrimination** and **decolonisation frames** could be
**used together against states**. States did, **in no way**,
**nefariously impose a rights framework** on Indigenous peoples. Rather,
Indigenous organisations and savvy Indigenous political actors
**deliberately chose** to frame their self-determination struggles
**within the human rights framework** in order to **bring states into a
double bind** where they **could not credibly claim** to adhere to human
rights and claim that they uphold equality while **simultaneously
denying Indigenous peoples' human rights** and leaving them with a
**diminished** and **unequal right of self-determination**]{.underline}.
But, because he is caught in [the pessimism trap of **seeing the state
only as unified**, **deliberate** and **unchanging**]{.underline},
Corntassel [**overlooks** and **diminishes** the clear story of
**Indigenous agency** and the **potential for positive change** in
advancing self-determination in a multitude of ways]{.underline}.
[Pessimism Trap 3: **Engagement** with the Settler State is
**Futile**]{.underline}, if Not Counter-Productive [Since the state
always intends to **maintain**, if not **expand**, **colonial
control**]{.underline}, and is seeking to co-opt as many Indigenous
peoples as possible in order to maintain or expand its dispossession and
control, [it is therefore **futile**]{.underline}, at best,
[and]{.underline} actually [**dangerous** to Indigenous existence to
engage with the state]{.underline}. Furthermore, [**all patterns of
engagement** will lead to **co-optation** as the state is **cunning**
and **unrelenting** in its desire to co-opt]{.underline} Indigenous
leaders, academics and professionals in order to gain or maintain
control of [Indigenous peoples]{.underline}. Alfred argues, in both his
2005 and 2009 books, that any Indigenous engagement with the state,
including agreements and negotiations, is not only futile but
fundamentally dangerous, as such pathways do not directly challenge the
existing colonial structure and 'to argue on behalf of indigenous
nationhood within the dominant Western paradigm is self-defeating'.32
Alfred states that a 'notion of nationhood or self-government rooted in
state institutions and framed within the context of state sovereignty
can never satisfy the imperatives of Native American political
traditions'33 because the possibility for a true expression of
Indigenous self-determination is 'precluded by the state's insistence on
dominion and its exclusionary notion of sovereignty'.34 Worst of all,
according to Alfred, when Indigenous communities frame their struggles
in terms of asserting Aboriginal rights and title, but do so within a
state framework, rather than resisting the state itself, it 'represents
the culmination of white society's efforts to assimilate indigenous
peoples'.35 Because it is impossible to advance Indigenous
self-determination through any sort of engagement with the state,
Coulthard also advocates for an Indigenous resurgence paradigm that
follows both his mentor Taiaiake Alfred but also Anishinaabe feminist
theorist Leanne Simpson.36 As Coulthard writes, 'both Alfred and Simpson
start from a position that calls on Indigenous peoples and communities
to "turn away" from the assimilative reformism of the liberal
recognition approach and to instead build our national liberation
efforts on the revitalization of "traditional" political values and
practices'.37 Drawing upon the prescriptive approach of these theorists,
Coulthard proposes, in his concluding chapter, five theses from his
analysis that are intended to build and solidify Indigenous resurgence
into the future: 1. On the necessity of direct action, meaning that
physical forms of Indigenous resistance, like protest and blockades, are
very important not only as a reaction to the state but also as a means
of protecting the lands that are central to Indigenous peoples'
existence; 2. Capitalism, No More!, meaning the rejection of capitalist
forms of economic development in Indigenous communities in favour of
land-based Indigenous political-economic alternative approaches; 3.
Dispossession and Indigenous Sovereignty in the City, meaning the need
for Indigenous resurgence movements 'to address the interrelated systems
of dispossession that shape Indigenous peoples' experiences in both
urban and land-based settings'38; 4. Gender Justice and Decolonisation,
meaning that decolonisation must also include a shift away from
patriarchy and an embrace of gender relations that are non-violent and
refective of the centrality of women in traditional forms of Indigenous
governance and society; and 5. Beyond the Nation-State. While Coulthard
denies that he advocates complete rejection of engagement with the
state's political and legal system, he does assert that 'our efforts to
engage these discursive and institutional spaces to secure recognition
of our rights have not only failed, but have instead served to subtly
reproduce the forms of racist, sexist, economic, and political
confgurations of power that we initially sought...to challenge'.39 He
therefore advocates expressly for 'critical self-refection, skepticism,
and caution' in a 'resurgent politics of recognition that seeks to
practice decolonial, gender-emancipatory, and economically
nonexploitative alternative structures of law and sovereign authority
grounded on a critical refashioning of the best of Indigenous legal and
political traditions'.40 Corntassel also demonstrates the third
pessimism trap, that all engagement with the state is ultimately futile.
For the most part, however, Corntassel's observation is that the UN
system operates like a reverse Keck and Sikkink 'boomerang model' and
'channels the energies of transnational Indigenous networks into the
institutional fiefdoms of member countries', by which an 'illusion of
inclusion' is created.41 He argues that, in order to be included or
their views listened to, Indigenous delegates at the UN must mimic the
strategies, language, norms and modes of behaviour of member states and
international institutions. Corntassel fnds that 'what results is a
cadre of professionalized Indigenous delegates who demonstrate more
allegiance to the UN system than to their own communities'.42 In his
final analysis, he charges that the co-optation of international
Indigenous political actors is highly 'effective in challenging the
unity of the global Indigenous rights movement and hindering genuine
dialogue regarding Indigenous self-determination and justice'.43 Finding
that states deliberately co-opt and provide 'illusions of inclusion' to
Indigenous political actors in UN settings, Corntassel comes to the same
conclusion as Alfred concerning the futility of engagement, arguing that
because transnational Indigenous networks are 'channeled' and 'blunted'
by colonial state actors, 'it is a critical time for Indigenous peoples
to rethink their approaches to bringing Indigenous rights concerns to
global forums'.44 Imagining a Post-Colonial Future: Pessimistic
'Resurgence' Versus the Optimism and Tenacity of Indigenous Movements on
the Ground [All of these]{.underline} writers [advocate **Indigenous
resurgence**, through a combination of **rejecting**]{.underline} the
current reconciliation politics of [**settler colonial states**, coupled
with a **return to land-based Indigenous expressions** of governance as
the **only viable**, '**authentic**' and **legitimate path** to a better
future for Indigenous peoples, which they refer to as
**decolonisation**]{.underline}. While inherently critical in their
orientation, these three approaches do make some positive and productive
contributions to Indigenous movements. They help shed light on the
various and subtle ways that Indigenous leaders and communities can
become co-opted into a colonial system. They help us to hold leadership
accountable. They also help us keep a strong focus on our traditional,
cultural and spiritual values as well as our traditional forms of
governance which then also helps us imagine future possibilities. As I
have pointed out here, however, [all]{.underline} three theorists
[are]{.underline} also [**caught** in the]{.underline} same three
[**pessimism traps**: **authenticity versus co-option**; a vision of the
state as **unified**, **deliberate** and **never changing** in its
desire to **colonise** and **control**; and a view of engagement with
the state as **futile**, if not **dangerous**, to Indigenous sovereignty
and existence]{.underline}. When combined, [these]{.underline} three
pessimism [traps]{.underline} aim to [**inhibit Indigenous peoples'
engagement** with the state in **any process** that could potentially
**re-imagine** and **re-formulate** their current relationship into one
that could be **transformative** and **post-colonial**, as envisioned by
the **UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples**.
The]{.underline} pessimism [traps]{.underline} together work to
[**foreclose any possibility** that there could be **credible openings
of opportunity** to negotiate a **fairer** and **just relationship** of
co-existence with **even the most progressive state government**.
This]{.underline} pessimistic approach [is **not innocuous**. By
**overemphasising structure** and granting the state an **enormous
degree of agency** as a **unitary actor**, this]{.underline} pessimistic
approach [**does a remarkable disservice** to Indigenous resistance
movements by **proscribing**, from **academia**, an **extremely narrow
view** of what Indigenous self-determination **can** and **should mean**
in practice. By **overlooking** and/or **discounting Indigenous agency**
and **not even considering the possibility** that Indigenous peoples
**could themselves be calculating**, **strategic political actors** in
their own right, and vis-à-vis states, the pessimistic lens]{.underline}
of the resurgence school [**unnecessarily**, **unproductively** and
**unjustly limits the field of possibility** for Indigenous peoples'
decision-making, thus **actually countering** and **inhibiting
expressions of Indigenous self-determination**. By
**condemning**---**writ large**---**all Indigenous peoples** and
**organisations** that wish to **seek peaceful co-existence** with the
state, **negotiate mutually beneficial agreements** with the state,
and/or who have **advocated on the international level**
for]{.underline} a set of **[standards]{.underline}** that can provide a
positive guiding framework [for Indigenous-state relations, the
pessimistic lens]{.underline} of resurgence [**forecloses much potential
for new** and **improved relations**, in **any form**, and is **very
likely** to lead to **deeper conflicts** between states and Indigenous
peoples, and potentially, even **violent action**]{.underline}, which
Fanon indicated was the necessary outcome. [The pessimism
traps]{.underline} of the resurgence school [are therefore]{.underline},
likely [**self-defeating** for all but the **most remote** and
**isolated Indigenous communities**]{.underline}. Further, [this
approach is **quite out of step** with the **actions** and **vision of
many Indigenous resistance movements** on the ground who have been
**working for decades** to advance Indigenous self-determination, both
**domestically** and **globally**, in ways that **transform the colonial
state** into something **more just** and may eventually **present
creative alternatives** to the Westphalian state form in ways that could
**respect** and **accommodate Indigenous nations**]{.underline}. Rather,
[it aims to **shame** and **blame** those who wish to **explore
creative** and **innovative post-colonial resolutions** to the colonial
condition]{.underline}. [The **UN Declaration**]{.underline} on the
Rights of Indigenous Peoples (the Declaration or UN Declaration) was
adopted by the General Assembly in 2007 after 25 years of development.
The Declaration [is **ground-breaking**, given the **key leadership
roles** Indigenous peoples played in **negotiating** and **achieving**
this agreement]{.underline}.45 Additionally, for the first time in UN
history, the rights holders, [Indigenous peoples, **worked with states**
to develop an instrument that would serve to **promote**, **protect**
and **affirm Indigenous rights**, both **globally** and in **individual
domestic contexts**.]{.underline}46 [Many **Indigenous organisations**
and **movements**, from **dozens of countries** around the world, were
**involved in drafting** and **negotiating** the UN Declaration and are
now **advocating for its full implementation**, both **internationally**
and in **domestic** and **regional contexts**]{.underline}. In Canada,
some of the key organisational players---the Grand Council of the Crees
(Eeyou Istchee), the Assembly of First Nations, and the Union of British
Columbia Indian Chiefs, or their predecessor organisations---were
involved in the drafting and lengthy negotiations of the UN Declaration
during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. In the United States, organisations
like the American Indian Law Alliance and the Native American Rights
Fund have been involved as well as the Navajo Nation and the
Haudenosaunee Confederacy, who represent themselves as Indigenous
peoples' governing institutions. From Scandinavia, the Saami Council and
the Sami Parliaments all play a key role in advancing Indigenous rights.
In Latin America, organisations like the Confederación de Nationalidades
Indígenas del Ecuador (CONAIE) and the Consejo Indio de Sud America
(CISA) advocate for implementation of the UN Declaration. The three,
**[major transnational Indigenous organisations]{.underline}**--- the
World Council of Indigenous Peoples, the International Indian Treaty
Council and the Inuit Circumpolar Council---[were all **key members** of
the drafting and negotiating team for the UN Declaration,
and]{.underline} the latter two, which are still in existence,
[**continue their strong advocacy** for its full
implementation]{.underline}. Implementation of the UN Declaration on the
Rights of Indigenous Peoples requires fundamental and significant
change, on both the international and domestic levels. Because
implementation of Indigenous rights essentially calls for a complete and
fundamental restructuring of Indigenous-state relationships, it expects
states to enact and implement a signifcant body of legal,
constitutional, legislative and policy changes that can accommodate such
things as Indigenous land rights, free, prior and informed consent,
redress and a variety of self-government, autonomy and other such
arrangements. [States are **not going to implement** this multifaceted
and complex set of changes **on their own**]{.underline}, however. [They
will require **significant political** and **moral pressure to hold them
accountable** to the **rhetorical commitments** they have made to
support this level of change. They will also require **ongoing
conversation** and **negotiation** with Indigenous peoples along the
way, lest the process becomes **problematically one-sided**. Such
processes ultimately require **sustained political will**,
**commitment** and **engagement** over the **long term**, to
reach]{.underline} the end result of [**radical systemic change** and
Indigenous state relationships grounded in **mutual respect**,
**co-existence** and **reciprocity**. This type of fundamental change
requires **creative thinking**, **careful diplomacy**, **tenacity**,
and]{.underline} above all, [**optimistic vision**, on the part of
Indigenous peoples]{.underline}. The **[pessimistic
approaches]{.underline}** of the resurgence school [are]{.underline}
ultimately [of **little use**]{.underline} in these efforts, [other than
as a **cautionary tale** against state power, of which the
organisational players are **already keenly aware**]{.underline}.
Further, by [**dismissing** and **discouraging all efforts at
engagement** with states, and]{.underline} especially with [the
**blanket accusations** that all who engage in such efforts are
'**co-opted**' and not '**authentically**' Indigenous]{.underline}, the
resurgence school [actually creates **unnecessary negative feelings**
and **divisions** amongst Indigenous movements who should be **pooling
limited resources** and **working together towards better
futures**]{.underline}.

#### Calculative thinking and maximizing resources is inevitable and good

Moreover, **[we will not be saved by virtue]{.underline}**, [infinite
responsibility for the infinite other, or voluntarism]{.underline}.
[What we need is]{.underline} better abstractions, **[more calculative
thinking]{.underline}**, **[more en-framing]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[stronger institutional responses]{.underline}**. As
David Wood has shown, [when it comes to the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan, Katrina, global warming, and a variety of other events, it
has been the conservative response to embrace the impossibility of
calculative thought]{.underline}. [Perhaps our project going further
is]{.underline} to, as Isabelle Stengers has argued, **[to calculate
again]{.underline}**. [This is not the calculative thought of the
capitalist cost-benefit system, but a **different
calculation**]{.underline}. It is, to steal a phrase from Jane Bennett,
[about **mutually enabling instrumentalizations**]{.underline}. Long
quotation from Stengers ahead, so bear with me: The cosmopolitical
Parliament is not primarily a place where instantaneous decisions are
made, but a delocalized place. It exists every time a \"we\" is
constructed that does not identify with the identity of a solution but
hesitates before a problem. I associate this \"we\" with the only slogan
Leibniz ever proposed: Calculemus. [Let us calculate]{.underline}. It\'s
an odd expression, constructed to conceptualize the possibility of peace
during a time of war. But Leibniz was a mathematician, not an accountant
or statistician. For him, calculation was not a mere balance sheet
contrasting homogeneous quantities, calculations of interest or benefits
that were presented as being commensurable. For a mathematician, the
accuracy of a calculation and the validity of its result are relatively
simple questions, \"trivial\" in the language of mathematics. What is
important, and which is not in the least trivial, is the position of the
problem that will, possibly, allow it to be calculated, the precise
creation of relationships and constraints, the distinction between the
various ingredients, the exploration of the roles they are liable to
play, the determinations or indeterminations they engender or bring
about. There is no commensurability without the invention of a
measurement, and the challenge of Leibniz\'s calculemus is, precisely,
the creation of a \"we\" that excludes all external measures, all prior
agreements separating those who are entitled to \"enter\" into the
calculation and those subject to its result. \[\...\] Calculemus,
therefore, does not mean \"let us measure,\" \"let us add,\" \"let us
compare,\" but, first and foremost, let us create the \"we\" associated
with the nature and terms of the operation to be risked. It is not a
question of acting in the name of truth and justice, but of creating
commensurability. It is a question of knowing that the \"truth\" of the
created common measure will always be relative to what such creation
will have been capable of, knowing also that a radical heterogeneity
preexists such creation, the absence of any preexisting shared measure
among the ingredients to be articulated. (Cosmopolitics II, pp.
399-401).

#### Anticipating nuclear extinction [breeds empathy]{.underline} and [care]{.underline} -- distancing ourselves from considering extinction [reifies]{.underline} detached elitism

and Graduate Studies, Bentley Campus (Baden, "BEYOND OUR NUCLEAR
ENTANGLEMENT," Angelaki, 22:3, 17-25, dml) \[ableist language
modifications denoted by brackets\]

[You are steered towards **overwhelming** and **inexplicable pain** when
you consider the **nuclear entanglement** that the species]{.underline}
Homo sapiens [finds itself in]{.underline}. This is because [the fact of
living in the nuclear age presents an **existential**, **aesthetic**,
**ethical** and **psychological challenge** that defines human
consciousness. Although an **immanent threat** and **ever-present
danger** to the **very existence** of the human species, living with the
possibility of nuclear war has **infiltrated the matrix of modernity so
profoundly** as to]{.underline} paralyse [\[**shut down**\] our mind-set
to respond adequately. We have chosen to **ignore the facts** at the
heart of the nuclear program]{.underline} with its dangerous algorithm;
[we have chosen to **live with the capacity** and **possibility** of a
**collective**, **pervasive** and even **planetary-scale suicide**; and
the techno-industrial-national powers that claim there is "**no
immediate danger**" ad infinitum]{.underline}.8 This has led to one of
the key logics of modernity\'s insanity. As Harari writes: "Nuclear
weapons have turned war between superpowers into a mad act of collective
suicide, and therefore forced the most powerful nations on earth to find
alternative and peaceful ways to resolve conflicts."9 This is the
nuclear algorithm at work, a methodology of madness. In revisiting
Jacques Derrida in "No Apocalypse, Not Now (Full Speed Ahead, Seven
Missiles, Seven Missives),"10 who described nuclear war as a
"non-event," it is clear that the pathology of the "non-event" remains
as active as ever even in the time of Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un with
their stichomythic nuclear posturing. [The question of our times is
whether we have an **equal** or **more compelling capacity** and
**willingness** to **end this impoverished but ever-present logic** of
pain and uncertainty. How not simply to **bring about disarmament**, but
to **go beyond** this politically charged]{.underline}, as well as
mythological and psychological [**nuclear algorithm**?]{.underline} How
to find love amidst the nuclear entanglement; the antidote to this
entanglement? Is it possible to end the pathology of power that exists
with nuclear capacity? Sadly, the last lines of Nitin Sawhney\'s "Broken
Skin" underscore this entanglement: Just 5 miles from India\'s nuclear
test site Children play in the shade of the village water tank Here in
the Rajasthan desert people say They\'re proud their country showed
their nuclear capability.11 As an activist scholar working in the fields
of human rights and cultural studies, [responding to the nuclear
algorithm is an **imperative**. Your **politics**, **ethics** and
**scholarship are indivisible** in this cause. An **acute sense of care
for the world**, informed by **pacifist** and **non-violent**,
**de-colonialist approaches** to knowledge and practice, **pervades your
concern**. You are **aware** that there are **other ways of knowing**
than those you are familiar and credentialed with]{.underline}. You are
aware that you are complicit in the prisons that you choose to live
inside,12 and that there is no such thing as an innocent bystander. [You
use your scholarship to **shake up the world**]{.underline} from its
paralysis, abjection and amnesia; [to **unsettle the epistemic** and
**structural violence** that is ubiquitous to neoliberalism and its
machinery; to **create dialogic** and **learning spaces** for the work
of critical human rights and critical justice to take place. All this,
and to **enable an ethics of intervention** through understanding what
is at the very heart of the]{.underline} critical human rights
[impulse]{.underline}, creating a "dialogue for being, because I am not
without the other."13 Furthermore, as a critical human rights advocate
[living in a nuclear armed world, your challenge is to **reconceptualise
the human community**]{.underline} as Ashis Nandy has argued, [to see
how we can learn to **co-exist with others in conviviality** and also
learn to **co-survive with the non-human**, even to
**flourish**]{.underline}. A dialogue for being requires a leap into a
human rights frame that includes a deep ecological dimension, where [the
planet itself is **inherently involved as a participant** in its
future]{.underline}. This requires scholarship that "thinks like a
mountain."14 A critical human rights approach understands that it cannot
be simply human-centric. It requires a nuanced and arresting clarity to
present perspectives on co-existence and co-survival that are from human
and non-human viewpoints.15 Ultimately, [you realise that your struggle
is **not confined to**]{.underline} declarations, treaties,
[**legislation**, and **law**, **though they have their role**. It must
go further to produce "**creative intellectual exchange** that might
release **new ethical energies for mutually assured
survival**."]{.underline}16 [Taking an **anti-nuclear stance** and
**enabling a post-nuclear activism** demands a
**revolution**]{.underline} within the field of human rights work.
[Recognising the **entanglement of nuclearism**]{.underline} with the
Anthropocene, for one thing, [**requires a profound shift in focus**
from the **human-centric** to a **more-than-human
co-survival**.]{.underline} It also requires a fundamental shift in
understanding our human culture, in which the very epistemic and
rational acts of sundering from co-survival with the planet and
environment takes place. [In the end, you realise]{.underline}, as
Raimon Panikkar has articulated, ["it is not realistic to toil for peace
if we do not proceed to a disarmament of the bellicose culture in which
we live."]{.underline}17 Or, as Geshe Lhakdor suggests, there must be
"inner disarmament for external disarmament."18 In this sense, it is
within the cultural arena, our human society, where the entanglement of
subjective meaning making, nature and politics occurs, that we need to
disarm. It is 1982, and you are reading Jonathan Schell\'s The Fate of
the Earth on a Sydney bus. Sleeping has not been easy over the past few
nights as you reluctantly but compulsively read about the consequences
of nuclear war. For some critics, Schell\'s account is high polemic, but
for you it is more like Rabindranath Tagore: it expresses the suffering
we make for ourselves. What you find noteworthy is that although
Schell\'s scenario of widespread destruction of the planet through
nuclear weaponry, of immeasurable harm to the bio-sphere through
radiation, is powerfully laid out, the horror and scale of nuclear
obliteration also seems surreal and far away as the bus makes its way
through the suburban streets. A few years later, you read a statement
from an interview with Paul Tibbets, the pilot of "Enola Gay," the plane
that bombed Hiroshima. He says, "The morality of dropping that bomb was
not my business."19 This abstraction from moral responsibility -- the
denial of the implications on human life and the consequences of
engagement through the machinery of war -- together with the sweeping
amnesia that came afterwards from thinking about the bombing of
Hiroshima, are what make you become an environmental and human rights
activist. You realise that [what **makes the nuclear algorithm work**
involves a politically engineered and deeply embedded insecurity-based
recipe to **elide the nuclear threat from everyday life**. The spectre
of nuclear obliteration]{.underline}, like the idea of human rights,
[can appear **abstract** and **distant**, **not our everyday
business**]{.underline}. You realise that [within this recipe is the
creation of a **moral tyranny of distance**, an abnegation of myself
with the other. One of modernity\'s greatest and earliest achievements
was the mediation of the self with the world. How this became a project
assisted and shaped through the
military-industrial-technological-capitalist complex is fraught and hard
to untangle. But as a critical]{.underline} human rights [scholar you
have come to **see through that complex**, and you put energies into
**challenging that tyranny of distance**, to activate a **politics**,
**ethics** and **scholarship that recognises the other as integral to
yourself**]{.underline}. Ultimately, even, to see that the other is also
within.20

#### Nuclear fear is [compatible]{.underline} with avowing the [everyday]{.underline} apocalypse \-- BUT \-- assessing the world [before]{.underline} a nuclear strike as [no different]{.underline} than a world [after]{.underline} one is whitewashing. 

**Thompson '18** \[Nicole; April 4th; Creative Writer; RaceBaitR, "Why I
will not allow the fear of a nuclear attack to be white-washed,"
https://racebaitr.com/2018/04/06/2087/\]

I couldn't spare empathy for a white woman whose biggest fear was
something that hadn't happened yet and might not. Meanwhile, [my most
**significant fears** were]{.underline} in motion: women and men [dying
in **cells** after being **wrongly imprisoned**]{.underline}, choked out
for peddling cigarettes, [or **shot to death**]{.underline} during
'routine' traffic stops. I twitch when my partner is late, worried that
a cantankerous cop has brutalized or shot him because he wouldn't
prostrate himself.

[As a **woman of color**]{.underline}, I am aware of the [multiple types
of violence that threaten me **currently**---not **theoretically**.
Street harassment]{.underline}, excessively affecting me as a Black
woman, has blindsided me since I was eleven. A premature body
[meant]{.underline} being catcalled before I'd discussed the birds and
the bees. It meant being followed, whistled at, or groped. As an adult,
while navigating through neighborhoods with extinguished street lights,
I noticed the correlation between women's safety and street
lighting---as well as the fact that Black and brown neighborhoods were
never as brightly lit as those with a more significant white population.

I move quickly through those unlit spaces, never comforted by the
inevitable whirl of red and blue sirens. In fact, it's always been the
contrary. Ever so often, cops approach me in their vehicle's encouraging
me to "Hurry along," "Stay on the sidewalk," or "Have a good night." My
spine stiffening, I never believed they endorsed my safety. Instead, I
worried that I'd be accused of an unnamed accusation, corned by a cop
who preys on Black women, or worse. A majority of my 50-minute bus ride
from the southside of Chicago to the north to join these women for the
birthday celebration was spent reading articles about citywide
shootings. I began with a Chicago Tribute piece titled "33 people shot,
seven fatally, in 13 hours," then toppled into a barrage of RIP posts on
Facebook and ended with angry posts about police brutality on Tumblr.
You might guess, by the time I arrived to dinner I wasn't in the mood
for the "I can't believe we're all going to die because Trump is an
idiot" shit.

I shook my head, willing the meal to be over, and was grateful when the
check arrived just as someone was asking me about my hair. My thinking
wasn't all too different from Michael Harriot's 'Why Black America Isn't
Worried About the Upcoming Nuclear Holocaust." While the meal was partly
pleasant, I departed [thinking, "fear of **nuclear demolition** is just
**some white shit**]{.underline}."

Sadly, that thought would not last long.

I still vibe with Harriot's statement, "Black people have lived under
the specter of having our existence erased on a white man's whim since
we stepped onto the shore at Jamestown Landing." [However]{.underline},
a friend---a Black friend---ignited my nuclear paranoia by sharing
theories about when it might happen and who faced the greatest threat.
In an attempt to ease my friend's fear, I leaned in to listen but
accidentally toppled down the rabbit hole too. I forked through curated
news feeds. I sifted through "fake news," "actual news," and foreign
news sources. Suddenly, an idea took root: [**nuclear strike**
would]{.underline} [**disproportionately** impact **Black people**,
**brown people**, and **low-income individuals**]{.underline}.

North Korea won't target the plain sight racists of Portland, Oregon,
the violently microaggressive liberals of the rural Northwest, or the
white-hooded klansmen of Diamondhead, Mississippi. No, under the
instruction of the supreme leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea will likely
strike densely populated urban areas, such as Los Angeles, Chicago,
Washington D.C., and New York City. These locations stand-out as targets
for a nuclear strike because they are densely populated U.S. population
centers. [Attacking]{.underline} the heart of the nation or **[populous
cities]{.underline}** [would translate to **more
casualties**]{.underline}. With that in mind, it's not lost on me that
the most [**populous cities** in the **U**nited **S**tates boast
sizeable]{.underline} diverse populations, or more plainly put: **[Black
populations]{.underline}**. This stresses me out! There's a creeping
chill that follows me, a silent alarm that rings each time my Google
alert chimes letting me know that Donald Trump has yet again provoked
Kim Jong-Un, a man who allegedly killed his very own uncle. I've grown
so pressed by the idea of nuclear holocaust that my partner and I
started gathering non-perishables, candlesticks, a hand-crank radio, and
other must-buy items that can be banked in a shopping cart. The practice
of preparing for a nuclear holocaust strike sometimes feels comical,
particularly when acknowledging that there has long been a war on Black
people in this country.

Blackness is bittersweet in flavor. We are blessed with the melanized
skin, the MacGyver-like inventiveness of our foremothers, and our
blinding brightness---but the anti-blackness that we experience is also
blinding as well as stifling. We are stuck by rigged systems, punished
with the prison industrial complex, housing discrimination, pay
discrimination, and worse. We get side-eyes from strangers when we're
"loitering," and the police will pull us over for driving "too fast" in
a residential neighborhood. We get murdered for holding cell phones
while standing in our grandmother's backyard.

The racism that strung up our ancestors, kept them sequestered to the
back of the bus and kept them in separate and unequal schools still
lives. It lives, and it's more palpable than dormant. To me, this means
one thing: Trump's America isn't an unfortunate circumstance, it's a
homecoming event that's hundreds of years in the making, no matter how
many times my white friends' say, "He's not my president."

In light of this homecoming, [we **now flirt** with a **new, larger**
fear]{.underline} of a [**Black genocide**. America has **always
worked** towards **Black eradication** through]{.underline} a steady
stream of [**life-threatening inequality**, but **nuclear
war**]{.underline} on American soil would be **[swift]{.underline}**.
And for this reason I've grown tired of whiteness being at the center of
the nuclear conversation. The race-neutral approach to the dialogue, and
a tendency to continue to promote the idea that missiles will land in
suburban and rural backyards, instead of inner-city playgrounds, is
false.

"The Day After," the iconic, highest-rated television film in history,
aired November 20, 1983. More than 100 million people tuned in to watch
a film postulating a war between the Soviet Union and the United States.
The film, which would go on to affect President Ronald Reagan and
policymakers' nuclear intentions, shows the "true effects of nuclear war
on average American citizens." The Soviet-targeted areas featured in the
film include Higginsville, Kansas City, Sedalia, Missouri, as well as El
Dorado Springs, Missouri. They depict the destruction of the central
United States, and viewers watch as full-scale nuclear war transforms
middle America into a burned wasteland. Yet unsurprisingly, the
[devastation]{.underline} from the attack [is **completely
white-washed**]{.underline}, leaving out the more likely victims which
are the more densely populated (Black) areas.

**[Death tolls]{.underline}** would be high for white populations, yes,
but large-scale losses of Black and brown folks would outpace that
number, due to placement and poverty. That number [would be **pushed
higher** by **limited access** to]{.underline} premium **[health
care]{.underline}**, wealth, and resources. The [effects of **radiation
sickness**]{.underline}, burns, compounded injuries, and malnutrition
would throttle Black and brown communities and [would **mark us** for
**generations**]{.underline}. It's for that reason that we have to do
more to foster disaster preparedness among Black people where we can.
[**Black people** deserve the space to explore **nuclear unease**, even
if we have **competing threats**]{.underline}, anxieties, and worries.

#### 

#### The alt can't solve states [going to war]{.underline} AND makes [alleviating]{.underline} "concrete human woes" [irrelevant]{.underline}. They have no feasible way to solve miscalculation. 

**Isacoff '15** \[Jonathan; 2015; Associate Professor of Political
Science and the Chair of Environmental Studies at Gonzaga
University; *Why IR Needs Deweyan Pragmatism*, "Perspectives on
Political Science," p. 26-33; GR\]

I mean that [what **IR is or is not** is not **nearly as important** as
what it **achieves**]{.underline}. So the question should not be whether
IR is scientific, but rather, how scientific does it need to be to get
the job done? To this, there are many answers, but I suggest a line of
reasoning: the scientific method in the most general sense is useful in
helping to explain how and why, all else equal, causal processes work.
Put differently, [if we want to know **how and why** some states **go to
war**]{.underline} and others do not, [it would be **more
useful**]{.underline}---[in the sense of getting **logically coherent**,
**empirically verifiable** answers---to analyze **historical cases
systematically**]{.underline} than it would be to consult with a shaman
or use a crystal ball to obtain an answer. This is not say that there is
not an important role for textual interpretation in the process of
studying war and other international phenomena. Indeed, I elsewhere
argue that interpretation of historical texts is crucial to making valid
claims about wars.47 But the main point here is that interpretation is a
means toward an end, namely, the process of coping with the world via
human experience. Toward that end, interpretation is necessary and
useful, but it is not the end itself.

A second point is that there is clearly a pragmatic and justifiable need
for certain types of quantitative methods, namely, statistics, though
not necessarily formal models, in some segments of IR. Taking a simple
example for illustrative purposes, if one wished to study the effect of
speed limits on motor vehicle fatalities, the use of aggregate data
statistically analyzed would be far superior to standing on the corner
waiting for an accident to observe or reading several diary accounts of
individual accidents. The key point here, however, is not that
statistical methods are inherently better, or more "rigorous" than any
other type of method. Rather, [the use of **statistically analyzed
data** to find answers to problems]{.underline} of highway fatalities
[creates **knowledge** that]{.underline} if properly applied, [**would
alleviate** "concrete **human woes,"** which is to say it would help to
save lives. That is **pragmatic political science**]{.underline}.

48 What Is a Problem?

Many political scientists believe in the idea of having a "problem
orientation" for the field. For example, Atul Kohli asserts that there
is a strong consensus among leading experts "that comparative politics
is very much a problem-driven field of study." "What motivates the best
comparative politics research are puzzles of real-world significance,"
writes Kohli, in "The Role of Theory in Comparative Politics: A
Symposium."49 Similarly, Ian Shapiro, responding to the question of what
would be a better alternative than RCT asks the question: "What is the
phenomenon to be explained?... The formulation of alternative
explanations, in other words, should be a problem-driven activity."50
This is clearly consistent with Deweyan pragmatism; in fact, it is
inherently pragmatist. "A Deweyan pragmatic approach to political
inquiry," writes Maurice Meilleur, "would transform political science
from a discipline, based on a set of methods, into a profession, based
on a set of problems."51 But what, more specifically, is a "problem
orientation?" First, it is clear that Kohli and his colleagues mean an
empirically driven problem orientation. That is, the study of [politics
should be driven by **empirical**, **not theoretical**, or
**methodological problems**]{.underline}. Careful not to push this point
too far, a Deweyan pragmatist would suggest that theorization is an
important activity, but it must not lose its link to problems of human
experience, which is to say empirical problems. However, Kohli and
others advocating an empirically driven problem orientation have little
to say about how to identify and value problems. After all, there is a
limitless supply of political problems only a fraction of which can be
studied.

In response, I would argue that some problems are more significant to
the detection and response to human suffering and thus more deserving of
study, than others. This is itself a tricky ethical problem, for who is
to say what is or is not a "real problem?" One reader of this manuscript
suggested that "What is really going on here, when one scratches the
analytical surface, is not that IR theorists aren\'t discussing
problems; it\'s that they are discussing problems that the author does
not feel are worthy of attention. But why should we accept that the
author\'s "problems" are more important or privileged? Why does the
author get to decide what a "real" problem is?" This is a good question
but it is a misreading of the argument. Nowhere does Dewey or this
author imply that any individual could or should decide or dictate which
problems matter and which do not. To the contrary, the question of "who
decides" is a public deliberation problem, a subject Dewey addressed
exhaustively in his classic The Public and Its Problems.52 According to
Dewey, problems are the direct outcome of a public\'s determination of
its common good. A full analysis of how this works, or in some cases,
fails to work in practice is beyond the scope of this article. But it is
important to note that there is no argument here for the privileging of
one private individual\'s notion of what constitutions "real problem"
versus that of another. That is for the public to decide.

Human Woe and Issues That Matter

The final point to be made about reconstruction stems directly from the
previous discussion: some problems matter more than others with regard
to the alleviation of concrete human suffering. Which issues matter the
most in our world? Ultimately, per Dewey\'s political philosophy touched
on above, that is for the public to decide. Assuming that there ever
could be a "common good," we can hypothesize that [people might
**choose** to **focus on** issues]{.underline} that affect them daily,
issues [such as **climate change**, **poverty**]{.underline}, health
care, education, [**racism**, and **sexism**]{.underline}, as well as
**[war and peace]{.underline}**, all [issues that are of **grave
importance** to **humanity**]{.underline}. IR, especially in its
American form, with its disproportionate emphasis on global security and
great power war, has given scant attention to too many other issues, and
when attention is given to the "lesser" topics, they are relegated to
sub-sub-specializations within the discipline, "Gender and IR," for
instance. More **[problematic]{.underline}** from the standpoint of
pragmatism, [the **approach-driven wing**]{.underline} of the discipline
[is **more concerned** with which **paradigm** has scored **more
points** in the **epic contest** for **paradigmatic supremacy** than
with]{.underline} the matter of [how the world **could or should**
respond]{.underline} to climate change or why hundreds of million of
children lack basic nutrition and medical care. The
interpretivist/linguistic wing, in contrast, is more concerned with how
texts are interpreted in graduate seminars than with the fact that
children in inner cities cannot even read a text at all.

53 [Many]{.underline} IR scholars are still fighting over whether and to
what extent "unit-level variables" should be taken into consideration in
understanding international politics (and if so, whether one might still
rightly be accepted in the club of realism).54 Others [are **trying** to
demonstrate that IR]{.underline} constructivism [is really "**liberalism
in disguise**]{.underline}."55 [This is]{.underline} not a stab at "why
realism is (yet again) wrong." It is [a critique of the
**self-definitionally obsessed**, paradigm-driven culture]{.underline}
of academic IR. I would not go so far as to claim that there are no
scholars who study everyday politics; many clearly do.56 Rather, [the
problem is that]{.underline} that the incentive structure to contribute
to the "big debates" of the discipline, namely, those at [the
paradigmatic level]{.underline}, is a [project that drifts **ever afar**
from the problems of "**concrete human woe**" that affect the **other
millions of people** who happen not to have **graduate degrees in
IR**]{.underline}.

#### No root cause of war and they can't solve it \-\-- their "intervention" impact can't explain why Western intervention happened in Libya and Iraq but not in Yemen \-\-- prefer grounded historical analysis 

Benno Gerhard **Teschke 11**, IR prof at the University of Sussex,
"Fatal attraction: a critique of Carl Schmitt\'s international political
and legal theory", International Theory (2011), 3 : pp 179-227

For at the centre of the heterodox -- partly post-structuralist, partly
realist -- neo-Schmittian analysis stands the conclusion of The Nomos:
the thesis of a structural and continuous relation between liberalism
and violence (Mouffe 2005, 2007; Odysseos 2007). It suggests that, in
sharp contrast to the liberal-cosmopolitan programme of 'perpetual
peace', the geographical expansion of liberal modernity was accompanied
by the intensification and de-formalization of war in the international
construction of liberal-constitutional states of law and the production
of liberal subjectivities as rights-bearing individuals. [Liberal
world-ordering proceeds via the conduit of wars for
humanity]{.underline}, leading to Schmitt\'s 'spaceless universalism'.
In this perspective, [**a straight line is drawn from WWI to the War on
Terror to verify Schmitt\'s long-term prognostic** of the 20th century
as the age of 'neutralizations and de-politicizations']{.underline}
(Schmitt 1993). **[But this attempt to read the history of 20th century
international relations in terms of a succession of confrontations
between the carrier-nations of liberal modernity and the criminalized
foes at its outer margins seems unable to comprehend the complexities
and specificities of 'liberal' world-ordering, then and
now]{.underline}**. [For in the cases of Wilhelmine, Weimar and fascist
Germany]{.underline}, the assumption that their conflicts with the
Anglo-American liberal-capitalist heartland were grounded in an
[antagonism]{.underline} [between liberal modernity]{.underline} [and a
recalcitrant Germany outside its geographical and conceptual
lines]{.underline} [runs counter to the historical
evidence]{.underline}. For this reading presupposes that late-Wilhelmine
Germany was not already substantially penetrated by capitalism and fully
incorporated into the capitalist world economy, posing the question of
whether the causes of WWI lay in the capitalist dynamics of
inter-imperial rivalry (Blackbourn and Eley 1984), or in processes of
belated and incomplete liberal-capitalist development, due to the
survival of 're-feudalized' elites in the German state classes and the
marriage between 'rye and iron' (Wehler 1997). It also assumes that the
late-Weimar and early Nazi turn towards the construction of an autarchic
German regionalism -- Mitteleuropa or Großraum -- was not deeply
influenced by the international ramifications of the 1929 Great
Depression, but premised on a purely political--existentialist assertion
of German national identity. Against a reading of the early 20th century
conflicts between 'the liberal West' and Germany as 'wars for humanity'
between an expanding liberal modernity and its political exterior, there
is more evidence to suggest that these [confrontations were interstate
conflicts within the crisis-ridden and nationally uneven capitalist
project of modernity]{.underline}. Similar objections and caveats to the
binary opposition between the Western discourse of liberal humanity
against non-liberal foes apply to the more recent period. [For how can
this optic explain that **the 'liberal West' coexisted**]{.underline}
(and keeps coexisting) [**with a large number of** pliant
**authoritarian client-regimes**]{.underline} (Mubarak\'s
[Egypt]{.underline}, Suharto\'s Indonesia, Pahlavi\'s Iran, Fahd\'s
[Saudi-Arabia, even]{.underline} Gaddafi\'s pre-intervention
[Libya]{.underline}, to name but a few), [**which** were and **are
actively managed** and supported by the West **as anti-liberal**
Schmittian **states of emergency**, with concerns for liberal
subjectivities and Human Rights secondary to the strategic interests of
political and geopolitical stability and economic access]{.underline}?
Even in the more obvious cases of Afghanistan, Iraq, and, now, Libya,
[the idea that Western intervention has to be conceived as an encounter
between the liberal project and a series of foes outside its sphere
seems to rely on a denial of their antecedent histories as
geopolitically and socially contested state-building
projects]{.underline} in pro-Western fashion, deeply co-determined by
long histories of Western anti-liberal colonial and post-colonial
legacies. If these states (or social forces within them) turn against
their imperial masters, the conventional policy expression is
'blowback'. [And as]{.underline} [**the Schmittian analytical
vocabulary** does not include a conception of human agency and social
forces -- only friend/enemy groupings and collective political entities
governed by executive decision -- **it**]{.underline} [also **lacks the
categories of analysis to comprehend** the social dynamics that drive
the **struggles around sovereign power and the eventual
overcoming**]{.underline}, for example, **[of Tunisian and Egyptian
states of emergency without US-led wars for humanity]{.underline}**.
Similarly, [it seems unlikely that the generic idea of liberal
world-ordering and the production of liberal subjectivities can actually
explain why Western intervention seems improbable in some
cases]{.underline} (e.g. Bahrain, Qatar, [Yemen]{.underline} or Syria)
[and more likely in others]{.underline} (e.g. Serbia, **[Afghanistan,
Iraq]{.underline}**, [and Libya]{.underline}). Liberal world-ordering
consists of differential strategies of building, coordinating, and
drawing liberal and anti-liberal states into the Western orbit, and
overtly or covertly intervening and refashioning them once they step out
of line. [These are conflicts within a world, which seem to push the
term liberalism beyond its original meaning. The generic Schmittian idea
of a liberal 'spaceless universalism' sits uncomfortably with the
realities of maintaining an America-supervised 'informal empire',
**which has to manage a persisting interstate system in diverse and
case-specific ways**]{.underline}. But it is this persistence of a
worldwide system of states, which encase national particularities, which
renders challenges to American supremacy possible in the first place.

Racism is a powerful, malignant force in world politics, and our
discipline, IR, has deeply problematic entanglements with it. It is a
serious matter both to come intellectually to grips with this and to
find the most effective strategies to act on it. [We worry
that]{.underline} [more serious **problems**]{.underline} [and
**possibilities** are **marginalised**]{.underline} [by an ultimately
very **inward-looking** and **scholastic exercise**]{.underline} [where
a particular definition of racism and]{.underline} a specific
[theoretical perspective makes it possible to deem the vast majority of
scholarship in IR 'racist', 'methodologically white' and 'antiblack'-
every work that does not explicitly follow one exact version of
anti-racist scholarship]{.underline}. Especially, [the role
played]{.underline} in H&RM's argumentation [by]{.underline} our **[sins
of omission]{.underline}** [does]{.underline} ultimately seem to [rest
on the premise that **only** their **distinct form**]{.underline} [of
scholarship can be redeemed]{.underline}, because even post-colonial
scholarship and critiques of euro-centrism are not enough; [you are a
racist if you do not follow exactly this particular route]{.underline}.
It is not important whether your scholarship actually supports or
hinders anti-racist analysis or political engagement; [it is all about
**who you cite**]{.underline} [and what **declarations you
make**]{.underline}. **[Here]{.underline}**, [a theory is not judged by
**what can be done with it**]{.underline}, [but by the question whether
**self-appointed anti-racists** can find **supposedly problematic
sentences** somewhere in its key texts]{.underline}. In this section, we
will first point out that the H&RM article is a personal attack on us
for racism, despite their reassurances about the opposite. Then, we
discuss what an analysis of structural racism (systems of power) could
amount to, given that they claim to do one but utterly fail to do so,
resorting instead to a pretend examination of the foundations of ST.
Next, we discuss what could be methodological guidelines for actually
proving whether or not a theory like ST is racist.

[H&RM's usage of the term racism for all scholarship that does not
foreground race as the primary theme, means that **99% of IR will be
'racist'**]{.underline}. [There will be **no room** for any other
scholarship]{.underline} (unless you will live with the moniker of being
racist). [Not only does this seem **very unproductive**]{.underline} [in
terms of disciplinary conversations, not to talk of **diversity** and
**pluralism**, it]{.underline} also [means that it becomes **very hard**
to use the category of 'racism' for **critical purposes**]{.underline}
[for those cases where it **actually is at stake**]{.underline} in a
sense closer to what the rest of the discipline, and indeed the public
discourse, means by it. [It has been **watered down**]{.underline} [by
the fact that everyone but those in critical whiteness studies have been
deemed racist]{.underline}, one by one, where we just happened to get
the special honour of being among the first. [H&RM might protest that
this is not their plan, but we **fail to see how this can be
avoided**]{.underline} [when the logic they apply is that the term
racist can be based primarily on **sins of omission**]{.underline} [in
the sense of a theory being focused around other
categories]{.underline}.

As documented above, they claim numerous times that ST 'occludes' or
'refuses' various dynamics relating to race that they find important,
but they never offer any basis for concluding that the theory makes it
harder to see these things, only that it does not as such zoom in on
them. This does not have to do with a choice particularly regarding race
but the structure and nature of the theory as a general analytical
apparatus that can be applied to all instances where actors try to
securitize or desecuritize something, and the user is free then to
include race more or less in this analysis, just as the theory is not
deciding how important nationalism is or gender51, but it enables the
analysis of the way different categories and distinctions become
politically mobilised in security struggles.

[H&RM will probably argue that if you do not mention race in these
contexts, you '**hide' it**]{.underline}. **[Three
answers]{.underline}**: [1) **no**, there is a difference between **not
mentioning** and **hiding**, it takes a step more of the critic to show
that the theory **prevents** something from being
articulated]{.underline} or that it uses abstractions that stand in the
way of articulating race; that certainly is the case for some theories,
so it is a legitimate avenue of critique, but they haven't shown this,
[2) the theory is **intentionally**]{.underline} (as we have explained
numerous times) **[minimalist]{.underline}** in having a clear
conceptual core and then [not putting all kinds of factors like the role
of media or populism into the theory \-- **not** because we haven't
noticed these factors but because they **belong in applications**, and
the theory exactly allows you to study these phenomena, 3) we
are]{.underline} very [explicit that one of the **advantages of a
minimalist theory**]{.underline} [is the ability to **combine it** with
other theories]{.underline} especially general theories [about the
nature and structures of society]{.underline}; one should not build out
ST to become a general theory of society or international relations,
better in any specific usage of the theory combine it with the theories
one finds productive for the particular research project. (Wæver 2011,
2015) The latter point has come up in replies to the 'sociological'
version of ST (Balzacq), which has more of a tendency to add all
relevant factors to the theory, while the classical Copenhagen version
is tight and invites combination with theories that complement it, which
could exactly be theories of race and racism. Our ultimate concern here
is: how do we actually get to study racism in world politics in a
practically and politically helpful way?

When developing our own framework, ST, [we took **care**]{.underline}
[to make sure it could do critical work in concrete analyses, in our
view on racism as well]{.underline}, and H&RM fail to show that this is
not the case. In addition, we have then on a more mundane, human level
engaged ourselves in various ways to foster non-Western scholarship and
theories in IR (Tickner & Wæver 2009; Acharya & Buzan 2010, 2019). One
has for instance co-founded a book-series with the aim to identify
"alternatives for thinking about the 'international' that are more in
tune with local concerns and traditions outside the West" and
"provincializing the West" (quoting from the Routledge homepage of the
book series); the other has amongst many other things re-written this
history of the IR discipline to show both that it has ignored
non-Western contributions and that the Western part of it is indebted to
'scientific racism' (Buzan & Lawson 2015; Acharya and Buzan 2019).
Closer to ST, the project in Buzan & Wæver 2003 was to a large extent to
challenge the euro-centrism enshrined in dominant conceptions of
polarity and of the relationship between global and regional, to enable
theories to be more attentive to actual security dynamics in 'most of
the world'.

Surely, all of these efforts can be critically assessed as to what has
been helpful and what hasn't. But we find it strange that H&RM choose to
ignore completely the possibility of assessing the ability of ST to form
the basis for helpful analyses of racism. They neither look at those
analyses that have actually been done, nor do they show systematically
why it would be impossible to do so. On the contrary, [they limit
themselves to highly abstract and indirect attributions of racism to the
theory as such through various unconvincing routes]{.underline}. From
this they deduce (without any discussion) that ST can't inform studies
of racism (and when it has actually done it, they presumably are able to
magically make those publications go away) (see section 6 below).

[H&RM offer **no explanation**]{.underline} [as to how their type of
analysis helps in combating racism]{.underline}. [It is
**unclear**]{.underline} [if it is a kind of **ground clearing
operation**]{.underline} [to be followed up by new and better theories
after getting us out of the way]{.underline}. [Or whether they believe
that we are so much a part of the oppressive structures that attacking
us is in itself liberating]{.underline}. Or \-- as we will consider
below in more detail \-- the whole exercise is more about making
universities more inclusive and hospitable to students and scholars of
colour. Closely linked to the latter option, [their rationale could be
that the attack is meant more as a kind of 'happening' drawing attention
to the question of race]{.underline}. [Especially in the latter case, it
would be intentional that the article plays ambiguously with making a
very personal attack while pretending not to]{.underline}.

**Negating war reps is [good]{.underline} for black political
mobilization.**

Michael C. **Dawson 13**, the John D. MacArthur Professor of Political
Science and the College at the University of Chicago, 7/7/13, "What's
next for the black left?,"
<http://www.salon.com/2013/07/07/whats_next_for_the_black_left/>

[When we start]{.underline} the process of [imagining new worlds, "we
must]{.underline} tell no lies, [claim no easy victories]{.underline},"
as Amilcar Cabral succinctly put it. We must understand the conditions
from which we must build. [Even though much of modern public policy
appears raceless, the black community is under severe attack as a result
of the neoliberal political agenda. The Tea Party's devastating attack
on public sector unions is]{.underline}, for example, [greatly
increasing the amount of poverty and misery in American black
communities]{.underline}. Steven Pitts demonstrated that public sector
employment remains the foundation for black employment that it has been
since before World War II. Consequently, [an attack on public sector
employment is an attack on the black community]{.underline}: "The public
sector is the largest employer of Black workers; there is a greater
likelihood that a Black Worker will be employed by in the public sector
compared to a non-Black worker; wages earned by blacks in that industry
are higher than those earned by Blacks in other sectors; and inequality
within an industry is less in the public sector compared to other
industries".

Workers of all races and ethnicities are facing hard times during yet
another jobless "recovery," and [building political unity]{.underline}
among them [is still a daunting task]{.underline}. Lani Guinier argued
that the burdens of integration were distributed unfairly among the poor
and working people of the country, thus further under- mining the basis
for bringing those at the bottom together across racial lines. Building
interracial unity was always more difficult than liberals (and in
particular white leftists) imagined it would be, since white workers had
an investment in whiteness that often led them to privilege race over
class when making decisions about political alliances. Any new
rebuilding of interracial unity has to confront how to change the white
working class's (and, to the degree possible, the white middle class's)
perceptions so that they see it as in their interest to ally with
nonwhite Americans.

These are just two examples of the very large obstacles that must be
overcome by any utopian project. [We need a pragmatic
utopianism]{.underline}---one [that starts where we are, but imagines
where we want to be. Pragmatic utopianism is not new to black
radicalism]{.underline}. King's work, and that of the civil rights
movement more generally, was based on the utopian imagining of a much
different America---one they were repeatedly told was impossible to
obtain---combined with the hardheaded political realism that generated
the strategies and tactics necessary to achieve their goals. Indeed, [it
was the combination of utopian imagining of a better world and political
realism that led King to Memphis in support of black sanitation
workers]{.underline}. The Memphis campaign, and even more so the Poor
People's Campaign that he was about to launch, was designed to
explicitly take on what Mosley called the "voracious maw of capitalism"
in order to achieve economic justice for all, and in the process build
the interracial unity that Guinier correctly observed has been difficult
to achieve.

Dreams of a New Society?

I am no longer twenty, so I no longer know everything about how the
world should be. I myself do not have anywhere near a developed utopian
vision. What I do have are a few tentative suggestions about what I see
as necessary to get the discussion started. My suggestions are not
listed in order of priority, and this list is not exhaustive. As Mosley
notes, we must all develop our own lists, share them, and argue in
public about them.

1\. Barbara Ehrenreich's and Derrick Muhammad's work on the racial
realities of the economic crisis and white racial resentment reinforce
the need for a conversation on the left about how to openly discuss race
in such a way that Americans have to both confront the facts of race in
this country and listen to each other so that they begin to understand
their real interests.7 Otherwise white resentment will continue to be
aimed at the wrong people (different types of white resentment have
different targets). We will have to counter Fox News and its allies. We
still have Glenn Beck shouting to a very large and receptive audience
that universal programs such as health care are actually "stealth
reparations" because they disproportionately affect people of color.

Why can we not have a truth and reconciliation discussion here? In South
Africa, truth telling was transformative of both society and
individuals. [Progressive change necessitates a psychological
transformation as well as a societal one]{.underline}. While Meister
argues that in South Africa the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
became a substitute for success---it symbolized satisfaction with the
democratic victory rather than full economic emancipation and full
defeat of settler colonialism---he points out that if one looks to
Gandhi, then one realizes that reconciliation, relent- less political
struggle for justice, and eventual victory need not be incompatible.
Dialogue and eventual reconciliation would be steps along the way the
road to full victory, not full victory itself.

Political theorist Wendy Brown was skeptical of claims of reparations,
apologies, and calls for remembrance and reconciliation, basing her
point of view on a critique of identity politics very different from the
one found in Rorty, Gitlin, and Brubaker and Cooper. Brown argued that
identity politics is a form of politics based on weakness and thus has
limited possibilities for generating progressive change. Its investment
in the past and in suffering all but forecloses the chance that such a
movement could become the basis for a democratic future:

What are the particular constituents---specific to our time yet roughly
generic for a diverse spectrum of identities---of identity's desire for
recognition that seem often to breed a politics of recrimination and
rancor, of culturally dispersed paralysis and suffering, a tendency to
reproach power rather than aspire to it, to disdain freedom rather than
practice it? In short, where do the historically and culturally specific
elements of politicized identity's investments in itself, and especially
in its own history of suffering come into conflict with the need to give
up these investments, to engage in something of a Nietzschean
"forgetting" of this history, in the pursuit of an emancipatory
democratic project?

She added that "politicized identity" leads to, as Nietzsche predicted,
"impotence . . . incapacity, powerlessness, and rejection." Identity,
according to this view, becomes a substitute for action, though Brown
agreed that these characteristics do not describe the civil rights
movement . She was skeptical about the current reparations movement,
which she saw as based on weakness, rancor, and perhaps a sense of
impotence, and she worried, "Once guilt is established and a measure of
victimization secured by an apology or by material compensation, is the
historical event presumed to be concluded, sealed as past, 'healed,' or
brought to 'closure'?"

The current reparations movement need not be based on a politics of
rancor (although it has generated plenty of rancor on the part of those
who feel their privilege and comfort threatened). Redistributive justice
and political power are at the center of the demands this movement has
advanced, as is the desire for freedom. Reparations are not about the
triumph of the weak; rather, they are a demand for a conversation about
justice and the way that racial oppression in the past is linked to
black disadvantage today and to the continued existence of an unjust
racial order. Indeed, the demand for reparations is frequently
associated with the demand for self-determination. Self-determination is
not about revenge, and definitely not about victimhood. [The crux of
self- determination---the key demand of the politicized nationalist and
leftist wings of the black power movement]{.underline}---[was the
collective ability to choose the future that has the highest likelihood
of being just;]{.underline} depending on one's ideology, [this was a
future that was often seen to be egalitarian and sometimes
nonpatriarchal, one where blacks would be able to govern
themselves]{.underline}. This was a politics more consistent with Marx
than Nietzsche. The demand for a discussion of reparations, like the
best of the truth and reconciliation movements, is an invitation to
discuss how to build a system free from domination, racial and
otherwise. I partly agree with Brown's argument that

making a historical event or formation contemporary, making it "an
outrage to the present" and thus exploding or reworking both the way in
which it has been remembered and the way in which it is positioned in
historical consciousness as "past," is precisely the opposite of
bringing that phenomena to "closure" through reparation or apology (our
most ubiquitous form of historical political thinking today). The former
demands that we redeem the past through a specific and contemporary
practice of justice; the latter gazes impotently at the past even as it
attempts to establish history a irrelevant to the present or, at best,
as a reproachful claim or grievance in the present.

We must begin the process of "making a historical event . . . 'an
outrage to the present.'" Yet there is no inherent contradiction that
prevents a reparations movement or truth and reconciliation movement
from taking on this role. There is no inherent reason that such
movements need wallow impotently in the past. How reparations and truth
and reconciliation movements unfold is a product of the political
contestation that takes place within these movements---of the politics
that govern their development. I do energetically agree that [Brown's
critique]{.underline} well [describes much of post-black-power-era black
politics, a politics that]{.underline} by and large [embraces the values
and constraints of neoliberalism, including an emaciated understanding
of the politically allowable and feasible]{.underline}. A process of
truth and reconciliation, as messy and undoubtedly rancorous as it would
be, could help us move beyond the current degenerate state of American
politics to a politics that is more truly democratic.

2\. [The black public sphere]{.underline}, what I have called the black
counterpublic, [must be rebuilt from the bottom up, and
quickly]{.underline}. We need to learn from some of the more
technologically innovative forces within the progressive movement to use
technology as a way to help people in neighborhoods meet and talk
face-to-face, have these smaller groups link to each other's discussion,
and give people at the local level an online set of tools to help them
organize themselves. [The black public sphere has historically been
central to the multiple social movements that have emerged out of black
civil society]{.underline}, movements [that]{.underline} in turn
[transformed America for the better. The black public
sphere]{.underline}, as King and many others have said,
[has]{.underline} also [been]{.underline} the site of trenchant,
effective and influential critiques of democracy in America, as well as
[the instrument through which African Americans have been
able]{.underline}, sometimes effectively, [to influence political
debate]{.underline} within the country as a whole. [That is why it must
be rebuilt]{.underline}.

3\. People do have to hit the streets. [F]{.underline}ranklin
[D]{.underline}elano [R]{.underline}oosevelt [told progressive members
of Congress]{.underline} that [he agreed with them and]{.underline}
[they needed to force him to do what they all wanted. The people best
following that advice today are right-wing, racist]{.underline}, but
[strategic fanatics who have already hijacked political discourse and
are on the verge of winning a series of policy and political victories
that would be truly devastating. I do not understand why broad sections
of the liberal and progressive movements still believe]{.underline} that
[bringing about serious change, let alone the revolution]{.underline}
dreamed of by those such as King, [is like a dinner party. It is
not]{.underline}. [Making change entails being willing to
fight]{.underline}. [This country needs a social democratic movement
with teeth]{.underline}, not one that exhibits better manners than those
found at most academic dinner parties. [We need a real grassroots
movement]{.underline}, not the ersatz one foisted on us by the 2008
Obama presidential campaign, as Berlant incisively argues---one that
transforms, not just tweaks, the system. [If]{.underline}, as Berlant
suggested, "[the beast of civil society stirs from \[a\] long sleep,"
then it is black radicals' task to once again organize so that the beast
awakes]{.underline}---once again shaking the pillars of heaven. It is
past time---Albo and his colleagues were absolutely correct when they
bluntly reminded us, "The \[financial\] crisis has shown . . .
neoliberal claims to be ideological rubbish".

For some, the Occupy movement, which began to spread during 2011 and
focused intense political attention on various forms of economic
injustice and inequality, potentially represented such a movement, but
in many regions it grew largely without organized participation from
black radicals.

We saw this process begin in Wisconsin as public workers there and
across the nation, along with their supporters, began to massively
mobilize against the state's right-wing governor, Scott Walker, and his
successful attempts to destroy state workers' unions (which were
followed by parallel initiatives in other states). As gratifying as the
countermobilizations in Wisconsin and elsewhere were, they were entirely
defensive in nature. [People have to hit the street]{.underline}
offensively, not to try to gain back what has been taken away (although
that too) but [to make demands for action that will improve people's
lives]{.underline}, not just barely maintain them at a desperate level
of survival.

We must heed Marta Harnecker when she argues, "it is a huge mistake to
try to lead grassroots movements by ordering them around, by coming to
them with already-worked-out plans". As she continued to explain,
progressives must involve everyone at some level. We need to work to
ensure that people can participate at the level they are able, while
finding venues through which as many as possible have a stake in
progressive social movements.

4\. We have to renew our commitment to the value of meaningful work that
can actually support oneself and one's loved ones, and to education for
all that not only makes it possible to acquire meaningful and rewarding
work but allows each person to dis- cover for themselves what it means
to flourish while contributing to society. Berlant put it well:

Optimism for the present would require the Left to focus on rethinking
the structure of labor or work in relation to being- with. . . . There
is so little work now, the sense of value might as well be reinvented.
There is so little commitment to public education now, its purposes
might as well be reimagined from the bottom up---but not its people, for
education has to be the ground for the popular. Not the education that
preunderstands a vocation, but education as the inculcated relation to
work whose value is not just ends-oriented apprenticeship or putting in
time but diffused, risky, and a bit random not just about tasks but
about making worlds.

5\. [One area that desperately needs]{.underline} the type of
[innovation and experimentation generated by pragmatic utopian thinking
is the]{.underline} [institutional arrangements that govern the
functioning of modern civil society, the state, and the relationship
between the two]{.underline}. In his book Democracy Realized, Roberto
Unger argued that [to achieve truly democratic societies we must
concentrate on institutional innovations and experimentation that put
into place a robust and humane democracy. For this type of innovation to
be]{.underline} designed and [implemented]{.underline}, Unger suggested,
[a "transformative and solidaristic" political project is necessary.
That]{.underline} transformative political process in turn
[requires]{.underline} that "[we speak in the two languages of interest
calculation and political prophecy]{.underline}," what I have called
[the language of pragmatic utopianism]{.underline}. One might disagree
with Unger's specific institutional proposals, but he was right in
stating that [institutions shape our perceptions of our interests as
well as our ideological predispositions, and]{.underline} that [when
designing institutions we must remain flexible so as to be able to adapt
to new situations]{.underline}, adopt good ideas from elsewhere, [and
correct mistakes]{.underline}. In short, [given the central role that
institutions play in shaping our lives]{.underline}, economics, and
politics, [we can no longer allow them to become rigid and inflexible,
unable to serve the needs of society's citizens]{.underline}. Not only
must the institutions themselves remain flexible, but [we must be
willing to constantly innovate, to tinker, to experiment]{.underline}.
Only through this type of flexibility and willingness to experiment will
it be possible to discover the type of educational institutions Berlant
described. Badiou characterized this process as "combining intellectual
constructs, which are always global and universal, with experiments of
fragments of truth, which are local and singular, yet universally
transmittable."

6\. [We must]{.underline} also [reclaim the]{.underline} proud [black
radical anti-imperialist tradition]{.underline} that began in the
nineteenth century and has continued into the twenty-first century. As I
have shown in other work, grassroots [African Americans]{.underline}
generally [continue to be against]{.underline} the [use of
the]{.underline} American [military abroad]{.underline}. Further,
blacks, unlike a majority of whites in the first years of the
twenty-first century, also believed that protesting what one thought was
an unjust war was perfectly patriotic. Yet now, for the first time in
over a century, black elites are often silent when it comes to
commenting on U.S. involvement in foreign wars, particularly those in
the Middle East. An anti-imperialist analysis of the mass protest from
the streets of Egypt and Tunisia to those of an increasingly leftist
Latin America is also conspicuously missing from the black public
sphere. [One of the central reasons for quickly rebuilding a strong
black counterpublic is to enable the type of foreign policy debates that
have been missing from black discourse]{.underline} for much of the last
dozen years. We should learn from the moral and analytical failures of
the first two periods of black leftist insurgency and eschew any blind
faith in foreign models. [We have to engage in the hard task of trying
to understand the currents at work in this world and embrace those that
are most promising for increasing democracy and the well-being of
humanity]{.underline}, even if they are [in opposition to current
American foreign policy]{.underline}.

7\. Finally, [we have to become comfortable with trying to effect change
without knowing all the answers in advance. This is the only possible
route to the dismantling of oppressive hierarchies of power such as
those based on gender, class, and race and their protean
intersections]{.underline}. Traditional Marxism is like game theory---
both are based on precise analysis of the world but have built into
those analyses assumptions that make analysis tractable. Both ultimately
recoil from and then ignore the inherent messiness of mass human
behavior and politics. In the end our teleologies are shackles. We
should not fly blind, but we no longer can afford the certainty that has
proved to be a deadly illusion.

Marx despised utopian thinking, but I argue that [since we can no longer
pretend the social world works]{.underline} in a Newtonian manner, [with
deterministic laws and a predestined end, we must utilize utopian
thinking. We can still be realists, pragmatists if we must,
but]{.underline} at least [we must not limit ourselves in imagining what
could be better futures. We can argue about what these would entail and
how they could be realized. But dream we must]{.underline}. Those
[dreams must be debated and eventually transformed into political
programs aimed at transformative change]{.underline}.

Where Do We Go from Here?

[Pragmatic utopianism demands not just]{.underline} the critically
important step of [beginning to imagine a just and good society but
action. Movements must be organized to build that society, test
competing visions, and fight off the forces of reaction and privilege
that profit from the degradation of the great majority of
humanity]{.underline} and the very earth itself. King understood that
the answer to his question "[Where do we go from here?" demanded a
program of action]{.underline}. It demanded mobilization and education.
It demanded that black radicals of all stripes---feminist, social
democratic, Marxist, and nationalist---step "once more unto the breach,
dear friends, once more."

When it comes to [the struggle for a just society]{.underline}, for a
good life for the majority of humanity, for the end of an ever-mutating
but oppressive racial order, stepping unto the breach [necessitates that
the lessons of the two key periods of twentieth-century black
radicalism]{.underline} and the lessons of the sundering [be applied and
adapted]{.underline} for this century. [Independent radical
organizations dedicated to fighting for justice and equality for
blacks]{.underline}, for an end to the deadly racial order, [must be
rebuilt]{.underline}. Organizations of black leftists, feminists,
egalitarian liberals, and nationalists must be rebuilt or strengthened
to take on the issues of economic inequality, the continuing
disadvantage that faces blacks and especially black children, gender
disadvantage, and the incarceration state. They must stand with the
majority of humanity and against the new imperialist land grabs and
division of the world by this era's great powers. These powerful forces
are no less interested in dominating markets, extracting natural
resources (including energy and increasingly food resources), and
exploiting cheap overseas labor than the imperialists that black
radicals fought in the past. [Organizations of black radicals
must]{.underline} once again [embrace a radical domestic agenda that is
tied to a worldview that demands justice for all of
humanity]{.underline}, not just those who live in rich and privileged
countries. [These organizations need to hold elected
officials]{.underline}, corporate executives, public intellectuals, and
scholars [accountable to the communities they purport to
represent]{.underline}, exploit, speak for, and study.

The black radical organizations I describe here do bear some
similarities to the third-path organizations discussed in the previous
chapters. There must be some changes in addition to the ones already
specified. First, black radical organizations need to be nimble,
innovative, willing to experiment, and flexible---traits often missing
from the organizations that have attracted black radicals in the past.
Being nimble and innovative means being willing to change organizational
forms as needed, even being open to experimenting with different forms
simultaneously. This means that there will be a mix of small
collectives, medium-sized organizations, and perhaps some of regional
scope. There will be black radical organizations, and multiracial
organizations to which black radicals belong; some black radicals may
belong to both types. These organizations are also more likely to be
able to respond to and use the vast amount of information that is the
hallmark of the digital age. Large, rigidly structured organization in
fields of endeavor from business to government have failed due to their
inability to work with and within the ever-growing infosphere. The black
public sphere, which we must strengthen and rebuild, already exists
partially in cyberspace.

Black radical organizations also need to be far less hierarchical than
in the past. This will help them avoid penetration by hostile forces and
attempts to silence a small and easily identifiable leadership. But it
will also help them avoid a pitfall for black radical organizations of
both past periods: being far too undemocratic. We must move from the
patriarchal and antidemocratic leadership of past black radical
organizations and adopt styles and principles of leadership from the
black feminist wing of black radicalism.

[Black organizations]{.underline} of different types [must]{.underline}
once again be willing to [test their ideas in theory and practice
against those of other forces, but]{.underline} unlike in the
past---unless we want to relive the sundering before we have even
rebuilt the movement---[we must also learn to work with each other
despite our differences]{.underline}. [Black movements are at their
strongest when several different types of organizations with multiple
points of views are working within black communities]{.underline}. The
united fronts of the past, both the black and multiracial varieties, are
desperately needed to confront a system of inequality that viciously
attacks democratic movements wherever they appear.

And [we must do this now]{.underline}. We must remember one of the
positive lessons that black Maoist movements understood a generation
ago: "\[Maoism\] challenged the idea that the march to socialism must
take place in stages or that one must wait patiently for the proper
objective conditions to move ahead" . [Crisis after crisis is
devastating peoples and nations; the environment and entire economies
are held hostage so that the bankers of the most powerful countries can
continue to derive extraordinary profits while gaming the system so that
there exists nothing like either a free market or a level playing
field]{.underline}. [Black radical movements are]{.underline} once
[again needed to take their place in]{.underline} the growing [worldwide
struggles against multiple forms of radical inequality and
injustice]{.underline}. The example of Hubert Harrison and all of his
black radical comrades with all of their human flaws should inspire us
to build movements that can in the twenty-first century fight racism,
class oppression, patriarchy, and homophobia. We may no longer take the
classic third path, but it still has much to teach us.

'Anti-War' Left For Fools,"
https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/russia-plays-western-anti-war-left-for-fools/

I call it prescient because 17 years later, as Russia looks poised to
invade Ukraine, [there is]{.underline} yet again [a vocal segment of the
left that, far from being anti-war, effectively excuses]{.underline}
Russian dictator Vladimir [Putin's revanchism and gives him tacit
approval to attack, while showing utter contempt for Ukraine's
sovereignty and right to set its own domestic and foreign
policies]{.underline}. Most public attention has focused on the
pro-Russian appeasement by right-wing figures like Fox News host Tucker
Carlson, but the left-wing equivalent to that appeasement is no less
dangerous or despicable.

As of Sunday, Putin had positioned an estimated 130,000 soldiers and
advanced weaponry along Ukraine's borders with Russia and Belarus, as
numerous Western countries warned their citizens to leave. The US and
other Western countries have promised a raft of economic sanctions and
sent weapons to Ukraine to defend itself, but they have ruled out
actually sending forces into Ukraine.

But let's be clear: If [war]{.underline} breaks out, it [will be an act
of unprovoked aggression and entirely the fault of Putin's regime and
nobody else]{.underline} -- not Ukraine, not NATO and not the US. And
when thousands of Ukrainian men, women and children die, it will be
Russian bombs and bullets killing them.

[But listen to some people on the Western left, and you'd
think]{.underline} they live in the "Star Trek" Mirror Universe, where
[the US about to invade Ukraine, while Russia is just an innocent victim
defending its interests]{.underline}.

A Feb. 9 article by Jacobin magazine writer Branko Marcetic is a prime
example of this bizarro view. Citing a Feb. 8 op-ed in The Guardian by
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Marcetic -- like Sanders -- takes at face
value Russia's phony concerns about "NATO expansion" and whines that
it's "neo-McCarthyism" to suggest people parroting Russian propaganda
are pro-Russian. But he really takes the cake when he gives a nod of
agreement to views from right-wing figures like Carlson and Sen. Josh
Hawley, R-Mo.

Marcetic doesn't bother mentioning Carlson's white nationalism or
Hawley's support for the Jan. 6 insurrectionists, only halfheartedly
admitting they're "the worst people in the world" before saying they
"have a point."

Hawley, apparently, has a point in "warning that 'our interest is not so
strong' in Ukraine's independence and sovereignty that it would 'justify
committing the United States to go to war with Russia.'" Carlson,
meanwhile, "accurately" compared Ukraine joining NATO to Mexico allying
with China and questioned Ukraine's strategic value to the US, while
Marcetic gushes that Republicans adopting Carlson's positions marks "a
notable shift for a party that has typically never met a war it didn't
want to charge into."

It's weird that Hawley is speaking of going to war with Russia, given
that the US has explicitly taken that option off the table. And
Carlson's comparison of Ukraine joining NATO to a Chinese-Mexican
alliance is nonsensical given the US does not pose any military threat
to Mexico, whereas Russia poses an immediate one to Ukraine, after
having already invaded and occupied Crimea. But both of these statements
display contempt for Ukraine, its safety and its right to sovereignty
without Russian interference, as Marcetic does in approvingly reprinting
them.

As for Sanders's view that Russia has "legitimate concerns" about
post-Soviet countries joining NATO, that overlooks the fact that the
whole reason why the Baltic countries, Ukraine and Georgia -- which
Russia invaded in 2008 -- would want to join NATO is that they have far
more legitimate concerns about Russian aggression.

Ryan Grim, Washington bureau chief for The Intercept, displayed similar
contempt on Feb. 11 when he sarcastically tweeted, "If Russia retakes
Ukraine, what if it becomes a hotbed of corruption, ruled by bickering
oligarchs? We can't have that."

Despite his problematic use of the word "retakes," he subsequently
tweeted that he is "100% opposed to Russia invading Ukraine." But his
tweet showed the same disregard for Ukraine's sovereignty as Marcetic
and a sneering dismissiveness toward its efforts to develop rule of law
and root out corruption, as every nascent democracy recovering from
decades of dictatorship must do.

One of the worst comments came in the form of a Feb. 3 tweet by ice
cream producer Ben & Jerry's that said, "Sending thousands more US
troops to Europe in response to Russia's threats against Ukraine only
fans the flame of war" and suggesting the Biden administration was
"\[preparing\] for war." The day before, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.,
sounded a similar note, criticizing the administration for sending
weapons to Ukraine because it "escalates the conflict."

Weird, because I thought it was Russia's deploying, without provocation,
130,000 soldiers to the Ukrainian border, poised to invade, that was
escalating things.

[The basic premise of these ideas is]{.underline} that [the US and NATO
should do nothing substantial to deter Russia from invading and then sit
on their hands if it actually does invade. The bigger question is why so
many leftists who claim to be anti-war and anti-imperialist would give
succor to Russia as it engages in the very warmongering and imperialism
they claim to deplore]{.underline}.

[One]{.underline} possible [reason is a longstanding binary worldview
that sees the US as the main cause of the world's problems and so
irredeemably evil that it praises any nation opposing its
interests]{.underline} -- e.g., [the Soviet Union during the Cold War,
Russia in the present, China, Venezuela or Syria. This inevitably leads
to double standards when it comes to imperialism and human rights abuses
and a tendency to blame the US and its allies first]{.underline}.

The Iraq war didn't help either, giving rise to isolationism and
kneejerk cynicism about American foreign policy whereby anything
emanating from the Pentagon or State Department is assumed to be a lie.
But unlike Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, Russia's forces amassed
along Ukraine's border are clearly visible.

[Another is Russian propaganda, disseminated by state-owned outlets like
RT and Sputnik. They have been tremendously successful at pumping
pro-Russian ideas into Western political discourse while]{.underline}
also [promoting anti-system populist politics aimed at exacerbating
divisions and destabilizing democracies. Kremlin propagandists can count
every Westerner sincerely arguing Russia has "legitimate concerns" about
"NATO expansion" as a success story]{.underline}.

But [a larger reason is a failure to admit what Russia actually is and
always has been, which is a colonial empire, every bit as much as its
Spanish, British and French counterparts]{.underline}. The [differences
are that it was an empire of land rather than sea, and]{.underline} that
with the collapse of the monarchy in 1917 [it slapped a left-wing
revolutionary coat of paint onto a state that remained just as
imperialist as when the tsars ruled from Petrograd]{.underline}.

That's why Georgia's first tenure as a democratic republic after
declaring independence in 1918 lasted only three years, ending with the
Red Army invading and taking over the country in 1921. Armenia and
independence movements in Central Asia experienced similar fates.

Consequently, the [decolonization]{.underline} that Spain, the UK and
other European powers underwent after World War II [didn't come to
Russia until 1991]{.underline}, when the Soviet Union collapsed. That
decolonization is what Putin referred to as "the greatest geopolitical
catastrophe of the century" in 2005.

[But where other former European colonial powers are content to let
their former colonies govern their own affairs, Putin cannot tolerate
former Russian colonies doing the same. That's why pro-democratic
uprisings in post-Soviet countries]{.underline} -- most recently Belarus
and Kazakhstan -- [scare him so much and is likely the reason he has his
eyes on Ukraine]{.underline}. After all, [a Ukraine that is free,
democratic and prosperous and enjoys close ties with the West threatens
his ill-gotten power and wealth, as it might cause Russians to start
asking why they can't have democracy and prosperity too]{.underline}.

[If a war breaks out in Europe, it will happen because a predatory,
kleptocratic mafia state presided over by a psychopathic dictator
started it]{.underline}. It will be because all the diplomacy in the
world could not stop Putin's revanchist desire to restore Soviet power.
[Undermining efforts to prevent that from happening or punish Putin's
regime if he does invade isn't anti-war]{.underline}.

**Contingency is [true]{.underline} and denying that
[strengthens]{.underline} white supremacy.**

KELLEY: Um, Fred---Fred will take most of these questions. So that\'s
why I\'m going to begin first because he\'s gonna, he\'s gonna---he\'s
gonna end it because he, he, he has the answer to all these questions
'cause I turn to him for these questions. On the specific, on the first
question, I just want to make sure I understand it because I\'m, you
know, I don\'t always recognize, uh, it may be because I\'m just old,
but [I don\'t]{.underline} always [recognize]{.underline}, uh, [that
black politics]{.underline}, black \[unclear---maybe "guys"\] work
politics [have been structured or defined by white
supremacy]{.underline}. I mean, white supremacy is there. And I guess
maybe because I\'m such a student of Cedric Robinson, you know, [not
everything is about]{.underline}, [or in response to]{.underline},
[white supremacy]{.underline}. And in fact, one of the critiques coming
out of doing Southern history was this idea that race relations
framework, that race relations defines, uh, African-American history or
Black history. And it\'s simply not true [because]{.underline} much of
what people do in terms of, of [social formation]{.underline},
[community building]{.underline}, um, is, is, is what Raymond Williams
might call alternative cultures. In other words, it [may be structured
in dominance]{.underline} in some ways, [but not defined by
it]{.underline}. And Cedric\'s Black Marxism, you know, really made this
point. He talks about the ontological totality, you know, the, this
sense of being and making ourselves whole, in that we come out of an
experience, again, structured by white supremacy, structured by
violence, structured by enslavement and dispossession, but, but one in
which western hegemony didn\'t work, you know, that modes of thinking
wasn\'t defined by Enlightenment modes of thinking. In other words,
that, that part of the [Black radical tradition is a
refusal]{.underline} to be property, [to even admit that human beings
could be property]{.underline}. You know, so [we]{.underline} sometimes
[give white supremacy way too much credit]{.underline}, and maybe I
misunderstood the question. And so I think that there\'s lots of things
that happen outside of joy and survival, and survival is important, but
survival is not the end all, you know. So I think, and I\'ll give you
one very, very specific example, and now I\'m not gonna say anything
else after this. The way we have tended [to]{.underline} more recently
[treat slavery, Jim Crow and mass incarceration as]{.underline} a piece,
as the reinstantiation of [the same thing]{.underline}, [the
continuation]{.underline}, that [denies]{.underline} the fact [that
these systems are actually distinct]{.underline}, that they are
[historically specific]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} in fact they're
[responses to]{.underline}, in many ways, to [the weakness of
this]{.underline} as [a racial regime]{.underline}. So if you think of
like the whole idea of the new Jim Crow to me is very, very problematic.
Um, although that book by Michelle Alexander is very, very powerful and
very useful in terms of educating people about prisons. [Jim Crow was
not the continuation of slavery]{.underline}. It was not. [Jim Crow was
a response to the Black Democratic]{.underline}, uh, [upsurge after
slavery]{.underline}. It was a revolution of
[Reconstruction]{.underline}. It [was a way to try to suppress
that]{.underline}. The fact that, that, you know, there was this
incredible response. [That\'s why there\'s]{.underline} a, there\'s [a
huge gap between 1877 at the]{.underline} official [end of
Reconstruction and the rise of Jim Crow]{.underline}, [which is the
1890s]{.underline}, disfranchisement, lynching. That\'s [because you\'ve
had]{.underline} 13, 14, 15, 20, [25 years of]{.underline} a [democratic
possibility and struggle]{.underline}. [The same]{.underline} thing
[with mass incarceration]{.underline}---yes, we\'ve had incarceration,
but it\'s, but that, that, that, that upward swing has a lot to do with,
again, [responses to the struggles in the 1960s]{.underline}, [the
assault on the]{.underline} Keynesian welfare-[warfare
state]{.underline}, the fact that you know the, the war on political,
the formation of political prisoners, those struggles in fact [was the
state\'s response to opposition]{.underline}. And so [if we don\'t
acknowledge that]{.underline}, then what [we]{.underline} end up doing
is [think]{.underline}ing that somehow [there\'s a structure of white
supremacy that\'s]{.underline} unchanging, [fixed]{.underline}, [and so
powerful we can\'t do anything about it when]{.underline} in fact [it\'s
the opposite]{.underline}. [White supremacy is fragile]{.underline}.
White supremacy is [weak]{.underline}. [Racial regimes]{.underline}
actually are [always]{.underline} having to [shore themselves
up]{.underline} precisely [because they\'re unstable]{.underline}. We
can see that. We can\'t see it because [the]{.underline} whole
[system]{.underline} of hegemony is to [give us the impression that it
is so powerful]{.underline}, there\'s no space out. And [yet it's
working overtime]{.underline} to, [to respond to our
opposition]{.underline}. Right. That may not answer your question, but
that\'s sort of a way I think about it. Maybe it's not satisfactory, but
yeah.

**Political hope is [good]{.underline}, and denying it
[erases]{.underline} Black agency.**

1\. Dewey, Glaude, and the Shortcomings of US Democracy

In John Dewey\'s terms, [\'democracy\' is not]{.underline} a
[fixed]{.underline} value, [nor is]{.underline} it even a system of
[governance]{.underline}. Rather, democracy denotes [an
ongoing]{.underline} process wherein the egalitarian [struggle for equal
social and political participation]{.underline} is undertaken. According
to literary critic and cultural historian Louis Menand, Dewey sought to
promote \"in every area of life, including industrial life, democracy,
which he interpreted as the practice of \'associated
living\'---cooperation with others on a basis of tolerance and
equality\" (373). In his view, [democracy is a structural impossibility
in]{.underline} the [absence of individual efforts to change the social
practices that organize the sociopolitical]{.underline} order. Moreover,
Dewey\'s philosophical doctrine suggests that a democratic social
formation takes the individual to be a \"function\" of the total
political body (Dewey, \"Ethics\" 205). To vote in representative
democratic systems is not simply a mechanic expression of political
participation but rather \"a manifestation of some tendency of the
social organism through a member of that organism\" (\"Ethics\" 189).
[The norms and values of the polity are]{.underline}, in other words,
[determined]{.underline} and expressed [at the level of the
individual]{.underline}.

In \"Creative Democracy\" (1939), Dewey repeats this sentiment.
\"Instead of thinking of our own dispositions and habits as accommodated
to certain institutions,\" he writes, \"we have to learn to [think
of]{.underline} the latter \[[institutions]{.underline}\]
[as]{.underline} expressions, projections and [extensions of habitually
dominant personal attitudes]{.underline}\" (\"Creative\" 226). Proper
democracy materializes in individual practices, [not theoretical
abstractions]{.underline} nor institutionalized policies. [The
democratic process is \'always\']{.underline} in the stage of
[becoming]{.underline}. In that spirit, Dewey concludes his essay with
idealistic fervor, positing that \"the task of democracy is forever that
of creation of a freer and more humane experience in which all share and
to which all contribute\" (\"Creative\" 230).

In its ideal mode, then, democracy manifests in [effective
action]{.underline}, a process that [allows for the continuous
reconfiguration of the structures that undergird]{.underline} US
[society]{.underline}. Scholar of pragmatism Giles Gunn has noted that
such democratic impulses, which are part and parcel of a vibrant
political community, promise to enrich the political experiences of all
who partake in the community\'s formation, especially when these
democratic impulses are framed by \"forms of creativity and critical
discourse\" (79). Eddie Glaude, who self-identifies as a \"Deweyan
pragmatist,\" (Shade of Blue 5) has nonetheless commented that if
\"pragmatism is native to American soil,\"(2) then it \"carries with it
all the possibilities and limitations that have defined our \[American\]
fragile experiment in democracy\" (2). As Glaude points out, the
subjects who occupy society\'s margins define the boundaries of the US
democratic experiment. In this context, the social practices that inform
ordinary people\'s day-to-day routines---the spaces we inhabit along
with the ways we include or exclude other people in our personal
lives---crystallize as \"projections and extensions of habitually
dominant personal attitudes\" (Dewey, \"Creative\" 226). [In order to
transform the political status quo]{.underline}, this line of
argumentation implies that [the individual]{.underline} subject [must be
willing to]{.underline} critically and creatively examine and thereafter
[modify]{.underline} her [habits]{.underline}.

\"Habits\" is a keyword in Deweyan pragmatism. Dewey views the
individual subject\'s behavior as systematically organized by a set of
experientially learned responses, the primary function of which is to
automatize how we individually address both quotidian and unexpected
events in our daily lives. But, for Dewey, \"habit\" is an unfixed,
unstable category. The formation of [habits]{.underline} is an ongoing
endeavor, and \"an individual\" can [undergo]{.underline} \"a
[modification through]{.underline} an [experience]{.underline}, which
modification forms a predisposition to easier and more effective action
in a like direction in the future\" (\"Theories\" 212). In Deweyan
pragmatism, lived experiences constitute a rich source for cultivating
and refining one\'s own relationship with the material world; Dewey even
endows this mode of knowledge production with the capacity to transform
the individual subject\'s social and political outlook.

However, the vitality of Dewey\'s philosophy will be undercut if one\'s
engagement with the past is perfunctory or superficial. On that account,
it is crucial to act shrewdly and with care, because a \"habit apart
from knowledge does not make allowance for change of conditions, for
novelty\" (\"Theories\" 212). Phrased more succinctly, habits form a
backdrop for life choices, and it is not only the formation of habits
but also their re-formation that influences how an experience can lead
to \"easier and more effective action\" (212) in the future. The
democratic thrust of habit (re-)formation should thus be clear: It
requires an intelligent response from the individual subject to the
particular circumstances that engulf her life. To that end, [past
experiences]{.underline} must govern the subject\'s life choices if
these experiences are to [affect how]{.underline} she \[[the
individual]{.underline}\] navigates and, in turn, [influences
social]{.underline}, cultural, [and political landscapes]{.underline}.
\"While the content of knowledge,\" in Dewey\'s formulation, \"is what
has happened, what is taken as finished and hence settled and sure, the
reference of knowledge is future or prospective. For knowledge furnishes
the means of understanding or giving meaning to what is still going on
and what is to be done\" (214). As a matter of course, [we are bound to
reproduce regressive habits if we do not engage our]{.underline} lived
[experiences]{.underline} creatively and intelligently. Only [by way
of]{.underline} intelligent action---which \"includes deliberate
choice,\" that is, [agency]{.underline}---can we institute a more
egalitarian future (212).

Dewey proposed that a modern democratic society only could be improved
when the social and political practices of its participants are grounded
in the creative application of experiential knowledge. Thus, lived
experiences are inseparable from habit formation; and, given that habits
are ultimately expressed in actions, it is important to identify how the
individual subject orients herself in the world of experience. To that
end, Dewey distinguishes between what he calls \'cognitive experiences\'
and \'cognized experiences.\' The term \"cognitive experience\"
describes an experience that transpires immediately without any deep or
significant reflection on the part of the individual subject
(\"Postulate\" 396). In contrast, the concept of \"cognized
experiences\" charts a series of experiences in retrospect, which
enables the actor to \"transform\" or \"reorganize\" the meaning of
those experiences so they can be oriented towards meaningful prospective
action (396). As a consequence, Deweyan pragmatism has serious political
ramifications. [Subjects who have been excluded]{.underline} from the
\"fragile experiment in democracy\" (Glaude, Shade of Blue 2)---
[African Americans]{.underline}, in the present
context---[can]{.underline}, within this philosophical framework,
[develop future-oriented strategies of sociopolitical participation that
subvert]{.underline} the authority of [the political powers that
be]{.underline}.

[These strategies demand an imaginative leap by the African
American]{.underline} subject, [Glaude]{.underline} observes, and he
[asserts]{.underline} that [African American slaves
achieved]{.underline} a unique type of personal [freedom when they
imagined themselves \"in terms that are not those of the slave
master\"]{.underline} (Uncommon 9). In light of the historical
continuity of racial oppression, Glaude\'s commentary on the possibility
of self-creation during slavery informs how [African Americans have
carved out spaces]{.underline}, or gaps, [that are theirs to define
within an oppressive sociopolitical structure]{.underline} in antebellum
and postbellum United States alike. For even though African American
subject positions have evolved over time and transcended the relation of
legalized enslavement, \"the afterlife of slavery,\" to borrow Saidiya
Hartman\'s term, always already structures African Americans as
second-class citizens (Mother 6).7

Similar to Glaude\'s observation that the imagination can be a powerful
resource for self-making, Dewey posited: \"The connection between
imagination and the harmonizing of the self is closer than is usually
thought,\" and \"the whole self\" is indeed \"an ideal, an imaginative
projection\" (Common Faith 17). A subject\'s life unfolds in accordance
with certain \'known\' circumstances or facts, but these only partially
reveal the world of experience. Indeed, it is at any given time
impossible to actively perceive more than a small fragment of the social
world. [At the level of the imagination]{.underline}, however, [vast
spaces of possibilities emerge and African Americans have in
these]{.underline} novel [spaces imagined ideal ends]{.underline}, or
particular purposes, that are [independent from the fixed ascriptions of
subjectivity that otherwise limit their]{.underline} prospects of
[political agency]{.underline}.

As Glaude would have it, the [African American subject\'s]{.underline}
imaginative engagement with her lived experiences elicits a mode in
which she [can envision alternative futures that deviate from the status
quo]{.underline}. This \"new vision,\" Dewey might add, \"does not arise
out of nothing, but emerges through seeing, in terms of possibilities,
that is, of imagination, old things in new relations serving a new end
which the new end aids in creating\" (Common Faith 46). Undoubtedly,
such a commitment to an open-ended, future-oriented life world can
result in the violent subjection of the dissenting subject and her
political ideas. But Glaude notes that the [imaginative disengagement
from the structures of domination]{.underline} already in place [incites
social change]{.underline} as well. He uses the term \"meliorism\" to
describe \"[the belief that our circumstances at a given
moment]{.underline}, be they comparatively good or bad,
[can]{.underline} be [improve]{.underline}d (Shade of Blue 31). Glaude
further states that \"\[s\]uch a view [commands]{.underline} intelligent
[action]{.underline} in the sense that it encourages us to inquire
in[to]{.underline} the [amelioration of problems]{.underline},
individual and social, and the obstructions to their resolution\" (31).
As Glaude explains, meliorism calls for categorically open-ended and
intelligent action; therefore, [the African American subject
must]{.underline} be [prepare]{.underline}d [for potentially fatal
consequences when embracing the possibility of improvement]{.underline}.

In his short essay \"I Believe\" (1939), Dewey identifies the impact
that subjects who deviate from the social, cultural, and political norms
can have on large-scale social change. Dewey argues that \"those who can
escape the hypnotic influence exercised by the immediate contemporary
scene are aware that movements going on in the interstices of the
existing order are those which will in fact shape the future \[emphasis
added\]\" (271). Creative and intelligent [utilization of the
unaccounted for gaps in the sociopolitical structure may]{.underline}
thus [gradually transform the]{.underline} US [social
formation]{.underline}, even as African Americans embrace the
melioristic view that the \"open-ended character of experience does not
offer clear pathways to achieve desired ends\" (Glaude, Uncommon 48).
[Rather than constituting a preexisting material structure]{.underline}
that ensures the rights and liberties of all citizens, Dewey holds that
democratic [societies constantly reconfigure]{.underline} their outer
boundaries [to produce a more inclusive social formation]{.underline}.

As highlighted above, the democratic process is, in Dewey\'s view, an
experimental enterprise. Although he admits, \"democracy is a complex
affair,\" Dewey\'s ideas still equip the individual subject with the
capacity to impact the sociopolitical structure (\"The Public\" 287).
According to Dewey, [political communities]{.underline}, whether
progressive or regressive, [always follow the will and actions of
individuals]{.underline}, [not a priori notions]{.underline} of
\'Truth\' or other abstract philosophical principles.8 Rather, [all
subjects are individually responsible for the state of]{.underline} US
[democracy]{.underline}, [because habits can always be changed to
reflect]{.underline} a [greater]{.underline} degree of [empathy and
inclusion]{.underline}. With recourse to creative experimentation and a
liberated imagination, Dewey in fact maintains that [each
subject]{.underline} always [already possesses the tools necessary to
re-form]{.underline} her [habits and]{.underline} thus [the larger
sociopolitical world]{.underline}.

[Neurocognitive mapping indicates]{.underline} that [people respond
subliminally to stimuli according to culturally regulated
norms]{.underline} and patterns [which appear resistant to
revision]{.underline}, in contrast to the ways that representational
[beliefs]{.underline} with logical syntactic structure [are readily
adjustable in light of new evidence]{.underline} (Levy, \"Am I a
Racist?\" 541). For instance, I can believe consciously that I am in a
safely enclosed ski lift with transparent walls and floor; yet when
moving on a sturdy rail away from a cliff edge, my body reacts as if I
am going to fall (Gendler, \"Alief and Belief\" 634). Subjects know one
thing about their environment but contextual cues suggest the illusion
of another --- such as when sitting comfortably and safely in a cinema,
the subject is subsumed with anxious tension while watching a horror
film, or experiences revulsion at an artefact verified to be chocolate
but is shaped like faeces. Sometimes, [people\'s affective responses to
experimentally constructed illusions]{.underline} and environmental
distortions [have been regarded on a par with puppies]{.underline} and
kittens [reacting in alarm at their]{.underline} own [reflections in a
mirror]{.underline} (Gendler, \"Alief in Action\" 552, 566).

It is discouraging how many philosophers of cognition treat implicit
racial bias as fitting into this category. [Unconscious racial
stereotyping is]{.underline} routinely [discussed as a \"natural\"
automated reaction]{.underline} of fear, or arousal or distress which is
inconsistent, deviant, or otherwise \"discordant\" with the egalitarian
subject\'s carefully considered judgments. For instance, Tamar Gendler
(\"Alief in Action\" 552 et passim) interprets the surge of cortisol
levels triggered by staged prompts and detected consistently in
experimental subjects as an evolutionary survival pattern, signifying
the activation of genetically encoded propensities to respond in ways
that are no longer serviceable --- implying, though, that they once
would have been. Alternatively, [the view of]{.underline} racial
aversion and [ethnic conflict as physiologically \"hardwired\" into
human biology has been countered by]{.underline} \"nurture\" theories
[that account for]{.underline} these aberrant vestigial reactions as
[acculturated traits]{.underline}, once [acquired through social
reinforcement as compulsory habits]{.underline} which have since become
mistaken or pointless.

Among all the proponents on different sides of these debates, however,
it is generally assumed that eliminating unwanted subliminal bias is a
priority which requires bio-feedback or some other strategy for
heightening the subject\'s self-awareness of autonomic responses as
deviant or wayward, in light of his or her rationally formed
evidence-responsive beliefs, in particular these egalitarian postulates
(Neville, \"Color-Blind Racial Ideology\" 457 ff.): (i) racial
appearance bears no relation to moral characteristics such as
intelligence, diligence, and trustworthiness; (ii) all human beings are
fundamentally the same; and (iii) no racially distinguishable group is
either superior or inferior to any other. These \"colour-blind\"
commitments will be examined in more detail in section 3, in so far as a
range of psychologists and critical race theorists have highlighted
their function in a contemporary rationale for the \"laissez-faire\"
(Bobo, Kruegel, and Smith) perpetuation of power dynamics constitutive
of racially stratified societies such as the United States and South
Africa (e.g., Block; Gallagher; Lebakeng, Phalane, and Dalindjebo;
Mills; Neville et al.; Yancy). But rather than referencing critical race
theorists, mainstream analytic philosophers, moral theorists and
epistemologists studying the psychology of racial bias adopt the
presuppositions of experimentalists whose empirical results they rely
upon in their analytic work.

[Experimental psychologists]{.underline} are disciplined to
[perfect]{.underline} as far as possible [the isolation of the
variables]{.underline} they use [to measure subjects\' subconscious
reactions]{.underline}, in order to meet the confidence levels and
related standards of reliability expected of the data their studies
produce. Just so, [in order to demonstrate aberrant biases]{.underline}
within the cognitive anatomy of avid egalitarians, [experimentalists
must disassociate the disorderly social environmental factors that
influence]{.underline} rational judgments, reasoned choices, alongside
[the subconscious reactions]{.underline}, [of experimental
subjects]{.underline} and experimentalists alike (Cudd; Lauer).

[Yet social norms are an integrated and uneliminable component of how we
process]{.underline} incoming [stimuli]{.underline} collaboratively in
order to navigate our daily social milieus successfully. [So it
is]{.underline} entirely [artificial to isolate and
disassociate]{.underline} individuals\' [subliminal affective
responses]{.underline} from their logical deliberations (Schwitzgebel),
while bracketing and deflecting attention away [from their broader
social environments]{.underline}. Of course, as just remarked,
controlling variables is essential for replicable testing of any
empirical hypothesis. But [this experimental finesse is]{.underline}
indulged [at a high cost]{.underline} in the move from social science to
social philosophy. [By artificially separating our]{.underline} conative
and [cognitive processes from the]{.underline} complex human
[environments that influence us]{.underline}, [there is the danger of
ignoring]{.underline} the fact that [what gets interpreted as
an]{.underline} individual\'s wayward, idiosyncratic [implicit attitude
may be the manifestation of a]{.underline} public\'s [widely
entrenched]{.underline} illicit [norm]{.underline}. The functionality of
an illicitly racist norm remains a taboo topic, unchallenged and
uncharted by the majority of psychologists conducting research in the
United States, for example, where the dominant intellectual and academic
cultures are overtly inclusive and egalitarian but covertly elitist and
hierarchical.5

When analytic philosophy turns to psycho-neural research to enhance
understanding of an earnest egalitarian\'s implicit racial bias,
negative stereotyping is framed as a feature of the individual\'s
\"mental apparatus\" (Mavda and Brownstein 24). But as will be discussed
next, [when]{.underline} derisive [discrimination is treated
as]{.underline} if it were an individual\'s [subconscious]{.underline}
aberration, [then the causes]{.underline} of an egalitarian\'s cognitive
dissonance [are confused with the effects]{.underline} themselves,
[i.e., the replicable artefacts]{.underline} ([EEG
patterns]{.underline}, [eye-blink rates]{.underline}, [rising cortisol
levels]{.underline}). For instance, Mavda and Brownstein announce that
by studying \"the cognitive architecture that perpetuates discrimination
and inequality\" (ibid.), their aim is to understand \"the way affective
and conative states function interde-pendently\" so that they may
\"choose a model that will inspire the greatest transformation \[ \...
\] to achieve the most de-biasing bang for our interventional buck\"
(23).

Given that these and other [philosophers]{.underline} are seeking
strategies to ameliorate the racial discrimination that implicit bias
purportedly fuels, it is surprising that they [neglect the
sizeable]{.underline} wealth of [uncontested data clearly
demonstrating]{.underline} that [effective behavioural]{.underline}
intervention requires focusing on \"systems and policies to directly
facilitate action, rather than trying to change what people think and
feel\" (Brewer 149). In section 4 we will see why [effecting
change]{.underline} necessarily [entails intervening directly into the
policies]{.underline} and procedures [constitutive of institutionalized
environments]{.underline} that are overtly egalitarian and racially
inclusive while remaining covertly hierarchical and racially exclusive
due to prevailing illicit social norms.

Arguably, the method of [testing and analysing subliminal mental
processes is not merely]{.underline} an [ineffective]{.underline}
approach to controlling implicit racial bias; [it actually contributes
to the maintenance of]{.underline} illicit [racial
stereotyping]{.underline}, [not only through the interpretation of
replicated data but also]{.underline} through [the manner in which that
data are assembled]{.underline}. For instance, [experimentalists choose
subjects for these studies]{.underline} from samples that are
representative of the population\'s norm. But in a \"laissez-faire\"
(Bobo, Kruegel, and Smith) racial hierarchy such as the contemporary
United States, the relevant norm is defined by racially advantaged
elites [who presume]{.underline}, among other \"colour-blind\" dogmatic
convictions, that [everyone\'s experience of the shared social world is
like their own]{.underline}. Thus a stock example of a stimulus regarded
by philosophers as being a self-evident \"threat,\" evoking \"feelings
of fear\" in subjects generally (Mavda and Brownstein 20) is the image
of an ambiguous object held by a brown eyed, dark toned man with
dreadlocks in a dashiki --- rather than by a blue-eyed, light skinned
man with blond hair in a police uniform.

But one would assume that if social injustice is a priority concern,
then the data set of greater philosophical significance, as well as
greater complexity and interest, contains the subject for whom standard
racist stereotypes are internalized against himself, and whose cortisol
levels are triggered, for instance, by the image of the white policeman.
Some of this \"Other\" subject\'s subliminal implicit expectations are
far from irrational; nor are his all subliminal responses ordinarily
discordant with evidence-based, inferentially structured, true beliefs,
given the statistical disparity between the fate of different racial
groups encountering white uniformed law enforcement authorities. Some of
his subliminal feelings of self-disregard are adaptive mechanisms which
suffice to cope in a threatening social environment (Cudd). For
instance, the posture of stooped shoulders, or giving way to others in a
queue, affects perhaps of conceding to one\'s subordinate status or low
self-esteem, are essential to avoid attracting the resentment or outrage
of uniformed policemen in a busy Burger King fast food restaurant in a
small town of southern Georgia, just to take a random example.

[If the]{.underline} theoretician\'s [goal in studying implicit bias is
to understand the contribution]{.underline} that [subliminal mental
processes make to perpetuating racial injustice]{.underline} (Gendler;
Levy; Brownstein and Saul), [then]{.underline} surely it will prove
inadequate to depend solely upon the armchair intuitions complemented by
the researched affective states of subjects belonging to racially
privileged groups. But in the main, analytic philosophers who rely upon
current [psychological research depicting implicit bias appear oblivious
to the inherent distortions]{.underline} --- not to mention irony --- of
embracing uncritically the premises of experiments whose intuitive,
self-evident significance is restricted almost exclusively to those who
are potentially advantaged by racial bias --- albeit passively and
regrettably. Only in rare cases is this selective standpoint assumed
explicitly, as when Neil Levy proposes to explore the conative
capacities of subliminal autonomic reactions on behalf of readers \"like
\[him\]\" (\"Am I a Racist?\" 534, 544, 546 inter alia).

The inevitability of error in philosophical theories dependent upon such
a narrow (indeed, racially biased) empirical data base hearkens back to
the theoretical shortfalls of developmental moral psychology exposed in
the early 1980s. Not until Carol Gilligan\'s seminal critique did anyone
realize the fundamental defect of Lawrence Kohlberg\'s erroneous, albeit
widely accepted \"finding\" that adult women measure as congenitally
incapable of making fully mature moral judgments on his aptitude scale
for measuring ethical reasoning in five gradated stages. This gross
misrepresentation was not attributed to Kohlberg\'s being any kind of
sexist, implicit or otherwise; but because Kohlberg\'s model of
childhood moral development was based upon Piaget\'s classic studies in
the field, which derived solely from tests conducted exclusively on boys
(Gilligan).

3 ontologizing negative racial stereotypes

Of course not all [philosophers]{.underline} addressing implicit racial
bias neglect the copious data depicting the predicaments of those
bearing the brunt of negative stereotyping. Lauren Freeman\'s work of
[extending the implications of research on \"stereotype
threat\"]{.underline} (Steele) is devoted to stressing the debilitating
effects of feeling discrimination first hand. In the Heideggerian
tradition, she elevates to a non-contingent, metaphysical
[postulate]{.underline} the trauma of being the target of negative
racial stereotypes: \"The experience of living as a member of a racially
oppressed group \[ \... \] cuts to the core of who one is and who one
can become\" (\"Phenomenology\" 36). She argues that such an invasive
impact affects everyone who bears the personal identity of negative
stereotyping so inescapably, and in ways so alien to any other form of
social injustice, assault or injury (like rape or war crime) that [being
racially oppressed constitutes belonging to an]{.underline} altogether
[unique ontological kind]{.underline}. Freeman employs the language of
ontology to highlight the schismatic polarization of oppressor and
oppressed via racial stigmatization. \"To be racially oppressed means to
have a different ontological constitution on account of one\'s social
position\" such that \"\[ \... \] the structure of one\'s being is
different from those who are not racially oppressed \[ \... \] one lives
in a different world\" (38---39). Freeman is keen to stress that [this
ontological architecture is not inherent]{.underline}; [it is
a]{.underline} socio-historical [effect of one\'s social
position]{.underline}. [Thus]{.underline} \"\[ \... \] [racial
oppression is reversible and preventable]{.underline}: [if]{.underline}
personal, [social]{.underline}, cultural, [and political
attitudes]{.underline} were to [change]{.underline}, [then]{.underline}
this type of \[ . \] [ontological]{.underline} \[ \... \] [harm could be
alleviated]{.underline}\" (40).

But it is not clear whether one can coherently countenance a distinct
ontological kind on the basis of a certain type of experience which can
be known about only by the members belonging to that kind who share
their own special point of view (Rosenthal). In a footnoted reply to an
objection accredited to David Owen, Freeman remarked:

> \[\... \] it is true that I \[ \... \] a white woman \[\... \] cannot
> experience first-personally what it is like to exist in a Black body
> \[\... \] I can still understand testimonies of what it is like. There
> is [sufficient first-person evidence]{.underline} to
> [suggest]{.underline} the [ontological structures of experience are
> substantially different]{.underline}. (41-42 n. 15)

Yet another concern about treating direct experience as the essential
criterion of membership in this ontological kind is the fact that
experiences associated with racial stereotyping contrast starkly not
only between members of different racial groups but more significantly
[between members of the same marginalized racial group]{.underline}
(Neville et al.; Block 255). The available [psychological research
indicates]{.underline} that derogatory [stereotyping gets internalized
self-destructively by some]{.underline} victims of prejudice, [whereas
it is dismissively deflected by others]{.underline} (Block; Neville et
al.) --- not as a result of other people\'s attitudes but through the
agent\'s own transformative experiences, bias awareness building, role
models and the ability to dismiss the false consciousness of
colour-blind ideology (Neville, Viard, and Turner, \"Race and
Recognition\"). [A theoretical apparatus that]{.underline} invokes
[everyone belonging to a]{.underline}n historically [stigmatized social
group]{.underline} as [shar]{.underline}ing [an experience of oppression
which commits all of them to an indelible diminution of capacity
\"is]{.underline} arguably both [false and
counterproductive]{.underline}\" (Block 255).

Freeman observes this herself, in another footnote: \"[there is no such
thing as the Black experience]{.underline}\" (41 n. 8). She acknowledges
that [differences determined by]{.underline} circumstance ---
[class]{.underline}, [gender]{.underline}, [sexual
orientations]{.underline} --- [will yield very different
experiences]{.underline}:

> \[\... \] my phenomenology of racial oppression can apply to both
> Black men and Black women in that it can account for the ways in which
> their worlds can be constituted differently from one another at the
> same time from being constituted differently from white men and women
> \[sic\]. (Ibid.)

But again, the studies referred to here demonstrate that it is not by
virtue of their physical traits, class, or economic circumstance that
the abuse of being stigmatized and vilified is experienced differently
among those who are racially stereotyped. The empirical research shows
that individuals are hurt by negative stereotyping in varying degrees
depending upon how far they have freed themselves of the false
consciousness that they should be carrying the blame for it (Block;
Neville et al.). [This fact]{.underline} threatens again to [weigh
heavily on the claim that one unique ontological kind
exists]{.underline} for all embodiments of racial oppression rather than
indeterminately many, since none should be regarded as the definitive
prototype of experiencing this kind of harm.

Another way that Freeman highlights the experiential basis for this
ontological status is by elaborating the notion of objectifying oneself
in a repulsed way consistent with illicit public norms, discussed by
celebrated seminal advocates of positive black self-identity (and quoted
insightfully by Freeman: Du Bois; Fanon; Mills; Yancy). \"Double
consciousness is the prolonged experience or way of being in which one
views and understands oneself through the eyes of the oppressor\"
(\"Embodied Harm\" 653). But if the ontological kind unique to racial
oppression is defined solely by the experience of double consciousness,
then the question again arises whether only members can properly know
what it means to belong to that kind.

Can testimony ever be sufficient evidence to know what it is like to
have double consciousness without being oppressed by it oneself?
Knowledge by testimony would involve knowing by being told how the
oppressed sees herself as she imagines she is seen through the gaze of
the oppressor; and to know this sufficiently might require knowing what
it is like for the oppressed to see herself as one who knows now (having
told) that she is being seen to be seeing herself as she imagines she is
seen through the gaze of the oppressor; but once that gaze has been
adjusted in the light of this knowledge, then the oppressed may see
herself as she thinks she is seen differently by the oppressor seeing
her knowing that she is seen as seeing herself as she thinks the
oppressor sees her; and this might require that the oppressed adjust her
way of seeing herself as being seen by the oppressor whose gaze she may
believe or hope has been adjusted in light of what she has disclosed,
and so on. It appears that full disclosure of the knowledge required to
know who is a member of the onto-logical kind unique to racial
oppression threatens to collapse not only from the infinity of
reflections in two mirrors facing each other but also from the
infinitely expanding image as the mirrors ceaselessly recede from each
other to capture the growing content of what they are reflecting. Or,
more productively, the implication worth pursuing from testifying about
one\'s double consciousness may be that this kind of self-disclosure
cannot be conferred without the conferral itself having a transformative
effect on the informant, depending upon who it is that is receiving the
disclosure. This suggests that [the ontology of racial oppression is
dynamic and fluid]{.underline}, [not endemic and static]{.underline};
for [it can be changed from within by implicit attitudes and
actions]{.underline}, and interactions and reactions initiated by the
subjective agent. The reversal that Freeman speaks of is not dependent
wholly upon the attitudes of others who are in positions of indefensible
power to dismiss, reject and ignore. [Confrontation]{.underline},
[disclosure]{.underline}, [seeking role models and avoidance of the
white gaze]{.underline} altogether [may]{.underline} all [be different
paths]{.underline} suggesting others [to]{.underline} self-affirmation,
self-acceptance and [building a positive sense of black identity
despite]{.underline} the manifest conditions of [oppression]{.underline}
(Neville, Viard, and Turner, \"Race and Recognition\" 23). Psychological
studies by the leading researcher and theorist Helen A. Neville have
detailed the roles of colour evasion, power evasion and bias evasion
that sustain racial assumptions of undue entitlement and privilege, as
well as the many different journeys travelled by individuals distancing
themselves from still being targets of racial discrimination. This
cutting-edge work, together with [the wealth of empirical
data]{.underline} and theory it has inspired, [indicates there is no
basis for]{.underline} supposing that the very real disadvantages
incurred by some kinds of racial identity necessarily entail for anyone
[a fixed ontological status]{.underline} characterized by \"a bodily
comportment experienced as an \'I cannot\' as opposed to an \'I can\' \[
\... \]\" (Freeman, \"Embodied Harm\" 659).

Data Source

Data were retrieved from volunteer respondents to the Project Implicit
demonstration website
(https://implicit-harvard-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/), who provided
informed consent and selected either the Race, Sexuality, or Age IAT.
Data inclusion began January 1, 2007, and ended December 31, 2016; [for
a total of 10 years of data and 2,553,745 respondents]{.underline}. Only
U.S. respondents were included in the analyses, ensuring a sample with
shared understanding of the social categories of sexuality, race, and
age. Additionally, we only included respondents with complete IAT scores
(within the conditions of the revised scoring algorithm for the IAT;
Greenwald et al., 2003); complete explicit measures and complete
demographics of age, gender, race, political ideology, education, and
sexuality (for the Sexuality IAT). Demographics and sample sizes for
each Test are provided in Table 1.

Table 1 omitted.

Materials

The IAT (Greenwald et al., 1998) is a computerized Task comparing
reaction times to sort stimuli related to groups (e.g., old vs. young
people) and attributes (e.g., good vs. bad). Average response latencies
to sort the groups and attribute stimuli are compared across two blocks,
a societally congruent block (e.g., old/bad are sorted to the same side,
and young/good are sorted to the opposite side) and a societally
incongruent block (e.g., old/good vs. young/bad). Faster responses are
interpreted as stronger associations between the paired concepts.
Positive IAT D-scores reflect a pro-Young/anti-Old,
pro-White/anti-Black, or pro-Straight/anti-Gay attitude.

Analytic Strategy

Analytic Framework: ARIMA Time Series Models

As argued elsewhere (Charlesworth & Banaji, 2019) [investigating
patterns of long-term change in population-level data is best achieved
through autoregressive-integrated-moving-average]{.underline} (ARIMA)
[time-series models]{.underline} (Cryer & Chan, 2008; Jebb et al.,
2015). These models offer several advantages over linear multiple
regression approaches including that [they can]{.underline} (a)
[accommodate temporal autocorrelations]{.underline} (i.e., temporal
dependencies resulting from measures close in time being more similar
than measures far apart in time); (b) [address nonlinear patterns and
seasonal variation; and]{.underline} (c) offer [forecast]{.underline}s
about [future]{.underline} patterns of [change]{.underline}, providing
an intuitive index of how much change has occurred in the past as well
as the range of change that may occur in the future.

Identifying Parallel or Nonparallel Demographic Trends in Explicit and
Implicit Attitude Change

To identify parallel or nonparallel trends in implicit and explicit
social group attitudes we perform a two-step analysis. First, in line
with a wealth of research on demographic polarization (e.g., focusing on
ideological divergence; Fiorina & Abrams, 2008) we begin by examining
how the gap between the two demographic subgroups has changed (e.g., has
the difference between men and women's attitudes increased, decreased or
remained stable over time?). Second, we also test the individual
subgroup trajectories to investigate whether both subgroups reveal
trends in the same direction and at the same rate. The conclusions from
both steps generally converge (see Supplemental Table S5 in the online
supplemental material), indicating robust results. Finally, to further
support inference, we perform a supplemental analysis using generalized
least squares (GLS) regressions testing the interaction of demographic
subgroup-by-time (reported in Supplemental Tables S3 and S4). Even this
unique non ARIMA approach reveals convergent evidence with the observed
conclusions.

To give further detail on each of the steps: The first step in the
analyses is to examine the gap between two subgroups (e.g., male vs.
female) over time by subtracting the time series of one subgroup from
that of the relevant comparison subgroup (e.g., the time series for
women's attitudes is subtracted from the time series for men's
attitudes). ARIMA models are then fit to the demographic gap time series
using the automated forecasting algorithm implemented in the forecast
package in the R computing environment (Hyndman & Khandakar, 2008).

The demographic gap time series can reveal one of three patterns: (a)
remaining stable (either at neutral or above/below neutral), (b) moving
toward neutral (i.e., decreasing gap), or (c) moving away from neutral
(i.e., increasing gap). If the gap is stable, this indicates that the
two demographic subgroups have parallel trends (Patterns 1, 2, 3, and 4
in Figure 1). If, however, the gap is moving toward or away from neutral
this indicates that the subgroups have nonparallel trends (i.e., in
different rates or directions; Patterns 5, 6, and 7 in Figure 1).
Specifically, if the gap is moving toward neutral (Pattern 7), the
subgroups are converging over time (becoming more similar); if the gap
is moving away from neutral (Pattern 5 and 6 in Figure 1), the subgroups
are diverging over time (becoming more different). Formally, parallel
change is indicated by no differencing parameter in the ARIMA models
(i.e., p, 0, q), and forecasts that are hovering around neutrality,
indicating that the series is already stable. Nonparallel change is
indicated by the presence of a differencing parameter in the ARIMA model
(indicating a trend), as well as by forecasts that are not hovering
around neutrality. The results of all demographic gap series are
reported in Table 2 and visualized in the SM (Supplemental Figures S2
and S3 in the online supplemental material).

Trends in the Gap Between Demographic Subgroups for Implicit and
Explicit Age, Race, and Sexuality Attitudes

In the second step of the analyses, ARIMA models are fit to each
individual demographic subgroup time series (e.g., just to men's
attitudes and, separately, just to women's attitudes). Because we are
focused on whether the two subgroups reveal the same trends (i.e.,
change or remain stable at the same rate and in the same direction) we
focus on comparisons of the order of the differencing parameter in the
ARIMA models and the raw amount of change. Formally, parallel trends are
indicated when both subgroups have the same order of differencing
parameters and descriptively similar amounts of raw change. Nonparallel
trends are indicated when the two subgroups have different orders of
differencing parameters and/or descriptively different amounts of raw
change. Individual trajectories are visualized in Figures 2--5 and
reported in the SM (Supplemental Tables S1 and S2 in the online
supplemental material).

Finally, we also examine U.S. state differences in implicit and explicit
attitude change. However, because of the many differences in analytic
approaches (e.g., states cannot be summarized in binary comparisons to
create demographic "gaps"), geographic analyses are only summarized
briefly below but reported in detail in the in the online supplemental
material.

Controlling For Demographic Covariates and Sample Changes Over Time

In cross-sectional data, spurious attitude change could arise from
demographic changes in the sample over time (e.g., a sample becoming
increasingly liberal or female). Furthermore, observed demographic
differences across one demographic group (e.g., race) could actually be
due to differences along a correlated demographic group (e.g., political
orientation). To address both issues of sample change and demographic
covariates, we extended the weighting approach used by Charlesworth and
Banaji (2019). First, target weights were set for the demographic
representation of the whole sample over all time. Second, the sample was
split across the demographic subgroups of interest (e.g., into liberals
and conservatives) and subsequently split across years, yielding 10
yearly subsamples for each demographic subgroup (e.g., liberals in 2007,
2008, and so on through 2016; as well as conservatives in 2007, 2008,
and so on through 2016). Third, the yearly subsamples for each
demographic subgroup were weighted to effectively "match" the
demographic representations of the full sample over all time, thereby
controlling for both demographic covariates and demographic change. For
example, the weights ensured that the demographic representations of
liberals in 2007 approximated the demographic representations of
liberals or conservatives (on age, race, gender, and education) in any
other given year. Weighted monthly means were calculated for each
subgroup using the anesrake package in R (Pasek, 2016), and the
demographic gap time series was calculated by subtracting the two
weighted subgroup trajectories. Further details are provided in the
online supplemental materials. In addition, to ensure robustness, we
repeat all analyses but weighting only to yearly weights (not
demographic covariates); all conclusions remain consistent regardless of
weighting approach.

Results

Overview

[Across all attitude topics]{.underline} (age, [race,
sexuality]{.underline}) [and demographic subgroup
comparisons]{.underline} (e.g., male-female, White American-Black
American), we examined 32 demographic group comparisons for parallel
(Patterns 1--4, Figure 1) or nonparallel trends (Patterns 5--7, Figure
1).

Implicit Attitudes

By far the most frequent pattern for implicit age, race, and sexuality
attitudes was parallel trends, with 26/32 comparisons showing
demographic subgroups that were changing at similar rates and in similar
directions (see summary in Figure 1a and Table 2). That is, [most
demographic subgroups changed in parallel toward neutrality for implicit
race and sexuality attitudes]{.underline}, and most demographic
subgroups remained stable in parallel for implicit age attitudes. In
contrast, nonparallel trends, whether divergence (four of 32
comparisons) or convergence (two of 32 comparisons), were relatively
rare for implicit attitudes. Geographic differences in implicit attitude
change also revealed relatively narrow ranges of change as well as
significant rank-order stability, implying that most U.S. states were
changing or remaining stable in parallel. Theoretically, [this
suggests]{.underline} that [the sources of long-term change in
implicit]{.underline} age, [race, and sexuality attitudes are
likely]{.underline} to be [widespread phenomena, cutting across
demographics in similar ways]{.underline}.

As summarized in Figure 1a, the exceptions to this conclusion of
parallel change were as follows. First, Black versus White Americans (as
well as Black vs. Asian Americans) have converged over time on implicit
race attitudes, because Black Americans have maintained a weak, stable
pro-Black/anti-White implicit attitude, whereas White (and Asian)
Americans have moved in the direction of neutrality over time (moving
from a strong pro-White/anti-Black implicit attitude to a weaker
attitude). Second, younger versus older respondents and liberal versus
conservative respondents have diverged over time for both implicit race
and sexuality attitudes, with younger or liberal respondents generally
changing faster in the direction of neutrality than older or
conservative respondents. Younger or liberal subgroups may therefore be
uniquely receptive to, or exposed to, the current forces motivating
societal change (e.g., Krosnick & Alwin, 1989).

Explicit Attitudes

For [explicit]{.underline} age, [race, and sexuality
attitudes]{.underline} (summarized in Figure 1b and Table 2), the modal
pattern [was again parallel trends]{.underline} across demographic
subgroups (18 of 32 comparisons). However, relative to implicit
attitudes, more comparisons revealed nonparallel trends (10 of 32 showed
convergence and four of 32 showed divergence). This suggests that these
explicit attitudes are relatively more susceptible to the mezzo-level
influences of demographic-specific experiences and motivations (e.g.,
intergroup contact, SDO/SJ). In line with this interpretation, explicit
attitudes also showed relatively larger ranges of change across U.S.
states.

Together, these findings show that (a) implicit age, race, and sexuality
attitudes reveal surprising similarity in trends across most demographic
subgroups, with most groups changing in parallel toward neutrality
(i.e., decreasing bias) over the past decade; (b) two exceptions were
race differences for implicit race attitudes, as well as age and
political differences for implicit race and sexuality attitudes; and (c)
explicit attitudes also showed a modal pattern of parallel trends toward
attitude neutrality, but nevertheless revealed relatively more
nonparallel trends than implicit attitudes. Below, we elaborate on the
individual demographic comparisons; further details on all analyses are
provided throughout the online supplemental materials.

Gender Differences

On all three implicit attitudes, the trends of men and women's attitudes
have moved in parallel, in the same direction and at similar rates over
time (Figure 2 and Supplemental Table S1 in the online supplemental
material). Thus, the gap between men and women's implicit age, race, and
sexuality attitudes has remained stable over the past decade and is not
forecast to converge in the future. In contrast, for explicit attitudes,
men and women's attitudes have converged over time (Figure 2 and
Supplemental Table S2). Indeed, the ARIMA forecasts indicate that gender
differences on explicit race, age, and sexuality attitudes could
converge as early as 2020, 2025, and 2028, respectively. Such
convergence is the result of men shifting toward attitude neutrality by
greater amounts than women: for race, age, sexuality attitudes,
respectively, men's raw change = .17, .20, .50 points and women's raw
change = .08, .17, .32 points (Supplemental Table S2).

model forecast. IAT = Implicit Association Test. See the online article

Race Differences: White Versus Asian Americans, White Versus Black
Americans, and Asian Versus Black Americans

For all implicit attitudes, White and Asian Americans revealed parallel
trends over the past decade (Supplemental Table S1 in the online
supplemental material and Table 2). Similarly, for all explicit
attitudes, White and Asian Americans had parallel trends over time
(Supplemental Table S2 and Table 2). Thus, when it comes to evaluating
groups defined by age, sexuality, or Black/White racial groups, White
and Asian Americans appear to be shaped by similar macrolevel forces
over time.

A different pattern emerges when contrasting the attitudes of Black and
White Americans. Although Black and White Americans revealed parallel
trends on implicit age and sexuality attitudes (Figure 3; Supplemental
Table S1; and Table 2), they have converged over time on implicit race
attitudes. This convergence is due to faster change toward neutrality
among White Americans (who started at an IAT D-score of .40 and
decreased in pro-White/anti-Black attitudes by .06 points) and relative
stability among Black Americans, who maintained a weak
pro-Black/anti-White implicit attitude (no measurable change around IAT
D-scores of −.08 to −.09; Supplemental Table S1). Identical patterns
emerged for the comparison of Asian and Black Americans: Asian and Black
Americans revealed parallel trends on both implicit age and sexuality
attitudes but converging trends on implicit race attitudes because of
faster change toward attitude neutrality among Asian Americans and
stable, weak pro-Black/anti-White implicit attitudes among Black
Americans.

Figure 3 omitted.

Figure 3. Note. See figure caption to Figure 2. IAT = Implicit
Association Test. See the online article for the color version of this
figure.

Given that White and Asian Americans have moved in the direction of more
neutral implicit attitudes (i.e., in the direction of
pro-Black/anti-White implicit attitudes), why did Black Americans not
also move in the direction of pro-Black/anti-White implicit attitudes,
especially given that this would be in the direction of greater ingroup
preference? Theoretically, the stable but weak implicit ingroup
preferences among Black Americans aligns with previous research
suggesting a limit to implicit ingroup preference when such preferences
go against the persistent status hierarchy (e.g., Axt et al., 2014;
Dunham et al., 2014). In other words, there may be a limit to Black
Americans' implicit ingroup preferences (i.e., implicit
pro-Black/anti-White attitudes) because of internalized associations of
Black-bad/White-good that are embedded in systemic collective
representations.

Similar results were observed for explicit attitudes: White and Black
Americans moved in parallel on sexuality attitudes but both explicit age
and race attitudes showed demographic convergence between White and
Black Americans (as well as between Asian and Black Americans). For
explicit race attitudes, the gap is converging rapidly because both
White (and Asian) Americans and Black Americans are changing toward
neutrality, but from opposite directions. Specifically, White Americans
have decreased in their explicit pro-White/anti-Black preference by .18
points, and similarly, Asian Americans have decreased their explicit
pro-White/anti-Black preference by .22 points, showing a trend downward.
In contrast, Black Americans have decreased in their explicit
pro-Black/anti-White preference by .28 points (Supplemental Table S2 in
the online supplemental material), showing a trend upward.

Education Differences

For all implicit attitudes, education subgroups (\<college education,
college education) moved in parallel (Supplemental Table S1 and Table
2). Identical findings emerged for explicit attitudes (Supplemental
Table S2). Although such a result may be initially surprising, similar
conclusions are obtained in representative samples, where all education
subgroups are changing in parallel on beliefs about race and sexuality
(see Key Trends in General Social Survey, 2019).

Religion Differences: Nonreligious, Christian, Jewish, Other Religions

For all implicit attitudes, all religious subgroup comparisons indicated
parallel trends over the past decade, with gaps between most religions
indicating only small baseline differences, and forecasts that hovered
around neutrality (Supplemental Table S1). Identical findings emerged
for explicit attitudes, with all religious subgroups revealing parallel
trends toward neutrality for all attitudes (Supplemental Table S1). This
result may seem counterintuitive given previous literature showing how
religion shapes social opinions over time (e.g., abortion, Evans, 2002).
It is possible that religion may shape change in religion-relevant
attitudes/opinions (e.g., abortion) but not so in intergroup attitudes
that are not immediately applicable to religious discussions (e.g.,
race, age). Further, it is possible that the decreasing centrality of
religion in U.S. life (Gallup, 2017; Pew Research Center, 2015) may lead
to a decreasing role of religious identity in how social attitudes
change.

Sexuality Differences

On implicit sexuality attitudes , all sexual orientations, whether
straight, lesbian/gay, or bisexual respondents, revealed parallel trends
toward more pro-Gay/anti-Straight attitudes (although there were
baseline differences in magnitude; Supplemental Table S1). Nevertheless,
for explicit sexuality attitudes, although all groups were again moving
toward more progay/antistraight attitudes, the trends were nonparallel.
Specifically, there was convergence because straight respondents
decreased at a faster rate (changing by .36 points) than either
lesbian/gay or bisexual respondents (changing by .11 and .12 points,
respectively; Supplemental Table S2).

Age Differences

A unique pattern of nonparallel implicit attitude change emerged for age
comparisons. First, within implicit attitudes, younger respondents (\<20
years old at time of test) and older respondents (\>40 years old at time
of test) have diverged on implicit sexuality attitudes and, somewhat
less consistently, on implicit race attitudes (see Figure 4). This
divergence is because younger respondents have changed faster than older
respondents. Specifically, younger respondents have decreased by .15 and
.06 IAT points on implicit sexuality and race attitudes, respectively,
whereas older respondents have decreased by only .07 and .04 IAT points
(Supplemental Table S1). Moreover, both implicit race and sexuality
attitudes have actually flipped the sign of their age differences over
time, with younger respondents initially more biased, but now less
biased, than older respondents. In contrast, for implicit age attitudes,
younger and older respondents have both shown stable pro-Young/anti-Old
preferences over the past decade. Thus, ingroup preference motivations
do not appear to activate faster movement toward pro-Old/anti-Young
preferences among elderly respondents, perhaps as a result of
internalized collective representations that value "youth" (Axt et al.,
2014).

Figure 4 omitted.

Figure 4. Note. For further details see figure caption to Figure 2. IAT
= Implicit Association Test. See the online article for the color
version of this figure.

For all explicit attitudes, younger respondents have revealed faster
trends toward neutrality than older respondents (see Figure 4): younger
respondents have decreased in bias by .17, .18, and .46 points on
explicit age, race, and sexuality attitudes, respectively, while older
respondents have decreased in bias by only .08, .07, and .24 explicit
points (less than half the raw change of younger respondents;
Supplemental Table S2). Thus, across the board, age differences on all
but one attitude (implicit age attitudes) indicate nonparallel trends
across time.

Political Differences

Political groups have revealed nonparallel trends for both implicit race
and sexuality attitudes, with an increasing (diverging) gap between the
two groups over time. This divergence is due to more rapid change among
the initially less-biased liberal respondents (decreasing by .15 and .07
IAT points for sexuality and race attitudes, respectively) and
relatively slower change toward attitude neutrality among the
more-biased conservative respondents (decreasing by .07 and .04 IAT
points; Figure 5 and Supplemental Table S1). It is nevertheless worth
noting that, for implicit race and sexuality attitudes, both liberal and
conservative respondents show trends in the direction of neutrality,
just at different rates.

Figure 5 omitted.

Figure 5. Note. For further details see figure caption to Figure 2. IAT
= Implicit Association Test. See the online article for the color
version of this figure.

For explicit attitudes, liberals and conservatives reveal nonparallel
trends for all three attitudes. For explicit race attitudes, liberals
have changed faster (decreased by .17 points) than conservatives
(decreased by .11 points), resulting in divergence across time. For
explicit age and sexuality attitudes, however, conservatives have
changed faster toward neutrality (decreased by .20 and .44 points for
age and sexuality attitudes, respectively) than liberals (decreased by
.12 and .34 points; Supplemental Table S2 and Figure 5). Thus, on
explicit age and sexuality attitudes, the political gap is, perhaps
surprisingly, converging over time.

Geographic Differences

All implicit attitudes indicated relatively limited geographic
variability in rates of change over time (see individual states listed
in Supplemental Tables S10.1--10.8 and interactive visuals at
https://outsmartinghumanminds.org/interactive/change-timelapse/index.html).
It is particularly notable that, for implicit sexuality attitudes, every
single U.S. state has moved toward neutrality over the past decade,
reinforcing the surprisingly broad spread of change across people and
places. Moreover, U.S. states revealed significant and high rank-order
stability for implicit sexuality and race attitudes, suggesting that the
states are largely changing in parallel and maintaining their
rank-ordering (Supplemental Table S9). Explicit attitudes, in contrast,
revealed greater variability in the rate and direction of change across
states (Supplemental Table S9).

General Discussion

Across three social group attitude topics (age, race, and sexuality) and
a total of 32 demographic group comparisons (e.g., men vs. women, old
vs. young, liberal vs. conservative) as well as all U.S. states, we
report the first comprehensive record of demographic patterns of
implicit and explicit attitude change over a decade (2007--2016). In so
doing, we offer insights into the nature of long-term, societal-level
change in implicit and explicit social cognition. We show that (a)
long-term change in implicit age, race, and sexuality attitudes appears
to be widespread, with parallel trends toward attitude neutrality (i.e.,
decreasing bias) across most demographic groups; (b) exceptions to this
pattern are age and politics, where younger and liberal respondents
revealed faster trends toward neutrality than older and conservative
respondents; and (c) explicit attitudes revealed more nonparallel trends
(with demographic groups changing toward neutrality at differing rates
across time), although explicit attitudes also revealed a modal pattern
of parallel change toward neutrality. In addition, we illustrate a
methodological approach for identifying demographic differences within
large-scale cross-sectional temporal data, a setting that will become
increasingly frequent in this era of big data.

Implicit Attitude Trends Largely Unfold in Parallel Across Groups

For implicit social group attitudes, the majority (26 of 32) of
demographic comparisons revealed that the trends of demographic
subgroups have changed, or remained stable, in parallel over the past
decade. Parallel implicit attitude change occurred even regardless of
baseline differences in subgroups' implicit attitude magnitude (e.g.,
women consistently had lower implicit attitudes than men, but both men
and women consistently changed in parallel). This finding is perhaps
surprising, as it stands in contrast to the prediction that differences
in attitude magnitude correspond to differences in change (Charlesworth
& Banaji, 2019; Petty & Krosnick, 1995). Perhaps, the relationship
between attitude magnitude and change may not apply when looking at
aggregated demographics, although further explorations are necessary.

[Overall, the results suggest]{.underline} that, whatever the rate or
direction of change/stability, [implicit attitude change is occurring at
the macrolevel of society]{.underline}. This conclusion aligns with the
"bias of crowds" theory (Payne et al., 2017), which proposes that
implicit attitudes can be interpreted as products of societal
environments. Thus, as societal environments change, so too will
implicit attitudes transform across a wide range of demographic groups.
Although this model was principally derived to explain implicit attitude
magnitude, the current results suggest an important extension to the
model: Implicit attitude change is also likely a product of the
macrolevel, rather than the mezzo-level of demographic groups. Given
this result, future research is poised to identify which macrolevel
variables are at play, whether widespread exposure to ecological
stressors (e.g., pathogen threat, Grossmann & Varnum, 2015; Varnum &
Grossmann, 2017b), legislations (e.g., Ofosu et al., 2019); mainstream
media (e.g., Ravary et al., 2019); and/or social norms (Jackson et al.,
2019).

That implicit attitudes are found to change at the macrolevel is
particularly notable in the current social moment of 2020 when massive
macrolevel events, including the Covid-19 global pandemic and the
large-scale Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, are shaping our daily
lives. These macrolevel phenomena have the potential to profoundly
reshape attitude trajectories across wide swaths of the population. For
instance, increases in pathogen threats from the Covid-19 pandemic may
ultimately reverse the trends we observed toward attitude neutrality
(since pathogen threats are correlated with trends in social attitudes;
Inbar et al., 2016; Varnum & Grossmann, 2017b). On the other hand, [the
surprisingly widespread approval of BLM across]{.underline} various
[cross-sections of society]{.underline} (Cohn & Quealy, 2020) [points to
the possibility that implicit attitudes (and especially race attitudes)
may continue to shift toward more neutral and equitable
attitudes]{.underline}. Ultimately, only time can tell what impact these
macrolevel phenomena will have on the implicit and explicit attitudes of
our society. For now, what is clear is this: [Although many social
attitudes]{.underline} and opinions [are found to change
slowly]{.underline} or idiosyncratically across society (Rosenfeld,
2017), [the current data suggest]{.underline} that [social
attitudes]{.underline}, and especially implicit social group attitudes,
[can]{.underline}, under the right conditions, also [reveal widespread
transformations over the span of just a single decade]{.underline}.

**BARLOW 16** - Michael Barlow, 2016, graduated in 2016 with a Bachelors
degree in Sociology from United States Military Academy at West Point in
West Point, NY. "Addressing Shortcomings in Afro-Pessimism"
http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1435/2/addressing-shortcomings-in-afro-pessimism//vi

While the [ontological state of Black social death is an important
concept for resistance scholars to understand]{.underline}, the [typical
advocacy of **complete** societal pessimism in response to that
ontological arrangement **is incomplete at best**.]{.underline} Many in
Afro-Pessimism use the basis of social death to determine the question
of Black political orientation in a way that is problematic. [This is
not to say that social death theorization is not important, but that
there is a vital distinction that needs to be made both in terms of its
application toward traditional political processes and ensembles of
Blackness.]{.underline} Frank Wilderson, Associated Professor of
African-American Studies and Drama at the University of
California-Irvine, is quite possibly the leading Afro-Pessimist scholar.
He concludes his discussion of social death by advocating for one to
"embrace its disorder, its incoherence, and allow oneself to be
elabo­rated by it if, indeed, ones politics are to be underwritten by a
desire to take down this country" (2007). In summary, his application of
social death is used as a reason why Black life cannot be oriented at
any level of meaningful production within society[. While Wilderson is
correct that the material labor and symbolic currency born out of
Blackness will always be consumed by whiteness, his conclusion is
**paradoxical** at some level. **If humanism is the grammar by which
civil society determines the register of subjectivity, why then is that
matrix appropriate in determining the state of Black life**, if Black
life is inherently the position of what is incommunicable? If social
death theory's application is one that concludes an impossibility of
meaningful Black productivity, then Afro-Pessimism becomes nothing but a
body of literature that echoes the same sentiments as those who would
understand Black life as a state of nothingness]{.underline} in plain
racist terms[. Understanding Black ontology should definitely involve an
understanding of the social deadness of the Black subject in relation to
society, but it should n**ot be used as the standard to measure internal
liberation**]{.underline}. The [distinction here is important because
too often Afro-Pessimists scholars like Wilderson conceptualize Black
resistance as a singular orientation toward society]{.underline}. Indeed
their work is important to understand the manner in which society
operates upon Black subjects, but [it is insufficient to describe an
ethic that allows for the **pursuit of meaning within Blackness
itself**. In this regard, scholars should understand Black resistance as
occurring on two different levels: the **ontological and the
intra-ontological**.]{.underline} The [distinction being made is between
the ontological state of Blackness as determined **outside of humanity
proper versus** the life within the ontological state of **Blackness as
understood through social death.**]{.underline} If social death is the
state of the Black, what then speaks to the state of the Black amongst
Blacks? It would be a mistake on the part of any scholar to concern
themselves with one and not the other. This paper uses the term
intra-ontology in reference to the varying ontologies within social
death. This is the Black among Blacks. These are those spaces within
Blackness that only the Black can ever understand or occupy. [Though
they exist outside of the production of the human (within the category
of social death), there are Black affektual politics]{.underline} that
have been with the slave since the ship. These are [the emotional and
spiritual ontologies within Blackness that connected slaves of different
lands, languages, and religions into one community]{.underline}. Black
intra-ontology can never achieve the plane of recognition because it can
only be understood within Blackness, which by definition is the position
of social death, but those affektual spirits and emotions ought not be
neglected. [Social death should guide Black resistance strategy in
understanding the position of the Black within civil society, but it
**speaks not to the arrangement of Black intra-ontological questions.**
If this is measured by social death it only produces a cycle of endless
internal psychic violence because the Black would only be met with the
discovery of a violent reality of its existence through affirmations of
social death. Intra-ontological resistance must not be a question of how
the world understands Blackness, because the position of the slave is
one that cannot be articulated in terms of hegemony.]{.underline} If it
is so that the Black inherently experiences the world through a
different ontological register, [then measures of Black liberation
cannot be articulated through the lens of humanist
grammars.]{.underline} Jared Sexton, the Director of the
African-American Studies School of Humanities at the University of
California-Irvine, is another leading scholar in Afro-pessimism. He
explains that there is indeed social life that exists within social
death. There are many that condemn the invocation of social death as
overly pessimistic, but "this acceptance or affirmation is active; it is
a willing or willingness, in other words, to pay whatever social costs
accrue to being black, to inhabiting blackness, to living a black social
life under the shadow of social death. This is not an accommodation to
the dictates of the antiblack world" (Sexton 2010). This is [to say that
it is indeed possible to both affirm the state of social death and
actively pursue the social life that exists within
Blackness]{.underline}. This is not the typical critique of social
death, but rather it is a necessary specification of the social life
within social death that Sexton speaks. Social death is adequate in
terms of measuring the ontological state of the human versus the Black,
but a [different rubric is required in mapping social life within social
death.]{.underline} One such rubric is fleshly politics. This concepts
derives from the plantation in regards to the manner in which slaves
would temporarily reclaim and weaponize their bodies as a site of
political protest against their state of enslavement. Fleshy politics is
an example of an appropriate rubric for measuring liberation within
intra-ontological politics because these bodily resistances surely did
not change the physical state of enslavement, but it did immeasurable
good for the mental and psychological state of those in the master's
cage. Alternate orientations to the flesh "excavates the social
(after)life of these categories: it represents racializing assemblages
of subjection that can never annihilate the lines of flight, freedom
dreams, practices of liberation, and possibilities of other worlds"
(Weheliye 2014). In contrast to Wilderson's line of flight away from
bodily coding, it is important to reclaim the atrocity of the flesh as a
means of agency within capture through the remapping of whiteness. The
enslaved female flesh was the site of great violence, but there is a
false "dichotomy between the material/political and the personal, in
large measure \[because even though the\] body, so deeply personal, is
also a political arena. Their work has demonstrated the extent to which
women\'s bodies were unique sites of domination under slavery" (Camp
2002). Though the body was in the possession of the slave master, the
enslaved found personal meaning in its temporary recapture in
fleshliness which satisfied an innate desire for selfhood. The
illegality of using the flesh as a site of pleasure became a political
counter-investment. While conventional Afro-Pessimist would argue that
this personal orientation does nothing in terms of the ontological
position within Blackness, the personal victory the enslaved experiences
as a result of that temporary reclamation is meaningful in both
psychological and emotional terms. [This is important because if there
is never room for personal liberation, and Black resistance is only
understood in terms of material questions within civil society, it
reproduces the same sacrificial logic that social death explains.
Resistance strategies that only take meaning in notions of full agency
are recipes for failure because these only measure Black liberation on
the register of civil society which can never grapple with the inherent
confine in which Black life exists]{.underline}. Balancing Ontological
versus Intra-Ontological To take the conclusion of the previous section
and use the call from intra-ontological liberation as a justification
for the ontological state of Blackness would be a violent imposition of
whiteness. [The arrangement of Blackness as an ontological question
versus Blackness as an intra-ontological question is a criminalization
of Black thought. The two are not mutually exclusive, nor should one be
viewed as a sufficient substitute for the other. Instead, they are
complimentary; they are necessary components to the assemblage of Black
resistance strategy.]{.underline} for free political autonomy absent
British restrictions, there is also a less told narrative. Early desires
for Manifest Destiny began not with the Constitution of the United
States but with the pressures of the early American state to explore
Native lands out West in order to take those lands as their own. They
felt as though limiting themselves to the eastern shores deprived them
of a natural right to own territory occupied by the Natives, and when
the British government denied these desires for further colonial
expansionism, it fuelled war tensions (James 2007). This trend is also
true for slavery, and the American Civil War is an example. The
maintenance of Slavery played a pivotal role in fuelling the American
Civil War. Southern States wanted to continue the institution of slavery
in new states admitted into the Union, and when this was denied, it
fuelled the outbreak of the Civil War. These desires for empire not only
created America, but they also sustained it through more war. This is
why there exists an antagonistic relationship between the slave and
civil society. The Black relationship to the United States, and really
western civil society writ large, has always been one defined through
violent terms. The very being of the Black comes to be in the world
through the active colonial murder of the African. Often it is forgotten
that Black itself is not an identity that it denoted by a specific
topography or practice, but rather it is known through constructionist
conceptions that are projected upon, and not by it. The case is a simple
one; "Give Turtle Island back to the \"Savage." Give life itself back to
the Slave. Two simple sentences, fourteen simple words, and the
structure of U.S. (and perhaps global) antagonisms would be dismantled"
(Wilderson 2010). Slavery provided not only the economic means for which
the United States to produce itself, but it provided the map by which it
could exist culturally and socially as well. If the United States was
founded upon the genocide of the indigenous and the death of the
African, then how can it ever be an ethical entity? It is not, and it
should not be the end-point of Black political emancipation. Black
movements in particular should abandon the United States as a source of
hope because of the antagonistic relationship that it has with civil
society. In terms ontological positioning, the ultimate point of freedom
for the Black subject is the disorganization of society's operation upon
Black flesh because "for Black people, civil society itself- rather than
its abuses or shortcomings - is a state of emergency" (Wilderson 2003).
The power dynamic in the status quo exists as such through the
continuous destructive consumption of the Black. Obviously, chattel
slavery has ended but the slave relationship the Black has with the
United States, and the world as a whole, is unchanged. In every major
institution, Black bodies experience oppression and inequality at a
systemic level. From ailing educational structures in overly
impoverished neighborhoods, to the state of mass incarceration, Black
subjects in America are targeted and subjected to overwhelming
discrimination and abuse in every field. This is no coincidence. Recent
theorizations have even gone as far as to identify the state of mass
incarceration as the newest era of Black enslavement. Though not on the
plantation, there is a case to be made that the slavery now exists in
"the mass incarceration of people of color. Although African American
men comprise less than seven percent of the population, they comprise
half of the prison and jail population. Today, one out of three African
American men is either in prison, on probation, or on parole" (Alexander
2006). This pattern of surveillance, restriction, and destruction of
Black bodies is the very same process of enslavement from the
plantation. This has been and continues to be the truth of Black life in
western civilization since the dawning of the Middle Passage. Now, there
are a myriad of liberal scholars who will point to sentimental hollow
policies such as the Civil Rights Act to make the case for why the state
of Black oppression is getting better. While the form of Black slavery
has definitely changed and become more nuanced in its application, the
foundational truth of said slavery remains unchanged. The question
remains of how to create consistency in ontological and
intra-ontological resistance. [Is it materially possible to both call
for a disruption of civil society while finding points of productivity
in society? The answer is yes, at the margins.]{.underline} It is here
that this paper makes another substantive departure from conventional
pessimistic theorization, and again, it is useful to refer to
Wilderson's work. His theorization of the Black's antagonistic
relationship with the world concludes that the world is parasitic on
Black life. Thus, he forwards the end of the world as the only ethical
alternative. Afro-Pessimists are often criticized for their highly
theoretical abstraction with this concept. Though there are no explicit
specifications of what the end of the world is or how Black resistance
movements are to specifically get there, it is widely accepted that the
position is more of an epistemic orientation rather than one that
forwards literal destruction. In addition, Wilderson calls for Black
refusal to engage in civil society in an unflinching paradigmatic
analysis meaning that any form of engagement with civil society would
require Black abjection. This is the point of friction that this paper
seeks to address. [Even though Black bodies stand in an antagonistic
relationship to the world, there needs to be a distinction made. The
notion that any level of stability within civil society affirms Black
Death has two major problems. First, it produces the exact same pattern
of ressentiment which reproduces the internalization of self-hate which
only sets the stage for communal violence in an attempt to cleanse. If
the standard for measuring the effectiveness of Black movements is the
destruction of every part of society, then failure is the only
appropriate descriptor for every Black resistance strategy in history.
If this is the case, the internalization of Black slaveness becomes all
but inevitable by reinforcing psychological, mental, and emotional
chains of depression on all those who seek to resistance. The second
problem is that Black bodies have no means of creating instability at
the state or societal level. Society is a manifestation of hundreds of
years of economic and political accumulation that has yielded countless
weapons against the oppressed.]{.underline} [Simply expecting the
dominant order to forgo the use of those weapons is a fantasy. The scope
of orienting towards the end of the world in terms of instability is far
too large. The end of the world is not possible. Afro-Pessimism is far
too separated from the material practice of resistance in this
regard.]{.underline} If the justification for detaching from state
involvement is that it requires a sacrificing of Black flesh, then
resistance strategies must consider the effect of a complete embrace of
political refusal. Calls for absolute Black pessimism is also an
abjection of Black flesh in the same manner Wilderson bases the need for
the end of the world because an open refusal and rejection to at least
seemingly conform to degrees of social norms will have deadly
consequences for Black bodies. For pessimists to call for Blacks to
openly embrace physical death in pursuit of theory is irresponsible and
unethical. [Wilderson uses the question of flinching as a misnomer. The
term seems to suggest that any participation in or any implicit
affirmation of society is an insufficient Black politic]{.underline}.
The problem is that at its core the very nature of Black life is one
that requires a series of strategic and tactical flinches. This means
that in different situations and settings, Black bodies take different
forms. [If confronted on the street by a racist police officer, asking
for one to unconditionally refuse to recognize the position of the
officer is in turn asking for Black suicidal politics.]{.underline} As
posited above, there is something inherently valuable within Black
intra-ontological arrangements, and as such, suicide is a non-starter.
Not only is this a strategy for sustaining intra-ontological freedom,
[but it is also a strategy for pursuing the disorganization of civil
society. It problematizes society's ability to easily script the nature
of Black life and Black resistance. Tactical flinches allow Blackness to
become a thousand different villains disguised as citizens. It is a
protective mechanism for those who seek to fight against tyranny without
inciting the wrath of the tyrannical. This is not to say that Black
resistance should ever flinch in its orientation to civil society at a
fundamental level. It is to say that in order for Black life to exist in
a world that wishes its death, it is necessary to disguise that
orientation and strategically present it in certain settings. Some will
be highly critical of this notion because it will be perceived as a call
to sacrifice expressions of authentic self in an appeasement of the
dominant order. Instead, this is a call to reassess the very
understanding of political orientation. Black resistance should embody
refusal at the core level; that should be internalized, and it is the
very process of mystifying that core refusal in acts of fugitive
transgressions against civil society that renders its violence
inoperable.]{.underline} This is not a sacrifice of the authentic self,
but the mystification and protection of authentic Blackness in an act of
rebellion against societal production of anti-Black violence. This is an
effective means of navigating Black ontological questions. Again, Black
liberation cannot be measured in terms of the absence of white violence,
but it must be measured using different rubrics. In terms of Black
ontological resistance as an ensemble, this resistance is a question is
the maintenance of Black communities through the inoperability of
violence by complicating perceptions of Black criminality. Since the
slave has no capacity to orchestrate the manifestation of the end of the
world, then Black orientation to the end of the world must begin with
one of constructing the illegality of the body. This is the means in
which Black movements must employ fleshly politics in modern resistance
strategies. [The end of the world should not be understood through the
instability of civil society or the state, but rather, it should be
understood through the ability of Black communities to render themselves
self-sufficient which should very well include a strategic and criminal
relationship with civil society.]{.underline}

#### Afropess is too totalizing theory of power \-- it doesn't account for individual experiences

\"Against Afropessimism,\" IDEOLOGY THEORY PRACTICE,
https://www.ideology-theory-practice.org/blog/against-afropessimism//vi

Afropessimists argue that we can only understand the global system of
racial domination if we acknowledge that it is, first and foremost, a
system defined in toto by anti-blackness. Moreover, Afropessimism
rejects a central role for political economy and politics for
understanding the essence of black oppression. For the past few years,
this branch of critical race theory has gained a number of supporters in
and out of the academy. For example, Frank Wilderson's highly
influential 2020 book Afropessimism was long-listed for the National
Book Award and was praised by several outstanding black intellectuals.
This essay centres the work of Frank Wilderson and Jared Sexton as they
are widely recognised leaders of the Afropessimism school of
thought.\[1\] Wilderson and Sexton claim that the enslavement of
Africans constituted a rupture; a rupture that was essential for the
development of capitalism but also a rupture that put black bodies and
black people outside of the logics of capitalism and colonialism. For
Sexton and Wilderson, anti-blackness is both a unique system of
structural dominance as well as an ideology. Anti-blackness, they claim,
is defined by racial slavery and impervious to change. Sexton argues for
example, "the application of the law of racial slavery is pervasive,
regardless of variance or permutation in its operation across the better
part of a millennium".\[2\] In this essay, I offer a critique of
Afropessimism, both as a theory of black oppression and as a political
project. I make the following claims. [First, Afropessimism incorrectly
centres the experiences of people of African descent that were
**enslaved within the U.S.** This **results in the homogenisation of the
experiences** of peoples of African descent]{.underline}, and, equally
importantly, mischaracterises and belittles the oppression of
non-African colonised subjects. [While I agree that anti-blackness is a
central structural feature of global white supremacy that emerged with
the mid-15th-century Iberian slave trade, I argue that it is not the
only critical structural feature that historically defined white
supremacy.]{.underline} Further, the ontological centring of the
experiences of people of African descent in the U.S. radically and
incorrectly homogenises the history and conditions of the peoples of
Africa and those in the African Diaspora. Secondly, I argue that
Afropessimists overemphasise the continuities in the black experience in
the U.S. While Afropessimists are correct that there are structural
continuities across time that continue to contribute to black
oppression---not the least of which is a continuing vitriolic and
violent global anti-blackness---they underemphasise the achievements of
black freedom struggles. [Even Wilderson's own biography is a testimony
to critical changes in the black experience in the U.S. The **positive
changes** that are elided in the work of many Afropessimists---such as
the formation of modern **black civil society** and a great expansion of
a robust and often revolutionary black politics--- serves to **erase**
the often heroic struggles of black activists; struggles that often
tragically failed to bring substantial progress, but that also sometimes
achieved victories in the struggle for black liberation. Finally, and
critically, Wilderson and Sexton present a fatally flawed account of the
**relationship between black oppression, white supremacy** and the
capitalist social order.]{.underline} I will demonstrate that this is a
flaw that not only makes impossible any accurate account of black
oppression, but also prevents us from understanding the contradictions
and cleavages that exist within black communities and black politics.
[Afropessimism Incorrectly Centres the Experiences of People of African
Descent Enslaved within the U.S. Afro-Pessimists homogenise the black
experience. I]{.underline} agree with Wilderson when he argues that the
enslavement of blacks, and specifically the slave trade, was a condition
for the development of global capitalism, particularly as the Atlantic
became more economically important than the Mediterranean.\[3\] The
large-scale sale of Africans in 1444 by the Portuguese marked Africans
as the Other, justifying in the minds of royal, religious, and secular
Portuguese elites the brutal and exceptional enslavement of Africans.
Previously, only prisoners of war were subject to enslavement. This
marked the moment when Africans were marked as the exception to natural
law in service of accumulation; in service of profits.\[4\] I also agree
with Wilderson that this marks the inception of a set of anti-black
logics that have taken a life of their own and have rendered black lives
less valuable, subject to excessive and often arbitrary violence, and
ultimately disposable during the entire history of capitalist
development. I disagree, however, when Sexton and Wilderson privilege
the role of enslaved Africans and their descendants in the "New World"
and homogenise the black experience. They fail to understand that black
people have played a number of roles viz colonialism and have been
valued differently by capitalist states and managers depending on those
roles.\[5\] Sexton's claim "\[t\]he United States provides the point of
focus here, but the dynamics under examination are not restricted to its
bounds" glosses over the differences in black experience at the time of
slavery and the present day, and between "New World slavery" and
old-world colonialism.\[6\] It assumes that the figure of the enslaved
African in the "New World" can represent the entirety of black
experience. This is untenable: After all, one might well argue that the
experience of colonised Africans was more akin to that of the other
colonised populations of Asia and the "New World" than that of their
enslaved cousins. The work of scholars such as Michael Ralph and Andrew
Zimmerman, among many others, demonstrate that those enslaved in the so-
called "New World" was not the same, for example, as the experience of
Africans in Senegambia who worked as agents on behalf of European
colonial powers.\[7\] Further, these Afropessimists incorrectly belittle
the oppression of non-white peoples who are not of African descent. If
the threat and shadow of slavery followed those of African descent
across generations, the very real threat of dispossession, massacre and
even genocide at the hands of Euro-American imperialists and their
clients similarly hung over entire indigenous populations across
multiple continents and islands. But Afropessimists deny this. Sexton,
for example, argues that with respect to black folks, indigenous
populations had the same relationship to people of African descent as
the Europeans that colonised the western hemisphere, Asia, and Africa.
Sexton argues, "freedom from the rule of slave law requires only that
one be considered nonblack, whether that nonblack racial designation be
"white" or "Indian" or, in the rare case, "Oriental"---this despite the
fact that each of these groups has at one point or another laboured in
conditions similar to or contiguous with enslaved African-derived
groups."\[8\] In other words, Sexton here argues that modern racial
slavery was so momentous than even the indigenous victims of genocide,
or the conquered colonised peoples throughout the world, had more in
common with whites than they had in common with enslaved African
populations and their descendants---even though arguably colonised
Africans had more in common with other colonised peoples than with their
enslaved cousins in the Western Hemisphere. Sexton declares, "we note
the fact that 'the absolute submission mandated by law was not simply
that of slave to his or her owner- but the submission of all the
enslaved before all whites. The latter group is better termed all non
blacks (or, less economically, the unequally arrayed category of
non-blackness), because it is racial blackness as a necessary condition
for enslavement that matters most, rather than whiteness as a condition
for freedom."\[9\] Even bracketing the historical inaccuracies, the
logical and temporal slippage in the above passages that lead to the
transformation from "enslaved before all whites" to "better termed non
blacks" is stunning. The genocide of indigenous peoples in the New World
preceded black slavery and was in many ways as or more brutal even if
the dehumanisation processes markedly differed. Nine out of ten
indigenous people died due to European diseases in the New World---yet
that category was a condition for freedom? The American empire as well
as that of its European counterparts required periodic massacres of
racialised "natives" at places such as Sand Creek and Wounded Knee, or
in the early 20th century, the Philippines where an extraordinary
percentage of the population was killed during the American military
intervention before World War I. In his work on racialised U.S.
imperialism in the Philippines, Kramer calls estimates of 250,00
Filipinos dying as a result of U.S. military intervention during the
late 19th early 20th century "conservative".\[10\] Massacres such as
these were conducted by from Southern to Northern African by brutal
imperialists such as the Germans and British. To sum up: White supremacy
was and is a global imperial project that divided the world into
civilised, human, citizen-subjects, and non-civilised, sub-human
colonised subjects. The enslavement of Africans and the centrality of
the slave trade for the early development of capitalism and empire for
Atlantic sector European states ensured that anti-blackness would be an
enduring structural feature of white supremacy. But the processes of
racialisation, domination, dispossession and exploitation associated
with white supremacy differed within and across regions. Only by not
homogenising the experiences of the various racially subordinated
populations---including the experiences of people of African
descent---will we be able to analytically forge theories and practices
needed for black liberation. Afropessimism is Anti-Political and Erases
the History and Achievements of Black Liberation Movements. Wilderson
argues that blacks are not of the world, they are also not part of the
"narrative," not part of history. Wilderson states: "As provocative as
it may sound history and redemption (and therefore narrative itself) are
inherently anti-Black."\[11\] For Wilderson, blacks are outside of
history; "space and time" are absent: "just as there is no time for the
Slave, there is also no place for the Slave."\[12\] In asserting that
black people are outside of history, Wilderson is making the claim that
Blackness is irrevocably marked as slaveness---there is no historical
change in the meaning of blackness and position of black people. In
Afropessimism, for example, Wilderson claims that "Afropessimism is
premised on an iconoclastic claim: that Blackness is coterminous with
Slaveness."\[13\] "Blackness," Wilderson emphasises, "cannot exist other
than Slaveness".\[14\] This is not so much an iconoclastic claim as a
false one. It is true, of course, that Black lives after slavery
continued to be marked by domination and violence. The spectre of
extreme violence aimed at individuals and black communities, the
expropriation that marked share cropping in the rural south, the
super-exploitation of black industrial workers, the precarious position
of black women performing paid and unpaid domestic labour, and the
continued vulnerability of black women to all of the above as well as
gender-based domination, all serve to emphasise the continuities of
domination. But while there were important continuities between in the
condition of black people during and after slavery, the rupture caused
by the end of slavery nonetheless represented a massive change in how
black life was organised---a reorganisation that transformed the
articulation between white supremacy and the capitalist social order.
The end of slavery presented new and important opportunities for black
agency even if full "freedom" was not achieved. It was marked by the
formation of black civil society, the emergence of new possibilities as
well as new challenges for black politics. It was during this period
that the institutional backbone of black civil society was
developed---including the black church (which was as much a political
institution as a sacred one); black institutions of higher learning;
cooperative and mutual aid societies; and. a myriad of other
organisational initiatives. All were launched and/or consolidated during
this period. The ability to form families, expand black politics, and
build black civil society represented a type of real if limited
progress. Further, Wilderson's claim that the black condition is defined
by "slaveness," that blacks are not of the world, they are also not part
of the "narrative," not part of history is also profoundly
anti-political. For Wilderson, blacks exist outside of the domain of
politics: "The violence of the slave estate cannot be thought of the way
one thinks of the violence of capitalist oppression. It takes an ocean
of violence to produce a slave, singular or plural, but that violence
never goes into remission. Again, the prehistory of violence that
establishes slavery is also the concurrent history of slavery[. This is
a difficult cognitive map for most activists to adjust to because it
actually takes the problem outside of politics."\[15\] Wrong. What
progress has been made has been the result of fighting through social
movements that, as Malcolm X urged, used any means necessary. **Fighting
oppression is inherently political**. The anti-political nature of
Wilderson's central claim casts aside the momentous struggles of black
people for liberation in the U.S., massive struggles for freedom
throughout **the African Diaspora**, the 20th-century African national
liberation struggles, as well as contemporary African struggles against
neocolonialism, neoliberal regimes, and against the new imperial project
of redividing Africa. Perhaps the most immoral implication of
Wilderson's claim that slaveness defines blackness is that the human is
defined against blackness.]{.underline} If blacks are not human then it
is easier to claim that black people are outside of history, and blacks
are outside the realm of politics. For Wilderson, all human life is
defined in opposition blackness, in opposition to the condition of being
a slave. Wilderson explains, "Human Life is dependent on Black death for
its existence and for its conceptual coherence. There is no world
without Blacks, yet there are no Blacks who are in the World."\[16\]
This claim places Wilderson outside of both the black radical and black
nationalist traditions. Black movements whether black liberal, black
Marxist, or black nationalist fought and died insisting on Africans'
humanity---although some, particularly but not exclusively many black
nationalists, questioned the humanity of those that enslaved others.
Black movements have historically, and correctly, demanded a place in a
world the recognition of one's own humanity regardless of one's status
as enslaved, expropriated, and oppressed. Afropessimism Distorts the
Relationship Between Anti-Blackness, White Supremacy, Patriarchy, and
Capitalism Finally and critically, this version of Afropessimism
severely mischaracterises the relationship between anti-blackness, white
supremacy, and capitalism.\[17\] [Wilderson asserts that political
economy is of little use for analysing the black condition as the
condition of the slave, the condition of blacks, is subject to violence
that cannot be explained by political economy.]{.underline} Further, the
status of the slave is invariant to "historical shifts[." I assert that
only by understanding the interaction between the multiple systems of
domination blacks are subject to---white supremacy (of which
anti-blackness is a central structural feature), patriarchy and
capitalism---will we be able to understand for any given era the status
of blacks; the massive and multiple forms of violence that blacks
experience, and the way forward toward full black
liberation.]{.underline} In Afropessimism, Wilderson only briefly
considers the role of political economy in black subjugation. He argues
that the use/study of political economy cannot explain the violence
committed against blacks. This violence, Wilderson argues, is invariant
across time. Specifically: "Black people exist in the throes of what
historian David Eltis calls 'violence beyond the limit,' by which he
means: (a) in the libidinal economy there are no forms of violence so
excessive that they would be considered too cruel to inflict upon
Blacks; and (b) in political economy there are no rational explanations
for this limitless theatre of cruelty, no explanations that would make
political or economic sense of the violence that positions and punishes
Blackness....the Slave's relationship to violence is
open-ended...unaccountable to historical shifts."\[18\] What Wilderson
misses is that blacks are subject to multiple sources of violence---the
cumulative nature of which is monstrous. [Simultaneously analysing the
articulation of white supremacy, patriarchy, and capitalism leads one to
the realisation that blacks depending on context in various combinations
experience violence as workers, women, and/or as black people. Each
system of domination routinely inflicts violence for those at the bottom
of each hierarchy]{.underline}. I would add that an aspect of white
supremacy and anti-blackness is that for blacks even the forms of
violence that derive from patriarchy and capitalism are intensified due
to white supremacy. This violence is also rational to the degree that
each form of violence is ultimately aimed at reinforcing the rule of
those at the top of each system of domination. In a much earlier essay,
Wilderson more directly addresses the relationship between capitalism
and black subjugation. Wilderson asserts that "...the United States is
constructed at the intersection of both a capitalist and white
supremacist matrix."\[19\] This statement is promising in that it hints
at the simultaneous analysis of the interaction between capitalism and
white supremacy. Yet, he does not sufficiently explore the consequences
of this statement and does not analyse the actual dynamics created by
the articulation of capitalism and white supremacy. For example, in
Afropessimism Wilderson correctly asserts that "....the emergence of the
slave, the subject-effect of an ensemble of direct relations of force
marks the emergence of the capitalism itself."\[20\] The "primitive"
accumulation necessary for the establishment of the capitalist social
order does have at its centre the brutal and hideous social relations of
slavery and the slave trade, but not only slavery.\[21\] But unlike what
Wilderson argues, the historical record shows that under white supremacy
and colonialism blacks are not the only racially subordinate group to be
subject to "direct relations of force." As Ince argues, "direct
relations of force" do not only mark the subject of the slave, but of
the colonised more generally such as the genocide of the indigenous
peoples of particularly the "New" World (itself a precondition of
capitalism).\[22\] Establishing and maintaining capitalism has required
the expropriation of resources and labour---simultaneously wedded to the
violation of black, brown, and yellow bodies throughout the world. In
the end, non-white bodies are disposable in the global North and South;
in the ghettoes, barrios, reservations, prisons, refugee camps and
immigration detention centres that can be grimly found throughout the
world. The particularities are important---and anti-blackness is a key
particularity that shapes capitalism and white supremacy, but as argued
earlier, it still a part a global system of white supremacy marked by
direct relations of force, and which non-whites are racialised
differently by that force. Within the context of the U.S., only a type
of stubborn blindness, a refusal to acknowledge the historical record,
and refusal to see the interrelationship between capitalism and racial
domination can lead those such as Wilderson to argue that "we were never
meant to be workers.....From the very beginning, we were meant to be
accumulated and die."\[23\] This assertion flies against the historical
evidence. No, blacks were meant to work, die, and be accumulated as need
be. White supremacy often demands that blacks die. Capitalism demands
that blacks must also, when necessary work and/or be accumulated. Each,
and patriarchy as well, continually make their bloody demands. Through
politics and other means of struggle blacks continually resist. This
resistance can only be successful by understanding the mutual
articulation between each system of domination. Conclusion: What is at
Stake? What is at stake is far more critical than an abstract academic
debate between theorists. These debates speak directly to how we
understand Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential elections and the
racist, authoritarian and potentially fascist phenomenon of "Trumpism"
and the rise of neo-fascist movements in the global north and south. It
speaks to how we best understand the accelerating rates of inequality in
both the global north and south popularly described by Thomas
Piketty.\[24\] It speaks to how we understand the rising wave of
violence that black folks face here, throughout the Diaspora, and within
Africa itself. Afropessimists have an ahistorical narrative that
distorts the relationship of white supremacy to capitalism---insisting
despite all historical and contemporary empirical evidence to the
contrary that the core logics of slave-based anti-blackness exists
outside of, and ultimately invariant to, the dynamics of the capitalist
political economy. This strand of theorising has taken root in
real-world activism---in this case among young black activists
struggling once again for black liberation. Afropessimism, however,
presents real political dangers for those organising for black
liberation. I will mention three such dangers here. By arguing that
black subjugation lies outside the realm of the political, Afropessimism
serves as a basis for political demobilisation rather than mobilisation.
Indeed, Wilderson is correct when he states, "This is a difficult
cognitive map for most activists to adjust to because it actually takes
the problem outside of politics."\[25\] Second, Afropessimism severely
undermines those attempting to build solidarity with other racially
subordinate groups. Do we still need to be building independent radical
black movements and organisations? Yes. Is building solidarity hard.
Yes. Is one likely to experience anti-black racism from some other
peoples of colour? Yes. Is it still a necessary task if meaningful
political victories are to be achieved? Yes. Third, by ignoring the
class and gender dynamics within black communities, Afropessimism makes
it far more difficult to understand the dynamics of intra-black
politics. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for fighting all forms
of oppression and domination that are experienced within black
communities. Afropessimists are correct to insist that the logics of
racial domination are autonomous and not fully determined by a
capitalist social order. Afropessimists fail to understand, however, the
effects of the interaction of multiple systems of domination have on
black life and politics. It is our task to forge better theoretical
weapons to not only illuminate the nature of oppressive systems of
domination, but also to provide effective tools to combat oppression.

We live in a time grappling with anti-black racism, in which the term
"anti-blackness" has become part of the public lexicon. Descriptively,
anti-blackness seems self-evident; however, the term's [relationship to
race and racism is undertheorized. We argue here that the recent
discourse of anti-blackness needs to be situated not as more than, or
beyond, race but in and as a racial discourse]{.underline}. The
emergence of "anti-blackness" as a concept is recent, dating back a
little more than a quarter of a century. The first substantive use of
the concept appears in Joseph R. Washington's (1984) Anti-Blackness in
English Religion to argue that anti-blackness (a negative attitude
towards all things black, dark, etc.) provided the basis for
anti-Blackness (anti-black racism). His account is largely
impressionistic and it does not systematically explain the
transformation of attitudes into racial/racist theories. Amiri Baraka,
in a 1987 article published in The Black Scholar, used the term to
denounce how White art reproduces racism in the process of incorporating
"Black images." Yet, [the use of "anti-blackness" in Baraka is
understated, and the conceptual apparatus pivots on other analytics such
as racism, imperialism, socialism, and self-determination.]{.underline}
By the 1990s, there emerged a clear conceptual discussion of
anti-blackness in Lewis Gordon's works within an existentialist and
phenomenological framework. For Gordon, the problematic was the
possibility of Black existence in a world predicated on denying the
validity of blackness. Yet, the operative term remains "antiblack
racism," i.e. the set of conditions and practices that seek to create
"an antiblack world." By the 2000s, the use of anti-blackness increases
exponentially with the appearance of self-styled "Afropessimist"
literature in the academy. Here, a discourse of anti-blackness begins to
emerge, with the term anti-blackness operating largely in rhetorical
mode (see for example Frank Wilderson's Bildungsroman narratives about
his emergence as the last political radical in a world of neoliberal
sell-outs). More recently, as Afropessimism has reached a broader
audience via social media and other online channels, anti-blackness has
assumed widespread currency in both the academic and popular presses.
Recent years have witnessed calls in the mainstream media for greater
attention to "anti-blackness" as opposed to "racism." Proponents of
anti-blackness have sought to distinguish the two concepts and have made
claims in the name of anti-racism that nevertheless critique its very
grounds. For example, in a widely circulated New York Times piece,
kihana miraya ross argues that, while "the word 'racism' is everywhere,"
it fails to capture just "what black people in this country are facing."
Rather than "racism," ross argues, "the right term is 'anti-blackness.'"
Anti-blackness, according to ross, describes "the kind of violence that
saturates black life" -- a violence that is "gratuitous and
unrelenting." According to ross, the term "racism" is not only too broad
(a "catch-all," as she calls it), it also fails to capture the
complexity of anti-blackness. Similarly, Ahmed Olayinka Sule's 2019
piece in The Guardian, argued that "it is an appropriate time for
anti-blackness to be classified separately from racism and given its own
prominence." [His argument against a "one-size-fits-all" approach to
anti-racist scholarship and organizing, like ross's piece, validates and
extends a discourse of anti-blackness that purports to be more specific
and more trenchant than other (though unnamed) critical theories of race
and racism. "In setting anti-blackness apart from and against theories
of race and racism, its proponents not only refuse to historicize their
concept, they also refuse to contextualize it in relation to and as a
racial discourse."]{.underline} It would be [wrong to understand
arguments like ross's and Sule's solely, or even primarily, as
clamorings for greater recognition of, and attention to, the
particularity and immediacy of anti-black racism. Rather, the authors
build on a subtle but troubling argument that positions anti-blackness
against racism and which has implications for evaluating each piece
(ross's and Sule's) as an anti-racist work. According to its proponents,
the durability of anti-blackness---its "relentlessness" to use ross's
term---is its defining characteristic and what distinguishes it as more
than another type of racism among racisms. Rather than contingent and
contestable, as critical theories of race and racism have emphasized,
anti-blackness endures. To again quote ross, anti-blackness is a
"structural reality" and is nothing if not deeply embedded.
Anti-blackness, then, significantly shifts the terms of racial
discourse. In contrast to critical theories of race and racism that have
emphasized contingency and historicity, anti-blackness asserts a
permanence that is theoretically explicated in Afropessimist literature.
Afropessimism locates the origins of anti-blackness in slavery and then
asserts its "relentlessness" and durability over time.]{.underline} As
ross's article from above states, Afropessimism "argues that
anti-blackness indexes the structural reality so that in the larger
society, blackness is inextricably tied to 'slaveness.' While the system
of U.S. chattel slavery technically ended 150 years ago, it continues to
mark the ontological position of black people." In Afropessimist
theorizations, slavery serves more as origin story than historical
contextualization. The connections between anti-blackness and slavery
are crystallized in Afropessimist writing and erected as a foundational
truth rather than emerging as an unstable, historical articulation. [The
shift that anti-blackness presents for thinking about race and racism is
made obscure precisely because it is the field of racial discourse that
new theorizations of anti-blackness disavow. Normatively, critical
theories of race and racism involve a certain epistemological and
political reflexivity towards racial discourse. This is because
theorists understand that their statements on race participate in
reproducing and potentially deepening racial conditions. By contrast,
proponents of anti-blackness have abjured this reflexivity. They
paradoxically deny the applicability of anti-blackness to the discursive
field it participates in.]{.underline} As ross writes, anti-blackness is
"more than just 'racism against black people.'" Instead, she asserts
that it is "a theoretical framework," or as Wilderson has claimed of
Afropessimism, it is a "metatheory." [In setting anti-blackness apart
from and against theories of race and racism, its proponents not only
refuse to historicize their concept, they also refuse to contextualize
it in relation to and as a racial discourse.]{.underline} This [double
elision explains why the shift in racial discourse that anti-blackness
presents has yet to register with many theorists of race, even as the
term has proliferated in and outside the academy.]{.underline} It is
important to recognize this shift and to note its implications for
racial theory and the praxis of antiracism. To conclude, [we want to
clarify the implications of the argument at hand and ask what it would
mean to situate anti-blackness not as more than, or beyond, race but in
and as racial discourse. In spite of claims to the contrary, what does a
reading of anti-blackness as racial discourse reveal?]{.underline} As a
racial discourse, anti-blackness becomes clearer when understood in the
postracial moment. [The postracial constitutes raciality anew by
paradoxically denying the salience of race and racism. Anti-blackness,
correspondingly, fixes racial meaning in the very moment it purports to
move beyond race. By refusing discursive and historical analysis in
favor of a theory of permanence or relentlessness, anti-blackness
obscures the instability of racial power and the ways racial meaning is
made and unmade in the postracial moment. What we have outlined here
suggests that the discourse of anti-blackness risks camouflaging
postraciality as anti-racist work.]{.underline} To the extent that
proponents of anti-blackness refuse to theorize the historical
particularity and relationality of race and racism, they reject the very
tools necessary to explain or combat the operation of the racial power
they diagnose.
