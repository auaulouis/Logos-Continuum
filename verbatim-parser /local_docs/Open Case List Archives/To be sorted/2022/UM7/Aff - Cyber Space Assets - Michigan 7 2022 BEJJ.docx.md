#### Ukraine [completely shifted]{.underline} NATO priorities towards Russia\-\--failure to readdress Chinese advancements opens the door for [Chinese adventurism]{.underline} AND [security threats]{.underline}.

[NATO's **vague recognition**]{.underline} in 2021 [that China
constitutes a **challenge**]{.underline} to the transatlantic alliance
[reflects an **institution** that]{.underline} has [failed to take on
the security threats]{.underline} emanating [from Beijing]{.underline}.
Russia's invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline} on February 24, 2022
[highlights the reasons why this]{.underline} omission [is]{.underline}
**[problematic]{.underline}**. The war in [Ukraine has
reignited]{.underline} **[transatlantic unity]{.underline}** of purpose
[in addressing]{.underline} threats from [Moscow]{.underline} toward
European security. [The]{.underline} existential [shock that Europe is
facing]{.underline} now [that a **Russian regime** has shown itself
willing to go to war]{.underline} against European countries
[carries]{.underline} with it [the risk that **China will be
forgotten**]{.underline} when NATO discusses its future priorities.
During the war, China is walking a tightrope between maintaining its
commitment to sovereignty and territorial integrity and keeping up
cooperation with Russia. The future strength of the Chinese-Russian
partnership is likely to be determined by the continued usefulness of
Moscow in China's efforts to carve out more space for a Sinocentric
international order based on authoritarian regimes. Meanwhile, [China
will continue to engender threats to the **US** and
**Europe**]{.underline} in all domains and across geographical regions.

With the summit statement of the North Atlantic Council released June
14, 2021, NATO extended a commitment to "engage China with a view to
defending the security interests of the Alliance," since "China's stated
ambitions and assertive behavior present systemic challenges to the
rules-based international order and to areas relevant to Alliance
security."1 China's coercive policies, nuclear arsenal, military
modernization, military cooperation with Russia, lack of transparency,
and use of disinformation are listed as main areas of concern for the
alliance. NATO takes the China challenge seriously but has yet to devise
a strategy to address it.

Compared to the United States, Europe took a long time to acknowledge
its stake in managing security challenges from China. As Beijing pushed
beyond its traditional zones of interest in East and Southeast Asia
toward the Indian Ocean in the 2000s, US security policies began to
focus more on China as Washington sought a new geopolitical equilibrium
in Asia.2 Since 2014, France and the UK have spearheaded Europe's naval
diplomacy to counter the displays of force and increasing tensions in
maritime Asia to which China contributes. This engagement has focused on
regular exercises with the US and its Asian allies, operations in
support of freedom of navigation, and base-sharing agreements.3 In 2021,
the EU recognized that these geopolitical dynamics directly impact its
security and announced the establishment of supportive mechanisms in its
Indo-Pacific strategy.4 However, [NATO has been]{.underline}
conspicuously [absent in]{.underline} these [**transatlantic endeavors**
designed to counter **challenges** to]{.underline} US and European
**[security]{.underline}**. Reflecting NATO's absence from the main
arena of US-China strategic competition, the alliance is hardly ever
mentioned in off-the-record conversations on Indo-Pacific security
between diplomats and think tank personnel.

NATO's reluctance to take on the China challenge is perhaps not
surprising, given its inherent assumption that the European continent is
the jewel in the crown of the US alliance system, which is thought to
guarantee US assistance in the event of a military threat against
Europe. This assumption was challenged during the Trump administration,
which openly questioned the US commitment to Article Five's collective
defense obligation. The invasion of Ukraine has given NATO a new lease
on life and put it at the frontlines of transatlantic cooperation on
deterring Russia from further military action in future. However,
[NATO's focus on its **eastern frontline** carries the risk that the
alliance turns into a **Russia-focused** European institution and
ignores]{.underline} that [China]{.underline} is a global great power
competitor [which also constitutes a **major challenge**]{.underline} to
the security of all NATO member states.

Washington increasingly looks to the EU rather than NATO for guidance on
Europe's future security policy. One reason is that NATO's toolbox is
lagging in domains such as cyber and outer space, although cyber and
outer space operations are key enablers of actions in all domains
including air, sea, and land. One indication of this is the US-EU
negotiations surrounding a common response to cyber threats which took
place during the first US-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) meeting
in Pittsburgh in September 2021. In addition, during Trump's presidency,
longstanding US dissatisfaction with Europe's modest defense spending
threatened to put NATO on the backburner in transatlantic security
debates.5 Since then, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has elicited a sea
change in German defense policy with the announcement in February 2022
that defense spending will increase to more than 2 percent of its gross
domestic output annually.6 While this may be a convincing signal that
Europe will finally devote the resources required for its own defense
and revive NATO's central role in transatlantic security, there is also
a risk that China will be moved to the periphery of the alliance's
agenda.

On February 11, 2022, during the runup to the Russian-Ukrainian war, the
Biden administration published its Indo-Pacific strategy as US Secretary
of State Anthony Blinken was in the midst of a Pacific trip to
Australia, Fiji, and Hawaii.7 This US prioritization signaled that
despite Moscow's war in Europe, Washington remains committed to
strengthening its presence in the Indo-Pacific and competing with China.
If the US drops the ball on the Indo-Pacific, Washington is concerned
that China might use force against Taiwan.8 Consequently, the key
question for the US is how many resources can be tied up in Europe
without losing sight of the long-term goal: deterrence of China. [As
US]{.underline} strategic [competition with China increases while NATO
is sitting on the fence, failure to develop a]{.underline} transatlantic
[defense policy that addresses China will leave Europe
**vulnerable**]{.underline} to China's ability to exploit the weak links
in European defense arrangements, [which are **newly fragmented**
by]{.underline} the Russian invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline}.9

EU efforts to build an independent regional defense profile and nurture
cooperation between Europe's defense industry and national defense
communities reflect a growing recognition that the region needs to
become a self-reliant defense actor. However, Europe still needs to
demonstrate that self-reliance does not imply merely focusing on
Europe's periphery. Otherwise, the industrial challenges from China may
outcompete Europe's defense industry. Shipbuilding is a case in point.
By 2021, China built 50 percent of all existing ships in the world.
[Through]{.underline} design **[collaboration agreements]{.underline}**,
[**cyber espionage**, and **acquisitions**, China has
copied]{.underline} advanced [innovative]{.underline} ship
[designs]{.underline}. Enormous **[financial resources]{.underline}**
from the state [allow **Chinese companies** to]{.underline} enjoy
economies of scale by building dual-use factories which not only
[outcompete **Western companies**]{.underline} in the commercial
shipbuilding industry, but also threaten the production of navy vessels.
If not taken seriously, Europe and the US may soon have no choice but to
buy frigates from China.10 This example demonstrates the centrality of
China for global economic and security developments and should encourage
Europe to manifest a position of unified strength in defending NATO
member states against Chinese security challenges. This realization will
help convince the US and its adversaries that Europe continues to be a
credible partner in countering common threats against transatlantic
security, whether they appear in or beyond the European region.

[China's challenges to]{.underline} US and European [security constitute
such common threats]{.underline} across a broad range of sectors. [These
include **gradual reinterpretations** of]{.underline} principles of
**[international law]{.underline}**, the [subversion of]{.underline}
universal liberal market **[economic practices]{.underline}**, and cyber
insurgencies targeting a wide range of civilian and military entities.
These Chinese [policies]{.underline} all [have]{.underline} major
[**military implications**]{.underline} because they are related to
developments in the operating principles, capabilities, and priorities
of China's armed forces. [Only NATO can offer an integrated]{.underline}
transatlantic [response to the **military aspects**]{.underline} [of
Chinese policies that threaten those sectors across the globe, including
European actors.]{.underline} [NATO's involvement is **essential** if
the credibility of the alliance's security guarantees is to be
preserved]{.underline} and an effective response to China's
encroachments on a liberal rules-based order is to be established.

NATO's involvement is essential to establish an effective response to
China

The [**omnipresent character** of the China threat
demonstrates]{.underline} that i[t is **long overdue** for NATO to
position itself as a **significant player** in addressing
Beijing]{.underline}'s [challenges to transatlantic
security]{.underline}. NATO is key to keeping US and European security
policies coordinated when applying mechanisms of deterrence and defense
against Chinese challenges. If transatlantic unity of purpose is lost,
both the US and Europe are far less likely to succeed in addressing
China sufficiently.

#### Non-kinetic attacks on space based assets are the most likely -- NATO collective defense is key to deterrence

Parliamentary Assembly, Vice-Chairperson of the Sub-Committee on
Transatlantic Defence and Security Cooperation from 2012 to 2015,

42\. [Non-kinetic means, for example, cyber hacking, laser dazzling, or
the emission of electromagnetic pulses, can also be used to interrupt or
disable rather than destroy satellites. While considered less damaging
to the space environment and potentially less traceable, many forms of
non-kinetic attacks are very difficult to attribute, stirring fears of
quick **escalation** and questions of proportionality of response in a
near future conflict where space-assets would likely be involved.
**Russia and China are already heavily invested** in this domain,
ultimately seeking the means to **disrupt US hegemony in space**
(Pellegrino, Stang, 2016).]{.underline}

Non-kinetic means: cyber-attacks, jamming, spoofing, and dazzling

43\. [Because of the resulting debris, which can have a **mutually
destabilising** impact, destroying satellites with kinetic force is not
an ideal method for damaging satellite capability. Non-destructive and
covert methods, such as cyber-attacks]{.underline}, jamming, spoofing,
or dazzling [are alternative means to disrupt and deny access to
satellite capabilities. In fact, space warfare is more likely to involve
the denial of vital information flows supporting command and control of
an enemy's forces, rather than the exoatmospheric destruction of its
space-based assets.]{.underline}

44\. By attacking a satellite's control system, or mission package, [an
actor could take over control of the satellite, shut it down, change its
orbit, put it on collision course with other space objects, or destroy
its solar panels]{.underline} by exposing it to damaging levels of
radiation. In addition, a satellite's global network of ground stations
might be subject to attack with potential serious consequences. 45.
Rather than ASAT weaponry, [cyber-attacks can instead be used to take
control of a satellite or **the whole communication network**, including
the ground stations]{.underline} (Suzuki, 2016). [As implied above,
cybersecurity and space security are **inherently linked**.]{.underline}
As satellite technologies and space assets are sourced from a broad
international supply base they require regular security upgrades to
their software systems via remote, distributed connections, which make
them vulnerable to cyber-attacks (Livingstone and Lewis, 2016).

46\. Due to the nature of their missions, the military pays more
attention than commercial operators to the defence of their space
systems. As a result, commercial satellite telecommunications are more
often than not less resilient than military ones. Still, as [commercial
satellites are increasingly co-opted or leased for military
communications or other civilian mission-critical functions such as air
traffic control, train rail traffic, electrical **grid
management**]{.underline}, and other critical civilian infrastructure,
[commercial satellites can be considered high-value soft targets for
adversaries]{.underline} (Suzuki, 2016). In addition, radio frequencies
for satellite communications are limited and the increase in the number
of commercial and private satellites puts pressure on scarce resources.
Some operators are therefore using less secure frequencies, which are
easier to hack (Suzuki, 2016).

47\. As such, it is clear a range of cyber threats exists against
space-based systems. The [large amount of data transmitted through
satellites presents an opportunity for adversaries to corrupt accuracy
and reliability with a relatively low probability of discovery. Examples
could be: States seeking a military advantage via the theft of
intellectual property; organised criminal elements with sufficient
resources seeking financial gain; amateur or professional hackers
showing off their skills; or even capable terrorist groups wishing to
disrupt services provided by space-based assets or inflict damage on the
space environment. Of course, **any combination of these threats is also
imaginable** depending on the adversaries's assets and
capabilities]{.underline} (Livingstone and Lewis, 2016).

48\. Satellite feeds can also be jammed via the intentional interference
in signal transmission and reception through the deliberate use of radio
noise and electromagnetic signals. In particular, global navigation
satellite system (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming attacks
because civil applications have not always been designed with security
in mind. Often, jamming of GPS signals or other radio telecommunications
can even be carried out using simple, commercially-available tools
(Suzuki, 2016). By way of example, North Korea has carried out a series
of coordinated jamming attacks against the Republic of Korea, which
affected GNSS signals in the Seoul area and led to the degradation of
infrastructure such as mobile phone networks (Livingstone and Lewis,
2016).

49\. [Spoofing allows an adversary to manipulate]{.underline} the
information about [the location, position and condition of a satellite.
Spoofed data is relatively hard to detect.]{.underline} If successful,
[the spoofing attack could damage critical infrastructure, such as the
national power grid]{.underline}, by introducing false timing signals,
[or cause economic damage by targeting]{.underline} trading systems in
[the financial services sector]{.underline} (Livingstone and Lewis,
2016). [Spoofing could also confuse the coordination of command and
control of a nation's armed forces in a time of crisis.]{.underline}

50\. [Dazzling is a way of blinding a satellite with a laser. If the
laser is powerful enough, it can even burn satellite sensors and disable
them]{.underline} (Airbus Space briefing). Docking and rendez-vous
methods are alternative ways of damaging a satellite by using electronic
or kinetic force. While docking would have the benefit of not producing
space debris, it would expose the attacker to detection. To mitigate the
potential consequences of a docking attack, the United States and its
allies are developing a programme of Space Situational Awareness, which
monitors any objects approaching existing space assets (Suzuki, 2016).

51\. The trend toward the [development of increasingly disruptive and
non-attributable non-kinetic means puts the long-term stability of the
space environment at risk. Increasing dependence on space-based
architecture coupled with hybrid and asymmetrical disruption tactics
will create a space environment ripe for **rapid escalation and
instability.**]{.underline}

V. NATO AND THE SPACE DOMAIN

A. WHY SPACE MATTERS FOR NATO

52\. As is clear from above, [improvements in space technology drive the
development of advanced military systems; they are important force
multipliers when integrated into joint operations.]{.underline}
Therefore, a clear and mutual understanding of how military, civil,
commercial, national and multinational space capabilities contribute to
military operations in order to achieve Alliance security objectives is
essential. Increased awareness about the potential for adversaries
seeking to exploit their own access to space for military purposes to
the detriment of Allied assets and capabilities is vitally important
(NATO Allied Joint Doctrine for Air and Space Operations, 2016).

53\. [At the strategic level, NATO is well positioned to strengthen
deterrence in space. NATO's collective defence and economic prosperity
rely on space-based infrastructure, and an attack on the space assets of
one Ally would impact the security of all. As such, **NATO needs a
whole-of-alliance approach** to protect its interests in space to
**enhance resilience and deter any threat** to its space-based
capabilities.]{.underline} At the operational level, space needs to be
incorporated in NATO planning and command structures. At the tactical
level, relevant training should be provided to personnel and NATO
exercises should reflect space warfare scenarios wherein Allied
space-assets are denied or temporarily disabled (Schulte, 2012).

54\. Today's modern operational environment relies heavily on guaranteed
access to space-based architecture -- Allied forces\' daily training,
and maintenance and execution of ongoing operations are all made capable
by a vast network of shared space assets. [Allied space capabilities
provide]{.underline} a number of products and services, including:
[global, strategic and intra-theatre satellite communications;
positioning, navigation and timing services; terrestrial and space
environmental monitoring; real-time space, geological, meteorological
and oceanographic situational awareness; advanced intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities]{.underline}; as well as
NATO Shared Early Warning and transponder tracking such as Friendly
Force tracking and maritime tracking (NATO Allied Joint Doctrine for Air
and Space Operations, 2016).

55\. [NATO's most advanced military systems are dependent upon
space-based assets in order to execute missions successfully,
particularly Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACs), the
Alliance's Ballistic Missile Defence programme, and the Alliance Ground
Surveillance System (AGS),]{.underline} set to become operational in
2017. The AGS system consists of air, ground and support segments and
will perform all-weather and persistent terrestrial and maritime
surveillance in near real-time, contributing to a range of missions1 ,
providing military commanders with a comprehensive picture of the
situation on the ground (GovSat, 2016).

56\. Space capabilities contributing to the Alliance's mission planning
and execution at all levels of warfare come from government, military,
civilian and commercial providers. NATO does not currently own any orbit
spacecraft. It does, however, own and operate several terrestrial
elements (e.g. SATCOM anchor stations and terminals). [The United States
provides the majority of space support NATO currently uses.]{.underline}
However, in 2013, there were approximately 39 'military or government'
satellites owned by NATO Member States other than the US providing
communication, imagery and automatic identification system detection.

57\. The primary European NATO Member States who have space capabilities
are France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy: The availability of
a space capability in support of NATO operations, however, is determined
exclusively by the nation or company that owns the satellite. It should
be noted that France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom have
advanced and capable observation systems supporting their conventional
forces today: they are the Pléiades; SAR-Lupe (radar) and Helios 2
(optical, infrared); COSMO-SkyMed; and Skynet 5 respectively.

58\. Currently the SATCOM Post-2000 programme provides the Alliance with
satellite communications capabilities. The British, French, and Italian
governments work in concert to provide the Alliance with advanced SATCOM
capabilities. Under the signed Memorandum of Understanding between the
three governments, the Alliance is allowed access to the French SYRACUSE
3, the Italian SICRAL 1 and 1Bis, and the British Skynet 4 and 5
military networks (Briefings NATO officials).

59\. The current contract negotiated by the consortium is for a 15-year
period, scheduled to end in 2019. The NATO Communications and
Information Systems Services Agency (NCSA) needs a contract upgrade,
however, as the Alliance's current satellite bandwidth requirements have
outpaced what is available under the current contract. Among other
deficiencies, the current arrangement does not include EHF-/Ka-band
capabilities, which will be critical to future Alliance SATCOM needs (De
Selding, 2016).

60\. To contract the necessary upgrade of its SATCOM capacity, NATO can
look to eight Allies currently developing or in possession of the
satellite capacity necessary for military communications; France,
Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the
United States (De Selding, 2016). In November 2016, NATO awarded a
contract to support the operational phase of the above mentioned AGS
system to Luxembourg's GovSat, an affiliate of satellite operator SES.
Launching in 2017, the GovSat-1 satellite will provide an end-to-end
service including the delivery of satellite capacity in commercial
Ku-band and sensor data communications between the NATO Global Hawk UAVs
and ground segment over the AGS operational area. With this contract,
Luxembourg Authorities and the NCI Agency as procurement executive agent
acquire and manage these services.

61\. While the centrality of space is also recognised in NATO's
Strategic Concept, which mentions technological trends that could
potentially impede access to space (NATO, 2010), NATO has not issued any
policy or military strategy for space operations. So far, only the
Allied Joint Doctrine for Air and Space Operations provides some
guidelines on the role of space support in operational planning. In
2013, NATO also released the NATO Space Handbook, which explains space
fundamentals for commanders and their staff.

B. NATO AND THE SPACE DOMAIN: A WAY FORWARD

62\. [NATO should renew its focus on space cooperation. Every NATO
country relies on safe and reliable access to space assets for both
commerce and military operations.]{.underline} However, [NATO doctrine
and planning have lagged and the Alliance has not issued any military
strategy or policy for space operations.]{.underline} For example, the
Joint Airpower Competence Centre (JAPCC) has proposed a narrow framework
for a NATO Space Policy concentrating on the employment, coordination,
and defence of space capabilities used to support NATO operations and
core business (JAPCC, 2012). Any NATO policy should furthermore be
coherent with existing policies, such as those of the EU and the US. The
JAPCC proposes five guiding principles:

#### China is increasing their technological advancements in space -- an attack on NATO's system would rapidly degrade alliance military capabilities and lead to miscalculation

Madeline **Moon 20**, a member of the UK Delegation to the NATO
Parliamentary Assembly, Vice-Chairperson of the Sub-Committee on
Transatlantic Defence and Security Cooperation from 2012 to 2015,

Capabilities "THE SPACE DOMAIN AND ALLIED DEFENCE," NATO Parliamentary
Assembly,

p. 1-10 /BL

2\. [NATO forces depend greatly on the use of space-based systems for
essential communications, navigation, tracking, and targeting
capabilities, as well as weather forecasting. Space-based system
coordination plays a vital role in all current NATO key pillars of
defence; allowing for the effective management of conventional forces at
home and abroad, nuclear deterrent systems, and the evolving ballistic
missile defence system. Rapid development, use, and dependency on space,
however, imply **growing risks**.]{.underline}

3\. Renewed attention to kinetic anti-satellite (ASAT) capabilities as
well as other forms of non-kinetic space denial capabilities such as
jammers and lasers is increasingly bringing space to the forefront of
security policy planning and debate. [As great power strategic
competition rises again in Europe and Asia-Pacific, the ability to deter
and defend space assets is more important than ever due to the rising
costs associated with a space denial campaign.]{.underline}

4\. While the costs of disruption to space-based architecture are high,
the arena inherently lends itself to collaboration rather than
confrontation, largely due to the difficulty of verification mechanisms
for space-related activities. As a result, many governments continue to
push for a space code of conduct to enhance the prospects for peaceful
space cooperation by reducing the opportunities for miscommunication,
misperception, and misuse of the domain. To date, the Alliance has no
official space policy, though it does have the recently published Allied
Joint Doctrine for Air and Space Operations. [Given its **critical
dependence** on space, NATO Allies must look for a way to consolidate
their approach to and understanding of defence and deterrence in
space.]{.underline}

5\. This report will examine the rapid evolution and increasing
necessity of space-based systems security. It will seek to demonstrate
the role space-based systems play at all levels in Alliance security. It
will then highlight steps parliamentarians can take to push for an
effective NATO space policy.

II\. WHY A DEFENCE COMMITTEE REPORT ON SPACE?

6\. The 21st century will prove to be the race for space. Space-based
systems are the key enablers of national and international
infrastructures of today and tomorrow. [The current speed of
technological developments indicates the pace of diffusion of technology
with some form of dependence on space-related hardware will only
accelerate. Accordingly, outer space is becoming increasingly congested,
contested, and competitive.]{.underline}

7\. [The benefits to investing in space-based assets are clear:
Space-based infrastructure provides data for global positioning,
navigation and timing; enables communication systems via large-scale
data relay; guarantees the accuracy and efficacy of global financial
transactions and trade; supports a wide range of private and public
scientific research; as well as oversees environmental monitoring and
forecasting. As such, satellite constellations are vital for the
efficient functioning of modern aviation, maritime navigation, and
ground transportation (both civil and military).]{.underline}

8\. [As dependence on space-based infrastructures grows, the costs
associated with the disruption, denial, or even destruction of such
assets will have increasingly distributed and devastating effects. In
military operational terms, space-based assets allow for critical
manoeuvre of forces, strategic and situational awareness, and
precision-strike capabilities. The loss of space assets would
significantly hamper any modern military's ability to respond to not
only defend vital assets and populations, but also to respond quickly
and efficiently in a crisis.]{.underline}

9\. As a result, understanding the evolution of the space security
environment is critical for the NATO PA Defence and Security Committee
(DSC). [As the scale of impact of space denial scenarios grows, it is
clear the disruption, denial, or destruction of any Ally's **space
assets** will have an **Alliance-wide resonant effect**. Just as NATO
forces require freedom of action in the land, air, and sea of their
territories, so do they require the freedom from interference with their
space-based assets.]{.underline}

A. MILITARY USES OF SPACE

10\. Throughout the Cold War the United States and the Soviet Union
utilised a range of satellites in conjunction with their strategic
nuclear forces: to both link together their respective command and
control systems and to monitor and track the other side's movements.
[The first Gulf War in 1991 put the benefits of space-enabled systems on
dramatic display; even television audiences could witness the tracking
and elimination of Iraqi military assets by US precision-guided
weaponry. In the ensuing quarter of a century, the centrality of
space-based assets to modern militaries is undeniable.]{.underline}

11\. [Today, space-based assets are essential strategic enablers of
modern forces. Since the advent of net-centric warfare during the US
invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, NATO military forces depend on
satellite services to link and integrate information into land, air, and
sea platforms. Effective and real-time inter-services integration
enhances decision-making and facilitates navigation. As a result,
**space-based assets are serious force multipliers** for today's
militaries.]{.underline}

B. SPACE PROLIFERATION: MANY NEW ACTORS

12\. Technological advances over the last two decades have greatly
expanded the breadth and depth of possibilities for space access. As a
result, a proliferation of actors hoping to have a stake in space is
changing the nature of the three principal geocentric orbits. The flood
of new actors is making these orbits increasingly congested and dirty.

13\. Currently almost every country either owns a satellite or has a
stake in space. There are approximately 1,100 operational satellites in
orbit around the Earth, causing some orbital planes to be severely
overcrowded. The recent advent of new, dynamic commercial actors has
renewed public interest and ignited a second space race (UK Parliament
Briefings). Companies such as SpaceX and Virgin Galactic are providing
competition between service providers to build, launch, and operate new
space systems: the outcome being a steady decline in the cost barrier to
space entry and the proliferation of new systems operators (Insinna,
2016).

14\. As entry costs continue to fall, the space domain is becoming more
easily and more widely accessible, not only to the military and the
commercial sector, but also to ordinary citizens due to the development
of a range of new, increasingly smaller satellites from mini to micro,
and even nano, pico, and femto-satellites -- which range from over 500kg
to less than 100g. While providing many of the capabilities of current
satellites, they will be cheaper to produce and easier to launch, but
harder to track and regulate (Lewis and Livingstone, 2016).

15\. The scope of the challenge of the growth of satellites in space
will only continue to grow because of this relative democratisation of
space entry and use. In 2016, the Federal Communications Commission of
the United States alone, for example, had received over 8,700 filings
for launches of Non-Geosynchronous Orbit (NGSO) communications
satellites (Messier, 2016). If these projects are completed, along with
the thousands of other projects planned by nations around the globe, Low
Earth Orbit congestion will pose a significant regulation challenge.

III\. GREAT AND RISING POWERS IN SPACE

16\. [New actors are changing the geostrategic space environment and
will shape space policies in the 21st century. The United States and
Russia are still the world's leading space powers; other countries,
however, are steadily advancing their space capabilities, **particularly
China**, which has developed successful launch capabilities and a
multifaceted space programme over the last decade]{.underline} (Robinson
and Romancov, 2014).

17\. The United States is still widely considered the world leader in
space. It has the largest space budget, a vast network of military and
commercial satellites, and a burgeoning commercial space sector. The
rise of the commercial sector's involvement in space has spurred on a
second space race, with companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin racing
to see who can get to Mars first (Briefings UK Parliament). European
space and defence sector giant Airbus Defence and Space is working on
the ExoMars rover to explore the surface of that planet (Briefings
Airbus Defence and Space).

18\. As noted above, the rapid pace of commercial development of space
launch, control, and satellite assets is changing the nature of space
access and exploration. A clear benefit to the United States's growing
commercial space sector is the competition's cost reduction effect and
the added resiliency to the US military's vital assets in space. The US
military has used Boeing-Lockheed Martin's United Launch Alliance to
launch its payloads, but the recent certification of SpaceX's Falcon 9
rocket to launch US national security payloads is adding price-lowering
competition to the market. In addition, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic
are competing to supply the US Space Agency with a reusable spaceplane
for its Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) (Insinna,
2016). The continued growth of US involvement in space at both the
governmental and private sector levels has allowed it to remain the
clear leader in space.

19\. [Second to the US presence in space is Russia. Moscow owns a
massive constellation of military satellites. Most provide the Russian
military with globe-spanning communications capabilities (Luzin, 2016).
In 2014, the Russian government announced it would increase funding for
the Russian Federal Space Agency to modernise and expand infrastructure
and capabilities by 2020 (World Economic Forum, 2016).]{.underline}
However, international sanctions following Russia's annexation of Crimea
have crippled the Russian space industry by depriving it of the advanced
components needed to build many new communications and navigation
satellites (Luzin, 2016).

20\. Despite recent tensions and growing strategic competition in Europe
and the Middle East, Russia and the United States maintain relatively
strong levels of space cooperation. The long tradition of US-Russia
space cooperation, dating back to the earliest era in space exploration
in the 1950s and 60s, continues today with the countries' use of the
International Space Station (ISS). The ISS is the cooperative project
supported by the United States, Canada, Europe, and Russia; the ebb and
flows of the US Space Agency has made the US dependent at times on
Russia's shuttle capacity, and the United States currently depends on
the Russian-made RD-180 engines for its Atlas rockets, which launch US
payloads into space.

21\. After years of investment and strategy, [China is on its way to
becoming a space superpower]{.underline}. While China's estimated space
budget is still dwarfed by the US, [in 2016 it had 19 successful space
launches]{.underline} --- the second-highest number for the year behind
Russia's 26, and [ahead of America's 18]{.underline}. [China has put up
sophisticated communications and intelligence satellites, offered cheap
launch services to other nations, and launched manned mission
initiative]{.underline}s. In addition, [China developed **a "quantum
satellite**" designed to transmit quantum-**encrypted information** from
space, which is **theoretically hack-proof** and ensures any attempt to
intercept or tamper with the transmission would alert both sender and
receiver]{.underline} (Dillow et al., 2016).

#### Lack of dialogue to clarify intentions in emerging conflict spheres like the outer space-cyberspace intersection [escalates]{.underline} crises [on earth]{.underline} by creating use-or-lose pressures for all space-enabled military assets 

Laura **Grego 20**, senior scientist in the Global Security Program at
the Union of Concerned Scientists, 1/8/20, "The New U.S. Space Force
Will Make Space More Dangerous, Not Less,"
https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/28452/why-the-trump-space-force-will-make-space-more-dangerous

But [keeping space secure]{.underline} also [**requires** reducing the
threats to satellites]{.underline}. On this score, the Space Force is
likely to make space a more contentious and dangerous environment, not
less. It's not just Trump's rhetoric about dominance in space that is
harmful; resources for the new military service will be provided to
"deter aggression in, from, and to space." This will create incentives
within the national security bureaucracy to hype the threat of space
weapons, and to then build new weapons to counter them.

In a speech last spring outlining his priorities for space, Gen. David
L. Goldfein, the chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force, stated that,
"It's not enough to step into the ring and just bob and weave... At some
point, we've got to hit back." What Goldfein failed to mention is that
the U.S. already has more sophisticated anti-satellite technology than
potential adversaries like Russia and China. In fact, having
anti-satellite weapons actually does very little to keep one's own
satellites safe from attack. Yet military leaders appear to believe that
reserving the option to deny the use of space to potential adversaries
is more important than the benefits that come with a less weaponized
space.

What's more, [unconstrained development of space weapons will make space
more dangerous, costly and unpredictable]{.underline} to use. [It will
make **conflict on Earth riskier**]{.underline}, too. [A space
environment]{.underline} that is [perceived as threatening may create an
incentive to "use or lose" **sat**ellite-enabled military capabilities
as a crisis approaches]{.underline}, potentially **[speeding up
conflict]{.underline}**. Goldfein underscored this point in remarks
following a series of space conflict simulations conducted by the Air
Force last month. "[In every war game]{.underline}," he said, "[we
determined]{.underline} that [if you move first in space, you're not
guaranteed to win. But **if you move second, you're likely to
lose**]{.underline}."

[In the absence of **robust international agreements** to protect
satellites and the outer space environment]{.underline}---the 1967 Outer
Space Treaty does not specifically ban non-nuclear weapons from being
tested in space or put into orbit---[more countries are developing
weapons that can destroy satellites in orbit]{.underline}, leaving
fast-moving bits of debris that can stay in space for decades and later
damage other satellites. When India obliterated its own satellite with
an anti-satellite weapon last March, Prime Minister Narendra Modi
expressed pride afterward that it had joined an "elite club of space
powers." Testing anti-satellite weapons, much less engaging in an actual
conflict in space, can have profound and lasting effects on space. For
example, the destruction of a single large satellite in low-Earth orbit
would more than double the amount of dangerous debris in these important
orbits.

[Sensible constraints on this kind of behavior]{.underline}, and limits
on dangerous space weapons technologies, [would go a long way to
**augmenting stability**]{.underline}, preserving the space environment
and avoiding an arms race. But attempts to hammer out such constraints
have seen little success. The United Nations Conference on Disarmament
has been deadlocked for decades. Negotiations over the European Union's
proposed International Code of Conduct for Outer Space
Activities---which would require signatories to resolve not to damage or
destroy any satellite except for reasons of safety, self-defense or to
avoid debris production---foundered in 2015. Last year, a group of
U.N.-convened governmental experts looking at space arms control
concluded their deliberations without coming to consensus
recommendations.

Still, [the outlook is not all bleak. Even without binding legal
instruments, no state has ever intentionally destroyed another's
satellite]{.underline}. And in 2018, 87 U.N. member states agreed to
voluntary guidelines to protect the long-term sustainability of the
space environment.

However, [despite the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[having the most investment in space]{.underline}---nearly half of
operational satellites are American---[it has put very little effort
into space-related diplomacy]{.underline}. While the Space Force is big
news for the Pentagon, the State Department is nowhere to be seen.
Russia and China have repeatedly submitted drafts of their preferred
arms control arrangement to the U.N. Conference on Disarmament, most
recently in 2014. Their proposed treaty would include binding
prohibitions on placing weapons in space and using force or threatening
the use of force against satellites. The United States repeatedly
rejects these proposals as flawed but declines to provide its own
alternative vision.

Despite, or perhaps [because of, the deep ideological divides between
the world's great powers, it is **critically important**]{.underline}
that [they keep engaging with each other, if only to **avoid
miscalculation**. Information about]{.underline} potential [adversaries'
technical capabilities is plentiful]{.underline}, especially in a highly
visible domain like space. [But **assessing their intentions** is
notoriously difficult]{.underline}. The U.S. and Russia have built some
shared understandings over the course of decades of diplomatic
engagement, but Washington has little such common ground with China. As
a result, [the world's two largest economies risk **misinterpreting each
other in**]{.underline} potentially **[very serious ways]{.underline}**.

[Understanding an adversary's intentions brings]{.underline} more
[clarity to decision-making]{.underline} in a complex operating
environment [and may help manage or resolve a conflict more
successfully]{.underline}. In 2010, Lincoln P. Bloomfield Jr., a veteran
U.S. national security official, warned that [without a history of
bilateral understandings or crisis management in conflicts involving
**emerging domains like outer space and cyberspace**, there would be "no
credible basis for anyone]{.underline} around the president [to
attribute restraint to the adversary]{.underline}, no track record from
which to interpret the actions by the adversary."

[Those risks have not faded]{.underline} in the ensuing decade. If
anything, [**they have multiplied**. Doubling down on new space
weapons]{.underline} and creating a dedicated Space Force [while
neglecting to vigorously pursue sensible negotiated constraints seems a
**sure path to a dangerous future**]{.underline}, after having wasted
billions of dollars.

[**Info**rmation is the lifeblood of US **military strength,** making
the space assets that create and/or transmit this information to distant
forces extraordinarily appealing targets]{.underline}. [**The US
econ**omy]{.underline} increasingly [**depends on** space-enabled
information services]{.underline} (SEIS) as well. [China is also
becoming more space dependent, but]{.underline} most scenarios for
possible military space operations would occur much closer to China
(e.g., Taiwan, East/South China Sea) than to the US mainland, allowing
[China to be less space-asset dependent than the US.]{.underline} [The
space and cyber domains are closely intertwined]{.underline}, and in
their essence deal with information and share a number of similarities.
[The importance of both the space and cyber domains to strategic
planning and crisis management is matched by the lack of much real-world
crisis management experience in these domains]{.underline}. These
incentives exist for Russia as well. [In a crisis, both China and the US
would likely face an unstable, high-stakes environment that is neither
familiar nor well understood]{.underline}. In this environment,
[**China** in particular would]{.underline} likely be tempted to
[**escalate quickly** in both space and cyber domains to disrupt US
military forces and operations if it could, ideally before they could
even arrive]{.underline} (Miller & Fontaine, 2017). Being somewhat less
space dependent[, China would be less vulnerable to US space offense and
might be more emboldened to escalate in space than the US]{.underline}.
[Both countries seem likely to conduct offensive operations in
cyberspace during the early stages of a crisis]{.underline}, though they
would want to exercise some caution in the extensiveness of their
operations because of escalatory risks. [Understanding space escalation
dynamics in the context of crisis stability]{.underline} requires
grasping its strategic landscape, including how deterrence functions or
fails in a crisis and what factors strengthen or weaken that deterrence.
Interdependencies between and among space and other domains are
enormously complicated, and their exploration is essential to
understanding twentyfirst century strategic crisis dynamics[. In the
late stages of a crisis that threatens to transition into conflict,
adversaries would be likely to engage in]{.underline} limited [space and
cyber actions designed both to send a signal of intention to escalate if
conditions are not met]{.underline} (could be either a real threat or a
bluff) and to [put themselves in a more advantageous position should
major conflict break out.]{.underline} [Space asset vulnerabilities
provide an adversary with dangerously attractive incentives to escalate
and preemptively attack in a crisis]{.underline} (MacDonald, Blair,
Cheng, Mueller, & Samson, 2016). In such a scenario, each side would
confront the choice of striking first with all its assets in place,
knowing that a conflict is beginning; or ceding the initiative,
absorbing a first strike, and making a ragged retaliation against an
opponent fully expecting such a response[. As a crisis progresses and
becomes more intense, each side must wrestle with the prospect that the
chances for **full-scale conflict** are increasing]{.underline}. While
neither side may wish for a full-scale war, neither side wishes to
receive a major first strike. instability, where pre-emption pays far
greater benefits than retaliation (Colby & Gerson, 2013). The weaker or
more disadvantaged country in a crisis may find this line of thinking
irresistible, or at least preferable to the alternatives. Countries
sometimes go to war not because they want to, but because doing so
appears less risky than not doing so. Any space power would want to
avoid being in an unstable use-or-lose situation. In addition[, a major
feature of the space and particularly cyber domains is that major
attacks can be initiated with little advance warning---and in the case
of cyber--- with]{.underline} almost [no warning.]{.underline} In the
space and cyber domains[, there is nothing comparable to the stabilizing
threat of an assured second-strike capability like that represented in
the nuclear domain by sea-based ballistic missiles.]{.underline} [For
the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}, [there are greater risks if
conflict escalates into space]{.underline}. Given our greater dependence
on space both militarily and economically[, the US will want to
emphasize deterrence of conflict in space]{.underline}. T[his can be
achieved not just by having space offense, though this would be a
necessary component, but also through cross-domain pre-eminence.
**Conflict is unlikely** to be **confined to** **space**; cyber and
conventional domains will also be involved.]{.underline} Even if the US
prevailed in a space-only conflict, the victory would likely be Pyrrhic
unless it was overwhelming---China and Russia are unlikely to engage
their forces far away from their shores, unlike the US. Thus [losing our
space capabilities would be more damaging to us than it would be to
Russia or China]{.underline} (Morgan, 2010). Until we have a much more
survivable and resilient space architecture, we should not want to put
our space assets at risk unless absolutely necessary. This
\'vulnerability/dependence gap\' can be addressed through cross-domain
advantages that the US has, particularly in the cyber domain

[Nuclear warfare could have **devastating impacts on millions of
people**,]{.underline} yet it has been suggested that [regional or
**global nuclear conflict**]{.underline} [may be possible in the
**future**]{.underline} (Toon et al., 2019). In addition to the
calamitous impacts of nuclear conflict on a local level, [research
conducted with a **range of climate models**]{.underline} [finds
a]{.underline} [**global cooling** in **response** to **various conflict
scenarios**]{.underline} (Coupe et al., 2019; Malone et al., 1985; Mills
et al., 2014; Pausata et al., 2016; Robock et al., 2007; Turco et al.,
1983). [This global cooling is driven by fires **started** by the
**nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. [These fires inject smoke into the
**upper troposphere**]{.underline}, [where rapid lofting
can]{.underline} [spread the sunlight-absorbing soot **particles into
the stratosphere**]{.underline} (Turco et al., 1983). [Recent research
implies that even a **small nuclear conflict** may have **impacts on the
global climate system**]{.underline}, [affecting]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} state and [circulation of the atmosphere]{.underline}
(Robock et al., 2007), [increasing the sea ice extent in both
hemispheres]{.underline} (Mills et al., 2014), [and **reducing plant
productivity** and **crop yields** in **regions far from the conflict
location**]{.underline} (Özdogan et al., ˘ 2013; Toon et al., 2019; Xia
& Robock, 2013). While [less studied]{.underline}, [the]{.underline}
potential [impacts of **nuclear conflict** on the **ocean**]{.underline}
are many. Numerous [physical]{.underline}, [chemical]{.underline}, [and
biological processes]{.underline} [in the ocean are **temperature
dependent**]{.underline}, [and sunlight is a critical ingredient
for]{.underline} photosynthesizing phyto[plankton]{.underline} [at the
**base of the marine food web**]{.underline}. Using a climate model with
an interactive ocean, [Mills]{.underline} et al. (2014) [evaluated the
ocean physical response]{.underline} to [a potential India/Pakistan
nuclear war]{.underline} that lofts 5 Tg of black carbon particles into
the stratosphere; they find a 0.8◦ C decrease in globally averaged sea
surface temperature, with smaller temperature reductions at depth.
Recently Toon et al. (2019) used an Earth system model that includes a
[representation for phytoplankton to evaluate the ocean biological
response to nuclear conflict]{.underline}; they report a 5--15% decrease
in phytoplankton productivity under a range of conflict scenarios. Such
findings prompt further investigation into how [**nuclear conflict** and
the r**esulting global cooling** may alter the **chemical state of the
ocean**]{.underline}. Perturbations in the ocean\'s carbonate chemistry
are of particular interest, owing to their importance for ocean
acidification. Ocean acidification is an ongoing, large-scale
environmental problem driven by fossil fuel emissions of carbon dioxide
(CO2). Cumulatively since the preindustrial era, the ocean has absorbed
41% of the carbon emitted by human industrial activities (McKinley et
al., 2017). While this ocean absorption of carbon has partially
mitigated anthropogenic global warming, it has fundamentally altered the
carbonate chemistry of the ocean, increasing the concentration of
hydrogen ions (\[H+\]) while decreasing the concentration of carbonate
ions (\[CO2− 3 \]). Observations collected at time series sites across
the global ocean find statistically significant reductions in the
potential hydrogen (pH = −log(\[H+\])) and the saturation state of the
calcium carbonate mineral aragonite (Ωarag, which is proportional to
\[CO2− 3 \]) over the past few decades (Bates et al., 2014). These
changes are a direct consequence of the ocean absorption of
anthropogenic carbon; carbonate chemistry dictates that the excess
carbon will react with water and CO2− 3 to decrease ocean pH and Ω
(Feely et al., 2004). Both of these changes may have negative
consequences for marine organisms, in particular for those that
precipitate calcium carbonate shells (e.g., coccolithophores, pteropods,
foraminifera, corals, molluscs, and echinoderms), as the precipitation
is hindered by low pH, and because decreases in Ω favor shell
dissolution (Doney et al., 2009). To date, there have been no studies of
the effects of nuclear conflict on ocean acidification, though past
modeling studies on the ocean\'s response to volcanic forcing and to
proposed geoengineering schemes have intimated that [ocean carbonate
chemistry is highly sensitive to]{.underline} these types [of **external
forcings.**]{.underline} Using a fully coupled carbon-climate model,
Frölicher et al. (2011) find that volcanic-induced cooling following the
1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption led to immediate increases in the flux of
carbon from atmosphere to ocean and consequently, increases in the total
dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration in the surface ocean.
Eddebbar et al. (2019) demonstrate that air-to-sea CO2 fluxes are
significantly enhanced following the eruptions of Agung, El Chichón, and
Pinatubo in a large ensemble of simulations with an Earth system model.
Matthews et al. (2009) conduct solar radiation management climate
engineering simulations with an intermediate complexity model of the
coupled climate-carbon system; they find changes in ocean pH and Ωarag
as a result of the anomalous cooling. Similarly, Lauvset et al. (2017)
indicate that radiation management geoengineering leads to changes in
North Atlantic pH in a fully coupled Earth system model, but they do not
explore changes in Ωarag. [While]{.underline} these
[studies]{.underline} [are suggestive of the carbonate chemistry
response to nuclear conflict]{.underline}, the [external forcing
perturbations are of a different magnitude and duration than those
imposed by nuclear conflict]{.underline}. Further, it is difficult to
mechanistically understand the ocean carbonate chemistry response to
such external forcing perturbations in fully coupled models, where the
terrestrial response to forcing additionally influences the atmospheric
CO2 concentration. Here, [we use a state-of-the art Earth system model
to simulate the ocean carbonate chemistry response to a range of
**nuclear conflict scenarios**]{.underline}. [We decouple the ocean
carbon cycle from that of the terrestrial carbon cycle]{.underline} via
a direct prescription of the atmospheric CO2 boundary condition used for
air-sea CO2 flux, that is, changes in the terrestrial biosphere have no
influence on the atmospheric CO2 that the ocean sees. As we will
demonstrate, [we find large **perturbations** in **ocean pH** and Ωarag
as a **result of nuclear conflict**]{.underline}. [These]{.underline}
[perturbations]{.underline} [have relatively **long
duration**]{.underline} (order of 10 years) [and are driven by decreases
in temperature and **subsequent increases** in the **ocean carbon
inventory**.]{.underline} 2. Methods We analyse output generated by the
Community Earth System Model (CESM) version 1.3, a state-of-the-art
coupled climate model consisting of atmosphere, ocean, land, and sea ice
components (Hurrell et al., 2013). The atmosphere component of CESM in
our simulations is the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM;
Marsh et al., 2013) with nominal 2◦ resolution, 66 vertical levels, and
a model top at ∼145 km; it uses the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for
GCMs (RRTMG; Iacono et al., 2000) for the radiative transfer. The
Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (Bardeen et al.,
2008) is coupled with WACCM to simulate the injection, lofting,
advection, and removal of soot aerosols in the troposphere and
stratosphere, and their subsequent impact on climate (Coupe et al.,
2019; Toon et al., 2019). The ocean component of CESM is the Parallel
Ocean Program version 2 (Danabasoglu et al., 2012) with nominal 1◦
resolution and 60 vertical levels. The biogeochemical ocean component of
CESM is the Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling model that represents the
lower trophic levels of the marine ecosystem, full carbonate system
thermodynamics, air-sea CO2 fluxes, and a dynamic iron cycle (Doney et
al., 2006; Moore et al., 2004, 2013; Moore & Braucher, 2008; Long et
al., 2013; Lindsay et al., 2014). LOVENDUSKI ET AL. 2 of 9 Geophysical
Research Letters 10.1029/2019GL086246 The ocean in the coupled CESM
simulation is initialized from rest with World Ocean Circulation (WOCE)
temperature and salinity (Gouretski & Koltermann, 2004). Biogeochemical
tracers are initialized to observationally based climatologies where
possible (Lauvset et al., 2016); where these were not available (such as
dissolved iron and phytoplankton biomass), the model is initialized with
fields interpolated from an existing CESM simulation. The new, fully
coupled simulation was spun up for 4 years to an approximate steady
state with a constant atmospheric CO2 mixing ratio of 370 ppm,
representative of the mixing ratio in the year 2000. Due to the
relatively short spin-up period, the globally integrated air-sea CO2
flux is not in steady state (drifting at a rate of 0.14 Pg C year−2)
when the perturbation forcing is applied. We therefore present our
results as anomalies from the drifting control integrations. Three
control simulations of 20-year duration are generated using round-off
level differences in atmospheric initial conditions. As each of these
control simulations has different phasing of internal variability (e.g.,
El Niño-Southern Oscillation), we use the standard deviation across this
ensemble to identify statistically significant perturbations due to
nuclear conflict. We report on the anomalies generated from four
simulations of nuclear conflict with varying amounts of soot injection:
three India/Pakistan conflict scenarios that inject 5, 27, and 47 Tg of
soot, respectively, and one US/Russia conflict scenario that injects 150
Tg of soot. The initial soot injection amounts are generated from
plausible scenarios for nuclear conflict following advice from a number
of military and policy experts; the reader is referred to Toon et al.
(2019) for further details on scenario development. In each case, we
prescribe that the conflict begins on 15 May of the 5th year of the
first control simulation, and we integrate the model for a 15-year
period following the injection. We assume that the smoke generated by
mass fires from nuclear conflict is injected into the upper troposphere
above the target sites (in the U. S./Russia case, smoke is spread evenly
over the two nations), as in Toon et al. (2019). WACCM lofts much of
this smoke higher into the stratosphere via solar heating of black
carbon aerosols in the smoke, where the black carbon aerosols persist
for about a decade. The resulting annual mean, post-conflict (May to the
following April) anomalies in aerosol optical depth are shown in Figure
1a. These optical depth changes result in a 10--40% reduction in
incoming solar energy (Toon et al., 2019). While we discuss the
anomalies generated from all four of these conflict simulations, we
describe two in greater detail throughout this manuscript: the U.
S./Russia case, as it is the largest climate perturbation overall, and
the India/Pakistan 47-Tg case, as it is the largest climate perturbation
generated by a regional nuclear conflict. Ocean biogeochemistry in the
version of CESM used for our simulations has been extensively validated
in the literature (Brady et al., 2019; Freeman et al., 2018; Harrison et
al., 2018; Krumhardt et al., 2017; Lindsay et al., 2014; Lovenduski et
al., 2015, 2016; Long et al., 2013, 2016; Moore et al., 2013; McKinley
et al., 2016; Negrete-García et al., 2019). Of particular note for our
study, the simulated surface ocean carbonate ion concentration from a
long, preindustrial control simulation of CESM compares favorably with
reconstructed observations, albeit with lower interannual variance than
has been measured at subtropical time series sites (Lovenduski et al.,
2015). In Figure S1 in the supporting information, we illustrate the
comparison between observationally based estimates of surface ocean pH
and Ωarag (from GLODAPv2; Lauvset et al., 2016) and the CESM control
ensemble mean. In this comparison, we note that the observational
estimates have been extensively interpolated and are intended to
represent year 2002 carbonate chemistry parameters, whereas CESM has
been integrated under an atmospheric CO2 mixing ratio that corresponds
to year 2000 forcing. We find high correspondence between the spatial
patterns of modeled and observed pH and Ωarag, giving us confidence that
CESM is capable of representing the mean state of these two variables.
3. Results Globally averaged surface ocean pH increases in response to
each of the nuclear conflicts, where the magnitude of the pH anomaly
scales with the amount of soot injected (Figure 1b). In each case, the
pH anomaly exceeds the interannual standard deviation of pH in the
control ensemble mean (gray shading in Figure 1b). We observe the
largest increases in surface ocean pH in response to the U. S./Russia
150-Tg case; here the globally averaged surface ocean pH anomaly exceeds
0.05, corresponding to a ∼10% decrease in the global mean hydrogen ion
concentration. Under each scenario, the pH anomaly peaks 2--4 years
after the conflict and persists for ∼10 years. With the exception of the
high-latitude oceans, the pH increase following the nuclear conflict is
pervasive across the surface ocean (Figures 2a-- 2c). In the 47-Tg
India/Pakistan scenario, we observe local pH anomalies exceeding 0.06
units on average in years 2--5 post conflict (Figure 2c); the anomalies
are largest in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Equatorial
Pacific. These large, abrupt changes in surface ocean pH may have
important consequences for calcifying organisms, as shell precipitation
can be affected by the ambient hydrogen ion concentration in seawater
(Kroeker et al., 2013). Since the beginning of the industrial
revolution, global ocean pH has dropped by an estimated 0.1 units (Ciais
& Sabine, 2013). The anomalies in pH generated by our simulations exceed
50% of this historical change and occur over a much shorter time period.
Whether and how organisms respond to the initial and rapid alleviation
of low pH, followed by an immediate return to the current pH state in
the global ocean, is as yet unknown (see, e.g., Haigh et al., 2015). In
contrast to our results for pH, we observe decreases in surface ocean
Ωarag following nuclear conflict (Figure 1c), which should tend to
inhibit the maintenance of shells and skeletons in calcified organisms.
While minimal changes in Ωarag are simulated for the 5-Tg India/Pakistan
case, the other three cases produce large decreases in saturation state,
on the order of 0.1 to 0.3 units (Figure 1c). In each of these three
cases, the anomalies exceed the interannual standard deviation of Ωarag
in the control ensemble mean (gray shading in Figure 1c). The peak
response in these three cases occurs 3--5 years post conflict, a year or
so later than the pH response. While for pH the globally averaged
anomaly is negligibly small, 10-years post conflict; anomalies in
globally averaged Ωarag persist beyond our 15-year simulation time frame
for all conflict scenarios. The decreases in aragonite saturation state
span the tropics and subtropics, with the exception of the central and
eastern Equatorial Pacific region (Figures 2d-- 2f). Local decreases in
saturation state exceed 0.5 units in the western North Atlantic and
western North Pacific under the 47-Tg India/Pakistan scenario (Figure
2f). Importantly, the simulated decreases in saturation state are highly
pronounced in regions that host diverse coral reef ecosystems (for
instance, the western and southwestern Pacific and the Caribbean), and
like pH, the changes in saturation state occur fairly rapidly.
Projections from climate models suggest that coral reef ecosystems
across the world will experience aragonite saturation state declines
from their preindustrial value of 3.5 to 3.0 by the end of the century
(Ricke et al., 2013); alarmingly, our simulations project similar Ωarag
declines over a 3- to 5-year period, which then persist for years after
the initial forcing dissipates. The opposite-signed anomalies in pH and
Ωarag induced by nuclear conflict seem puzzling at first, as for
\"typical\" anthropogenic ocean acidification scenarios, both of these
variables simultaneously decrease. Why would nuclear conflict cause
opposing responses in pH and saturation state? To understand these
opposing responses, we need to consider the carbonate chemistry system
in seawater and its sensitivity to changing temperature. Gaseous CO2
reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), which then
dissociates to form H+ and bicarbonate (HCO− 3 ). The hydrogen ion then
reacts with CO2− 3 to form additional HCO− 3 , CO2 + H2O−
↽−−−−−−⇀−H2CO3. (1) H2CO3− ↽−−−−−−⇀−H+ + HCO− 3 . (2) H+ + CO2− 3 −
↽−−−−−−⇀−HCO− 3 . (3) The equilibrium constants for these reactions
(typically expressed as K0, K1, and K2, respectively; Sarmiento &
Gruber, 2006) are sensitive to changes in temperature, for example, the
cooling induced by nuclear conflict. We need to also consider the
dissolution reaction for mineral calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in seawater,
CaCO3(s)− ↽−−−−−−⇀−Ca2+ sat + CO2− 3,sat, (4) where \[Ca2+\]sat and
\[CO2− 3 \]sat are the concentrations of dissolved calcium and carbonate
in equilibrium with mineral CaCO3, and the solubility product (Ksp) for
this reaction is also sensitive to temperature (Sarmiento & Gruber,
2006). Further, the saturation state for a calcium carbonate mineral in
seawater (here: aragonite), can be expressed as Ωarag = \[Ca2+\]\[CO2− 3
\] Ksp , (5) where both \[CO2− 3 \] and Ksp are affected by changes in
temperature (Ca2+ is highly abundant in seawater, and thus changes in
temperature do not affect its concentration enough to matter for CaCO3
dissolution; Emerson & Hedges, 2008; Sarmiento & Gruber, 2006). Thus, we
can decompose the anomalies in pH and Ωarag into the component driven by
temperature-induced changes in the carbonate chemistry equilibrium
constants (K0, K1, K2, and Ksp) and the component driven by all other
changes to the carbonate chemistry system, such as changes in the DIC
concentration, the alkalinity, or the salinity. We approximate the
temperature sensitivity of the equilibrium constants using a program
developed for CO2 system calculations (CO2SYS; van Heuven et al., 2011)
via finite difference approximation. The component driven by all other
changes to the carbonate system is computed as the residual of the other
two terms. The pH response to nuclear conflict is the sum of two
opposing drivers: an increase in pH driven by a decrease in sea surface
temperature that alters the carbonate chemistry equilibrium constants
and a decrease in pH driven by an increase in the DIC concentration of
the upper ocean. Figure 1b illustrates the temporal evolution of the
components of the global pH anomalies from the India/Pakistan 47-Tg
simulation driven by changes in the equilibrium constants versus all
other changes in the carbonate chemistry system. The equilibrium
constant-driven pH anomaly is positive, peaking 2--3 years after the
conflict, whereas the "other" component of the pH anomaly is negative,
peaking 3--5 years after the conflict. The resulting total pH anomaly is
positive, indicating that it is more strongly influenced by changes in
the equilibrium constants than other changes. In the India/Pakistan
47-Tg case, globally averaged temperature reaches a minimum 2 to 3-years
post conflict; the model initially produces 3.5◦C--4◦C anomalies at the
surface that rewarm toward pre-conflict values for the duration of the
simulation (Figure 3a). In contrast, surface ocean salinity-normalized
DIC anomalies peak 3 to 5-years post conflict (Figure 3b), mainly as a
result of the enhanced solubility of CO2 in colder seawater. While
decreasing biological export production also contributes to increased
DIC in the surface ocean, this signal is small relative to the change
driven by enhanced air-to-sea CO2 flux (e.g., Figure S2). The delay in
DIC relative to temperature anomalies is a result of the long (order
months to years) timescale for CO2 to fully equilibrate with the surface
mixed layer (Emerson & Hedges, 2008). The cold, high DIC surface
anomalies slowly propagate into the global ocean thermocline; we observe
1◦ C and 10 mmol m−3 anomalies in temperature and DIC, respectively, at
a depth of 300 m that persist beyond the length of our simulation
(Figure 3). As there are no significant anomalies in global mean
alkalinity or salinity post conflict (not shown), we conclude that the
DIC perturbation drives the "other" component of the pH anomalies. We
find similar behavior for these components in the other conflict
scenarios (not shown). The negative Ωarag anomalies post conflict are
driven by a combination of lower temperatures and higher DIC
concentrations. Colder surface temperatures tend to increase Ksp, while
higher surface DIC concentrations tend to decrease \[CO2− 3 \],
resulting in lower Ωarag values post conflict. Figure 1c illustrates
that the DIC (other) component dominates the total Ωarag anomaly for the
India/Pakistan 47-Tg simulation. As for pH, the equilibrium constant
component peaks earlier than the other component; this is due to the
timing of the temperature and DIC perturbations (Figure 3). The spatial
patterns of the post-conflict surface pH and Ωarag anomalies in the
India/Pakistan 47-Tg scenario (Figures 2c and 2f) result from
perturbations in local surface ocean temperature and DIC (Figure S3).
Negative temperature anomalies and positive DIC anomalies are pervasive
in the tropics and extratropics, with the exception of the eastern
Equatorial Pacific, where a large and long-lasting El Niño-like event
develops following the conflict (Coupe, et al., manuscript in review).
This strong reduction in the equatorial trade winds greatly weakens
upwelling in the cold tongue region, producing near-zero surface
temperature anomalies and a reduction in vertical DIC supply here
(Figure S3). In the Southern Ocean, temperature and DIC are not much
affected by the nuclear conflict, likely a result of enhanced upwelling
of warm water from the subsurface (Harrison, et al., manuscript in
preparation). Taken together, the aforementioned changes in temperature
and DIC lead to increases in pH and decreases in Ωarag over most of the
ocean surface (Figure S4). The changes in surface ocean pH that we
simulate for nuclear conflict resemble the simulated response of pH to
volcanic eruptions, but are an order of magnitude larger. Figure S5
illustrates the anomaly in surface ocean pH in the first year following
the eruptions of Agung, El Chichón, and Mt. Pinatubo, as estimated by
the CESM Large Ensemble (Kay et al., 2015), which uses the same physical
and biogeochemical ocean components as in our nuclear conflict
simulations. The ensemble mean isolates the evolution of the Earth
system under historical external forcing, including the aerosol loading
following volcanic eruptions (Eddebbar et al., 2019), and averages
across the various representations of internal variability (Deser et
al., 2012; we note that ensembles are not necessary for the nuclear
conflict scenarios since the much larger magnitude of forcing provides a
higher signal-to-noise ratio). The anomaly in the ensemble mean shown
here thus cleanly captures the response of surface ocean pH to volcanic
eruptions. Here we show the anomaly in preindustrial pH (pH anomalies in
equilibrium with preindustrial atmospheric CO2, which is computed
simultaneously with contemporary pH at model run time), as the
contemporary pH anomalies include also the response to increasing
atmospheric CO2 from one year to the next. The similarity in the spatial
patterns of volcanically induced pH anomalies and those produced under
nuclear conflict is striking (cf. Figures S5 and 2c), suggesting that
volcanic forcing produces similar temperature, DIC, and thus pH
anomalies (including the El Niño-like response to volcanic forcing in
the eastern Equatorial Pacific, described in Eddebbar et al., 2019).
However, the eruption-driven pH anomaly is both smaller (an order of
magnitude) and of shorter duration (∼2 years) than in the India/Pakistan
47-Tg simulation. Unfortunately, a similar analysis of volcanic Ωarag
anomalies in the CESM Large Ensemble was not possible as preindustrial
\[CO2− 3 \] was not saved to disk. 4. Conclusions and Discussion We
report on the surface ocean pH and Ωarag anomalies generated from four
simulations of nuclear conflict using the CESM with full ocean carbonate
system thermodynamics. Globally averaged surface ocean pH increases in
response to each conflict, with the largest increases in the North
Atlantic, North Pacific, and Equatorial Pacific Ocean. The [pH
anomalies]{.underline} [persist for **10 years post conflict** and are
primarily driven by]{.underline} changes in the carbonate chemistry
equilibrium constants as a result of decreases in sea surface
temperature. In contrast, CESM simulates globally averaged decreases in
surface ocean Ωarag in response to nuclear conflict, with the largest
decreases in the tropics and subtropics. The Ωarag anomalies persist
beyond the length of our 15-year simulations and are driven by a
combination of changes in the carbonate chemistry equilibrium constants
and the solubility-driven increases in DIC. We further demonstrate that
the surface pH anomalies induced by nuclear conflict resemble those
induced by volcanic eruptions in the same modeling system.
[The]{.underline} simulated [changes in global and regional
pH]{.underline} and [Ωarag as a **result of nuclear conflict** are
**large and abrupt.**]{.underline} In the most extreme forcing scenario
(U. S./Russia 150 Tg), over a period of ∼5 years, global surface ocean
pH increases by 0.06 units, and Ωarag decreases by 0.3 units. To put
these numbers into perspective, this simulated rate of change of pH is
10 times larger than the rate of change we have observed over the past
two decades as a result of ocean acidification (−0.0018 year−1; Lauvset
et al., 2015). Worryingly, surface ocean Ωarag decreases more than six
times faster than has been observed in the open ocean over the past
three decades (−0.0095 year−1 at the Bermuda Atlantic time series; Bates
et al., 2014). [While the cooling associated with nuclear conflict
rapidly and briefly alleviates the decline in pH associated with ocean
acidification]{.underline}, the [increase in solubility causes the ocean
to absorb]{.underline} ∼11 Pg of excess carbon in a 10-year period,
leading to a rapid drop in Ωarag. Whether and how calcifying organisms
might respond to such rapid and opposing changes in pH and Ωarag is as
yet unknown. In order to measure organism response to ocean
acidification, a majority of laboratory studies perform CO2 bubbling
perturbation experiments, which simultaneously decrease the pH and Ωarag
in the surrounding seawater solution (Pörtner et al., 2014). This
simultaneous change in two carbonate chemistry parameters challenges our
ability to isolate the organism response to changes in pH or changes in
Ωarag alone. A recent laboratory sensitivity study of marine bivalve
larvae used chemical manipulation experiments to decouple these two
parameters; they found that larval shell development and growth were
negatively impacted by decreasing Ω and unaffected by changes in pH
(Waldbusser et al., 2014). If these sensitivities are sustained in other
organisms, we might conclude that [calcifying]{.underline} [organisms
would be **severely affected by nuclear conflict**]{.underline}. Our
findings shed light on the ocean biogeochemical response to other forms
of extreme external forcing, such as volcanic eruptions (Eddebbar et
al., 2019; Frölicher et al., 2011) and solar radiation management
climate engineering (Lauvset et al., 2017; Matthews et al., 2009). They
may further inform the study and understanding of the role of ocean
acidification in marine extinction following the Chicxulub impact event
(Henehan et al., 2019). [Importantly]{.underline}, [our results suggest
that even a **regional nuclear conflict** can have an **impact on global
ocean acidification**]{.underline}, [adding to the list of
the]{.underline} many, [far-reaching consequences of nuclear conflict
for global society]{.underline}.

#### Specifically, cyber-attacks on space-based sensors cause total failure of missile defense systems 

Beyza **Unal 19**, Ph.D., senior research fellow with the International
Security Department at Chatham House, July 2019, "Cybersecurity of
NATO's Space-based Strategic Assets,"
<https://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/cybersecurity-nato-s-space-based-strategic-assets/2019-06-27-Space-Cybersecurity-2.pdf>

[Missile defence relies heavily on early warning
capabilities]{.underline} otherwise known as integrated threat warning
and threat assessment (ITW/TA): [**US space-based infrared sensors**
detect the hot plumes of ballistic missile launches and communicate the
information to the service component command]{.underline}.

[Theatre missile defence]{.underline}, which includes the Patriot
missile defence system -- a long-range surface-to-air missile system
used by the US and NATO allies -- [and standard missile defence
systems]{.underline}, and which is [part of the]{.underline} naval
component of the [integrated Aegis weapon system]{.underline}, also
[serves as part of overall missile defence capability]{.underline}.45
The [Aegis]{.underline} combat system [operates in the maritime domain,
using radar to track and guide weapons to destroy targets; its elements
-- which include a space tracking and surveillance system]{.underline},
the AN/SPY-1A radar, [a command and decision system and a display system
-- could **all potentially be exposed to cyberattacks**]{.underline}.

The US Department of Defense conducted an auditing exercise in 2018 for
the internal controls of its ballistic missile defence systems (BMDS).
The aim of the audit was to ensure that systems and programmes were
functioning as intended. The findings indicated that there were
'internal control weaknesses related to protecting networks and systems
that process, store, and transmit BMDS technical information'.46 These
[weaknesses could be exploited through insider threat and/or cyber
means]{.underline}.

[Missile defence systems may fail, or they may be activated due to false
**info**rmation sent from communication systems]{.underline} (such as
ground-based radars) [to the command unit]{.underline}. The Israeli
anti-missile defence system Iron Dome, for example, is claimed to have a
90 per cent accuracy rate when intercepting targets. Yet there have been
cases where a faulty response within the system has activated the launch
of interceptor missiles erroneously, such as occurred in Gaza in March
2018, when it was triggered by machine gun fire.47 Thus the battle
management and weapons control system was proved at that time to be
unable to make proper threat assessments. Similar outcomes could result
if the threat assessment control system is interfered with via cyber
means; the consequences could be much higher, including the loss of
civilian life. In the Israeli case, it was reported that Rafael Advanced
Defense Systems, a supplier of technology to the Iron Dome system,
together with Israel Aerospace Industries and the Elisra Group, both of
which were also involved in the project, faced persistent cyberattacks
during the period of October 2011 to August 2012. This resulted in the
loss of sensitive data that was believed to include the specifications
of the Arrow 3 missile, developed jointly by the US and Israel.48
Vulnerability to cyberattacks within the supply chain is not unique to
NATO, and NATO and its allies should address this type of risk. Supply
chain integrity (in terms of both hardware and software) is imperative
for reliable military systems.

[One of the core elements of a missile defence system is that it relies
on the reception of **near real-time information** by a command centre
to be able to identify and project the trajectory of an incoming
missile. Through automated response it calculates the speed, velocity
and location of the target]{.underline} in order [to be able to
intercept the incoming missile]{.underline} in a short time frame.
[**Any deliberate interference** with the information]{.underline}, for
instance from the radar, [could mean]{.underline} that [the defence
missiles **fail to intercept**]{.underline} an incoming threat, [or
could lead to a faulty decision based on falsified or spoofed
information]{.underline}. Thus, for example, [a defence missile could
fail to hit the correct target and strike well beyond the intended
target zone]{.underline}. In order to detect deliberate interference or
cyber intrusion, it is important to put preventive measures in place.
One such measure could be to conduct organized, simulated cyberattacks
on a system to assess its performance: this is known as penetration
testing. In the future, detection of anomalies could be possible through
ML and AI, especially in closed networks.49

#### Missile defense is key to deter North Korea -- failure of missile defense causes North Korean nuclear attack

Vince A. **Manzo** AND John K. **Warden 21,** a Research Analyst with
the Strategic Initiatives Group at the Center for Naval Analysis (CNA);

"WANT TO AVOID NUCLEAR WAR? REJECT MUTUAL VULNERABILITY WITH NORTH
KOREA"; War On the Rocks;
https://warontherocks.com/2017/08/want-to-avoid-nuclear-war-reject-mutual-vulnerability-with-north-korea/

The North Korea policy of the Donald Trump administration has been mired
in a morass of contradiction and bluster. But there might be a silver
lining: There is an indication that [the administration
will]{.underline} follow its predecessors and [attempt to deny North
Korea the ability to hold the United States at risk with nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. If effectively implemented as a part of a
comprehensive deterrence strategy, [this approach would give the United
States and its allies the best chance of containing a nuclear-armed
North Korea]{.underline} and avoiding nuclear war.

In their attempts to formulate an effective strategy, the previous two
administrations articulated an important strategic principle: [The
United States will attempt to deny North Korea the ability to hold the
U.S. homeland at risk with nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic
missiles (]{.underline}ICBMs). This is not, however, the same as saying
that the United States will prevent North Korea from testing an ICBM or
deploying an operational ICBM force, a goal that does not seem possible
without paying an unacceptable cost. Rather, [the principle is a signal
of U.S. intent to deny North Korea the ability to use the threat of
nuclear strikes against the U.S. homeland as coercive
leverage]{.underline}.

[The **most visible** and expensive element of this policy is the U.S.
Ground-Based Midcourse Defense **(GMD) system**]{.underline}. Initiated
under President George W. Bush's administration in 2002 and expanded by
President Barack Obama in 2013, [the GMD system is designed to defend
against North Korean]{.underline} and Iranian [ICBMs]{.underline}. The
U.S. decision to deploy this system demonstrates that, from a strategic
planning perspective, [the United States saw a North Korean ICBM as a
distinct possibility and took steps to ensure that extended deterrence
to Japan and South Korea would remain viable even if North Korea
deployed a nuclear-capable missile]{.underline} that could range the
continental United States.

By seeking to reduce vulnerability to a North Korean nuclear attack on
the U.S. homeland, [the United States has placed North Korea in a
different category than Russia]{.underline}. (Where China should fit is
a matter of debate[.) Washington accepts that "mutual vulnerability"
to]{.underline} nuclear attack [is an enduring reality of its
relationship with Moscow]{.underline}. In other words, the United States
assesses that neither it nor Russia has the ability to disarm a
considerable portion of the other's nuclear weapons capability and
prevent a significant retaliatory strike. Furthermore, as a matter of
policy, the United States does not seek to develop strike and missile
defense capabilities that would deny Russia a survivable nuclear
second-strike capability.

Part of the reason the United States has accepted mutual vulnerability
with Russia is that it wants to avoid first-strike instability. The
traditional concept of first-strike instability reasons that a
nuclear-armed country would have a strong incentive to launch a first
strike against its nuclear-armed adversary in a crisis if, first, doing
so would enable it to generate an advantage by destroying a significant
portion of its adversary's nuclear forces and, second, its adversary
also has an incentive to strike first and limit damage before its own
forces are degraded or destroyed. In other words, nuclear deterrence
could fail in a crisis if one or both sides were to perceive that both
the potential payoff of attacking and the risk of delaying or
restraining are high.

Importantly, [the **use-them-or-lose-them logic** of classical
first-strike instability **does not apply** to the **U.S.-North Korea**
nuclear relationship]{.underline}. In a crisis or conflict, [North Korea
would certainly fear for the survivability of its nuclear
forces]{.underline} and potentially its regime. [But even once North
Korea's nuclear force grows larger]{.underline} and more sophisticated,
[Pyongyang could not conceivably hope to generate an advantage by
conducting a damage-limiting nuclear first strike against the United
States]{.underline}. Such a strike would not significantly degrade U.S.
nuclear forces or overall war potential and would ensure the end of the
Kim regime. This is in no way a "dominant strategic move" for North
Korea.

[How then, could the United States fail to deter North Korean nuclear
use]{.underline}? Pyongyang knows that it cannot use nuclear weapons and
other capabilities to defeat U.S. and allied military forces. Instead,
Kim Jong Un's more plausible theory of victory is a strategy that
attempts to use nuclear coercion to persuade the United States that the
costs and risks of overthrowing the Kim regime are too high. In this
sense, [North Korea's initial attempt at asymmetric escalation using
nuclear weapons is more likely to be a limited strike against regional
military targets than a massive strike against the continental United
States]{.underline}. Pyongyang would attempt to degrade the ability of
the U.S. to flow forces to the Korean Peninsula, while demonstrating a
propensity for controlled risk-taking. But critically, North Korea would
retain a survivable reserve nuclear force to threaten destruction of
major U.S. population centers if the United States does not back down.

[From this perspective, accepting U.S. vulnerability to North Korean
nuclear forces would improve the credibility of North Korea's coercive
strategy and **increase the risk** of both war and **nuclear
use**]{.underline}. [If Kim Jong Un is confident that North Korea
can]{.underline} maintain a survivable reserve force that can [threaten
U.S. cities, he may be tempted to **use nuclear weapons**]{.underline}
[in a limited, coercive fashion to try to terminate a conventional
conflict]{.underline} with the United States and its allies. Rather than
use-or-lose, [the logic driving North Korean first use would be, use
some because you will not lose the rest]{.underline}. Even more
unsettling, [if Pyongyang became confident in its ability to use nuclear
coercion as a war termination mechanism, it might conclude that it has
leeway to initiate violent provocations and even war.]{.underline}

[Thus,]{.underline} rather than accepting North Korea's ability to cause
significant destruction to the United States with a nuclear strike, [the
United States should field damage limitation capabilities]{.underline},
a combination of strike [and missile defense armaments that would allow
the United States to disarm the majority of North Korea's nuclear
weapons capability]{.underline} [and prevent significant retaliatory
strikes against U.S. cities.]{.underline} [If the United States has a
credible damage limitation option, the Kim regime is more likely to
calculate that **crossing the nuclear threshold** would be **a strategy
for suicide**]{.underline}, not survival, because North Korea would lack
a reliable second-strike capability to deter regime change.

[In order for U.S. damage-limitation capabilities to match North Korea's
rapidly improving long-range missile capabilities]{.underline}, [there
is an urgent need to improve U.S. homeland defense]{.underline}. The GMD
system has well-documented limitations, and the Trump administration
should make prudent investments to fix the program, emphasizing the need
for cost-effective, reliable capabilities. In addition, the United
States and its allies should field a combination of intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance and strike capabilities that can
threaten North Korea's road-mobile transporter erector launchers and
ballistic-missile submarines.

#### Satellites are key to overall cyber-vulnerability of critical infrastructure\-\--attacks risk blackouts and collapse crisis response and deterrence relationships 

Patricia **Lewis 16**, research director for international security at
Chatham House; and David Livingstone, associate fellow for international
security at Chatham House, 11/21/16, "The cyber threat in outer space,"
https://thebulletin.org/2016/11/the-cyber-threat-in-outer-space/

[**Sat**ellite**s**]{.underline} that orbit the Earth [form the
exoskeleton of the **world's critical infrastructure**. Global
**comm**unication**s**, air transport, maritime trade, financial
services, weather and environmental monitoring, and defense
systems]{.underline} all [depend on an expansive network of
**sat**ellite**s**]{.underline} in space. As the September 2014 cyber
attack on the US weather system starkly demonstrated, the [strategic
space-based assets]{.underline} of America and other nations [have
**serious cyber vulnerabilities**]{.underline}. In the maritime arena
too, space-based monitoring systems are regularly being jammed or
spoofed by vessel operators entering false information in order to
disguise their illicit activities.

The [vulnerability of satellites]{.underline}, their ground stations,
and other space assets [to cyber attack is often **overlooked** in wider
discussions of cyber threats to **c**ritical **n**ational
**i**nfrastructure. Yet]{.underline} just as with other digital
networked systems, satellites are vulnerable to cyber attacks that
include data theft, jamming, spoofing, and satellite hijacking. All of
[these present serious risks for societies and critical infrastructures,
and analyzing the intersection between cyber security and space security
is essential to understanding this evolving problem. So too is the need
for an **ogranized global effort to confront these
threats**]{.underline}. Despite some progress at the United Nations and
elsewhere, there is currently no international body dedicated to the
issue of cyber security in space. Establishing such a multi-stakeholder
regime, with the aim of assessing risks and promoting best practices,
would begin to close this critical gap.

The nature of the threat. Cyber risks for space-based systems take many
forms. While one attack might involve the jamming, spoofing, or hacking
of communications or navigational networks, another might target or
hijack control systems or specific electronics for missions, shutting
down satellites, altering their orbits, or "grilling" their solar cells
through deliberate exposure to damaging radiation. Still another might
strike at satellite control centers on the ground.

As in other areas of cyber conflict, players and motivations abound.
States or non-state armed groups could use such attacks to create
military advantages in space prior to or during a war. Government
agencies or corporations with sufficient computing power to crack
encryption codes could use cyber attacks on satellite systems to steal
strategic quantities of intellectual property. Well-resourced criminal
organizations could steal significant amounts of cash. Groups or even
[governments could initiate catastrophic levels of satellite run-ins
with space debris]{.underline}, perhaps [even causing]{.underline} a
cascade of collisions---called **[the Kessler
Effect]{.underline}**---[that could deny everyone the use of space for
the foreseeable future]{.underline}. Even individual hackers who simply
want to show off their skills could create inadvertent mayhem.

Perhaps [the most worrying vulnerabilities involve satellite-enabled
navigational systems]{.underline}. Many such systems have been
developed, from Europe (notably the new Galileo system) to Asia, but the
most ubiquitous is the US global-positioning system commonly known as
GPS. [**Much of the world's infrastructure** relies on this system, yet
it was not originally intended for civilian use, and therefore not
designed with security in mind. A successful spoofing cyber attack could
introduce erroneous timing signals]{.underline}, which are used for
determining precise locations. [Aimed at a power grid, this type of
manipulation could]{.underline} potentially [**trigger catastrophic
overloads**, leading to cascading equipment failures and even major
blackouts. Spoofers could]{.underline} also [target banks and stock
exchanges by manipulating automated time-stamps on
transactions]{.underline}. Earlier this year, when 15 satellites
accidentally broadcast signals that were inaccurate by 13 microseconds,
telecom companies using Chronos GPS services were hit with 12 hours of
thousands of system errors.

The [threat to military technology looms large]{.underline} as well. Not
enough attention has been paid, at least not in the open literature, to
the increasing vulnerability of space-based assets, ground stations, and
associated command-and-control systems. [Cyber attacks on
**sat**ellite**s** have the potential to **undermine the integrity of
strategic-weapons systems** and **destabilize deterrence
relationships**]{.underline}. And [in the event of a military crisis,
the potential for cyber attacks could cast doubt on **intel**ligence and
increase the risk of misperception, not to mention **threaten missile
systems**]{.underline}, both strategic and tactical, [which rely on
satellites and the space infrastructure for navigation and targeting,
command and control, operational monitoring, and other
functions]{.underline}. Because cyber technologies are within the grasp
of most states and non-state actors, they level the strategic field and
create hitherto unparalleled opportunities for small belligerent
governments or terrorist groups to instigate high-impact attacks.

Your smart fridge isn't helping. As satellites and satellite
constellations continue to grow in number---a very good thing in terms
of human connectedness, scientific research, and space exploration---so
do entry points and communications pathways for cyber attacks, the
so-called Internet of Things (or, as we now like to think of it,
Gadgnet) that has sprung up due to our love of digital devices. Yet
cyber defenses have failed to keep up with this growth, mostly due to
the high cost of (optional) built-in security in a world of smaller and
cheaper satellites, even though this is ultimately the most
cost-effective and sustainable approach to cyber safety in space.

The international supply chain of satellite components, with the
associated uncertainties about provenance and standards of production,
along with back-door holes in encryption, is increasingly hard to
regulate. The costs associated with cyber security, in both software and
hardware, are rising, and in low-cost space missions where the
commercial price of implementing security measures rivals the value of
the mission, the temptation to neglect them and hope for the best is
high. In the rush to get products to market, designers and manufacturers
often skip or pay only passing attention to important security controls.
This is already causing immense concern for machine designers,
manufacturers, and insurance companies. Indeed, the October 2016 Dyn
attack that resulted in denial-of-service strikes on major websites such
as Twitter, Spotify, and Reddit appears to have harnessed botnets on
personal computers through poorly secured home devices connected to each
other and the outside world through wireless routers.

Reducing risks, building resilience. The 2011 US International Strategy
for Cyberspace stressed that **[international approaches and cooperation
are needed]{.underline}** in order [to address and mitigate the full
range of cyber threats to military systems]{.underline}, and indeed
[international cooperation will be **crucial in any response to
space-based cyber threats**]{.underline}, both military and civilian.

attacks**]{.underline}, etc.5

As briefly discussed in Sec. III.C, the probability of a GMD of the
magnitude of the 1859 Carrington Event is now believed to be on the
order of 1%/year. The Earth narrowly missed (by only several days)
intercepting a CME stream in July 2012 that would have created a GMD
equal to or larger than the Carrington Event.41 Lloyd's, in its 2013
report, "Solar Storm Risk to the North American Electric Grid," 42
stated the following: "A Carrington-level, extreme geomagnetic storm is
almost inevitable in the future...The total U.S. population at risk of
extended power outage from a Carrington-level storm is between 20-40
million, with durations of 16 days to 1-2 years...The total economic
cost for such a scenario is estimated at \$0.6-2.6 trillion USD."
Analyses conducted subsequent to the Lloyd's assessment indicated the
geographical area impacted by the CME would be larger than that
estimated in Lloyd's analysis (extending farther northward along the New
England coast of the United States and in the state of Minnesota),43 and
that the actual consequences of such an event could actually be greater
than estimated by Lloyd's.

Based on "Report of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United
States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack: Critical National
Infrastructures" to Congress in 2008 (Ref. 39), a HEMP attack over the
Central U.S. could impact virtually the entire North American continent.
The consequences of such an event are difficult to quantify with
confidence. Experts affiliated with the aforementioned Commission and
others familiar with the details of the Commission's work have stated in
Congressional testimony that [such an event could "kill up to **90
percent of the national population** through **starvation**,
**disease**, and **societal collapse**]{.underline}." 44,45 Most of
[these consequences are either **direct** or **indirect impacts** of the
**predicted collapse**]{.underline} [of virtually the
enti]{.underline}re U.S. **[Critical Infrastructure
system]{.underline}** in the wake of the attack.

Last, recent analyses by both the U.S. Department of Energy46 and the
U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine47 have
concluded that **[cyber threats]{.underline}** to the U.S. Grid from
both state-level and substatelevel entities [are likely to grow in
**number and sophistication**]{.underline} in the coming years, [posing
a]{.underline} **[growing threat]{.underline}** to the U.S. Grid.

[These three "very bad day" scenarios are not **creations** of
**overzealous science fiction writers**]{.underline}. A variety of
mitigating actions to reduce both the vulnerability and the consequences
of these events has been identified, and some are being implemented.
However, the fact remains that events such as those described here have
the potential to change life as we know it in the United States and
other developed nations in the 21st century, whether the events occur
individually, or simultaneously, and with or without coordinated
physical attacks on Critical Infrastructure assets.

#### A [fractured governance framework]{.underline} for space that has been oriented around [individual countries]{.underline}, not a [collective defense]{.underline}, emboldens Chinese attacks that drive escalation -- US-NATO military cooperation over space hardens [civilian targets]{.underline}, improves [dialogue]{.underline} around safeguards, and centralizes [info networks]{.underline}.

NATO in Cyber and Outer Space

[**Cyber** and **space** is a promising arena for NATO to address China
challenges by building **member state resilience**]{.underline}. Like
the air and sea domains, as areas that belong to no one state and which
provide access to much of the globe, they form part of the global
commons. Command of the commons has been the key enabler of the US
global position of power for many decades.26 However, [China wields a
sufficient range of]{.underline} sea, air, [**cyber**, and **space**
capabilities]{.underline} such that the global commons is now a
contested zone. In contrast to the sea and air domains, cyber and space
are sparsely regulated. This [lack of international norms enhances the
**risk of conflict** based on **misperception**, making NATO cooperation
pertinent]{.underline}. Adversarial activities toward the US and Europe
in the cyber and space domain threaten transatlantic security. These
come not just from China, but also from other adversaries such as Russia
and Iran. [Mechanisms for]{.underline} addressing these
[challenges]{.underline} in the military sector [are essentially generic
and not]{.underline}, at least in their basic design, [established with
a **particular country** in mind]{.underline}. Thus, [cyber and space
provide an avenue for NATO to contribute]{.underline} significantly [to
**deterrence** of China without]{.underline} having to combat **[major
internal resistance]{.underline}**. NATO would also benefit from
long-standing US-EU cooperation on cyber and space issues.27

Cyber and space provide an avenue for NATO to contribute without major
internal resistance

[NATO has vowed to clarify **Article Five's** collective defense
commitment to encompass **threats to satellites**]{.underline} in space
and coordinated cyberattacks. [NATO can design this effort to include
**adversarial behavior** from China]{.underline}. [The
alliance]{.underline} already [has an array of instruments to deal with
**cyber** and **space** challenges]{.underline} from adversaries. These
can be [extended to encompass China without pronouncing it a
threat]{.underline}.28 This approach allows the US and Europe time to
adjust their cooperation to take into account the fact that China poses
military threats to them both without explicitly using the language of
threat at a time when NATO members do not agree if China should be
defined as a challenge that can trigger Article Five responses.

Since the late 1990s, the [**vulnerability** of **shared space assets**
to cyberattacks has been a concern]{.underline} for both the US and
Europe. For example, [in 1998]{.underline} a US-German
[satellite]{.underline}, used for peering into deep space, [was
**rendered useless** after it turned]{.underline} suddenly [toward the
**sun**]{.underline}, damaging its High Resolution Imager by exposure.
[NASA]{.underline} later [determined]{.underline} that [the accident was
linked to a **cyber-intrusion**]{.underline} at the Goddard Space Flight
Center. Coordinated cyberattacks have emerged as a major threat to both
the US and Europe since the late 1990s. For example, for about eighteen
minutes on April 8, 2010, China Telecom advertised erroneous network
traffic routes that instructed US and other foreign internet traffic to
travel through Chinese servers. Other servers around the world quickly
adopted these paths, routing all traffic, including government and
military traffic, to about 15 percent of the internet's destinations
through servers located in China.29

In the future, [the need to enhance **situational awareness** in space
is likely to lead]{.underline} to further [integration of **space
assets** between the US and its allies]{.underline}.
[Civilian]{.underline} entry [points are likely to provide a **growing
opportunity**]{.underline} for infiltration. The weak state of
cybersecurity in civilian agencies should also be considered.
[Chinese]{.underline} military [doctrine prioritizes weaponry that
targets **vulnerabilities** in the deployment of US and allied
power]{.underline}, such as the use of cyberattacks to disrupt
surveillance assets, intelligence networks, and command-and-control
systems.30 These [threats are **significant**]{.underline},
[since]{.underline} next generation [systems]{.underline}, including
fighter aircraft, destroyers, and special forces, [will not function
without access to **space communication**]{.underline} and space-derived
data.

Although European and [US allies have **indigenous space programs**
outside]{.underline} the **[NATO]{.underline}** framework,
**[cyber]{.underline}** security [and **outer space** would be a useful
field for **joint explorations**]{.underline} of how to divert and
manage attacks and identify an agency [which can coordinate
transatlantic responses to attacks. Allies]{.underline} are [embedded in
a range of information networks]{.underline} which [may be
disrupted]{.underline}, [giving rise to alliance management
concerns]{.underline} emerging from attacks. The [lack of **red lines**
regarding behavior in cyber and outer space between the US and its
allies on one hand,]{.underline} and adversaries such as China on the
other, [adds to the risk of **misperception** and
**escalation**]{.underline}, and hence also highlights the need for
allied coordination to avoid starting a war by mistake. An [improved
NATO dialogue on **safeguards**]{.underline} and alliance consultation
[could]{.underline} also [assist communication with China on arms
control and conflict prevention in]{.underline} cyber and outer
[space]{.underline}, which is not currently taking place.

Looking to the [future, NATO's success in establishing transatlantic
mechanisms for cyber and outer space safeguards]{.underline} and
consultation [will be crucial to allow NATO a key role in taking on the
China challenge]{.underline} in ways that [help restore faith in NATO's
credibility as a provider of collective defense]{.underline} in all
domains. [It]{.underline} [will]{.underline} also [assist NATO in
straddling the **chasm** between member states prioritizing threats from
either **China**, **Russia**, the **Middle East**, or **North
Africa**]{.underline}, since cyber and space threats potentially stem
from all of them, and the effectiveness of cyber and space defense
mechanisms do not necessarily depend on geographical origin.

[**Cyber and space** would allow NATO a **key role** in the **China
challenge**]{.underline} without prioritizing China

### 1AC -- Russia Advantage

#### NATO's [ambiguous threshold]{.underline} for [what constitutes]{.underline} "armed attack" sufficient to [activate Article 5]{.underline} ensures Russian [gray zone probing]{.underline} against allied space assets, risking [cascading]{.underline} escalation

[The **geopolitical context**, **technological trends** and **new
concepts** of **warfare** raise the unpalatable prospect of the
**militarisation of space**]{.underline}. The Outer Space Treaty does
not prohibit that -- it only bans the deployment of nuclear weapons in
it.12 But [while an attack against terrestrial objects on the Alliance's
territory from future **space-based weapons** would constitute a **clear
act** of armed aggression, it remains to be seen if an attack
on]{.underline}, for instance, [satellites owned by an **Allied
government** could eventually **trigger** requests to **activate Article
5**]{.underline} of the Washington Treaty. [Even if the **current
answer** is "no" or "it depends," it will be **hard to avoid further
discussions** given the **growing importance** of the space
domain]{.underline}.13 [After all, the Alliance has already agreed that
devastating **cyberattacks** could prompt an invocation of the
collective defence]{.underline} clause, [and some nations are **very
clear** about their **national responses** to acts of **aggression** in
**outer space**]{.underline}. For instance, [the French]{.underline}
Space Defence Strategy of 2019 [explicitly]{.underline}
[state]{.underline}s that "[in the event of armed aggression in space,
France may avail itself of its right of self defence]{.underline}."14
[It is hard to imagine its Allies]{.underline}, such as the Baltic
States, [standing aside should Paris decide to **request** the
**activation of Article 5** in response to an escalating conflict in
outer space]{.underline}.

[**Aggression** in outer **space** or from the **surface** of the Earth
against space-based assets is not in the realm of technological fiction.
Various countries are **developing** and **deploying** counter-space
capabilities that are able to **destroy**, **degrade**, **deny** or
**compromise** space-based assets. These include **kinetic
means**,]{.underline} such as anti-satellite [(**ASAT**) missiles, as
well as **non-kinetic**]{.underline} capabilities. [Countries ranging
from **China** and **India** to **Russia** and the **US** have tested
and demonstrated their ability to **destroy satellites**]{.underline}
with missiles.15 [Russia is also developing a new system that is able to
deploy into **outer space swarms** of small "killer satellites" loaded
with **explosives**]{.underline} that would be carried into orbit by
missiles launched from a MiG-31BM fighter aircraft.16 [This is a concept
that will enable counter-space operations that are **cheaper**,
**faster**, **larger** in scale and less demanding]{.underline} (e.g. in
targeting accuracy) [than employing ground-launched ASAT
missiles]{.underline}.

The destruction of a satellite, however, inevitably produces thousands
of pieces of debris that scatter across Earth's orbit, potentially
provoking a chain reaction. Such an event -- known as Kessler syndrome
-- could severely threaten space activities and prevent the use of
satellites in specific orbital ranges for decades if not longer. Given
that Russia itself (and China, for that matter) is becoming increasingly
dependent on space infrastructure as a result of its military
modernisation, some analysis suggests that Moscow is interested in
developing a diverse set of kinetic counter-space capabilities primarily
as a deterrent for such space-dependent powers as the US, as well as
being an escalation control instrument that expands the range of options
available to decision-makers.17 In the event of a regional military
crisis in the Baltic area, this would echo the logic of nuclear
signalling in order to deter the US and other Allies from reinforcing
the Baltic States.

At the same time, [the application of]{.underline} more affordable and
easily available [**electronic** and **cyber-warfare** methods could be
just as **disruptive**. Satellites are **vulnerable** to cyber and
electronic attacks, which can have]{.underline} reversable or
[**irreversible effects**. This]{.underline} includes the use of
[radio-frequency energy to **interfere** with or **jam** the
communications of a satellite, the use of **d**irected **e**nergy
**w**eapon**s** to **dazzle** their sensors, and the use of software and
network techniques to influence or compromise computer systems linked to
satellite operations or even to hijack the satellites
themselves.]{.underline}18 [Such non-kinetic counterspace capabilities,
as well as some means of kinetic attack]{.underline} (e.g. using
hijacked satellites to damage or destroy other satellites, or conducting
Rendezvous Proximity Operations to approach and damage an opponent's
satellites), [will become part of the repertoire in the so called
"**grey zone**" conflicts that **Russia** and **China** excel at and so
far tend prefer to direct military confrontation.]{.underline} For the
decision-makers in the Baltic States, [this raises the spectre of space
services]{.underline} (such as imagery, communications, or global
positioning and navigation) [provided by Allies or commercial partners
becoming restricted or unavailable at some critical points during a
**security crisis** manufactured by Russia]{.underline}.

[If a **mechanical failure**]{.underline} -- [due to a **natural
incident** or **hostile action**]{.underline} -- [leading to a denial of
service or complete loss of space assets occurs during a period of
**heightened geopolitical tensions**, the **possibility of escalation**
and **broader conflict** could arise. At this point]{.underline}, in the
words of Joan Johnson-Freese, ["the chances of maintaining a **space
war** at a **limited level** appear similar to those of fighting a
limited **nuclear war**: **not good**."]{.underline}19 [Scenarios like
this may require that NATO not only **coordinate** the development of
new capabilities and enhance its space threat awareness, but also
incorporate diplomacy into the implementation of its space policy in
order to advance **international norms** of **responsible behaviour**
with regard to space-based systems and assets, build **transparency**
and **trust**, and **preserve** the overall **strategic stability**,
which could be threatened by escalating conflict in outer
space]{.underline}.20 For the Baltic States -- which have become
sceptical towards arms control, CSBM and other frameworks and
initiatives involving Russia -- this might become a difficult
proposition, prompting them to define some clear "red lines", the
crossing of which might weaken the Alliance's deterrence and defence
posture. However, doing so would entail understanding strategic issues
related to outer space and defining their own perspective.

The Baltic perspective and challenges

[The recognition of outer space as an operational domain has various
implications for the Alliance and its individual members]{.underline},
even if NATO's ambition is not (yet) to become an actor in it. As
Kęstutis Paulauskas points out, [the "implementation of space as an
**operational domain** will allow NATO's military commanders to properly
and fully take into account **space requirements** in **training** and
**exercises** as well as defence and operational
planning."]{.underline}21 [The Alliance will now be busy **defining**
and **refining** its requirements for space capabilities and then,
through the defence planning process, will seek to ensure that the
capabilities of all NATO nations are catalogued and
coordinated]{.underline}, as well as that national plans take into
account NATO's needs [and do not leave any significant gaps when put
together]{.underline}. The Alliance's planning of multidomain operations
(MDOs), joint doctrine development, standardisation processes, and
training and exercises will include space considerations as a composite
part.22 By establishing a Space Centre, the Alliance has already started
to make some visible structural adjustments, allowing it develop space
domain awareness, share data, and coordinate activities within NATO's
overall command structure -- and there is much more less-visible but
equally important work being done across the Alliance in order to
implement its overarching space policy.23

Where does this put the Baltic States? The space domain has always been
a blind spot in the defence planning and capability development
processes in the three capitals. Just a few years back, mentioning the
need to consider the implications of developments in outer space drew
blank faces at best and outright ridicule at worst. Interest in support
from space-based assets was confined to small, specialised military
communities of practice such as ISR, communications, naval and special
forces, or air surveillance. It seldom, if at all, entered the
considerations of the high command or defence planners, as the Baltic
States retained their steady focus on developing land forces as their
top priority -- even though land operations rely, to a considerable
extent, on the availability of various space-based services. Space
ignorance also stands in stark contrast to all the attention paid to the
cyber domain, which was declared a new operational domain by NATO in
2016, leading to such steps as the establishment of a dedicated Cyber
Command in the Estonian Defence Forces (EDF).24

NATO's London decision is now tentatively putting space on the mental
map of the defence leadership in the Baltic States. In a recent media
interview, for instance, the Commander of the EDF Major General Martin
Herem said that this was potentially a new area for trilateral Baltic
military cooperation, and he even suggested that the Baltic States draw
upon the civilian sector's work in order to develop their own
space-based capability (in the form of nanosatellites).25 Although this
may sound like a somewhat poorly thought-through idea -- not least
because trilateral Baltic military cooperation has been underperforming
in many other areas that are less challenging or complex than venturing
into outer space -- it still marks a welcome turn of sentiment regarding
opportunities related to space as an operational domain.26 At the same
time, it is necessary to understand that any national or regional
ambition that is linked to a broader NATO framework would take a long
time to acquire shape, to develop all the ingredients necessary for its
success, and then to reach maturity as an integral part of national
defence.

In this process, however, there are some issues and aspects that could
already be addressed by Baltic defence policymakers and military
planners in the short- and medium-term:

- [At the **policy level**, there is a need for]{.underline} national
  and regional (e.g. within the format of the Baltic Ministerial
  Committee) [discussions on **what** would constitute **acts of
  aggression** in outer space that would warrant the **invocation of
  Article 5** and where the "grey zones" of conflict lie with regard to
  **adversarial** kinetic and nonkinetic action against the space assets
  and infrastructure of the Allies. This is a necessary mental exercise
  that would help]{.underline} the Baltics [appreciate how **various
  scenarios** may **unfold** and when a collective **diplomatic** and
  **military action** might be called upon (or when scenarios would
  **just warrant security consultations** under **Article
  4**).]{.underline}

#### Nuclear escalation is [certain]{.underline} -- past NATO exercises prove this is the [most likely scenario]{.underline} for space war

David **Wilson 20**, Writer for Broadview; Broadview, October 19,
\"Could outer space be the world's next battleground?\"
https://broadview.org/weaponization-of-space/

West directed the research team for the 2019 edition of the Space
Security Index, an exhaustive annual report on developments related to
safety, security and sustainability in outer space. According to the
report, in 2018 [the **U**nited **S**tates, **Russia** and China had a
combined total of 263 dedicated **military satellites** in orbit, in
addition to]{.underline} operating [several dozen GPS]{.underline} (or
equivalent) [satellite systems. Eighteen other countries]{.underline},
including Canada, [operate military satellites]{.underline} of their own
[or piggyback military functions on top of civilian uses]{.underline}.

"There's always been this fear of war in space, as distinct from war on
Earth," says Brian Weeden, who contributed a chapter to the report.
"It's not \[distinct\]. It's the integration of space into terrestrial
warfare, not something that happens separately."

[Within that integration lurks the **trigger** for a kind of **conflict
never seen before**]{.underline} --- [where **events on Earth** spark a
**clash in space**, or where events in space **incite hostilities** on
Earth, with **unpredictable consequences** up to and including a
**nuclear exchange**. "The most likely way]{.underline} to initiate a
conflict [would be one country disabling a satellite or spacecraft of
another country]{.underline}," says Dawson. ["Depending on the result,
the **conflict could escalate** into **further destruction** in orbit or
the beginning]{.underline} of more [**traditional warfare** back on
Earth]{.underline}."

Using projectiles to smash enemy satellites would create vast fields of
space debris that could imperil other satellites, including those
belonging to the attacker, and set in motion an escalating chain of
collisions that could ultimately render orbit unusable. For that reason,
[cyberwarfare]{.underline} --- [the electronic jamming, hijacking or
"spoofing" of enemy **satellites** so they send **misleading signals**
back to Earth]{.underline} --- [is the **most likely** form that a
conflict in space would take]{.underline}. (In fact, the Space Security
Index reports that cyber[attacks]{.underline} [have already taken
place]{.underline} in the Middle East and Ukraine, and
**[during]{.underline}** 2018 **[NATO exercises]{.underline}** in
Finland and Norway.) [The **arsenals** of the major space
powers]{.underline} are also believed to [include **lasers** and other
**d**irected-**e**nergy **w**eapons, as well as **stalker
satellites**]{.underline} that can manoeuvre alongside an enemy
spacecraft to spy on it or disable it.

#### A U.S.-Russian space war [spills over]{.underline} to [ground-based]{.underline} nuclear miscalculation due to attacks on [early-warning]{.underline}

James **Acton and** Ankit **Panda 20**, Co-Director of the Nuclear
Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace;
Stanton Senior Fellow with the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace; Defense News, December 2, "Why the
Pentagon must think harder about inadvertent escalation,"
<https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2020/12/02/why-the-pentagon-must-think-harder-about-inadvertent-escalation/>

[In a **paradox** worthy of the **nuclear age**, the **conventional
capabilities** that have enabled the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [to reduce its reliance on nuclear weapons have
also increased the **risk of misperception** that could **spark a
nuclear war**]{.underline}.

The United States now bases its war plans around [using]{.underline} its
[exquisite **conventional forces** to **sever the connections** between
an **adversary's leadership** and its **military forces**]{.underline}.
But in an escalating conflict on the Korean Peninsula, such operations
could look to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un like an attempt at regime
change --- even if the United States did not seek to depose him --- and
thus induce him to gamble on nuclear use to try to terrify the United
States into backing off.

[In a war against Russia]{.underline}, meanwhile, [the **United
States**]{.underline} [might try to **protect its satellites** by
attacking the radars that **Russia** uses to track space
assets]{.underline}. [Such radars, however, are also used to detect
attacks on **Russia's nuclear forces**]{.underline}, thus [giving Moscow
the ability to launch those forces before they are
destroyed]{.underline}. As a result, [Moscow might wrongly conclude that
attacks on those **early-warning radars** were the **opening salvo** of
a U.S. campaign to destroy its **nuclear forces**]{.underline}. Again,
[a **nuclear war** could be the **result**]{.underline}.

Concerns about so-called inadvertent escalation have now reached
Congress. As part of the fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Act,
Congress requested that the undersecretary of defense for policy prepare
a report "detailing the Department's efforts to develop and implement
guidance to ensure that the risks of inadvertent escalation to a nuclear
war are considered within the decision-making processes with regard to
relevant Department activities."

The Pentagon's newly released response is titled "Managing Risks of
Nuclear Escalation." Note the (presumably deliberate) absence of the
word "inadvertent" in the title. This document is deeply concerned with
one particular escalation risk: that the United States' nuclear-armed
adversaries --- Russia, China and North Korea --- may underestimate U.S.
resolve or capabilities. This danger is real, but it has a flipside:
that [an adversary may assess **U.S. war aims** to be more ambitious or
expansive than they actually are]{.underline}.

#### ASAT attacks cause global nuclear war and collapse terrestrial deterrence\-\--turns every conflict scenario 

Laura **Grego 18**, senior scientist in the Global Security Program at
the Union of Concerned Scientists, 3/19/18, "Space and Crisis
Stability,"
https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/files/7804-grego-space-and-crisis-stabilitypdf

For the foreseeable future, [military tensions between the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [China, and Russia are
likely to remain high]{.underline}, as are those between China and
India. Even absent intentional confrontation, regional problems, such as
those in the Baltics and East and South Asia, have the potential to draw
these actors into conflict. Thus, [it is imperative to pay attention
to]{.underline} any [pathways that could lead an actor]{.underline}
considering **[crossing the nuclear threshold]{.underline}**, or
approaching it very closely.

[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
Russia]{.underline} continue to [retain large nuclear arsenals on high
alert]{.underline}1 . Each are developing new strategic weapons,
including hypersonic conventional prompt global strike systems with a
suggestion mission of holding ground-based anti-satellite weapons at
risk.2 [Russia has declared]{.underline} the [existence of novel nuclear
delivery systems]{.underline} as a response to US missile defense
systems,3 weapons which complicate the management of crises. [China
is]{.underline} reportedly [considering increasing the size, capacity
and alert status of its nuclear weapons]{.underline} delivery systems4
and is also developing new kinds of strategic weapons. [China
is]{.underline} also [developing **hypersonic weapons**]{.underline},5
and the ingredients for an arms race around these technologies is in
place. India continues to increase the sophistication of its strategic
posture. And India, China, Russia and the United States have or are
pursuing missile defense technologies that are important both in the
nuclear realm but in space issues, since missile defenses present
demonstrated or inherent antisatellite capabilities.

Thus [it is critical to ensure]{.underline} that [in times of tension,
no actor **escalates the crisis inadvertently**]{.underline} or against
their better judgment, and that misperception does not play an important
role in the initiation or progress of the crisis. And that hostilities,
if initiated, resolve as quickly as possible.

Thomas Schelling's encapsulated an aspect of this idea in his landmark
work this way:

This is the problem of surprise attack. If surprise carries an
advantage, it is worth while \[sic\] to avert it by striking first. Fear
that the other may be about to strike in the mistaken belief that we are
about to strike gives us a motive for striking, and so justifies the
other's motive. But if the gains from even successful surprise are less
desired than no war at all, there is no ―fundamental‖ basis for an
attack by each side. Nevertheless, it look as though a modest temptation
on each side to sneak in the first place --- a temptation too small by
itself to motivate an attack --- might become compounded through a
process of interacting expectations, with additional motive for attack
being produced by successive cycles of ―He thinks we think he thinks we
think ... he think we think he'll attack; so he thinks we will; so he
will; so we must.6

This suggests that it is important to make the advantage of surprise
attack negligible and the disadvantages as great as possible, to make
sure that all actors understand this, and to make sure that actors have
as clear an understanding of each other's motivations as possible to
avoid miscalculation.

In the last twenty years, [**space assets** have become important not
only for strategic missions but also increasingly underpin conventional
military force]{.underline} for modern militaries, and especially those
with expeditionary forces, such as the United States. [They are
essential not only for militaries, but are a critical provider of
essential civilian, commercial, and scientific services]{.underline}.
Not only do satellites perform many more missions than they have in the
past, [there are many more spacefaring nations. While most satellites
belong to the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [Russia,
and China, more than sixty countries own satellites]{.underline} or a
large stake in one.7

At the same time, the [**tech**nologies that are useful for **holding
satellites at risk** have grown significantly]{.underline} in
sophistication and capacity even in the last decade, and have become
more widely available. This is particularly problematic because [attacks
on satellites can **create or escalate terrestrial crises** in
potentially **difficult to predict ways**]{.underline}. The world is
drifting towards a space regime that faces an ever more prevalent and
more sophisticated anti-satellite technology and greater numbers and
types of targets in space, with very little mutual understanding about
how actions in space are perceived.

#### Cyber-weapons are the only usable ASATs\-\--U.S. dependence on satellite infrastructure incentivizes attacks that risk nuclear war

[A future war in space includes the possibility of]{.underline} one or
more anti-satellite ([ASAT) attacks which could destroy]{.underline} one
or several [important satellites and **quickly escalate to a nuclear
conflict**]{.underline}. In 2014, the Obama administration initiated the
need to develop new ASAT defense strategies and technology to counter
China after its second ASAT test the year before (Kulacki, 2016).
[Attacking any U.S.]{.underline} intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance ([ISR) satellite]{.underline}, Global Positioning System
([GPS) or communication satellites using missiles such as long-range
missiles or Co-Orbital ASATS is **expensive, time-consuming, and is hard
to keep a secret**]{.underline} (Hitchens, 2019d & Wright, 2012). [It
could be used to deter initial U.S. involvement in conflict but would
have devastating impacts on its loss]{.underline} (Please see Appendix A
& B for more information).

[It is no secret]{.underline} that [the U.S.'s major vulnerabilities lie
with modernizing the National Airspace System]{.underline}
(**[NAS]{.underline}**) [and using only one source for timing,
navigation, and communication (aka GPS]{.underline}) whereas Russia,
Europe, China, and others utilize additional forms of satellite
navigation systems (Livingstone & Lewis, 2016). Therefore, [**only the
U.S. would suffer losses** with the disruption or destruction of the GPS
constellation. To achieve enough damage]{.underline} to the GPS
constellation and other space-based assets [would require several
**sat**ellite**s** to be disabled]{.underline} to successfully disrupt
the network and disable the U.S. [This would have to be done in quick
succession before the U.S. could retaliate which is]{.underline} also
[hard to do and the adversary would have to covertly launch its missiles
from several locations or maneuver ASATs currently in orbit]{.underline}
to attack its targets. [On the other hand]{.underline}, hostile [**cyber
operations are a much bigger threat** to the operation of satellites
such as GPS]{.underline} (Findler, 2019). [As]{.underline} both
[cyberspace and space assets increasingly rely on each other it is
imperative to implement flexible, proactive cybersecurity
measures]{.underline} as new threat actors, companies, and technologies
are always expanding and evolving space activities (Findler, 2019).

[Space and cyberspace]{.underline} share several similarities. Both,
along with international waters and airspace, [are a global common\[s\]
for]{.underline} the [international competition which]{.underline} in
turn **[determines the global distribution of power]{.underline}**
(Heftye, 2017). Both have applications that affect the everyday lives of
many people and economies worldwide (Asbek, 2014). Although cyberspace
is a man-made domain, it produces virtual results used for military
operations and, along with space, provides adversaries a viable platform
for exploitation.

In the last decade the [integration of internet-based infrastructure
into space systems]{.underline}, such as communications satellites [has
become an integral part of how satellites operate]{.underline} (Mather,
2018). [Along with ASATS]{.underline}, other [technologies are being
developed to "deny, degrade, deceive, disrupt, or destroy space
assets]{.underline}," thus [rendering space infrastructure
useless]{.underline} (DOD & DNI, 2011). This includes lasers capable of
blinding and knocking down space assets, jamming signals from space, and
cyberattacks on satellites which are often considered electronic attacks
that are reversable in comparison to orbital threats or nuclear
explosions which are irreversible as shown in Figure 1 (Harrison,
Johnson, & Roberts, 2019).

[The major difference between physical weapons and cyber-attacks is the
cost and time]{.underline} associated with an attack. [Space assets are
vulnerable to cyber threats and the growing dependence on them for
commercial and military purposes]{.underline} alike [could pose a
**serious national security threat**]{.underline}. There was a time that
critical infrastructure was supported by its proprietary technologies of
which many have been replaced with internet-based technologies. As a
result, nearly anything can be attacked through the internet, especially
the [interconnected space-assets]{.underline} which [will inevitably be
a primary target in the case of significant conflict]{.underline}.

#### Attacks on space assets and orbital weapons trigger rapid escalation to great power nuclear war

of Defense Office of Net Assessment; and Peter L. Hays, retired Air
Force Lt Col who works as a defense contractor in the Pentagon

SPACE WEAPONS,"

In addition, some argue that [space weapons present broader geopolitical
risks due to their]{.underline} potential [effects on deterrence and
strategic stability. Space capabilities have a close relationship to
**nuclear stability and**]{.underline} the potential for [**escalation
between great powers**. Space weapons could]{.underline} therefore
[alter how decisionmakers calculate nuclear deterrence]{.underline}.
Many of the visions of [space-to-Earth weapons]{.underline} imagine them
having incredible speed and accuracy tied to the ability to target any
point on Earth with minimal or even no warning. At enough scale and with
sufficient destructive effects, such attributes [would threaten a
first-strike capability; i.e., the ability to wipe out a target
country's nuclear deterrent before it has a chance to launch a
retaliatory strike. If so, **nuclear deterrence may fail**, a
consideration that may **outweigh all others**]{.underline}. Similarly,
some have comparable concerns about space-based ballistic missile
defenses nullifying a country's nuclear deterrent and providing a
nuclear first-strike incentive for the country that possesses such
capability.

[Earth-to-space weapons]{.underline} create concerns because [targeting
early warning satellites]{.underline}, strategic
[surveillance]{.underline} satellites, [and nuclear command and
control]{.underline} communication [**sat**ellite**s**
could]{.underline} also [be perceived as the immediate prelude to a
nuclear first strike]{.underline} by an adversary, **[triggering a
response on the nuclear escalation ladder]{.underline}**. Even if [space
weapons]{.underline} do not fatally undermine nuclear deterrence, they
still [offer another path to **rapid nuclear escalation**]{.underline}.

Space weapons might upset strategic stability in other ways as well.
[Space is]{.underline} considered an **[offensive
dominant]{.underline}** arena, meaning [it is materially easier and less
costly to attack a satellite]{.underline}---including space-based
weapons---[than to defend a satellite]{.underline}. Earth-to-space and
space-to-space weapons provide an offensive capability for attacking
targets in space. Political scientists contend that war is more likely
when the offensive is dominant---especially if it is difficult to
distinguish between offensive and defensive weapons---and argue that
there are strong incentives for striking first should a conflict appear
inevitable.13 Surprise attack is perceived as leading to large rewards.
[Space weapons provide a first-mover advantage for striking in space,
but their speed could create crisis instability since
decisionmakers]{.underline}---on all sides---[will have very little
time]{.underline} (perhaps only a handful of minutes) [to decide what to
do in the face of a sudden attack in space, creating a high risk of
rapid escalation due to misunderstanding, miscommunication, and
miscalculation]{.underline}.

Finally, the use of destructive, non-reversible kinetic Earth-to-space
or space-to-space weapons would likely leave a persistent cloud of
debris and pose a long-term (potentially decades or much longer) hazard
to all satellites, including commercial and scientific satellites as
well as satellites from non-adversary nations. Using weapons with
non-kinetic, non-permanent affects would mitigate this risk.

The Previous Debate: Changes in Context, Assumptions, and Alternatives

A vigorous public discussion covering many of the factors discussed
above flared during the last period in which the U.S. seriously
considered the merits of space-based weapons, peaking around 2002 and
waning a few years later.14 But a lot has changed since then.

The earlier debate centered around two key alternatives: the first was
whether the United States should deploy space-based weapons first---well
before China or Russia would be capable of doing so effectively---in
order to take a significant strategic leap ahead or, second, whether the
United States should practice restraint in order to preserve strategic
stability and not provoke China or Russia to react in kind. Those core
alternatives are no longer operative. Since that era, [China
has]{.underline} deployed operational [ground-based]{.underline},
direct-ascent, kinetic-kill ASATs [and]{.underline} demonstrated
[co-orbital ASAT]{.underline} capabilities.15 [Russia has
also]{.underline} tested ground-based, direct-ascent kinetic ASATs and
appears to have tested in-orbit anti-satellite weaponry as well. The
United States no longer gets to choose whether to leap ahead or to seek
to inspire restraint among U.S. competitors. Indeed, [today both China
and Russia have the capability to station weapons in space]{.underline}
and the June 2020 Defense Space Strategy states bluntly that China and
Russia have already weaponized space.16 While a future administration
could revise U.S. strategy in space or attempt to secure new
international agreements restricting space weapons, the U.S. has rung a
bell that cannot be unrung by declaring space as a warfighting domain
and by revealing some of what is known about potential adversaries'
activities there. [There will be implications on **behavior by allies,
adversaries, and third parties**, as well as within the U.S.
government]{.underline}.

#### The US would retaliate to an attack on a satellite -- NC3 failure is sufficient for a nuclear response

Michael T. **Klare 19**, professor emeritus of peace and world security
studies at Hampshire College and senior visiting fellow at the Arms
Control Association, November 2019, "Cyber Battles, Nuclear Outcomes?
Dangerous New Pathways to Escalation,"
<https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-11/features/cyber-battles-nuclear-outcomes-dangerous-new-pathways-escalation>

In January 2018, details of [the Trump]{.underline} administration's
Nuclear Posture Review ([NPR]{.underline}) were posted online by the
Huffington Post, provoking widespread alarm over what were viewed as
dangerous shifts in U.S. nuclear policy. Arousing most concern was a
call for the acquisition of several types of low-yield nuclear weapons,
a proposal viewed by many analysts as increasing the risk of nuclear
weapons use.

Another initiative incorporated in the strategy document also aroused
concern: the [claim that an enemy cyberattack on U.S]{.underline}.
nuclear command, control, and communications ([NC3) facilities would
constitute a "non-nuclear strategic attack" of sufficient magnitude to
**justify the use of nuclear weapons in response**]{.underline}.

[Under the Obama]{.underline} administration's [NPR]{.underline} report,
released in April 2010, the [circumstances under which the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [would consider
responding to non-nuclear attacks with nuclear weapons were said to be
few]{.underline}. "The United States will continue to...reduce the role
of nuclear weapons in deterring non-nuclear attacks," the report stated.
Although little was said about what sort of non-nuclear attacks might be
deemed severe enough to justify a nuclear response, cyberstrikes were
not identified as one of these. [The 2018 NPR]{.underline} report,
however, [portrayed a very **different environment**]{.underline}, one
[in which nuclear combat is seen as increasingly possible and in which
non-nuclear strategic threats, **especially in cyberspace**, were viewed
as sufficiently menacing to justify a nuclear response]{.underline}.
Speaking of Russian technological progress, for example, the draft
version of the Trump administration's NPR report stated, "To...correct
any Russian misperceptions of advantage, the president will have an
expanding range of limited and graduated \[nuclear\] options to credibly
deter Russian nuclear or non-nuclear strategic attacks, which could now
include attacks against U.S. NC3, in space and cyberspace."1

The [notion that a cyberattack on U.S. digital systems,
even]{.underline} those [used for nuclear weapons, would constitute
sufficient grounds to launch a nuclear attack was]{.underline} seen by
many observers as [**a dangerous shift in policy**, greatly increasing
the risk of accidental or inadvertent nuclear escalation in a
crisis]{.underline}. "The entire [broadening]{.underline} of [the
landscape for nuclear deterrence is a very fundamental step in the wrong
direction]{.underline}," said former Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz.
"I think the idea of nuclear deterrence of cyberattacks, broadly,
certainly does not make any sense."2

Despite such admonitions, [the Pentagon **reaffirmed** its views on the
links between cyberattacks and nuclear weapons use when it released the
final]{.underline} version of the [NPR]{.underline} report in February
2018. The official text now states that the president must possess a
spectrum of nuclear weapons with which to respond to "attacks against
U.S. NC3," and it identifies cyberattacks as one form of non-nuclear
strategic warfare that could trigger a nuclear response.

That cyberwarfare had risen to this level of threat, the 2018 NPR report
indicated, was a product of the enhanced cybercapabilities of potential
adversaries and of the creeping obsolescence of many existing U.S. NC3
systems. To overcome these vulnerabilities, it called for substantial
investment in an upgraded NC3 infrastructure. [Not
mentioned]{.underline}, however, [were extensive U.S. efforts to employ
cybertools to infiltrate and]{.underline} potentially [**incapacitate
the NC3 systems of likely adversaries**, including Russia,
China]{.underline}, and North Korea.

For the past several years, [the **U.S. Department of Defense** has been
exploring how it could employ its own very robust cyberattack
capabilities to compromise or destroy enemy missiles]{.underline} from
such states as North Korea before they can be fired, a strategy
sometimes called "left of launch."3 [Russia and China can
assume]{.underline}, on this basis, that [their]{.underline} own [launch
facilities are being probed for such vulnerabilities]{.underline},
presumably **[leading them to adopt escalatory policies]{.underline}**
such as those espoused in the 2018 NPR report. Wherever one looks,
therefore, the links between cyberwar and nuclear war are growing.

The Nuclear-Cyber Connection

[These links exist because the NC3 systems of the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and other
nuclear-armed states are heavily dependent on computers and other
digital processors for virtually every aspect of their operation
and]{.underline} because [those systems are **highly vulnerable to
cyberattack**. Every nuclear force is composed]{.underline}, most
basically, [of weapons, early-warning radars, launch facilities, and the
top officials]{.underline}, usually presidents or prime ministers,
[empowered to initiate a nuclear exchange. **Connecting them
all**]{.underline}, however, [is **a**n extended network of
**communications and data-processing systems**, all reliant on
cyberspace. Warning systems, **ground- and space-based**, must
constantly watch for]{.underline} and analyze [possible]{.underline}
enemy missile [launches. Data on actual threats must rapidly be
communicated to decision-makers]{.underline}, who must then weigh
possible responses and communicate chosen outcomes to launch facilities,
which in turn must provide attack vectors to delivery systems. [All of
this involves operations in cyberspace]{.underline}, and it is in this
domain that great power rivals seek vulnerabilities to exploit in a
constant struggle for advantage.

The use of cyberspace to gain an advantage over adversaries takes many
forms and is not always aimed at nuclear systems. China has been accused
of engaging in widespread cyberespionage to steal technical secrets from
U.S. firms for economic and military advantages. Russia has been
accused, most extensively in the Robert Mueller report, of exploiting
cyberspace to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Nonstate
actors, including terrorist groups such as al Qaeda and the Islamic
State group, have used the internet for recruiting combatants and
spreading fear. Criminal groups, including some thought to be allied
with state actors, such as North Korea, have used cyberspace to extort
money from banks, municipalities, and individuals.4 Attacks such as
these occupy most of the time and attention of civilian and military
cybersecurity organizations that attempt to thwart such attacks. Yet
[for]{.underline} those who worry about strategic stability and the
**[risks of nuclear escalation]{.underline}**, it is [the threat of
cyberattacks on NC3 systems]{.underline} that [provokes the greatest
concern]{.underline}.

This concern stems from the fact that, despite the immense effort
devoted to protecting NC3 systems from cyberattack, [no enterprise that
relies so extensively on computers and cyberspace can be made 100
percent invulnerable to attack]{.underline}. This is so because such
systems employ many devices and operating systems of various origins and
vintages, most incorporating numerous software updates and "patches"
over time, offering multiple vectors for attack. Electronic components
can also be modified by hostile actors during production, transit, or
insertion; and the whole system itself is dependent to a considerable
degree on the electrical grid, which itself is vulnerable to cyberattack
and is far less protected. Experienced "cyberwarriors" of every major
power have been working for years to probe for weaknesses in these
systems and in many cases have devised cyberweapons, typically,
malicious software (malware) and computer viruses, to exploit those
weaknesses for military advantage.5

Although activity in cyberspace is much more difficult to detect and
track than conventional military operations, enough information has
become public to indicate that [the major nuclear powers, notably China,
Russia, and the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, along
with such secondary powers as Iran and North Korea, [have established
extensive cyberwarfare capabilities and engage in offensive
cyberoperations on a regular basis]{.underline}, often [aimed at
critical military infrastructure]{.underline}. "Cyberspace is a
contested environment where we are in constant contact with
adversaries," General Paul M. Nakasone, commander of the U.S. Cyber
Command (Cybercom), told the Senate Armed Services Committee in February
2019. "We see near-peer competitors \[China and Russia\] conducting
sustained campaigns below the level of armed conflict to erode American
strength and gain strategic advantage."

Although eager to speak of adversary threats to U.S. interests, Nakasone
was noticeably but not surprisingly reluctant to say much about U.S.
offensive operations in cyberspace. He acknowledged, however, that
Cybercom took such action to disrupt possible Russian interference in
the 2018 midterm elections. "We created a persistent presence in
cyberspace to monitor adversary actions and crafted tools and tactics to
frustrate their efforts," he testified in February. According to press
accounts, this included a cyberattack aimed at paralyzing the Internet
Research Agency, a "troll farm" in St. Petersburg said to have been
deeply involved in generating disruptive propaganda during the 2016
presidential elections.6

Other press investigations have disclosed two other offensive operations
undertaken by the United States. One called "Olympic Games" was intended
to disrupt Iran's drive to increase its uranium-enrichment capacity by
sabotaging the centrifuges used in the process by infecting them with
the so-called Stuxnet virus. Another left of launch effort was intended
to cause malfunctions in North Korean missile tests.7 Although not aimed
at either of the U.S. principal nuclear adversaries, those two attacks
demonstrated a willingness and capacity to conduct cyberattacks on the
nuclear infrastructure of other states.

Efforts by strategic rivals of the United States to infiltrate and
eventually degrade U.S. nuclear infrastructure are far less documented
but thought to be no less prevalent. Russia, for example, is believed to
have planted malware in the U.S. electrical utility grid, possibly with
the intent of cutting off the flow of electricity to critical NC3
facilities in the event of a major crisis.8 Indeed, every major power,
including the United States, is believed to have crafted cyberweapons
aimed at critical NC3 components and to have implanted malware in enemy
systems for potential use in some future confrontation.

Pathways to Escalation

Knowing that the NC3 systems of the major powers are constantly being
probed for weaknesses and probably infested with malware designed to be
activated in a crisis, what does this say about the risks of escalation
from a nonkinetic battle, that is, one fought without traditional
weaponry, to a kinetic one, at first using conventional weapons and
then, potentially, nuclear ones? None of this can be predicted in
advance, but those analysts who have studied the subject worry about the
emergence of dangerous new pathways for escalation. Indeed, several such
scenarios have been identified.9

[The]{.underline} first and possibly [most dangerous path to escalation
would arise from the early use of cyberweapons in a great power crisis
to paralyze the vital command, control, and communications capabilities
of an adversary, many of which serve nuclear and conventional forces. In
the "fog of war]{.underline}" that would naturally ensue from such an
encounter, [the recipient]{.underline} of such an attack [might fear
more punishing follow-up kinetic attacks]{.underline}, possibly
[including the use of nuclear weapons, and]{.underline}, fearing the
loss of its own arsenal, [**launch its weapons immediately**. This might
occur]{.underline}, for example, [in a confrontation between NATO and
Russian forces]{.underline} in east and central Europe [or]{.underline}
between [U.S. and Chinese]{.underline} forces in the Asia-Pacific
region.

Speaking of a possible confrontation in Europe, for example, James N.
Miller Jr. and Richard Fontaine wrote that "[both sides would have
**overwhelming incentives to go early** with offensive cyber and
counter-space capabilities to negate the other side's military
capabilities]{.underline} or advantages." If these early attacks
succeeded, "it could result in huge military and coercive advantage for
the attacker." This might induce the recipient of such attacks to back
down, affording its rival a major victory at very low cost.
Alternatively, however, [the recipient might view the attacks on its
critical command, control, and communications infrastructure as the
prelude to a full-scale attack aimed at neutralizing its nuclear
capabilities and choose to strike first]{.underline}. "It is worth
considering," Miller and Fontaine concluded, "how **[even a very limited
attack or incident could set both sides on a slippery slope to rapid
escalation]{.underline}**."10

What makes the insertion of latent [malware in an adversary's NC3
systems]{.underline} so dangerous is that it [**may not even need to be
activated** to increase the risk of nuclear escalation. If a
nuclear]{.underline}-armed [state comes to believe]{.underline} that
[its critical systems are infested with enemy malware, its leaders
**might not trust the information provided by its early-warning
systems** in a crisis and might misconstrue the nature of an enemy
attack]{.underline}, leading them to overreact and possibly launch their
nuclear weapons out of fear they are at risk of a preemptive strike.

"The [uncertainty caused by the unique character of a cyber threat could
**jeopardize the credibility of the nuclear deterrent** and undermine
strategic stability in ways that advances in nuclear and conventional
weapons do not]{.underline}," Page O. Stoutland and Samantha
Pitts-Kiefer wrote in 2018 paper for the Nuclear Threat Initiative.
"\[T\]he introduction of a flaw or malicious code into nuclear weapons
through the supply chain that compromises the effectiveness of those
weapons could lead to a lack of confidence in the nuclear deterrent,"
undermining strategic stability.11 [Without confidence in the
reliability of its nuclear weapons infrastructure, a nuclear-armed state
may misinterpret confusing signals from its early-warning systems
and]{.underline}, fearing the worst, [launch its own nuclear weapons
rather than lose them to an enemy's first strike]{.underline}. This
makes the scenario proffered in the 2018 NPR report, of a nuclear
response to an enemy cyberattack, that much more alarming.

Yet [another pathway to escalation could arise from a **cascading series
of cyberstrikes and counterstrikes** against vital national
infrastructure rather than on military targets. All major
powers]{.underline}, along with Iran and North Korea, [have]{.underline}
developed and deployed [cyberweapons designed to disrupt and
destroy]{.underline} major elements of an adversary's key economic
systems, such as [**power grids**, **financial systems**, and
**transportation networks**]{.underline}. As noted, Russia has
infiltrated the U.S. electrical grid, and it is widely believed that the
United States has done the same in Russia.12 The Pentagon has also
devised a plan known as "Nitro Zeus," intended to immobilize the entire
Iranian economy and so force it to capitulate to U.S. demands or, if
that approach failed, to pave the way for a crippling air and missile
attack.13

The danger here is that [economic attacks of this sort, if undertaken
during a period of tension and crisis, could lead to an escalating
series of tit-for-tat attacks against ever more vital elements of an
adversary's critical infrastructure]{.underline}, producing widespread
chaos and harm and eventually [leading one side to initiate kinetic
attacks on critical military targets, risking the **slippery slope to
nuclear conflict**]{.underline}. For example, [a Russian cyberattack on
the U.S. power grid could trigger U.S. attacks on Russian energy and
financial systems, causing widespread disorder]{.underline} in both
countries and [generating an impulse for even more devastating
attacks]{.underline}. At some point, [such attacks "could lead to
**major conflict and possibly nuclear war**]{.underline}."14

These are by no means the only pathways to escalation resulting from the
offensive use of cyberweapons. Others include efforts by third parties,
such as proxy states or terrorist organizations, to provoke a global
nuclear crisis by causing early-warning systems to generate false
readings ("spoofing") of missile launches. Yet, they do provide a clear
indication of the severity of the threat. As states' reliance on
cyberspace grows and cyberweapons become more powerful, the dangers of
unintended or accidental escalation can only grow more severe.

'Defending Forward'

Under these circumstances, [one would think]{.underline} the [major
powers would seek to place restrictions on]{.underline} the use of
[offensive cyberweapons]{.underline}, especially those aimed at critical
NC3 systems. [This approach]{.underline}, however, **[is not being
pursued by the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and the
other major powers.

Under the Obama administration, the Department of Defense was empowered
to conduct offensive cyberstrikes on foreign states and entities in
response to like attacks on the United States, but any such moves
required high-level review by the White House and were rarely approved.
This approach was embedded in Presidential Policy Directive 20 (PPD-20),
adopted in October 2012, which states that any cyberaction that might
result in "significant consequences," such as loss of life or adverse
foreign policy impacts, required "specific presidential approval."

Officials in the Trump administration found this requirement unduly
restrictive and so persuaded the president to rescind PPD-20 and replace
it with a more permissive measure. The resulting document, National
Security Presidential Memorandum 13 (NSPM-13), was approved in September
2018 but has not been made public. From what is known of NSPM-13,
[senior military commanders]{.underline}, such as Nakasone, [enjoy
preapproval to undertake offensive strikes against foreign entities
under certain specified conditions without further White House
clearance]{.underline}. In accordance with the new policy, military
planners can prepare for offensive cyberattacks by seeking
vulnerabilities in adversarial computer networks and by implanting
malware in these weak spots for potential utilization if a retaliatory
strike is initiated.15

As translated into formal military doctrine, [this approach is described
as "defending forward," or seeking out the originators of cyberattacks
aimed at this country and neutralizing them through counterstrikes and
the insertion of malware for future activation]{.underline}. "Defending
forward as close as possible to the origin of adversary activity extends
our reach to expose adversaries' weaknesses, learn their intentions and
capabilities, and counter attacks close to their origins."16

[In embracing this strategy]{.underline}, Nakasone and other [senior
officials insist that their intention is defensive]{.underline}: to
protect U.S. cyberspace against attack and deter future assaults by
letting opponents know their own systems will be crippled if they
persist in malicious behavior. "For any nation that's taking cyber
activity against the United States," said National Security Advisor John
Bolton when announcing the adoption of NSPM-13, "they should expect...we
will respond offensively as well as defensively."17 [For any potential
adversary following these developments, defending forward will certainly
be interpreted as preparation for offensive strikes in]{.underline} the
event of [a crisis, inviting stepped up defensive and offensive
moves]{.underline} on their part.

Much less is known about the strategic cyberwar policies of other
powers, but they likely parallel those of the United States.
[China]{.underline}, for example, [has long been known to employ
cyberspace to spy on U.S. military technological
capabilities]{.underline} and steal what they can for use in developing
their own weapons systems. [Russia has been even more aggressive in its
use of cyberspace]{.underline}, employing cyberweapons to cripple
Ukraine's electrical grid in 2015 and to influence elections. That
Moscow has also sought to infiltrate the U.S. electrical grid suggests
that [it]{.underline} too [intends to defend forward, by preparing for
possible cyberattacks on U.S.]{.underline} command, control, and
communications capabilities, including [NC3 facilities]{.underline}.

Although occurring largely in secret, what can aptly be called "[an arms
race in cyberspace" is underway]{.underline}. Where this might lead is
difficult to foresee, but it is certain to involve the development of
ever more potent cyberweapons. Each nuclear power will seek to enhance
its defenses against future cyberattack. Yet, just as is the case in
missile warfare, [it is easier and cheaper to devise new offensive
cybersystems than defensive ones. In]{.underline} the event of [a
crisis]{.underline}, then, [there will be a strong temptation to employ
the new technologies early in the encounter, when they might be used to
maximum effect, setting in motion an escalatory process resulting in
nuclear weapons use]{.underline}. As noted, the mere fact that
disruptive malware is known to have been embedded in the vital
command-and-control systems of a nuclear power could lead it to distrust
its early-warning and intelligence systems and, in a panicky response to
ambiguous signals, assume the worst and launch its nuclear weapons.

Arms Control in Cyberspace

Given the various ways in which conflict in cyberspace could result in
nuclear weapons use, [steps must be taken to minimize the risk of
escalation from one domain to the other]{.underline}, but conceiving of
agreements to curb malicious and escalatory behavior in cyberspace is no
easy task. Computer software cannot readily be classified and counted
the way planes and missiles can, and [states do not agree on definitions
of offensive and defensive cyberweapons, let alone on measures to
control them. Nevertheless, some efforts have been made to develop rules
and protocols to restrain]{.underline} the [destabilizing use of
cybertechnologies, and these provide a framework for further
consideration]{.underline}.

Perhaps the most extensive effort to adopt rules for acceptable behavior
in cyberspace has been undertaken by the United Nations, in accordance
with a series of General Assembly resolutions on the topic. This process
first gained momentum in December 2011, when that body, "expressing
concern" that emerging cybertechnologies "can potentially be used for
purposes that are inconsistent with the objectives of maintaining
international stability and security," established a group of
governmental experts to assess the dangers in cyberspace and consider
"possible cooperative measures to address them, including norms, rules,
or principles of responsible behavior of States."18

In its initial report, released in June 2013, the experts group warned
of increasing threats to the safety of what it described as the realm of
information and communications technology (ICT). "States are concerned,"
it noted, "that embedding harmful hidden functions in ICTs could be used
in ways that affect secure and reliable ICT use...and damage national
security." With this in mind, it affirmed a basic principle:
"International law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations,
is applicable" in the ICT domain. On this basis, it called on member
states to work together in "the application of norms derived from
existing international law relevant to the use of ICTs." Furthermore, as
part of this effort, it recommended the crafting of confidence-building
measures, such as the creation of information-sharing mechanisms to
investigate serious cybersecurity incidents, aimed at minimizing the
risk of unintended consequences.19

As the evidence of dangerous developments in cyberspace multiplied, UN
General Assembly Resolution 68/243, called for the formation of a new
experts group to consider restraints on ICT malpractice. That body
released its report in July 2015, providing the most comprehensive
blueprint to date for the management of cyberspace. Building on the
earlier experts group report, it articulated a set of norms that should
govern behavior in this realm. [Foremost among these was the precept
that states "should not conduct]{.underline} or knowingly support [ICT
activity contrary to]{.underline} its obligations under
[**i**nternational law that intentionally damages critical
infrastructure or]{.underline} otherwise [impairs the use and operation
of critical infrastructure" of another country]{.underline}. Other norms
articulated in the report include the proviso that states should not
allow their territory to be used for "internationally wrongful acts
using ICTs" and should seek to "prevent the proliferation of malicious
ICT tools and techniques and the use of harmful hidden functions."20

[By articulating a set of fundamental norms, the 2015 experts group
report provides a useful starting point for further consideration of
arms control in cyberspace. **Lacking any decision-making
authority**]{.underline}, however, [the UN group in advocating for those
norms called only for **conversations among states**]{.underline} on
their implementation and the adoption of "voluntary, non-binding norms"
for responsible behavior. The General Assembly, addressing the topic on
several occasions since then, has only reiterated the principles of the
2015 report and called on member states to follow its guidance without
achieving any obvious, genuine progress.

Several other initiatives have been undertaken by states and nonstate
entities to promote restraint in cyberspace. In February 2017, Brad
Smith, the president of Microsoft, called for the formulation of a
"Digital Geneva Convention," modeled on the existing, post-World War II
Geneva Conventions, aimed at protecting civilians from the negative
consequences of cyberattacks.21 Some academics, including scholars at
the Notre Dame Institute for Advanced Study, have carried this notion
further, calling for the worldwide embrace of \"cyberpeace\" based on
the adoption of common norms and rules.22 "Just as the world's
governments came together in 1949 to adopt the Fourth Geneva Convention
to protect civilians in times of war," he declared, "[we need a Digital
Geneva Convention that will commit governments to implement the norms
that have been developed to protect civilians on the internet in times
of peace]{.underline}."

President Emmanuel [Macron]{.underline} of France has advocated for
similar measures at the international level. In November 2018, he
[unveiled the "Paris Call for Trust and Security in
Cyberspace]{.underline}" at a major gathering in the French capital.
Essentially a rewording of past UN resolutions and the 2015 experts
group report, it called for international cooperation in reducing
malicious behavior, especially cybercrime and political warfare.23
Although signed by leaders of more than 50 countries, including France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom, President Donald [**Trump
refused to endorse** the Paris call]{.underline}, presumably [because it
might infringe on U.S. plans to employ cyberweapons in an offensive
mode]{.underline} (no reasons were provided for the U.S. refusal to
sign).24

[At this point, the likelihood]{.underline} that **[the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [Russia, and China will
adopt and respect international constraints on the use of cyberweapons
aimed at the critical information and communications systems of their
adversaries appears virtually nil]{.underline}. Nevertheless, it is
vitally important that UN officials, industry figures, and prominent
national leaders continue to articulate such norms and call for their
adoption. [Hopefully, these precepts will form the basis for **binding
international agreements**, when enough key governments are prepared to
embrace such measures]{.underline}. In the meantime, it is essential
that policymakers and arms control advocates pursue other routes to arms
control in cyberspace.

Perhaps [the most promising approach]{.underline} in this regard [is the
adoption of formal or informal agreements to eschew certain behaviors
that would increase the risk of unintended or accidental nuclear
escalation. This would involve **meetings between U.S. and Russian
officials**]{.underline}, possibly under the auspices of the currently
suspended Strategic Stability Dialogue; [**between U.S. and Chinese
officials**; or **possibly all three together** aimed at identifying
certain rules of the road to which all sides would agree to adhere, such
as a ban on the implantation of malware in the NC3 systems of their
adversaries]{.underline}.

[A precedent for]{.underline} such [high-level accords is]{.underline}
provided by U.S. President Barack [Obama's]{.underline} September 2015
[agreement with]{.underline} Chinese President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping
[to bar the use of cyberspace for the theft of intellectual
property]{.underline}. Although there is widespread debate over the
extent to which China has abided by the 2015 accord, there is general
agreement that it did result for a time in a diminished level of Chinese
cyberespionage in the United States.25

Such an approach was advanced by Stoutland and Pitts-Kieter in their
2018 study of cyberweapons and nuclear stability. "As a priority first
step," they said, "[the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[should]{.underline} seek to **[initiate a bilateral dialogue with
Russia]{.underline}**" intended [to "develop mutual understanding on how
cyber threats can affect deterrence and strategic
stability]{.underline}." Such talks, they wrote, "should be held [with a
view toward developing a shared understanding of our mutual interest in
minimizing that risk and identifying practical ways to address it
bilaterally and multilaterally]{.underline}."26

At present, none of these approaches for the control of cyberspace
appears to be making any headway. As a consequence, [the arms race in
cyberspace is rapidly gaining momentum, greatly increasing the
likelihood that future confrontations among the major powers will entail
the early use of sophisticated cyberweapons, **magnifying the risk of
rapid and uncontrolled nuclear escalation**]{.underline}. Because [this
danger has received far less attention than other pathways to
escalation, it is **essential**]{.underline} that
[policymakers]{.underline} and arms control advocates [devote far more
effort to controlling cyberspace]{.underline} than they have up until
now.

#### Any direct conflict with Russia would quickly draw in other powers and cause extinction

CJ **Atkins 22**, Ph.D. in political science from York University in
Toronto, March 17, 2022, "Why a Ukraine 'no-fly zone' would mean the end
of the world...literally"
https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/why-a-ukraine-no-fly-zone-would-mean-the-end-of-the-worldliterally/

The reality is that enforcing a no-fly zone would literally mean that
[NATO (which basically implies U.S.)]{.underline} warplanes and missiles
[would be shooting down Russian planes]{.underline}---American military
personnel killing Russian military personnel.

[That would mean]{.underline} war---**[immediate war]{.underline}**
[between Russia and the 30 nations of the U.S.-dominated NATO
alliance]{.underline}. And a war between Russia and the United States
[could very **easily escalate** to an all-out **nuclear
confrontation**]{.underline}. [Russia already put its nuclear forces on
high alert]{.underline} before the invasion of Ukraine and warned others
to stay out, and [U.S. missiles are always ready to launch at a moment's
notice]{.underline}.

No one should underestimate the consequences at stake.

[A nuclear war between Russia and the United States would mean
**hundreds of millions** of people **dead within**]{.underline} hours,
or even **[minutes.]{.underline}** Washington, New York, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev, London, Paris, Berlin, and so
many more cities would be wiped off the map. In such a nuclear exchange,
it would probably also be hard to keep [other nuclear
powers]{.underline} from being dragged in, so [Beijing, Shanghai,
Taipei, and various metropolises]{.underline} far removed from the war
zone [could also **be vaporized**.]{.underline}

Some voices in the media, well aware of what a no-fly zone would risk,
are willing to gamble the future of humanity. Sam Bowman, editor of the
publication Works in Progress and former executive director of the Adam
Smith Institute, a capitalist think tank, wrote on Twitter on March 14:

"My view is basically that nuclear war is worth risking for some things,
like keeping as much of Europe free and independent of Russia as we can.
But I think that's a hard position to hold if you think **[the
extinction of humanity]{.underline}** is so bad that avoiding it [trumps
everything else]{.underline}."

God save the free market, everything else be damned---so goes the logic
apparently.

Luckily, Biden, other NATO leaders, and most in the U.S. Congress
recognize the reality that [if there is a nuclear war, there won't
be]{.underline} any Europe, any free markets, any humanity, or
**[anything else left]{.underline}**---and so they continue to resist
calls for a no-fly zone, so far.

#### Mounting Russian ASAT capabilities [necessitate]{.underline} a clarification of non-kinetic [response thresholds]{.underline} 

Marcin **Piotrowski '19**, Ph.D. in Political Science from the
University of Warsaw, Analyst with the International Security Program at
the Polish Institute of International Affairs; Polish Institute of
International Affairs, November 14, \"Russia's Approach to
Anti-satellite Weapons and Systems,\"
<https://pism.pl/file/8abbf9bc-8742-4f18-a2e9-c09c73ac69d0>

Implications for the U.S. and NATO. [Russia is **concerned** about the
**U**nited **S**tates' growing **technological advantage** and
**military domination** in **space** and is proposing international laws
aimed at limiting ASAT]{.underline}. At the same time, [the Russian
**authorities** are developing **kinetic** ASAT weapons]{.underline},
which [are]{.underline} [**presented** as a response to similar
projects]{.underline} carried out [by **China**, the U.S. and
**India**.]{.underline} Russia is currently able to add ASAT functions
to missile defence systems such as A-235 and S-400, which can intercept
exo-atmospheric warheads. [In the next few years, it will also be able
to use kinetic ASAT weapons]{.underline} (Rudolf and S-500) [against
civilian and military **satellites** in **l**ow-**e**arth **o**rbit and
to deploy robotic satellites capable of disrupting]{.underline} military
and civilian [satellites in **higher orbits**]{.underline}. Russia's
ASAT weapons are an element of its "asymmetric response" to the
development of the United States' missile defence, new ground-launched
missiles and hypersonic weapons. [**The U.S.** is also
paying]{.underline} close [attention to Russia's]{.underline} visible
and advanced [non-kinetic ASAT capabilities in terms of electronic and
cyber-attacks.]{.underline} These threats from Russia were among the
factors justifying the recent creation of a new space force branch of
the military in the United States.

[The broadening spectrum of Russia's ASAT capabilities also **requires a
response** from NATO and EU states]{.underline}. The Alliance approved a
space policy in June, and the next stage might take place at the
December meeting of NATO heads of state and government in London, where
space will be recognised as a fifth domain of military operations and
the Allies will work on a specific space strategy. NATO's doctrines
current see air and space as one, so need to be updated to take account
of new threats. [**Within NATO** there is a need to address the
implications of ASAT weapons on **Article 4** of the Washington Treaty.
It may be that **non-kinetic disruption** of a satellite belonging to
any NATO member will be the subject of **consultations** under Article
4, and the Alliance could decide]{.underline} that the [**physical
destruction** of a member's satellite may be deemed an **act of
aggression** that would call for **Article 5**]{.underline} to be
invoked. [Allied exercises should incorporate ASAT-attack and
GPS-jamming]{.underline} scenarios in future, particularly when planning
large-scale exercises such as the upcoming Defender 20. Poland's armed
forces technical modernisation programme for the period to 2035 assumes
the acquisition of reconnaissance satellites, so additional protection
from non-kinetic attacks might be necessary. The EU institutions and
countries should use information campaigns to increase awareness among
civilians who rely on satellites vulnerable to non-kinetic ASAT attacks
during peacetime or in hybrid warfare.

### 1AC - Plan

#### The United States federal government should substantially increase its space cybersecurity resilience efforts with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization including at least clarifying response to cyber attacks in space

### 1AC - Solvency

#### International action is key -- US cooperation with NATO secures satellite assets

David **Fidler 18**, the James Louis Calamaras Emeritus Professor of Law
at Indiana University, Adjunct Senior Fellow for Cybersecurity and
Global Health at the Council on Foreign Relations, 4/3/18,
"Cybersecurity and the New Era of Space Activities,"
https://www.cfr.org/report/cybersecurity-and-new-era-space-activities

[The tasks of securing outer space and cyberspace are
converging.]{.underline} The internet increasingly depends on
space-enabled communication and information services. Likewise, [the
operation of satellites and other space assets relies on internet-based
networks]{.underline}, which makes these assets, like cars and medical
equipment, devices on the internet of things. New government actors,
companies, goals, and technologies are expanding and transforming space
activities. However, [neither space policy nor cybersecurity policy is
prepared for the challenges created by the meshing of space and
cyberspace]{.underline}, **[which could increase national security
risks]{.underline}**.

[To meet these challenges, government, industry, and **international
action is needed**]{.underline}. The Donald J. Trump administration's
National Space Council should develop cybersecurity recommendations for
space activities, and federal agencies should prioritize these within
the government and in cooperation with the private sector. In crafting
needed legislation for commercial space activities, Congress should
bolster industry efforts to strengthen cybersecurity. Private-sector
actors should strengthen their adoption of cybersecurity best practices
and collaborate with one another on improving implementation of
cybersecurity strategies. Internationally, [**the United States** should
pursue **collaboration on space cybersecurity** through the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization **(NATO),**]{.underline} [plurilateral
space cooperation mechanisms]{.underline}, and bilateral forums.

Outer space has been a national security priority for spacefaring
nations [since the 1950s. Governments started space
programs]{.underline} for intelligence, military, political, and
scientific purposes [and developed countermeasures against space-based
threats from rivals, such as anti-satellite capabilities]{.underline}.
[Countries managed security competition by banning weapons]{.underline}
of mass destruction in [space and cooperating on peaceful uses of
space]{.underline}. [Government programs catalyzed]{.underline}
private-sector adaptation of [dual-use technologies to provide satellite
communication services]{.underline}.

**[Despite the importance of satellites]{.underline}**, the U.S. General
Accounting Office concluded \[PDF\] in 2002 that [efforts on **critical
infrastructure** protection **did not include the satellite
industry**]{.underline}, but should do so. Similarly, [cybersecurity has
not been a priority in government]{.underline} and private-sector space
endeavors. One leading analysis \[PDF\] asserted that [cybersecurity
discussions often overlook space activities' vulnerability to
cyberattack]{.underline}. For example, neither the UN governmental group
of experts (GGE) on outer space nor the UN GGE on cyberspace addressed
the convergence of their respective agendas.

[Governments, critical infrastructure, and economies rely on
space-dependent services]{.underline}---for example, the Global
Positioning System (GPS)---[that are vulnerable to hostile cyber
operations]{.underline}. [Geopolitical competition fuels the
militarization of space, which heightens state incentives to devise
cyber espionage, interference, and attack strategies against rivals'
space operations]{.underline}. The United States suspects that China has
engaged in cyber operations against U.S. satellites. Chinese military
writings emphasize \[PDF\] the need to target satellites to "blind and
deafen the enemy." The then commander of Air Force Space Command,
General John E. Hyten, told Congress in 2016 that "[adversaries are
developing . . . cyber tools to deny, degrade, and destroy]{.underline}"
\[PDF\] [U.S. space capabilities that support war fighting, critical
infrastructure, and economic activity.]{.underline} Other countries
likely believe the United States is preparing to conduct cyber
espionage, disruption, and attack operations against the space assets of
rival states.

The commercialization of space heightens cybersecurity concerns for many
reasons, including market incentives to lower costs and innovate
quickly, often at the expense of software and hardware security.
Entrepreneurial activities---dubbed the New Space sector---are underway
in space transport, space tourism, asteroid mining, lunar operations,
and missions to Mars. [A small-satellite ("smallsat")
revolution]{.underline} involving spacecraft far smaller than
traditional satellites [is unfolding.]{.underline} Networks of linked
smallsats can provide internet access, communications, data storage and
transmission, imaging, and remote sensing. [This next generation of
satellites harnesses innovations in]{.underline} computing, electronics,
miniaturization, imaging, sensors, [big data, and artificial
intelligence]{.underline}. [**Satellite services**]{.underline} for
Earth observations from space **[are growing]{.underline}**. They
support many policy and commercial purposes [and contribute to
**agricultural productivity**, transportation efficiency, and
**environmental monitoring**]{.underline}. Commercial space activities
use cutting-edge technologies and produce valuable data [and are, thus,
targets for cyber espionage, including economic cyber espionage, and
cybercrime.]{.underline}

Challenges

Space agencies, the satellite industry, cybersecurity researchers,
nongovernmental bodies, and intergovernmental satellite organizations
show increasing awareness of the space cybersecurity challenge.
Nevertheless, experts are worried. NASA's then chief information
security officer, Jeanette Hanna-Ruiz, warned that ["it's a matter of
time before someone hacks into something in space]{.underline}." Chatham
House's David Livingstone asserted that "people are just shuffling . . .
paper around" and suggested that only "a disaster" might catalyze
serious action. Josh Hartman, a former senior Pentagon official and Air
Force officer, argued before the satellite industry's first
cybersecurity summit held in 2017 that, on cybersecurity, "[most of the
space community . . . has their heads in the sand]{.underline}." **[The
"attack surface"]{.underline}** of space activities **[is
expanding,]{.underline}** [but governments and industry are **not taking
adequate action**.]{.underline}

[Protecting space activities requires understanding]{.underline} the
particular [cyber vulnerabilities]{.underline} that arise in various
space operations. For example, satellite cybersecurity encompasses the
satellite itself, transmissions to and from Earth, and ground stations.
[U.S. military and intelligence satellite systems are vulnerable
to]{.underline} kinetic and [cyberattacks. Civilian smallsat
systems]{.underline} might also prove insecure, given the
[lack]{.underline} of [cybersecurity in their design]{.underline}, their
use of commercial off-the-shelf components, and the vulnerabilities
potentially created by connecting satellites to operate as complex,
orbiting networks.

[Neither international law nor diplomacy has grappled effectively with
space cybersecurity]{.underline}. Multiple bodies of international law
are relevant, but [controversies about whether and how international law
applies to cyberspace have adversely affected cyber
diplomacy]{.underline}. Such travails have elevated the prominence of
nongovernmental efforts to clarify international law's application in
cyberspace, such as the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law
Applicable to Cyber Operations. However, [states continue to conduct
cyber operations that violate international law]{.underline}. For
example, the UN International Telecommunication Union prohibits
interference with satellite transmissions, yet such interference
frequently occurs.

The militarization of space potentially threatens the requirement in the
Outer Space Treaty (OST) that space activities comply with international
law to maintain international peace and security and promote
international cooperation. [The United States has declared that **space
is now a "war-fighting domain**,]{.underline}" [and China's and Russia's
military ambitions in space are growing]{.underline}. The UN Committee
on Disarmament's work on a treaty to prevent an arms race in space
failed. As happened with cyberspace, these difficulties in space
diplomacy [have increased nongovernmental interest in clarifying how
international law applies to military operations in space]{.underline}.

The commercialization of space fuels concerns that the private sector
will unduly influence how states interpret the OST's duty to authorize
and supervise nongovernmental space activities. The debate over whether
U.S. support for commercial space activities violates this OST
requirement might also create diplomatic problems.

New diplomatic initiatives on space cybersecurity would encounter
headwinds. Putting "space" before "cybersecurity" does not alleviate the
geopolitical tensions that already limit cooperation on cyberspace and
space. The United States, China, and Russia have not agreed on how to
approach cybersecurity or address military activities in space. Recent
diplomatic activities on space and cybersecurity concluded without
addressing space cybersecurity, including the UN GGEs on cyberspace and
outer space and the European Union's code of conduct for space
activities \[PDF\]. Negotiations in the UN Committee on Peaceful Uses of
Outer Space on guidelines for the long-term sustainability of space
activities considered but did not adopt proposed guidelines \[PDF\] on
information-security policies for the terrestrial and orbital parts of
space systems. Controversies and disagreements during these efforts
suggest that reopening them for space cybersecurity would not be
effective. Further, the increased number of spacefaring nations, which
now includes such countries as South Korea and the United Arab Emirates,
complicates diplomacy by requiring more countries to reach consensus.

States might also believe more diplomatic activity is not necessary
because they already have sufficient incentives to refrain from
dangerous cyber operations in space. Disabling a satellite through cyber
means could turn it into space debris---already a major problem---that
threatens space activities for all countries. The importance of
intelligence satellites in maintaining nuclear deterrence also
encourages restraint in interfering with the satellites of rival nuclear
powers. Following trends on Earth, countries might want to avoid
diplomatic activity in order to engage in cyber operations in space that
"subvert the integrity of political, social, and economic systems,
rather than destroy physical infrastructure" by, for example,
manipulating or hijacking an adversary's space infrastructure to spread
propaganda and misinformation.

Recommendations

Government

The United States can provide leadership on cybersecurity in outer space
through a comprehensive strategy. The Trump administration is positioned
to advance space cybersecurity because its priorities include improving
critical infrastructure cybersecurity, addressing security threats to
space operations \[PDF\], and promoting commercial space activities. The
administration resurrected the National Space Council and should task it
with developing recommendations on strengthening the cybersecurity of
space infrastructure. To do so, the council should convene government
officials and leaders from the commercial space sector to share insights
on managing cybersecurity as space and cyberspace merge. These leaders
should include people who have led both information technology and space
enterprises, such as Paul Allen (Stratolaunch Systems), Jeff Bezos (Blue
Origin), and Elon Musk (SpaceX). The Trump administration should
instruct the Department of Commerce, Department of Homeland Security,
Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Communications Commission, and
NASA to make cybersecurity a priority in their space collaborations with
the private sector.

With private-sector space activities expanding, Congress should adopt a
comprehensive regulatory framework for the commercial space sector.
Current law does not regulate the full range of space activities the
private sector is planning, a problem recognized \[PDF\] but not
addressed during the Barack Obama administration. A comprehensive
framework would provide commercial space enterprises with regulatory
certainty and help the United States comply with its OST obligation to
authorize and supervise nongovernmental space activities. The
legislation should emphasize the importance of existing federal law on
cybersecurity information sharing, provide government assistance to
industry-led efforts to strengthen space cybersecurity (especially
concerning threats from state actors), and---as happened in other
sectors, such as energy---facilitate public-private collaborations on
cybersecurity.

Industry

Improving space cybersecurity requires extending good cybersecurity
practices into the commercial space sector and addressing problems
specific to space activities. Advice for this sector repeats familiar
mantras, such as the need for intra-sector collaboration, information
sharing, enterprise risk management, encryption, insider threat
prevention, and supply chain protection. The federal government has, for
example, rightly stressed \[PDF\] the utility of the Cybersecurity
Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity \[PDF\]
for satellite companies.

Industry associations in space sectors should move from identifying
general principles and recommendations, such as those in the Joint
Statement on the Satellite Industry's Commitment to Cybersecurity, to
supporting implementation activities. The Satellite Industry Association
could, for example, include in its annual State of the Satellite
Industry Report \[PDF\] information on the industry's cybersecurity
activities, as is done in other industries.

International

The difficulty of reaching multilateral agreement on cybersecurity and
space issues means [the United States should address space cybersecurity
in plurilateral]{.underline} and bilateral [contexts]{.underline}.
**[The United States should raise space cybersecurity within
NATO]{.underline}**, [given the alliance's plans to upgrade its
satellite and cyber defense capabilities. U.S.]{.underline} bilateral
[cybersecurity cooperation with spacefaring countries]{.underline}, such
as India and Japan, [should include space cybersecurity]{.underline}.
With their history of collaboration, NASA and the European Space Agency,
which is increasingly aware of cybersecurity threats to its programs,
should sign a memorandum of understanding to cooperate on space
cybersecurity.

More ambitiously[, the United States should use effective mechanisms of
space diplomacy to improve space cybersecurity]{.underline}. For
example, the International Space Station (ISS) has involved the United
States, Canada, Japan, Russia, and the European Space Agency managing
the "the most politically complex space exploration program ever
undertaken." The United States should discuss the need for more
cooperation on space cybersecurity within the ISS framework. In
addition, the United States could lead establishment of an
intergovernmental coordination mechanism for developing guidance on
space cybersecurity. The mechanism could be modeled on the Inter-Agency
Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC), composed of space agencies
from leading spacefaring countries. The IADC's nonbinding guidelines are
credited with reducing space debris produced by new launches.

Conclusion

[Actions at the]{.underline} national, industry, and [international
levels can harness growing awareness about space cybersecurity and
strengthen policy]{.underline} and industry practices [as the
convergence of space and cyberspace accelerates]{.underline}. Outer
space might not be the "final frontier for cybersecurity," but
**[achieving cybersecurity beyond Earth]{.underline}** [is one of the
many responsibilities the new era of space activities creates for
governments]{.underline} and societies.

sg

THE EMERGING ANTI-SATELLITE THREAT

The [threat to **U.S**. and **allied** space systems from anti-satellite
weapons continues to grow]{.underline}. As former Director of National
Intelligence Dan Coats noted in testimony before Congress in January
2019: "[**China** and **Russia** are training and equipping]{.underline}
their military [space forces and fielding new **anti-satellite weapons**
to hold]{.underline} U.S. and allied space [systems at
risk]{.underline}." Coats' testimony is complemented by numerous reports
and studies by government and non-governmental organizations like the
Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Air and Space Intelligence
Center, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the
Secure World Foundation.

NATO has also been the victim of real-world anti-satellite activities.
In March 2019, the Norwegian government accused Russia of "harassing"
communications systems during NATO exercises. Recent press reporting
notes that the Norwegian Intelligence Service has documented a number of
incidents in which "GPS signals and other secured communications between
the Norwegian Armed forces, or NAF, units engaged in exercises were
subjected to 'blocking' measures from sites located in Russia." And just
last week, U.S. Space Command released a statement claiming that on
April 15th, Russia had conducted a direct-ascent anti-satellite missile
test. Faced with these real threats, how should NATO respond?

[IMPROVE **INTELLIGENCE-SHARING**]{.underline}

[Collective action]{.underline} by NATO on outer space security issues
[will only happen when allies reach a consensus]{.underline} on the
anti-satellite threat. As a first step, an appropriate organization at
NATO (e.g., the Assistant Secretary General for Intelligence) should be
directed to develop a comprehensive assessment of the anti-satellite
threat to the alliance.

[To be successful, this effort will require the **full support** of the
U.S.]{.underline} intelligence community. Additionally, NATO officials
should ensure relevant alliance political and military bodies (e.g., the
North Atlantic Council, Military Committee, Senior Political Committee,
and Defense Policy and Planning Committee) receive regular updates on
the anti-satellite threat.

MAINSTREAM OUTER SPACE AT NATO

[NATO should ensure that **outer space** is "**mainstreamed**"
and]{.underline} fully [integrated within alliance]{.underline}
political and military [institutions]{.underline}, and is not treated as
merely a "novelty item." For instance, overall responsibility for outer
space should be placed in an organization like the Office of the
Assistant Secretary General for Defense Policy and Planning, or the
Office of the Assistant Secretary General for Defense Investment, which
are responsible for defense policy, planning, and capability investment
at NATO. Furthermore, noting the interrelationship between outer space
and other domains like nuclear and cyber, [NATO will need to **establish
mechanisms** that encourage]{.underline} effective
[coordination]{.underline} and cooperation across the entire
organization, including the military commands.

At the operational level, the [alliance should ensure that **outer
space** is incorporated in its major **military exercises**]{.underline}
and wargames. This is critical because [if **NATO**]{.underline} ever
[comes into]{.underline} a major [conflict]{.underline} with Russia,
[one of Russia's first targets would be the alliance's **space
assets**]{.underline} and space-derived information. Therefore, it is
important for NATO to conduct its exercises with this in mind. Allied
Command Transformation, NATO's warfare development command, should be
tasked to make this a reality.

ENSURE COOPERATION AND COORDINATION WITH THE UNITED STATES

At the end of the day, [NATO's **ultimate effectiveness**]{.underline}
in outer space [will depend on its cooperation with]{.underline} the
alliance's most important space power: [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. To date, U.S. [leadership has been the **key
driver** of]{.underline} NATO [decisionmaking]{.underline} on outer
space, and [senior]{.underline} U.S. [officials have]{.underline}
actively [engaged the **alliance leadership**]{.underline}. For example,
in October 2019, General John Raymond, commander of U.S. Space Command
and chief of space operations, briefed the NATO Military Committee on
outer space security issues. These types of senior-level engagements
between U.S. political and military leaders should continue and be
expanded.

In addition to senior-level engagements, there are a [number of other
actions NATO]{.underline} and the United States [could take to improve
cooperation]{.underline} and coordination. Specifically, [they should
establish clear **consultative mechanisms** between **NATO**, **U.S.
Space Command**, and the **U.S. Space Force**]{.underline}. One
relatively easy step that could be taken quickly would be to [establish
a **NATO liaison officer** at U.S. Space Command]{.underline} and/or
U.S. Space Force headquarters. Indeed, a number of allied officers are
currently attached as liaisons at several U.S. combatant commands like
U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM).

The **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[should]{.underline} also seek to [incorporate NATO]{.underline}
representatives [into its outer **space-related wargames**]{.underline}
where possible, especially the Schriever Wargame, the premier U.S. space
wargame. According to a U.S. Air Force press release, several allies
including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France,
Germany, and Japan, have participated in previous Schriever Wargames.
The United States should invite NATO political and military officials to
participate in the next Schriever Wargame.

#### NATO unity is key -- interoperability in space enables effective communication

[Interoperability enables allies to operate their space systems without
having to make adaptations]{.underline} so that their systems can
function efficiently.

[Interoperability has been an issue in the land, air, and maritime
domains]{.underline}. **[Space-assets planning would
benefit]{.underline}** from the lessons learned in those domains -- for
instance, [by studying and understanding the complexities
involved]{.underline} in intelligence- and information-sharing across
all domains. Allies could allocate funds towards a body of work that
could focus on interoperability in space. Doctrines and [standardization
could help to improve interoperability among allied
systems]{.underline}. Yet, allies should also realize that
standardization would mean using the same vectors as a baseline, thus
leading to an increase in risk (in the remaining vulnerabilities) across
the alliance as a whole.

Allies should realize that standardization would mean using the same
vectors as a baseline, thus leading to an increase in risk across the
alliance as a whole.

In order to share secure information through SATCOM units, France,
Germany, Norway and the US have formed the multilateral Coalition
Network for Secure Information Sharing (CoNSIS). [Through secure
communications systems]{.underline}, CoNSIS's [objective is to enable
better and more accurate decision-making, within a shorter period of
time]{.underline}.71 In order to ease interoperability, CoNSIS uses
commercial standards as its baseline.72 [For future applications, it is
advisable to check whether commercial standards meet cybersecurity
demands for military requirements.]{.underline}

**[Interoperability in technology is desirable]{.underline}** but
remains a challenging construct. [It could become **the role of NATO to
make** national **space services interoperable**.]{.underline} Creating
a catalogue of national services might be a good starting point.
[Interoperability could also be established]{.underline} at the product
level (for example, in the field of space weather information) [where
the products are standardized across the alliance]{.underline}. In order
to incentivize nations to invest in this endeavour, it might be helpful
to calculate the cost of inadequate interoperability across the alliance
to demonstrate current or potential monetary losses.

# 2AC Case

## 2AC -- China Adv

### 2AC -- Cyber Solves

#### Only revitalizing [NATO cooperation]{.underline} can stop a [Sinocentric world order]{.underline}\-\--failure to mobilize various [geographic focuses]{.underline} allows numerous [cyberspace threats]{.underline}. 

Liselotte **Odgaard 22**, professor at the Norwegian Institute for
Defense Studies, 2/24/2022, \"NATO's China Role: Defending Cyber and
Outer Space,\" *Washington Quarterly*, 45(1), pp 175-180,

Rather than highlighting the need for a division of labor within NATO,
the 2022 invasion has highlighted that Russia's appetite for threatening
Europe with military action is closely entwined with its long-standing
strategic cooperation with China. Intelligence reports that [China told
Russia]{.underline} in February 2022 [not to invade Ukraine before
the]{.underline} end of the **[Winter Olympics]{.underline}** in Beijing
testify to the closely orchestrated Chinese-Russian approach to the
West.18 [**Moscow** and **Beijing** are both]{.underline} **[strategic
opponents]{.underline}** of the US, a shared status that has spurred
them to coordinate their separate geostrategic priorities in Europe and
the Indo-Pacific, forging unison pushback against what they consider
Western encroachments on their spheres of interest.19 The poorer than
expected performance of the Russian armed forces in its 2022 war with
Ukraine has pushed China to try to appear neutral. Nevertheless,
[China]{.underline} has [joined Russia in opposing]{.underline} further
[**enlargement** of NATO]{.underline}, and in the Indo-Pacific, [Russia
has joined China in opposing Taiwanese independence]{.underline}.20 It
would be wise for Europe and the US to plan **[for Sino-Russian
geostrategic coordination]{.underline}** to continue unless more clear
evidence that China will abandon Russia is presented. One thing is
certain: [China will work with]{.underline} the [partners that help it
advance a **Sinocentric international order**]{.underline} based on
authoritarian regimes. And to counter this development, Europe and the
United States need to devise effective mechanisms for joint responses to
Beijing as well as to Moscow.

A US-European division of labor is not likely to help NATO develop tools
to defend itself against threats from China and Russia. The lack of
electronic warfare in Russia's war with Ukraine has revealed gaps
between its concept of operations and the tactics of the Ukrainian
military. As demonstrated in prior operations in Syria and the Donbas,
Russia will adapt and learn in the short and long term. For example,
[Russia can be expected to improve its **electromagnetic spectrum
management**]{.underline} in order [to enhance its planning]{.underline}
and management of forces on the battlefield. Meanwhile, [China is
watching the **performance** of the parties involved in the
war]{.underline} with a view [to update its **cyber and space
capabilities**]{.underline} as well as strategic concepts. As a
consequence, both Russian and Chinese [threats will continue to
**increasingly emerge** in the cyber and space domains. This calls for
**global**]{.underline} and functional [defenses rather than an
**exclusive geographical focus**]{.underline}. [It is more important
than ever to design NATO for a future where threats]{.underline} toward
**[transatlantic security]{.underline}** [are global]{.underline} and
requires a unified response.

### 2AC -- Deterrence Solves

#### There are growing cyber threats to the NATO's satellites -- Russia and China are rapidly advancing their cyber capabilities and have the potential to attack the NATO's space based assets

Karl-Heinz **Brunner 21**, member NATO Parliamentary Assembly and the
Bundestag Defence Committee and Subcommittee on Disarmament, Arms
Control, and Non-Proliferation, October 2021, "Space and Security --
NATO's Role," NATO Parliamentary Assembly, Science and Technology

42\. [Space denial capabilities of NATO (near-)peer competitors have
significantly increased in recent years, and so have the number of tests
of such technologies. Several countries possess weapon systems that have
the potential to **harm space assets at any time**.]{.underline}
According to CSIS's 2020-Space Threat Assessment there are four types of
systems that can be used to damage or destroy space-based assets
(Harrison, Johnson, Roberts, Way, & Young, 2020): [(1) kinetic physical
counterspace weapons, built to directly strike satellites or the ground
stations operating them; (2) non-kinetic weapons, including lasers, high
powered microwave (HPM) weapons, and electromagnetic pulse (EMP)
weapons, that can physically affect space assets without any direct
contact; (3) electronic attacks targeting signal transmissions to and
from satellites by interfering with radio-frequencies (RF) by creating
noise in the same frequencies (jamming) or by falsifying a signal and
tricking the receiver into it (spoofing), thus corrupting the data; (4)
**cyberattacks, that target data instead of transmission
frequencies**.]{.underline} 43. Kinetic physical counterspace weapons
have attracted the most attention by far. Tests of direct-ascent
anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons have increased as more countries develop
capabilities in this domain (Harrison, Johnson, Roberts, Way, & Young,
2020). The most prominent of these tests has arguably been the
destruction of a satellite by China in 2007 which increased space debris
in LEO by roughly 10% and was followed by broad international
condemnation (Ohlandt, McClintock, & Flanagan, 2021). A more recent ASAT
test by China, conducted in 2018, was further evidence of Beijing's
growing prowess and ambition in space. Building on extensive experience
from Soviet-era ASAT-programmes, Russia has also invested in numerous
kinetic physical counterspace capabilities and allegedly has a range of
ground-based and air-launched directascent ASAT missiles that could
target satellites at its disposal (Harrison, Johnson, Roberts G., Way, &
Young, 2020). 44. In addition to direct-ascent systems, co-orbital
ASAT-weapons have also already been deployed in space. Their activity is
more difficult to detect, however, as it is very similar to on-orbit
maintenance or debris removal missions. As most space technologies,
co-orbital weapons are a dual-use technology and can be used for both
civilian and military purposes. Arguably, any asset in the orbits above
earth can be qualified as a weapon just because of its high velocity.
With speeds between 11,000 (GEO) and 28,000 (LEO) kilometres per hour, a
satellite that changes orbit becomes a kinetic weapon by definition. 45.
Some of the most advanced space denial assets have been developed and
tested by the People's Republic of China (PRC). [The Pentagon's annual
China military power report notes that Beijing's space capabilities
include orbiting space robots (U.S. Department of Defense, 2020).
Similarly, Russia has repeatedly launched inspection-satellites into
LEO, which could potentially serve as co-orbital ASAT weapons. Although
Moscow has not officially announced any plans to develop space based
ASAT weapons, US Space Command accused the Kremlin of testing such
weapons-systems under the guise of maintenance in 2020 (US Space
Command, 2020).]{.underline} 46. Other than China and Russia, numerous
other states are working on counter-space capabilities (Raju, 2020).
[The threat is also illustrated by the **variety of modes of action
against satellites**: missiles, co-orbital, jamming, directed energy and
cyber (Weeden & Samson, 2020).]{.underline} Research and development in
these areas is significant, progress is rapid, and some capabilities
such as jamming are already in use, in the Middle East (BBC, 2012) or to
disrupt NATO exercises in the High North (Deutsche Welle, 2018). Even
civilian systems, such as those intended for rendezvous and proximity
operations to dock with a space station or perform maintenance, could be
dual-use and pose a threat in the vicinity of military satellites or
those providing services essential to our economies and lifestyles. 47.
[While receiving less public attention than their kinetic counterparts,
non-kinetic weapon systems such as lasers and electronic technologies
enabling jamming or spoofing have also been increasingly developed and
tested.]{.underline} According to the Rand Corporation, China continues
to develop space weapons and has developed jamming capabilities and
tested them in exercises (Manson & Shepherd, 2020). 48. [The development
of China's non-kinetic capabilities dates back to the purchase of
Soviet-era equipment from Ukraine in the late 1990s (CSIS, 2018). Since
then, Beijing's indigenous space industry has made the ability to jam
satellite communications **one of its priorities** (USCC, 2015) and has
developed and tested several systems]{.underline} (DIA, 2019). China's
electronic warfare capacity includes an ionospheric radar located on the
island of Hainan that is able to influence particles up to 2,000
kilometres. In 2020, officials announced an airborne laser which,
although developed to target military aircraft or missiles, could
potentially be used against satellites (Zhen, 2020). 49[. Russia, too,
has been consistently enhancing its space denial capabilities. The state
armament programme for the period until 2027 lists the development of
defensive space-based systems deployed to protect Russian satellites
(Zak, 2018). Moreover, Russia is commonly believed to be testing
electronic counterspace warfare, **jamming and spoofing adversaries'
satellites** in conflict zones as well as in nearby
territories]{.underline} (Harrison, Johnson, Roberts, Way, & Young,
2020) and even on GPS-Satellites within its own state borders (BBC,
2018). 50. Finally, several actors in space have developed substantial
knowledge in the cyber realm. [As cyber-attacks are significantly
cheaper and much harder to attribute than direct-ascent or co-orbital
ASAT, they are a **compelling alternative** to these weapon systems.
Russia has demonstrated its cyber capabilities as early as 1998, when it
allegedly took control of a US-German satellite, pointed it at the Sun
and thus destroyed its instruments (Tucker, 2019). The Chinese
government appears to also have tested its cyber capabilities in several
instances such as during the 2014 National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) hack (Al-Rodhan, 2020).]{.underline} The attack
disrupted weather information and impacted end users around the globe
(Al-Rodhan, 2020). [More generally, research and development in space
denial capabilities is significant, progress is rapid, and some
capabilities, such as jamming, are already in use,]{.underline} for
example in the Middle East (BBC, 2012) or to disrupt NATO exercises in
the High North (Deutsche Welle, 2018).

### 2AC -- Yes China Attack

#### China and Russia are already beginning to be aggressive -- they are developing weapons that will be used to commit acts of war in space. 

**Rogin '21** (Josh Rogin, columnist for the Global Opinions section of
The Washington Post and political analyst for CNN. "A shadow war in
space is heating up fast" 11/30/21,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/11/30/space-race-china-david-thompson/)

When Russia blows up a satellite in space with a missile ([as it did
this month](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59299101)), or
when China tests a new hypersonic missile ([as it did last
month](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2021-11/news/china-tested-hypersonic-capability-us-says)),
the ongoing arms race in space leaps into the news. But in between these
"[Sputnik](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/us/politics/china-hypersonic-missile.html)"-like
moments, outside the public's view, the [United States and its
adversaries are battling in space every day.]{.underline}

While Washington officials and experts [warn of the
risks](https://www.rand.org/blog/2020/10/how-to-avoid-a-space-arms-race.html) of
an arms race in space, the United States' [adversaries are constantly
conducting operations against U.S. satellites that skirt the line
between intelligence operations and acts of war]{.underline}. The pace
of conflict is intensifying, according to a top Space Force general, who
told me that [China could overtake the United States to become the
number one power in space by the end of the decade.]{.underline}

"The threats are really growing and expanding every single day. And it's
really an evolution of activity that's been happening for a long time,"
Gen. David Thompson, the Space Force's first vice chief of space
operations, told me in an interview on the sidelines of the
recent [Halifax International Security
Forum](https://halifaxtheforum.org/). "We're really at a point now where
there's a whole host of ways that our space systems can be threatened."

[John W. "Jay" Raymond: How the U.S. Space Force is trying to bring
order to increasingly messy outer
space](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/11/29/space-activity-its-debris-increases-us-works-establish-international-norms-rules/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_6)

Right now, Space Force is dealing with what Thompson calls "reversible
attacks" on U.S. government satellites (meaning attacks that don't
permanently damage the satellites) "every single day." Both [China and
Russia are regularly attacking U.S. satellites with non-kinetic means,
including lasers, radio frequency jammers and cyber attacks, he
said.]{.underline}

Thompson repeatedly declined to comment on whether China or Russia has
attacked a U.S. military satellite in a way that did permanent or
significant damage, telling me that would be classified if it had
happened. The [Chinese military is quickly deploying ground-based
systems for doing battle in space, [such as
lasers](https://spacenews.com/op-ed-u-s-satellites-increasingly-vulnerable-to-chinas-ground-based-lasers/) that
can [damage nosy U.S. intelligence community
satellites](https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/space-lasers-and-the-new-battlefield-emerging-under-china-s-anti-satellite-tactics-20210804-p58ft2.html),
which could be considered an act of war.]{.underline}

"The Chinese are actually well ahead \[of Russia\]," Thompson said.
"They\'re fielding operational systems at an incredible rate."

Both the [Russians and the Chinese are working on satellites that can
attack other satellites]{.underline}, he said. For some time now there
have been reports that China was developing a [satellite that could
claw](https://medium.com/war-is-boring/chinas-mystery-satellite-could-be-a-dangerous-new-weapon-630a858923ec) another
satellite or [grab one with a robotic
arm](https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-satellite-launch-space-weapons) or
a grappling hook. The Chinese government has several reasons to want to
disable U.S. satellites, which have been useful in revealing
concentration camps built to intern Uyghur Muslims and [new Chinese
nuclear missile silo
fields](https://fas.org/blogs/security/2021/07/china-is-building-a-second-nuclear-missile-silo-field/).

In 2019, Russia deployed a small satellite into an orbit so close to a
U.S. "national security satellite" that the U.S. government didn't know
whether it was attacking or not, Thompson said. Then, the Russian
satellite backed away and conducted a weapons test. It released a small
target and then shot it with a projectile.

"It maneuvered close, it maneuvered dangerously, it maneuvered
threateningly so that they were coming close enough that there was a
concern of collision," he said. "So clearly, the Russians were sending
us a message."

China is building its own version of satellite-based global positioning
systems, said Thompson. That's in addition to the "couple of hundred"
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance satellites China has now
deployed to watch over any part of the globe. China is also putting
satellites into space at twice the rate of the United States, meaning
that if nothing changes on our end, China will surpass the United States
in capability in space in a few years, he estimated.

"We are still the best in the world, clearly in terms of capability.
They\'re catching up quickly," he said. "We should be concerned by the
end of this decade if we don\'t adapt."

While [China is quickly [weaponizing
space](https://thediplomat.com/2017/01/how-china-is-weaponizing-outer-space/)]{.underline}, [its
government points
fingers](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202109/1235454.shtml) at United
States, claiming that Washington is the diplomatic stumbling
black. [There are
reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/28/us/politics/china-nuclear-arms-race.html) that
the Biden administration is reaching out to Beijing to establish new
negotiations for a nuclear arms control, as well as international norms
for cyberspace and space, but U.S. officials say that China won't
meaningfully engage.

#### Grey zones increase the likelihood of cyber attacks -- those could escalate

official" 02/28/22,
<https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/cyberattack-nato-could-trigger-collective-defence-clause-official-2022-02-28/>)

[A cyberattack on a NATO member state]{.underline} could [trigger
Article 5, its collective defence clause]{.underline}, a NATO official
said on Monday, amid concerns that chaos in cyberspace around Russia\'s
invasion of Ukraine could spill over into other territories.

The military alliance has for years made clear that a serious
cyberattack could trigger the clause, but such a scenario has so far
been largely hypothetical.

\"[Allies]{.underline} also [recognise that the impact of]{.underline}
significant [malicious cumulative cyber activities might]{.underline},
in certain circumstances, [be considered]{.underline} as [an armed
attack]{.underline},\" the official told Reuters.

\"We will not speculate on how serious a cyberattack would have to be in
order to trigger a collective response. Any [response could
include]{.underline} diplomatic and economic sanctions, cyber measures,
or even [conventional forces,]{.underline} depending on the nature of
the attack,\" the official said.

Whether or not a cyberattack met the threshold of an attack large enough
to trigger Article 5 was a \"political decision for NATO Allies to
make,\" they added.

Britain and the United States have warned of potential cyberattacks on
Ukraine which could have international consequences should, for example,
malicious software designed to target networks in Ukraine start to
spread elsewhere.

There has also been [concern among cybersecurity experts that Russia
could team up with some of the gangs and people who release malicious
software, such as malware used to hold Colonial Pipeline to
ransom]{.underline} in the United States last year.

U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner said there were
[no clear guidelines on how NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization)
should respond, should such an attack take place.]{.underline}

\"These are things that have been in hypothetical discussion for a
decade, but because we\'ve not come to any universal conclusion on what
those standards should be, what level of attribution is needed, we\'re
kind of in a [very grey area]{.underline},\" he told Reuters.

He posed the hypothetical case of a Russian cyberattack on Ukraine that
impacts NATO member Poland, triggering power outages that result in
hospital patients dying or knocking out traffic lights, causing fatal
road accidents involving U.S. troops deployed there.

\"The West may have wanted strategic ambiguity in this area, and that
may still be the right choice,\" he added.

\"But [have we sufficiently made clear to the Russians the red lines on
cyber]{.underline} or frankly to the NATO public, the American public,
on red lines on cyber[? I don\'t think we\'ve done that.\"]{.underline}

Warner said he was \"[pleasantly surprised\" a massive Russian
cyberattack had not occurred.]{.underline} But he added that such an
[attack \"becomes even more dangerous with Putin elevating the readiness
of his nuclear weapons.\"]{.underline}

[Satellite networks are also **vulnerable to cyber

threats and attacks committed by unlawful and/or politically motivated
terrorist groups who **target critical communications** systems such as
satellite networks]{.underline} to cause [data corruption, disruption of

dangers**]{.underline} (i.e., being hit and/or damaged by stray objects
such as meteorites or other satellites[) **remain rare**, satellite
systems are remarkably **vulnerable to a range of cybersecurity issues**
and hostile attacks because they are hugely complex and expensive, take
months to deploy, and the primary emphasis is on getting a working
system that meets specification and the contract
deliverables]{.underline}. Most [cyber exploit attacks **take advantage
of incomplete code**]{.underline} that does not boundary check incoming
data allowing for stack buffer overflow attacks. These are very
prominent in embedded C and C++ systems and require an additional
vulnerability assessment exercise, [at **great cost and time**, in order
to fully secure a system.]{.underline} In these cases an [internal
buffer may be overrun by an intentionally 'malformed' packet and code
execution achieved by **overwriting the area of memory**]{.underline}
where the return address resides. Once basic code execution is achieved,
[new threads and processes may be started and most, if not **all,

#### No kinetic attacks -- hacking is cheaper, harder to attribute, can be easily scaled across targets, and are reversible -- infinitely more strategic. 

**Waterman '21** (Shaun Waterman, award-winning journalist and
communicator who has worked for the BBC, United Press International and
POLITICO, and an expert on cybersecurity and counter-terrorism who has
presented at leading conferences like Hacker Halted and the Aspen
Security Forum. "Hacking the Space Force" 07/22/21
<https://www.airforcemag.com/article/hacking-the-space-force/>)

And that's not a moment too soon: Unclassified threat assessments show
that vital U.S. space assets are increasingly vulnerable to a range of
emerging threats. However, [hacking is a much lower-cost way of
interfering with a satellite than kinetic or directed-energy attacks,
and can more easily be scaled across multiple targets,]{.underline}
according to the Aerospace Corp. [And because many cyberattacks are
reversible and can be hard to attribute, they offer an adversary a much
greater opportunity to hide their hand---or at least preserve some
plausible deniability---]{.underline}said Craig Miller, president of
government systems at Viasat Inc., which provides satellite hardware and
services to DOD.

"Someone can launch a cyber attack, and there're ways to obscure it and
obfuscate it, so that it's difficult to find the source. ... And they're
also often reversible, you can turn them off, or you can stop them,
whereas other effects \[like kinetic or directed-energy attacks\] cause
permanent damage, and it's much clearer who did it," he said. 

[The low cost character of these attacks makes it a matter of when---not
if---they'll be employed, Miller said]{.underline}. "The
non­attributable, nondestructive nature of cyber makes it far more likely
that it'll actually be employed. And that's the real danger of cyber
attacks---you're going to see them."

Satellites are vulnerable, noted Miller, because they remain operational
for decades. "Some of this hardware has been in space for 20 years. And
it's '90s vintage hardware with '90s vintage security and, in some
cases, '90s vintage operating systems that are very vulnerable."

### 2AC -- No Kinetic -- Russia

There is [little question that Russia will jam and/or spoof GPS

after GPS has become]{.underline} almost [ubiquitous as a first military
move]{.underline} since the conflict in Kosovo.

But US government officials, former officials and outside experts are
divided on how worried the US government ought to be about attacks aside

an act of aggression and an act of war.]{.underline}

Attacks on ISR sats: will they or won't they? 

The Russian military has routinely jammed GPS in Eastern Ukraine since
the Crimean conflict in 2014, according to experts inside and outside
the US government, and often spoofs GPS simply to disguise President
Vladimir Putin's movements around Moscow.

"We've seen lots of evidence of non-destructive counterspace
capabilities being used by Russia in both Eastern Ukraine and Syria
since 2014 and there's a lot of evidence that these capabilities are
fully integrated into their units at the doctrinal and operational
level," said Brian Weeden of Secure World Foundation (SWF). "So, I
definitely expect ubiquitous use of jamming, spoofing, and cyber attacks
against services like the civil GPS signals and satellite communications
if Russia opens a new front in Ukraine."

That evidence --- as well as a wealth of information about Russia's
effort to develop destructive anti-satellite technology --- is publicly
documented in SWF's 2021 annual [Global Counterspace
Capabilities](https://swfound.org/counterspace/) report, as well as the
sister report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies
(CSIS) called [Space Threat Assessment
2021](https://www.csis.org/analysis/space-threat-assessment-2021).

Russia's calculus on other types of satellites, however, is an open
question. In particular[, the fact that Ukraine is reliant on outside
sources, including the US, for imagery about Russian troop movements
raises the possibility that Russian military commanders might see those
satellites as targets.]{.underline}

"Even though \[America is\] not directly involved in the conflict in
other domains, we will be in space, because we're likely going to be
providing real time tactical intelligence from our space based assets to
the Ukrainian forces. And that makes our space assets a target for the
Russians," CSIS's Todd Harrison said.

Such attacks will be more likely if Russian forces find themselves in
trouble in Ukraine, he said, "because Ukrainians are acting on really
good intelligence about where the Russians are." Thus, "Russia might try
to cut that off" using "laser dazzling" to blind satellite cameras "or
even maybe even a kinetic ASAT weapon."

However, [several other experts said the odds on Moscow directly
targeting US government spy or missile warning satellites are low
because Putin does not want the US or its allies to become involved in
Ukraine. An attack on those ISR satellites, especially using a
destructive ASAT such as the one [Russia tested on Nov.
15](https://breakingdefense.com/2021/11/suspected-russian-ground-launched-asat-test-scatters-dangerous-debris-through-leo/),
would almost certainly guarantee a US response.]{.underline}

"[I doubt that the Russians would do anything in space]{.underline}. The
US and their allies have made it clear they have no desire or intention
to become embroiled in the actual conflict although they are certainly
ready with sanctions and to respond if needed[," Doug Loverro, former
head of Pentagon space policy, said]{.underline} in an email.

"It's easier to stay out of conflict when you have no direct attack on
US or NATO assets. And the [Russians do not want the US involved, so
they will likely **avoid any direct physical attack** on US
assets]{.underline}."

Weeden agreed, saying "It's extremely unlikely that Russia would
escalate that to destructive attacks against US or NATO satellites. We
have never seen those kinds of counterspace attacks used in warfare to
date and it would almost certainly draw the US and NATO into the
conflict, something Russia desperately doesn't want to happen."

On the other hand, Loverro said that jamming and cyber attacks are not
just possible but likely --- noting that the Law of Armed Conflict
(LOAC) clearly sets out that any satellites being used by Ukraine, no
matter who owns those satellites, are fair game.

"[The likelihood of jamming is quite high (as are cyber-attacks) because
under anyone's interpretation of the LOAC, any communication/information
systems being used by the Ukrainians are legitimate targets, even if the
other end belong to the US or NATO," Loverro said.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- NC3 Key

#### [Cybersecurity in space]{.underline} is the largest threat to NC3 integrity \-\-- US [collaboration with NATO allies]{.underline} to develop new measures now is key.

Dr. Jared **Dunnmon 17**, postdoctoral fellow in the Computer Science
Department at Stanford, 2017, "Nuclear Command and Control in the
Twenty-First Century: Maintaining Surety in Outer Space and Cyberspace",
https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/resrep23162.5.pdf \\\\SYang

[While **rapid advances in information tech**nology, communications, and
computation have yielded many improvements to NC3 systems, these
improvements have come at the cost of **NC3 surety and security**. The
two domains in which these costs are most apparent are the two newest
arenas of conflict: outer space and cyberspace. In the words of Admiral
Haney, "the space domain, along with cyberspace, is simultaneously more
critical to all U.S. operations yet more vulnerable than ever to hostile
actions."14 The worrisome combination of international norms that have
been far outpaced by the speed of technological advancement and
democratization of key space and cyber technologies has led the United
States to a point where it is difficult to be confident that the current
NC3 structure is resilient in a cyber-physical sense.]{.underline} Outer
Space [The major threat to NC3 posed by vulnerabilities in space-based
assets results from potential disruptions to both early warning and
communications functions.]{.underline} As noted by Frank Rose, former
deputy assistant secretary of state for defense policy and verification
operations, [The **U**nited **S**tates in particular is **deeply
reliant** up**on** space.]{.underline} While such reliance enables the
United States and our allies and partners to undertake a range of
operations in support of peace and security, this reliance has
increasingly been viewed by potential adversaries as a vulnerability to
be exploited through the development of counterspace capabilities. [This
reality is particularly emergent in the context of NC3. At present, it
is known that **Russia and China** are actively pursuing or already
maintain such capabilities as laser weapons for satellite denial,
electromagnetic (EM) jamming for communications degradation, and
physical antisatellite (ASAT) systems.]{.underline} Given heavy reliance
on satellites such as Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) and Air
Force Satellite Communications (AFSATCOM) in the NC3 system, ensuring
both reliability and resiliency to these types of threats will be
critical to creating a flexible and efficient NC3 system. Cyberspace [In
the cyber domain, potential **vulnerabilities exist** in all three parts
of the **c**ommand, **c**ontrol, and **c**ommunications triad.
Specifically, due to cyberspace's relatively low cost of entry, cyber
threats range from state-sponsored offensive military operations and
espionage activities, to \[violent extremist organizations\] intent on
disrupting our way of life, to cyber criminals and recreational hackers
seeking financial gain and notoriety.]{.underline} Additionally, the
U.S. supply chain and critical infrastructure remains vulnerable to
cyber attack, and even as we detect and defeat attacks, attribution
remains a significant challenge. At present, assumptions are that NC3 is
secured via a combination of air gaps, technological superiority in
outer space and cyberspace, and human intervention in the control loop.
Unfortunately, this is not always the case. [In the intercontinental
ballistic missile (ICBM) program, for instance, **documented
vulnerabilities** include **potential entry into the firewalled NC3
system**]{.underline}, phony orders being conveyed via a backup antenna,
distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on the nuclear
infrastructure, and even a direct attack on thousands of feet of cable
of the Hardened Intersite Cable System. For the strategic ballistic
missile submarine (SSBN) component, it has been widely publicized that
the United States has chosen to use Linux-based operating systems in its
SSBNs, as opposed to Windows XP-based architectures currently used by
the British Trident program. While neither of these operating systems is
inherently problematic, the fact that their use in specific functional
domains has been published so widely will enable hackers to focus on the
correct class of exploits to use against these systems. This
observation, furthermore, hints at a distressing reality: with the
emergence of ubiquitous cyber threats, the U.S. acquisition process has
already begun moving toward increased levels of security and
classification across the Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise, which
hinders efficiency at all levels of the acquisition process. Without
firing a shot, the opponent may well have caused substantial cost to the
United States already due to the inefficiency resultant from broadly
increased data security and classification procedures. With the bomber
airborne component of the command, control, and communications triad,
the Air Force has experienced several NC3 breakdowns in the past several
decades, the most recent of which involved the inadvertent placement of
several nuclear warheads in a strategic bomber that flew over the United
States. While this latter situation was not necessarily a cyber failure
of commission, it is certainly one of omission in the sense that
appropriate command and control safeguards were not in place to prevent
such a mistake from occurring. Critical infrastructure that either
directly or indirectly supports the nuclear enterprise, such as the
domestic power grid is also vulnerable to cyber attack. Janet
Napolitano, former secretary of homeland security, recently estimated
that an adversary could disable one of the major U.S. power grids with
80 to 90 percent probability of success. The frequency of such cyber
vulnerabilities generally correlates with the size of the codebase---one
can usually assume one error per thousand lines of code. For
perspective, a generic Linux operating system had 15 million lines of
code as of 2011. Thus, while the National Nuclear Security
Administration (NNSA) currently deploys a wide variety of cyber-defense
techniques in defense of nuclear assets, including vulnerability
scanning, firewalls, commercial antivirus systems, encryption, data loss
prevention, data at rest security, network monitoring, enterprise
forensics, and automated security control assessment, it is impractical
to find every possible vulnerability in a large codebase and thus
impossible to guarantee absolute security from zero-day
exploits.2Further, post-detection attribution remains a challenge that
usually takes weeks to sort out, meaning that attribution may be
unachievable on timescales characteristic of a crisis. [Many of the most
daunting challenges for NC3 resilience lie at the **intersection of
cyberspace and outer space** domains, where cyber attacks are directed
at space-based NC3 assets. A recent study revealed substantial numbers
of exploitable flaws in many widely used commercial satellite
architectures, including the Iridium constellation, International
Maritime Satellites (INMARSAT), and other satellites commonly used by
both North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces and critical
infrastructure systems.]{.underline} Key vulnerability categories
included hard-coded credentials (undocumented credentials that can
authenticate in documented interfaces), undocumented protocols
(protocols not intended for end users), insecure protocols (end-user
protocols that pose a security risk), and backdoors (mechanisms used to
access features not intended for end users). [Outcomes from reported
exploits included control over systems as varied as land-based
communication and aircraft navigation, either of which could have a
debilitating effect on MEECN integrity and ultimate NC3 efficacy.
Understanding and mitigating the potential effects of these cyber
threats to space-based assets will be imperative in ensuring the
continued effectiveness of NC3.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Yes Russia Attack

#### Russia has capability to destroy NATO satellites and GPS -- already hacked Ukraine.

**Ayres '22** (Thomas Ayres, retired U.S. Army major general, former
general counsel of the Department of the Air Force. "Russia's war could
spread to space; the U.S. should be prepared" 04/26/22
https://spacenews.com/op-ed-russias-war-could-spread-to-space-the-u-s-should-be-prepared/)

[As background, recall that in November 2021, while amassing forces on
Ukraine's borders, Russia launched an ASAT satellite missile that
destroyed one of its own satellites in orbit. It caused hazardous
orbital debris and at the time seemed senseless.]{.underline} Russian
authorities blathered and quibbled.

In hindsight, [Russia's demonstration of offensive space capabilities
was on their pre-invasion checklist.]{.underline} This preparatory step
to invading Ukraine [sent a dual warning. First, when Russia invades,
don't interfere with Russian space systems upon which the Russian
military relies. Second, if you seek to come to Ukraine's aid, U.S. and
NATO satellites upon which you rely will be in jeopardy.]{.underline}

Even earlier, Russia has been saber rattling in space. In February 2020,
Gen. John "Jay" Raymond, the chief of space operations of the U.S. Space
Force, reported that [a Russian inspector satellite had actively
maneuvered near a U.S. national security satellite]{.underline}. The
inspector satellite, as if from a Russian nesting doll, detached from
another satellite to purposefully approach and threaten the U.S.
satellite.  

This precursor message was also exceptionally clear[. The satellites on
which the data for the blue dot on your phone, nearly every global
financial transaction, and the effectiveness of military forces relies,
are not beyond Russian reach. ]{.underline}

Russia's provocations in space continue even while we cooperate on the
International Space Station (ISS). But the invasion has changed that
calculus as well. Upon the announcement of U.S. sanctions on the
aerospace industry, [the director of Roscosmos, the Russian Space
Agency, tweeted, "If you block cooperation with us, who will save the
International Space Stations (ISS) from an uncontrolled de-orbit and
fall into the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [or ...
Europe?" ]{.underline}

With American astronauts on board, [purposeful sabotage of the ISS would
certainly be an act of war]{.underline}. Looking for other avenues to
voice displeasure, Roscosmos looked at the commercial space industry.
They demanded the United Kingdom guarantee OneWeb's satellites, which
were to be launched on Russian Soyuz rockets, not be used for military
purposes. The United Kingdom demurred and SpaceX rockets have come to
OneWeb's rescue. 

Rather than passively awaiting further signals of Russian power in space
at a threshold below an act of war, the U.S. can and should take clear
measures to deter Russian aggressive action in space, in addition to the
recently announced self-imposed ASAT ban.  Failing to do so only invites
Russian attempts to harass, degrade or even mistakenly destroy U.S.
satellites. 

First, the intelligence community should remain focused on attributing
harmful or menacing Russian moves in space and reveal them. Just as the
U.S. published Russia's playbook on the ground prior to the invasion of
Ukraine, the U.S. should reveal every dangerous or unprofessional
movement of satellites near friendly satellites and thereby send our own
signals to deter Russian malign activity in Space

Second, the Biden administration must forcefully pronounce a redline in
space.  Even as SpaceX and Elon Musk helpfully delivered Starlink
terminals, [the U.S. must message that uninterrupted internet and
satellite communications for U.S. and NATO forces and allies in eastern
Europe is a national security asset. If our satellite network is
attacked in any manner, it will be considered an act of
war.  ]{.underline}

## 2AC -- Solvency

### 2AC -- Solvency -- Post Strat Con

#### **Cooperating over space-based cybersecurity including at least clarifying Article 5 solves.**

Rose **Gottemoeller 6-26**; Department of Social Sciences, United States
Military Academy; Defence Studies, June 26, 2022; "Engaging with emerged
and emerging domains: cyber, space, and technology in the 2022 NATO
strategic concept," https://doi.org/10.1080/14702436.2022.2082955

NATO's ability to achieve its core tasks of Collective Defense, Crisis
Management, and Cooperative Security requires strength and resilience of
each member state. It is critical to build a common strategic culture
among Allies that embraces the technological complexity of these new
domains and seeks to address the challenges of the strategic
environment. While member states will continue to have differential
capabilities within each domain, the culture among Allies must reflect a
desire to maintain a competitive edge by growing human capital and
technological development. Political elites of member states must also
understand how this technological complexity may shape their decision
making and their understanding of escalatory pathways (Kubiak and Mishra
2022). NATO must foster a culture of adaptability and flexibility to
handle the everchanging nature of cyber, space, and EDT. Consensus,
communication, and cooperation, described below, serve as the
foundational pillars upon which a resilient and adaptable Alliance
grows.

Consensus

Consensus is at the heart of the Alliance. To properly integrate cyber
and space domains into the Strategic Concept, [Allies should seek
internal consensus on three topics: 1) the threshold of cyberattack or
space action upon which Allies can invoke Article 5]{.underline} 2)
actions short-of-war that must addressed by steady-state defense
operations or that require a collective Allied response [3) actions that
NATO will proactively take in these domains to ensure adequate defense
in cyberspace.]{.underline}

First, [although the Comprehensive Cyber Defense Policy acknowledges
that Allies may invoke Article 5 after experiencing a cyberattack, **it
is not clear** what threshold of cyberattack constitutes a violation of
Article 5. This must be explored further by the Allies to reduce delay
in consensus in the event of a cyberattack.]{.underline} Second, Allies
must also seek to understand what cyber operations place NATO's core
tasks of Collective Defense, Crisis Management, and Cooperative Security
at risk. Cyber operations, such as espionage and cyber-enabled
information operations, are often used to subvert and erode state power
outside periods of conventional conflict. The 2010 NATO Strategic
Concept narrowly scopes defense and deterrence to cyber attacks;
however, it is precisely cyber operations short-of-force that require
thoughtful consideration to integrate within the forthcoming NATO
Strategic Concept. Cyber operations create and amplify crises, eroding
the "territorial integrity, political independence and security of its
members" (NATO 2010, 9). This is best illustrated with numerous attempts
to sow division through election interference (Sarts 2017). [Cyber
operations undermine the collective nature of defense by exploiting
democratic society and wedge driving among NATO states.]{.underline} The
[democratic nature and open information environment of most Allies makes
the Alliance particularly vulnerable to cyber operations short-of-force.
Member states must reach consensus that cyber operations below the
threshold of war are still critical threats to the effectiveness of the
Alliance. This also **extends to actions in space that threaten the
essential tasks** of the Alliance but fall short of physical
destruction]{.underline} (Smith 2022).

While consensus is required among members to identify these thresholds,
the [Allies must also reach consensus on whether to reveal or conceal
these thresholds beyond the Alliance]{.underline}. NATO must ask if a
clearly declared threshold in cyber and space domains bolsters
deterrence or whether deterrence in these domains operates differently
than conventional armed conflict. One consideration that may inform this
discussion: Will adversaries test the limits to find a covert threshold
or does the strategic ambiguity provide a greater deterrent? If Allies
believe that a declared Article 5 threshold will be tested by
adversaries to challenge the credibility of the threshold, it may be
worth concealing. If [Allies believe that concealing an Article 5
threshold would increase probing attacks that test the limit of the
Alliance, it may be worth revealing.]{.underline} Regardless, an openly
declared threshold upon which member states can invoke Article 5 must
also overcome the limitations of the cyber domain that make deterrence
difficult. Moreso than armed attack, cyber operations continue to
generate significant uncertainty about intentions, and can be concealed
from the public due to their often-clandestine nature (Lonergan and
Lonergan 2022). Also, the timing associated with attribution could
reduce the salience of a response (Baliga et al 2020). These features of
the cyber domain may make deterrence by punishment less credible and may
make Article 5 invocation slow to realize. Therefore, [if NATO would
like to publicly declare a threshold to invoke Article 5 in cyber and
space, NATO must acknowledge these challenges to preserve the
credibility of the threshold. NATO must also over-communicate that,
across all domains, Article 5 must be invoked by an Ally and is not an
automatic escalation pathway.]{.underline}

Finally, Allies must seek consensus on how NATO uses cyber operations
short-offorce within the context of cyber defense. As offense-defense
distinguishability is muddled in cyberspace, Allies must decide whether
Defense and Deterrence is best advanced by in-network activity or
whether NATO will operate outside their network as a form of defensive
practice (Slayton 2017). There has been a large academic debate on the
efficacy of deterrence by punishment in cyberspace (Gartzke and Lindsay
2019; Nye 2017; Brantly 2018). Recently, [scholars have coalesced around
deterrence by denial as the most effective deterrent in
cyberspace]{.underline}. However, deterrence by denial is most
successful when states are willing to conduct counter-cyber operations.
Yet, these operations can be controversial for their offensive nature;
for example, the United States cyber doctrine of "Persistent Engagement"
and "Hunt Forward" utilize offensive means for defensive ends (Borghard
and Lonergan 2021). The Allies should seek consensus as to what
operational actions within the cyber domain best uphold Collective
Defense.

Communication

[Communication is central to properly integrating cyber and space into
the NATO Strategic Concept and contributes to the resilience of and
within the Alliance]{.underline}. Communication about cyber, space, and
EDT should purposefully occur with two audiences in mind: intra-Alliance
communication among member states and extraAlliance communication
intended for NATO's adversaries and partners.

Intra-Alliance communication must focus on three primary objectives: 1)
reducing technical barriers for political decision makers to facilitate
their response to rapidly evolving space and cyber development; 2)
creating common understanding among member states at varying degrees of
capabilities; 3) eliminating stove-piping of complex technologies. The
technical nature of these domains can intimidate or create high barriers
to entry for political decision makers. Decision makers must be able to
understand crises to manage them. NATO must seek to integrate experts
who can serve as the translators between decision makers and technicians
in the field to facilitate consensus and development within cyber and
space domains. Intra-alliance communication and knowledge sharing can
also help overcome disparities among member states who have differential
capabilities. Additionally, intra-Alliance communication between
conventional domains and the cyber, space and EDT operational and policy
cells will further integrate these new domains into the fabric of the
Alliance.

Extra-Alliance communication must: 1) enhance credibility of deterrence
through clear, credible guarantees of punishment and communication of
NATO's capabilities (Lonergan and Montgomery 2022) and 2) collectively
attribute perpetrators and disclose discovered vulnerabilities to
improve the resilience of these domains. Deterrence relies on a clear
understanding of cost--benefit analysis (Lindsay and Gartzke 2018).
[NATO must clearly communicate their capabilities and the range of
potential consequences so adversaries understand the costly nature of
attempting to overcome NATO's defensive capabilities and the high costs
by way of punishment should they succeed. Communication strategies
should emphasize the resolve of NATO in addressing cyber, space, and EDT
threats and, most essentially, the political will to respond to a cyber
or space attack.]{.underline} These external communication strategies
harden the deterrent by bolstering credibility of a response without
tying their hands to a specific response. Moreover, communication
through public attribution, as was illustrated in the 2020 Microsoft
Exchange Hack (Connolly 2021), demonstrates consensus about the identity
of the perpetrator and increases costs for cyber adversaries (Egloff
2020; Egloff and Smeets 2021; Hedgecock 2021). Taken together,
intra-Alliance communication improves the resilience of the Alliance and
enhances Cooperative Security and Crisis Management. While
extra-Alliance communication serves to bolster the Collective Defense.

Cooperation

[The cyber and space domains have often been interpreted as public
commons. As a result, these commons are difficult to govern and serve as
the intersection of public and private actors. NATO must seek to lead
cooperation within the Alliance]{.underline}, across partnership states,
and with private actors [to maintain a scientific edge]{.underline}
(Rugolo and Monic 2022). NATO currently supports the Industry Cyber
Partnership to improve Allies' network security and increase resilience.
This industry partnership must be replicated in a NATO Industry Emerging
Technology Partnership, to facilitate a competitive edge in capabilities
that are on the horizon or not fully realized in the operational
security environment. The agreement to establish Defense Innovation
Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA) for civil-military
cooperation at the 2021 Brussels Summit, is a step in the right
direction. Once established, cooperation must also be facilitated across
partnership hubs within NATO to prevent stove piping of innovation.
Additionally, it is critical that these innovation centers encourage
partnerships across the entire spectrum of private industry, from
startups and garage innovators to large scale private corporations with
extensive scale research and development (Kosal 2022). Finally,
[intra-Alliance cooperation requires intelligence sharing and capability
development among member states to ensure that the Alliance continues to
meet the challenges of the strategic environment.]{.underline} One
example of intra-Alliance cooperation that compliments NATO's efforts is
the European Union's initiatives to bolster cybersecurity. The European
Union Agency for [Cybersecurity's efforts to improve capacity,
cooperation, and a whole-of-society approach to cybersecurity ultimately
bolster NATO's deterrence by denial by hardening the attack surface of
Europe.]{.underline}

Recommendations

In keeping with the current NATO essential core tasks- Collective
Defense, Crisis Management, Cooperative Security- and the structure of
the existing Strategic Concept, we submit several recommendations for
consideration in 2022 NATO Strategic Concept: In discussions of the
Security Environment within the forthcoming Strategic Concept, [NATO
must enhance the discussion of cyber, space, and EDT]{.underline}. We
recommend that NATO change the language from "cyber attack" to "cyber
operation" to capture the wide spectrum of activities that subvert and
erode state power including cyber espionage and cyber-enable information
operations In discussions of the [Collective Defense, we recommend that
NATO address how the **space** domain fits within the context of defense
and **deterrence**, while also acknowledging the **critical role that
space plays in maintaining communications and interoperability** among
Allies.]{.underline} NATO must also incorporate public attribution of
cyber operations as a political and strategic tool that can bolster the
collective defense and cooperative security of member states. [We
recommend that NATO reach consensus on a threshold that constitutes an
"attack against all" in the cyber and space domain. Allies must also
decide whether to **only communicate** the **existence of the threshold
or** to **publicly reveal the threshold** upon which a member may invoke
Article 5.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- AT: Alt Cause

#### The plan solves US exceptionalism in space and overcomes alt causes

Department at the Naval Postgraduate School, October 2011, "Coalition
Building in Space: Where Networks are Power,"
<https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a555238.pdf>

[Despite]{.underline} the [advantages of creating]{.underline} such [an
allied network for space]{.underline}, it must be admitted that [a
number of current obstacles exist to such efforts. Traditional U.S.
thinking about U.S. exceptionalism in space would have to be revised and
a more egalitarian view of alliance partners adopted]{.underline}. The
U.S. [State and Defense]{.underline} Departments [would need to engage
in ITAR reform and craft new military-to-military
agreements]{.underline} (of the type the U.S. has with Australia) [to
allow]{.underline} the [sharing]{.underline} of [space **info**rmation.
In Congress, a new political willingness to fund]{.underline} space
[systems]{.underline} that would [not be solely for national
benefit]{.underline} or under purely national control [would need to
emerge]{.underline}. At the technical level, [new integration with
allied industry would]{.underline} likely [be necessary to create common
standards and interfaces]{.underline}, which would initially cost time
and money. Still, [given the emerging risks in space]{.underline} of
[and]{.underline} the possible [benefits to be achieved by joint
efforts, these problems **do not seem insurmountable**]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- AT: Norms Fail

#### Norms are key to [crisis stability]{.underline} -- building them [in advance]{.underline} is [goldilocks]{.underline} for deterrence and [signaling]{.underline} escalation thresholds

[Militaries]{.underline} stand to [gain additional unique advantages
from widespread adherence to **operational**]{.underline}
[space]{.underline} **[norms]{.underline}**. [Norms]{.underline} can
serve to **[highlight abnormal behavior]{.underline}**, [enabling
warning of and protection against space threats]{.underline}.
Militaries, therefore, should support domestic and international
initiatives to shape operational norms of behavior, and they should lend
their expertise to norm development efforts. As international space
norms take shape, militaries can then analyze abnormal behavior,
characterizing those specific behaviors they would consider hostile or
aggressive and determining how to respond appropriately in different
situations. Militaries may also need to consider whether to evolve
operational policies and practices to meet behavioral expectations.

Norms are not a panacea for constraining aggressive, hostile,
provocative, or otherwise deliberately irresponsible behavior in outer
space. Norms may be enough to dissuade a rational actor from routinely
engaging in irresponsible acts, but they will not prevent a committed
aggressor from deliberately disrupting or denying space services it
deems detrimental to its interests. Norms, however, can play a critical
role in detecting and responding to potential threats.

Norms enable early detection of potentially hostile actions or
intentions in space. If a satellite exhibits behaviors contrary to
operational norms, this is a clear flag to monitor its activities more
closely. In times of peace, such activities are likely to be nothing
more than an anomaly, which may deserve increased monitoring to preserve
spaceflight safety or to mitigate harmful electromagnetic interference.
[In periods of heightened tensions, norms can form the basis of criteria
for early indications and **warning** of potentially **aggressive
actions**.]{.underline}

[To have maximum value]{.underline} in identifying "abnormal" behavior,
[norms should be **widely accepted**]{.underline}, [such as through
voluntary guidelines or international standards]{.underline}. Short of
explicit international acceptance, national or allied declaratory
policies can communicate those behaviors considered to be a
demonstration of hostile intent, shaping tacit understanding of
acceptable and unacceptable behaviors. [If these agreements and/or
communications are clear, and norms are generally
**observed**]{.underline} in times of peace, [then we can assume in
times of crisis that behavior contrary to norms is most likely a
**deliberate choice**]{.underline}. [These assumptions will be a
critical input to **crisis decisionmaking**]{.underline} [and, by
extension, may have a significant effect on **crisis
stability.**]{.underline} [Both an **under-reaction** and
**over-reaction** to anomalous behaviors could have **serious** and
**unintended consequences**]{.underline} for international peace and
security.

To the extent that the international community can observe what is
happening in space, norms will shape world opinion about these
behaviors, branding them as simply irresponsible or something more
egregious such as potentially unlawful. This will require, at a minimum,
compelling evidence based on space situational awareness information
from a trusted source. Confirmation from multiple, independent,
international, and/or commercial sources of space situational awareness
will have a positive and reinforcing effect on detecting bad behavior in
outer space. Nations may condemn those who choose to engage in behavior
contrary to norms. Condemnation, however, is a double-edged sword; a
nation cannot take others to task for violating international norms and
simultaneously seek to operate with impunity. At first glance, military
space operators may bristle at the implication that norms may constrain
their freedom of action in space. Militaries, though, already accept
legally binding constraints in all domains. For example, fundamental to
the conduct of modern warfare is international humanitarian law (also
known as the Law of War or the Law of Armed Conflict),2 which seeks to
limit the effects of conflict, especially on noncombatants. Militaries
around the world translate international humanitarian law into rules of
engagement that guide servicemembers. A future space norms regime could
be fashioned similarly to other regimes that govern activities in shared
spaces and allow for differences in the application of rules to
government or military actors and private actors. For example, Article 3
of the Convention on International Civil Aviation provides that the
Convention does not apply to "state" aircraft, though such aircraft are
required to exercise due regard for the safety of navigation of civil
aviation.3 Article 48 of the Constitution of the International
Telecommunication Union likewise provides freedom for military radio
installations, but requires them, so far as possible, to observe
provisions to prevent harmful interference.4 As in these other domains,
safety and sustainability focused space norms, while remaining good and
responsible practice no matter the situation, need not be strictly
adhered to by militaries at all times. Even if militaries are not
expressly required to follow norms, they nonetheless should be prepared
to make more deliberate behavioral choices because of how actions
inconsistent with norms will be interpreted. This not only requires a
strategic and holistic perspective on national security space behaviors,
especially in periods of crisis, but also creates opportunities for
deliberate signaling. Just as increasing airborne reconnaissance or
forward-deploying aircraft carriers can demonstrate interest and stake,
so too can maneuvering satellites demonstrate readiness and resolve.
Ensuring that the desired signals are received requires significant
communication and/or agreement on norms of behavior well in advance of a
crisis. Norms also provide clarity to acquirers, operators, and
decisionmakers. Similar to how the Department of Defense (DOD) reviews
all new weapons systems to ensure they can be operated in accordance
with international law, acquirers and operators could look to space
norms for guidance on what capabilities and actions would be permissible
and under what circumstances. This ensures resources are not expended on
systems that political leaders will not employ and provides guidance for
operational planners on how to protect and defend space systems in a
manner that will be deemed acceptable in different situations.

[Norms]{.underline}---[or rather the]{.underline} **[violation
thereof]{.underline}**---[also enable the creation of
**thresholds**]{.underline}, [triggers,]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[rules of engagement]{.underline}** [that allow militaries to employ
passive or active measures to protect threatened space
**systems**]{.underline}. [Norms]{.underline},
**[ironically]{.underline}**, [may enhance freedom of action when it is
**needed most**]{.underline}. [Because norms support the development of
criteria for **judging hostile acts** or hostile intent in space, they
**enable** actions to be taken in **self-defense**.]{.underline}

#### Clarifying [escalation thresholds]{.underline} in [advance]{.underline} is key to preventing [miscalc]{.underline} in a crisis -- lack of [cold war experience]{.underline} in [space]{.underline} makes preemptive norms [essential]{.underline}

Simply [put, the weapon, target, and context all contribute to the
perceived intent and effects of a counterspace attack.]{.underline}
Unlike in other domains, **[tremendous ambiguity]{.underline}** [exists
regarding the use of counterspace weapons]{.underline}. This means that
[all of these variables would be **open to interpretation in
crises**]{.underline}, [and it should be remembered that an inherent
characteristic of crises is a **short timeframe**]{.underline} [for
decisionmaking. When time is **short** and the potential cost of
inaction is **significant**]{.underline}, or even catastrophic,
[decisionmakers tend to lean toward **worst-case
interpretations**]{.underline} [of an adversary's actions. This is a
clear recipe for inadvertent **miscalc**ulation.]{.underline}

Bringing Space Down to Earth

[The Cold War adversaries had many years to develop **mutual
understandings**]{.underline} [about the nature and role of nuclear
weapons, and these understandings contributed to strategic
**stability**]{.underline}. [These understandings were born out of
**realworld crises**]{.underline}, such as the Berlin crises, Korean
War, and Cuban missile crisis. They also emerged from dialogues, such as
formal summits and long-running arms control negotiations. The former
are certainly much more dangerous than the latter, and no one wants to
see the space equivalent of a Cuban missile crisis.

[There are signs of progress]{.underline}. The United Nations Group of
Government Experts recently recommended bilateral and multilateral
transparency and confidence-building measures. In addition, the European
Union is leading open-ended consultations to develop an "International
Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities." [While these measures will
help promote the responsible use of space, they do not **squarely
address** the current]{.underline} [lack of **mutual
understanding**]{.underline} [regarding how space attacks will be
perceived in the **midst of a crisis.**]{.underline} [This is of
**particular concern**]{.underline} [for the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline}
**[China]{.underline}**, which, as previously noted, increasingly rely
on space systems to execute their political and military strategies.

At the government-to-government (so-called Track 1) level, there is not
currently a productive venue for the United States and China to develop
a mutual understanding of how space plays into crisis stability. While
space security has been incorporated into existing diplomatic and
defense dialogues, these steps in the right direction have been slow and
tentative, and there is much work to be done.

[Recently, some engagements led by think tanks]{.underline} (known as
Track 1.5 dialogues due to mixed delegations of government and
academics) [have begun to explore the issue, and it is clear that both
sides harbor a lot of **mistrust**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[misperception]{.underline}**. The United States continues to raise
questions about China's military modernization and its potential
coercion of regional neighbors over contested territory. China continues
to question the implications of expanding U.S. missile defenses and, to
a lesser extent, the U.S. rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region.

[Suspicions]{.underline} about space activities [fit within this broader
**geopolitical mistrust**]{.underline}. The United States continues to
express concern about Chinese space activities and China's lack of
transparency when it comes to unique space launch profiles or robotics
experiments. China, for its part, expresses concerns about U.S.
activities, such as the reusable experimental test platform known as the
X-37B. [These misperceptions are **hard to resolve**]{.underline}, [both
because of the inherent dual-use nature of space systems and the
difficulty in creating transparency for a regime so far removed from
terra firma. Resolving such suspicions and building trust take **time**
and require a common understanding of the nature of the **space domain**
and **space systems**.]{.underline}

Returning to the formulation of Colby, recall that "[in a stable
situation]{.underline} . . . **[major war]{.underline}** [would only
come about because one party **truly sought it,**]{.underline} not
because of miscalculation." [Miscalculation is **best
avoided**]{.underline} [when each side understands the implications of
its **actions** and **understands**]{.underline} [how the other side
will interpret and react to those actions]{.underline}. This situation
does not exist in today's environment regarding space systems and space
weapons. We lack a common understanding of how space will contribute to,
or come to define, potential crises between the United States and China.
As both countries seek to define a "new type of great power
relationship," it would be wise to consider how new technologies and
operational concepts are best managed during crises. Given both sides'
growing reliance on space systems to achieve their future military and
political aims, a lack of understanding comes with great peril. [We
should strive to build a **common framework now**]{.underline}, [using
dialogues during peacetime, before provocative actions in space during a
**crisis imperil stability** here **on Earth.**]{.underline}

[**India** became the fourth country to demonstrate a

precursor to an eventual Space Force. In China, the Strategic Support
Force, established in 2015, has an important role in further developing
the PLA's space warfare capabilities. Russia, building on the vast
infrastructure established during Soviet times, remains an important
space power.

[In strictly **military terms**, Europe's space powers **lag** behind

datalinks, and further development of ASAT missile systems, satellite
jammers and directed energy weapons.15 China has embarked on a manned
programme seeking to establish a research station on the Moon in the
mid-2020s and to post humans there for extended periods in the 2030s.16
The US also intends to return to the Moon; the first unmanned mission to
transport cargo is planned for 2021, to be followed by a manned mission
in 2024.17

Meanwhile, billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson have
each launched their own space corporations, based on grand visions of
space exploration, exploitation and colonisation. At the same time, the
US government is redrafting its rules and regulations, no longer
designating space as a 'global commons' but clearly pursuing the
objective to 'unshackle business activity in space'.18 If history is any

Implications for NATO

The literature on revolutions in military affairs (RMAs) suggests that
those who manage to harness and exploit new technologies, combine them
with novel operational and organisational concepts and evolve a new way
of war stand to gain significantly -- a sobering insight in this era of
strategic competition. This is not lost on, for instance, Putin, who
highlighted the impact of AI on the international order when he observed
that 'artificial intelligence is the future,...whoever becomes the
leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world'.19 Chinese
leaders have expressed similar views.20

Whether the technological trends described above signal the advent of
another RMA or merely represent incremental change remains subject to
debate.21 Regardless, the implications of the technological progress
summarised here are already being made manifest and are likely to
progressively materialise during the 2020s. The first attacks with
swarms of drones have already taken place in Syria, Libya and Saudi
Arabia, executed not by a state but by various non-state actors.

NATO members already face an assortment of challenges, including the
vicious conflict dynamics in Northern Africa, the Middle East and
Southwest Asia, which are not likely to disappear soon. Further,
Russia's nuclear and conventional modernisation, in combination with its
antiaccess/ area denial (A2/AD) capabilities, has cast doubt on the
credibility of NATO's conventional and nuclear deterrence posture.22 In
this latter context, it has become painfully clear that the armed forces
of European NATO members, in particular, have neglected the demands of
joint highintensity warfare at their own peril. For NATO, these
developments therefore suggest, at a minimum, a strong imperative to not
only rebuild its capabilities, but also to keep pace with rapid
technological advances.

NATO Initiatives

In recent years, NATO launched a series of initiatives to regain
capabilities and expertise, with member states pledging to increase
defence spending. Current capability improvement plans focus on
enhancing readiness, regaining lost capabilities in artillery, tanks,
transport and C2 assets; and introducing fifthgeneration jet fighters in
greater numbers than those ordered prior to 2014. Cyber capabilities are
also receiving a boost now that cyberspace has been designated a
warfighting domain. The Alliance will enhance missile defence in the
next decade by fielding state-of-the-art US radar systems in various
Eastern European member states. Furthermore, NATO has formulated a
roadmap for research on emerging technologies such as AI, quantum
computing, autonomy and hypersonic missiles. Various organisations, such
as NATO's Science and Technology Organization (STO) and different
centres of excellence, aim to support knowledge diffusion, create
awareness and stimulate research and development. The STO conducts
research on more than 250 projects across seven domains that canvass a
wide spectrum of emerging technologies.23

European NATO member states that are also EU members have similarly
agreed on a series of capability improvement initiatives. Following the
2016 EU Global Strategy, the EU launched the Coordinated Annual Review
on Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the
European Defence Fund (EDF). These initiatives focus on the range of
capability targets identified in the 2018 update to the EU Capability
Development Plan. The goals are to achieve a measure of strategic
autonomy and to create a coherent full-spectrum force package. This
force package aims to ensure air and information superiority and access
to space-based systems; to support cyber response operations, naval
manoeuvrability and air mobility; and finally, and more generically, to
develop 'innovative technologies for enhanced future military
capabilities'.24 The US, meanwhile, has announced its determination to
leverage the potential of emerging technologies in what has been
labelled the 'Third Offset'. In parallel with this initiative, the US is
exploring a new operational concept -- 'Multi-Domain Operations' -- that
harnesses and exploits these new capabilities and may play the same role
as the AirLand Battle concept of the 1980s.25

Challenges

Despite these efforts, the [developments]{.underline} sketched in this
chapter [present **NATO** members with an assortment of financial,
ethical and military **strategic challenges**]{.underline}. For NATO's
European member states in particular, the Third Offset poses a
considerable financial burden.26 Although European member states
currently spend \$264 billion collectively on defence, and despite a
decade of improvement initiatives, the capability shortfalls that came
to light in Operation Allied Force in Kosovo in 1999 persist.27 In 2012,
one study concluded that without US contributions, Europe would struggle
to conduct a so-called 'Small Joint Operation, Air- Heavy' -- an
operation comparable to Operation Allied Force or Unified Protector in
Libya (2011).28 In 2020, European armed forces remain critically
dependent on the US for C4ISR and suppression of enemy air defences
(SEAD) capabilities, cruise missiles, ballistic missile defence, stealth
aircraft and electronic warfare assets. The same applies to creating and
manning effective operational headquarters that rely on state-of-theart
C2 technology as well as expertise in operational-level planning and
commanding joint operations. Estimates indicate that without the US, the
defence of the Baltic states and Poland would require an additional
investment by European states of about \$288−357 billion.29

Adapting to the new geopolitical environment and implementing capability
improvements for their armed forces has proven difficult for Europe's
defence organisations, however, not least because of budgetary
realities.30 Defence cooperation initiatives also suffer because
European defence industries remain fractured and compartmentalised along
national lines, and have a diminishing ability to nationally develop and
manufacture complex leading-edge military capabilities. Remedying
several of the capability shortfalls -- those pertaining to large and
complex systems such as tanker aircraft or electronic warfare platforms
-- also exceeds the requirements of individual countries and calls for
collective action. In addition, actually fielding the necessary new
capabilities takes at least a decade.31 Finally, while high-end weapon
systems and emerging technologies claim much of the Alliance's
attention, funds will also be needed for restoring more mundane
capabilities such as ammunition stockpiles and transport capacity, which
will enable rapid reinforcement and a sustained military campaign. Given
the rather dismal European track record in actually achieving military
transformation as envisioned by NATO, investments in Third Offset
technologies may never actually materialise and might not produce the
necessary improvements even if they did.32

Another challenge lies in the controversial nature of some of these
technologies. While the technologies may yield many military benefits,
the legality and ethics of, for instance, deploying unmanned and
semiautonomous weapon systems are hotly debated throughout society,
academia, parliaments and religious circles (including the Vatican).
Expert groups discuss the ethical and legal issues associated with
military AI, including in the context of the UN Convention on Certain
Conventional Weapons. António Guterres, former UN Secretary-General,
captured prevailing concerns when he warned in 2018 that 'the prospect
of machines with the discretion and power to take human life is morally
repugnant'.33 Opponents of these weapon systems allege that they will
result in the 'dronification' of foreign affairs and the dehumanisation
of warfare: because the use of drones reduces the need to deploy
soldiers, political leaders might be more inclined to resort to force or
escalation during a crisis, with war as the result. If both contestants
possess such an arsenal, what happens when one of them runs out of these
systems?34 As a number of potential adversaries will certainly continue
to field unmanned systems and develop military AI applications, NATO
member states will need to recalibrate their capability portfolios to
include defensive counter-drone capabilities and, given their increased
vulnerability to drone attack, will need to reconsider which wars are
worth fighting. The advent of military AI also raises military-strategic
concerns, including how NATO should respond if Russia and China
successfully integrate military AI and get inside Western OODA loops.
NATO member states will therefore need to consider which military AI
applications they want to develop and under which specific conditions
they deem their use ethically acceptable.

A related concern pertains to the deployment of immature AI to the
battlefield, which would increase fog and friction and fuel unwanted
escalatory spirals. The potential destabilising effects of the
combination of new and, in some cases, untested technologies and their
impact on the strategic balance of power, escalation dynamics and war
presents another challenge. [Emerging military space capabilities will
pose a **serious risk** to the **dynamics** underlying **deterrence** in
a multipolar world which are already under pressure due to a new
generation of]{.underline} multiple independently targeted re-entry
vehicles (**[MIRVs]{.underline}**), the emergence of
**[hypersonic]{.underline}** (\> Mach 5) [missile gliders and the advent
of global **c**onventional **p**rompt **s**trike **s**ystems. If
military powers can **shut down**]{.underline} the eyes and ears of
[adversaries by taking out their satellite systems, these adversaries
may be unable to (fully) retaliate. This **undermines credible
deterrence** and **creates escalatory tendencies** by giving parties an
**incentive** to **strike first**. Ubiquitous surveillance systems
(including spacebased sensors)]{.underline} [that are guided by AI and
can reveal the location of **nuclear missiles**]{.underline} (even
onboard submarines) [increase this risk, as the accurate knowledge these
systems provide might prompt **pre-emptive strikes** or **deliberate
escalation** and **risk-taking**]{.underline}. Increasingly effective
cyber attacks against nuclear C2 systems can likewise undermine
deterrence. Hypersonic weapons (with conventional or nuclear pay loads),
which can evade current state-of-the-art missile defence systems, may
render C2 facilities, aircraft carriers and nuclear missile complexes
vulnerable.35 The potential unintended strategic consequences of each of
the new technologies, and in particular the unpredictable effects of
their deployment in combination, will certainly be topics of
considerable political and societal debate within NATO's European
populations that do not necessarily support increases in defence
expenditures in general and increased spending on nuclear and unmanned
capabilities in particular.

### 2AC -- Clarifying Key

#### Article 5 is the [most important]{.underline} barrier to cohesive NATO space policy 

**Stickings 20** \[Alexandra Stickings, RUSI Newsbrief, 15 October 2020,
"Space as an Operational Domain: What Next for NATO?,"
https://rusi.org/publication/rusi-newsbrief/space-operational-domain-what-next-nato\]

Military Sciences, NATO

While it is encouraging that the Alliance is moving forward in its
thinking on the space domain, questions remain. Will the Alliance
continue to rely on the assets of a relatively small number of members,
and how will collective priorities be balanced against those of
individual states? Similarly, what does this mean for states with few or
no sovereign space assets, and will investment in space become a
requirement for all members in the future? Finally, and
**[most]{.underline}** **[importantly]{.underline}**, **[how do
activities in space fit into the context of an event that triggers
Article 5?]{.underline}** [**These are all issues NATO will need to
grapple with to ensure it fully realises the benefits that space can
bring and is able to withstand any activities that threaten its access.
Recognising the importance of the domain is one thing, deciding how to
act is another**.]{.underline}

NATO AND SPACE: A BRIEF HISTORY

[NATO was formed before the beginning of the first 'space
age']{.underline} and [for most of its history, the US has provided the
majority of available space assets]{.underline}, such as the US Air
Force-managed GPS system, which is used for a range of activities
including navigation and precision-guided munitions. Although a
programme beginning in the early 1970s saw the deployment of NATO
communications satellites, this policy was changed in the early 2000s to
one giving NATO access to satellites operated by member states. Since
that time, NATO has not operated its own space assets, instead relying
on members to provide access and information.

National satellite programmes have played an increasingly important role
in NATO operations, both during conflict and in its ongoing operations,
training exercises and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance
(ISR) activities. NATO's 2019 declaration is a recognition of these
longstanding activities and intention to respond to the increased
security concerns regarding space rather than a completely new policy in
itself. [Space is now a priority]{.underline}, rather than an
afterthought. [It does]{.underline}, however, [raise a question as to
whether the current model is]{.underline} effective, relying as it does
on the goodwill of states to share their assets and the difficulties
that can be present in [ensuring integration]{.underline} and
interoperability. While this recognition is a step forward, [**further
issues must be taken into consideration** for the development of a
**truly workable NATO space policy and strategy**]{.underline}.

#### That splits the alliance.

Relations; \"Technology and Strategy: the Changing Security Environment

While Also Preparing for the Worst by Strengthening NATO's Role in Space

Given the importance of space assets for Western military and civilian
operations, and the risk of negotiation failures in arms control
initiatives, Germany should, however, also support NATO considerations
to designate space as a military-operational domain of its own, set
apart from land, air, sea and cyberspace. A domain describes a "critical
macro maneuver space whose access or control is vital to the freedom of
action and superiority required by the mission".7 [Designating space
as]{.underline} such [a **domain** would prompt NATO more closely to
**analyze** its **vulnerabilities** in space and its dependence on both
civilian and military space-based assets]{.underline}. This would
increase NATO's understanding of the entanglement of space and non-space
operations and facilitate considerations about deterrence and defense in
space.

[NATO member states will also have to answer]{.underline} two [**crucial
questions** for the alliance: Does an **attack** on the **space asset**
of one **ally** constitutes an **Article 5** incident]{.underline}? And
will national space assets come under the command of NATO in case of an
attack?

[NATO's position on cyberattacks might serve as an **example** for
**integrating space** into the **Article 5-framework**, especially given
the fact that cyber- and electronic attacks on space assets are the
**most likely** ones. NATO has so far kept the threshold for triggering
Article 5 **consciously vague** in cyberspace]{.underline}, ultimately
[leaving it to the **N**orth **A**tlantic **C**ouncil to
**decide**]{.underline} whether to count an attack as an Article 5
event. [A **similar approach** could be taken to cover **non-physical
attacks** on space assets, while physical attacks could be covered by
**Article 4** of the **N**orth **A**tlantic **T**reaty, which states
that allies can "**consult together**]{.underline} whenever, in the
opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political
independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened".8 [In the
case of cyberspace, the alliance designated cyberattacks as a **possible
trigger** for Article 5, even before it designated cyberspace as its own
military-operational domain]{.underline}.9 Given the close integration
of most space and other military assets, it would further make sense for
NATO members to subordinate their space assets to NATO supreme command
in case of an attack on the alliance, just as with other military
capabilities.

Declaring space as a domain would align NATO with some of its major
members in this regard, since the USA10, the UK11, France12 and
Germany13 all list space as an operational domain beside land, air, sea,
and cyberspace. While NATO allies hold largely identical threat
perceptions about the changing security environment in space,
disagreements might arise over the importance of space and the
re-allocation of resources (i.e. funds and personnel) toward developing
NATO's instruments, structures, and capabilities in a future space
domain. Furthermore, the debate about subordinating national space
assets will, most likely, see diverging opinions within the alliance,
especially by states with a high interest in retaining their strategic
autonomy. Moreover, allies might disagree over the central question of
whether to weaponize space -- that is, to station offensive weapons in
orbit --, or whether to pursue other instruments to increase their
resilience, such as arms control regimes or more passive reactions like
the duplication of space assets. Consequently, Germany should facilitate
the political debate within the alliance about these open questions and
potential challenges. As the scheduled NATO summit in London on December
3-4, 2019 will address "current and emerging security challenges",14
[space]{.underline} might become [an important topic]{.underline}. It
also [has the potential to further **deepen** NATO's **internal rifts**
if it is not properly addressed]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- No Lasers

#### It's propaganda--the technology needed to destroy satellites with lasers is years away and current ones only destroy drones

Theresa **Hitchens 5/19**, Space and Air Force reporter at Breaking
Defense. The former Defense News editor was a senior research associate
at the University of Maryland's Center for International and Security
Studies at Maryland (CISSM), 5/19/2022, "Don't be dazzled by Russia's
laser weapons claims: Experts", Breaking Defense,
https://breakingdefense.com/2022/05/dont-be-dazzled-by-russias-laser-weapons-claims-experts/

The [ability to **dazzle** a **satellite** at that range **isn't** a
particularly **amazing** capability, especially given that most modern
optical imaging satellites carry cameras that included lenses
that]{.underline} function like human eyelids, and [**simply** **close**
when they detect any potentially blinding light source]{.underline}
(natural or otherwise).

["Laser systems that can damage tougher and more distant targets such as
ICBMs or orbiting satellites are quite some **years**
**away**.]{.underline} Satellite sensors definitely can be vulnerable to
being dazzled or blinded if they are not protected, but certainly much
less so if they are well-designed," Grego said.

The 2022 Defense Intelligence Agency report on "Challenges to Security
in Space," which tends toward the forward-leaning in its threat
assessments, found that [**Beijing** "may" field lasers that could cause
structural satellite damage by the mid- to **late**-**2020s**; and
**Russia** **maybe** by **2030**.]{.underline}

As for Zadira, Borisov's comments appear to indicate that [it is aimed
at **drones**, **not** **satellites**. That makes sense, said one
defense industry source, in that Ukraine is successfully deploying
drones in the on-going war.]{.underline}

"This article seems to be lumping together counterdrone lasers with
counterspace lasers. [Those are two very **different** **applications**,
and I have not yet seen anything to suggest that Russia has used
counterspace laser,"]{.underline} the industry source said.

"Counterdrone lasers make perfect sense and that is not surprising at
all --- Russia is getting hammered by small, loitering drones right now.
[I'm not **convinced** their 'prototype' system will actually prove
effective]{.underline}, but I have no doubt they are trying to get it to
work," the source added.

Grego agreed: "The [Zadira looks to be a battlefield laser weapon
designed to target nearby and relatively fragile systems such as
**drones**.]{.underline} Countries like the United States already deploy
laser systems for such targets. The Army has short-range laser defenses
and the Navy is beginning to field a system that could target things
like rubber dinghies, and the Pentagon is aiming to field more powerful
systems that could destroy artillery or mortars."

Just last month Breaking Defense reported Israel's announcement that its
laser system took out not only drones but mortars and rockets in
mid-air.

Among those less than impressed with the Kremlin's claim was Ukrainian
[President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who **mocked** **it as desperate
propaganda.**]{.underline}

4.3 Cyber Threats Against GNSS

Ground stations - how can we prevent threats? [Preventive method and
time-based method.]{.underline} Previous attack on ISS. [GNSS are
specifically vulnerable to hostile cyber operations because of the very
low power of their signals and services and constitute potential primary
targets in future wars because of their importance not only for military
operations, but also for **critical national infrastructure** and **key
economic sectors**.]{.underline} Unlike physical attacks they are not
likely to cause major damages to the satellite navigation system. Recent
cyber operations against GNSS were jamming and spoofing \[48\] although
other types of attacks such as hacking or eavesdropping of
communications satellite systems, are also technically possible. In
2018, during NATO Trident Juncture, NATO\'s biggest military maneuverer
since the end of the Cold War \[49\] took place in southern and central
Norway, plus the North Atlantic and Baltic Sea between October 25 and
November 7. NATO officials confirmed the disruption on November 11
\[50\]. Cybersecurity for satellite Ground Systems has been neglected.
[With the increasing number of small satellites and a global network of
ground stations]{.underline} needed to provide low latency for data
getting between low earth orbit and users, [the threat surface for
cyberattacks has **grown significantly**. We are in a phase in which we
need to mitigate the risks by simplifying the necessary controls, using
time-based methods for analysing controls and preventive cybersecurity
mechanisms on new systems in order to provide data
assurance.]{.underline} The targeting of space ground systems increased
over the last years with highly sophisticated attacks occurring over the
last couple of years. Many attacks took place for different reasons,
like the non-update of certain vital software to the operating system
and that was the case of the International Space Station computers. In
2008, hackers infiltrated the Johnson Space Center's mission control
computer network and were able to have the mission control network
upload a malicious Trojan horse access program onto computers on the ISS
disrupting on-board communications \[51\]. In March 2011, the theft of
an unencrypted NASA laptop resulted in the loss of algorithms used to
command and control the International Space Station \[52\]. Another
cybersecurity issue concerns the vulnerabilities in GPS receivers'
software which rendered GPS's precision timing invalid. Here instead of
spoofing or jamming the GPS signal, the actors attack the inherent
weaknesses of GPS's design to disrupt the timing. [Most of the existing
cybersecurity risk management policies emphasize on identifying
potential cybersecurity issues in the early phase of
acquisition]{.underline}, in a way the security of these systems is
built into the ground systems right before the deployment. [The first
step in a good cybersecurity strategy is having a risk management
framework to determine what assets are most attractive to hackers and
how they should be protected.]{.underline} This means considering all
the existing assets (physical and virtual) and the cost associated with
the access to these assets by the hacker. We need to consider the type
of data that we have in transit like the commands and control
communications, live monitoring information, satellite data that will be
transferred and the data at rest like databases with satellite
information, secured APIs etc. Among the existing effective frameworks,
we mention [the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification]{.underline}
(CMMC) \[53\] that [is a program initiated by the United States
**Department of Defense**]{.underline} (DoD) [in order to measure their
defence contractors\' capabilities, readiness, and sophistication in the
area of cybersecurity.]{.underline} The CMMC have different stages of
security maturity: 1. Scanning - This is the first step that a
corporation thinking about cybersecurity will have; 2. Managed
Assessment and Compliance; 3. Formalized Analysis and Prioritization;
and 4. Attack Focused Management ending with Stage Optimization While
existing frameworks provide current guidance on cybersecurity, it's
important to monitor for any recommended changes on a regular basis.
[Many security control models only address the presence of controls
first and do not quantify what those controls provide. The assessment of
risk in these models remains qualitative and the risk in these models
becomes a subjective measurement. The Time-Based Security method
develops the idea of the evaluation of every security measure a system
puts in place using a simple mathematical formula for the: **Protection
Time \> Detection Time + Response Time** Protection Time is the time a
security measure will provide before it becomes compromised or
disrupted. Detection Time is the time it takes for the people
controlling the system to find out that a compromise occurred. Response
Time is the time it takes those people controlling the system to act
accordingly.]{.underline} As a result, [protection measures from every
security process should allocate more protection time than it takes for
the system managers to detect and respond to the potential
attack.]{.underline} This model provides a method for evaluating
successive multiple controls. If the satellite control console is the
target, then each successive control preventing access to it is judged.
A high-level example could test the time it takes attackers to: (1)
access to the base network, (2) access to the satellite control network,
and finally, (3) access to the console. Commanders then can make true
risk-based decisions on whether they can afford additional protections.
The major issue of a quantitative time-based model becomes the
requirement for granular testing of every security control on an
existing system. The time-based method is applied to new systems, but
the selection of security controls becomes a difficult process if the
system designers do not consider security at the outset of the design.
The selection of security controls in the time-based model may overwhelm
system designers. Without an idea of what to protect in a new or
modernized ground system, the quantitative model only provides best
guesses. Consequently, the quantitative models work best in existing
systems. Another model for risk-based evaluation of space ground systems
uses a preventative mission assurance model based on redefining
cyberspace as anything processing a signal and then using the six steps
of the data lifecycle: generation, processing, storage, communication,
consumption, and destruction in evaluating the risk to the system.
Unlike the other models that consider the detection and usually the
threat vector, this preventive model focuses specifically on the
vulnerability \[51\] Generally, if we can build a system without
vulnerabilities of the operating system then we can assure security.
This preventative model requires the reengineering of communication
channels. It does not provide adaptive methods for dealing with existing
cyber security channels as those found in existing space systems. In the
future, this model will be extremely considered for the modernization
and re-engineering of the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN)
ground station network architecture coordinating communications to more
than 100 satellites via nine ground stations positioned around the
globe. Threat elements release new risks of attacks daily, so security
operations should be adapted in a sustainable way. It is crucial to
consider risk models to assess the strength of existing controls against
the threats addressing most potential security vulnerabilities. Having
an established framework that will react fast and effectively is
mandatory at this stage. Quantum technologies bring potential new
capabilities, to develop parameters of threats, solve the algorithms
behind encryption keys that protect our data and the Internet\'s
infrastructure and transform cybersecurity. capabilities and negate
adversarial interference with space systems.

5.1 Strategies for building defences for the intersection of space &
cyber domains, considering the provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty
and other relevant instruments of the Organization

NATO relies on its Allied capabilities; therefore, it is essential to
have a unique coordinate system to respond during a crisis. [The already
existing exercises, such as the Crisis Management Exercise (CMX) which
focus on cyber, and resilience should be implemented with space assets.
This internal and partner consultation and decision-making procedures at
the strategic political **military level** would help to strengthen the
alliance response and resilience.]{.underline} Therefore, NATO has to
operate with a renewed focus on improving proficiency in Allied
Cyberspace and Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations, by building
awareness, developing policies and strategies, acquiring new
capabilities, working with industry and academia, and training people to
become experts. Building defence is possible by "raising awareness"
throughout the NATO systems, and [by creation of regulation through NATO
security framework , in a standardized and collective way which require
a proactive effort to prevent, detect and prepare forces to respond to
incidents, by developing guidelines, resources, and working groups
focusing on emerging technologies to protect the space assets, and test
coherency of the rules and their application by raising preparedness,
building blocks between law and policy requirements for collective
defence.]{.underline} The traditional policy creation mechanisms are
based on multilateralism. States and most of the traditional
international organizations struggle to adapt themselves to evolving
realities of the new technologies and their applications and
implications in new domains, such as cyber and space. Another aspect is
to keep the will and interests of member states alive for policy
development. This requires NATO to revise and update/adapt its
mechanisms, in a way to support a clear-eyed, inclusive policy
development, to overcome siloed or single domain-based approaches, to
manoeuvre and react in the extremely complex environments. [As a
**military-security organization**]{.underline}, and as to its
foundational concerns, unlike UN, [NATO]{.underline} cannot represent an
open forum for the intellectual construction, however, [can support and
benefit from the effective participation]{.underline} of the commercial
actors, which own operate and manage these new domains, [and can assess
and adapt these new policies created to remain at the speed of
relevance]{.underline}, as highlighted in JAPCC 2021 meeting this year.

### 2AC -- Say Yes -- General

#### NATO will say yes--they've been experiencing widespread cyber attacks on satellites and need better security

David **Jones 3/18**, reporter for Cybersecurity Dive. He has been a
reporter and editor for more than 25 years, 3/18/2022, Cybersecurity
Dive, "Cyberthreats grow as US, NATO countries press Russia sanctions",
https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cyberthreats-russia-war/620640/

The [FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on
Thursday said they are aware of possible threats to **satellite**
communications **networks** **in** the **U.S. and abroad**]{.underline}.
The [agencies are urging organizations to check for insecure remote
access tools]{.underline} and urging companies report any suspicious
network activity.

Dive Insight:

[Cyberthreats against U.S. and allied]{.underline} companie[s will come
from a variety of sources, ranging from state-sponsored actors and
others sympathetic to Russia, according to Forrester.]{.underline}

Major energy companies like Shell, Exxon and BP have left billions of
dollars on the table after withdrawing from business in Russia.
Mastercard and Visa also pulled out and iconic brands like Coca-Cola and
McDonald's suspended new business amid mounting consumer pressure to
cease operations.

[Attacks may come from sympathetic ransomware groups like Conti,
ransomware as a service operators or even insiders sympathetic to
Russian interests, according to Forrester.]{.underline}

"There's [**no** **such** **thing** **as** **neutral** in something like
this," Jeff Pollard, VP, principal analyst at Forrester,]{.underline}
said via email, adding that companies really don't have a choice to stay
on the sidelines.

"The stance your company takes does come with risks --- and your
cybersecurity team needs to be ready for the choices your company takes,
because any stance marks you as a target for some set of threat actors,"
he said.

Forrester is urging corporate CISOs to help prepare a communications
plan to the board of directors and top executives. Businesses should
update plans constantly to prevent being surprised by events.

Executives should even prepare a list of frequently asked questions, so
senior executives can properly communicate any security risk questions
to the public, the research firm said.

[Multiple threats have already been identified directly targeting
organizations in Ukraine as well as more **widespread** **threats**
**facing** **Europe** **and** **U.S. organizations**.]{.underline}
Earlier this week, ESET researchers released information about a third
data wiping malware, called CaddyWiper, which destroyed user data and
partition information.

Prior research uncovered HermeticWiper and IsaacWiper. Russian
state-sponsored actors have also targeted organizations by exploiting
the PrintNightmare vulnerability and misconfigured MFA settings.

[Critical infrastructure providers have been on high alert regarding the
potential for retaliatory threats against **U.S. or other western**
**organizations**.]{.underline}

"CISA remains concerned about the threat to U.S. and allied satellite
communications networks," Eric Goldstein, executive assistant director
for cybersecurity at CISA, said in a statement, while [urging
**organizations** to **immediately** **implement** the **steps** in the
advisory.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Say Yes -- Turkey

#### Turkey will say yes--they want a better cybersecurity framework to follow from NATO

Kieran **Hatton 20**, Design Research Intern Duo Security Leveraging
User Insight Data to Improve Passwordless Experiences on 36 Million
Devices, 4/27/2020, "Turkey's New Cyber Security Center is Necessary,
but is It Enough?", Medium,
https://medium.com/meddah-a-u-s-turkey-storytelling-project/turkeys-new-cyber-security-center-is-necessary-but-is-it-enough-89b7ef8cd347

However, [USOM's defenses are **unlikely** **to** **dissuade** stronger
foreign state actors, like those involved in the United Arab Emirates
remote hacking of former Turkish deputy prime minister Mehmet
Şimşek]{.underline}, from [seeking ways to disrupt Turkish cyber
protections. States like Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia maintain
competitive relations with Turkey. These nations are therefore
incentivized to deploy malware to harm critical Turkish
infrastructure.]{.underline}

[Turkey should implement a **cybersecurity** **framework**. Attacks from
foreign states as well as non-state actors are often effective given the
Turkish government's lack of familiarity with cybersecurity
measures.]{.underline} Turkish government officials have been reported
using unencrypted, traditional email or other unsecured accounts to
transmit sensitive information. A [cybersecurity framework streamlines
digital defense measures and **greatly** **reduces** the risk of
**cyber** **threats** by providing a blueprint for systems which meet
rigorous cybersecurity standards. These can be in various forms:
multinational, like the European Union's Cybersecurity Certification
Framework; organizational, like the International Organization for
Standardization's]{.underline} (ISO) 2700 and National Institute for
Standards and Technology's (NIST) framework; and, even indigenous, like
the Saudi Arabia Monetary Authority Cybersecurity Framework.

[For more robust systems to bolster USOM without an explicit
cybersecurity framework, Turkish cybersecurity experts and government
officials may **seek** **help** **from** National Atlantic Treaty
Organization (**NATO**]{.underline}) allies. The Turkish government can
access incredible resources through two central channels: The Cyber
Security Collaboration Hub (CSCH) and the Cooperative Cyber Defence
Centre of Excellence (CCDCE).

Within NATO, the Communications and Information Agency (NCI) oversees
the CSCH. The CSCH is newer than the CCDCE. Established in February
2019, the CSCH is an NCI initiative to provide an information center to
benefit NATO countries' CERTs. The CSCH did not require member state
buy-in, additional costs, or staff changes. Turkey's USOM maintains a
route of access to this resource as a member nation of NATO. Both the
CSCH and USOM are newer additions to NATO's cybersecurity force and may
experience organizational growing pains throughout the next few years.

While accredited through --- but not part of --- NATO, the Cooperative
Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCE) aggregates cyber resources
among Sponsoring Nations in NATO. In 2018, 21 members participated as
Sponsoring Nations, including Turkey. As such, Turkish experts can
access CCDCE archives and collected cybersecurity documentation.

The CCDCE's Tallinn Manual 2.0, a collection of rigorous research
regarding cyber operations and the applicability of international law to
the cyber realm, may also inform Turkish military strategy through
cyberwarfare.

[**Cyberwarfare** **remains** a **formidable** force in the face of
dwindling traditional warfighting. Turkish armed forces, observing
health precautions following the novel coronavirus, abated their attacks
in Iraq and Syria without halting them completely. Unintended
consequences of this continued fighting could include increased Syrian
refugees flooding into areas under Turkish control,]{.underline}
creating a hotbed for the potential spread of COVID-19. Hundreds of
infected residing in camps could quickly turn into thousands across
northeastern Syria and southwestern Turkey. Cyber offensives present an
option to pursue Turkish interests while minimizing casualties on and
off the battlefield.

USOM needs to be the first step in a process of erecting cyber defenses
across the country. A nascent program is not necessarily ineffective,
but the center will have to combat many cyberattacks against Turkey's
still-vulnerable systems. The [country must implement a cybersecurity
framework, utilize NATO **resources**]{.underline}, and seek ways to
expand USOM's team and training to other SOCs amid the COVID-19 pandemic
[to truly provide robust cybersecurity protections against the majority
of cyberattacks.]{.underline}

Quick facts

Quantum computers will be millions of times faster than any conventional
computer, which means that they will be able to decipher passwords,
personal identification numbers and other current safeguards quickly,
putting confidential and personal information at risk.

Current quantum encryption technology (QKD), relies on ground
fibre-optic cables and is currently limited to a 200-kilometre distance.
QEYSSat will seek to demonstrate QKD between a satellite and a ground
network as a way to overcome the distance limits.

[Through testing and demonstration of the QKD in space, the **CSA** will
**provide** a government-owned, space-based **platform** **for** federal
**stakeholders** and Canada\'s scientific community.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Solves ASATs

#### Utilizing [active]{.underline} AND [passive countermeasures]{.underline} perfects defense against [ASAT attacks]{.underline} and promotes [info sharing]{.underline} and [trust]{.underline}.

5 [Actions]{.underline} that Can Be Taken [to Contrast
**ASAT**]{.underline} Weapon**[s]{.underline}**

In order to protect its space-based assets from adversary ASAT attacks,
[NATO needs to take]{.underline} certain [countermeasures]{.underline}.
These [**countermeasures** can]{.underline} be either [passive or
active. **Passive countermeasures** are practices such as]{.underline}
stationing **[decoy satellites]{.underline}**, [increasing]{.underline}
the [maneuverability]{.underline} of satellites, [so as to]{.underline}
be able to [avoid **kinetic attacks**]{.underline}, [and
hardening]{.underline} their [components]{.underline}, [such
as]{.underline} their remote [sensors]{.underline}, [in order to
withstand an attack]{.underline}. **[Active
countermeasures]{.underline}** would entail [equip]{.underline}ping
[satellites with **defence mechanisms**]{.underline} or non destructive
countermeasures such as jamming \[27\].

[The increase]{.underline} and the wide range [of ASAT has
ensured]{.underline} that [resilience was used to safeguard
**activities**]{.underline} in Space. There has been an increase in the
number of cybernetic systems with defence and security strategies.

[**Cyber security** should]{.underline} reduce the risk of a
cyber-attack and [protect the satellite. This would reduce the
risk]{.underline} but would not eliminate it because there is always the
possibility of the satellite being hacked. [The only activity that can
be done is to work on the capacity of **cyber resilience**]{.underline}
because this allows the continuity of the satellite's operation in such
a way as not to influence the activities of the system.

The US Department of Defence considered the occurrence of an attack on a
single or multiple satellites. On this end, there has been an increase
in the number of satellites in order to have a continuous coverage even
with the failure of some units of the system.

[With the increase of **nano-satellites**]{.underline} and
mega-constellations [an attack would be able to stop an entire system
because a **single satellite** is interconnected]{.underline} with
others for sharing information. For this reason not only the number of
satellites should be higher but there should be several constellations
isolated from each other so that the operation of the constellation or
satellite continues even after an attack. This would be considered as a
redundancy that prevents data and activity loss.

Good [practices that support the **creation** and **sustainability** of
**effective national capacities** in order to provide]{.underline}
system **[resilience]{.underline}** are those that can prevent and what
can be "emergency plans" that should provide "an overview of national
incident response mechanisms; in addition to highlight how cybersecurity
incidents are classified, based on their impact on critical goods and
services".

**[Info]{.underline}**rmation [**sharing** is another key point because
during an attack **accurate** and **appropriate** communication
can]{.underline} eventually [lead to the identification of the
attackers]{.underline}. Many organisations in the World, such as NATO,
are conducting exercises in this field. Periodically NATO implements
exercises and simulations of war and cyber attack (CMX) \[28\].

These international [computer **security simulations** help to
strengthen]{.underline} the [**responsiveness** and **resilience** of
states and strengthen **trust** between countries]{.underline} and
improve overall international resilience and preparedness levels.
[Resilience should focus on]{.underline} two topics: "[**Critical
Infrastructure**" and "**Critical Information Infrastructures**". The
first is essential for]{.underline} the functioning and [security of a
company and an economy while the second]{.underline} is the system that
[manages the **key functions** of the critical
infrastructure]{.underline}. These two must be protected in accordance
with the principle of risk management and resilience.

[**Recommendations** and Observations]{.underline}

Some of the recommendations and observations suggested below are
activities that are currently in the planning stage -- as part of the
NATO Space Working Group Action Plan, or as part of ongoing discussions
with allies. However, these activities have not yet been implemented and
require continuous attention.

[Encouraging allied member countries to be responsible for protecting
their own space capabilities, and to consider space in national force
structures rather than in the NATO command structure.]{.underline}
In addition, NATO should consider how the configuration for space assets
between the allies and NATO would look in time of conflict.

There is a need for a NATO Centre of Excellence (CoE) for space.
In cyberspace, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence
(CCDCOE) shares information between NATO, the allies and NATO partner
countries. However, the alliance lacks an established
CoE for space policy.

[NATO is trying to **link national space operational centres** (to date,
these include those of the UK and Canada) in order to establish routine
contact and for regular information-sharing. It would be valuable
to incorporate all allies that have space capabilities into this
initiative; and to start discussions with allies that have space
aspirations.]{.underline}

[NATO lacks a 24/7 operational cell that can observe and monitor
activities relating to space.]{.underline} It could create a space
coordination cell, in order to coordinate knowledge and data in all
of the six capability areas outlined in this paper.

[Further planning needs to go into the integration of new technologies
when securing satellites from cyberattack.]{.underline} Aspirations
in this area may include the ability for satellites to configure and fix
themselves.

A NATO Industrial Advisory Group (NIAG) study is required in order
to examine ways of sharing information between NATO and the private
sector. Through this study, NIAG could provide industry advice to the
Conference of National Armaments Directors and to other NATO units. Such
advice could shape NATO military capability requirements and be linked
to the next cycle of the NDPP.

[Current cybersecurity maturity standards and guidelines (such as those
published by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology) help
organizations to improve their cybersecurity measures and best
practices. How effectively **cybersecurity maturity standards** can
be applied to space-sector maturity **should be analysed**
further.]{.underline} If the two areas are different in essence, then
separate standards and guidelines for space could be developed.

[**Securing space assets** against cyberattacks **at the design stage**
is particularly important, and should be a fundamental component
of satellite and ground station design from the initial concept --
giving rise to a 'security-by-design' approach.]{.underline}

[Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) help **improve
collaboration and resilience** in the cyber realm. Similar types
of national centres **in the space sector** could provide insights and
could **improve engagement between allies.**]{.underline}

The annual NATO Information Assurance Symposium (NIAS) Cyber Security
Symposium could focus on space in upcoming years.

[The potential establishment of a NATO science and technology committee,
involving or led by the NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI
Agency), could be further explored. Such a committee could be relied
upon to give advice on relevant cyberthreats and vulnerabilities, such
as those related to the integrity or security of supply
chains.]{.underline}

[The NCI Agency is responsible for operating and defending NATO's
networks, and rapid sharing of **info**rmation has proved to be one
of the most effective defences in cyberspace. In the cyber domain, there
are certain tools in place -- such as the Malware Information Sharing
Platform (MISP) -- that promote cooperation and information-sharing
among allies. **Info**rmation-sharing could also be more closely
examined in relation to the space sector. Through **sharing
information** and **explanations of operational impact**, NATO could
**increase allies' awareness** with regards to space-based
threats.]{.underline}

[NATO should further increase its efforts to strengthen its cyberdefence
posture through the NATO **I**ndustry **C**yber
**P**artnership]{.underline}: enhancing collaboration between the public
and private sectors is one of the fastest and least expensive ways
to increase cyber resilience, improve incident handling and mitigate
vulnerability to attack. [Moreover, this should foster timely
**info**rmation-sharing on cyberthreats, allowing stakeholders
to enhance situational awareness and better protect their networks.
In practice, for instance, it should facilitate **rapid and early**
bilateral exchange of non-classified technical information related
to cyberthreats and vulnerabilities. Improvements in the cyber domain
would have a **positive impact** on the space realm.]{.underline}

Under a future NATO Space Policy, defence planners should define NATO's
space capability requirements and present them to all allies by means
of the NDPP.73

NATO Space Policy could lead to recognizing space as the fifth domain.
This would help NATO better plan for future operations that use space
assets and technology and to incorporate space into the defence planning
structure.

Increasing awareness at all levels require holistic exercises and tests
in order to give end users experience in how these systems actually
work. Therefore, space considerations should be incorporated into
existing exercises and training.

[The **entanglement between commercial and military** space assets may
also cause vulnerabilities. In future, military systems will
be increasingly connected to non-military systems. This has important
implications for the **laws of armed conflict**, as the combination
of civilian, commercial and military capabilities in the cyber domain
and space raises the risk that civilian capabilities used for military
purposes qualify as legitimate military targets.]{.underline}

NATO should ensure that contractors that rely on commercial standards
follow minimum cybersecurity arrangements.

[NATO may consider ensuring that commercial contracts meet **military
protection standards**, in order to **mitigate the risk** posed by the
military's use of commercial space assets.]{.underline}

[NATO should conduct a gap analysis that will identify the following:
which countries NATO relies upon for space services; what type
of capabilities these countries possess; what type of capabilities they
should have for future warfare; and what actions NATO needs to take
(the latter being subsequently enshrined in **an action
plan**).]{.underline}

[Although NATO does not lead development of the space sector and it is
the allies that provide space capabilities, NATO can still **initiate**
informal **discussions** with the allies on the **establishment
of targets** for space resilience. In the cyber realm, for instance,
**cybersecurity targets have been incorporated into the
NDPP.**]{.underline}

[Mapping out **recurring threats to space systems** and promoting
**standardization** to address common weaknesses may **increase
resilience**. If standardization is unwanted due to its risks, then
a voluntary 'best practice' approach can be utilized. NATO's military
command may also enter into direct discussions with the allies to set
up **minimum requirements**.]{.underline} In this regard, a commanders'
intent paper can also capture space infrastructure.

#### NATO is growing increasingly reliant on its cyber and space capabilities -- space based assets provide services important to deterrence and security 

Karl-Heinz **Brunner 21**, member NATO Parliamentary Assembly and the
Bundestag Defence Committee and Subcommittee on Disarmament, Arms
Control, and Non-Proliferation, October 2021, "Space and Security --
NATO's Role," NATO Parliamentary Assembly, Science and Technology
Committee,

Space is essential to the Alliance's deterrence and defence (NATO,
2020). NATO Allies rely heavily on space for the protection of their
homelands and for military operations around the globe. Space is an
"enabling domain" as it is closely interconnected with the other
security domains relevant for NATO: maritime, air, land, and cyber
space. [Together **with cyber,** **space will therefore play a critical
role for the security of Allied nations**. 37. Satellites provide
precise information on movements by friend and foe through imagery or
via signal interceptions. They transfer huge amounts of data from and to
the battlefield: operating a single Global Hawk, for instance, requires
roughly 500 megabits of satellite bandwidth per second.]{.underline}
This is five times the total amount of satellite communications that US
forces used during operations in the First Gulf War (The Economist,
2019). 38. During the 1991 Gulf War, often referred to as "the first
space war", space systems evolved from strategic assets to tactical
enablers. Satellites provided near real-time information down to the
tactical level throughout operation Desert Storm for the first time.
Space assets, originally developed to detect strategic missile launches,
were transformed into tools that worked "down to do scope reporting" in
1991 (Strout, 2021). The use of satellite-based information contributed
to the quick and decisive victory of the US-led forces. 39. Today, [many
of **NATO's most advanced systems depend heavily on space-based
assets**]{.underline}. Examples include the Alliance's Ballistic Missile
Defence (BMD) programme, the Airborne Warning and Control Systems
(AWACs) and the Ground Surveillance System (AGS) (Moon, 2017). NATO's
Joint Air Power (JAP) is equally dependent on the national capabilities
in the space domain of Allied states as they support operations in the
air as well as on the ground and on the seas (Bockel, 2018). 40. [The
Alliance defines five core areas where it heavily depends on space-based
assets]{.underline} (NATO, March 2020). These are [(1) **positioning and
navigation**: enabling precision strikes, force navigation or combat
search and rescue (CSAR) missions; (2) **integrated tactical warning and
threat assessment**: securing force protection, providing crucial
information on missile launches and thus allowing attribution; (3)
**environmental monitoring**: enabling meteorological forecasting and
sound mission planning; (4) **communications** for command and control
purposes and (5) **intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance** (ISR)
capabilities: providing intelligence on and off the battlefield and
informing targeting decisions]{.underline}. A key benefit of space
access is that it increases the ability of the Alliance to respond, thus
making it is crucially important for deterrence. [Deterrence is largely
based upon the adversary knowing that NATO is prepared to act, and to
act the Alliance must first Observe, Orientate and Decide, as described
by the military strategist John Boyd]{.underline}. Information gained
from space can accelerate the OODA loop (OODA loop -- Observe, Orient,
Decide, Act) and prevent the need for conflict through careful focused
action. 41. [Free access to space and resilient space infrastructures
are **essential for operational capability and defence**. As a
consequence, the dependence of modern armed forces on space has become
one of their greatest vulnerabilities]{.underline}. In the early days of
space infrastructure, only the U.S. and the Soviet Union were capable of
launching satellites into orbit. Space-denial technologies were either
non-existent or in their infancy. After the fall of the iron curtain,
the threat to Western space assets and capabilities was significantly
diminished. The recent evolution of space capabilities, especially on
the commercial side, and the increased number of space-faring nations
has changed this situation, however.

#### War in cyberspace opens vulnerabilities to seize control of satellites and shut them down

Abhijeet Singh **Baghel 19**, cybersecurity researcher, recipient of a
Master of Science in Cybersecurity from Utica College, December 2019,
"Cyber Warfare in Outer Space," p. 12-13

The [**need for cybersecurity.** Cyberspace is infused throughout each
warfighting domain]{.underline}. Outer space is no different and space
operations rely heavily on cyberspace to complete missions which means
this field is no stranger to cyberspace threats. [An adversary could use
a cyberattack to simply monitor and collect signals intelligence to use
against its target indirectly or could employ cyber espionage to gain
critical technical expertise to bolster military research and
development]{.underline} (Defense Intelligence Agency, 2019). In these
examples, intelligence gathered in cyberspace is weaponized to ensure
information superiority, which plays a vital role in military and
political strategy in times of war and peace. In addition to space
assets, [it is **important to protect classified space operations
intelligence** by ensuring its confidentiality, availability, and
integrity to successfully maintain space dominance]{.underline} (Mather,
2018). [When security measures are not adequate to ensure this, it opens
possibilities for adversaries to hack into space combatant commands and
operation centers and possibly corrupt important data or render space
assets useless by seizing control]{.underline} (Harrison, Johnson, &
Roberts, 2019). Cyberattacks are relatively cheap and do not require
substantial 13 resources to complete, just an understanding of the
sophisticated target. For example, [China is prepared to employ cyber
operations against U.S. satellite and ground stations to deescalate
future conflicts by preventing the U.S.'s ability to operate during the
early stages of a conflict]{.underline}. This is no surprise as China
has already performed cyberattacks on satellites belonging to the U.S.
Geological Survey, NASA, and NOAA and several others multiple times
since 2007 (Gruss, 2014 and Harrison, Johnson, & Roberts, 2019).

**Satellites key for ag**

Steven **Tompkins 19,** Inmarsat's director of sector development for
agriculture, 3/18/2022, "Inmarsat\'s Steven Tompkins cuts through the
jargon to explain why satellite connectivity is the key to a global,
digitalized agriculture industry,"
<https://www.inmarsat.com/en/insights/enterprise/2019/enabling-the-connected-farm-the-importance-of-satellite-communications.html>,
Inmarsat

The Agri-Tech Revolution, Agriculture 4.0, the smart and connected
farm. There is no shortage of buzzwords hinting at a digitalised future,
or solutions being touted as game-changing for the global agricultural
industry. Commonly claimed benefits include [**increasing** **crop**
**yields**, and a **reduction** **in** **input** costs and the reliance
on manual labour. ]{.underline}

[Many of these solutions]{.underline} [rely
on]{.underline} [reliable]{.underline} [internet]{.underline} [connectivity]{.underline} [in
the field]{.underline} [to push data]{.underline} [from one place to
another, but there are still vast swathes of agricultural land that
suffer from unreliable or non-existent connectivity, either lacking
cellular or broadband connectivity. If we are to take advantage of the
huge possibilities available to us, overcoming our connectivity
challenges will be crucial.]{.underline} 

**[This is where satellite communications can help]{.underline}**. When
I tell people that I am an agriculturalist working for a satellite
company, almost always the response is related to an experience of using
space imagery (known as [Earth Observation]{.underline}) [to help
automate processes such as crop scouting]{.underline}. [But there is
another breed of satellites that don't produce images but do provide
fast and reliable internet and voice communications across the world in
areas that cellular and fibre connectivity cannot reach]{.underline}. 

Ubiquitous connectivity from [satellites
opens up **huge** **possibilities** for farmers in remote areas to take
advantage of the Agri-Tech Revolution]{.underline}. In some cases, this
is as simple as connecting frontline worker teams in large plantations
to operations centres to prioritise workload and create efficiencies.
Taking it one step further, [satellite communications can be a bridge to
enable farmers to connect data producing devices in the field (such as
weather stations, sensors, data from farm machinery) to business
applications. ]{.underline}

Known by the tech world as the 'Internet of Things' or IoT,
this approach collects data from the field and harnesses it to **support
intelligent decision-making**. For instance: obtaining real-time data on
nutrient status in the field from NPK (Nitrogen Phosphorous and
Potassium) sensors, alongside crop monitoring data and hyper-local
weather that would allow you to [make completely]{.underline} [objective
risk-based decisions on when and where to apply
fertiliser. ]{.underline}

**Precision ag solves global food security\-\--satellites are key.**

Robert **Bell 18**, businessman with over 30 years of experience as an
association manager and business consultant for both nonprofit and
profit-driven and organizations operating in the IT outsourcing,
telecommunications, and financial services industries, 10/11/2018, "How
Will Precision Agriculture Feed the World?";
<https://www.satellitetoday.com/imagery-and-sensing/2018/10/11/how-will-precision-agriculture-feed-the-world/>,
Via Satellite

[By]{.underline} [the year]{.underline} [2050]{.underline}, [the world's
population is expected to hit 10 billion]{.underline}. [Feeding
that]{.underline} [population]{.underline} [will
mean]{.underline} **[increasing global food
production]{.underline}** [by 70 percent]{.underline} --- without
poisoning the world's water supply with nitrates in the process and
meeting rising demands for high food quality. 

[That]{.underline}, in a nutshell, [is]{.underline} [the
reason]{.underline} [why]{.underline} **[agriculture needs to go
digital]{.underline}**, and in a hurry. The good news is that
the [adoption of new]{.underline} [agriculture
technology]{.underline} (agtech) [over the past decade has been strong
in many places]{.underline}. According to a 2016 study from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, [tractors guided by]{.underline} Global
Positioning System ([GPS]{.underline}) [are in use on
50]{.underline} [percent of corn and soybean acreage]{.underline} [in
the U.S. Yield mapping]{.underline} --- which means [developing precise
data]{.underline} on what sections of a field produce the biggest yield
--- [is used on 40 percent of that acreage]{.underline}. Variable-Rate
Technology (VRT) covers about 30 percent with systems that apply
fertilizer based on yield maps, substantially reducing waste and excess
use.

The bad news comes in two flavors. First, big farms in excess of 2,900
acres are twice as likely to use agtech, because its scale makes it more
affordable and profitable. Second, precision agriculture is largely
restricted to rich nations. Their farmers have more money to spend, and
large farms make up a much higher percentage of land in agricultural
production.

A Better Glass of Wine As one example, take winegrowers. They are among
the high-end producers who have made precision agriculture central to
their business. They do yield mapping in great detail, down to 2-meter
blocks, and adding data on everything from soil acidity clay and water
retention to yield to every block. The [data comes
from]{.underline} [close inspection and testing in the
field]{.underline}, [but the]{.underline} **[mapping is made possible by
GPS]{.underline}**, [which]{.underline} [also]{.underline} [can be used
to
steer]{.underline} [mechanized]{.underline} [pruning]{.underline}, [watering]{.underline}, [and
harvesting machines]{.underline}. 

**[Satellite
imagery]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} also **[vital]{.underline}**. [Infrared
sensors in space produce data that can be analyzed to
produce]{.underline} a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
([NDVI]{.underline}), [which accurately measures the amount of leaf area
in]{.underline} [a block]{.underline}. Take repeated scans, and the
winegrower can see how much leaf the vines are putting on --- an
important measure of health --- and focus attention on the blocks where
there is too much or too little.

Held Back by Bandwidth This kind of technology investment has led some
to call today's farmers the high-tech entrepreneurs of rural regions.
But whether in rich or poor nations, those [high-tech entrepreneurs face
one big constraint]{.underline}: [bandwidth]{.underline}. According to
Microsoft, 23 million people in rural areas lack broadband internet
access in the U.S. In Europe, 21 percent of rural populations had no
access to the internet in 2017. Go to developing nations and the numbers
accelerate: 69 million in Brazil, 378 million in China, and 725 million
in India.

As we all know, there is broadband --- and then there's better
broadband. The computer I am working on is connected to the web at 300
Mbps at a cost of about \$80 per month. [Precision agriculture is part
of the Big Data revolution]{.underline}. [To leverage its
value]{.underline}, these rural [high-tech entrepreneurs
need]{.underline} significant [bandwidth for]{.underline} [download
of]{.underline} **[satellite imagery]{.underline}**, connectivity for
drones, access to cloud computing platforms that aggregate huge data
sets, and upload of their own big data sets. They need high-capacity
connectivity not only at home, but in the field. The alternative is to
drive all their automated equipment up to the barn and plug it in to
their computers for upload and download of data.

Precision farmers in developing nations are finding ingenious and
low-cost solutions that give them some capability over 3G and 4G mobile.
But we all know the limits of that connectivity, particularly in areas
where coverage is sparse. 

[If there were no other
reason]{.underline} [why]{.underline} Geostationary Orbit (GEO) High
Throughput Satellite (HTS) and the coming generation of **[high-capacity
Low Earth Orbit]{.underline}** (LEO) **[satellites]{.underline}** [were
needed]{.underline}, [this]{.underline} [requirement]{.underline} [would
be enough]{.underline}. [The market for precision farming technology is
estimated to be worth \$5.09 billion in 2018 and headed for \$9.53
billion in 2023]{.underline}, [growing at 13.4
percent]{.underline} Compound Annual Growth Rate ([CAGR]{.underline}).

Mother [Earth will have]{.underline} **[another 2.4
billion]{.underline}** [mouths to feed]{.underline} [in a few
decades]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [connected]{.underline}, [technology-rich
farm is the]{.underline} **[only way]{.underline}** [she is
going]{.underline} [to do it.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Debris

#### Squo [decentralized satellite planning]{.underline} endorses [Chinese]{.underline} cyber-attacks that cause satellites to collide, creating tons of [space debris]{.underline}\-\--otherwise known as the [Kessler Syndrome]{.underline}.

sg

[**Cyber Attacks** in Space]{.underline}. The life span of a satellite
is between five and 30 years, and even afterward it can still be
orbiting with enough propellant to move through space and with
functional communications which could be reactivated. [Space contains
thousands of satellites]{.underline}, both active and inactive,
[launched by]{.underline} numerous [organizations]{.underline} and
countries, hosting 5,000 space-borne transponders communicating with
Earth. [Every transmission is a potential inlet for a cyber
attack]{.underline}. Older [satellites share]{.underline}
[**technological similarities**, providing opportunities to]{.underline}
cyber-[exploit industrial systems]{.underline} for control and
processing. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems
within our municipalities, facilities, infrastructure, and factories are
designed and built on older technology and hardware, sometimes designed
decades ago, and the software is seldom updated. These [**SCADA
systems** are considered a strategic vulnerability]{.underline} and have
drawn growing attention from the US cyber-defense community in recent
years. Satellites may be based on hardware and technology from the 1980s
for one very simple reason---they are unlikely to be upgraded after they
have been launched into space.

[**Terrestrial cyber attacks** are a single exploit]{.underline} on
thousands, if not millions, of identical systems, [and the exploit will
be **eliminated**]{.underline} afterward by updates or upgrades. Th[e
difference between **satellites** and **terrestrial cyber** exploits is
that a satellite is in many cases custom made]{.underline}, whereas the
computing design is proprietary. Cyber attacks in space exploit a single
system, or limited group of systems, within a larger group of
satellites. These space-borne assets have a variety of operating
systems, embedded software, and designs from disparate technological
legacies. [As more nations engage in launching satellites]{.underline}
with a variety of technical sophistication, [the risk for hijacking and
manipulation through covert activity increases]{.underline}. A
satellite's onboard computer (OBC) can allow reconfiguration and
software updates, which increase its vulnerability to cyber-attacks. [A
**vulnerable satellite** that will be orbiting]{.underline} for the next
10 years [can be preset]{.underline} by a cyber perpetrator [for
**unauthorized usage**]{.underline} when needed.

Even with the most-advanced digital forensics tools, tracing a cyber
attack is complicated on terrestrial computer systems, which are
physically accessible. [**Space-borne systems** do not allow **physical
access**, thus, lack of access to the computer system
nullifies]{.underline} several [options for]{.underline} forensic
**[evidence gathering]{.underline}**. The only trace from the
perpetrator is the actual transmissions and wireless attempts to
penetrate the system. If these transmissions are not captured, the trace
is lost.

If the adversary is skilled, it is more likely the attribution
investigation will end with a set of spoofed innocent actors whose
digital identities have been exploited in the attack rather than
attribution to the real perpetrator. A strong suspicion would impact
interstate relations, but full attribution and traceability are needed
to create a case for reprisal and retaliation. Attribution can be
graduated, and the level varies as to what would be accepted as an
"attributed" attack. The national leadership can accept a lower level of
tangible attribution, based on earlier intelligence reports and
adversarial modus operandi, than the international community might
demand, but it is restrained in taking action. [China has had a growing
interest in]{.underline} building [cyber warfare]{.underline}
capabilities21 [and]{.underline} is one of several nations that [would
have a sincere interest in degrading **US space assets**.]{.underline}
Currently, nationstates are restrained by the political and economic
repercussions of an attributed attack, but [covert cyber war targeting
US space assets removes the **restraint of attribution**.]{.underline}

A [cyber attack resulting in a **space collision**]{.underline} would
lack attribution and thus [would be attractive to our **covert
adversaries**]{.underline}. A collision between a suddenly moving
foreign satellite and a mission-critical US satellite is neither a
coincidence nor an accident. But without attribution, it does not matter
that this is so obvious. Other forms of direct and indirect attack would
be traceable to an attacker, which could result in military, economic,
and political repercussions. In criminology we know that the major
consideration of a perpetrator for premeditated acts is the risk of
getting caught. The size of any repercussions if caught is secondary. If
a [cyber attack can destroy or disable **US satellites** with no
attribution]{.underline} or traceability, it [is likely to be
considered]{.underline} by those who are openly adversaries and
certainly by those who are covert. From a cyber warfare perspective,
[this creates an opportunity for a third party to hack and hijack a
satellite with the]{.underline} express [purpose of **colliding** with a
**mission-critical** US satellite]{.underline}. The attack could be
either a direct collision or an indirect attack using the debris cloud
from another collision. The ramming satellite can come from any country
or international organization. The easiest way to perpetuate this attack
would be to hijack satellites from countries less technically advanced
or from less-protected or outdated systems.

The **[Hypervelocity Eight Ball]{.underline}**. The [term hypervelocity
eight ball refers to the hitting of targeted satellites]{.underline},
directly or indirectly, [with the intent to destroy the target by
collision]{.underline} with hypervelocity objects. As previously
discussed, the [adversary can create a direct attack by
ramming]{.underline} targeted US [satellites]{.underline} with space
vehicles [through]{.underline} unauthorized **[cyber
commands]{.underline}**. The [target]{.underline} for the initial step
in an indirect attack [may well be another satellite]{.underline}, part
of a delivery vehicle, or space junk that will create significant debris
upon impact. The [collision creates]{.underline} hundreds or [thousands
of **debris pieces**]{.underline} that continue in space at high
velocity. The [debris cloud will affect other satellites]{.underline} in
the collision orbit [and]{.underline} may even [initiate the **Kessler
Syndrome**]{.underline}, causing [proliferating]{.underline}
[damages]{.underline} if the threshold is reached.

#### Debris blocks [space colonization]{.underline} AND creates a cascade of [satellite destruction]{.underline}.

[Space debris puts **exploration at risk**]{.underline}

Humans have now lived aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for
20 years (1). As we look toward the next 20 years, [we must address the
dangers that **space debris** poses to]{.underline} both manned missions
and crucial satellites. National policy-makers and international
organizations must develop actionable rules and regulations that
preserve [our ability to explore space.]{.underline}

With [tens of millions of pieces of **space junk** rocketing around our
planet]{.underline} at thousands of kilometers an hour, [debris is a
**substantial threat** to our]{.underline} expanding [networks of
satellites]{.underline} and even the ISS itself (2--4). The European
Space Agency (ESA) puts much of the blame on the failure to properly
dispose of expiring satellites (2). The recently signed Artemis Accords
similarly point to the value of "end-of-mission planning and
implementation \[and...\] post-mission disposal" in reducing debris (5).
With the [**rapid expansion** of]{.underline} the satellite **[orbital
population]{.underline}**---[many of which are relatively cheaply
produced]{.underline} with comparatively high failure rates (6)---this
problem will likely get much worse before it gets better.

Unfortunately, Cold War [cooperation led to rules designed primarily for
**nation states**, not for the corporations that are]{.underline} now
[launching]{.underline} literally [**thousands** of new
satellites]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the nation [states have]{.underline}
mostly [neglected to implement]{.underline} the necessary local space
[regulations that would promote]{.underline} the long-term
sustainability of equitable **[space exploration]{.underline}**. This
[tragedy]{.underline} of the commons [will damage the **space
environment**]{.underline} and eventually [impair]{.underline}
commercial **[space endeavors]{.underline}**. Space debris threatens
efforts ranging from the emerging mini-satellite mega-constellations
that aim to democratize internet access to space tourism. In a worst
case scenario, [orbital debris could start a **self-sustaining** cascade
of **destruction** that would litter the]{.underline}
**[L]{.underline}**ow **[E]{.underline}**arth **[O]{.underline}**rbit
[with enough debris to make it]{.underline} effectively

[Considering that **digital technologies are fundamental** to all six
of the space-dependent capabilities described above, none of them
is immune to cyberattacks. Moreover, any digital system that relies upon
near real-time information is vulnerable to cyberattacks. The loss
of one or more of these capabilities because of human or system error
or through **o**ffensive **c**yber **o**peration**s** conducted by an
adversary, could have **severe strategic, operational and tactical
consequences**. In order to understand the value of each space-dependent
capability, it is important to analyse the consequences
of cyberattacks on each.]{.underline}

[Cyberattacks on military weapons systems may have **operational and
strategic consequences** that change **the way the military operates
in conflict**. Although electronic warfare has been in use for more than
a century, sophisticated **cyberattacks on the systems of NATO** or its
key member countries have a new and distinct impact
on **decision-making** and on **how NATO conducts its operations**.
Cyberattacks on military systems could also have a paralysing effect
on strategic military and political decision-making and could render
NATO countries vulnerable to Russian or Chinese information
and deception operations.]{.underline}

Timing is a crucial element of PNT capability. Most of the electronics
used in military, civilian and commercial spheres depend on timing
signals. By intercepting securely transmitted data through cyber means,
an adversary may jeopardize the alliance's missions and services.
A compromised system would also diminish reliance on data received,
as data confidentiality would be brought into question through possible
acts of spoofing and deception.

[The involvement of Russia and the US in the Syrian conflict, and the
use of **electronic techniques, such as signal jamming, **and cyber
means, such as **hacking and spoofing**, demonstrates the potential
operational uses of cyberattacks. **Russia's electronic warfare
capability** involves not only an air defence capability but also
integrates **cyber operations**.]{.underline}58

[What type of consequences would result from cyberattacks within
space-based systems? What would be the **operational and strategic
impact**? The table below outlines some of the potential consequences
for each capability:]{.underline}

Table 2: NATO space-dependent capabilities and potential consequences
from their absence NATO space-dependent capabilities Potential impact
from the loss of capabilities Position, navigation and timing (PNT) •
Impacts on the civilian airspace, such as airliners losing on-board
navigation systems (which is not directly within NATO's purview, but
which would affect the scale of the conflict or crisis in general.
Moreover, an attack on civil systems could result in military
consequences). • [Losing contact with the alliance's forces and assets
during their deployment. • Loss of the time signal and its impact on the
functioning of warships and guided missiles. • Losing connection with
ships, aircraft, carriers etc. in conflict due to interference to their
navigation systems.]{.underline} • Loss of precise time to create
financial transaction timestamps as financial sector's internal clocks
rely on GPS. • [**Cyberattacks on the guidance mechanism of a weapon**
(such as a missile) that would result in failure of weapons delivery
accuracy]{.underline}. • Impact on the security of mission-critical
assets and mission assurance.59 [Intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance (ISR) • Interference to the ISR capability that leads to
faulty assessment and response to threats. • NATO could lose the
possibility to transmit ISR information over potential adversaries'
territory. • Loss of situational awareness in peacetime and at times of
conflict, resulting in faulty decision-making. •]{.underline} Loss of
battlefield awareness for the commander, thus putting the desired
operational objective in danger. • [Manipulation of ISR data through
spoofing attacks, which could cripple defensive systems by sending
falsified or excess information to decision-makers]{.underline}. Missile
defence • The loss of missile defence capabilities in peacetime due to
cyberattacks would diminish situational awareness on ballistic missile
launches in the world -- reducing intelligence on when and where a
missile is launched, and by whom. In times of conflict and warfare,
losing this capability may result in unintentional escalation. [• In
times of conflict, such a loss will **have strategic, operational and
tactical consequences for NATO** missions and operations. • Cyberattacks
on missile defence could occur in the form of spoofing, thus deceiving
the ballistic missile command system.]{.underline} • The inadequate
interception of the upcoming ballistic missile may result with civilian
casualties. Communications • [Losing communication systems or receiving
spoofed data, thus compromising the integrity of information received. •
Decision-makers (including presidents, prime ministers and senior
military cadres) may not be able to send the necessary orders down the
chain of command. • Decisions based on faulty information **may lead to
escalation** and decrease the threshold for conflict.]{.underline} Space
situational awareness • Loss of control or destruction of satellite
control systems through the targeting of those systems or of mission
packages by cyberattacks. • [Altering the orbit of the satellite or
'grilling' its solar cells by exposing it to high levels of ionizing
radiation.60 • Inability to detect, predict or assess space debris or
its re-entry, which could impact on life.]{.underline} • Disruption of
missions and all other space services, thus impacting on military
operations and on human life. Environmental monitoring • [Cyberattacks
on weather systems or on environmental monitoring systems may cause
problems in defence planning for an attack as the military rely on daily
weather information to conduct its operations. • Weather information is
fundamental for land, air, and maritime domains. Cyberattacks on weather
forecasting systems could impact on operational capacity.]{.underline}

[**Space-based assets** function as **force multipliers**, providing
**support** and **crucial info**]{.underline}rmation [during the
strategic]{.underline}, operational and tactical [levels of
war]{.underline}. According to the Allied Joint Doctrine for Air and
Space Operations, [space capabilities provide a **wide range** of
applications such as:]{.underline} [global]{.underline}, strategic and
intra-theatre satellite [communications]{.underline} (SATCOM);
[positioning]{.underline}, [navigation]{.underline}, and [timing (PNT)
services]{.underline}; [terrestrial and space environmental
monitoring]{.underline}; [space situational awareness]{.underline}
(SSA); intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); NATO Shared
Early Warning \[6\].

- Satellite Communications (**[SATCOM]{.underline}**): [One of the most
  **widespread functions** of satellites]{.underline}, either civilian
  or military, [is
  **telecomm**]{.underline}unication**[s]{.underline}**. SATCOM provides
  [support to]{.underline} C2 through its multiple
  [applications]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} the establishment of
  communications in regions with minimal or even non existent
  infrastructure; transmission of [intelligence]{.underline}; relay of
  messages and control of UVs.

- Position, Navigation and Timing (**[PNT]{.underline}**): The [**PNT**
  data provided by space-based assets are essential for]{.underline} the
  prosecution of **[NATO op]{.underline}**eration**[s]{.underline}**,
  [since they are used for **precision targeting**]{.underline};
  [tracking of]{.underline} friendly and **[enemy forces]{.underline}**;
  provision of precise timing which is also vital for the function of
  networks and accurate navigation of troops.

- **[Environmental Monitoring]{.underline}**: [Meteorological and
  oceanographic **data** collected by satellites are crucial to
  NATO]{.underline} forces [since they play an **important role**
  in]{.underline} the planning of [missions]{.underline} and the
  selection of the optimal weapons system to be deployed based on
  weather conditions. Also the knowledge of the conditions on the
  theater of operations allows forces to take advantage of them, for
  example the [prediction of **flooding**]{.underline} based on maps
  developed in Afghanistan [was used enhancing **military
  op**]{.underline}eration[**s**]{.underline} and provide humanitarian
  support \[7\].

- Space Situational Awareness (**[SSA]{.underline}**): [Space
  situational awareness is the knowledge regarding]{.underline} the
  [outer space]{.underline} environment, natural and operational, [and
  its]{.underline} effects [on]{.underline} **[NATO
  op]{.underline}**eration**[s]{.underline}**. [SSA]{.underline}
  applications [includes knowledge regarding]{.underline} the
  **[operational capabilities]{.underline}** and limitations of both
  allied and adversary space platforms; tracking of space debris;
  observation of space weather; tracking of adversary activities in
  outer space and detecting attacks against space based assets. [SSA is
  essential for]{.underline} the function of [satellites]{.underline}
  and the conducting of their missions.

- Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (**[ISR]{.underline}**):
  [Space based assets equipped with]{.underline} sophisticated
  [sensors]{.underline} [provide]{.underline} a host of
  [services]{.underline}, [such as **intelligence**]{.underline}
  gathering, including Signal Intelligence (SIGNIT); target information
  and damage assessment; warning of attacks and situational awareness.

- NATO Shared Early Warning (SEW): **[Dedicated sensors]{.underline}**
  onboard satellites [can detect]{.underline} the launch of [ballistic
  missiles and track their **trajectory**]{.underline}.
  [Satellites]{.underline} also [provide NATO with the capacity to
  detect **nuclear explosions**]{.underline} (Nuclear Detonation
  Detection System) [which is essential for identifying]{.underline} any
  [violations of]{.underline} international [treaties
  banning]{.underline} **[nuclear detonations]{.underline}** (e.g. the
  Partial Test Ban Treaty).

from new and upcoming **tech**nology, such as AI being increasingly
**implemented in space assets**;]{.underline} • Inviting outside
organisations and cybersecurity experts to provide expertise and
differing perspectives on the topic, such as through cooperation between
NCIA and Europol EPE. Conduct Mission-Specific Cyber SASC Risk
Assessments: • Ensuring knowledge on specific procurement and SC
environment around each mission, thus sourcing the materials to the
level of integrity required; • Moving from detective to preventive
third-party cybersecurity management capabilities; • Establishing a
formal programme through manifesting policies, governance, procedures,
tools, and processes on data sent to and received by any supplier; •
[Assessing NATO-procured ICT components, such as **hardware, software,
and services**; • Analysing **suppliers, suppliers' sources, and the
larger SC ecosystem**; • Dedicating specified NATO personnel to
effectively assessing and communicating **supplier risks to NATO's
executive leadership**.]{.underline} Chapter 7: Conclusion 71 Train
Cyber SASC Risk Management throughout NATO Exercises: • Including cyber
SASC risk management at least in every midsize to large NATO exercise to
support a forward-leaning, collective defence approach; • Facilitating
space asset CSCRM training for relevant stakeholder organization-wide as
well as for key suppliers; • Facilitating individual end user training
for each redeployment; • [Engaging **white hat hackers** to
**penetration test for possible vulnerabilities** throughout trainings;
• Continuous **phishing simulation exercises**, mapping upcoming **cyber
SC threats and priorities**, or tabletop exercises to determine key
stakeholders and their responsibilities;]{.underline} • Sharing training
and test reports to both the military and intelligence community and the
commercial sector. REGULATION Streamline Security and Classification
Levels: • [Implementing **formatting standardization** for eased **data
integration and processing**]{.underline}, e.g., agreeing on specific
SATCOM frequencies, software, timing formatting; • Streamlining
classification levels; • Streamlining strict clearances of staff and a
good operational understanding of interacting with commercial
representatives and users. Enhance Procurement Contract Requirements: •
[Creating a standardized public-private security framework for
NATO-specific SASC cybersecurity: o **Streamlining working language,
external and internal assessments**, incident reporting and
communications across all partners and entities, thus creating a
single-entry point for suppliers;]{.underline} o Adopting a
standards-oriented, streamlined supplier risk approach to CSCRM
processes; o Incorporating strengthened insurances, such as for data
privacy, into negotiations with suppliers; o Better monitoring progress
and operations via customer and supplier assessments to determine CSCRM
maturity; o Ensuring that contractors comply with military protection
standards. • Including mandatory reports of all space asset cyber
breaches, and guidance on prioritization and determination of critical
components and responsibilities; • Substituting Security by Obscurity by
Security by Design and Default; • Integrating or partially adopting
industry standards and procedures into supplier contracts: o NAS9933; o
DOD CMMC; o ISO 27001; o NIST SP 800-37; o NIST SP 800-53; o NIST SP
800-171; o NIST 800-172; and o US SPD-5. Chapter 7: Conclusion 72 [By
completely or partly adopting these policy recommendations, NATO would
strive to fully leverage the potential of its 2019 Space Policy and its
Declaration of **Space as an Operational Domain**. Additionally, this
would allow NATO to function as a formal and informal MS consultation
forum on SASC cybersecurity. This way, it would make **full use of its
broad collective MS portfolio, best practices and lessons** learned, as
suggested by NATO SG Stoltenberg]{.underline}. These findings are in
line with the assumptions of neoliberal institutionalist theory. As has
been shown, NATO and national actors seek to maximize their gain from
space assets to maintain relative power and the ability to deter. This
behaviour is enforced by commercial competition and innovation.
Throughout this thesis, this was proven by findings which align with
neoliberal institutionalist theory, thus highlighting that a) Lacking
cooperation between NATO as an international organization and its MS, as
well as commercial SC partners, hinders to find problem solutions and
create internationally binding regulations; b) Commercial
competitiveness spurred by the search for economic efficiency,
competitive advantage, and cheaper labour trades off security concerns.
Following neoliberal institutionalism, and aligned with above presented
policy recommendations, [**NATO's role** should be to guide and advise
MS in **resolving global political and economic issues**, to reduce
individual cost and uncertainty. Therefore, NATO should consider a shift
from regarding cyber SASC risk management from being 'nice-to-have' to
being **mandated and critical**. Doing so will ease **safeguarding of
delivery** and **integrity of NATO mission-critical data**, better
integrate **suppliers and manufacturers** along the **cyber SASC**, and
increase **transparency, responsibility, and liability**. Furthermore,
this will ease NATO to stay competitive, deterring and up to date with
**innovative tech**nology, enhancing **outcomes of NATO missions and
operations** to the best possible extent.]{.underline}

In February, Gen. Jay Raymond, the new chief of space operations and the
head of U.S. Space Command, publicly stated that two Russian spacecraft
were tailing a U.S. satellite. He said that Russia's behavior was
"highly unusual and disturbing." [On April 15, U.S. Space Command
announced]{.underline} that [Russia tested an
**a**]{.underline}nti**[-sat]{.underline}**ellite weapon. [Russia and
China]{.underline} both [recognize]{.underline} that [American
high-precision warfighting is dependent on space systems]{.underline}.
According to the U.S. director of national intelligence,
[both]{.underline} [Russia and China are developing capabilities to
destroy U.S. **sat**ellite**s** in all orbital regimes]{.underline} ---
[at all altitudes.]{.underline} [But, **unlike in the past**, the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is not on its own. It

During the Cold War, the United States and Soviet Union were the two
dominant space powers and both worked diligently to develop space
weapons. European allies, France in particular, decried efforts to
create anti-satellite systems. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the number of spacefaring nations has markedly increased. And, as the
world has become more dependent on space systems, attitudes about space
security have changed. [The **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates has [demonstrated its commitment to space
security through the revival of U.S. Space Command and the establishment
of the U.S. Space Force]{.underline}. Other countries have, too. France
and Japan, for example, have announced the creation of their own
military space commands. **[NATO]{.underline}** has [declared that space
is an operational domain]{.underline}. Now, [the **U**]{.underline}nited

[a]{.underline} long-standing [skeptical view toward]{.underline} the
European Union's ([EU) strategic autonomy]{.underline} (SA) initiatives
[in the space domain to embracing them]{.underline}. The article first

space. It then discusses how [the strategic environment has
changed]{.underline}, specifically [with NATO declaring space an
operational domain, the US **supporting greater interoperability with
European allies**]{.underline} and partners [within its National Defense
Strategy, Russia's growing threat to the Baltics]{.underline}, and
Europe's increased appetite to leverage space for defense purposes. The
article then recommends how [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [could embrace and further the EU's space
initiatives by **leveraging Washington's power within

**[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion, [and NATO could all
benefit from America's pivot in this burgeoning domain]{.underline}.

Introduction and Background

Over the past two decades, [the **E**]{.underline}uropean
**[U]{.underline}**nion [has taken significant steps to assume greater
responsibility in]{.underline} strengthening its security and [building
its defense industrial base]{.underline}. In 2016, the bloc codified
this effort in its "Global Strategy." Within this strategic document,
the European Union introduced the concept of strategic autonomy (SA) as
it relates to European security and defense. Although the strategy
recognized that NATO exists to defend its members---most of which are
European---from external attack, it stressed that Europeans must be
better equipped, trained, and organized to contribute decisively to such
collective efforts, as well as to act autonomously if and when
necessary.1 Since the European Union announced its SA plan, its member
states have aggressively collaborated on 47 new defense projects within
[the EU's Permanent Structured Cooperation]{.underline}
(**[PESCO]{.underline}**) [framework]{.underline} and process. 2 These
projects are largely focused in the areas of space; air; land; maritime;
cyber; training; logistics; and command, control, communications,
computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR). 3

Specifically within the space domain, the PESCO [projects aim to enhance
**space-based ballistic missile early warning** systems, military use
of]{.underline} the [Galileo]{.underline} Global Navigation Satellite
System ([**GNSS**), and]{.underline} [space situational
awareness]{.underline} (**[SSA]{.underline}**).4 For example, France is
leading the Timely Warning and Interception with Space-based Theater
Surveillance (TWISTER) project with support from Spain, Finland, Italy,
and the Netherlands. This project will enable Europeans to better
detect, track, and counter missile threats through a combination of
enhanced capabilities for space-based early warning and endoatmospheric
interceptors.5 France is also leading [the EU Radio **Nav**igation
Solution]{.underline} (EURAS) project. Belgium, Germany, Spain, Italy,
and Poland have a supporting role in this initiative, which [will
promote the development of EU military **p**ositioning, **n**avigation,
and **t**iming capabilities and leverage the GNSS public-regulated
service]{.underline}.6 Additionally, Italy and France co-lead [the
European Military Space Surveillance Awareness Network]{.underline}
(EU-SSA-N) project, which [calls for developing an autonomous, sovereign
EU military SSA capability that is interoperable, integrated, and
harmonized with the EU Space Surveillance and Tracking]{.underline}
(SST) [support framework]{.underline}.7 Together, [the EU-SSA-N and SST
will detect, catalogue, and predict movements of space objects and
debris orbiting earth and alert spacecraft operators in an effort to
mitigate the risk of collision]{.underline}.8 In another initiative,
Germany is leading Austria, Greece, France, Portugal, and Romania in the
Geo-Meteorological and Oceanographic (GEOMETOC) Support Coordination
Element (**[GMSE]{.underline}**) project that [will leverage data
derived from member states' meteorological, environmental monitoring,
and oceanographic **sat**ellite**s** to support military
**op**eration**s**]{.underline}.9 Finally, Spain is leading Germany,
France, Italy, Portugal, and the Netherlands in [the
Strategic]{.underline} Command and Control (**[C2]{.underline}**) System
[for]{.underline} Common Security and Defense Policy ([CSDP) Missions
and Operations project]{.underline}, which [will leverage satellite
communications and remote sensing to execute missions]{.underline} and
operations [where the **E**]{.underline}uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion
[takes a leading role in **conflict prevention**, peacekeeping
operations, and **crisis management**]{.underline}.10

These initiatives are clearly indicative of the EU's desire to assume
greater responsibility in the collective defense of Europe. One may
think the United States would welcome or even encourage EU member state
collaboration to enhance the security of Europe; however, for the better
part of 20 years, US administrations have largely met such initiatives
with reservations and mixed views. Pres. Bill Clinton took a firm stance
that EU defense initiatives must not decouple the United States from
Europe, duplicate NATO structures and capabilities, nor discriminate
against NATO members that do not belong to the EU.11 The George W. Bush
administration was also critical of such initiatives, while the Obama
administration was somewhat more supportive.12 In recent years, the
Trump administration has raised concerns that the initiatives may limit
US influence in Europe, harm alliance interoperability, and steal market
share from American defense contractors in the European market.13

Why Washington Should Support the EU's Strategic Autonomy

If the Unites States were to reassess the strategic environment, as it
pertains to the transatlantic alliance, the analysis may lead America to
reconsider its long-standing unenthusiastic position on the EU's SA
defense initiatives, particularly those in the space domain. Below, are
several reasons why it is an opportune time to embrace such initiatives:

NATO's Newest Operational Domain: Space

In December 2019, 29 heads of state and government from each
[NATO]{.underline} member state met in London. One of the key
deliverables of the meeting was NATO [declaring space a new military
operational domain]{.underline}---joining air, land, sea, and
cyberspace.14 With the declaration, NATO [will begin strengthening
capabilities in the space domain]{.underline}. According to NATO's
recently published military strategy, [NATO has no intention to put
weapons in space and does not seek to become an autonomous space
actor]{.underline}.15 Instead, [NATO will serve as a forum for allies to
**share relevant information to increase interoperability**
and]{.underline} to [ensure the alliance's **op**eration**s** receive
necessary support from national space capabilities]{.underline}.16

Although [some argue NATO is slow to respond to changes in the
operational environment]{.underline}, such [critics should consider
NATO's aggressive response to the]{.underline} burgeoning [cyberspace
domain]{.underline} before passing judgment. [In 2014, the allies made
cyberdefense a core part of collective defense]{.underline}, [declaring
that a cyberattack could lead to the invocation of the collective
defense clause]{.underline}, commonly referred to as Article 5, of
NATO's founding treaty.17 Moreover, [in 2016, the allies recognized
cyberspace as a new military operational domain]{.underline} and further
pledged to enhance the cyber defenses of their national networks and
infrastructure as a matter of priority.18 [Since then, NATO has created
cyber rapid reaction teams]{.underline} to respond to cyberattacks,
[established a Cyberspace Operations Center]{.underline} to adapt and
respond to the evolving threat landscape, [and integrated sovereign
cyber capabilities into alliance operations]{.underline} and missions.19

NATO, specifically the [EU member states within the
alliance]{.underline}, both collectively and individually, [have
unquestionably built capacity in a short period within the cyberspace
domain]{.underline}. These efforts have enhanced the collective defense
of Europe. Arguably, [if NATO were to build capacity and leverage its
member states' capabilities in the space domain **as quickly as it did
in**]{.underline} the **[cyberspace]{.underline}** domain, [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [could]{.underline}
indirectly [**further enhance the collective defense of Europe** by
welcoming, **shaping, and informing such initiatives** in a manner that
complements NATO's deterrence efforts]{.underline}.

#### Effective, integrated allied space operations deter attacks on space capabilities that risk nuclear war 

Kestutis **Paulauskas 20**, Senior Strategy Officer at NATO's Allied
Command Transformation in Norfolk, US, 3/13/20, "Space: NATO's latest
frontier,"
https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2020/03/13/space-natos-latest-frontier/index.html

A [major surprise attack]{.underline} by an adversary [on Allied space
capabilities could **significantly undermine**]{.underline} the
**[credibility of nuclear deterrence]{.underline}** (for example, [by
compromising the Alliance's ability to detect launches of
**I**]{.underline}nter**[c]{.underline}**ontinental
**[B]{.underline}**allistic **[M]{.underline}**issile[**s**). It
could]{.underline} indeed [be a precursor to **major global
conflict**]{.underline}.

[How to deter such attacks? Deterrence theory stipulates]{.underline}
two ways: **[deterrence by denial]{.underline}** (deny adversary the
benefits it is seeking) [and **deterrence by punishment**]{.underline}
(ensure that the cost for its action will be prohibitive for the
adversary).

The credibility of deterrence -- in either of its iterations -- rests on
a combination of 1) political resolve, 2) capability to inflict pain and
3) clear communication of said resolve and capability. It is admittedly
difficult to use space capabilities for messaging -- unlike aircraft or
ships. Showing off a tiny cube sat soundlessly orbiting in empty space
is not a very threatening message. It is also extremely difficult to
deny an anti-satellite attack. Moreover, some [countries like **No**rth
**Ko**rea and Iran do not have similar space capabilities that could be
held at risk, so a deterrence through a threat of symmetric and
proportionate punishment]{.underline} ("you take down our satellites, we
will take down your satellites") [is not a viable option]{.underline}.

In light of this conundrum, the United States has publicly adopted
cross-domain deterrence (in its National Security Strategy), which is
based on the idea of punishment: "any harmful interference with or an
attack on critical components of our space architecture that directly
affects this vital US interest will be met with a deliberate response at
a time, place, manner, and domain of our choosing."

Should deterrence fail, the best defence against an anti-satellite
weapons threat would be to go after -- through cyber or kinetic means --
the enemy's launch capabilities and ground control stations.

[Kinetic action produces debris, the ultimate deterrence to actual war
in space]{.underline}. Chinese and Russian investment in space
capabilities should make them also increasingly dependent on space.
[Because of space debris, space can be considered a realm
of]{.underline} **['MAD']{.underline}** -- [mutually assured
destruction]{.underline}. A war in space is effectively unwinnable.
[**Unless an irrational actor with anti-space capabilities** would
feel]{.underline} very [disadvantaged and desperate, and would consider
making space inoperable a victory]{.underline}.

[In light of the Alliance's space-related vulnerability]{.underline}, an
[**ever bigger focus** needs to be placed on **resilience and
survivability** of space capabilities]{.underline}. This can be
[achieved by placing more **sat**ellite**s** in orbit, developing more
multi-purpose **sat**ellite**s**, **involving more Allies** and doing so
in cooperation with commercial actors]{.underline}. Maintaining [a

### 2AC -- ! Russia/China Alliance

#### Existential war with China or Russia is a real threat -- especially if China can conduct cyberattacks on US satellites.

**Dean, '19** (Eric Dean, Future Readiness Officer at the Office of the
Chief of Chaplains, US Army. "Can the United States Wage Existential
Warfare Without Foundational Principles or Truths?" 03/25/19

For many Americans, the idea of waging existential warfare is the stuff
of dystopian films. In the years following the Second World War, the
United States emerged as one of two global superpowers whose ability to
exercise its influence and will was challenged only by the Soviet Union.
Since the fall of the Soviet Union, however, the [U.S. has maintained
global superiority---or dominance---in every domain of warfare, enjoying
a unique status as the world's only superpower.]{.underline} Over the
past three decades, the military prowess of the United States has been
largely without peer[, thus the notion of existential warfare is
inconceivable for many Americans]{.underline}. Further adding to this
collective American naiveté is the fact that the last time the United
States fought foreign forces on American soil was during the War of
1812, a time so far removed from the American conscience that it is
difficult to imagine. Though the United States has suffered isolated
attacks since then at Pearl Harbor and again on 9/11, the U.S. always
has taken the fight to its enemies in their homelands, sparing our own
the destruction and suffering war inevitably brings. Consequently, the
possibility of waging a truly existential war is difficult at best for
the average American to consider. The reality however is that [if war
were to break out tonight between the United States and]{.underline} an
alliance of [SinoRussian forces]{.underline}, [the U.S. likely would
lose]{.underline}. [In simulated wargames conducted by the RAND
Corporation, the U.S. continues to lose catastrophically against Russia
and China as its bases, warships, and aircraft are
decimated.]{.underline}1 RAND analyst, David Ochmanek, confirms that
there is no situation under current conditions in which the United
States emerges victorious in a war with Russia and China.2 With [Russia
touting hypersonic, precision-guided
**i**]{.underline}nter**[c]{.underline}**ontinental
**[b]{.underline}**allistic **[m]{.underline}**issile[**s,** the
repercussions of consolidating personnel and equipment under Base
Realignment and Closure, as well as staging large numbers of personnel
and aircraft on a few large airbases and aircraft carriers translates to
catastrophic loss of life and strategic assets within minutes for United
States forces]{.underline}.3 [China poses an equally devastating threat
to communication networks, effectively employing a superior
cyber]{.underline} and electronic [warfare campaign against U.S.
satellites,]{.underline} network, and communication systems.4 According
to Robert Work, a former deputy secretary of defense and wargaming
expert[, the U.S has wargamed cyber]{.underline} and electronic warfare
[in field exercises, but "the simulated enemy forces tend to shut down
United States networks so effectively that nothing works and nobody else
gets any training done."]{.underline}5 [Assuming U.S forces somehow were
able to organize and wage land warfare after these initial devastating
assaults, United States ground forces would not fare]{.underline} much
[better.]{.underline} According to another recent RAND study, both
[Russian and Chinese rocket systems match or outrange current U.S.
capabilities]{.underline}.6 Similarly, Russian field artillery outranges
anything currently within the U.S. arsenal.7 Thus the reality is that
[should the U.S. to go to war today against a Sino-Russian force, our
current forward-deployed and expeditionary-focused military forces would
be destroyed or severely damaged, resulting in the **Nation suddenly
finding itself in** it what would be an **existential war** conducted
under large-scale combat operation conditions]{.underline}.8 In addition
to the strategic and tactical disadvantages facing the U.S., the very
nature of large-scale combat operations in a multi-domain environment
where [battles will be brutally fought in mega-cities]{.underline}
creates a significant moral dilemma for American political and military
leaders. The expected [catastrophic loss of civilian and military lives
undoubtedly will result in enormous public pressure to develop
weapons]{.underline} and tactics to quickly end such a conflict,
positing that the achieved victory will justify the means.9

### 2AC -- No Solvency

#### Shifting NATO's space strategy from deterrence by punishment to [denial]{.underline} is [key]{.underline} to space deterrence. 

John J. **Klein and** Nickolas J. **Boensch 20**, John @ George
Washington University's Space Policy Institute, Nickolas is @ Bryce
Space and Technology, October 2020, "Role of Space in Deterrence,"
Handbook of Space Security, p. 111-126/BL

Because states derive strategic advantages from satellites and potential
rivals may seek to deny a state this advantage, [the concept of "space
deterrence" is a relevant concept for space powers. Deterrence by
punishment, compellence, deterrence by denial, and dissuasion are
important ideas in the formulation of a sound space
strategy.]{.underline} Taking the commonly accepted definition mentioned
previously, space deterrence refers to persuading a potential enemy that
it is in its own interests to avoid certain courses of activity in,
through, or from space. Regardless of the chosen terminology or
definition, what is ultimately important is that [there are actions that
can be taken relative to space that affect the decision-making of
others.]{.underline}

One of the most essential distinctions in deterrence theory is between
deterrence by punishment and by denial (Snyder 1961). Deterrence by
punishment concerns the threat of credible and potentially overwhelming
force or other retaliatory action against any would-be adversary to
discourage potential aggressors from conducting hostile actions.
[Deterrence by denial refers to the capability to deny the other party
any gains from the behavior that is to be deterred]{.underline} (Snyder
1961). This concept refers similarly to deterring an adversary by
presenting a credible capability to prevent it from achieving the
potential gains adequate to motivate the action (Krepinevich and
Martinage 2008).

A related but distinct concept is compellence, which involves convincing
an adversary to cease some current undesired action. Compellence is
often described as a direct action that persuades an opponent to give up
something that is desired (Schelling 1966). While deterrence has a
negative object -- it discourages unwanted actions -- the object of
compellence is positive. Effort is expended to force or convince an
actor to conform to one's will.

Both military and nonmilitary means are applicable when seeking to
affect the thinking of others to enable deterrence by punishment,
deterrence by denial, and compellence. Nonmilitary means equate to the
soft power, or the diplomatic, informational, and economic instruments
of national power (Nye 2005). Nonmilitary means can be used to affect
another state leader's thought processes -- whether reinforcing a
currently held view that is beneficial to the deterring state or
changing the view of another state's leadership or polities.
Consequently, a practical implementation of space deterrence may entail
political and diplomatic efforts, such as new international treaties or
agreements; multimedia stories presenting news in a favorable
perspective; and commerce and trade activities that increase one's own
economic influence or affect negatively a potential adversary or
opposing alliance (Klein 2019)

Deterrence by Punishment

A [deterrence by punishment approach in space is underpinned in the
belief that the threat of credible and potentially overwhelming force or
other retaliatory action]{.underline} against any would-be adversary [is
sufficient to deter most potential aggressors from conducting hostile
actions in space]{.underline}. Such a strategy should clearly convey the
capability and credibility behind the threat and communicate the
specific behavior sought to be discouraged (Morgan 1977). As part of its
broader space strategy, the United States seeks to deter attacks against
its satellites. The 2017 US National Security Strategy conveys that
harmful interference or attacks targeting US satellites will be met with
a deliberate response in the "time, place, manner, and domain" of its
choosing (The White House 2017). A US joint doctrine describes that,
consistent with the right to self-defense, the United States may utilize
its space assets to target the space capabilities of an adversary to
deter potential threats (Joint Chiefs of Staff 2018). Some [security
experts view that the punishment portion of the US space deterrence
strategy has been pursued and emphasized extensively, perhaps **to the
detriment of other approaches** to secure US interests in
space]{.underline} (JohnsonFreese 2017).

[Many analysts have identified challenges associated with implementing a
deterrence by punishment approach in the space domain. These include
establishing appropriate thresholds for retaliation for both non-kinetic
and reversible attacks on satellites, differences in severity due to no
loss of life when compared to terrestrial action, and having the
requisite attribution capabilities and processes.]{.underline} The
absence of explicit threshold that a state would retaliate against
complicates efforts to deter adversaries. Some policy makers question
whether non-kinetic and reversible actions are hostile acts or armed
attacks that warrant a military response (Harrison et al. 2017).
Reversible and non-kinetic actions on satellites supporting tactical
operations may be treated differently from large-scale kinetic attacks
on satellites supporting nuclear command or control or early warning
missions. However, between these extremes, [there is still a highly
uncertain boundary that complicates deterrence efforts]{.underline}
(MacDonald et al. 2016). Ultimately, what is considered an armed attack
or hostile act in space necessitating a retaliatory response will depend
on the broader geopolitical context.

[Another challenge for a space deterrence strategy is that attacks on
satellites typically are unlikely to result in loss of human
life.]{.underline} Consequently, hostile actions in space may be
considered by some polities to be less escalatory or grave as conflict
on Earth. The frequently used adage that captures this thinking is
"satellites don't have mothers." [This view may cause decision-makers to
view aggression in space as never rising to levels that would warrant a
military response, whether terrestrially or in space.]{.underline}
Moreover, because military actions in space are unlikely to produce
direct casualties, [there may be an appeal to turn to these activities
as tensions between competing states escalate]{.underline} (MacDonald et
al. 2016). Perceptions that hostilities in space are less severe than
terrestrial conflict can be discouraging to those hoping to deter
attacks against one's satellites.

Regardless, the thought that the non-casualty-generating effects of
space actions preclude a deterrent threat is unfounded. Article 2(4) of
the United Nations Charter describes the need to refrain from the threat
or use of force against a state's territorial integrity -- which may be
interpreted as a state's physical property. Self-defense and retaliatory
threats to deter a potential armed attack against a state's satellites
are then appropriate and justified. Upon further examination, one may
dispel a historical challenge surrounding space deterrence by
punishment: a hostile action against a state's space systems may still
be deterred by threat of retaliation, even if there is no loss of life.

Yet another challenge to effective deterrence in space lies in the
difficulty of attributing who or what caused a satellite to cease to
function normally. Military actions in space can produce various
effects, may be non-kinetic and reversible, and in some cases these
effects may be difficult to identify and attribute. [An effective
deterrent requires timely assessment of the event to orient and respond
appropriately. Operating at hundreds to more than 30,000 km above the
Earth's surface makes it difficult to physically inspect and track
satellites, thereby making determining and assessing damage an onerous
endeavor.]{.underline} The hostile space environment -- where satellites
face [solar activity, scorching and frigid temperatures, radiation,
electromagnetic activity, and an increasing amount of debris -- further
complicates efforts]{.underline} (Wright et al. 2005). Operators must
distinguish between intentional interference from adversaries and
interference arising from normal operation in a hostile environment.

Some authors argue that the difficulties associated with attribution may
be less worrisome than originally thought (Harrison et al. 2009). An
attack on a state's satellites unconnected to a terrestrial strategic
event is thought to be highly unlikely. Attacks on satellites will occur
following the terrestrial breakdown of general deterrence between
states. The source of an attack may be less nebulous than space
deterrence literature has declared, particularly if the attacking state
launches a coordinated attack on many satellites to try to gain command
of space early in the conflict. Drawing from this example, intelligence
gleaned prior to the attack may be a more meaningful method of
attribution than enabled by postattack space situational awareness (SSA)
assessment.

Regardless of this assessment, in the current context of the global
proliferation of counterspace capabilities, there will likely be ample
room for misperception and miscalculation in a state's leadership. This
necessitates robust SSA capability to address issues of identifying,
assessing, and attributing activities that occur in orbit. Greater SSA
capabilities allow a state to differentiate between intentional attacks
and malfunctions due to the satellite itself or the hostile environment
it inhabits, thereby reducing the potential for misinterpretations and
miscalculations (Sheldon 2008). Effective SSA capabilities will
necessitate knowing what on-orbit systems are present, along with their
location, capabilities, historical anomalies, operating patterns, and
intended use. Such information will facilitate those preparatory
measures needed to pit one's strengths against a potential adversary's
weakness. Because SSA is a global endeavor, information sharing
architectures must be designed to include ethe international community
and commercial industry. This means that much of the data and resulting
information provided through SSA systems should be releasable and
disseminated to many of those participating in the global effort.

Today's security challenges can complicate the implementation of a
deterrence by punishment strategy. While some security analysts assess
that thresholds for retaliation, differences in severity for space
actions, and ensuring a sufficient attribution capability may be less
problematic than many think, it remains to be seen whether this is
confirmed in practice.

Deterrence by Denial

Among many security professionals, [deterrence by denial is often
associated with the concept of dissuasion -- activities that seek to
influence the decision calculus of potential adversaries to discourage
the initiation of military competition.]{.underline} A strategy
incorporating [dissuasion seeks to convey the futility of conducting a
hostile act, affecting the confidence of a potential adversary's
leadership and causing decisionmakers to **not pursue a military
confrontation in the first place**. To be most effective, dissuasion
activities occur before a threat manifests itself. Some national
security professionals note that dissuasion works outside the potential
threat of military action as a kind of "pre-deterrence," because those
states dissuaded will not require to be deterred by
punishment]{.underline} (Krepinevich and Martinage 2008). [While a
deterrent that seeks to punish an adversary is tailored to **distinct
actions by specific actors at definite times**, deterrence by denial
commonly lacks this specificity and exists as a general deterrent, one
that **shapes the security environment** through a broad, latent
deterrent effect originating from one's reputation and
capabilities]{.underline} (Morgan 1977).

A deterrence by denial strategy for space seeks to frustrate or
complicate the adversary's plans by introducing greater costs and
reducing associated benefit. Over the past several years, there has been
a greater emphasis on the role of deterrence by denial in the broader US
space deterrence strategy. Rather than threatening retaliation against
the aggressor's satellites or terrestrial targets of value, a US space
deterrence by denial strategy emphasizes reducing an adversary's
incentive to attack US satellites (Vedda and Hays 2018). A potential
adversary may be deterred if it concludes that an attack in space will
be ineffectual in achieving the desired effect. Much of deterrence by
denial and dissuasion necessitates preparing for potential conflict
during peacetime. Because dissuasion involves discouraging the
initiation of military competition, for the space domain the requisite
peacetime preparedness is included within the contexts of space mission
assurance and resilience.

According the US joint literature, mission assurance entails a process
to protect or ensure the continued function and resilience of
capabilities and assets -- including personnel, equipment, facilities,
networks, information and information systems, infrastructure, and
supply chains -- critical to the performance of the Department of
Defense mission essential functions in any operating environment or
condition (Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland
Defense 2015). Similar to mission assurance but with a different focus,
resilience is an architecture's ability 116 J. J. Klein and N. J.
Boensch to support mission success with higher probability; shorter
periods of reduced capability; and across a wider range of scenarios,
conditions, and threats, despite hostile action or adverse conditions
(Joint Chiefs of Staff 2018). Resilience may leverage cross domain
solutions, along with commercial and international capabilities. By
definition, space mission assurance and resilience efforts can prevent a
potential adversary from achieving its objectives or realizing any
benefit from aggressive action. Space mission assurance and resiliency
help convey the futility of conducting a hostile act and, consequently,
enhance deterrence by denial and dissuasion efforts.

[Space mission assurance efforts consist of defensive operations, which
include]{.underline} off-board protection elements; reconstitution,
which includes launching replacement satellites or activating new ground
stations; and [resilience, which includes]{.underline} on-board
protection elements (Joint Chiefs of Staff 2018). Resilience in
capabilities includes [disaggregation, distribution, diversification,
deception, protection, and proliferation. Disaggregation is]{.underline}
the [separation of dissimilar capabilities into separate
platforms]{.underline} or payloads. [Distribution utilizes a number of
nodes, working together, to perform the same]{.underline} mission or
[functions as a single node. Diversification is contributing to the same
mission in multiple ways, using different platforms,]{.underline}
different [orbits, or systems]{.underline} and capabilities
[of]{.underline} commercial, civil, or [international
partners.]{.underline} Deception is hiding one's strengths and
weaknesses from one's adversaries. [Protection is utilizing active and
passive measures to ensure space systems provide mission support in any
operating environment or condition. Proliferation is deploying larger
numbers of the same platform, payloads, or systems of the same type to
perform the same mission.]{.underline}

[Space mission assurance]{.underline} may be supported by a number of
preparations preceding a potential conflict. These preparations [may
include hardening against cyber threats and signal jamming,
incorporating shutters for remote sensing satellites to minimize the
effects of dazzling by lasers, or increasing the mobility of satellites
through novel propulsion technologies]{.underline} (Kueter and Sheldon
2013). Preparations taken in peacetime may include [employment of
proliferated constellations of small satellites to complicate an
adversary's space ambitions.]{.underline} Furthermore, the conduct and
training of one's space and terrestrial forces may grant an ample
deterrent effect, even if no ancillary preparations have been made. One
method of frustrating an adversary's plans may be to train forces to
fight under degraded conditions where military forces lose access to
space-enabled capabilities, thereby depriving potential aggressors some
of the appeal of attacking satellites (Harrison et al. 2009).
Consequently, a potential aggressor may be convinced that the prospects
for success are too costly, with little benefit.

Another method of frustrating an adversary's space control plans is to
reduce one's vulnerability by transitioning traditional space-derived
services to terrestrial alternatives, a concept termed space avoidance.
Its advocates seek to increase space deterrence by minimizing one's
presence in space, thereby diminishing an adversary's perceived benefits
of attacking one's satellites (Coletta 2009). For example, some space
avoidance advocates suggest this may be achieved by using unmanned
aerial systems (UAS) for tactical reconnaissance systems instead of
remote sensing satellites. Creating redundancy through terrestrial
alternatives is prudent, but one should not be misled when judging
whether reliance on space can be abated entirely. UAS are a valuable
supplementary resource to space-derived intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (ISR); however, most UAS still require space-derived
positioning information and communications to operate. Many forms of
military power -- sea power and airpower, for example -- cannot easily
reduce reliance on space-derived services. While states should seek to
increase terrestrial redundancy to complicate an adversary's plans, a
strategy of space avoidance intending to greatly reduce reliance on
space is not feasible in modern warfare.

[**Alliances**, international cooperation, and the global proliferation
of space power also **play a significant role in deterrence by
denial**.]{.underline} This international dimension influences
deterrence in several ways. First, the proliferation of states operating
or deriving benefits from satellites creates stakeholders who would
likely prefer that their satellites were not put in jeopardy. [States
outside of the deterrence relationship may have their satellites
affected]{.underline} negatively if deterrence fails and conflict
ensues, [such as by orbital debris from kinetic attacks or the
indiscriminate effects of broad radio-frequency jamming]{.underline}.
Second, [the deterring state may provide a]{.underline} global or
[multinational space-derived service, such as the US Global Positioning
System satellites, which if attacked could]{.underline} potentially
[draw countries reliant on this service into the conflict on the side of
the non-aggressor]{.underline} (Harrison et al. 2009). In these
situations, [an aggressor may be hesitant to attack space systems if it
will have to potentially contend with an international
response]{.underline} (Sheldon 2008). Third, [allied or partner states
may assist the deterring state when a conflict breaks out. The space
systems of friendly countries can complement and supplement the
deterrer's own capabilities, such as through data sharing agreements,
interoperability, or even by assisting in the reconstitution of lost
space capabilities. Adversary leadership may be deterred from targeting
US satellites if they perceive that the United States could leverage the
capabilities of its allies to nullify any anticipated
benefit]{.underline} (Sheldon 2008).

Some [**security experts** consider the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (**NATO) as being uniquely positioned to bolster deterrence
in space** through its cooperative alliance. The alliance is
increasingly reliant on space for its collective defense and economic
prosperity, and an attack on the space assets of **any one ally**
impacts the security of all allies]{.underline} (Schulte 2012).
[Security experts assert that while NATO is dependent on space-enabled
capabilities, its space doctrine and planning have not kept
up.]{.underline} Presently, NATO officials are considering how the
alliance should address the growing military capabilities of Russia and
China, to include issuing NATO's first strategy for space. The strategy
is expected to make space an official domain of operation, giving
structure to discourse on military developments in space and NATO's
response. The alliance may also decide that attacks in space would
trigger the organization's Article 5 provisions on collective defense,
although internal differences on the subject remain. [Analysts have long
held that NATO should continue to build the expertise and capacity to
conduct operations enabled by space; ensure that doctrine, requirements,
and planning account for the operational advantages provided by
space;]{.underline} and adapt exercises and training to ensure forces
can effectively exploit space-based capabilities (Schulte 2012). It is
still uncertain whether NATO's space strategy will implement these
recommendations. A deterrence by denial strategy presents its own
challenges. The cost of fielding and launching the most robust,
defendable space systems can become a financial burden (Coletta 2009).
Hardened, dispersed, disaggregated, or diversified capabilities may cost
more to develop, launch, integrate, and operate. Also, resilient
architectures may not be able to match the performance of those
exquisite space systems. In most cases, smaller, proliferated
constellations of satellites will augment, rather than replace these
exquisite systems. The space strategist then must consider the benefits
of defensive approaches, along with associated time and fiscal
procurement costs, when finally deciding upon the best approach. Another
challenge of deterrence by denial is that one's space mission assurance
and resilience efforts must be widely publicized to be effective in
dissuading others.

**[Effective Communication Is Required]{.underline}**

Any [effort to affect an adversary's decision-making is best served by
**clearly communicating** one's desire, intent, **capability**,
credibility, and rationale for military response.]{.underline} This
requisite communication may be achieved through official statements or
policy documents or more importantly through a demonstrated history of
consistent actions (Klein 2019). [If the deterring state is not clear in
identifying]{.underline} the specific behaviors that it is trying to
deter and conveying the threat of what will transpire if an aggressor
chooses not to be deterred -- along with t[he defensive capabilities
mobilized to discourage them -- then the prospects for successful
**deterrence are diminished**.]{.underline} If one's deterrent message
is not received or comprehended, then it will be difficult for
deterrence to succeed (Schelling 1966).

In addition to the impediments in communicating deterrence in general,
[deterrence in space presents its own **unique challenges** that further
complicate it potential success. The remoteness of space, highly
classified nature of many of these systems, and perpetual concerns
regarding dual-use technology all contribute to an environment where
both sides of the deterrence relationship have limited awareness of or
insight on the others behavior and conduct]{.underline} (Todd Harrison
et al. 2017). Indeed, the dual-use nature of space systems can be
particularly troublesome when attempting to clearly comprehend or
communicate intent, because motive and intent are made more ambiguous
when a state fields dual-use capabilities that can be used for civil,
commercial, or military purposes.

Often in analysis of high-technology systems, capability is considered
equal to intent (Gray 1993). While China is often at the center of
debates over capability and intent, some security experts note the
United States fields many of the same dual-use systems that elicit
concern among its rivals (Johnson-Freese 2017). Intent is a frequently
subjective matter and dependent upon one's worldview. For example, the
Soviet Union viewed the US Space Shuttle program as a potential ASAT
weapon because Soviet military leadership thought the Shuttle was
capable of retrieving satellites and de-orbiting them (Wright et al.
2005). [Assuming a worst case of intent based solely on an enemy's
capabilities can raise the possibility of miscalculation and increase
tensions among states when potentially none may be
warranted.]{.underline}

NATO?"
https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/rusi-newsbrief/space-operational-domain-what-next-nato)

This is not to say that all NATO members will, or should, develop
extensive military space programmes. Not only is this not practical or
financially feasible for many but it also does not take into account the
other ways that states can contribute to a secure and resilient
collective space architecture. Space situational awareness (SSA), also
often referred to as space domain awareness
(SDA), [involves](https://spacenews.com/air-force-ssa-is-no-more-its-space-domain-awareness/) monitoring
the orbital environment, tracking satellites and pieces of debris,
assessing the threat of space weather and the actions and intent of
space actors -- in short, acquiring as full a picture as possible about
what is happening in orbit. It is an essential activity for protecting
space assets, but is still an activity carried out by relatively few
NATO members. [States without space capabilities can be involved in this
through developing their own SSA programmes or hosting ground stations
as part of existing programmes, as well as participating in intelligence
activities. These options would be particularly important should there
be a future requirement for **all member states** to **contribute to**
the NATO **space enterprise.**]{.underline}

The Alliance must also take into account potential future conflicting
priorities. One such possible scenario relates to the [increased
attention of the US on its interests in the Pacific, while significant
NATO focus remains on the threat posed by Russia]{.underline},
particularly in Northern and Eastern Europe[. Ensuring that assets are
available to monitor Russian activity in the High North or on its
borders is essential. Reliance on one or a few states for these assets
may not be sustainable, particularly if there is a hesitation to make
them available, and it may be the case that NATO will need to acquire
dedicated capabilities to carry out priority operations, either through
a national programme that is managed by NATO, or one similar to that of
NATO communications satellites.]{.underline}

It is clear that more work is required to ensure NATO space policy is
effective, both now and as new developments in space emerge. This is an
activity not just for NATO as a whole but for each member state
individually. For those with larger sovereign programmes, they must
assess the balance between their own and NATO's future priorities and
what effect this may have on their space assets, as well as their
willingness to allow others access to what may be sensitive programmes.
[For smaller states, including those without any space programme,
thought must be given to]{.underline} how comfortable they are with
reliance on others as well as [the ways in which they can contribute to
the Alliance's space policy, whether through deploying space assets or
involvement in space surveillance and intelligence. Simply being a user
of space, rather than an actor, does not negate the need for
participation in space defence and resilience. Every member state has a
role to play. Both NATO and space security are collective activities,
and neither can work without the participation of all concerned. The
next step for NATO is to develop a space strategy that does just
this.]{.underline}

First and foremost, whether or not [NATO should pursue its own
**indigenous capabilities** within the space domain]{.underline} is an
ongoing dialogue. This is not without precedent, as NATO still operates
its own airborne early warning (AWACS) and RQ-4D Global Hawk drones.
That said, it seems those arguing for a minimalist approach are winning
the strategy discussions. This is unfortunate for an alliance that
continues to evolve: [without its own **space capabilities**, NATO could
be relegated to **observer** status in a future conflict.]{.underline}

This leads to the critical issue of Article 5. The policy statement
says: "A decision as to when such attacks would lead to the invocation
of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on a
case-by-case basis." This leaves much to the imagination.

[Before]{.underline} the abortive "[**red lines**" in
Syria]{.underline}, such [guardrails were key in preventing the Cold War
from turning **hot**.]{.underline} NATO would do well to define these
for space sooner rather than later. Would an attack on a national
technical means verification (NTM) satellite trigger Article 5? What
about on a dual-use (those with both a defense and commercial use)
communications satellite, or even a purely commercial satellite internet
asset? [The alliance needs to clearly outline these to prevent
**miscalculations** by]{.underline} potential [adversaries]{.underline}.

Thirdly and finally, is [industry **engagement**]{.underline}.
[Within]{.underline} the [space]{.underline} sector, [the **majority**

chain [including launch services, satellite manufacturing, and satellite

[**NATO Industrial Advisory Group** and the **NATO-Industry
Forum**]{.underline}, which have seen only limited engagement with the

The Weaponization of Space: a Worrisome Trend

[Recent years have seen a growing **arms-race in space**, with nations
striving to develop and test offensive space capabilities, and space
force-building processes taking place within their
militaries:]{.underline}1 In December 2018, the US Air Force's National
Air and Space Intelligence Center published a report, arguing that [both
**China and Russia are developing space weapons**.]{.underline}2 During
2019 the US and France have established dedicated space commands.3 In
March 2019, India conducted its first test of an anti-satellite weapon.
The case of India, a country without a history of offensive space
activities, illustrates the magnitude of the space arms-race. [With
space becoming increasingly weaponized, the vulnerabilities of space
systems, initially built without basic or sufficient security
mechanisms, are becoming both apparent and dangerous, **render**ing them
exposed to cyber threats.]{.underline}

In December 2019, NATO foreign ministers formally declared space as an
'operational domain,' extending the alliance's range from land, sea, air
and cyberspace to operations in space. [Cyber threats to space systems
run the wide range from vulnerabilities in the physical ground and space
segments to the satellites' data links and supply chains. As **cyber
warfare and hybrid threats** become the '**weapon of choice'** for state
and non-state actors, and global economy and daily life grow
increasingly dependent on space, space systems may well become the
**next front in cyber conflict.**]{.underline}

This paper suggests a comprehensive approach to this threat landscape,
and offers integrated strategic solutions for the cyber defence of space
systems.

Existing Cyber Threats to Space Assets

Space systems are usually divided into three technological and
operational segments, which are responsible for different functions and
are therefore exposed to different cyber threats: the ground segment,
the space segment, and the link segment.

The ground segment consists of all the ground elements of space systems
and allows command, control and management of the satellite itself and
the data arriving from the payload and delivered to the users.4

Due to their role in collecting data, the ground stations and terminals
are exposed to the threat of cyber espionage from states and non-state
actors. Moreover, the military aspect of satellites and their importance
to national security render them prime targets for hostile takeover,
disruption and shutdown. Most cyberattacks on the ground segment exploit
web vulnerabilities and allow the attacker to lure ground station
personnel to download malwares and Trojans to ground stations'
computers.5

Infiltrating the ground station's network can allow the attackers to
access the satellite itself. Hostile access could enable the attacker to
execute a Denial of Service (DoS) attack6 and may involve taking over
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) in order to control the satellite and
damage it.7

[The space segment consists of the satellites themselves. **Major
security gaps** within satellites' architecture exist in both old and
new satellites. Old satellites with life spans of decades were built
with **no awareness for cyber security**; today, small satellites
manufacturers tend to prioritize **fast and cheap production**, in which
the investment in cyber security is perceived as a hurdle.]{.underline}

Cyber threats to space segments usually derive from vulnerabilities in
ground stations, in network components, and in the receivers which
receive the data from the satellite, thus allowing the attacker to
infiltrate to the network and remain undetected. Another threat may
involve the introduction of a malware into the satellite's hardware in
the supply chain, in order to compromise ground units at a later stage.8

[Consequences of cyberattacks on satellites could also be aggravated due
to the rising connection and use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. An
attack on a communication satellite could cause **wide disruptions to
communication channels** across countries, cause panic, and **endanger
national security.**9]{.underline}

The link segment consists of the signal transmission between the
satellite and the ground station, as well as between satellites.

The most common threat is GPS jamming. As GPS systems rely on radio
signals sent from the satellite in order to determine the location of
the users, GPS jammers send signals over the same frequency as the GPS
device, in order to override or distort the GPS satellite signals. GPS
jammers are widely accessible and cheap to purchase, rendering them
available also to poorer state-actors. In November 2018, Russia was
suspected of disrupting GPS signals in northern Norway and Finland as
the two nations participated in NATO's Trident Juncture exercise.10
Another type of attack is 'spoofing' -- faking signals by broadcasting
incorrect GPS signals, structured to resemble genuine ones. Spoofing is
harder to carry out than jamming, but if executed effectively, can be
much more dangerous, mainly because the victims do not necessarily know
that they are being spoofed. According to a 2017 US Maritime
Administration report, the GPS systems of at least 20 ships were
spoofed, leading the ships 32 kilometres inland to the Gelendzhik
Airport in the Black Sea, away from the original destination. The
incident raised assumptions among experts that Russia had been
experimenting new GPS spoofing techniques as part of its electronic
warfare capabilities.11

While some experts define jamming and spoofing as physical threats as
they involve disrupting or tampering with frequency signalling, an
attacker could also intercept unencrypted satellite traffic.

As cyber threats are becoming more substantial, the lack of procedures
and policies is hampering efforts to mitigate the threats. However,
several solutions have been suggested in recent years.

Threat Response and Mitigation

[Mitigating cyber threats to space systems can be divided into
**tech**nological solutions, which consist of introducing new
technologies as well as upgrading existing ones, and policy solutions,
which consist of actions and protocols of conduct.]{.underline}

Technological Solutions

In response to the rising cyber threats to space systems, many state
agencies, contractors and commercial companies have started developing
new technologies, or upgrading existing ones which were not secured by
design. In December 2018, Lockheed Martin was awarded a US Air Force
contract to modernize GPS ground control systems to support an
anti-jamming GPS signal named M-Code, which will allow the Air Force to
continue operating the GPS3 constellation with existing ground systems
until 2025.12 In January 2019, NASA announced that it would start
testing an open-source Blockchain platform in order to address potential
issues of privacy and to prevent spoofing, DoS and other attacks.13

In March 2019, Lockheed Martin announced it had developed a new
software-defined satellite architecture called SmartSat as a space
segment solution, which will enable more capabilities and greater
control of in-orbit satellites for ground operators. This architecture
is expected to gain operators greater precision in diagnosing problems
such as cyber incidents, as well as to allow satellites to back each
other up. Operators will also be able to update on-board cyber defences
to address new threats.14

[While the **tech**nological solutions being developed will mitigate
cyber threats, these tend to address very particular threats. In
addition, being provided by a host of different entities, these are
**difficult to bring together** within a unified, coordinated framework.
A **comprehensive problem** requires a comprehensive, unified and
systematic policy solution to guide the efforts to protect space assets
and services.]{.underline}

Policy Solutions

[As the military space sector increasingly relies on commercial
technologies, a comprehensive policy solution should focus on commercial
space companies and government acquisition contracts.]{.underline} A
possible solution which could include both civilian and military space
assets and activities would be [**introduc**ing strict cybersecurity
requirements for all components of space systems and their supply
chains.]{.underline} A recent example of such requirements is the
Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) which was introduced
by the US Department of Defense for all defence contractors, including
small vendors.15 [**A smart model system** which defines different
levels of requirements for different products and **tech**nologies would
demand a high-security level for **inherently vulnerable
products**,]{.underline} without imposing a disproportionate burden on
smaller companies. Such a model of cybersecurity standards should be a
threshold condition for bidding for government contracts. Additionally,
employing strict standards in government contracts is likely to usher in
changes across the whole industry, and will therefore help promote the
security of commercial and off-the-shelf technologies.

The Role of NATO

[NATO as an Alliance was founded for providing a collective defence and
cooperative security for its member states.]{.underline} So far,
research has suggested that the EU may prove a more suitable entity for
promoting new industrial approaches, due to its economic and regulatory
authorities.16 [However, NATO has an **important role** to play in any
inclusive comprehensive solution due to the **importance of the
US**.]{.underline} Any industry standards mechanism should include the
US space industry, as Europe's production relies heavily on US-produced
components and technologies which should endeavour to design for
trans-Atlantic interoperability17. [NATO's leading **role as a
coordinator** and mediator is crucial, as the **US is likely to resist
any standards** mechanism that would push American vendors out of the
European space market. NATO's role would therefore derive from its
position as a **transatlantic alliance with connections to both Europe
and the US**, and its ability to require common standards and compliance
across the alliance. As a unified standards mechanism should be agreed
by all member states, NATO could act as a **forum for negotiations**
between its member states and the industry, as well as between Europe
and the US.]{.underline} Discussions and consultations as well as
further research can take place in conjunction with NATO's Industry
Advisory Group (NIAG) and NATO's Industry Cyber Partnership (NCIP), as
final results would be incorporated into the NATO Defence Planning
Process (NDPP).

#### NATO is uniquely susceptible to and unprepared for [space-based cyberattacks]{.underline} because it relies on [individual member states]{.underline}\-\--urgent action is key.

\\\\SYang

[In 2018, Norwegian military and allied officials confirmed that Russia
had disrupted NATO's Trident Juncture exercise in Europe's High North
region by persistently jamming GPS signals during the exercise. China
has claimed 'the ability to use space-based systems and to deny them to
adversaries as central to modern warfare'. As the **dependence** of
military operations on space-based assets has **increased
exponentially** over the last few decades and space-based assets are
potential targets for cyber attack]{.underline}, the newly released
Chatham House research paper 'Cybersecurity of NATO's Space-based
Strategic Assets' suggests that [NATO should bring space more to the
spotlight. The research paper lists cyber threats to space-based
strategic assets and capabilities, analyses capability requirements and
gives concrete recommendations for ways improve the resilience of the
space-based systems]{.underline}.¶ Space-based assets as targets for
cyber attacks¶ [Strategic military systems depend on space-based assets
for the provision of data and for many capabilities, such as
positioning, navigation and timing (PNT), intelligence, surveillance and
reconnaissance (ISR), missile defence, communications, space situational
awareness (SSA) as well as environmental monitoring. For accurate timing
and navigation in PNT systems, NATO uses the global positioning system
(GPS) which is also well known and widespread in civil use.]{.underline}
ISR information and imagery is collected through surveillance and
reconnaissance sensors. Both systems are satellite-based. Unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) systems also rely on satellite-based
'beyond-line-of-sight' communication. These are only a few of the
possible examples. In addition to the abundance of capabilities, it is
noteworthy that the capabilities are also linked and therefore affecting
one capability may cause collateral effects on others.¶ [As explained in
the]{.underline} Space Threat Assessment 2018 [published by the Centre
for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), there are several
intrusion points for space-based assets: antennas on satellites and
ground stations, landlines that connect ground stations to terrestrial
networks, and user terminals that connect to satellites. This can result
in data or data traffic monitoring, inserting false or corrupted data in
the system, or even the permanent loss of a satellite. As with every
other technology, people have the potential to be the weakest link in
the cyber defence of space-based assets -- social engineering is an
important tool for the adversary.]{.underline}¶ Vulnerabilities¶ [The
research paper highlights some of the most important vulnerabilities:
use of **commercial companies**; '**back-doors'**; **dual use** of
satellites; and **supply chain security** of space
technology.]{.underline} Chatham House reports have touched on these
topics before. The question of supply chain was raised in the
Livingstone and Lewis 2016 report, which observed that there was no
coherent global organisation with regard to cyber security in space and
that existing approaches had only limited reach into the supply chain.
In this year's research paper, it is again stressed that when the supply
chain does not ensure that military security standards are met, [items
procured may **expose NATO systems to vulnerabilities**.]{.underline}¶
[NATO by itself does not own satellites, but is dependent on member
states. In case of need, NATO requests access to products and services
from the allies. NATO allies procure equipment and software, which will
be integrated into their national defence infrastructure. In most cases,
military and commercial assets are not separate. Therefore, NATO does
not rely only on military assets, but also uses commercial, civilian and
national or multinational assets for operations]{.underline}. Even
though commercial methods have proven to be effective, they are
accompanied by the inherent risk of lower security requirements. Data
exchange between civil and military sectors may cause extra
vulnerabilities. As most of the space-based capabilities are dual-use,
meaning that assets are used both for military and civilian purposes,
the Chatham House research paper recommends that operators 'apply
higher-grade military hardening and cyber protection specifications to
civilian capabilities that have the potential to be used in support of
military applications'.¶ [The research paper also highlights the aspect
of NATO's dependency on member states for communication capacity as a
possible source of vulnerabilities. NATO owns satellite communications
(SATCOM) ground stations, but no satellites; it is therefore highly
reliant on allies to provide space-sourced data, information and
services. In addition, ensuring the security of space capabilities is
mostly in the hands of the allies. This puts NATO into a position where
its main option to protect capabilities of vital importance is to
**encourage allies** to put effort into securing the **space-based
assets** and foster **cooperation** in **space-based systems cyber
security**.]{.underline}¶ Space as a domain of operations?¶ During the
Brussels Summit in 2018, the Alliance recognised space as a 'highly
dynamic and rapidly evolving area, which is essential to a coherent
Alliance deterrence and defence posture' and on 27 June 2019, it
approved new space policy. [As]{.underline} claimed by NATO's Secretary
General, Jens Stoltenberg[, the space policy gives guidance on
opportunities and challenges and is not about militarising space, but
about information sharing and increasing interoperability. The research
paper suggests that, in addition to policy, NATO needs to agree upon
space doctrine.]{.underline} While policy directs, assigns tasks and
prescribes desired capabilities, doctrine provides principles of how
operations should be planned, prepared, commanded, conducted, sustained,
terminated and assessed.1¶ This suggestion becomes even more relevant
when taking into consideration recent announcements by some NATO
diplomats about NATO's aims to recognise space as a domain of warfare
during the London summit at the end of 2019. This indeed would be a big
step towards focusing more on space-based assets and their
vulnerabilities. [Considering the current context, in which China and
Russia are increasing their presence in space, this action by NATO is
inevitable. Whether or not NATO claims space as a domain, adversaries
will nevertheless develop their aggressive capabilities, from cyber
operations to anti-satellite missiles.]{.underline} Therefore, it is
prudent to update the approach towards space and space-based assets to
face new challenges.¶ Yet, claiming space to be a domain of warfare
highlights legal considerations. The Chatham House research paper raises
a question from the cyber perspective: whether a cyber attack on a space
system has to have kinetic consequences in order to give grounds for
collective self-defence according to the Washington Treaty. This can be
supplemented with a question on whether causing kinetic consequences
that result in debris breaches the responsibility not to cause
widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment, as
stipulated in article 35 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva
Conventions of 12 August 1949.2¶ Another question raised is targeting
dual-use space technology in international humanitarian law (IHL). The
principle of distinction foresees the duty to distinguish between the
civilian population and combatants and between civil and military
objects. As in the case of cyber objectives,3 dual-use satellites should
be counted as military objectives, but would be subject to the rule of
proportionality and requirement to take precautions in attack.4¶
Conclusion¶ The Chatham House research paper makes recommendations that
more or less all stress the same things: [**NATO is highly dependent**
on space capabilities; space-based **systems are vulnerable** to cyber
attacks and will become more and more appetising targets for
adversaries; and NATO must **foster cooperation** and information
sharing between member states. Overlooking these aspects could undermine
the **credibility** of the information provided through the space-based
systems, which would in turn affect deterrence and strategic liability.
In the broader view, destabilising space-based assets would not only
affect military conduct, but also have **severe effects on civil
infrastructures**.]{.underline}

[Space systems, which include both **satellites** and ground stations,
as well as related space products and services, provide
**mission-critical information** both for NATO's member states and for
the alliance as a whole. **NATO relies on space-based assets for**
almost **all of its operations and missions**.]{.underline}^29^ [Some of
the critical missions that rely on space assets include: **defence of
NATO's territory** and the neighbouring regions; **peacekeeping**
missions; **humanitarian assistance and disaster relief**;
**counterterrorism**; and **conflict prevention**
activities.]{.underline}

[**NATO does not own satellites**. It owns and operates a few
terrestrial elements, such as satellite communications (SATCOM) anchor
stations and terminals. It requests access to products and services but
does not have direct access to satellites, **leaving it up to its
allies** to determine whether they **provide access to** their
**satellite capabilities**.]{.underline} NATO has established memoranda
of understanding with allies for possible use of space products and
services.

Originally, in the US, space systems used by the military were separated
from commercial and civilian assets in terms of their development and
operation.^30^ One of the reasons for this separation was to protect the
military structure against physical and cyberthreats. Military space
system safety and security requirements were also higher and more
stringent than in the commercial sphere (for example, requirements to
invest in survivability enhancement mechanisms in order to resist
jamming, or special design approaches for military space architecture).
In recent years commercial methods, for instance the capture and
analysis of satellite imagery, have been shown to be as effective as
military means. As a result, NATO uses a mix of military, civilian,
commercial, and national/multinational assets to conduct its operations.
The joint use of these assets, however, comes with an acceptance of
inherent risk, not only to the countries that provide such capability
but also to the alliance as a whole. In response, the European Defence
Agency, through its Governmental Satellite Communications (GOVSATCOM)
development programme, decided to build an intermediary class of
satellites between commercial SATCOM and military SATCOM, with security
requirements able to address the needs of critical missions, including
crisis management.^31^

[There is increased dependence **on space-based systems** in modern
military engagement. During the US engagement in Iraq in 2003, **68 per
cent of munitions** were guided utilizing space-based means (including
laser-, infrared- and satellite-guided munitions); this percentage had
risen sharply from 10 per cent in 1990--91, during the first Gulf
war.]{.underline}^32^ [In its operations in Afghanistan in 2001, 60 per
cent of the weapons used by the US were precision-guided munitions:
these included **bombs, missiles, and other weapons,** many of which had
the capability to correct their own positioning to hit the target,
**using space-derived information**.]{.underline}^33^

[This **dependency on space-based technology** has major implications
for **the way NATO conducts warfare** today, and how it will do so in
the future. For instance, in order to conduct precision strikes or earth
observation through the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs -- such as
military drones), systems rely on so-called '**beyond-line-of-sight'**
(BLOS) communication via satellites -- especially in times of crisis and
conflict, since ground-based line-of-sight communications are vulnerable
to physical attacks. Yet, **cyberattacks on space technology** or on
**the UAVs** may lead them to misinterpret commands, or to lose contact
with the command centre and **fail in operation.**]{.underline}

[NATO currently uses six space-dependent capabilities for its alliance
operations and missions:]{.underline}

- [**Position, navigation and timing** (PNT)]{.underline}

- [**Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance** (ISR)]{.underline}

- [Missile defence]{.underline}

- [Communications]{.underline}

- [**Space situational awareness** (SSA)]{.underline}

- [Environmental monitoring (**weather forecasting**)]{.underline}

[The core functioning of these six capabilities **for NATO operations**
includes:]{.underline}

- [**Providing communication** in **military operations and missions**,
  for instance between a commander and their troops;]{.underline}

- [Providing early warning, through **detecting** the hot plumes of a
  **ballistic missile launch** -- thus, increasing the time available to
  respond to an upcoming threat;]{.underline}

- [Providing a precise location for **targeted
  strikes**;]{.underline}^34^

- [**Providing imagery** of targets, in order to observe, detect and
  analyse their status (**situational awareness**);]{.underline}

- [Providing GPS for **weapon guidance**;]{.underline}

- [Providing timing for **secure communications**; and]{.underline}

- [Providing **space surveillance and tracking**.]{.underline}

The table below outlines the key roles for each capability:

**[\<\<\<TABLE 1 OMITTED\>\>\>]{.underline}**

Identification is another important capability that is used in the NATO
maritime domain for coastal tracking, and for identifying and locating
ships and vessels. Using automatic identification systems (AIS), data is
electronically transmitted between ships and the coastal stations. By
providing similar functions, AIS supplements and provides resilience to
maritime radar and is fundamental for avoiding collisions.^36^

[NATO's space-dependent capabilities have individual functions, as
described above. These capabilities are also coupled to each other, with
**complex cross-dependencies**, so that the **loss of one capability**
may have a **collateral impact on other capabilities**. For instance,
most of the assets that **transmit communications** to support command
and control **are also dependent on GPS** for timing and
synchronization.]{.underline}^37^ [Although there would be a number of
contenders for technologies of utmost importance to NATO missions and
operations, preliminary research indicates that PNT signals (which
utilize GPS) are a much-needed priority capability in almost all NATO
operations.]{.underline}

The issue of spacecraft vulnerability relates to certain basic facts of
orbital physics combined with the relative transparency of space to
radar, optical, and infrared observation. 6 These conditions make
spacecraft liable to tracking by even amateur astronomers with only
moderately sophisticated equipment, which is easily obtainable by any
entry-level space power. While more complex guidance technology is
required for actual attacks on space assets and a global network of
radars is needed for conducting post-attack assessments of damage done,
the ability of even moderately advanced space powers to conduct
significant counterspace activities is not in question. [Thus far, only
Russia, the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [and China
have tested kinetic capabilities, but a number of]{.underline} other
[countries (including Iran) have carried out lesser forms of electronic
interference]{.underline}. As a major space assessment conducted by
NATO\'s Joint Air Power Competence Centre in 2009 reported on some of
the current vulnerabilities faced by the alliance in space:

[There are real and credible threats to Space systems]{.underline}. The
[ground systems are vulnerable to attack. There has been demonstrated

exists for ground-based laser weapons, electro-magnetic pulse, and
co-orbital ASAT weapons]{.underline}. Additionally, [there are risks of
collision from Space debris and impacts from solar events]{.underline}.
There have been many instances of satellite telecommunications
interference and piracy.7

Space assets are also threatened by a field of orbital space debris that
is steadily growing due to the increase in human space activity and the
inability of space to \"clean\" itself quickly. Depending on the
altitude of the orbit, it can take years, decades, or centuries for
pieces of space debris to deorbit. In the meantime, these particles
(even as small as 1 centimeter) represent 18,000 miles-per-hour speeding
bullets, which can destroy solar cells and cause often fatal damage to
any spacecraft that are unfortunate enough to cross their paths.8
Today\'s space environment is also characterized by an expansion in the
number of civil, commercial, and military space actors, making
international agreements more difficult than in the past.

[In the face of these risks and]{.underline} evidence of both [expanding
military space programs and weapons test programs]{.underline} in
several countries, [the response by many U.S. military
leaders]{.underline}, elected officials, and even experts [is **still a
traditional call for exclusively national action** to \"defend\" U.S.
assets in space]{.underline}. To take just one U.S. example, Senator Jon
Kyl (Rep., Arizona) stated after the 2007 Chinese ASAT test that the
United States must deploy a fleet of space-based weapons to defend
itself in space.9 He made no mention of the threat China posed to other
allied nations or their possible contributions to the U.S. response.

Historical conditions of anarchy in the international system have
contributed to a tendency among leaders to conceive mainly of national
responses to international threats. States are already organized for
national defense, [countries are jealous of spending scarce resources in
potentially risky ventures with foreigners (even allies]{.underline}),
and there are relatively low levels of trust regarding the reliability
of international organizations. [But three factors have altered global
dynamics]{.underline} in the last few decades, each of [which has an
important space component that supports the creation of an allied
approach to space]{.underline}.

First, the [scale of multinational interactions to deal with shared
problems is increasing due to the growing \"finiteness\" of the
globe]{.underline}, as the world\'s population continues to expand and
as communications technologies become more intrusive and more
widespread. Indeed, the very nature of the problems countries are facing
is changing as the Earth becomes \"smaller\": almost all free land and
airspace (up to 100 kilometers) have been claimed by nations (or
otherwise allotted by international law), the sheer scale of industrial
pollutants is beginning to have global effects, and such resources as
clean air and water are becoming increasingly scarce. Other problems,
such as climate change, are becoming recognized as requiring an
international response. Despite its comparative vastness, [near-Earth
space]{.underline} faces some of the same risks of growing human
activity, particularly due to the finiteness of its main, usable
resources (geo-stationary orbital slots, radio frequencies available for
broadcasting, and safe access to low-Earth orbit). All of these
[resources are becoming stressed by increasing human space
activity]{.underline}.

Second, and related, [economic globalization is an increasing
fact]{.underline} of life. Unlike during the Cold War, when the world
was dominated by two, nearly self-sufficient blocs, changes in the
international economic system (due to both political and technological
factors) has made commercial exchange possible across almost all
political boundaries, vastly increasing global trade. [Interdependent
economic relationships are the rule in **U.S. ties with our
NATO**]{.underline} and Asian **[allies]{.underline}** and even, in some
areas, with commercial partners like Russia and China. Similar to many
industries, [the commercial space industry has become truly
international]{.underline} and now generates \$161-billion in sales, 10
making it a valuable resource for both national governments and the
global economy more generally. Technologies built in one country are
frequently owned and marketed by another and are sold to clients in yet
another. Strong corporate alliances have already been formed in the
space industry, for example, linking Russian rocket motors with U.S.
launch vehicles (International Launch Services) and U.S. sub-orbital
flight technology with British funding and marketing (Virgin Galactic).
With some offshore corporations like Intelsat, it is often diflicult to
tell which individual country a space enterprise actually \"belongs\"
to. National militaries are also purchasing bandwidth on a large number
of commercial satellites, causing the breadth of a country\'s \"critical
assets\" to expand. Some of these assets are already shared with other
nations, although not in a joint operational sense. [Yet devoted
military space cooperation between countries remains highly restricted
and out of step with these integrationist tends]{.underline}.

Third, [in military affairs, **questions of international legitimacy**
are placing a growing emphasis on the need to **conduct operations via
coalitions**]{.underline}. Put simply, the unilateral use of force is
seen as increasingly unacceptable within the international community.
Largely for this reason, the United States fought under a U.N. mandate
in 1991 in the Gulf War against Iraq\'s intervention into Kuwait and in
Libya in 2011; it fought under a NATO mandate in the Balkans and now in
Afghanistan; and it fought (less \"legitimately\" from the perspective
of the rest of the world) with an ad hoc coalition of friends and allies
in 2003 in Iraq. Indeed, there is a growing literature on the need for
some international approval even for humanitarian interventions by
military forces in the modern era.11 Ironically, [given these pressures
to cooperate in military activity, **space remains an
outlier**]{.underline}. Unfortunately, the U.S. military has found by
experience in Afghanistan that national barriers have impeded its
effective use of space-derived data. As a one recent analysis of the
problem of information-sharing in Afghanistan observes: \"secrecy often
keeps coalition team members from speaking about space-related topics
with each other.\"12

But these points raise a critical \"process\" question: How do countries
come to realize that their security needs in an area of activity have
crossed the line from national to international? Realist political
theory argues that security, by its very nature, is something that falls
to states, as the essential building blocks of the international system
and the repositories of sovereignty within it. Yet space is an area
specifically delineated as beyond national sovereignty by international
law in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. The [failure of states to expand
collective governance mechanisms more in regard to space may be a factor
of habit, perspective, and inertia, plus normal bureaucratic opposition
to negotiations aimed at creating new, specialized institutions beyond
national control]{.underline}.

[Recent threats to U.S. space assets have been viewed as national
security threats because there is a long U.S. tradition of
self-reliance]{.underline} in international relations [and a perspective
that successful collective action is rarely achieved. But, in space, all
countries have an interest in protecting the environment from military
threats and]{.underline}, in fact, [from any obstacles to either free
access or free passage. These conditions create **fundamental incentives
for collective action** that do not exist in other areas of
international relations]{.underline}. Ironically, [one of the primary
obstacles to enhanced collective action to protect space security may be
the thinking of the actors themselves]{.underline}, which still remains
largely rooted in the unilateral traditions of security provision from
past security frameworks. But, as Robert Keohane argues, \"To pursue
self-interest does not require maximizing freedom of action. On the
contrary, intelligent and farsighted leaders understand that attainment
of their objectives may depend on their commitment to institutions that
make cooperation possible.\"13 **[Working with allies]{.underline}**,
therefore, **[may represent the best security solution
available]{.underline}** at this point [in space history,
and]{.underline} perhaps **[may serve as a bridge to broader forms of
international cooperation]{.underline}** in the future. [Alliance-based
efforts could mitigate a variety of emerging space-related security
concerns]{.underline}. The [prior existence of allied military
institutions- **particularly established patterns of cost-sharing,
integration, joint operations, and joint training**]{.underline}- both
[in the case of **NATO**]{.underline} and in various bilateral
arrangements with Asian countries (such as Australia, Japan, and South
Korea) [should reduce typical collective action problems in forming such
new mechanisms for space]{.underline}.

# 2AC -- DA

## AT: Ambiguity DA

### 2AC -- Ambiguity Bad

#### Ambiguity fails -- escalates probing to find red lines and undermines NATO deterrence 

Whitney L. **Cissell 20**; MA thesis in Security Studies, Naval
Postgraduate School, Army Major, Nuclear Nonproliferation Officer, March
2020, \"DETERRENCE IN THE DANGER ZONE: HOW THE UNITED STATES CAN DETER
RUSSIAN GRAY ZONE CONFLICT\", https://calhoun.nps.edu/handle/10945/64844

The stability--instability paradox applies to the nuclear and
conventional level, and indeed, Russia's effort to avoid
conventional-level warfare with the United States strengthens stability
between the states at the conventional level similar to the strategic
nuclear level. While U.S.--Russian nuclear stability is based on parity,
conventional stability in this relationship is more complex. As shown in
Chapter II, Russia has a strong aversion to conflict with the United
States and NATO at the conventional level. Russia would be outmatched in
military superiority after two to three weeks of conflict and beyond its
near abroad and, thus, prefers to operate at the sub-conventional level
below the threshold of armed conflict.227 In effect, Russia's strategy
of avoiding any actions that might trigger conventional conflict aims to
bolster a sort of "firewall" between conventional warfare and gray zone
conflict. NATO, up to now, has effectively obliged this Russian strategy
by not brandishing threats of conventional escalation in response to
Russian gray zone aggression, let alone undertaking conventional
responses. [As much as Russia seeks **to avoid escalation** to
conventional warfare it could not win, it is also learning **how averse
NATO is** to **threaten such escalation**. This aversion is
**ironic**]{.underline} insofar as Cold War--era extended deterrence
relied on NATO's threat of escalatory nuclear responses to conventional
attacks.

[These respective]{.underline} [Russian and NATO postures **enhance
conventional stability**]{.underline}, [but at the **cost** of **fueling
instability**]{.underline} [at the **gray zone level**]{.underline},
[reflecting a form of the stability-- instability paradox familiar in
nuclear strategies]{.underline}. This tailored application of the
stability-- instability paradox to the specific Russian context yields a
tiered relationship of stability between the United States and Russia at
each level of warfare, as depicted in Figure 1, and helps explain why
the United States and Russia are the most unstable at the
subconventional level, on which this research focuses.

Cumulative deterrence may be an option to address the issues created
when adapting conventional deterrence to the sub-conventional level
including the credibility and communication of the threat. Cumulative
deterrence has not been a standard element of U.S. deterrence strategy
in the past, and there is limited academic literature and strategic
thought about its use in areas outside of cyber and terrorism. However,
this [new security environment characterized by great power competition
at levels **below open conflict**]{.underline} [requires a **new
way**]{.underline} [of looking at the deterrence landscape at
the]{.underline} **[sub-conventional level]{.underline}**. [Subject
matter experts for this research confirm]{.underline} that [a
**zero-tolerance** deterrence mindset **will not work** at the
sub-conventional level and that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [might have to **choose what portions of the gray
zone it wants to deter because it may be difficult to deter
everything.**]{.underline}229

There is a precedent for applying a cumulative model and mindset of
deterrence to limit and shape the sub-conventional level of conflict,
and this suggests it may also be applied to the current U.S. need to
deter Russia's gray zone conflict. According to Thomas Rid, [cumulative
deterrence "consists of a series of acts of force to
create]{.underline}---[and maintain]{.underline}--- [general **norms of
behavior**]{.underline} [for many political actors over an **extended
period**. Using force,]{.underline} consequently, [does **not**
represent a principal **failure of deterrence**]{.underline} [but its
**maintenance** through **swift**]{.underline},
**[certain]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline} **[measured]{.underline}**
[responses]{.underline}."230 Cumulative deterrence has been a key part
of Israel's strategy for decades and was developed in the conventional
and subconventional level focusing on limiting and shaping ongoing
conflicts against both state and non-state actors at the conventional
and sub-conventional level.231 In addition, cumulative deterrence has
recently been considered for use in deterring terrorism and
cyberattacks, as it is designed for long-term sustained conflict, such
as competition in the gray zone.232

Doron Almong describes cumulative deterrence as functioning on two
levels: the macro, which creates an image of overwhelming military
superiority, and the micro, which relies on responses to adversarial
actions.233 Almong also explains that cumulative deterrence has three
key features.

First, its effectiveness is measured in terms of the number of victories
accumulated over the duration of the conflict, which might be envisioned
as "assets in a victory bank." Second, over time, these victories
produce increasingly moderate behavior on the part of the adversary and
a shift in its strategic, operational, and tactical goals until there is
a near-absence of direct conflict. Third, this moderation may eventually
result in political negotiations and perhaps even a peace agreement.234
Almong is describing cumulative deterrence as applied to the
conventional level of warfare; however, in the context of Russia, the
construct can be transposed to the subconventional level. [At the
sub-conventional level, U.S. responses over time to Russian gray zone
aggression could **moderate Russian behavior**, causing a **shift** in
Russia's **decision calculus** and **strategic goals,** thereby
**diminishing the conflict**.]{.underline}

The advantage of layering a strong conventional deterrence strategy with
cumulative deterrence is that it allows the restoration of deterrence
over time if conventional threats fail to deter at the sub-conventional
level. **[Over time]{.underline}**, [cumulative deterrence responses to
gray zone actions **bolster the credibility**]{.underline} [of the
United States and **alter Russia's decision calculus**]{.underline} [at
the sub-conventional level, therefore **strengthening deterrence
overall**. **Successful deterrence** at the **sub-conventional level**
requires a **reorientation**]{.underline} [in how the U.S. **views
deterrence**]{.underline}, [moving from a **zero-tolerance strategy** to
the **long-term** attrition of gray zone conflict]{.underline}. [This
renewed mindset allows for **tailored** punitive]{.underline}
[strategies that **over time** **limit the bounds**]{.underline} [of the
gray zone through the **reiteration** of **unacceptable
behavior**]{.underline} through punishment. Regardless of the level at
which a state wishes to conduct warfare, all deterrence strategies rely
on three aspects that must work in concert: sufficient capabilities,
solid credibility, and strong communication of a threat.235 As Rid
explains, [confrontations should be "seen as necessary evils that should
be kept on **as low a level as possible**, **but that could not be
pushed down to zero**]{.underline}."236 This argument assumes escalation
control, which is to say that the United States can control escalation
at the sub-conventional level on its own terms.

Many authors challenge the notion of escalation control, claiming that
it is risky and nearly impossible. Scholars claim that avoiding
escalation requires deterring the action and that a policy to deter one
action could in fact risk escalation to another. Additionally, scholars
claim, "Escalation control or management is an inherently imperfect
business. It can be done well or poorly, but it is extremely rare for
any set of policies to eliminate the risk of significant escalation
altogether."237 These same scholars agree that the risk of inadvertent
escalation can be reduced, but they are concerned that policy makers are
incorrectly assuming it can be eliminated altogether.238 The concerns
over escalation control are valid; however, it is possible to control
escalation and use the threat of escalation to bolster deterrence.
Mazarr explains that the gray zone puts the defender in the position to
escalate, which is part of the challenge of deterrence.239 Both
escalation control and deterrence fundamentally rely on communication
and a thorough understanding of the adversary. Proper communication of
the capability and the resolve to use the capability to deny or punish
an action are just as crucial to escalation control as they are to
deterrence. The same scholars who express concerns over escalation
control also admit there is a way to control the risk: "Escalation
depends heavily on an astute understanding of how the adversary will
perceive and interpret events that have not yet occurred---not only in a
general sense, but also under the specific and often
difficult-to-predict conditions that will shape the opponent's
perceptions and responses when a particular event occurs."240 The United
States can both mitigate escalation and contribute to deterrence by
adding an element of ambiguity to its deterrence threats that leave
something to chance but also allow a response that limits or controls
the escalatory response of the adversary.

When the United States responds with an instrument of state power in any
DIME category, such as the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats in response
to the Russian nerve agent attack on a British citizen in 2018, it can
strengthen cumulative deterrence credibility. Some of the literature on
cumulative deterrence suggests that deterrence works by banking "wins"
by responding to events with military power. However, when adapted to
the gray zone, it seems critical that all elements of state power must
be utilized, not just the military[. The military is
**sometimes**]{.underline}---**[not always]{.underline}**---[an
appropriate response to an action in the gray zone]{.underline}, [so
threatening military retaliation for]{.underline} [**every tactic** in
the gray zone is **not credible**]{.underline}; however, a state must
still have the ability to impose costs on an adversary for an action to
make cumulative deterrence successful.

### 2AC -- Article IV Solves

#### Shift to Article IV solves\-\--creates space for discussion and reserves Article V for large-scale attacks

John R **Deni 19**; Research Professor of Joint, Interagency,
Intergovernmental, and Multinational Security Studies at the US Army War
College's Strategic Studies Institute; November 1^st^, 2019 "The Paradox
at the Heart of NATO's Return to Article 5".
<https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/rusi-newsbrief/paradox-heart-natos-return-article-5>

However, in several important aspects, the Alliance response remains
handicapped. [Although NATO declared in 2016 and again in 2018 that it
could consider a hybrid attack as grounds to invoke Article 5, the bar
seems high]{.underline} -- perhaps [impossibly so. Achieving
**consensus**]{.underline} -- and **[quickly]{.underline}** -- in the
face of an ambiguous attack or in response to ostensibly unrelated
low-level provocations [will not be]{.underline} an [easy]{.underline}
task. Perhaps more importantly, NATO remains in a defensive crouch when
it comes to grey-zone challenges -- Alliance rhetoric, exercises and
actions emphasise response and reaction. It is precisely for this reason
that grey-zone challenges against NATO are likely to be effective --
[actors such as Russia and China are]{.underline} evidently
**[undeterred]{.underline}** by the Alliance's defensive posture, [and
attacks on Western institutions **continue**]{.underline} to this day.
To be clear, defence is important, but in the current international
security environment, offense and the competitive actions in between the
two are equally important.

Given the arguably inadequate Alliance response to date, some guideposts
may be helpful to illuminate the path ahead as NATO attempts to ensure
collective defence remains robust into its eighth decade. First,
[**Article 5 is an imperfect tool** for determining when and where the
West must spend blood and treasure]{.underline} in defence of its
interests and way of life. [Despite Alliance rhetoric regarding hybrid
warfare as a potential Article 5 trigger, the **threshold for
Alliance-wide action is too high**, and adversaries]{.underline} like
Russia and China **[know it]{.underline}** -- [this is why they pursue
grey-zone tactics]{.underline} in the first place. [To facilitate the
**speedy response** that will be necessary]{.underline} to meet the
needs of Allied defence against grey-zone challenges,
[greater]{.underline}, routine [use can be made of **Article
4**]{.underline} and Alliance-wide consultations and coordination on
issues and topics that go beyond conventional military operations that
are NATO's bread and butter. For instance, [the Alliance can and should
conduct more]{.underline} vigorous, regular
**[consultations]{.underline}** and intensified coordination on topics
such as keeping Chinese investment out of sensitive
information-technology and logistics sectors, limiting and rolling back
Russian broadcast and print media penetration of Western markets,
undermining the Kremlin's and Putin's trustworthiness within Russia, and
exposing Russian and Chinese official corruption at home and abroad,
[all as mechanisms to compete and thereby **strengthen collective
defence**.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Cyber Popular/Thumper

#### Cyber Workforce Program Act and State and Local Government Cybersecurity Act both thump and prove cybersecurity is bipartisan

Stephen **Silver 6/23**, technology writer for the National Interest,
6/23/2022, "Cyber in Focus: Biden Signs Pair of Bipartisan Cybersecurity
Bills", National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/techland-when-great-power-competition-meets-digital-world/cyber-focus-biden-signs-pair

[This week, President Biden signed a pair of new bipartisan
cybersecurity bills into law. According to The Hill, the bills are the
Federal Rotational Cyber Workforce Program Act]{.underline} and the
State and Local Government Cybersecurity Act. The [two bills
were]{.underline} generally [**noncontroversial** and **passed**
**without**]{.underline} much vocal [**opposition** from members of
either party.]{.underline}

[In May, Biden issued]{.underline} an executive [order on
**cybersecurity**, titled Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity. The
president also **thanked** the **bipartisan** **sponsors** of the
legislation.]{.underline}

The [first bill, the Federal Rotational Cyber Workforce Program
Act,]{.underline} took something of a circuitous route to the
[president's desk.]{.underline} It passed the House back in 2019, during
the previous Congress, and was reintroduced in April of 2021, before
passing via unanimous consent in December. After passing the House via a
voice vote in May, the bill was signed by the president this week.

[According to The Hill]{.underline}, the rotational [bill "establishes a
program to allow **cybersecurity** **professionals** to
rotate]{.underline} through [multiple federal agencies and enhance their
expertise]{.underline}," while also requiring the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) to "distribute lists of open positions in the program
to government employees annually."

The second bill, the [State and Local Government Cybersecurity Act, is
meant to improve communications between the Department of Homeland
Security and state and local governments on the issue of cybersecurity.
I]{.underline}t also requires the National Cybersecurity and
Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) to "share security tools and
protocols" with local governments.

"State and local governments with limited resources and cybersecurity
expertise can struggle to secure their systems against malicious hackers
that could expose their constituents' personal data," bill co-sponsor
Senator Gary Peters (D-MI) said after the first Senate passage of the
bill in 2019. ["I'm pleased the Senate passed my **bipartisan** **bill**
that will help ensure all levels of government can bolster their
defenses and protect themselves from sophisticated cyber-attacks,"
Peters continued.]{.underline}

WASHINGTON, DC [-- U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV), a member of the
Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, recently
introduced her bipartisan Strengthening Cybersecurity for Medical
Devices Act]{.underline} with Senator Todd Young (R-IN), which would
[require the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to review and
update medical device cybersecurity guidelines and suggestions to ensure
devices are protected from]{.underline} possible hacking and [**cyber**
**attacks**]{.underline}.

["In light of increased cyber threats, we must **strengthen** the
**security** of our health care system's cyber
infrastructure,"]{.underline} said Senator Rosen. "This [**bipartisan**
**bill**]{.underline} I introduced with Senator Young [will ensure that
medical devices and technologies are up to date with the latest
**cybersecurity**, protecting patients and health care
systems."]{.underline}

"Medical devices are increasingly connected to the Internet or other
health care facility networks to provide features that improve the
ability of health care providers to treat patients," said Senator Young.
"Our bill helps ensure medical devices are protected from cyberattacks
and used safely and securely in order to reduce risks and
vulnerabilities for patients."

The [**bipartisan** **Strengthening** **Cybersecurity** for Medical
Devices **Act** would require the FDA, in consultation with the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), to review
guidance for industry and FDA staff regarding medical device
cybersecurity and make updates as appropriate at least every two
years]{.underline}. This provision would ensure a more timely review to
keep the guidance current. The bill also requires FDA to share
information publicly regarding federal resources for health care
professionals, medical device manufacturers, and health systems to
identify and address cyber vulnerabilities, and access support.
Additionally, the [bill requires a GAO report examining medical device
cybersecurity vulnerabilities and recommendations for improving federal
coordination to support cybersecurity for medical devices.]{.underline}

Senator Rosen has been a leader in strengthening America's cybersecurity
infrastructure. In March, she and Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) introduced
their bipartisan Healthcare Cybersecurity Act, which would direct CISA
to collaborate with the Department of Health and Human Services on
improving cybersecurity in the Health Care and Public Health Sector, one
of the United States' sixteen critical infrastructure sectors. [Senator
Rosen has also introduced a **bipartisan** **bill** to bolster the
**cybersecurity** of the Department of **Veterans** **Affairs** and

Whether it's government networks storing sensitive information or

[With the 2022 legislative calendar now in full swing, we see
cybersecurity policy activity coalescing around several worthwhile
pillars of activity.]{.underline}

Investing in Proactive Cyber Resilience

[The American people understand the value of filling potholes on the
streets and have recognized that our "**digital** **potholes**"
**demand** equal **attention**.]{.underline} While there's no silver
bullet, we can't ignore the economics. [Better cybersecurity outcomes
demand more dedicated cybersecurity investment.]{.underline}

History has taught us that [investing in cyber resilience before
something bad happens will almost always be **cheaper** **in** the
**long** **run**.]{.underline} That's why Palo Alto Networks was
encouraged to see a [State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program
included as a key provision in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act.]{.underline}

The funds provided from this grant program will be cybersecurity game
changers for jurisdictions all across the country. Similarly, the
[cybersecurity plans required to unlock those funds will promote a broad
culture of cybersecurity vigilance that **benefits** **us** **all**. The
multi-entity grant eligibility will promote innovative investments, such
as **security** **operations**]{.underline} centers that span state
lines.

Properly resourcing the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA) will act as a force multiplier to ensure that investment in
cybersecurity resilience is met with technical assistance and services
to help organizations with capacity building. [Both the **House**
**and** **Senate** continue **showing** **eagerness** to fund CISA's

[Investing in cybersecurity resilience will be foundational in gaining
