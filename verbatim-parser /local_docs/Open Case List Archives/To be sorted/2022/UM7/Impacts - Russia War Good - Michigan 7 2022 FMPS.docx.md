[Any nuclear weapon detonated in outer space,]{.underline} 30 kilometers
or higher, [will generate a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse
(HEMP]{.underline}). [**No blast, thermal, fallout or effects other than
HEMP are experienced** in the atmosphere and on the ground]{.underline}.
A nuclear detonation at 30 kilometers altitude will generate a HEMP
field with a radius on the ground of 600 kilometers, damaging all kinds
of electronics, blacking-out electric grids and collapsing other
life-sustaining critical infrastructures. Detonated at 400 kilometers
altitude, the radius of the HEMP field will be about 2,200 kilometers,
large enough to cover most of North America.

[Russia has]{.underline} what they term "[Super-EMP"
weapons]{.underline}, nuclear [warheads specialized for HEMP
attack]{.underline}. [Super-EMP warheads have very low explosive
yield]{.underline} (10 kilotons or less) **[but very high gamma
yield]{.underline}**, which is what generates HEMP. According to Russian
military and technical sources, [Super-EMP weapons can generate HEMP
fields of 100,000 volts/meter or higher, **greatly exceeding the U.S.
military hardening standard** for HEMP (50,000
volts/meter).]{.underline}

[**Russian military doctrine**, because HEMP attacks electronics,
**categorizes nuclear HEMP attack as a dimension of Information Warfare,
Electronic Warfare and Cyber Warfare**, which are modes of warfare
operating within the electromagnetic spectrum.]{.underline}

Commonplace cyber-theft, e-mail disruptions, and hacking, widely
regarded as annoyances by most Americans, could foreshadow catastrophic
nuclear HEMP attacks on the grid that would threaten the existence of
society. In Nazi Germany\'s blitzkrieg strategy, probing by their
motorcycle corps and scout planes, looking for weakness, preceded the
massed onslaught of heavy armored divisions. The same principle may be
at work in cyber-space with probing attacks from Russia, China, North
Korea and Iran. From the perspective of adversary military doctrine on
Electronic Warfare and Cyber Warfare, cyber-thefts and intrusions look
less like isolated cases of theft and hacking and more like probing U.S.
defenses and gauging Washington's reactions---perhaps in preparation for
an all-out cyber offensive that would include physical sabotage, radio
frequency weapons, and ultimately nuclear HEMP attack. Russian HEMP
Tests The Soviet Union discovered the high-altitude electromagnetic
pulse (HEMP) phenomenon probably years before the United States.
High-altitude nuclear testing at its Novaya Zemlya site would have
exposed the Russian cities of Archangel and Murmansk and electric grids
on the Kola Peninsula to HEMP effects. Moreover, Russia being located at
a higher northern latitude than most of the U.S., on the same latitude
as Canada and Alaska, meant greater exposure to geomagnetic storms and
their EMP/GMD effects on communications and power grids, an awareness
reflected in their military writings. On October 22, 1962, the Soviet
Union conducted a high-altitude EMP test---Nuclear Test 184--- over part
of its own territory, deliberately exposing Kazakhstan\'s electric grid
to HEMP as an experiment. \"These EMP producing tests were done over a
large populated land mass in Kazakhstan,\" writes Jerry Emanuelson in
his study of Test 184, \"Even though the economic state of Kazakhstan in
1962 was quite primitive by today\'s standards, it was heavily
industrialized and electrified.\" The HEMP field generated by Nuclear
Test 184 covered all of Kazakhstan. Emanuelson: "Test 184 was detonated
at 290 kilometers above a point that was 180 miles due west of
Zhezgazghan\....At an altitude of 290 kilometers above the detonation
point in central Kazakhstan, the distance to the horizon would have been
more than 1900 kilometers, which would have caused an electromagnetic
pulse over all of Kazakhstan." Data from Nuclear Test 184, the results
of which were kept secret for over thirty years, were partially shared
with the West in a briefing by Russian General Vladimir M. Loberev in
1994. Nuclear Test 184 confirmed definitively for the Soviets in 1962
what the United States concluded independently by extrapolation from the
U.S. STARFISH PRIME and other nuclear test results (conducted over the
Pacific Ocean), and from experiments conducted over 50 years using EMP
simulators and by computer modeling. Nuclear Test 184 destroyed
transformers, generators, communications, switches and all manner of
electronics within an enormous footprint extending hundreds of
kilometers---thereby proving the advantages and dangers of HEMP attack
empirically. Monstrous and unethical as may have been the USSR\'s
decision to conduct an HEMP test against their own people, Nuclear Test
184 and other tests armed the Soviet Union with the best HEMP data in
the world in 1962. Nuclear Test 184 was part of a series of seven Soviet
nuclear HEMP tests conducted over the USSR\'s own territory, mostly over
Kazakhstan, commencing on September 6, 1961, and ending on November 1,
1962. Whereas the U.S. was surprised by its discovery of HEMP during its
1962 nuclear test STARFISH PRIME, the Soviets were already aware of HEMP
during their nuclear test series and were very well prepared with a
large array of scientific instruments all over Kazakhstan to test and
investigate HEMP effects from actual high-altitude nuclear detonations
in a way that has never been approximated by the United States or any
other nation. The first two Soviet HEMP nuclear tests, on September 6,
1961, and October 6, 1961, were codenamed \"Thunderstorm\" and
\"Thunder\" perhaps reflecting the HEMP mission. All of the tests were
very realistic, using military ballistic missiles, mostly the SS-4
medium-range missile, to deliver and detonate the warheads at
high-altitude. The HEMP tests used a wide variety of warheads, with
yields ranging from merely 1.2 kilotons to 300 kilotons, detonated at
greatly varying altitudes, ranging from 22.7 kilometers to 300
kilometers height-of-burst. There is no question that as a result of its
HEMP nuclear test series, the Soviet Union, and today Russia, probably
knows a lot more about HEMP effects than the United States. \"In 1962,
the then Soviet Union conducted several high-altitude nuclear tests in
Kazakhstan in the course of which were obtained vast facts on the damage
levels from HEMP illuminating both military and civil systems,\" writes
Russian scientist Vasiliy Greetsai today. \"Most of those \'vast facts\'
are apparently still kept secretly at the Russian Federation Ministry of
Defense at the Central Institute of Physics in Sergiev Posad, Russia,\"
warns Emanuelson in his study of Test 184, \"Only a tiny amount of those
facts have been publicly released, but those facts have been extremely
informative.\" Russia Shares Some HEMP Data Why did Russia share any
HEMP nuclear test data with the West, and why just Nuclear Test 184 in
particular? It is generally assumed that Russian General Loberev\'s 1994
briefing on Nuclear Test 184 to an international audience was a benign
act, part of the post-Cold War thaw in relations under the pro-Western
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. However, a less benign interpretation
of the facts is possible. Perhaps the Russian General Staff approved
Loberev\'s 1994 briefing to the West on Nuclear Test 184 because they
hope to mislead the United States on the real severity of the threat and
preserve U.S. vulnerability to HEMP attack. Emanuelson in his study of
Test 184 observes that the nuclear weapon used for this test---as
impressive as were the results---was an inefficient design for HEMP, and
probably produced weaker HEMP fields than the U.S. STARFISH PRIME
nuclear test. Nor have the Russians disclosed, even for Test 184, the
strength of the peak HEMP fields that can do the most damage.20 Yet
among Western specialists Test 184 has become a sort of \"gold
standard\" that rivals in importance STARFISH PRIME as a basis for
designing HEMP protection Moscow jealously guards the secrets of its
other HEMP nuclear tests---that includes more than the seven
high-altitude detonations for the 1961-62 test series. Most Western
analysts assume that Russia is sharing its best data by disclosing Test
184. Even the usually meticulous Emanuelson appears to jump to this
conclusion: \"The first two of the K Project high altitude nuclear tests
(in 1961) over Kazakhstan were only 1.2 kilotons so the
EMP\...apparently did not have much of an impact on the 1961
infrastructure of Kazakhstan." But we do not know the impact of these
HEMP tests, because Moscow is not telling. Perhaps significantly, at
least one of these Soviet HEMP tests was conducted in an Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) mode, involving a high-altitude interception of a target.
Moreover, all of the tests were conducted over the Saryshagan ABM test
range.22 One design of a Soviet ABM warhead is like an Enhanced
Radiation Warhead, a warhead having low explosive yield but capable of
producing lots of neutrons, x-rays, gamma rays and other radiation to
kill incoming warheads. Such a weapon, low-yield but emitting enhanced
gamma rays that make high-frequency HEMP, could produce an
extraordinarily powerful HEMP field, tantamount to a Super-EMP warhead.
Is it possible that Moscow discovered, by accident or design, the secret
for making a Super-EMP nuclear weapon in 1961? Did Moscow share data
from Nuclear Test 184 in 1994 because they want to disinform the United
States and its allies about the real maximum HEMP threat, so that the
West will under-prepare, and remain vulnerable to Super-EMP?

[Russian HEMP Threats Russia\'s Super-EMP weapons]{.underline}---[that
**have no counterpart in the U.S. nuclear arsenal**]{.underline}---and
Russia\'s superior defensive preparations against HEMP, may have
emboldened the Russian Duma in 1999 to threaten an HEMP attack against
the United States for NATO\'s bombing of Russian ally Serbia. As
witnessed by the U.S. congressional delegation to Vienna, meeting with
their counterparts from the Russian Duma, Vladimir Lukin, Chairman of
the Duma International Affairs Committee, and Deputy Chairman Alexander
Shabonov, threatened:

LUKIN---\"Hypothetically, if Russia really wanted to hurt the United
States in retaliation for NATO\'s bombing of Yugoslavia, Russia could
fire a submarine launched ballistic missile and detonate a single
nuclear warhead at high-altitude over the United States. The resulting
electromagnetic pulse would massively disrupt U.S. communications and
computer systems, shutting down everything. No internet. Nothing.\"
SHABANOV---"And if that didn't work, we'd just launch another missile."
Moscow's threatened nuclear HEMP attack on the U.S. to the face of an
official congressional delegation was a contributing factor to the
establishment of the EMP Commission. Indeed, Moscow frequently
flourishes its nuclear saber to threaten the United States, as if
emboldened by knowledge of some decisive nuclear advantage, like
Super-EMP weapons and HEMP attack. For example, Russian General Staff
Chief Nikolai Makarov threatened a preemptive strike against NATO
anti-missile sites in Poland and the Czech Republic in 2012.24
Increasingly aggressive nuclear threats have been made by Russia in
2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and especially after Vladimir Putin's March
1, 2018 announcement of new nuclear super-weapons, that Putin threatened
will compel the U.S. to, "Listen to us now!"25 According to former
senior Defense Department official, Dr. Mark Schneider: "Between October
24, 2018 and March 2019, the nuclear missile targeting threat was made
at least 11 times at the highest levels---by President Putin, by the
Chief of the General Staff of the Army Valery Gerasimov, by the
Strategic Missile Force Commander Colonel General Sergei Ryabkov."26 Yet
despite all Russia\'s nuclear preparations and threats, Moscow still
fears a HEMP attack. A Norwegian scientific rocket, launched on January
25, 1995, to explore the aurora borealis, was mistaken by the Russian
military as a surprise HEMP attack launched by a U.S. submarine---nearly
resulting in a massive Russian preemptive strike. This still little
known incident, happening a half decade after the end of the Cold War,
is the closest the sides have ever come to nuclear conflict, triggered
by the specter of surprise HEMP attack.

[Russian Military Doctrine]{.underline}: [HEMP Attack Decisive Russian
General Vladimir Slipchenko in his military textbook Non-Contact Wars
describes the]{.underline} combined [use of]{.underline} cyber viruses
and hacking, physical attacks, non-nuclear EMP weapons, and ultimately
nuclear [HEMP attack against electric grids and critical infrastructures
as a new way of warfare that is the greatest Revolution in Military
Affairs (RMA) in history]{.underline}. [Slipchenko sees EMP as such a
departure from traditional ways and means of warfare]{.underline} that
he describes EMP weapons and warfare as "based on new physical
principles"---a phrase that has become ubiquitous in Russian literature
to describe the military revolution that is EMP:

"In practically all preceding generations of wars...weapons were
employed that acted against targets primarily by kinetic, chemical and
thermal energy. In addition to these arms...new ones will also
appear...in wars of the future...Weapons based on new physical
principles having an electromagnetic effect will see considerable
development. They will represent a form of casualty and damage producing
effect on targets through the energy of electromagnetic emissions of
various wavelengths and levels of power generated by radio frequency and
laser weapons and by means of electronic countermeasures using a
conventional or high-altitude nuclear burst...Depending on the power of
emission, such weapons will be capable of...suppressing practically all
classic electronic equipment...causing the melting or evaporation of
metal in the printed circuit boards...or causing structural changes of
electronic elements..."

Like Nazi Germany's "Blitzkrieg" ("Lightning War") strategy that
coordinated airpower, armor, and mobile infantry to achieve strategic
and technological surprise that nearly defeated the Allies in World War
II[, the "New Blitzkrieg" is, literally and figuratively, an electronic
"Lightning War"]{.underline} so potentially decisive in its effects that
an entire civilization could be overthrown in hours. [According to
General Slipchenko]{.underline}, [EMP and the new military revolution
renders obsolete modern armies, navies and air forces]{.underline}. For
the first time in history, small nations or even non-state actors can
humble the most advanced nations on Earth.

An article in Military Thought, the flagship journal of the Russian
General Staff, "Weak Points of the U.S. Concept of Network-Centric
Warfare" points to nuclear HEMP attack as a means of defeating the
United States: "American forces may be vulnerable to electronic warfare
attacks, in particular, an electromagnetic pulse that is a brief
powerful electromagnetic field capable of overloading or destroying
numerous electronic systems and high-tech microcircuits that are very
sensitive to the electromagnetic field, even if transmitted from a
distance. A single low-yield nuclear weapon exploded for this purpose
high above the area of combat operations can generate an electromagnetic
pulse covering a large area and destroying electronic equipment without
loss of life that is caused by the blast or radiation." Moreover:
"Today, too, a considerable body of administrative information in the
U.S. armed forces goes through the civilian Internet. Many civilian
commercial communication satellites, particularly satellites in low
orbits, can have their functions impaired or they can be disabled by
electromagnetic shocks from high altitudes."

According to another [Russian article: "Nuclear war strategy has already
planned nuclear explosions at an altitude of 50-100 km to destroy enemy
satellites' electronic instruments with electromagnetic
pulse":]{.underline}

"There are now about 683 space craft in near-earth orbit. Of these about
150 are Russian and about 400 American. In the estimation of
specialists, for every 100 of our 'purely' military espionage artificial
earth satellites there are 300 civilian satellites. Clearly, this
discrepancy will increase both quantitatively and qualitatively
(considering the state of the Russian military industrial
complex)...Nuclear war strategy has already planned nuclear explosions
at an altitude of 50-100 km to destroy enemy satellites' electronic
instruments with an electromagnetic pulse."

A 2015 article from [Russia's A.A. Maksimov Scientific Research
Institute for Space Systems, alludes to low-yield nuclear enhanced-EMP
as **the most effective cyber weapon**]{.underline}: "Even more
effective are remote-controlled cyber weapons in the nuclear variant,
but in this case a warhead is required with a capacity many times
smaller by comparison with the charges of the typical strategic
missiles."

["**Super-EMP is a...first-strike weapon**," according to Aleksey
Vaschenko,]{.underline} who describes Russian nuclear weapons specially
designed to make extraordinarily powerful EMP fields as Russia's means
for defeating the United States in "A Nuclear Response To America Is
Possible":

"The further direction of the work on the development of Super-EMP was
associated with the increase of its kill effect by focusing Y-radiation,
which should have resulted in an increase of the pulse's amplitude.
These properties of [Super-EMP make it a first strike weapon, which is
designed to disable the state and military command and control
system,]{.underline} the economy, ICBMs, especially mobile based ICBMs,
missiles on the flight trajectory, radar sites, spacecraft, energy
supply systems, and so forth. So, [Super-EMP is obviously offensive in
nature and is a destabilizing firststrike weapon]{.underline}...[The
Russian nuclear component **relies on the Super-EMP factor**, which is
the Russian response to U.S. nuclear blackmail]{.underline}."

Hypersonic Warheads: New HEMP Threat Russian development of hypersonic
missile warheads is a dangerous new dimension of the nuclear and HEMP
threat. Great speed (Mach 20, twenty times the speed of sound) and
flying a flat trajectory, skimming along the top of the upper
atmosphere, significantly reduces visibility to U.S. early-warning
satellites and radars, while also reducing arrival time. Maneuvering
makes hypersonic warheads more difficult to track and intercept,
virtually impossible to intercept with existing U.S. National Missile
Defenses. Former senior Defense Department official Dr. Mark Schneider
writes, "The main reason for Russian hypersonic missiles is a nuclear
surprise attack and America has no defense against it."3 Four-star
General John Hyten, then chief of the U.S. Strategic Command that
controls the nuclear Triad (now Vice Chairman Joint Chief of Staff),
agrees with Schneider: "Hypersonic capabilities are a significant
challenge. We are going to need a different set of sensors to see
hypersonic threats. Our enemies know that."

[Russia deployed]{.underline} its first regiment of SS-19 ICBMs armed
with [hypersonic Avangard nuclear warheads at the end of December
2019.]{.underline}

[Hypersonic vehicles fly over most of their trajectory at 50-100
kilometers altitude: the optimum height-of-burst for Super-EMP
warheads]{.underline}

Hypersonic weapons are potentially a new avenue for surprise nuclear
HEMP attack that could defeat deterrence. We cannot see the attack
coming and may not know against whom to retaliate, especially if HEMP
attack blinds satellites and radars needed for early-warning and threat
assessment.

**[Hypersonically delivered HEMP attack could win World War III with a
single electronic blow.]{.underline}**

HEMP Satellites? During the Cold War, the USSR developed a secret weapon
called the Fractional Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS). The FOBS would
disguise a nuclear attack as a peaceful satellite launch, orbiting a
nuclear-armed satellite over the South Pole to attack the U.S. from the
south--- from which direction the U.S. is blind and defenseless as there
are no BMEWS radars or antimissile defenses facing south. The FOBS
satellite could deliver a HEMP attack paralyzing U.S. retaliatory forces
and C3I in the first shot of a nuclear war. Miroslav Gyurosi in The
Soviet Fractional Orbital Bombardment System describes Moscow\'s
development of the FOBS as part of \"a long running campaign of
strategic deception against the West through the whole Cold War period,
and the protracted development of the Soviet FOBS nuclear weapon system
presents an excellent case study of such.\" Gyurosi: "The Fractional
Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS) as it was known in the West, was a
Soviet innovation intended to exploit the limitations of U.S. BMEW radar
coverage. The idea behind FOBS was that a large thermonuclear warhead
would be inserted into a steeply inclined low altitude polar orbit, such
that it would approach the CONUS from any direction, but primarily from
the southern hemisphere, and following a programmed braking maneuver,
re-enter from a direction which was not covered by U.S. BMEW radars."

\"**[The first warning the U.S. would have of such a strike in progress
would be the EMP]{.underline}**\...,\" writes Gyurosi.

Russia has the technical capability to clandestinely orbit a
nuclear-armed satellite or satellites to be maintained in orbit for
years until needed to make a surprise HEMP attack against the U.S., NATO
Europe, or some other target. If Russia is orbiting nuclear-armed
satellites for HEMP surprise attack, this would be one of their deepest
and best protected military secrets. In addition to obvious strategic
considerations, the Outer Space Treaty bans orbiting nuclear weapons in
space. Moreover, Russia has pursued a long propaganda offensive
criticizing the U.S. for "militarizing space" intended to deter the U.S.
from orbiting space-based missile defenses and from improving U.S.
military capabilities in space. HEMP attacks by satellite or missiles or
in combination could be the key to Russian victory in a nuclear war, as
U.S. strategic bombers, missiles, and C3I are not hardened to survive
attack by Super-EMP weapons, as noted in testimony before the House
Armed Services Committee by Dr. William Graham, Chairman of the EMP
Commission: MR. BARTLETT: "It is my understanding that, in interviewing
some Russian generals, that they told you that the Soviets had developed
a 'Super-EMP' enhanced weapon that could produce 200 kilovolts per meter
at the center?\...This is about, what, four times higher than anything
we ever built or tested to, in terms of EMP hardening?" DR. GRAHAM:
"Yes." MR. BARTLETT: "Which means that, even if you were some hundreds
of miles away from that, that it would be somewhere in the range of 50
to 100 kilovolts per meter at the margins of our country, for instance?"
DR. GRAHAM: "Yes. Over much of the margin." MR. BARTLETT: "So, we aren't
sure that much of our military would still be operable after that robust
laydown. Is that correct?\...I also understand that we aren't certain
that we could launch, through a series of robust EMP laydowns, that we
could launch our intercontinental ballistic missiles?" DR. GRAHAM: "We
designed both the missiles and their bases and the strategic
communications systems during the Cold War to be able to survive and
operate through EMP fields on the order of 50 kilovolts per meter, which
was our concern at the time, before we realized that weapons could be
designed that had larger EMP fields." Russian President Vladimir Putin,
in a world televised speech on March 1, 2018, announced a new
heavy-ICBM, the most powerful ever made, called "Sarmat" ("Satan II" by
NATO) that is "invincible" because it can strike anywhere on Earth, and
even attack the U.S. by flying over the South Pole, like the FOBs. Putin
declared: "Not even future missile defense systems will offer any
trouble to the Russian rocket complex, Sarmat," HEMP Threat To U.S.
Submarines? HEMP attack could achieve for Russia a key objective the
USSR could not achieve during the Cold War---neutralizing U.S. ballistic
missile submarines at sea. Russian Super-EMP weapons could destroy or
degrade U.S. bombers, ICBMs, SSBNs in port and their strategic
C3I---including land-based VLF communications systems, TACAMO aircraft,
and other redundant means of strategic command and control used to
convey Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) to submarines hiding at sea.
Severing their communications links to the National Command Authority
would neutralize U.S. submarines, rendering them useless. HEMP could
also be used to attack submarines on patrol at sea directly. A
high-yield warhead (1 megaton or more) detonated for HEMP over the ocean
would cover an area 2,200 kilometers in radius, a zone nearly as large
as North America, with powerful E3 HEMP that would penetrate the ocean
depths and possibly damage or destroy the electronics of submarines on
patrol. Submarines would be especially vulnerable when deploying their
very long antennae---which they need to do precisely when trying to
receive EAMS.43 VOSTOK-18 On September 11-17, 2018, Russia's VOSTOK-18
was perhaps the largest military exercise in history, happening two
months after U.S. Department of Homeland Security revelations that
Russia penetrated hundreds of U.S. electric utilities with
cyber-weapons. A few significant highlights: VOSTOK-18 mobilized 300,000
troops, 36,000 tanks and other vehicles, 1,000 aircraft, and 80 ships.
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu described it as the largest
exercise since ZAPAD81, the largest Cold War exercise that, 40 years
ago, simulated invading NATO. VOSTOK-18 apparently utilized other forces
not advertised, including Russia's Mediterranean fleet fighting a real
war in Syria and the Strategic Rocket Forces Missile Armies, simulating
a global nuclear World War III. VOSTOK-18 was a joint Russia-China
exercise, signifying de facto alliance against the United States. Russia
and China conduct many joint military exercises. Their nuclear
collaboration began February 2001 in a combined nuclear war scenario
against the U.S. over Taiwan.46 The SinoRussian Friendship Treaty (July
2001) promises their military cooperation "will further strategic
stability and security around the world." VOSTOK-18, though conducted in
Siberia, may well be full-dress rehearsal for conquering NATO,
practicing new nuclear warfighting techniques. Siberian operations are
harder for the U.S. to monitor, so new strategies and tactics can be
exercised secretly.

[Russia's **new** nuclear doctrine]{.underline} (similar to
Khrushchev-era thinking, like a more aggressive version of Marshal
Sokolovsky's 1962 Military Strategy) [relies on]{.underline} [nuclear
firepower and relatively small armies]{.underline}, but highly mobile
and survivable, to knife through Europe in a week or two.49 [Russia's
new generation nuclear weapons for strategic HEMP attack and tactical
battlefield use make this possible.]{.underline}

Theoretically, Russian invasion of NATO by 300,000 troops, 36,000 tanks
and other vehicles, and 1,000 aircraft could overrun NATO paralyzed by
EMP attack and outgunned by tactical nuclear weapons 10-to-1. A single
nuclear weapon detonated 60 kilometers above NATO HQ in Brussels would
generate a paralyzing HEMP field from Poland to Scotland, like a magic
carpet to the English Channel.5 VOSTOK-18 practiced civil defense and
recovery operations unrivaled in the West. "Eastern Military District
engineer formation mopped-up in aftermath of a simulated technogenic
emergency during VOSTOK-18 maneuvers," according to the Russian Defense
Ministry, "The military engineers launched bridges and ferry crossings,
restored demolished roads, prepared passage through rubble...evacuated
the population, and cleared terrain of simulated explosive objects and
radioactive and chemical waste." These same operations could support an
invasion of NATO. But the most important part of VOSTOK-18 was invisible

[Russian]{.underline} and Chinese [military doctrine also advocates a
revolutionary new way of warfare rendering obsolete traditional military
power by relying on cyber-attacks, sabotage, and EMP]{.underline} to
collapse adversary electric grids and life-sustaining critical
infrastructures, thereby achieving victory.

altitude, the radius of the HEMP field will be about 2,200 kilometers,
large enough to cover most of North America.

[Russia has]{.underline} what they term "[Super-EMP"
weapons]{.underline}, nuclear [warheads specialized for HEMP
attack]{.underline}. [Super-EMP warheads have very low explosive
yield]{.underline} (10 kilotons or less) **[but very high gamma
yield]{.underline}**, which is what generates HEMP. According to Russian
military and technical sources, [Super-EMP weapons can generate HEMP
fields of 100,000 volts/meter or higher, **greatly exceeding the U.S.
military hardening standard** for HEMP (50,000
volts/meter).]{.underline}

[**Russian military doctrine**, because HEMP attacks electronics,
**categorizes nuclear HEMP attack as a dimension of Information Warfare,
Electronic Warfare and Cyber Warfare**, which are modes of warfare
operating within the electromagnetic spectrum.]{.underline}

Commonplace cyber-theft, e-mail disruptions, and hacking, widely
regarded as annoyances by most Americans, could foreshadow catastrophic
nuclear HEMP attacks on the grid that would threaten the existence of
society. In Nazi Germany\'s blitzkrieg strategy, probing by their
motorcycle corps and scout planes, looking for weakness, preceded the
massed onslaught of heavy armored divisions. The same principle may be
at work in cyber-space with probing attacks from Russia, China, North
Korea and Iran. From the perspective of adversary military doctrine on
Electronic Warfare and Cyber Warfare, cyber-thefts and intrusions look
less like isolated cases of theft and hacking and more like probing U.S.
defenses and gauging Washington's reactions---perhaps in preparation for
an all-out cyber offensive that would include physical sabotage, radio
frequency weapons, and ultimately nuclear HEMP attack. Russian HEMP
Tests The Soviet Union discovered the high-altitude electromagnetic
pulse (HEMP) phenomenon probably years before the United States.
High-altitude nuclear testing at its Novaya Zemlya site would have
exposed the Russian cities of Archangel and Murmansk and electric grids
on the Kola Peninsula to HEMP effects. Moreover, Russia being located at
a higher northern latitude than most of the U.S., on the same latitude
as Canada and Alaska, meant greater exposure to geomagnetic storms and
their EMP/GMD effects on communications and power grids, an awareness
reflected in their military writings. On October 22, 1962, the Soviet
Union conducted a high-altitude EMP test---Nuclear Test 184--- over part
of its own territory, deliberately exposing Kazakhstan\'s electric grid
to HEMP as an experiment. \"These EMP producing tests were done over a
large populated land mass in Kazakhstan,\" writes Jerry Emanuelson in
his study of Test 184, \"Even though the economic state of Kazakhstan in
1962 was quite primitive by today\'s standards, it was heavily
industrialized and electrified.\" The HEMP field generated by Nuclear
Test 184 covered all of Kazakhstan. Emanuelson: "Test 184 was detonated
at 290 kilometers above a point that was 180 miles due west of
Zhezgazghan\....At an altitude of 290 kilometers above the detonation
point in central Kazakhstan, the distance to the horizon would have been
more than 1900 kilometers, which would have caused an electromagnetic
pulse over all of Kazakhstan." Data from Nuclear Test 184, the results
of which were kept secret for over thirty years, were partially shared
with the West in a briefing by Russian General Vladimir M. Loberev in
1994. Nuclear Test 184 confirmed definitively for the Soviets in 1962
what the United States concluded independently by extrapolation from the
U.S. STARFISH PRIME and other nuclear test results (conducted over the
Pacific Ocean), and from experiments conducted over 50 years using EMP
simulators and by computer modeling. Nuclear Test 184 destroyed
transformers, generators, communications, switches and all manner of
electronics within an enormous footprint extending hundreds of
kilometers---thereby proving the advantages and dangers of HEMP attack
empirically. Monstrous and unethical as may have been the USSR\'s
decision to conduct an HEMP test against their own people, Nuclear Test
184 and other tests armed the Soviet Union with the best HEMP data in
the world in 1962. Nuclear Test 184 was part of a series of seven Soviet
nuclear HEMP tests conducted over the USSR\'s own territory, mostly over
Kazakhstan, commencing on September 6, 1961, and ending on November 1,
1962. Whereas the U.S. was surprised by its discovery of HEMP during its
1962 nuclear test STARFISH PRIME, the Soviets were already aware of HEMP
during their nuclear test series and were very well prepared with a
large array of scientific instruments all over Kazakhstan to test and
investigate HEMP effects from actual high-altitude nuclear detonations
in a way that has never been approximated by the United States or any
other nation. The first two Soviet HEMP nuclear tests, on September 6,
1961, and October 6, 1961, were codenamed \"Thunderstorm\" and
\"Thunder\" perhaps reflecting the HEMP mission. All of the tests were
very realistic, using military ballistic missiles, mostly the SS-4
medium-range missile, to deliver and detonate the warheads at
high-altitude. The HEMP tests used a wide variety of warheads, with
yields ranging from merely 1.2 kilotons to 300 kilotons, detonated at
greatly varying altitudes, ranging from 22.7 kilometers to 300
kilometers height-of-burst. There is no question that as a result of its
HEMP nuclear test series, the Soviet Union, and today Russia, probably
knows a lot more about HEMP effects than the United States. \"In 1962,
the then Soviet Union conducted several high-altitude nuclear tests in
Kazakhstan in the course of which were obtained vast facts on the damage
levels from HEMP illuminating both military and civil systems,\" writes
Russian scientist Vasiliy Greetsai today. \"Most of those \'vast facts\'
are apparently still kept secretly at the Russian Federation Ministry of
Defense at the Central Institute of Physics in Sergiev Posad, Russia,\"
warns Emanuelson in his study of Test 184, \"Only a tiny amount of those
facts have been publicly released, but those facts have been extremely
informative.\" Russia Shares Some HEMP Data Why did Russia share any
HEMP nuclear test data with the West, and why just Nuclear Test 184 in
particular? It is generally assumed that Russian General Loberev\'s 1994
briefing on Nuclear Test 184 to an international audience was a benign
act, part of the post-Cold War thaw in relations under the pro-Western
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. However, a less benign interpretation
of the facts is possible. Perhaps the Russian General Staff approved
Loberev\'s 1994 briefing to the West on Nuclear Test 184 because they
hope to mislead the United States on the real severity of the threat and
preserve U.S. vulnerability to HEMP attack. Emanuelson in his study of
Test 184 observes that the nuclear weapon used for this test---as
impressive as were the results---was an inefficient design for HEMP, and
probably produced weaker HEMP fields than the U.S. STARFISH PRIME
nuclear test. Nor have the Russians disclosed, even for Test 184, the
strength of the peak HEMP fields that can do the most damage.20 Yet
among Western specialists Test 184 has become a sort of \"gold
standard\" that rivals in importance STARFISH PRIME as a basis for
designing HEMP protection Moscow jealously guards the secrets of its
other HEMP nuclear tests---that includes more than the seven
high-altitude detonations for the 1961-62 test series. Most Western
analysts assume that Russia is sharing its best data by disclosing Test
184. Even the usually meticulous Emanuelson appears to jump to this
conclusion: \"The first two of the K Project high altitude nuclear tests
(in 1961) over Kazakhstan were only 1.2 kilotons so the
EMP\...apparently did not have much of an impact on the 1961
infrastructure of Kazakhstan." But we do not know the impact of these
HEMP tests, because Moscow is not telling. Perhaps significantly, at
least one of these Soviet HEMP tests was conducted in an Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) mode, involving a high-altitude interception of a target.
Moreover, all of the tests were conducted over the Saryshagan ABM test
range.22 One design of a Soviet ABM warhead is like an Enhanced
Radiation Warhead, a warhead having low explosive yield but capable of
producing lots of neutrons, x-rays, gamma rays and other radiation to
kill incoming warheads. Such a weapon, low-yield but emitting enhanced
gamma rays that make high-frequency HEMP, could produce an
extraordinarily powerful HEMP field, tantamount to a Super-EMP warhead.
Is it possible that Moscow discovered, by accident or design, the secret
for making a Super-EMP nuclear weapon in 1961? Did Moscow share data
from Nuclear Test 184 in 1994 because they want to disinform the United
States and its allies about the real maximum HEMP threat, so that the
West will under-prepare, and remain vulnerable to Super-EMP?

[Russian HEMP Threats Russia\'s Super-EMP weapons]{.underline}---[that
**have no counterpart in the U.S. nuclear arsenal**]{.underline}---and
Russia\'s superior defensive preparations against HEMP, may have
emboldened the Russian Duma in 1999 to threaten an HEMP attack against
the United States for NATO\'s bombing of Russian ally Serbia. As
witnessed by the U.S. congressional delegation to Vienna, meeting with
their counterparts from the Russian Duma, Vladimir Lukin, Chairman of
the Duma International Affairs Committee, and Deputy Chairman Alexander
Shabonov, threatened:

LUKIN---\"Hypothetically, if Russia really wanted to hurt the United
States in retaliation for NATO\'s bombing of Yugoslavia, Russia could
fire a submarine launched ballistic missile and detonate a single
nuclear warhead at high-altitude over the United States. The resulting
electromagnetic pulse would massively disrupt U.S. communications and
computer systems, shutting down everything. No internet. Nothing.\"
SHABANOV---"And if that didn't work, we'd just launch another missile."
Moscow's threatened nuclear HEMP attack on the U.S. to the face of an
official congressional delegation was a contributing factor to the
establishment of the EMP Commission. Indeed, Moscow frequently
flourishes its nuclear saber to threaten the United States, as if
emboldened by knowledge of some decisive nuclear advantage, like
Super-EMP weapons and HEMP attack. For example, Russian General Staff
Chief Nikolai Makarov threatened a preemptive strike against NATO
anti-missile sites in Poland and the Czech Republic in 2012.24
Increasingly aggressive nuclear threats have been made by Russia in
2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and especially after Vladimir Putin's March
1, 2018 announcement of new nuclear super-weapons, that Putin threatened
will compel the U.S. to, "Listen to us now!"25 According to former
senior Defense Department official, Dr. Mark Schneider: "Between October
24, 2018 and March 2019, the nuclear missile targeting threat was made
at least 11 times at the highest levels---by President Putin, by the
Chief of the General Staff of the Army Valery Gerasimov, by the
Strategic Missile Force Commander Colonel General Sergei Ryabkov."26 Yet
despite all Russia\'s nuclear preparations and threats, Moscow still
fears a HEMP attack. A Norwegian scientific rocket, launched on January
25, 1995, to explore the aurora borealis, was mistaken by the Russian
military as a surprise HEMP attack launched by a U.S. submarine---nearly
resulting in a massive Russian preemptive strike. This still little
known incident, happening a half decade after the end of the Cold War,
is the closest the sides have ever come to nuclear conflict, triggered
by the specter of surprise HEMP attack.

[Russian Military Doctrine]{.underline}: [HEMP Attack Decisive Russian
General Vladimir Slipchenko in his military textbook Non-Contact Wars
describes the]{.underline} combined [use of]{.underline} cyber viruses
and hacking, physical attacks, non-nuclear EMP weapons, and ultimately
nuclear [HEMP attack against electric grids and critical infrastructures
as a new way of warfare that is the greatest Revolution in Military
Affairs (RMA) in history]{.underline}. [Slipchenko sees EMP as such a
departure from traditional ways and means of warfare]{.underline} that
he describes EMP weapons and warfare as "based on new physical
principles"---a phrase that has become ubiquitous in Russian literature
to describe the military revolution that is EMP:

"In practically all preceding generations of wars...weapons were
employed that acted against targets primarily by kinetic, chemical and
thermal energy. In addition to these arms...new ones will also
appear...in wars of the future...Weapons based on new physical
principles having an electromagnetic effect will see considerable
development. They will represent a form of casualty and damage producing
effect on targets through the energy of electromagnetic emissions of
various wavelengths and levels of power generated by radio frequency and
laser weapons and by means of electronic countermeasures using a
conventional or high-altitude nuclear burst...Depending on the power of
emission, such weapons will be capable of...suppressing practically all
classic electronic equipment...causing the melting or evaporation of
metal in the printed circuit boards...or causing structural changes of
electronic elements..."

Like Nazi Germany's "Blitzkrieg" ("Lightning War") strategy that
coordinated airpower, armor, and mobile infantry to achieve strategic
and technological surprise that nearly defeated the Allies in World War
II[, the "New Blitzkrieg" is, literally and figuratively, an electronic
"Lightning War"]{.underline} so potentially decisive in its effects that
an entire civilization could be overthrown in hours. [According to
General Slipchenko]{.underline}, [EMP and the new military revolution
renders obsolete modern armies, navies and air forces]{.underline}. For
the first time in history, small nations or even non-state actors can
humble the most advanced nations on Earth.

An article in Military Thought, the flagship journal of the Russian
General Staff, "Weak Points of the U.S. Concept of Network-Centric
Warfare" points to nuclear HEMP attack as a means of defeating the
United States: "American forces may be vulnerable to electronic warfare
attacks, in particular, an electromagnetic pulse that is a brief
powerful electromagnetic field capable of overloading or destroying
numerous electronic systems and high-tech microcircuits that are very
sensitive to the electromagnetic field, even if transmitted from a
distance. A single low-yield nuclear weapon exploded for this purpose
high above the area of combat operations can generate an electromagnetic
pulse covering a large area and destroying electronic equipment without
loss of life that is caused by the blast or radiation." Moreover:
"Today, too, a considerable body of administrative information in the
U.S. armed forces goes through the civilian Internet. Many civilian
commercial communication satellites, particularly satellites in low
orbits, can have their functions impaired or they can be disabled by
electromagnetic shocks from high altitudes."

According to another [Russian article: "Nuclear war strategy has already
planned nuclear explosions at an altitude of 50-100 km to destroy enemy
satellites' electronic instruments with electromagnetic
pulse":]{.underline}

"There are now about 683 space craft in near-earth orbit. Of these about
150 are Russian and about 400 American. In the estimation of
specialists, for every 100 of our 'purely' military espionage artificial
earth satellites there are 300 civilian satellites. Clearly, this
discrepancy will increase both quantitatively and qualitatively
(considering the state of the Russian military industrial
complex)...Nuclear war strategy has already planned nuclear explosions
at an altitude of 50-100 km to destroy enemy satellites' electronic
instruments with an electromagnetic pulse."

A 2015 article from [Russia's A.A. Maksimov Scientific Research
Institute for Space Systems, alludes to low-yield nuclear enhanced-EMP
as **the most effective cyber weapon**]{.underline}: "Even more
effective are remote-controlled cyber weapons in the nuclear variant,
but in this case a warhead is required with a capacity many times
smaller by comparison with the charges of the typical strategic
missiles."

["**Super-EMP is a...first-strike weapon**," according to Aleksey
Vaschenko,]{.underline} who describes Russian nuclear weapons specially
designed to make extraordinarily powerful EMP fields as Russia's means
for defeating the United States in "A Nuclear Response To America Is
Possible":

"The further direction of the work on the development of Super-EMP was
associated with the increase of its kill effect by focusing Y-radiation,
which should have resulted in an increase of the pulse's amplitude.
These properties of Super-EMP make it a first strike weapon, which is
designed to disable the state and military command and control system,
the economy, ICBMs, especially mobile based ICBMs, missiles on the
flight trajectory, radar sites, spacecraft, energy supply systems, and
so forth. So, Super-EMP is obviously offensive in nature and is a
destabilizing firststrike weapon...[The Russian nuclear component
**relies on the Super-EMP factor**, which is the Russian response to
U.S. nuclear blackmail]{.underline}."

Hypersonic Warheads: New HEMP Threat Russian development of hypersonic
missile warheads is a dangerous new dimension of the nuclear and HEMP
threat. Great speed (Mach 20, twenty times the speed of sound) and
flying a flat trajectory, skimming along the top of the upper
atmosphere, significantly reduces visibility to U.S. early-warning
satellites and radars, while also reducing arrival time. Maneuvering
makes hypersonic warheads more difficult to track and intercept,
virtually impossible to intercept with existing U.S. National Missile
Defenses. Former senior Defense Department official Dr. Mark Schneider
writes, "The main reason for Russian hypersonic missiles is a nuclear
surprise attack and America has no defense against it."3 Four-star
General John Hyten, then chief of the U.S. Strategic Command that
controls the nuclear Triad (now Vice Chairman Joint Chief of Staff),
agrees with Schneider: "Hypersonic capabilities are a significant
challenge. We are going to need a different set of sensors to see
hypersonic threats. Our enemies know that."

[Russia deployed]{.underline} its first regiment of SS-19 ICBMs armed
with [hypersonic Avangard nuclear warheads at the end of December
2019.]{.underline}

[Hypersonic vehicles fly over most of their trajectory at 50-100
kilometers altitude: the optimum height-of-burst for Super-EMP
warheads]{.underline}

Hypersonic weapons are potentially a new avenue for surprise nuclear
HEMP attack that could defeat deterrence. We cannot see the attack
coming and may not know against whom to retaliate, especially if HEMP
attack blinds satellites and radars needed for early-warning and threat
assessment.

**[Hypersonically delivered HEMP attack could win World War III with a
single electronic blow.]{.underline}**

HEMP Satellites? During the Cold War, the USSR developed a secret weapon
called the Fractional Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS). The FOBS would
disguise a nuclear attack as a peaceful satellite launch, orbiting a
nuclear-armed satellite over the South Pole to attack the U.S. from the
south--- from which direction the U.S. is blind and defenseless as there
are no BMEWS radars or antimissile defenses facing south. The FOBS
satellite could deliver a HEMP attack paralyzing U.S. retaliatory forces
and C3I in the first shot of a nuclear war. Miroslav Gyurosi in The
Soviet Fractional Orbital Bombardment System describes Moscow\'s
development of the FOBS as part of \"a long running campaign of
strategic deception against the West through the whole Cold War period,
and the protracted development of the Soviet FOBS nuclear weapon system
presents an excellent case study of such.\" Gyurosi: "The Fractional
Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS) as it was known in the West, was a
Soviet innovation intended to exploit the limitations of U.S. BMEW radar
coverage. The idea behind FOBS was that a large thermonuclear warhead
would be inserted into a steeply inclined low altitude polar orbit, such
that it would approach the CONUS from any direction, but primarily from
the southern hemisphere, and following a programmed braking maneuver,
re-enter from a direction which was not covered by U.S. BMEW radars."

\"**[The first warning the U.S. would have of such a strike in progress
would be the EMP]{.underline}**\...,\" writes Gyurosi.

Russia has the technical capability to clandestinely orbit a
nuclear-armed satellite or satellites to be maintained in orbit for
years until needed to make a surprise HEMP attack against the U.S., NATO
Europe, or some other target. If Russia is orbiting nuclear-armed
satellites for HEMP surprise attack, this would be one of their deepest
and best protected military secrets. In addition to obvious strategic
considerations, the Outer Space Treaty bans orbiting nuclear weapons in
space. Moreover, Russia has pursued a long propaganda offensive
criticizing the U.S. for "militarizing space" intended to deter the U.S.
from orbiting space-based missile defenses and from improving U.S.
military capabilities in space. HEMP attacks by satellite or missiles or
in combination could be the key to Russian victory in a nuclear war, as
U.S. strategic bombers, missiles, and C3I are not hardened to survive
attack by Super-EMP weapons, as noted in testimony before the House
Armed Services Committee by Dr. William Graham, Chairman of the EMP
Commission: MR. BARTLETT: "It is my understanding that, in interviewing
some Russian generals, that they told you that the Soviets had developed
a 'Super-EMP' enhanced weapon that could produce 200 kilovolts per meter
at the center?\...This is about, what, four times higher than anything
we ever built or tested to, in terms of EMP hardening?" DR. GRAHAM:
"Yes." MR. BARTLETT: "Which means that, even if you were some hundreds
of miles away from that, that it would be somewhere in the range of 50
to 100 kilovolts per meter at the margins of our country, for instance?"
DR. GRAHAM: "Yes. Over much of the margin." MR. BARTLETT: "So, we aren't
sure that much of our military would still be operable after that robust
laydown. Is that correct?\...I also understand that we aren't certain
that we could launch, through a series of robust EMP laydowns, that we
could launch our intercontinental ballistic missiles?" DR. GRAHAM: "We
designed both the missiles and their bases and the strategic
communications systems during the Cold War to be able to survive and
operate through EMP fields on the order of 50 kilovolts per meter, which
was our concern at the time, before we realized that weapons could be
designed that had larger EMP fields." Russian President Vladimir Putin,
in a world televised speech on March 1, 2018, announced a new
heavy-ICBM, the most powerful ever made, called "Sarmat" ("Satan II" by
NATO) that is "invincible" because it can strike anywhere on Earth, and
even attack the U.S. by flying over the South Pole, like the FOBs. Putin
declared: "Not even future missile defense systems will offer any
trouble to the Russian rocket complex, Sarmat," HEMP Threat To U.S.
Submarines? HEMP attack could achieve for Russia a key objective the
USSR could not achieve during the Cold War---neutralizing U.S. ballistic
missile submarines at sea. Russian Super-EMP weapons could destroy or
degrade U.S. bombers, ICBMs, SSBNs in port and their strategic
C3I---including land-based VLF communications systems, TACAMO aircraft,
and other redundant means of strategic command and control used to
convey Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) to submarines hiding at sea.
Severing their communications links to the National Command Authority
would neutralize U.S. submarines, rendering them useless. HEMP could
also be used to attack submarines on patrol at sea directly. A
high-yield warhead (1 megaton or more) detonated for HEMP over the ocean
would cover an area 2,200 kilometers in radius, a zone nearly as large
as North America, with powerful E3 HEMP that would penetrate the ocean
depths and possibly damage or destroy the electronics of submarines on
patrol. Submarines would be especially vulnerable when deploying their
very long antennae---which they need to do precisely when trying to
receive EAMS.43 VOSTOK-18 On September 11-17, 2018, Russia's VOSTOK-18
was perhaps the largest military exercise in history, happening two
months after U.S. Department of Homeland Security revelations that
Russia penetrated hundreds of U.S. electric utilities with
cyber-weapons. A few significant highlights: VOSTOK-18 mobilized 300,000
troops, 36,000 tanks and other vehicles, 1,000 aircraft, and 80 ships.
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu described it as the largest
exercise since ZAPAD81, the largest Cold War exercise that, 40 years
ago, simulated invading NATO. VOSTOK-18 apparently utilized other forces
not advertised, including Russia's Mediterranean fleet fighting a real
war in Syria and the Strategic Rocket Forces Missile Armies, simulating
a global nuclear World War III. VOSTOK-18 was a joint Russia-China
exercise, signifying de facto alliance against the United States. Russia
and China conduct many joint military exercises. Their nuclear
collaboration began February 2001 in a combined nuclear war scenario
against the U.S. over Taiwan.46 The SinoRussian Friendship Treaty (July
2001) promises their military cooperation "will further strategic
stability and security around the world." VOSTOK-18, though conducted in
Siberia, may well be full-dress rehearsal for conquering NATO,
practicing new nuclear warfighting techniques. Siberian operations are
harder for the U.S. to monitor, so new strategies and tactics can be
exercised secretly.

[Russia's **new** nuclear doctrine]{.underline} (similar to
Khrushchev-era thinking, like a more aggressive version of Marshal
Sokolovsky's 1962 Military Strategy) [relies on]{.underline} [nuclear
firepower and relatively small armies]{.underline}, but highly mobile
and survivable, to knife through Europe in a week or two.49 [Russia's
new generation nuclear weapons for strategic HEMP attack and tactical
battlefield use make this possible.]{.underline}

Theoretically, Russian invasion of NATO by 300,000 troops, 36,000 tanks
and other vehicles, and 1,000 aircraft could overrun NATO paralyzed by
EMP attack and outgunned by tactical nuclear weapons 10-to-1. A single
nuclear weapon detonated 60 kilometers above NATO HQ in Brussels would
generate a paralyzing HEMP field from Poland to Scotland, like a magic
carpet to the English Channel.5 VOSTOK-18 practiced civil defense and
recovery operations unrivaled in the West. "Eastern Military District
engineer formation mopped-up in aftermath of a simulated technogenic
emergency during VOSTOK-18 maneuvers," according to the Russian Defense
Ministry, "The military engineers launched bridges and ferry crossings,
restored demolished roads, prepared passage through rubble...evacuated
the population, and cleared terrain of simulated explosive objects and
radioactive and chemical waste." These same operations could support an
invasion of NATO. But the most important part of VOSTOK-18 was invisible

[Russian]{.underline} and Chinese [military doctrine also advocates a
revolutionary new way of warfare rendering obsolete traditional military
power by relying on cyber-attacks, sabotage, and EMP]{.underline} to
collapse adversary electric grids and life-sustaining critical
infrastructures, thereby achieving victory.

As a unit of measurement, a [nanometer is 10\^9 meters (or one billionth
of a meter)]{.underline}; it is roughly one 50,000th of a strand of hair
and is commonly used in the measuring of atoms and molecules. In 1959,
Nobel Prize winner and famous physicist Richard Feynman first proposed
in a lecture entitled \"There\'s Plenty of Room at the Bottom\" that
[humans might be able to create molecule-sized micro-machines in the
future and that it would be another **tech**nological
**revolution**]{.underline}. At the time, Feynman\'s ideas were
ridiculed, but [subsequent developments in science soon proved him to be
a true visionary]{.underline}. [In 1981, scientists developed the
scanning tunneling microscope and finally reached nano-level cognition.
In 1990, IBM scientists wrote the three letters \"IBM\" on a nickel
substrate by moving thirty-five xenon atoms one by one, demonstrating
that nanotechnology had become capable of transporting single
atoms.]{.underline} Most of the matter around us exists in molecule
forms, which are composed of atoms. The ability to move atoms signaled
an ability to perform marvelous feats. For example, we could move carbon
atoms to form diamonds, or pick out all the gold atoms in low-grade gold
mines. However, nanotechnology would not achieve any goals of real
significance if solely reliant on manpower. There are hundreds of
millions of atoms in a needle-tip-sized area---even if a person
committed their life to moving these atoms, no real value could be
achieved. [Real breakthroughs in nanotechnology could only be produced
by nanobots]{.underline}. Scientists imagined building molecule-sized
robots to move atoms and achieve goals; these were nanobots. On the
basis of this hypothesis, scientists further postulated the future of
nanotechnology; for example, nanobots might be able to enter the
bloodstream and dispose of cholesterol deposited in the veins; nanobots
could track cancer cells in the body and kill them at their weakest
moment; nanobots could instantly turn newly-cut grass into bread;
nanobots could transform recycled steel into a brand new-car in seconds.
In short, the future of nanotechnology seemed incredibly bright. This
was not the extent of nanotechnology\'s power. [Scientists also
discovered that nanotechnology could change the properties of materials.
In 1991, when studying C60, scientists discovered carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) that were only a few nanos in diameter]{.underline}. The carbon
nanotube became known as the king of nano materials due to its superb
properties; scientists believed that it would produce great results when
applied to nanobots. [Later, scientists]{.underline} also [developed a
type of synthetic molecular motor that derived energy from the
high-energy adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that powered intracellular
chemical reactions. The success of molecular motor research solved the
core component problem of nano machines;]{.underline} any molecular
motor grafted with other components could turn into a nano machine, and
nanobots could use them for motivation. [In]{.underline} May [**2004**,
American chemists developed the world's first nanobot]{.underline}: a
bipedal molecular robot that looked like a compass with
ten-nanometer-long legs. This nanobot was composed of DNA fragments,
including thirty-six base pairs, and it could \"stroll\" on plates in
the laboratory. [In April 2005, Chinese scientists developed nano-scale
robotic prototypes as well. In June of 2013, the Tohoku University used
peptide protein micro-tablets to successfully create nanobots that could
enter cells and move on the cell membrane]{.underline}. [In July
**2017**, researchers]{.underline} at the University of Rome and the
Roman Institute of Nanotechnology [announced the development of a new
synthetic molecular motor that was bacteria-driven and light-controlled.
The next step would be to get nanobots to move atoms or
molecules]{.underline}. Compared to the value produced by a nanobot,
they are extremely expensive to create. The small size of nanobots means
that although they can accomplish meaningful tasks, they are often very
inefficient. Even if a nanobot toiled day and night, its achievements
would only be calculated in terms of atoms, making its practical total
attainment relatively small. [Scientists came up with a solution for
this problem. They decided to prepare two sets of instructions when
programming nanobots. The first set of instructions would set out tasks
for the nanobot, while the second set would order the nanobot to
**self-replicate**. Since nanobots are capable of moving atoms and are
themselves composed of atoms, self-replication would be **fairly
easy**]{.underline}. One nanobot could replicate into ten, then a
hundred, and then a thousand . . . [**billions could be replicated in a
short period of time**. This army of nanobots would greatly increase
their efficiency]{.underline}. [One troublesome question that arises
from this scenario is: how would nanobots know when to stop
self-replicating? Human bodies and all of Earth are composed of atoms;
the unceasing replication of nanobots could **easily swallow humanity
and the entire planet**. If these nanobots were accidentally
**transported to other planets by cosmic dust**, the same fate would
befall those planets]{.underline}. This is a truly terrifying prospect.
Some [scientists are confident that they can control the
situation]{.underline}. They believe that [it is possible to design
nanobots that are programmed to self-destruct]{.underline} after several
generations of replication, [or]{.underline} even nanobots that [only
self-replicate in specific conditions]{.underline}. For example, a
nanobot that dealt with garbage refurbishing could be programmed to only
self-replicate around trash using trash. Although [these
ideas]{.underline} are worthy, they [are **too
idealistic**]{.underline}. Some more rational scientists have posed
these questions: [What would happen if nanobots **malfunctioned** and
did not terminate their self-replication? What would happen if
scientists **accidentally forgot** to add self-replication controls
during programming? What if **immoral** scientists **purposefully**
designed nanobots that would not stop self-replicating? Any one of the
above scenarios would be **enough** to destroy both humanity and
Earth.]{.underline} Chief scientist of Sun Microsystems, Bill [Joy, is a
leading, world-renowned scientist in the computer technology
field]{.underline}. In April of 1999, he pointed out that if misused,
[nanotechnology could be more devastating than nuclear weapons. If
nanobots self-replicated uncontrollably, they could become the cancer
that **engulfs the universe**. If we are not careful, nanotechnology
might become the Pandoras box that **destroys the entire universe** and
all of humanity with it.]{.underline} We all understand that [one locust
is insignificant, but hundreds of millions of locusts can destroy all in
their path]{.underline}. If self-replicating nanobots are really
achieved in the future, it might signify the end of humanity. If that
day came, [nothing could stop unethical scientists from designing
nanobots that suited their immoral purposes]{.underline}. [Humans are
**not far** from mastering nanotechnology. The **extremely tempting**
prospects of nanotechnology have **propelled** research of nanobots and
nanotechnology. The major science and technology nations have
**devoted** particular efforts to this field]{.underline}.

### 1NC\-\--Warming

\* edited for clarity

As people across the globe mobilize to demand bold action to combat the
climate crisis and scientific findings about looming "environmental
breakdown" pile up, [a startling new study published Monday in the
journal Nature Geoscience warns that human-caused global warming could
cause stratocumulus clouds to totally disappear **in as little as a
century**, triggering up to 8°C (14°F) of additional
warming.]{.underline}

[Stratocumulus clouds cover about two-thirds of the Earth and help keep
\*~~it~~ \[Earth\] cool by reflecting solar radiation back to
space]{.underline}. Recent [research has suggested that planetary
warming correlates with greater cloud loss, stoking fears about a
feedback loop that **could spell disaster**]{.underline}.

For this study, [researchers at the California Institute of Technology
used a supercomputer simulation to explore what could lead these
low-lying, lumpy clouds to vanish completely]{.underline}. As science
journalist Natalie Wolchover laid out in a lengthy piece for Quanta
Magazine titled A World Without Clouds:

The simulation revealed a tipping point: a level of warming at which
stratocumulus clouds break up altogether. The disappearance occurs when
the concentration of CO2 in the simulated atmosphere reaches 1,200 parts
per million \[ppm\]---[a level that fossil fuel burning could push us
past in about a century, under "business-as-usual" emissions scenarios.
In the simulation, when the tipping point is breached]{.underline},
[Earth's temperature soars 8 degrees Celsius, in addition to the 4
degrees of warming or more caused by the CO2 directly...]{.underline}

[To imagine 12 degrees of warming, think of crocodiles swimming in the
Arctic and of the scorched, mostly lifeless equatorial
regions]{.underline} during the \[Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum or
PETM\]. [If carbon emissions aren't curbed quickly enough and the
tipping point is breached, "that would be truly **devastating climate
change,"**]{.underline} said Caltech's Tapio Schneider, who performed
the new simulation with Colleen Kaul and Kyle Pressel.

[The study elicited alarm]{.underline} from climate campaigners along
[with calls for the "**radical, disruptive changes"** to society's
energy and economic systems that **scientists and experts have
repeatedly said are necessary** to prevent climate
catastrophe:]{.underline}

[Any nuclear weapon detonated in outer space,]{.underline} 30 kilometers
or higher, [will generate a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse
(HEMP]{.underline}). [**No blast, thermal, fallout or effects other than
HEMP are experienced** in the atmosphere and on the ground]{.underline}.
A nuclear detonation at 30 kilometers altitude will generate a HEMP
field with a radius on the ground of 600 kilometers, damaging all kinds
of electronics, blacking-out electric grids and collapsing other
life-sustaining critical infrastructures. Detonated at 400 kilometers
altitude, the radius of the HEMP field will be about 2,200 kilometers,
large enough to cover most of North America.

[Russia has]{.underline} what they term "[Super-EMP"
weapons]{.underline}, nuclear [warheads specialized for HEMP
attack]{.underline}. [Super-EMP warheads have very low explosive
yield]{.underline} (10 kilotons or less) **[but very high gamma
yield]{.underline}**, which is what generates HEMP. According to Russian
military and technical sources, [Super-EMP weapons can generate HEMP
fields of 100,000 volts/meter or higher, **greatly exceeding the U.S.
military hardening standard** for HEMP (50,000
volts/meter).]{.underline}

[**Russian military doctrine**, because HEMP attacks electronics,
**categorizes nuclear HEMP attack as a dimension of Information Warfare,
Electronic Warfare and Cyber Warfare**, which are modes of warfare
operating within the electromagnetic spectrum.]{.underline}

Commonplace cyber-theft, e-mail disruptions, and hacking, widely
regarded as annoyances by most Americans, could foreshadow catastrophic
nuclear HEMP attacks on the grid that would threaten the existence of
society. In Nazi Germany\'s blitzkrieg strategy, probing by their
motorcycle corps and scout planes, looking for weakness, preceded the
massed onslaught of heavy armored divisions. The same principle may be
at work in cyber-space with probing attacks from Russia, China, North
Korea and Iran. From the perspective of adversary military doctrine on
Electronic Warfare and Cyber Warfare, cyber-thefts and intrusions look
less like isolated cases of theft and hacking and more like probing U.S.
defenses and gauging Washington's reactions---perhaps in preparation for
an all-out cyber offensive that would include physical sabotage, radio
frequency weapons, and ultimately nuclear HEMP attack. Russian HEMP
Tests The Soviet Union discovered the high-altitude electromagnetic
pulse (HEMP) phenomenon probably years before the United States.
High-altitude nuclear testing at its Novaya Zemlya site would have
exposed the Russian cities of Archangel and Murmansk and electric grids
on the Kola Peninsula to HEMP effects. Moreover, Russia being located at
a higher northern latitude than most of the U.S., on the same latitude
as Canada and Alaska, meant greater exposure to geomagnetic storms and
their EMP/GMD effects on communications and power grids, an awareness
reflected in their military writings. On October 22, 1962, the Soviet
Union conducted a high-altitude EMP test---Nuclear Test 184--- over part
of its own territory, deliberately exposing Kazakhstan\'s electric grid
to HEMP as an experiment. \"These EMP producing tests were done over a
large populated land mass in Kazakhstan,\" writes Jerry Emanuelson in
his study of Test 184, \"Even though the economic state of Kazakhstan in
1962 was quite primitive by today\'s standards, it was heavily
industrialized and electrified.\" The HEMP field generated by Nuclear
Test 184 covered all of Kazakhstan. Emanuelson: "Test 184 was detonated
at 290 kilometers above a point that was 180 miles due west of
Zhezgazghan\....At an altitude of 290 kilometers above the detonation
point in central Kazakhstan, the distance to the horizon would have been
more than 1900 kilometers, which would have caused an electromagnetic
pulse over all of Kazakhstan." Data from Nuclear Test 184, the results
of which were kept secret for over thirty years, were partially shared
with the West in a briefing by Russian General Vladimir M. Loberev in
1994. Nuclear Test 184 confirmed definitively for the Soviets in 1962
what the United States concluded independently by extrapolation from the
U.S. STARFISH PRIME and other nuclear test results (conducted over the
Pacific Ocean), and from experiments conducted over 50 years using EMP
simulators and by computer modeling. Nuclear Test 184 destroyed
transformers, generators, communications, switches and all manner of
electronics within an enormous footprint extending hundreds of
kilometers---thereby proving the advantages and dangers of HEMP attack
empirically. Monstrous and unethical as may have been the USSR\'s
decision to conduct an HEMP test against their own people, Nuclear Test
184 and other tests armed the Soviet Union with the best HEMP data in
the world in 1962. Nuclear Test 184 was part of a series of seven Soviet
nuclear HEMP tests conducted over the USSR\'s own territory, mostly over
Kazakhstan, commencing on September 6, 1961, and ending on November 1,
1962. Whereas the U.S. was surprised by its discovery of HEMP during its
1962 nuclear test STARFISH PRIME, the Soviets were already aware of HEMP
during their nuclear test series and were very well prepared with a
large array of scientific instruments all over Kazakhstan to test and
investigate HEMP effects from actual high-altitude nuclear detonations
in a way that has never been approximated by the United States or any
other nation. The first two Soviet HEMP nuclear tests, on September 6,
1961, and October 6, 1961, were codenamed \"Thunderstorm\" and
\"Thunder\" perhaps reflecting the HEMP mission. All of the tests were
very realistic, using military ballistic missiles, mostly the SS-4
medium-range missile, to deliver and detonate the warheads at
high-altitude. The HEMP tests used a wide variety of warheads, with
yields ranging from merely 1.2 kilotons to 300 kilotons, detonated at
greatly varying altitudes, ranging from 22.7 kilometers to 300
kilometers height-of-burst. There is no question that as a result of its
HEMP nuclear test series, the Soviet Union, and today Russia, probably
knows a lot more about HEMP effects than the United States. \"In 1962,
the then Soviet Union conducted several high-altitude nuclear tests in
Kazakhstan in the course of which were obtained vast facts on the damage
levels from HEMP illuminating both military and civil systems,\" writes
Russian scientist Vasiliy Greetsai today. \"Most of those \'vast facts\'
are apparently still kept secretly at the Russian Federation Ministry of
Defense at the Central Institute of Physics in Sergiev Posad, Russia,\"
warns Emanuelson in his study of Test 184, \"Only a tiny amount of those
facts have been publicly released, but those facts have been extremely
informative.\" Russia Shares Some HEMP Data Why did Russia share any
HEMP nuclear test data with the West, and why just Nuclear Test 184 in
particular? It is generally assumed that Russian General Loberev\'s 1994
briefing on Nuclear Test 184 to an international audience was a benign
act, part of the post-Cold War thaw in relations under the pro-Western
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. However, a less benign interpretation
of the facts is possible. Perhaps the Russian General Staff approved
Loberev\'s 1994 briefing to the West on Nuclear Test 184 because they
hope to mislead the United States on the real severity of the threat and
preserve U.S. vulnerability to HEMP attack. Emanuelson in his study of
Test 184 observes that the nuclear weapon used for this test---as
impressive as were the results---was an inefficient design for HEMP, and
probably produced weaker HEMP fields than the U.S. STARFISH PRIME
nuclear test. Nor have the Russians disclosed, even for Test 184, the
strength of the peak HEMP fields that can do the most damage.20 Yet
among Western specialists Test 184 has become a sort of \"gold
standard\" that rivals in importance STARFISH PRIME as a basis for
designing HEMP protection Moscow jealously guards the secrets of its
other HEMP nuclear tests---that includes more than the seven
high-altitude detonations for the 1961-62 test series. Most Western
analysts assume that Russia is sharing its best data by disclosing Test
184. Even the usually meticulous Emanuelson appears to jump to this
conclusion: \"The first two of the K Project high altitude nuclear tests
(in 1961) over Kazakhstan were only 1.2 kilotons so the
EMP\...apparently did not have much of an impact on the 1961
infrastructure of Kazakhstan." But we do not know the impact of these
HEMP tests, because Moscow is not telling. Perhaps significantly, at
least one of these Soviet HEMP tests was conducted in an Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) mode, involving a high-altitude interception of a target.
Moreover, all of the tests were conducted over the Saryshagan ABM test
range.22 One design of a Soviet ABM warhead is like an Enhanced
Radiation Warhead, a warhead having low explosive yield but capable of
producing lots of neutrons, x-rays, gamma rays and other radiation to
kill incoming warheads. Such a weapon, low-yield but emitting enhanced
gamma rays that make high-frequency HEMP, could produce an
extraordinarily powerful HEMP field, tantamount to a Super-EMP warhead.
Is it possible that Moscow discovered, by accident or design, the secret
for making a Super-EMP nuclear weapon in 1961? Did Moscow share data
from Nuclear Test 184 in 1994 because they want to disinform the United
States and its allies about the real maximum HEMP threat, so that the
West will under-prepare, and remain vulnerable to Super-EMP?

[Russian HEMP Threats Russia\'s Super-EMP weapons]{.underline}---[that
**have no counterpart in the U.S. nuclear arsenal**]{.underline}---and
Russia\'s superior defensive preparations against HEMP, may have
emboldened the Russian Duma in 1999 to threaten an HEMP attack against
the United States for NATO\'s bombing of Russian ally Serbia. As
witnessed by the U.S. congressional delegation to Vienna, meeting with
their counterparts from the Russian Duma, Vladimir Lukin, Chairman of
the Duma International Affairs Committee, and Deputy Chairman Alexander
Shabonov, threatened:

LUKIN---\"Hypothetically, if Russia really wanted to hurt the United
States in retaliation for NATO\'s bombing of Yugoslavia, Russia could
fire a submarine launched ballistic missile and detonate a single
nuclear warhead at high-altitude over the United States. The resulting
electromagnetic pulse would massively disrupt U.S. communications and
computer systems, shutting down everything. No internet. Nothing.\"
SHABANOV---"And if that didn't work, we'd just launch another missile."
Moscow's threatened nuclear HEMP attack on the U.S. to the face of an
official congressional delegation was a contributing factor to the
establishment of the EMP Commission. Indeed, Moscow frequently
flourishes its nuclear saber to threaten the United States, as if
emboldened by knowledge of some decisive nuclear advantage, like
Super-EMP weapons and HEMP attack. For example, Russian General Staff
Chief Nikolai Makarov threatened a preemptive strike against NATO
anti-missile sites in Poland and the Czech Republic in 2012.24
Increasingly aggressive nuclear threats have been made by Russia in
2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and especially after Vladimir Putin's March
1, 2018 announcement of new nuclear super-weapons, that Putin threatened
will compel the U.S. to, "Listen to us now!"25 According to former
senior Defense Department official, Dr. Mark Schneider: "Between October
24, 2018 and March 2019, the nuclear missile targeting threat was made
at least 11 times at the highest levels---by President Putin, by the
Chief of the General Staff of the Army Valery Gerasimov, by the
Strategic Missile Force Commander Colonel General Sergei Ryabkov."26 Yet
despite all Russia\'s nuclear preparations and threats, Moscow still
fears a HEMP attack. A Norwegian scientific rocket, launched on January
25, 1995, to explore the aurora borealis, was mistaken by the Russian
military as a surprise HEMP attack launched by a U.S. submarine---nearly
resulting in a massive Russian preemptive strike. This still little
known incident, happening a half decade after the end of the Cold War,
is the closest the sides have ever come to nuclear conflict, triggered
by the specter of surprise HEMP attack.

[Russian Military Doctrine]{.underline}: [HEMP Attack Decisive Russian
General Vladimir Slipchenko in his military textbook Non-Contact Wars
describes the]{.underline} combined [use of]{.underline} cyber viruses
and hacking, physical attacks, non-nuclear EMP weapons, and ultimately
nuclear [HEMP attack against electric grids and critical infrastructures
as a new way of warfare that is the greatest Revolution in Military
Affairs (RMA) in history]{.underline}. [Slipchenko sees EMP as such a
departure from traditional ways and means of warfare]{.underline} that
he describes EMP weapons and warfare as "based on new physical
principles"---a phrase that has become ubiquitous in Russian literature
to describe the military revolution that is EMP:

"In practically all preceding generations of wars...weapons were
employed that acted against targets primarily by kinetic, chemical and
thermal energy. In addition to these arms...new ones will also
appear...in wars of the future...Weapons based on new physical
principles having an electromagnetic effect will see considerable
development. They will represent a form of casualty and damage producing
effect on targets through the energy of electromagnetic emissions of
various wavelengths and levels of power generated by radio frequency and
laser weapons and by means of electronic countermeasures using a
conventional or high-altitude nuclear burst...Depending on the power of
emission, such weapons will be capable of...suppressing practically all
classic electronic equipment...causing the melting or evaporation of
metal in the printed circuit boards...or causing structural changes of
electronic elements..."

Like Nazi Germany's "Blitzkrieg" ("Lightning War") strategy that
coordinated airpower, armor, and mobile infantry to achieve strategic
and technological surprise that nearly defeated the Allies in World War
II[, the "New Blitzkrieg" is, literally and figuratively, an electronic
"Lightning War"]{.underline} so potentially decisive in its effects that
an entire civilization could be overthrown in hours. [According to
General Slipchenko]{.underline}, [EMP and the new military revolution
renders obsolete modern armies, navies and air forces]{.underline}. For
the first time in history, small nations or even non-state actors can
humble the most advanced nations on Earth.

An article in Military Thought, the flagship journal of the Russian
General Staff, "Weak Points of the U.S. Concept of Network-Centric
Warfare" points to nuclear HEMP attack as a means of defeating the
United States: "American forces may be vulnerable to electronic warfare
attacks, in particular, an electromagnetic pulse that is a brief
powerful electromagnetic field capable of overloading or destroying
numerous electronic systems and high-tech microcircuits that are very
sensitive to the electromagnetic field, even if transmitted from a
distance. A single low-yield nuclear weapon exploded for this purpose
high above the area of combat operations can generate an electromagnetic
pulse covering a large area and destroying electronic equipment without
loss of life that is caused by the blast or radiation." Moreover:
"Today, too, a considerable body of administrative information in the
U.S. armed forces goes through the civilian Internet. Many civilian
commercial communication satellites, particularly satellites in low
orbits, can have their functions impaired or they can be disabled by
electromagnetic shocks from high altitudes."

According to another [Russian article: "Nuclear war strategy has already
planned nuclear explosions at an altitude of 50-100 km to destroy enemy
satellites' electronic instruments with electromagnetic
pulse":]{.underline}

"There are now about 683 space craft in near-earth orbit. Of these about
150 are Russian and about 400 American. In the estimation of
specialists, for every 100 of our 'purely' military espionage artificial
earth satellites there are 300 civilian satellites. Clearly, this
discrepancy will increase both quantitatively and qualitatively
(considering the state of the Russian military industrial
complex)...Nuclear war strategy has already planned nuclear explosions
at an altitude of 50-100 km to destroy enemy satellites' electronic
instruments with an electromagnetic pulse."

A 2015 article from [Russia's A.A. Maksimov Scientific Research
Institute for Space Systems, alludes to low-yield nuclear enhanced-EMP
as **the most effective cyber weapon**]{.underline}: "Even more
effective are remote-controlled cyber weapons in the nuclear variant,
but in this case a warhead is required with a capacity many times
smaller by comparison with the charges of the typical strategic
missiles."

["**Super-EMP is a...first-strike weapon**," according to Aleksey
Vaschenko,]{.underline} who describes Russian nuclear weapons specially
designed to make extraordinarily powerful EMP fields as Russia's means
for defeating the United States in "A Nuclear Response To America Is
Possible":

"The further direction of the work on the development of Super-EMP was
associated with the increase of its kill effect by focusing Y-radiation,
which should have resulted in an increase of the pulse's amplitude.
These properties of Super-EMP make it a first strike weapon, which is
designed to disable the state and military command and control system,
the economy, ICBMs, especially mobile based ICBMs, missiles on the
flight trajectory, radar sites, spacecraft, energy supply systems, and
so forth. So, Super-EMP is obviously offensive in nature and is a
destabilizing firststrike weapon...[The Russian nuclear component
**relies on the Super-EMP factor**, which is the Russian response to
U.S. nuclear blackmail]{.underline}."

Hypersonic Warheads: New HEMP Threat Russian development of hypersonic
missile warheads is a dangerous new dimension of the nuclear and HEMP
threat. Great speed (Mach 20, twenty times the speed of sound) and
flying a flat trajectory, skimming along the top of the upper
atmosphere, significantly reduces visibility to U.S. early-warning
satellites and radars, while also reducing arrival time. Maneuvering
makes hypersonic warheads more difficult to track and intercept,
virtually impossible to intercept with existing U.S. National Missile
Defenses. Former senior Defense Department official Dr. Mark Schneider
writes, "The main reason for Russian hypersonic missiles is a nuclear
surprise attack and America has no defense against it."3 Four-star
General John Hyten, then chief of the U.S. Strategic Command that
controls the nuclear Triad (now Vice Chairman Joint Chief of Staff),
agrees with Schneider: "Hypersonic capabilities are a significant
challenge. We are going to need a different set of sensors to see
hypersonic threats. Our enemies know that."

[Russia deployed]{.underline} its first regiment of SS-19 ICBMs armed
with [hypersonic Avangard nuclear warheads at the end of December
2019.]{.underline}

[Hypersonic vehicles fly over most of their trajectory at 50-100
kilometers altitude: the optimum height-of-burst for Super-EMP
warheads]{.underline}

Hypersonic weapons are potentially a new avenue for surprise nuclear
HEMP attack that could defeat deterrence. We cannot see the attack
coming and may not know against whom to retaliate, especially if HEMP
attack blinds satellites and radars needed for early-warning and threat
assessment.

**[Hypersonically delivered HEMP attack could win World War III with a
single electronic blow.]{.underline}**

HEMP Satellites? During the Cold War, the USSR developed a secret weapon
called the Fractional Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS). The FOBS would
disguise a nuclear attack as a peaceful satellite launch, orbiting a
nuclear-armed satellite over the South Pole to attack the U.S. from the
south--- from which direction the U.S. is blind and defenseless as there
are no BMEWS radars or antimissile defenses facing south. The FOBS
satellite could deliver a HEMP attack paralyzing U.S. retaliatory forces
and C3I in the first shot of a nuclear war. Miroslav Gyurosi in The
Soviet Fractional Orbital Bombardment System describes Moscow\'s
development of the FOBS as part of \"a long running campaign of
strategic deception against the West through the whole Cold War period,
and the protracted development of the Soviet FOBS nuclear weapon system
presents an excellent case study of such.\" Gyurosi: "The Fractional
Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS) as it was known in the West, was a
Soviet innovation intended to exploit the limitations of U.S. BMEW radar
coverage. The idea behind FOBS was that a large thermonuclear warhead
would be inserted into a steeply inclined low altitude polar orbit, such
that it would approach the CONUS from any direction, but primarily from
the southern hemisphere, and following a programmed braking maneuver,
re-enter from a direction which was not covered by U.S. BMEW radars."

\"**[The first warning the U.S. would have of such a strike in progress
would be the EMP]{.underline}**\...,\" writes Gyurosi.

Russia has the technical capability to clandestinely orbit a
nuclear-armed satellite or satellites to be maintained in orbit for
years until needed to make a surprise HEMP attack against the U.S., NATO
Europe, or some other target. If Russia is orbiting nuclear-armed
satellites for HEMP surprise attack, this would be one of their deepest
and best protected military secrets. In addition to obvious strategic
considerations, the Outer Space Treaty bans orbiting nuclear weapons in
space. Moreover, Russia has pursued a long propaganda offensive
criticizing the U.S. for "militarizing space" intended to deter the U.S.
from orbiting space-based missile defenses and from improving U.S.
military capabilities in space. HEMP attacks by satellite or missiles or
in combination could be the key to Russian victory in a nuclear war, as
U.S. strategic bombers, missiles, and C3I are not hardened to survive
attack by Super-EMP weapons, as noted in testimony before the House
Armed Services Committee by Dr. William Graham, Chairman of the EMP
Commission: MR. BARTLETT: "It is my understanding that, in interviewing
some Russian generals, that they told you that the Soviets had developed
a 'Super-EMP' enhanced weapon that could produce 200 kilovolts per meter
at the center?\...This is about, what, four times higher than anything
we ever built or tested to, in terms of EMP hardening?" DR. GRAHAM:
"Yes." MR. BARTLETT: "Which means that, even if you were some hundreds
of miles away from that, that it would be somewhere in the range of 50
to 100 kilovolts per meter at the margins of our country, for instance?"
DR. GRAHAM: "Yes. Over much of the margin." MR. BARTLETT: "So, we aren't
sure that much of our military would still be operable after that robust
laydown. Is that correct?\...I also understand that we aren't certain
that we could launch, through a series of robust EMP laydowns, that we
could launch our intercontinental ballistic missiles?" DR. GRAHAM: "We
designed both the missiles and their bases and the strategic
communications systems during the Cold War to be able to survive and
operate through EMP fields on the order of 50 kilovolts per meter, which
was our concern at the time, before we realized that weapons could be
designed that had larger EMP fields." Russian President Vladimir Putin,
in a world televised speech on March 1, 2018, announced a new
heavy-ICBM, the most powerful ever made, called "Sarmat" ("Satan II" by
NATO) that is "invincible" because it can strike anywhere on Earth, and
even attack the U.S. by flying over the South Pole, like the FOBs. Putin
declared: "Not even future missile defense systems will offer any
trouble to the Russian rocket complex, Sarmat," HEMP Threat To U.S.
Submarines? HEMP attack could achieve for Russia a key objective the
USSR could not achieve during the Cold War---neutralizing U.S. ballistic
missile submarines at sea. Russian Super-EMP weapons could destroy or
degrade U.S. bombers, ICBMs, SSBNs in port and their strategic
C3I---including land-based VLF communications systems, TACAMO aircraft,
and other redundant means of strategic command and control used to
convey Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) to submarines hiding at sea.
Severing their communications links to the National Command Authority
would neutralize U.S. submarines, rendering them useless. HEMP could
also be used to attack submarines on patrol at sea directly. A
high-yield warhead (1 megaton or more) detonated for HEMP over the ocean
would cover an area 2,200 kilometers in radius, a zone nearly as large
as North America, with powerful E3 HEMP that would penetrate the ocean
depths and possibly damage or destroy the electronics of submarines on
patrol. Submarines would be especially vulnerable when deploying their
very long antennae---which they need to do precisely when trying to
receive EAMS.43 VOSTOK-18 On September 11-17, 2018, Russia's VOSTOK-18
was perhaps the largest military exercise in history, happening two
months after U.S. Department of Homeland Security revelations that
Russia penetrated hundreds of U.S. electric utilities with
cyber-weapons. A few significant highlights: VOSTOK-18 mobilized 300,000
troops, 36,000 tanks and other vehicles, 1,000 aircraft, and 80 ships.
Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu described it as the largest
exercise since ZAPAD81, the largest Cold War exercise that, 40 years
ago, simulated invading NATO. VOSTOK-18 apparently utilized other forces
not advertised, including Russia's Mediterranean fleet fighting a real
war in Syria and the Strategic Rocket Forces Missile Armies, simulating
a global nuclear World War III. VOSTOK-18 was a joint Russia-China
exercise, signifying de facto alliance against the United States. Russia
and China conduct many joint military exercises. Their nuclear
collaboration began February 2001 in a combined nuclear war scenario
against the U.S. over Taiwan.46 The SinoRussian Friendship Treaty (July
2001) promises their military cooperation "will further strategic
stability and security around the world." VOSTOK-18, though conducted in
Siberia, may well be full-dress rehearsal for conquering NATO,
practicing new nuclear warfighting techniques. Siberian operations are
harder for the U.S. to monitor, so new strategies and tactics can be
exercised secretly.

[Russia's **new** nuclear doctrine]{.underline} (similar to
Khrushchev-era thinking, like a more aggressive version of Marshal
Sokolovsky's 1962 Military Strategy) [relies on]{.underline} [nuclear
firepower and relatively small armies]{.underline}, but highly mobile
and survivable, to knife through Europe in a week or two.49 [Russia's
new generation nuclear weapons for strategic HEMP attack and tactical
battlefield use make this possible.]{.underline}

Theoretically, Russian invasion of NATO by 300,000 troops, 36,000 tanks
and other vehicles, and 1,000 aircraft could overrun NATO paralyzed by
EMP attack and outgunned by tactical nuclear weapons 10-to-1. A single
nuclear weapon detonated 60 kilometers above NATO HQ in Brussels would
generate a paralyzing HEMP field from Poland to Scotland, like a magic
carpet to the English Channel.5 VOSTOK-18 practiced civil defense and
recovery operations unrivaled in the West. "Eastern Military District
engineer formation mopped-up in aftermath of a simulated technogenic
emergency during VOSTOK-18 maneuvers," according to the Russian Defense
Ministry, "The military engineers launched bridges and ferry crossings,
restored demolished roads, prepared passage through rubble...evacuated
the population, and cleared terrain of simulated explosive objects and
radioactive and chemical waste." These same operations could support an
invasion of NATO. But the most important part of VOSTOK-18 was invisible

[Russian]{.underline} and Chinese [military doctrine also advocates a
revolutionary new way of warfare rendering obsolete traditional military
power by relying on cyber-attacks, sabotage, and EMP]{.underline} to
collapse adversary electric grids and life-sustaining critical
infrastructures, thereby achieving victory.

[The global economy is hurtling humanity toward extinction]{.underline}.
Greenhouse gas emissions are on track to warm the planet by six degrees
Celsius above preindustrial averages. A six-degree increase risks
killing most life on earth, as global warming did during the Late
Permian when volcanoes burned a bunch of fossilized carbon (e.g., coal,
oil, and gas). Called the [Great
Dying](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html),
that event was, according to New York Magazine, "The most notorious
\[extinction event...\]; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five
degrees, accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane
in the Arctic, and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead."

[Mainstream science
[suggests](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report)
that we're on our way there]{.underline}. During the winter of 2017,
[the Arctic grew warmer than Europe, sending snow to the Mediterranean
and Sahara]{.underline}. The planet may have already passed irreversible
thresholds that could accelerate further feedback loops like permafrost
melt and loss of polar ice. Patches of permafrost [aren't
freezing](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/22/scientists-surprised-arctic-ground-may-not-be-freezingeven-in-winter.html)
even during winter, necessitating a rename (may I suggest 'nevafrost'?).
In the summer of 2018, forests north of the Arctic Circle broke 90
degrees Fahrenheit and
[burned](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/19/europe/sweden-forest-fires-wxc-intl/index.html)
in vast wildfires. [We're reaching milestones far faster than scientists
have even recently predicted]{.underline}. As Guardian columnist George
Monbiot
[noted](https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot/status/968740684114092032),
"[The Arctic meltdown \[...\] is the kind of event scientists warned we
could face by 2050. Not by 2018."]{.underline} [Mass marine death that
rapidly emits uncontrollable greenhouse gasses is another **feedback
loop** that seems ready to strike. The ocean is now [more
acidic](https://phys.org/news/2018-07-ocean-acidification-million-years.html)
than any time in the last 14 million years, killing everything from
snails to whales]{.underline}. [It's growing rapidly more
acidic]{.underline}. Meanwhile, from the global South to wealthier
industrialized countries, [people are **already dying** and being
displaced from the impacts of extreme climate change via extreme
droughts, floods, wildfires, storms, and conflicts like the Syrian civil
war]{.underline}. [Authoritarianism is [on the
rise](https://newrepublic.com/article/148861/climate-change-authoritarian-leaders)
due directly to these climate emergencies and migrations.]{.underline}

[The IPCC has recently alerted the world that we have about a decade to
dramatically cut emissions before collapse becomes
inevitable]{.underline}. [We could prevent human extinction if we act
immediately. But the world is unanimously ignoring climate change.
Nations will almost certainly **fail to avert biosphere collapse**. That
is because doing so will **require a rapid decarbonization** of the
global economy.]{.underline}

But why does decarbonization\--an innocuous enough term\--seem so
implausible? Well, let's put it this way: a sufficient transition to
non-carbon energy would require all the trains, buses, planes, cars, and
ships in the world to almost immediately stop and be replaced with newly
manufactured vehicles to run on non-carbon fuel, like hydrogen cells,
renewable electricity, or some carbon-neutral biofuel. All this new
manufacturing will have to be done with low-carbon techniques, many of
which don't exist yet and may be impossible to achieve at scale. This
means all the complex supply chains that move most of the world's food,
water, medicine, basically all consumer goods, construction materials,
clothing, and everything else billions of people depend on to survive
will have to be fundamentally reformed, in virtually every way,
immediately.  

It also means that all the electric grids and indoor heating and cooling
systems in the world must be rapidly transformed from centralized coal
and gas power plants to a mixture of solar, wind, and nuclear---both
distributed and centralized---dispersed through newly built micro-grids
and smart-grids, and stored in new battery infrastructure. These new
solar panels, batteries, and nuclear plants will somehow have to be
built using little carbon energy, again something that may be impossible
to achieve at a global scale.

The cost of this transition is impossible to know, but surely reaches
the tens of trillions of dollars. It needs to happen in just about every
industrialized nation on the planet and needs to happen now---not in
2050, as the Paris Agreement dictates, or the 2030s, as reflected in
many governments' decarbonization goals. The engineering and
administrative obstacles are immense; disentangling century-old,
haphazard electric grid systems, for example, poses an almost
unimaginable cascade of institutional and logistical hurdles. Imagine
the difficulty of persuading millions of municipalities around the world
to do anything simultaneously; now, imagine convincing them all to
fundamentally shift the resource infrastructure on which their material
existence depends immediately.

Perhaps even more daunting are the political obstacles, [with diverse
financial interests woven together in a tapestry of inertia and
self-interest. Virtually all retirement funds, for instance, are
invested in fossil fuel companies. Former and current fossil fuel
industry managers sit on all manner of institutional committees in which
energy and investment decisions are made: trustee boards of
universities, regulatory commissions, city councils, congressional
committees, philanthropic boards, federal agencies, the Oval Office
couch]{.underline}. Lots of people make lots of money from fossil fuels.
[Will they sacrifice deeply vested interests to prevent
collapse]{.underline}? [They certainly have not shown signs of doing so
yet, when the stakes are as dire as they've ever been; most **have
instead ruthlessly** obstructed meaningful action]{.underline}. Will
enough people be willing to do what it takes to forcibly remove them
from the most powerful institutions in the world? That also seems
unlikely, given meager public involvement in this issue so far.

[This is the obstacle of collective action: everyone has to sacrifice,
but **no one wants to start**]{.underline}. Who will assent to giving up
their steady returns from fossil fuels if everyone else refuses? When
people are living so precariously as it is (43% of American can't afford
basic necessities), how can we ask them to undertake energy transition?
[The US drags its feet on decarbonizing and justifies it by arguing that
China has not made strong enough commitments. Which country will
voluntarily give up access to strategic fossil fuel reserves? Much of
our geopolitical dynamics and **wars have revolved around access** to
mineral resources like oil. Is the US going to put itself in a
disadvantaged position for the climate? Shell withdraws research funding
for renewables because ExxonMobil goes full steam ahead on oil, and,
hey, they must compete. Fossil fuel funded politicians of both parties
certainly **will not aid transition**.]{.underline}

If untangling the webs of influence, interests, and engineering
preventing decarbonization weren't daunting enough, [the world will also
have to suck billions of tons of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere
that have already been emitted]{.underline}. Keeping the planet to even
a deadly 1.5 degrees Celsius increase of warming depends on it.

This sounds simpler than it is, as if a big vacuum cleaner could siphon
particulates from the sky. But no one really knows how to extract and
sequester carbon at the scale necessary to prevent catastrophic climate
change. Engineers have thrown out a lot of ideas---some [more
plausible](https://www.the-trouble.com/content/2018/10/18/avoiding-climate-imperialism-a-leftist-vision-of-geoengineering)
than others---but most scientists who have looked at proposals generally
agree that it's wishful thinking. As Huffington Post
[quotes](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/adnan-aldaini/global-warming-delusions-_b_3175118.html)
Clive Hamilton, "In order to capture just a quarter of the emissions
from the world\'s coal-fired power plants we would need a system of
pipelines that would transport a volume of fluid twice the size of the
global crude-oil industry." Of course, manufacturing, shipping, and
constructing those pipelines would require immense carbon energy inputs
and emissions. And that's just to capture the emissions from coal!

Like energy transition, carbon capture and sequestration requires
governments to act collectively to invest trillions of dollars in risky,
experimental, and probably mostly ineffectual sequestration
technologies. Again, it's a collective action problem: nobody wants to
be the one to sacrifice while no one else is putting themselves on the
line. [And the miniscule likelihood that energy transition will occur
under a Trump-Digs-Coal presidency---and the Trumpian nationalists
[winning elections](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36130006)
across the
[world](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/01/bolsonaro-environment-agriculture-ministries-amazon)---casts
further doubt on the possibility of rapid decarbonization]{.underline}.
[The administration's energy department has
[projected](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/06022018/eia-trump-greenhouse-gas-emissions-rise-climate-change-natural-gas-wind-solar-energy)
that, "The carbon footprint of the United States will barely go down at
all for the foreseeable future and will be slightly higher in 2050," as
InsideClimateNews notes. The world, today, is still setting records for
carbon emissions and there's no sign that will change anytime
soon.]{.underline}

[The only period in US history the nation has undertaken anything near
the magnitude of **collective action necessary for mitigation** was
during the Second World War and the rebuilding effort in its
aftermath.]{.underline} But even those projects involved a fraction of
the capital and coordination that will be necessary for sufficient
energy transition and carbon sequestration. More importantly, today's
collective action will have to be politically justified without the
motivation of defeating a personified enemy---a Hitler, if you will.
Today, with interpersonal alienation running rampant and extremely
consolidated wealth and power, industrial economies seem infinitely far
from a cultural, political atmosphere in which collective action
policies are even close to possible. [To the contrary, wealthy countries
are all still slashing public goods, passing austerity budgets, and
investing heavily in fossil fuel infrastructure. Even most elected
Democrats are dragging their feet on passing climate policy. The world
is going in the exact opposite direction from one in which humans can
live.]{.underline}

[We've tied ourselves in a perfect Gordian knot.]{.underline}

The global economy is a vast machine, operating beyond the control of
even the most powerful individuals, and it has a will of its own to
consume and pollute. It's hard to believe that this massive metal beast
will be peacefully undone by the people who survive by it, and we all
survive by it in some way, often against our wills; it bribes and
entraps us all in ways large and small.

But a wrench could clog the gears, and maybe only a wrench can stop it.
One wrench that could slow climate disruption may be a large-scale
conflict that halts the global economy, destroys fossil fuel
infrastructure, and throws particulates in the air. At this point, with
~~insane~~ people like Trump, Putin, Xi, May, and Macron leading the
world's biggest nuclear powers, large-scale conflagration between them
would probably lead to a nuclear exchange. Nobody wants nuclear war.
Rather, ~~nobody sane and prosocial wants nuclear war~~. It is an
absolute horror that would burn and maim millions of living beings,
despoil millions of hectares, and scar the skin of the earth and dome of
the sky for centuries, maybe millennia. With proxy conflict brewing
between the US and Russia in the Middle East and the [Thucydides
trap](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/09/the-thucydides-trap/) ready to
ensnare us with an ascendant China, nuclear war looks like a more
realistic possibility than it has since the 1980s.

A devastating fact of climate collapse is that [there may be a s**ilver
lining to the mushroom cloud**.]{.underline} First, [it should be noted
that a nuclear **exchange does not inevitably result** in apocalyptic
loss of life]{.underline}. [Nuclear winter]{.underline}---the idea that
firestorms would make the earth uninhabitable---[is based on shaky
science]{.underline}. There's no reliable model that can determine how
many megatons would decimate agriculture or make humans extinct.
[Nations have already detonated 2,476 nuclear devices.]{.underline}

[An exchange that shuts down the global economy but stops short of human
extinction may be the **only blade realistically likely to cut** the
carbon knot we're trapped within]{.underline}. [It would decimate
existing infrastructures, providing an **opportunity to build new
energy** infrastructure and intervene in the current investments and
subsidies keeping fossil fuels alive.]{.underline}

In the near term, emissions would almost certainly rise as militaries
are some of the world's [largest
emitters](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/01/climate/us-biggest-carbon-polluter-in-history-will-it-walk-away-from-the-paris-climate-deal.html).
Given what we know of human history, though, [conflict may be the **only
way to build the mass social cohesion** necessary for undertaking the
kind of huge, **collective action needed for global sequestration** and
energy transition]{.underline}. Like the 20th century's world wars, [a
nuclear exchange could serve as an economic leveler. It could provide
justification for nationalizing energy industries with the interest of
shuttering fossil fuel plants and transitioning to renewables
and]{.underline}, uh, [nuclear energy]{.underline}. [It could shock us
into **reimagining** a less suicidal civilization, one that **dethrones
the death-cult zealots** who are currently in power]{.underline}. And it
may toss particulates into the atmosphere sufficient to block out some
of the solar heat helping to drive global warming. Or it may have the
opposite effects. Who knows?

[What we do know is that humans **can survive** and recover from war,
probably even a nuclear one. Humans **cannot recover** from **runaway
climate change**. Nuclear war is not an inevitable extinction event; six
degrees of warming is.]{.underline}

[Given that mostly violent, psychopathic individuals manage the
governments and industries of the world, it may only be possible for
anti-social collective action---that is, war---to halt, or at least
slow, our inexorable march toward oblivion]{.underline}. A courageous,
benevolent ruler might compel vast numbers of people to collective
action. But we have too few of those, and the legal, political, and
military barriers preventing them from rising are immense. [Our current
crop of villainous presidents, prime ministers, and CEOs, whether
lusting for chaos or pursuing their own petty ends, may inadvertently
conspire to break the machine now preventing our future]{.underline}.
When so bereft of heroes, [we may need to rely on humanity's antagonists
and their petty incompetence to accidentally save the day. It is a stark
reflection of how homicidal our economy is---and our collective
adherence to its whims---that nuclear war could be a **rational course
of action.**]{.underline}

A common theme across all these treatments of GCR is that some
catastrophes are vastly more important than others. Carl Sagan was
perhaps the first to recognize this, in his commentary on nuclear winter
(Sagan 1983). [Without nuclear winter, a global nuclear war might kill
several hundred million people.]{.underline} This is obviously a major
catastrophe, but **[humanity would presumably carry on.]{.underline}**
However, with nuclear winter, per Sagan, humanity could go extinct. The
loss would be not just an additional four billion or so deaths, but the
loss of all future generations. To paraphrase Sagan, [the loss would be
billions and billions of lives, or even more. **Sagan estimated 500
trillion lives**]{.underline}, [assuming humanity would continue for ten
million more years, which he cited as typical for a successful
species.]{.underline} **[Sagan's 500 trillion number may even be an
underestimate.]{.underline}** The analysis here takes an adventurous
turn, hinging on the evolution of the human species and the long-term
fate of the universe. On these long time scales, the descendants of
contemporary humans may no longer be recognizably "human". The issue
then is whether the descendants are still worth caring about, whatever
they are. If they are, then it begs the question of how many of them
there will be. **[Barring major global catastrophe, Earth will remain
habitable for about one billion more years until the Sun gets too warm
and large.]{.underline}** [The rest of the Solar System, Milky Way
galaxy, universe, and (if it exists) the multiverse will remain
habitable for a lot longer than that]{.underline} (Adams and Laughlin
1997), should our descendants gain the capacity to migrate there. An
open question in astronomy is whether it is possible for the descendants
of humanity to continue living for an infinite length of time or instead
merely an astronomically large but finite length of time (see e.g.
Ćirković 2002; Kaku 2005). Either way, **[the stakes with global
catastrophes could be much larger than the loss of 500 trillion
lives.]{.underline}**

"Civilizational collapse risks" [As most human societies are fairly
complex, a true]{.underline} civilizational [collapse would require a
drastic reduction in human population]{.underline}, and the break-down
of connections between surviving populations. **[Survivors would have to
rebuild civilization from scratch]{.underline}**, likely losing much
technological abilities and knowledge in the process. Hanson (2008)
**[estimated that the minimal human population able to survive is around
100 people]{.underline}**. Like X risks, there is little agreement on
what is required for civilizational collapse. Clearly, different types
and levels of the civilizational collapse are possible (Diamond, 2005)
(Meadows, Randers, & Meadows, 2004). For instance, one definition of the
collapse of civilization involves, collapse of long distance trade,
widespread conflict, and loss of government (Coates, 2009). How such
collapses relate to existential risk needs more research.

innocent civilians of a nation with a rogue leader might be killed. Such
a perceived lower risk of assured destruction by the United States, and
widespread knowledge about the vulnerability of U.S. civilian and
military computers to the effects of an EMP attack, could actually
create a new incentive for other countries or terrorist groups to
develop, or perhaps purchase, a nuclear capability.

#### Even if it does somehow escalate there's no extinction

James **Scouras 19**. Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics
Laboratory. Summer 2019. "Nuclear War as a Global Catastrophic Risk."
Journal of Benefit-Cost Analysis, vol. 10, no. 2, pp. 274--295.

While it is clear that [nuclear war]{.underline} is a global
catastrophic risk, [it is also clear that it is not an existential risk.
Yet over the course of the nuclear age, a series of mechanisms have been
proposed that, it has been erroneously argued, could lead to human
extinction.]{.underline} The first concern3 arose among physicists on
the Manhattan Project during a 1942  seminar at Berkeley some three
years before the first test of an atomic weapon. Chaired by Robert
Oppenheimer, it was attended by Edward Teller, Hans Bethe, Emil
Konopinski, and other theoretical physicists.4 They considered the
possibility that detonation of an atomic bomb could ignite a
self-sustaining nitrogen fusion reaction that might propagate through
earth's atmosphere, thereby extinguishing all air-breathing life on
earth. Konopinski, Cloyd Margin, and Teller eventually published the
calculations that led to the conclusion that the nitrogen-nitrogen
reaction was virtually impossible from atomic bomb
explosions---calculations that had previously been used to justify going
forward with Trinity, the first atomic bomb test.5 [Of course, the
Trinity test was conducted, as well as over 2000 (by all nations)
subsequent atomic and thermonuclear tests, and we are fortunately still
here breathing air]{.underline} After the bomb was used, extinction fear
focused on invisible and deadly fallout, unanticipated as a significant
consequence of the bombings of Japan that would spread by global air
currents to poison the entire planet. Public dread was reinforced by the
depressing, but influential, 1957 novel On the Beach by Nevil Shute
([1957](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-benefit-cost-analysis/article/nuclear-war-as-a-global-catastrophic-risk/EC726528F3A71ED5ED26307677960962/core-reader#ref36))
and the subsequent 1959 movie version (Kramer, 1959). The story
describes survivors in Melbourne, Australia, one of a few remaining
human outposts in the Southern Hemisphere, as fallout clouds approached
to bring the final blow to humanity. In the 1970s, after fallout was
better understood to be limited in space, time, and magnitude, depletion
of the ozone layer, which would cause increased ultraviolet radiation to
fry all humans who dared to venture outside, became the extinction
mechanism of concern. Again, one popular book, The Fate of the Earth by
Jonathan Schell
([1982](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-benefit-cost-analysis/article/nuclear-war-as-a-global-catastrophic-risk/EC726528F3A71ED5ED26307677960962/core-reader#ref34)),
which described the nuclear destruction of the ozone layer leaving the
earth "a republic of insects and grass," promoted this fear. Schell did
at times try to cover all bases, however: "To say that human extinction
is a certainty would, of course, be a misrepresentation -- just as it
would be a misrepresentation to say that extinction can be ruled out"
(Schell, [1982](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-benefit-cost-analysis/article/nuclear-war-as-a-global-catastrophic-risk/EC726528F3A71ED5ED26307677960962/core-reader#ref34)).
Finally, [the **current mechanism of concern** for extinction is nuclear
winter, the phenomenon by which dust and soot created primarily by the
burning of cities would rise to the stratosphere and attenuate sunlight
such that surface temperatures would decline dramatically, agriculture
would fail, and humans and other animals would perish from
famine]{.underline}. The public first learned of the possibility of
nuclear winter in a Parade article by Sagan
([1983](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-benefit-cost-analysis/article/nuclear-war-as-a-global-catastrophic-risk/EC726528F3A71ED5ED26307677960962/core-reader#ref31)),
published a month or so before its scientific counterpart by Turco et
al.
([1983](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-benefit-cost-analysis/article/nuclear-war-as-a-global-catastrophic-risk/EC726528F3A71ED5ED26307677960962/core-reader#ref40)).
[While some nuclear disarmament advocates promote the idea that nuclear
winter is an extinction threat, and the general public is probably
confused to the extent it is not disinterested**, few scientists seem to
consider it an extinction threat.**]{.underline} It is understandable
that some of these extinction fears were created by ignorance or
uncertainty and treated seriously by worst-case thinking, as seems
appropriate for threats of extinction. But [**nuclear doom mongering**
also seems to be at play for some of these episodes.]{.underline} For
some reason, [portions of the public active in nuclear issues, as well
as some scientists, appear to think that arguments for nuclear arms
reductions or elimination will be more persuasive if nuclear war is
believed to threaten extinction, rather than merely the horrific
cataclysm that it would be in reality]{.underline}
(Martin, [1982](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-benefit-cost-analysis/article/nuclear-war-as-a-global-catastrophic-risk/EC726528F3A71ED5ED26307677960962/core-reader#ref22)).[ 4](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-benefit-cost-analysis/article/nuclear-war-as-a-global-catastrophic-risk/EC726528F3A71ED5ED26307677960962/core-reader#fn4)
To summarize, nuclear war is a global catastrophic risk. Such wars may
cause billions of deaths and unfathomable suffering, as well set
civilization back centuries. Smaller nuclear wars pose regional
catastrophic risks and also national risks in that the continued
functioning of, for example, the United States as a constitutional
republic is highly dubious after even a relatively limited nuclear
attack. But what **[nuclear war is not is an existential risk to the
human race.]{.underline}** [There is simply no credible scenario in
which humans do not survive to repopulate the earth]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--AT: Grid

#### This is [ridiculous]{.underline} not everyone even [uses]{.underline} the grid and [mutual aid]{.underline} makes extinction *[impossible]{.underline}*

**Springer, 17**---University of Victoria (Simon, "The limits to Marx:
David Harvey and the condition of postfraternity," Dialogues in Human
Geography 2017, Vol. 7(3) 280--294, dml)

Yet since horizontal organizational tactics in anarchism are usually
part of a broader class struggle (Solidarity Federation, 2012), [it is
**absurd to suggest** that there would **ever be a time** where
anarchists would enter into assembly]{.underline}---federated or
otherwise---[**during a nuclear meltdown** or the **complex operation of
landing an airplane**]{.underline}. Indeed, [without a discernable
hierarchy to oppose, '**in what possible circumstance would collective
struggle be necessary** during such risky periods?']{.underline}
(fkshultze, 2013). [Nonetheless, **mutual aid** in times of
disaster---both natural and manufactured---is a **recurrent human
theme**, where people **regularly come together** and **organize
themselves effectively** around an ensuing crisis in the **complete
absence of a centralized authority**. We saw this with **spectacular
effect** in the wake of **Hurricane Katrina**]{.underline}, where the
state was more concerned with restoring 'law and order' and
criminalizing desperate people than it was with relief and rescue
efforts. [In response to the state's failure, people **instead helped
themselves** and **each other**, particularly through the formation of
the **Common Ground Collective**]{.underline}. For Kropotkin (2008
\[1902\]: 137), the tendency for mutual aid 'has so remote an origin,
and is so deeply interwoven with all the past evolution of the human
race, that it has been maintained \... notwithstanding all vicissitudes
of history'.

### 2NC\-\--AT: HEMPs

#### HEMPs are [harmless]{.underline}\-\--studies are [overhyped]{.underline} and *[STILL]{.underline}* conclude NEG

[There's little to no evidence to suggest that EMPs pose a physical
threat to humans. One of the main reasons]{.underline} low EMPs may not
harm humans directly [is that we're mostly made of water, and our body
isn't very conductive.]{.underline} However, the conclusion from most
studies is that EMPs at high levels may directly harm humans. Some of
the possible effects on humans include: Cellular mutations Internal
burns Nervous system damage Brain damage EMPs may also affect pacemakers
and other implanted devices. Because they're electronic devices, they
can become damaged if an EMP occurs. The extent of damage will depend on
the level of the EMP and the person's proximity to it. Long Exposure
Could Cause DNA Mutations [According to Amir
Raz](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/could-certain-frequencies/),
assistant professor of clinical neuroscience at Columbia University,
exposure to ionizing radiation, such as the one in EMPs, can cause DNA
damage and mutations. He also stated that non-ionizing energy from cell
phone towers, power lines, and wireless devices might cause structural
and functional damage to the nervous system at radio wave frequencies.
Temporary Microvascular Leaking Is Possible In [another
study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19725471) on the effects of
EMP on the brain microvascular permeability in rats, the researchers
found that EMP exposure of 200--400 pulses produced microvascular artery
leakage in the brain. This sort of microvascular artery leaking has been
linked to mild cognitive and memory issues in humans. Although they were
still visible 12 hours after exposure, the effects were relatively
transient. EMPs Can Disrupt the Blood-Brain Barrier Besides DNA damage,
mutation, and internal burns, EMPs may also disrupt the blood-brain
barrier. This barrier is what protects the tissues of your nervous
system. When you break down that barrier, you're destroying another
layer of defense for your brain. The effect? Well, according to a [2010
research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20550949), temperature
rises of merely 1°C (1.8°F) can have a harmful impact, giving easy
access to macromolecules to permeate the blood-brain barrier. High
Levels of Emp Could Impact Cognitive Functions Some studies also suggest
that high levels of EMP may severely impact the cognitive functions of
the left hemisphere of the brain, which is responsible for language and
speech. According to [this
study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19725471), it can briefly
short-circuit the [neural
circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_circuit). [Most Studies
Show That Any Effects Are Limited]{.underline} Based on the studies
reviewed so far in this article, the conclusion is that you may
experience some adverse effects during the first 12 hours of an EMP.
However, it's important to mention that [the bulk of these researches
includes relatively high levels of microwave radiation exposure during
testing -- probably much higher than what you'd get from a nuclear
detonation or a solar flare in the event of an EMP.]{.underline}

Dr Stonier\'s chapter 9, \"Pestilence and Plague: The Threat of
Epidemics\" and the remainder of the book is contrived and deceptive,
citing in his bibliography - but ignoring in his text - [documentary
evidence from nuclear test ecological recovery]{.underline} at Eniwetok
Atoll near two megaton yield tests which [contradicts his case that the
insects will inherit the Earth. He]{.underline} entirely [ignores the
plague of 1348]{.underline}-50 which [killed a third of the population
in Western Europe as an example of the human recovery potential after a
huge disaster]{.underline} (see Jack Hirshleifer, *Disaster and
Recovery: The Black Death in Western Europe,* RAND Corporation report
RM4700, 1966, online PDF linked here). Like his ability to ignore the
lack of firestorms in modern London buildings and the limited firestorm
intensity even in the wooden two-storey buildings of Hiroshima, and to
misrepresent the Hamburg firestorm in 3-5 storey medieval wooden
overcrowded buildings as illustrative of the threat to modern concrete,
steel and brick cities, Stonier misrepresents plague risks. [He delves
back selectively through the history of epidemics to find examples that
tend to support his thesis (simply ignoring all evidence to the
contrary) such as tularemia (a virulent bacterial infection transmitted
by tick bites, skin contact, inhalation and ingestion]{.underline},
which concentrating in the lymph nodes, [causing weakness and fever but
not]{.underline} usually [death]{.underline}) outbreak of 1941 in
Rostov-on-Don, Russia, where 37,000 people were infected. [This outbreak
resulted from the wartime conscription, which left the crops unharvested
in the fields, allowing field mice to proliferate, spreading tularemia
through their droppings and ticks]{.underline} on the hay and grain
stored in barns, which were used by soldiers for sleeping quarters.
Stonier then studies the second bubonic plague outbreak that began on 14
August 1907 in San Francisco, infecting 167 people of which 89 died,
over a year after the city was devastated by the great earthquake and
fire of 18 April 1906. This plague was spread by fleas living on rats
breeding in the insanitary conditions of the wrecked city, which still
lacked functioning sewage disposal systems. Stonier moves on to the more
deadly pneumonic plague which broke out in Oakland, California, 1919,
when a hunter infected by flea bites from the fur of a groundhog spread
plague, infecting 14 cases of which 13 proved fatal. Stonier then
discusses the similar mechanism for the larger-scale pneumonic plague
outbreak amongst fur-trappers in Manchouli, Manchuria, 1910-11. That
plague killed 60,000 because it was spread first in crowded underground
inns in Manchouli, and later (as cases appeared) these infected people
panicked and fled on the Chinese Eastern Railway to numerous towns
throughout the whole country. On page 131 [Stonier attempts to
glue]{.underline} [these historical plague examples to the aftermath of
nuclear warfare, by claiming that the birds and mammal predators for
insect disease vectors will be killed off by]{.underline} 1,000
roentgens of gamma [radiation exposure, whereas adult insects will
survive]{.underline} 100,000 roentgens and can reproduce at doses of up
to 5,000 roentgens. He points out that conifers like pine trees are
about as vulnerable as mammals (spruce seeds are killed by 1,000
roentgens, he states on p. 143), but in general plants can withstand
5,000 roentgens of gamma radiation, while mustard seeds can \"absorb
92,000 roentgens and still produce viable plants\" (Stonier, p. 131). On
page 132 Stonier points out that 13 out of 15 flora species were injured
or killed over five years by fallout radiation at the world\'s most
highly contaminated fallout location, Gegen Islet at the northern edge
of Rongelap Atoll, giving the island a grey rather than green colour as
seen from aircraft five years later. Gegen Islet was the downwind
fallout hotspot location 100 miles downwind of the 15 Mt *Bravo* test,
giving a 3,000 rads gamma dose within 48 hours, and thousands more at a
slower rate, later on. Moving southward in Rongelap Atoll, the radiation
doses were smaller, and the damage less. At Kabelle Island, for
instance, only 3 species of flora were killed, including the mangroves,
and at Eniwetok Islet in Rongerik Atoll (further downwind) only 2
species of flora were affected by fallout. (References: F. R. Fosberg,
\"Plants and Fall-out\", **[Nature,]{.underline}** v. 183, 1959, p.
1448, and Robert A. Conard, Brookhaven National Laboratory report
BNL-609, 1961, pp. 85-6.) Stonier believed that radiation kills off most
birds and animals that normally keep eat insects, thus [allowing plagues
of]{.underline} relatively [radiation-resistant insects to
breed]{.underline} on the surviving vegetation [and spread diseases to
surviving humans]{.underline}: \"The result: insect plagues. Associated
with the spread of insects would be the spread of certain insect-borne
diseases.\" This was based on ecological studies by G. M. Woodwell at
Brookhaven National Laboratory, who exposed an oak and pine forest on
Long Island, New York, to gamma radiation from cesium-137 (G. M.
Woodwell, \"Effects of Ionizing Radiation on Terrestrial Ecosystems\",
*Science*, v. 138, 1962, pp. 572-7). Stonier observes on p. 135 that
\"where the oaks received 5 roentgens per day, the defoliation by
insects was about five times as great as that observed in control
areas.\" This cesium-137 gamma exposure has no relevance to the overall
effects of radioactive fallout, since it ignores the effects of beta
radiation (which is easily stopped by tree bark) upon insects.

1.1.3 Engineered pandemics For most of human history, natural pandemics
have posed the greatest risk of mass global fatalities[.]{.underline}37
However, there are some reasons to believe that **[natural pandemics are
very unlikely to cause human extinction]{.underline}**. Analysis of the
International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list database
has shown that [of the 833 recorded]{.underline} plant and animal
[species extinctions]{.underline} known to have occurred [since 1500,
less than 4% (31 species) were ascribed to infectious
disease]{.underline}.38 [None of the mammals and amphibians on this list
were globally dispersed, and other factors aside from infectious disease
also contributed to their extinction. It therefore seems that our own
species, which is very **numerous**, globally **dispersed**, and capable
of a **rational response** to problems, **is very unlikely to be killed
off by a natural pandemic**]{.underline}. One underlying explanation for
this is that [highly lethal pathogens can kill their hosts before they
have a chance to spread, so **there is a selective pressure for
pathogens not to be highly lethal**. Therefore, pathogens are likely to
co-evolve with their hosts rather than kill all possible
hosts]{.underline}.39

Emergency systems Nuclear plants obviously require electricity to
operate their cooling pumps, not to mention their control systems. That
power is normally tapped off of the electricity that the reactor
generates. [If the plant is offline]{.underline}, the [power is provided
by]{.underline} the electrical grid. [But what happens when the grid
itself goes down]{.underline}? The short answer is that large **[on-site
diesel generators]{.underline}** automatically activate to provide
electricity. And if those should fail, **[portable diesel
generators]{.underline}**, which are also on-site, can be connected.
Recent [standardization has also ensured that generators can be swapped
between plants]{.underline} without the need to retrofit connectors.
[There are also a couple of additional emergency systems that can be
used specifically to cool the reactor]{.underline}. These include the
[turbine-driven-auxiliary-feedwater pump]{.underline}, which uses steam
generated by the reactor to power a cooling turbine. The pump requires
an operator, but **[it runs completely without
electricity]{.underline}**. This system, however, is meant only for
emergency cooling of the reactor during those critical first few days
when the fuel rod assemblies are being brought down in temperature, not
for long-term cooling. And finally, in the [worst case]{.underline},
most [plants have]{.underline} a [method of bringing in
river]{.underline} or ocean [water to flood the reactor]{.underline}.
This typically damages the cooling system, but again, [it helps to cool
and cover the reactor core should all else fail]{.underline}. Unlike in
other countries, permission from the federal government is not required
to flood the reactor. Worst-case power-loss scenario With backup systems
to the backup systems, it would seem that there's nothing to worry
about, right? Under all but the direst of circumstances, I think that
assessment is correct. However, one could imagine a scenario in which
the grid was lost and the diesel generators ran out of fuel. Speaking of
fuel, how much is actually stored onsite? It depends on the plant, but
at the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, for example, there is enough fuel to run
the emergency diesel generators for at least 42 days. I say at least
because it would depend on exactly what was being powered. Once the
reactor was cooled down, a much smaller system, known as the Residual
Heat Removal System, would be all that was required to keep the fuel
assemblies cool, both in the reactor and the spent fuel rods pool. The
generators and onsite fuel supply could power that smaller cooling
system for significantly longer than if they were powering the larger
reactor cooling system. Even if we assumed a worst case of 42 days, it's
hard to imagine a scenario in which that would not be enough time to
bring in additional fuel either by land, water, or air. Nonetheless,
let's push the question a little further. What would happen in the
unlikely event that the diesel fuel was exhausted? Even with the reactor
having been successfully cooled, the biggest risk would continue to be
overheating of the fuel rod assemblies, both in the reactor and the
spent fuel rods pool. Without circulation, the heat from the fuel rod
assemblies could boil the surrounding water, resulting in steam. In
turn, the water levels would drop, ultimately exposing the fuel rods to
air. Once exposed to air, their temperatures would rise but not to the
levels that would melt the zirconium cladding. Thankfully, that means
that **[meltdown would not occur]{.underline}**. The steam might well
carry radioactive contaminants into the air, but [there would be no
release of hydrogen and, thus, no subsequent explosions. The situation
would certainly be dangerous to surrounding communities, but it wouldn't
be the nuclear Armageddon that many people worry about.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--AT: Ozone

low dose radiation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki Life Span Study (LSS)!"
http://glasstone.blogspot.com/2009/04/radiation-effects-research-foundation.html
4/29/09)

One of several errors in the 1977 3rd edition of the U.S. Department of
Defense book ***[The Effects of Nuclear Weapons]{.underline}*** is
[the]{.underline} false [claim]{.underline} on page 78 that [air
bursts]{.underline} like those over Hiroshima and Nagasaki [damage the
ozone]{.underline} (O~3~) [layer]{.underline} which exists at altitudes
of 15-30 km: \'\... nuclear explosions are accompanied by the formation
\[in the blast wave at high overpressures\] of oxides of nitrogen
\[causing the red-brown colour to the rising fireball before condensing
water vapor turns it white\]. An air burst, for example, is estimated to
produce about 10^32^ molecules of nitrogen oxides per megaton of TNT
equivalent \... hence, the nitrogen oxides from such explosions would be
expected to enhance mechanisms which tend to decrease the ozone
concentration.\' [This is false because:]{.underline} (1) [the initial
gamma radiation from both surface and air bursts produce a large ozone
layer around the early fireball, shielding the early thermal radiation
from the fireball after nuclear explosions]{.underline}, and this
**[ozone production]{.underline}** is not mentioned in the book. [The
mechanism for the production of ozone]{.underline} naturally [is the
absorption by oxygen molecules]{.underline} (O~2~) of short-wavelength
ultraviolet light[, bordering the soft X-ray spectrum]{.underline}. In
addition to ozone formation by gamma radiation, [nuclear weapons
release]{.underline} typically 70-[80% of their energy as such soft
X-rays]{.underline} in a blackbody distribution (Glasstone and Dolan,
pp. 23-5) which is soon degraded by air scatter into ultraviolet
radiation which forms ozone. The reaction is: 3O~2~ + energy -\> 2O~3~.
The heat released by the natural ozone-forming process is the reason for
the increase in the temperature of the stratosphere with [altitude. The
natural chemical reaction **produces about 4,500 tons of ozone per
second** in the stratosphere,]{.underline} which maintains equilibrium
by being broken down at a similar rate by other natural chemical
reactions. (2) the nitrogen oxides, largely nitrogen dioxide, in the
fireball soon reacts with moisture in the white mushroom cloud to
produce [nitric acid,]{.underline} which [is]{.underline} later
[precipitated in rainfall]{.underline} along with naturally produced
nitric acid from lightning storms, [and has no effect on the ozone
layer]{.underline}. A lightning storm is qualitatively like a nuclear
explosion in that it produces **[both]{.underline}** ozone (from the
electrical discharge air ionization) and nitrogen oxides (from the shock
waves formed around the extremely hot lightning bolts, which are later
heard as thunder). Nitric acid (HNO~3~) production from the mixing with
nitrogen dioxide and water vapour in the fireball is described by the
reaction: 3NO~2~ + H~2~O -\> 2HNO~3~ + NO then the nitrogen oxide, NO,
itself gets oxidized into nitric acid by the reaction: 4NO + 3O~2~ +
2H~2~O -\> 4HNO~3~ [It was a bigger hoax than Piltdown Man to suggest
that nitrogen oxides from nuclear bomb tests could break down ozone;
they instead get oxidised into nitric acid by atmospheric moisture and
oxygen *before they can reach the ozone layer***.**]{.underline} For a
published discussion of the nitric acid production in the air around the
fireball from an atmospheric nuclear explosion, see Murray Scheibe, *The
Increased Attachment Due to Ionization-Induced Smog in EMP
Environments,* Mission Research Corporation, California, MRC-R-532,
DNA5077F, ADA087850, 1979: \'The increased electron attachment due to
HNO~3~ production in the EMP source region is investigated. The HNO~3~
produced is found to be roughly linear with the total ionization up to
an ionization value of about 2 x 10 to the 16th power ion pairs. Above
this, the HNO~3~ production is less than linear.\' P. Goldsmith, A. F.
Tuck, J. S. Foot, E. L. Simmons and R. L. Newson, reported in their
paper, \'Nitrogen oxides, nuclear weapon testing, Concorde and
stratospheric ozone\' published in **[Nature,]{.underline}** vol. 244
(1973), issue 5418, pp. 545-551: \'Although amounts of nitrogen oxides
equivalent to the output from many concordes were released into the
atmosphere when nuclear testing was at its peak, the amount of ozone in
the atmosphere was not affected.\' In total, the U.S.A, U.S.S.R., U.K.,
France and China detonated 545.4 megatons in the atmosphere, the peak
rate of testing occurring in 1962, see page 295 of Merril Eisenbud and
Thomas F. Gesell, *Environmental Radioactivity,* Academic Press, 4th
ed., 1997 (the ten biggest atmospheric tests are listed on an earlier
post, here). **[*Finally, for high altitude explosions, there is no high
pressure air blast wave, thus no production of nitrogen oxides
whatsoever, but the gamma radiation striking the atmosphere still
produces ozone!*]{.underline}** Therefore, [**such** **explosions have
the exact opposite effect on the ozone layer to the claims being
made**]{.underline}. This has some importance to the issue of holes in
the ozone layer by CFCs, and the way to repair such damage.

### 2NC\-\--AT: Growth 

#### Economic decline [doesn't]{.underline} cause war\-\--even if it does, we [solve]{.underline} escalation 

#### Turn\-\--it [increases]{.underline} cooperation

Politics and International Affairs at Princeton; Krzysztof J. Pelc is an
Associate Professor of Political Science at McGill University,
"Cooperation in Hard Times: Self-restraint of Trade Protection," Journal
of Conflict Resolution, 61(2): 398-429

[Conclusion Political economy theory would lead us to expect rising
trade protection during hard times]{.underline}. [Yet **empirical
evidence**]{.underline} on this count [has been mixed]{.underline}. Some
studies find a correlation between poor macroeconomic conditions and
protection, but the worst recession since the Great Depression has
generated surprisingly moderate levels of protection. We explain this
apparent contradiction. [Our statistical findings show that under
conditions of pervasive economic crisis]{.underline} at the
international level, [states exercise more **restraint**]{.underline}
than they would when facing crisis alone. [These results throw light on
behavior not only during the crisis, but throughout the WTO
period]{.underline}, from 1995 to the present. One concern may be that
the restraint we observe during widespread crises is actually the result
of a decrease in aggregate demand and that domestic pressure for import
relief is lessened by the decline of world trade. [By **controlling**
for **product-level imports**, we show that the restraint on remedy use
is not a byproduct of declining imports]{.underline}. [We]{.underline}
**[also]{.underline}** [take into account the ability of]{.underline}
some [countries to **manipulate their currency** and demonstrate that
the relationship between crisis and trade protection **holds**
independent of exchange rate policies]{.underline}. Government
[decisions to impose costs on their trade partners by taking advantage
of their legal right to use flexibility measures]{.underline} are driven
not only by the domestic situation but also by circumstances abroad.
This [can give rise to an individual **incentive for strategic
self-restraint** toward trade partners in similar economic
trouble]{.underline}. Under conditions of widespread crisis, [government
leaders **fear** the **repercussions** that their own use of trade
protection may have on the behavior of trade partners at a time when
they cannot afford the economic cost of a trade war]{.underline}.
[Institutions provide **monitoring** and a venue for **leader
interaction** that **facilitates coordination** among
states]{.underline}. Here the key function is [to reinforce expectations
that any move to protect industries will trigger similar moves in other
countries]{.underline}. Such coordination often draws on shared
historical analogies, such as the Smoot--Hawley lesson, which form a
focal point to shape beliefs about appropriate state behavior. Much of
the literature has focused on the more visible action of legal
enforcement through dispute settlement, but this only captures part of
the story. Our research suggests that [tools of informal governance such
as leader pledges, guidance from the Director General, trade policy
reviews, and plenary meetings **play a real role** within the trade
regime]{.underline}. In the absence of sufficiently stringent rules over
flexibility measures, compliance alone is insufficient during a global
economic crisis. [These **circumstances** trigger **informal
mechanisms** that complement legal rules to **support
cooperation**]{.underline}. [During widespread crisis, legal enforcement
would be inadequate, and informal governance helps to bolster the
system]{.underline}. Informal coordination is by nature difficult to
observe, and we are unable to directly measure this process. Instead, we
examine the variation in responses across crises of varying severity,
within the context of the same formal setting of the WTO. Yet by
focusing on discretionary tools of protection---trade remedies and
tariff hikes within the bound rate---we can offer conclusions about how
systemic crises shape country restraint independent of formal
institutional constraints. Insofar as [institutions are
generating]{.underline} such [restraint]{.underline}, we offer that it
is [by facilitating informal coordination]{.underline}, since all these
instruments of trade protection fall within the letter of the law.
Future research should explore trade policy at the micro level to
identify which pathway is the most important for coordination. Research
at a more macro-historical scope could compare how countries respond to
crises under fundamentally different institutional contexts. In sum, the
determinants of protection include economic downturns not only at home
but also abroad. [Rather than reinforcing pressure for protection,
pervasive crisis in the global economy is shown to generate
countervailing pressure for restraint in response to domestic
crisis]{.underline}. In some cases, **[hard times bring more, not less,
international cooperation]{.underline}**.

\'Water: Broadly the same principles apply as with food. [Gamma rays
have no effect upon water]{.underline}, but certainly in the case of
hydrogen bomb explosions the deposition of contaminated dust on
catchment areas and open reservoirs would constitute a serious hazard. A
special version of the contamination meter has been designed for testing
water, and water undertakings are well aware of the problems which face
them from this type of hazard should it arise. It is worth noting that
an [ordinary domestic water softener]{.underline} in good condition
[completely removes the]{.underline} dangerous [elements]{.underline}
(strontium and barium) from contaminated water \[since [fallout from
surface bursts]{.underline} on silicate based soil is insoluble glassy
spheroids, it [doesn\'t dissolve in water and the soluble activity
hazards are trivial]{.underline} unless the detonation occurs on coral,
limestone or chalk\].

Thirty Year Study of the Survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, was
published in 1977. It [concludes that the incidence of abnormalities is
no higher among children]{.underline} later conceived by parents who
were [exposed to radiation]{.underline} during the attacks on Hiroshima
and Nagasaki [than is the incidence of abnormalities among]{.underline}
Japanese [children born to un-exposed parents.]{.underline} This is not

[Nuclear tests on oil and gas storage tanks in the Nevada showed that
even at the highest peak overpressures and thermal radiation fluences
tested, they did not ignite or explode even where they were blasted off
their stands,]{.underline} [dented by impacts, or otherwise
damaged]{.underline}. [The metal containers easily protected the
contents from the brief flash of thermal radiation, while the blast wave
arriving some time later later failed to cause ignition]{.underline}.
Individual leaves cast shadows on wooden poles at Hiroshima, proving
that even very thin materials stopped an intense thermal radiation
flash. [No mention let alone analysis of any of this solid nuclear
weapons effects evidence is done by any of the \"nuclear winter\" doom
mongers, who falsely assume that somehow everything will ignite and then
undergo sustained burning like a dry newspaper]{.underline} in a direct

[\'The density of initial ignitions in the main fire zone]{.underline},
for UK houses, [is]{.underline} likely to be very roughly [one house in
thirty]{.underline}, with a fire-spread factor of about 2 \[i.e., each
initial ignition will on average ignite one other building by thermal
radiation, wind blown convection flames, and hot burning firebrands\].
About one house in fifteen is expected to become burnt out. This
situation would not constitute a \"firestorm\" or \"mass fire\", and the
number of fire casualties should be small.\' [Firestorms have always
required at least 50% of buildings to be ignited]{.underline}. [A 71
pages long report by]{.underline} Robert M. Rodden, Floyd I. John, and
Richard Laurino, *Exploratory Analysis of Fire Storms,* [Stanford
Research Institute]{.underline}, California, report AD616638, May 1965,
[identified]{.underline} the following [parameters required by all
firestorms:]{.underline} (1) [More than 8 pounds of fuel per square
foot]{.underline} (40 kg per square metre) of ground area. Hence
firestorms occurred in wooden buildings, like Hiroshima or the medieval
part of Hamburg. The combustible fuel load in London is just 24 kg/m^2^,
whereas in the firestorm area of Hamburg in 1943 it was 156 kg/m^2^. The
real reason for all the historical fire conflagrations was only exposed
in 1989 by the analysis of L. E. Frost and E.L. Jones, 'The Fire Gap and
the Greater Durability of Nineteenth-Century Cities' (*Planning
Perspectives,* vol. 4, pp. 333-47). Each medieval city was built cheaply
from inflammable 'tinderbox' wooden houses, using trees from the
surrounding countryside*.* By 1800, Britain had cut down most of its
forests to build wood houses and to burn for heating, so the price of
wood rapidly increased (due to the expense of transporting trees long
distances), until it finally exceeded the originally higher price of
brick and stone; so from then on all new buildings were built of brick
when wooden ones decayed. This rapidly reduced the fire risk. Also, in
1932, British Standard 476 was issued, which specified the fire
resistance of building materials. In addition, new cities were built
with wider streets and rubbish disposal to prevent tinder accumulation
in alleys, which created more effective fire breaks. (2) [More than 50%
of structures ignited initially.]{.underline} (3) Initial [surface
winds]{.underline} of [less than 8 miles per hour.]{.underline} (4)
[Initial ignition area exceeding 0.5 square mile. The fuel loading per
unit ground area is equal to fuel loading per unit area of a building,
multiplied by the builtupness]{.underline} fraction of the area. E.g.,
Hamburg had a 45% builtupness (45% of the ground area was actually
covered by buildings), and the buildings were multistorey medieval
wooden constructions containing 70 pounds of fuel per square foot.
Hence, in Hamburg the fuel loading of ground area was 0.45\*70 = 32
pounds per square foot, which was enough for a firestorm. By contrast,
[modern cities have a builtupness of]{.underline} only
[10]{.underline}-25[%]{.underline} in most residential areas and 40% in
commercial and downtown areas. Modern wooden American houses have a fuel
loading of 20 pounds per square foot of building area with a builtupness
below 25%, so the fuel loading per square foot of ground is below
20\*0.25 = 5 pounds per square foot, and would not produce a firestorm.
[Brick and concrete buildings contain on the average about 3.5 pounds
per square foot of floor area,]{.underline} so [they can\'t produce
firestorms either**, even if they are all ignited.**]{.underline}

Stonier cites in his bibliography, but chooses to ignore completely in
his text (without explanation) the rapid recovery and lack of insect
plagues [on Bogombogo Island]{.underline} (codenamed \"Belle Island\" by
America) at the North-West of Eniwetok Atoll in the North Pacific, which
[was selected for detailed ecological studies following two high yield
nuclear weapons tests]{.underline}: Dr Ralph F. Palumbo,
**[Radioactivity and Recovery of the Land Plants at Eniwetok Atoll,
1954-1957,]{.underline}** University of Washington report UWFL-66, July
1960 (PDF linked here), see the recovery photos linked here.
Bogombogo/Belle Island was 2.55 statute miles (4.10 km) from the centre
of Elugelab Island, ground zero of the 10.4 megatons
**[IVY-MIKE]{.underline}** thermonuclear weapon test of November 1,
1952, and the 1.69 megatons 80% fission **[CASTLE-NECTAR]{.underline}**
test was detonated at the same spot on a barge over the
**[IVY-MIKE]{.underline}** crater on May 14, 1954. [It received heavy
blast and thermal damage, water wave flooding, and fallout radiation
including extensive beta and gamma irradiation of plants]{.underline}
(gamma of over 850 R/hr at 2 hours after *IVY-MIKE* according to page 34
of of report WT-615, which - from the mean fallout arrival time and peak
dose rate time measured under the cloud - suggests an infinite dose of
over 8,000 R, and then another 400 R to 6 months after
**[CASTLE-NECTAR]{.underline}** and beta doses near contaminated
surfaces are about ten times larger, see Stonier p. 143). Dr Palumbo
states in his article \"Recovery of the Land Plants at Eniwetok Atoll
Following a Nuclear Detonation\" (**[Radiation Botany,]{.underline}**
vol. 1, 1962, pp. 182-9): \"The **[Mike]{.underline}** detonation of
1952 had removed most of the plants and top soil from Belle Island,
resulting in the depletion of some of the elements essential for plant
growth. In spite of these deficiencies regrowth of the plants at Belle
Island was rapid. \... A photograph of Belle Island taken \[on May 22,
1954\] eight days following the **[Nectar]{.underline}** detonation
shows the extent of the damage sustained by the plants. From the air the
island looked brown and desolate. On closer inspection it was found that
most of the plants had been scorched by the heat wave and many of them
had been blown over or broken by the blast. \... [Recovery of the plants
was rapid.]{.underline} \... On the eighth day green buds, 1-3 mm in
length, were observed on the stems of **[Scaevola]{.underline}** and
**[Messerschmidia]{.underline}** plants. On the thirty-fifth day the
shoot leaves were 7-15 cm long, covering much of the old stems and
giving the plants a green and healthy appearance. By this time [many of
the other plants had formed new leaves and three species]{.underline}
(**[Portulaca, Triumfetta,]{.underline}** and
**[Messerschmidia]{.underline}**) **[had produced new flowers and
fruits.]{.underline}** The island now had lost its scorched appearance;
from the air it looked green rather than brown as it had one month
earlier. \"In August, [three months after the detonation, the plants
were growing well and some species]{.underline}, such as
**[Boerhaavia,]{.underline}** [had produced new flowers. The leaves of
most of the species had grown to maximum size, and the branches had
grown almost to the pre-**Nectar** dimensions.\"]{.underline}

[The percentage of deaths due to delayed effects has always been dwarfed
by the natural cancer and natural genetic defect rates]{.underline}, see
for instance Radiation Research, volume 146, 1996, pp. 1-27. [In a
controlled sample of 36,500]{.underline} survivors, 89 people got
leukemia over a 40 year period, above the natural leukemia number of 176
in the unexposed control group, due to the thermal unstability of DNA
which is naturally broken due to random molecular impacts from the
Brownian motion of water molecules at body temperature, 37 °C. There
were 4,687 other, \"solid\", tumour cancer deaths, which was 339 above
the unexposed matched control group. Hence in the 36,500
[Hiroshima]{.underline} [survivors]{.underline} over 40 years there were
4,863 cancers of all kinds, which is 428 more than the unexposed control
group. Hence, [12.2% naturally died from cancer over 40 years who
weren't exposed to radiation, while for the irradiated bomb survivors
the figure was 13.3%. No increase whatsoever in genetic
malformations]{.underline} could be detected: any effect was so low it
was lost in the statistical noise of natural genetic defects - the
effect of body temperature on DNA again - for the sample size. [Nature
is a way]{.underline}, way, way [bigger problem than radiation from
nuclear bombs.]{.underline}

[II. The United States of America is irredeemable and unreformable, a
Pretend Society]{.underline}. [The USA]{.underline} as a nation state,
as a recent culture, [is irredeemable, unreformable, an
anti-democratic]{.underline}, vertical, [over-sized imperial
unmanageable monster]{.underline}, sustained by the obedience and
cooperation, even if reluctant, of the vast majority of its
non-autonomous population. [Virtually all of us are complicit in this
**imperial plunder**]{.underline} even as many of us are increasingly
repulsed by it and speak out against it. Lofty
**[rhetoric]{.underline}** [has conditioned us to believe
in]{.underline} our [national exceptionalism,]{.underline} despite it
being dramatically at odds with the empirically revealed pattern of our
plundering cultural behavior totally dependent upon outsourcing the pain
and suffering elsewhere. [We cling to living a life based on the
**social myth** of]{.underline} US [America being committed to justice
for all]{.underline}, even as we increasingly know this has always
served as a cover for the social secret that the US is committed to
prosperity for a minority thru expansion at ANY cost. [Our Eurocentric
origins have been built on]{.underline} an extraordinary and forceful
but [rationalized dispossession of **hundreds of Indigenous
nations**]{.underline} [(a genocide) assuring acquisition of free land,
murdering millions with total impunity]{.underline}. [This still
unaddressed crime against humanity assured that our eyes themselves are
the wool]{.underline}. Our addiction to the comfort and convenience
brought to us by centuries of forceful theft of land, labor, and
resources is very difficult to break, as with any addiction. However,
**[our survival]{.underline}**, and healing, [requires a commitment to
recovery of our humanity]{.underline}, [ceasing our obedience to the
national state]{.underline}. This is the (r)evolution begging us.
Original wool is in our eyes: Eurocentric values were established with
the invasion by Columbus: Cruelty never before seen, nor heard of, nor
read of -- Bartolome de las Casas describing the behavior of the
Spaniards inflicted on the Indigenous of the West Indies in the 1500s.
In fact the Indigenous had no vocabulary words to describe the behavior
inflicted on them (A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies,
1552). [Eurocentric racism (]{.underline}hatred driven by fear)
[and]{.underline} arrogant religious [ethnocentrism]{.underline}
(self-righteous superiority) [have never been]{.underline} honestly
[addressed]{.underline} or overcome. Thus, **[our foundational
values]{.underline}** and behaviors[, if not]{.underline} **[radically
transformed]{.underline}** from arrogance to caring[, will prove fatal
to our]{.underline} modern [species]{.underline}. Wool has remained
uncleansed from our eyes: I personally discovered the continued vigorous
U.S. application of the "Columbus Enterprise" in Viet Nam, discovering
that Viet Nam was no aberration after learning of more than 500 previous
US military interventions beginning in the late 1790s. Our business is
killing, and business is good was a slogan painted on the front of a 9th
Infantry Division helicopter in Viet Nam's Mekong Delta in 1969. We, not
the Indigenous, were and remain the savages. The US has been built on
three genocides: violent and arrogant dispossession of hundreds of
Indigenous nations in North America (Genocide #1), and in Africa
(Genocide #2), stealing land and labor, respectively, with total
impunity, murdering and maiming millions, amounting to genocide. [It is
morally]{.underline} unsustainable, now [ecologically]{.underline},
politically, [economically]{.underline}, and socially
[unsustainable]{.underline} as well. [Further, in the 20th Century, the
Republic of the US intervened several hundred times in well over a
hundred nations stealing resources and labor, while imposing US-friendly
markets, killing millions, impoverishing perhaps billions (Genocide #3).
Since 1798, the US military forces have militarily intervened over 560
times in dozens of nations, nearly 400 of which have occurred since
World War II]{.underline}. And [since WWII, the US has bombed **28
countries**,]{.underline} while covertly intervening thousands of times
in the majority of nations on the earth. It is not helpful to continue
believing in the social myth that the USA is a society committed to
justice for all , in fact a convenient mask (since our origins) of our
social secret being a society committed to prosperity for a few through
expansion at ANY cost. (See William Appleman Williams). Always
possessing oligarchic tendencies, it is now an outright corrupt
corporatocracy owned lock stock and barrel by big money made obscenely
rich from war making with our consent, even if reluctant. The Cold War
and its nuclear and conventional arms race with the exaggerated "red
menace", was an insidious cover for a war preserving the Haves from the
Have-Nots, in effect, ironically preserving a western, consumptive way
of life that itself is killing us. Pretty amazing[! Our way of life has
produced so much carbon in the water, soil, and atmosphere, that it may
in the end be equivalent to having caused nuclear winter]{.underline}.
The war OF wholesale terror on retail [terror has replaced the "red
menace" as the rhetorical justification for the continued imperial
plunder of the earth and the riches it brings to the
military-industrial-intelligence-congressional-executive-information
complex]{.underline}. Our [cooperation with]{.underline} and addiction
to the [American Way Of Life provides]{.underline} the [political energy
that guarantees]{.underline} continuation of U.S. polices of **[imperial
plunder]{.underline}**. III. The American Way Of Life (AWOL), and [the
Western Way of Life]{.underline} in general, **[is the most dangerous
force that exists on the earth]{.underline}**. [Our]{.underline}
insatiable [consumption patterns on a finite earth,]{.underline} enabled
by but a one-century blip in burning energy efficient liquid fossil
fuels, have made virtually all of us addicted to our way of life as we
have been conditioned to be in denial about the egregious consequences
outsourced outside our view or feeling fields. Of course, this trend
began 2 centuries earlier with the advent of the industrial revolution.
With 4.6% of the world's population, [we consume]{.underline} anywhere
from 25% to [nearly half the world's resources]{.underline}. This kind
of theft can only occur by force or its threat, justifying it with noble
sounding rhetoric, over and over and over. Our insatiable individual and
collective human demands for energy inputs originating from outside our
bioregions, furnish the political-economic profit motives for the energy
extractors, which in turn own the political process obsessed with
preserving "national (in)security", e.g., maintaining a very class-based
life of affluence and comfort for a minority of the world's people.
This, in turn, requires a huge military to assure control of resources
for our use, protecting corporate plunder, and to eliminate perceived
threats from competing political agendas. The U.S. War department's
policy of "full spectrum dominance" is intended to control the world's
seas, airspaces, land bases, outer spaces, our "inner" mental spaces,
and cyberspaces. Resources everywhere are constantly needed to supply
our delusional modern life demands on a finite planet as the system
seeks to dumb us down ever more. Thus, we are terribly complicit in the
current severe dilemmas coming to a head due to (1) climate instability
largely caused by mindless human activities; (2) from our dependence
upon national currencies; and (3) dependence upon rapidly depleting
finite resources. We have become addicts in a classical sense. Recovery
requires a deep psychological, spiritual, and physical commitment to
break our addiction to materialism, as we embark on a radical healing
journey, individually and collectively, where less and local becomes a
mantra, as does sharing and caring, I call it the Neolithic or
Indigenous model. Sharing and caring replace individualism and
competition. Therefore, A Radical Prescription Understanding these facts
requires a radical paradigmatic shift in our thinking and behavior,
equivalent to an evolutionary shift in our epistemology where our
knowledge/thinking framework shifts: arrogant separateness from and
domination over nature (ending a post-Ice Age 10,000 year cycle of
thought structure among moderns) morphs to integration with nature,
i.e., an eco-consciousness felt deeply in the viscera, more powerful
than a cognitive idea. Thus, we re-discover ancient, archetypal
Indigenous thought patterns. It requires creative disobedience to and
strategic noncooperation with the prevailing political economy, while
re-constructing locally reliant communities patterned on instructive
models of historic Indigenous and Neolithic villages.

Abstract: [The heat generated inside our planet is predominantly of
radionic]{.underline} (nuclear) [origin]{.underline}. Hence, [Earth
in]{.underline}¶ [its entirety can be considered a slow nuclear reactor
with its solid "inner core" providing a major contribution to the total
energy output]{.underline}. Since **[radionic heat is generated in the
entire volume and cooling can only occur at the surface, the highest
temperature inside Earth occurs at the center of the inner
core]{.underline}**. **[Overheating the center of the inner core reactor
due to the so-called greenhouse effect on the surface of Earth may cause
a meltdown condition]{.underline}**,¶ an enrichment of nuclear fuel and
a gigantic atomic explosion.¶ Summary: Consequences of global warming
are far more serious than previously imagined. [The REAL danger for our
entire civilization comes not from slow climate changes]{.underline},
**[but from overheating of the planetary interior.]{.underline}**
**[Life on Earth is possible only because of the efficient cooling of
the planetary interior]{.underline}** - [a process that is
limited]{.underline}¶ [primarily by the atmosphere]{.underline}. This
**[cooling is responsible for a thermal balance between the heat from
the core reactor]{.underline}**, [the heat from the Sun and the
radiation of heat into space, so that the average temperature on
Earth's]{.underline}¶ [surface is about 13 degrees
Celsius]{.underline}.¶ [This article examines the possibility of
overheating and the "meltdown" of the solid planetary core due to
the]{.underline}¶ [atmospheric pollution trapping progressively more
solar heat]{.underline} (the so-called greenhouse effect) [and reducing
the]{.underline}¶ [cooling rate of the planetary interior.]{.underline}¶
**[The most serious consequence of such a "meltdown" could be
centrifugal segregation of unstable isotopes in]{.underline}**¶ **[the
molten part of the spinning planetary core]{.underline}**. **[Such
segregation can "enrich" the nuclear fuel in the core to
the]{.underline}**¶ **[point of creating conditions for a chain reaction
and a gigantic atomic explosion.]{.underline}** Will Earth become
another¶ "asteroid belt" in the Solar system?¶ It is common knowledge
(experiencing seasons) that solar heat is the dominant factor that
determines temperatures on the surface of Earth. Under the polar ice
however, the contribution of solar heat is minimal and this¶ is where
the increasing contribution of the heat from the planetary interior can
be seen best. Rising polar ocean¶ temperatures and melting polar ice
caps should therefore be the first symptoms of overheating of the inner
core¶ reactor.¶ While politicians and businessmen debate the need for
reducing greenhouse emissions and take pride to evade¶ accepting any
responsibility, the process of overheating the inner core reactor has
already begun - polar oceans¶ have become warmer and polar caps have
begun to melt. Do we have enough imagination, intelligence and¶
integrity to comprehend the danger before the situation becomes
irreversible? There will be NO SECOND¶ CHANCE\...

Freedom of Information Act) the successor, Harold L. Brode\'s 1992
version of EM-1, which was subsequently slowly declassified with some
important deletions (it is much longer than Dolan\'s version, with each
chapter a separate lengthy document). Arkin writes about receiving the
updated version in the July 1997 issue of the **[Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists]{.underline}**, leering at the depth of research and totally
ignoring the civil defense implications of accurate effects data for
survival and damage mitigation during an enemy attack. The Natural
Resources Defense Council apparently has decided to keep the actual
details of the declassified data from the latest version under wraps
(maybe it doesn\'t fit their Cold War era political agenda, whereby we
will be safe when **[we]{.underline}** disarm). At the same time that it
was being declassified, the people of the Defense Special Weapons Agency
who were declassifying it decided to summarize the declassified material
(which is not everything) into a single brief summary volume. This was
edited in 1996 by John A. Northrop (who as Deputy Director of the U. S.
Defense Nuclear Agency in 1972, wrote the notice of promulgation on page
iii of the 1972 edition of *Capabilities of Nuclear Weapons*). Northrop
headed S-cubed research into nuclear terrorism effects in the 1970s and
1980s, e.g. J. A. Northrop, **[The role of civil preparedness in nuclear
terrorism mitigation planning]{.underline}**, Systems, Science and
Software, Washington Research Center, report SSS-R-80-4185, ADA081560
(1979): "An assessment of the objectives and capabilities of terrorist
groups leads to the conclusion that although an explosion of a small
nuclear bomb in a city is improbable, planning for an adequate emergency
response is necessary. At the Federal level current planning places
primary emphasis on management of terrorist events themselves, rather
than on subsequent mitigation. The responsible agencies that will be
involved must develop working relationships which will allow a rapid and
coherent response to the massive damage and casualties that would
result. Some state planning has been made, but local authority planning
is very limited. These plans, and their integration at all levels of
government, would be greatly enhanced by the drifting of models which
could be adapted to individual state and local requirements. Preliminary
assessments of effects of low-yield nuclear explosions in cities show
significant changes, produced by massive building structures, to
conventional data. Such data when further developed will provide
important guidance to urban nuclear emergency planners. A new
methodology is proposed for modeling the economic impact of terrorist
attacks tailored to the nationwide incapacitation of unique industrial
processes." See also J. A. Northrop, B. E. Freeman, and R. E. Duff,
*Program to Develop and Codify Urban Nuclear Weapon Effects. Final
Report,* S-Cubed, La Jolla, California, report SSS-R-83-6228, ADA284141
(1983): "A program is developed which, if implemented, would assess
those effects of a detonation of a terrorist nuclear weapon located in a
highly built-up urban area which are unique to the environment, and
consider possible techniques for damage limitation. It is assumed that
the weapon is of low-yield, that its hiding place can be located, and
that there is sufficient time before its detonation for the application
of mitigation techniques. A series of radiation-hydrodynamic,
hydrodynamic, radiation transport, and fallout calculations are defined
which would provide insight into the modification to classic nuclear
phenomenology produced by unique urban hiding locations, possible
mitigating of the blast and thermal threats by materials deliberately
placed around the weapon, and changes in the propagation of blast,
fallout, and thermal radiation due to surrounding buildings. It is
anticipated that, were such a theoretical study program to be
implemented, it would provide useful guidance to nuclear emergency
response planners." Northrop\'s 1996 **[Handbook of Nuclear Weapon
Effects: Calculational Tools Abstracted from DSWAs Effects Manual One
(EM-1)]{.underline}** (Defense Weapons Special Agency, Washington, D.C.)
is unclassified but of limited distribution, exactly the status of Dr
Carl F. Miller\'s report *Fallout and Radiological Countermeasures*
between 1963-9. But it contains data on the prompt high frequency EMP
source (the prompt gamma ray output of modern nuclear weapon designs)
and the spectrum of the thermal radiation as a function of burst
altitude and weapon yield which is vital for civil defense and is
omitted from the 1977 edition of Glasstone and Dolan\'s *Effects of
Nuclear Weapons*. Dolan\'s 1972 *Capabilities of Nuclear Weapons*
DNA-EM-1 in Table 5-3 and Table 5-1 as well as many graphs of data,
analyzed the radiation outputs from eight types of nuclear weapons. The
revised version by Brode analyzes 13 nuclear weapons designs, and
Northrop\'s 1996 extract handbook gives data from 4 of these designs:
type 3 (subkiloton, unboosted fission implosion), type 5 (boosted
fission implosion, 1 to a few tens of kt), type 8 (thermonuclear
secondary with single yield, a few tens of kt to 5 Mt), and type 13 (the
enhanced radiation weapon, 1-10 kt). Most fission weapons have neutron
outputs on the order of 10^23^ neutrons/kt (see for instance Table 5-1
in DNA-EM-1), the enhanced radiation weapon emits 1.77 x 10^24^
neutrons/kt, according to Northrop (1996). Northrop\'s data on prompt
gamma ray output from different nuclear weapon designs. The shocking
thing is the prompt gamma ray output (from fission and inelastic neutron
scattering reactions w ith heavy nuclei in the bomb over the first 20
nanoseconds). An enhanced radiation bomb emits a prompt gamma ray output
of 6.70 x 10^23^ MeV/kt with a mean gamma ray energy of 2.0 MeV,
according to Northrop (1996). This is about 2.6 % of the weapon yield!
Dolan\'s DNA-EM-1 chapters 5 and 7 (1978) gave a figure of 0.1-0.5 % for
the range of prompt gamma radiation outputs. Additionally, Northrop
states that the prompt gamma ray out for the type 8 thermonuclear
secondary weapon with a single yield of up to 5 Mt is 3.55 x
10^23^W~kt~^-0.29^ MeV/kt, i.e. 1.4W~kt~^-0.29^ % of yield, which is
0.18 for 1 Mt, not 0.1 % as suggested by most unclassified EMP
prediction treatments! The high prompt gamma ray output from the neutron
bomb provides a example of how the weapon design can be engineered to
produce immense outputs of EMP from a high altitude detonation. In fact,
the use of enhanced neutron radiation bombs at high altitude has always
been on the cards for ABM defenses, since one way to neutralize incoming
enemy warheads is to melt down the fissile material they contain, using
the neutron radiation from a defensive warhead. Neutron bombs have
always been of relevance to ABM defense as well as deterring massed tank
invasions. Data on the thermal radiation spectrum from nuclear weapons
in Northrop\'s limited-distribution handbook. This data is needed in the
public domain to help counter anti-civil defense propaganda about there
being no reliable data on the details of burn-causing thermal radiation.
[In fact, **extensive data exists** on the effects of nuclear weapons
from intensive scientific studies at weapon tests and also from
extensive computer simulations.]{.underline} The reason that
[critics]{.underline} of civil defense can [falsely claim nothing much
is known and get away]{.underline} with such a claim is simply that
there are restraints on the publication of data which is needed for
making a convincing case for civil defense. [It]{.underline}\'s either
secret or (when finally declassified) its \"not secret but limited in
distribution\", which amounts to [the]{.underline} same thing for the
[public]{.underline} (which just [wants to know what the facts really
are]{.underline}, so they can decide whether civil defense is justified
by the data, for themselves).

Dr. **[Butt's calculations are deliberately biased to limit the EMP
effects]{.underline}** [by first selecting a threat yield of 1-kiloton,
and then claiming effects "only" in one state]{.underline}. He argues
that terrorists or rogue states using a 1-kiloton weapon would want to
optimize the EMP field strength by detonating at the lowest possible
altitude, trading a gain in increased EMP field strength for a greatly
reduced area of effect, limited to a radius on the ground of 725
kilometers. Dr. Butt: ...the "sweet spot" for maximizing the EMP
lethality of such weapons would be a detonation altitude of about 40
kilometers\--significantly higher, or lower, and the peak fields at
ground level will decrease\....For 40 kilometers altitude, the maximum
extent of the induced EMP E1-fields is within a 725-kilometer radius.
However, [contrary to Dr. Butt, terrorists or rogue states may prefer to
trade reduced EMP field strength for a gain in area coverage, detonating
their low-yield nuclear weapon at a higher altitude]{.underline},
covering the eastern part of the United States with an EMP field. Dr.
Butt is mistaken that only the maximum region of the E1 HEMP field is
important. That is completely wrong, [as the peak electric field is not
the only important parameter for coupling to cables and
equipment]{.underline}. Extensive research has found that more
horizontal angles of incidence of the E1 HEMP are much more efficient in
coupling to lines, despite their lower field strengths. [The many errors
in Dr. Butt's understanding of HEMP phenomenology appear to result from
a lack of familiarity with some of the most basic texts on
EMP,]{.underline} such as E.F. Vance's Coupling to Shielded Cables and
MIL-STD-188-125, which provides a method of hardening and testing
ground-based C4I facilities to HEMP. [The MIL-STD-464 cited by Dr. Butt
as a source is recognized among specialists as having little value for
EMP aspects]{.underline}.

Other errors Dr. [Butt tries hard to mislead readers that]{.underline}
Department of Defense and other authoritative [Commissions disagree with
the EMP Commission]{.underline}, and do not regard a nuclear EMP attack
as a threat---[by quoting outdated or obsolete opinions. For example,
Dr. Butt quotes General Marsh dismissing the EMP threat in 1997---four
years before the establishment of the EMP Commission]{.underline}. Dr.
Butt misrepresents the views of the 2009 Strategic Posture Commission on
the EMP threat, implying that the Strategic Posture Commission disagrees
with the EMP Commission. Dr. Butt: "The 2009 Strategic Posture
Commission puts it more delicately by saying that 'the Commission is
divided over how imminent a threat this is...'" Dr. [Butt quotes the
Strategic Posture Commission out of context. The Strategic Posture
Commissioners are unanimous that EMP is a threat, disagreeing only over
whether the threat is immediate or longer term]{.underline}. In fact,
[the Strategic Posture Commission independently arrived at the same
consensus view as the EMP Commission]{.underline}---that terrorists and
rogue states could inflict a catastrophic EMP attack on the United
States. The Strategic Posture Commission urges immediate implementation
of EMP Commission recommendations to protect the national power grid.
According to America's Strategic Posture: [The Final Report of the
Congressional Commission]{.underline} on the Strategic Posture of the
United States: Lastly, [the United States should take steps to reduce
the vulnerability]{.underline} of the nation and the military to attacks
with weapons designed [to]{.underline} produce electromagnetic pulse
([EMP) effects]{.underline}. We make this recommendation although the
Commission is divided over how imminent a threat this is. Some
commissioners believe it to be a high priority threat, given foreign
activities and terrorist intentions. Others see it as a serious
potential threat, given the high level of vulnerability. Those
vulnerabilities are of many kinds. U.S. power projection forces might be
subjected to an EMP attack by an enemy calculating---mistakenly that
such an attack would not involve risks of U.S. nuclear retaliation. The
homeland might be attacked by terrorists or even by state actors with an
eye to crippling the U.S. economy and American society. From a technical
perspective, it is possible that such attacks could have catastrophic
consequences... [The EMP Commission has recommended numerous measures
that would mitigate the damage]{.underline}. The Stimulus Bill of
February 9, 2009, allocates \$11 billion to DOE for "smart grid
activities, including to modernize the electric grid." Unless such
improvements in the electric grid are focused in part on reducing EMP
vulnerabilities, vulnerability might well increase.32 Dr. Butt
misrepresents the official position of the Department of Defense on the
EMP threat. [The Secretary of Defense and his representatives have
notified the Congress by letter and in hearings that the department
concurs with the EMP Commission's threat assessment]{.underline}, and
will implement the commission's recommendations. A new directorate has
been created within the Office of the Secretary of Defense dedicated to
EMP protection. Military training events and exercises were held in 2010
featuring EMP scenarios. Under the FY2009 National Defense Authorization
Act, the Defense Department is required to report to Congress until 2015
on progress toward implementing the EMP Commission recommendations. Dr.
Butt asserts the following: "Although the EMP Commissioners have offered
a Chinese-language PowerPoint presentation outlining the effects of EMP
devices as evidence that China has an interest in such weapons, this
presentation is actually of Taiwanese origin... and it is not pertinent
to any official Chinese military document." No member or staff of the
EMP Commission has ever misrepresented the Taiwanese PowerPoint on EMP
as originating from the People's Republic of China. However, Taiwan is
an excellent source of intelligence on China, just as Israel is on the
Middle East, and South Korea is on North Korea. The briefing, from
Taiwan's National Defense University, alleges that China has developed
Super-EMP weapons, having very low yield, working from nuclear weapons
design information stolen from the United States. There is no dearth of
Chinese military doctrinal writings on EMP and its efficacy against the
United States.33 Dr. [Butt's reliance on the work of Sandia Labs
examining the vulnerability of nuclear power plants in the early 1980s,
nearly 30 years ago, is misplaced, as the work is now obsolete. Digital
controls were not as prevalent then, or as vulnerable to E1, as they are
today.]{.underline} Dr. Butt's statement that the "Earth's magnetic
field varies across the globe and also varies with time at a given
location" apparently confuses the geomagnetic field created by the
Earth's core with the very minor variations in the geomagnetic field by
the telluric variations (typically a few nT). The geomagnetic field
variation induced by a geomagnetic storm or nuclear E3 HEMP can be on
the order of several thousand nT. Finally, Dr. Butt describes Dr. Peter
Vincent Pry as one of the EMP Commissioners. Dr. Pry was not an EMP
Commissioner, but was on the Commission staff.

Weinberger accuses the EMP Commission of deliberately \"exaggerating the

as deliberately misrepresenting the facts about the EMP threat would
constitute an ethical and legal violation. As evidence, Weinberger
offers the opinion of Philip Coyle of the Center for Defense
Information. [Whatever Coyle\'s opinion may be, he is no authority on
the commission\'s work and has participated in none of it. In any case,
even he only accuses the EMP Commission of using \"inflammatory

the EMP Commission\'s staff, I can assure the public that **[the EMP

## 2NC\-\--AT: AI D

### 2NC\-\--AI Impact

#### AI outweighs

#### a. On magnitude\-\--AI engineers a dystopia [worse]{.underline} than extinction.

Toby **Ord 20**, senior research fellow in philosophy at Oxford
University and world-renowned risk-assessment expert who has advised
WHO, the World Bank, the WEF, and the US National Intelligence Council,
3/3/2020, *The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity*,
pp. 194-196, cc

[**Losing our potential** means getting **locked into** a **bad set of
futures**]{.underline}. We can categorize existential catastrophes by
looking at which aspects of our future get locked in. [This could
be]{.underline} a world without humans (**[extinction]{.underline}**) or
a world without civilization (unrecoverable collapse). [But it could
also take the form of an **unrecoverable dystopia**]{.underline}---a
world with civilization intact, but locked into a terrible form,
[with]{.underline} little or no value.116

\[Footnote 116\]

In the worst cases, [perhaps even **negative value**---an outcome
**worse than extinction**]{.underline}.

\[Footnote 116 ends\]

This has not happened yet, but the past provides little comfort. For
these kinds of catastrophes only became possible with the advent of
civilization, so our track record is much shorter. And there is reason
to think that the risks may increase over time as the world becomes more
interconnected and experiments with new technologies and ideologies.

I won't attempt to address these dystopian scenarios with the same level
of scientific detail as the risks we've explored so far, for the
scenarios are diverse and our present understanding of them very
limited. Instead, my aim is just to take some early steps toward
noticing and understanding these very different kinds of failure.

We can divide the unrecoverable dystopias we might face into three
types, on the basis of whether they are desired by the people who live
in them. There are possibilities where the people don't want that world,
yet the structure of society makes it almost impossible for them to
coordinate to change it. There are possibilities where the people do
want that world, yet they are misguided and the world falls far short of
what they could have achieved. And in between there are possibilities
where only a small group wants that world but enforces it against the
wishes of the rest. Each of these types has different hurdles it would
need to overcome in order to become truly locked in.

Note that to count as existential catastrophes, these outcomes don't
need to be impossible to break out of, nor to last millions of years.
Instead, the defining feature is that entering that regime was a crucial
negative turning point in the history of human potential, locking off
almost all our potential for a worthy future. One way to look at this is
that when they end (as they eventually must), we are much more likely
than we were before to fall down to extinction or collapse than to rise
up to fulfill our potential. For example, a dystopian society that
lasted all the way until humanity was destroyed by external forces would
be an existential catastrophe. However, if a dystopian outcome does not
have this property, if it leaves open all our chances for success once
it ends---it is a dark age in our story, but not a true existential
catastrophe.

[The most familiar type is the **enforced dystopia**. The]{.underline}
rise of **[expansionist totalitarianism]{.underline}** in the
mid-twentieth century caused intellectuals such as George Orwell to
raise the possibility of a totalitarian state achieving global dominance
and absolute control, locking the world into a miserable condition.117
The regimes [of **Hitler** and **Stalin** serve as a **proof of
principle**]{.underline}, each [scaling up to become **imperial
superpowers** while maintaining **extreme control**]{.underline} over
their citizens.118 However, it is unclear whether Hitler or Stalin had
the expansionist aims to control the entire world, or the technical and
social means to create truly lasting regimes.119

This may change. **[Technological progress]{.underline}** has [offered
**many new tools** that]{.underline} could be used to [detect and
undermine dissent]{.underline}, and there is every reason to believe
that this will continue over the next century. [**Advances in AI** seem
**especially relevant**, allowing automated]{.underline}, detailed
**[monitoring of everything]{.underline}** that happens in public
places--- both physical and online. [Such]{.underline} advances may
[make it possible to have **regimes** that are **far more stable** than
those of old.]{.underline}

That said, technology is also providing new tools for rebellion against
authority, such as the internet and encrypted messages. Perhaps the
forces will remain in balance, or shift in favor of freedom, but there
is a credible chance that they will shift toward greater control over
the populace, making enforced dystopias a realistic possibility.

A second kind of unrecoverable dystopia is a stable civilization that is
desired by few (if any) people. It is easy to see how such an outcome
could be dystopian, but not immediately obvious how we could arrive at
it, or lock it in, if most (or all) people do not want it.120

The answer lies in the various population-level forces that can shape
global outcomes. Well-known examples include market forces creating a
race to the bottom, Malthusian population dynamics pushing down the
average quality of life, or evolution optimizing us toward the spreading
of our genes, regardless of the effects on what we value. These are all
dynamics that push humanity toward a new equilibrium, where these forces
are finally in balance. But there is no guarantee this equilibrium will
be good.

For example, consider the tension between what is best for each and what
is best for all. This is studied in the field of game theory through
"games" like the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons,
where each individual's incentives push them toward producing a
collectively terrible outcome. The Nash equilibrium (the outcome we
reach if we follow individual incentives) may be much worse for everyone
than some other outcome we could have achieved if we had overcome these
local incentives.

The most famous example is environmental degradation, such as pollution.
Because most of the costs of pollution aren't borne by the person who
causes it, we can end up in a situation where it is in the self-interest
of each person to keep engaging in such activities, despite this making
us all worse off. It took significant moral progress and significant
political action to help us break out of this. We may end up in new
traps that are even harder to coordinate our way out of. This could be
at the level of individuals, or at the level of groups. We could have
nations, ideological blocs, or even planets or descendent species of
Homo sapiens locked in harmful competition---doing what is best for
their group, but bad for groups on the whole.

I don't know how likely it is that we suffer a sufficiently bad (and
sufficiently intractable) tragedy of the commons like this. Or that we
are degraded by evolutionary pressures, or driven to lives of very low
quality by Malthusian population dynamics, or any other such situation.
I'd like to hope that we could always see such things coming and
coordinate to a solution. But it's hard to be sure that we could.

[The third possibility is the "**desired dystopia**."]{.underline}121
Here it is easier to see how universal desire for an outcome might cause
us to lock it in, though less clear how such an outcome could be
dystopian. The problem is that there are many compelling ideas that can
radically shape our future ---especially ideologies and moral theories,
as these make direct normative claims about the world we should strive
to create. [If combined with the **technological or social
means**]{.underline} for instilling the same views in the next
generation (indoctrination, surveillance), [this has the potential to be
**disastrous**]{.underline}.

The historical record is rife with examples of seriously defective
ideologies and moral views that gripped large parts of the world.
Moreover, even reasonable normative views often recommend that they be
locked in---for otherwise a tempting rival view may take over, with
(allegedly) disastrous results.122 Even though the most plausible moral
views have a lot of agreement about which small changes to the world are
good and which are bad, they tend to come strongly apart in their
recommendations about what an optimal world would look like. [This
problem]{.underline} thus [echoes]{.underline} that of [**AI
alignment**, where a **strong push** toward a **mostly correct ideal**
could instead **spell disaster**]{.underline}.

Some plausible examples include: worlds that completely renounce further
technological progress (which ensures our destruction at the hands of
natural risks),123 worlds that forever fail to recognize some key form
of harm or injustice (and thus perpetuate it blindly), worlds that lock
in a single fundamentalist religion, and worlds where we deliberately
replace ourselves with something that we didn't realize was much less
valuable (such as machines incapable of feeling).124

All of these unrecoverable dystopias can be understood in terms of
lock-in. [**Key aspects** of]{.underline} the future of the
[civilization are]{.underline} being [**locked in** such that they are
almost **impossible to change**]{.underline}. If we are locked into a
sufficiently bad set of futures, [we have an **unrecoverable dystopia**;
an **existential catastrophe**]{.underline}.

of belief [that **each of the catastrophes** will befall us **this

of the information and argumentation in the chapters on the risks.
Instead, [they rely on an **accumulation of knowledge** and **judgment**
on each risk]{.underline} that goes beyond what can be distilled into a
few pages. They are not in any way a final word, but are a concise
summary of all I know about the risk landscape.

TABLE 6.1 My best estimates for the chance of an existential catastrophe
from each of these sources occurring at some point in the next 100 years
(when the catastrophe has delayed effects, like climate change, I'm
talking about the point of no return coming within 100 years). There is
significant uncertainty remaining in these estimates and they should be
treated as representing the right order of magnitude---each could easily
be a factor of 3 higher or lower. Note that the numbers don't quite add
up: both because doing so would create a false feeling of precision and
for subtle reasons covered in the section on "Combining Risks."

One of the most striking features of this risk landscape is how widely
the probabilities vary between different risks. Some are a million times
more likely than others, and few share even the same order of magnitude.
This variation occurs between the classes of risk too: I estimate
anthropogenic risks to be more than 1,000 times more likely than natural
risks.6 And within anthropogenic risks, [I estimate **the risks from
future technologies** to be roughly **100 times larger** than **those of
existing ones**]{.underline}, giving a substantial escalation in risk
from Chapter 3 to 4 to 5.

Such variation may initially be surprising, but it is remarkably common
in science to find distributions like this spanning many orders of
magnitude, where the top outliers make up most of the total. This
variation makes it extremely important to prioritize our efforts on the
right risks. And it also makes our estimate of the total risk very
sensitive to [the estimates of the **top few risks**]{.underline} (which
[are among the **least well understood**]{.underline}). So [getting
**better understanding** and **estimates** for those becomes a **key
priority**]{.underline}.

In my view, [the greatest risk to **humanity's potential**]{.underline}
in the next hundred years [comes from **unaligned artificial
intelligence**]{.underline}, which I put [at one in ten]{.underline}.
One might be surprised to see such a high number for such a speculative
risk, so it warrants some explanation.

A common approach to estimating the chance of an unprecedented event
with earth-shaking consequences is to take a skeptical stance: to start
with an extremely small probability and only raise it from there when a
large amount of hard evidence is presented. But I disagree. Instead, I
think the right method is to start with a probability that reflects our
overall impressions, then adjust this in light of the scientific
evidence.7 When there is a lot of evidence, these approaches converge.
But when there isn't, the starting point can matter.

In the case of artificial intelligence, everyone agrees the evidence and
arguments are far from watertight, but the question is where does this
leave us? Very roughly, my approach is to start with [the **overall
view** of the **expert community**]{.underline} that there [is something
like a **one in two** chance that **AI agents**]{.underline} capable of
**[outperforming humans]{.underline}** in almost every task [will be
developed in the **coming century**]{.underline}. And conditional on
that happening, we shouldn't be shocked if these agents that outperform
us across the board were to inherit our future. Especially if when
looking into the details, we see great challenges in aligning these
agents with our values.

Some of my colleagues give higher chances than me, and some lower. But
for many purposes our numbers are similar. Suppose you were more
skeptical of the risk and thought it to be one in 100. From an
informational perspective, that is actually not so far apart: it doesn't
take all that much evidence to shift someone from one to the other. And
it might not be that far apart [in terms of **practical
action**]{.underline} either---[an existential **risk** of either
probability would be a **key global priority**]{.underline}.

#### AFF cards are [profit politicized skepticism]{.underline}\-\--err NEG.

Seth D. **Baum 18**, executive director of the Global Catastrophic Risk
Institute and PhD in geography from Penn State, 8/22/2018,
"Superintelligence Skepticism as a Political Tool," *Information*, 9(9),
<https://doi.org/10.3390/info9090209>, cc

[The]{.underline} purpose of this [paper]{.underline} is to [explore the
**potential for skepticism** about **artificial superintelligence** to
be used for **political ends**]{.underline}. Artificial
superintelligence (for brevity, henceforth just superintelligence)
refers to AI that is much smarter than humans. Current AI is not
superintelligent, but the prospect of superintelligence is a topic of
much discussion in scholarly and public spheres. [Some]{.underline}
[believe that **superintelligence** could]{.underline} someday be built,
and that, if it is built, it would [have **massive** and]{.underline}
potentially [**catastrophic** consequences]{.underline}. [Others are
**skeptical**]{.underline} of these beliefs. While much of the existing
skepticism appears to be honest intellectual debate, [there is potential
for it to be **politicized**]{.underline} for other purposes.

In simple terms (to be refined below), politicized skepticism can be
defined as public articulation of skepticism that is intended to achieve
some outcome other than an improved understanding of the topic at hand.
Politicized skepticism can be contrasted with intellectual skepticism,
which seeks an improved understanding. Intellectual skepticism is
essential to scholarly inquiry; politicized skepticism is not. The
distinction between the two is not always clear; statements of
skepticism may have both intellectual and political motivations. The two
concepts can nonetheless be useful for understanding debates over issues
such as superintelligence.

There is substantial precedent for politicized skepticism. Of particular
relevance for superintelligence is politicized skepticism about
technologies and products that are risky but profitable, henceforth
risk--profit politicized skepticism. This practice dates to 1950s
debates over the link between tobacco and cancer and has since been
dubbed the tobacco strategy \[1\]. More recently, the strategy has been
applied to other issues including the link between fossil fuels and acid
rain, the link between fossil fuels and global warming, and the link
between industrial chemicals and neurological disease \[1,2\].
[The]{.underline} essence of the [strategy]{.underline} is to [promote
the idea that the science underlying **certain risks** is
**unresolved**, and]{.underline} therefore [the **implicated
technologies** **should not be regulated**]{.underline}. The strategy is
typically employed by an interconnected mix of industry interests and
ideological opponents of regulation. The target audience is typically a
mix of government officials and the general public, and not the
scientific community.

As is discussed in more detail below, certain [factors suggest the
**potential for superintelligence** to be a focus of]{.underline}
risk--profit **[politicized skepticism]{.underline}**. First and
foremost, [superintelligence could be developed by **major
corporations** with a **strong financial incentive** to **avoid
regulation**]{.underline}. Second, there already exists a lot of
[skepticism]{.underline} about superintelligence, which [could be
**exploited** for political purposes]{.underline}. Third, as an
unprecedented class of technology, it is inherently uncertain, which
suggests that superintelligence skepticism may be especially durable,
even within apolitical scholarly communities. These and other factors do
not guarantee that superintelligence skepticism will be politicized, or
that its politicization would follow the same risk--profit patterns as
the tobacco strategy. However, these factors are at least suggestive of
the possibility.

Superintelligence [skepticism may also be politicized]{.underline} in a
different way: [to protect the **reputations and funding** of the
**broader AI field**]{.underline}. This form of politicized skepticism
is less well-documented than the tobacco strategy, and appears to be
less common. However, there are at least hints of it for fields of
technology involving both grandiose future predictions and more mundane
near-term work. AI is one such field of technology, in which grandiose
predictions of superintelligence and other future AI breakthroughs
contrast with more modest forms of near-term AI. Another example is
nanotechnology, in which grandiose predictions of molecular machines
contrast with near-term nanoscale science and technology \[3\].

### 2NC\-\--AT: Shermer

#### Shermer defense is pure silliness.

Dr. Olle **Häggström 17**, professor of mathematical statistics, PhD
from the Chalmers University of Technology, research specialist in AI,
9/17/2017, "Michael Shermer fails in his attempt to argue that AI is not
an existential threat,"
http://haggstrom.blogspot.com/2017/09/michael-shermer-fails-in-his-attempt-to.html?m=1,
cc

[Why Artificial Intelligence is Not an Existential Threat]{.underline}
is an aticle [by]{.underline} leading science writer **[Michael
Shermer]{.underline}**1 in the recent issue 2/2017 of his journal
Skeptic (mostly behind paywall). How I wish he had a good case for the
claim contained in the title! But alas, the [arguments]{.underline} he
provides [are **weak**, bordering on **pure silliness**]{.underline}.
Shermer is certainly not the first high-profile figure to react to the
theory of AI (artificial intelligence) existential risk, as developed by
Eliezer Yudkowsky, Nick Bostrom and others, with an intuitive feeling
that it cannot possibly be right, and the (slightly megalomaniacal)
sense of being able to refute the theory, single-handedly and
[with]{.underline} very **[moderate intellectual effort]{.underline}**.
Previous such attempts, by Steven Pinker and by John Searle, were
exposed as mistaken in my book Here Be Dragons, and the purpose of the
present blog post is to do the analogous thing to Shermer\'s arguments.

The first half of Shermer\'s article is a
not-very-deep-but-reasonably-competent summary of some of the main ideas
of why an AI breakthrough might be an existential risk to humanity. He
cites the leading thinkers of the field: Eliezer Yudkowsky, Nick Bostrom
and Stuart Russell, along with famous endorsements from Elon Musk,
Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates and Sam Harris.

The second half, [where Shermer **sets out to refute** the idea of **AI
as an existential threat**]{.underline} to humanity, [is where things go
**off rails**]{.underline} pretty much immediately. Let me point out
[**three bad mistakes** in **his reasoning**]{.underline}. The main one
is (1), while (2) and (3) are included mainly as additional
illustrations of the sloppiness of Shermer\'s thinking.

\(1\) [Shermer states]{.underline} that

most [**AI doomsday prophecies** are grounded in the **false analogy**
between **human nature** and **computer nature**]{.underline},

whose falsehood lies in the fact that humans have emotions, while
computers do not. It is highly doubtful whether there is a useful sense
of the term emotion for which a claim like that holds generally, and in
any case [Shermer **mangles** the reasoning behind **Paperclip
Armageddon**]{.underline} - an example that he discusses earlier in his
article. [If the **superintelligent AI**]{.underline} programmed to
maximize the production of paperclips decides to [**wipe out humanity**,
it does this because it has]{.underline} [**calculated** that wiping out
humanity is]{.underline} an **[efficient step]{.underline}** towards
paperclip maximization. [Whether]{.underline} [to ascribe]{.underline}
to the AI doing so [an emotion like aggression seems]{.underline} like
an **[unimportant]{.underline}** (for the present purpose) matter of
definition. In any case, there is nothing fundamentally impossible or
mysterious in an AI taking such a step. The error in Shermer\'s claim
that it takes aggression to wipe out humanity and that an AI cannot
experience aggression is easiest to see [**if** we apply his argument to
a **simpler device** such as a **heat-seeking missile**]{.underline}.
Typically [**for such a missile**, if it finds something
warm]{.underline} (such as an enemy vehicle) up [ahead]{.underline}
slightly [to the left]{.underline}, then [it will **steer slightly** to
the **left**]{.underline}. But by Shermer\'s account, such steering
cannot happen, because it requires aggression on the part of the
heat-seeking missile, and a heat-seeking missile obviously cannot
experience aggression, so wee need not worry about heat-seeking missiles
(any more than we need to worry about a paperclip maximizer).2

**[(2)]{.underline}** Citing a famous passage by Pinker, [Shermer
writes]{.underline}:

As Steven Pinker wrote in his answer to the 2015 Edge Question on what
to think about machines that think, \"[**AI dystopias** project a
**parochial alpha-male psychology** onto the **concept of
intelligence**]{.underline}. They assume that superhumanly intelligent
robots would develop goals like deposing their masters or taking over
the world.\" [It is]{.underline} equally **[possible]{.underline}**,
Pinker suggests, that \"[**a**rtificial **i**ntelligence]{.underline}
will naturally [develop along **female lines**]{.underline}: fully
capable of solving problems, but with no desire to annihilate innocents
or dominate the civilization.\" So the fear that computers will become
emotionally evil are unfounded \[\...\].

Even if we accepted Pinker\'s analysis,3 [**Shermer\'s conclusion** is
**utterly unreasonable**, based]{.underline} as it is [on]{.underline}
the following [**faulty logic**: If a **dangerous scenario A** is
discussed, and we can give a]{.underline} [**scenario B that is
\"equally possible\"**, then we have shown]{.underline} that [A **will
not happen**]{.underline}.

[Humanity occupies a very small place in an unfathomably vast
Universe]{.underline}. Travelling at the speed of light -- 671 million
miles per hour -- it would take us 100,000 years to cross the Milky Way.
But we still wouldn't have gone very far. [Our modest Milky Way galaxy
contains 100--400 billion stars.]{.underline} This isn't very much:
[according to the latest calculations, the observable universe contains
around 300 sextillion stars.]{.underline} By recent estimates, [our
Milky Way galaxy is just one of 2 trillion galaxies in the observable
Universe, and the region of space that they occupy spans at least 90
billion light-years. If you imagine Earth shrunk down to the size of a
single grain of sand, and you imagine the size of that grain of sand
relative to the entirety of the Sahara Desert, you are still nowhere
near to comprehending how infinitesimally small a position we occupy in
space]{.underline}. The American astronomer Carl Sagan put the point
vividly in 1994 when discussing the famous 'Pale Blue Dot' photograph
taken by Voyager 1. [Our planet,]{.underline} he said, [is nothing more
than 'a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam']{.underline}. Stephen
Hawking delivers the news more bluntly. We are, he says, "just a
chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet, orbiting round a very average
star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies." [And
that's just the spatial dimension. The]{.underline} observable [Universe
has existed for around 13.8 billion years.]{.underline} [If we shrink
that span of time down to a single year, with the Big Bang occurring at
midnight on 1 January, the first Homo sapiens made an appearance at
22:24 on 31 December. It's now 23:59:59]{.underline}, as it has been for
the past 438 years, and at the rate we're going [it's entirely possible
that we'll be gone before midnight strikes again]{.underline}. [The
Universe]{.underline}, on the other hand, [might well continue existing
forever]{.underline}, for all we know. Sagan could have added, then,
that [our time]{.underline} on this mote of dust [will amount to nothing
more than a blip]{.underline}. In the grand scheme of things [we
are very, very small.]{.underline} For Sagan, the Pale Blue Dot
underscores our responsibility to treat one another with kindness and
compassion. But reflection on the vastness of the Universe and our
physical and temporal smallness within it often takes on an altogether
darker hue. [If the Universe is so large]{.underline}, and we are so
small and so fleeting, doesn't it follow that [we are utterly
insignificant and inconsequential]{.underline}? This thought can be a
spur to nihilism. If we are so insignificant, if [our existence is so
trivial]{.underline}, how could anything we do or are -- our successes
and failures, our anxiety and sadness and joy, all our busy ambition and
toil and endeavour, all that makes up the material of our lives -- how
could any of that possibly matter? [To think of one's place in the
cosmos]{.underline}, as the American philosopher Susan Wolf puts it in
'The Meanings of Lives' (2007), [is 'to recognise the possibility of a
perspective ... from which one's life is merely
gratuitous']{.underline}. The sense that we are somehow insignificant
seems to be widely felt. The American author John Updike expressed it in
1985 when he wrote of modern science that: [We shrink from what it has
to tell us of our perilous and insignificant place in the
cosmos]{.underline} ... [our century's revelations of unthinkable
largeness and unimaginable smallness]{.underline}, of abysmal stretches
of geological time when we were nothing, of supernumerary galaxies ...
of a kind of mad mathematical violence at the heart of the matter have
scorched us deeper than we know. In a similar vein, the French
philosopher Blaise Pascal wrote in *Pensées* (1669): When I consider the
short duration of my life, swallowed up in an eternity before and after,
the little space I fill engulfed in the infinite immensity of spaces
whereof I know nothing, and which know nothing of me, I am terrified.
The eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me. Commenting on
this passage in *Between Man and Man* (1947), the Austrian-Israeli
philosopher Martin Buber said that Pascal had experienced the
'uncanniness of the heavens', and thereby came to know 'man's
limitation, his inadequacy, the casualness of his existence'. In the
film *Monty Python's* *The Meaning of Life* (1983), John Cleese and Eric
Idle conspire to persuade a character, played by Terry Gilliam, to give
up her liver for donation. Understandably reluctant, she is eventually
won over by a song that sharply details just how comically
inconsequential she is in the cosmic frame. Even the relatively upbeat
Sagan wasn't, in fact, immune to the pessimistic point of view. As well
as viewing it as a lesson in the need for collective goodwill, he also
argued that [the Pale Blue Dot challenges]{.underline} 'our posturings,
[our imagined self-importance, and the delusion that we have some
privileged position in the Universe]{.underline}'. When we reflect on
the vastness of the universe, our humdrum cosmic location, and the
inevitable future demise of humanity, our lives can seem utterly
insignificant. As we complacently go about our little Earthly affairs,
we barely notice the black backdrop of the night sky. Even when we do,
we usually see the starry skies as no more than a pleasant twinkling
decoration. This sense of cosmic insignificance is not uncommon; one of
Joseph Conrad's characters describes one of those dewy, clear, starry
nights, oppressing our spirit, crushing our pride, by the brilliant
evidence of the awful loneliness, of the hopeless obscure insignificance
of our globe lost in the splendid revelation of a glittering, soulless
universe. I hate such skies. The young Bertrand Russell, a close friend
of Conrad, bitterly referred to the Earth as "the petty planet on which
our bodies impotently craw." Russell wrote that: Brief and powerless is
Man's life; on him and all his race the slow, sure doom falls pitiless
and dark. Blind to good and evil, reckless of destruction, omnipotent
matter rolls on its relentless way...This is why Russell thought that,
in the absence of God, we must build our lives on "a foundation of
unyielding despair." When we consider ourselves as a mere dot in a vast
universe, when we consider ourselves in light of everything there is,
nothing human seems to matter. [**Even the worst human tragedy may seem
to deserve no cosmic concern**. After all, we are fighting for attention
with an incredibly vast totality. How could this tiny speck of dust
deserve even a fraction of attention, from that universal point of
view?]{.underline} This is the image that is evoked when, for example,
Simon Blackburn writes that "to a witness with the whole of space and
time in its view, nothing on the human scale will have meaning". Such
quotations could be easily multiplied---we find similar remarks, for
example, in John Donne, Voltaire, Schopenhauer, Byron, Tolstoy,
Chesterton, Camus, and, in recent philosophy, in Thomas Nagel, Harry
Frankfurt, and Ronald Dworkin. The bigger the picture we survey, the
smaller the part of any point within it, and the less attention it can
get... When we try to imagine a viewpoint encompassing the entire
universe, humanity and its concerns seem to get completely swallowed up
in the void. [Over the centuries, many have thought it absurd to think
that we are the only ones]{.underline}. For example, Anaxagoras,
Epicurus, Lucretius, and, later, Giordano Bruno, Huygens and Kepler were
all confident that [the universe is teeming with life.]{.underline} Kant
was willing to bet everything he had on the existence of intelligent
life on other planets. And [we now know that there is a vast multitude
of Earth-like planets even in our own little galaxy.]{.underline} The
experience of cosmic insignificance is often blamed on the rise of
modern science, and the decline of religious belief. Many think that
things started to take a turn for the worse with Copernicus. Nietzsche,
for example, laments 'the nihilistic consequences of contemporary
science', and adds that Since Copernicus it seems that man has found
himself on a descending slope---he always rolls further and further away
from his point of departure toward... ---where is that? Towards
nothingness? Freud later wrote about a series of harsh blows to our
self-esteem delivered by science. The first blow was delivered by
Copernicus, when we learned, as Freud puts it, that "[our earth was not
the centre of the universe but only a tiny fragment of a cosmic system
of scarcely imaginable vastness]{.underline}..." It is still common to
refer, in a disappointed tone, to the discovery that [we aren't at the
centre]{.underline} of God's creation, as we had long thought,
[but]{.underline} located, as Carl Sagan puts it, "[in some forgotten
corner]{.underline}". We live, Sagan writes, "[on a mote of dust
circling a humdrum star in the remotest corner of an obscure
galaxy]{.underline}."

[**Once we hold alien interests as equal to our own** we can begin to
revaluate areas previously believed to hold no relevance to life beyond
this planet. A diverse group of scholars including]{.underline} Richard
[Posner]{.underline}, Senior Lecturer in Law at the University of

University, John [Leslie]{.underline} philosophy professor at Guelph
University [and]{.underline} Martin [Rees]{.underline}, Britain's

obligation to aliens, Posner, Bostrom, Leslie, and Ree's rhetoric would
not be "just," because **[it arbitrarily declares other life forms
unworthy of consideration]{.underline}**. A framework of acknowledgement
would allow humanity to address the risks of these new technologies,
while [being cognizant of humanity's obligations to other life within
the universe]{.underline}. [Applying the lens of acknowledgment to the
issue of existential threats moves the problem]{.underline} **[from one
of self destruction to universal genocide]{.underline}**. This may be
the most dramatic example of how **[refusing to extend acknowledgment to

[The nature of the nanoscale risk is quite different from the risks
posed by]{.underline} (say) [nuclear weapons]{.underline}. The [nuclear
arsenals of the Earth remain under the control of a very small number of
individuals]{.underline}. As [genetic engineering and
nanotechnology]{.underline} mature as fields of research, [the ability
to manipulate the nanoscale becomes available to an increasing number of
individuals]{.underline}. **[Any one of these individuals could
accidentally (or purposefully) trigger a catastrophic event that
destroys a civilisation]{.underline}**. [If there are E individuals with
access to potentially destructive technology, and the probability that
an individual destroys civilisation in any given year is P, then we can
define the probability that the civilisation exists after time t and can
communicate, C]{.underline}, as a set of independent Bernoulli trials,
i.e., P(C\|t, E, P) = (1 − P)Et . (14.1) Therefore, we can compute the
number of civilisations existing between t = 0, t0 as N(t0) = B t0 0
P(C\|t , E, P)dt (14.2) where we have assumed a constant birth rate B.
This can be easily integrated to show (Sotos, 2017): N(t0) = B St0 − 1
ln S , S = (1 − P)E (14.3) At large t, this tends to the steady-state
solution N(t) → B E P (14.4) i.e., there is an inverse relationship
between the number of individuals in a given civilisation, and the
number of civilisations remaining (Figure 14.1). [The generality of this
solution to Fermi's Paradox]{.underline} -- that the [democracy of
technology is the cause of its downfall]{.underline} -- is particularly
powerful. [All we have assumed is that technology can be
destructive]{.underline}, and that [it eventually becomes accessible to
a large enough number of individuals that the product E P becomes
sufficiently large]{.underline}. [The number of communicating
civilisations as a function of time, given E individuals causing
self-destruction with a probability of P per individual per
year]{.underline}. [The civilisation birth rate B is fixed at one per
year]{.underline}. [This is a sufficiently general solution]{.underline}
that we may consider it to be hard -- our definition of [intelligence
hinges on technology]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} almost [all
advanced technology has a destructive use]{.underline}. We can already
use the Great Silence to rule out the upper curves in Figure 14.1, which
[would yield civilisation counts that would be visible on
Earth]{.underline} (see also section 19.2). This suggests that if this
is the solution to Fermi's Paradox, then roughly [E P \>

Nanotechnology is best described as a general capacity, rather than a
specific tool. In relation to infinite impacts this is a challenge, as
[there are many ways that nanotechnology can be used that could result
in infinite impacts]{.underline}, [but also many others where it can
help reduce infinite impacts.]{.underline} [Different possible sequences
from today's situation to precise atomic manufacturing are well
documented and the probability that none of the possible paths would
deliver results is very small]{.underline}. [What specific sequence and
with what results is however very uncertain.]{.underline} [Compared with
many other global challenges nanotechnology could result in many
different risks]{.underline} - and opportunities, [from an accelerated
ability to manufacture (new) weapons]{.underline}623 [to the creation of
new materials and substances]{.underline}. [These are certainly orders
of magnitude more likely]{.underline}, far likelier than any probability
of the ["grey goo"]{.underline} that has [resulted in significant
misunderstanding]{.underline}. The data availability is difficult to
estimate as there are very different kinds of data, and also an obvious
lack of data, as nanotechnology is in its very early days. There are
some estimates from experts, but the uncertainty is significant. A
relative probability estimate is a possible ffrst step, comparing
nanotechnology solutions with existing systems where the probability is
better known. Admiral David E. Jeremiah, for example, said at the 1995
Foresight Conference on Molecular Technology: "**[Military applications
of molecular manufacturing have even greater potential than nuclear
weapons to radically change the balance of power]{.underline}**." 624 [A
systems forecasting approach could probably provide better estimates and
help develop complementary measures that would support the positive
parts of nanotechnology while reducing the negative.]{.underline}

The comparison to biology is apt, but it is [not clear how convincing
his idea is that it would take "some maniac" to initiate grey
goo]{.underline} "for this very purpose."313 Can we state with certainty
**[that it cannot happen by mistake?]{.underline}** It is true that
self-replication will require "clever design," but [we can expect
non-maniac nanotechnology engineers to attempt that, as it seems to be
the most promising way to produce nanobots in the huge quantities we
will need for a variety of applications]{.underline}. Such construction
will presumably be done with a degree of precaution so as to avoid the
self-replication going overboard as in the grey goo scenario, but such
[precautions could fail.]{.underline} At this point, the grey goo
skeptic could point again to biology, and the fact that life has existed
on our planet for billions of years without turning into grey (or green)
goo, as an argument for why self-replication is unlikely to
spontaneously produce such a catastrophe. While this argument has some
force, it is far from conclusive, as the newly formed nanobots may, in
the abstract space of possible living organisms, be located quite far
from all biological life, and have very different physical and chemical
properties. It is [hardly absurd to think that this might give the
nanobots a robust reproductive power unmatched by anything that the
evolution of biological life has discovered.]{.underline} At the very
least, this issue deserves further study. A possible middle ground could
be that, on one hand, [it is possible to proceed with nanobot technology
without risking a grey goo scenario, provided that we respect certain
safety protocols, whereas, on the other hand, grey goo would be a real
danger without these precautions]{.underline}. Phoenix and Drexler
(2004) have a number of suggestions for how nanobots can be made to
self-replicate in controlled and safe fashion. A key insight is that the
self-replication ability of an agent (be it a biological organism or a
robot) is always contingent on its environment. Even a set of
blacksmith's tools can, in the right environment (one that provides
suitable input of skills and muscle power), produce a duplicate set, and
can thus be described as self-replicating. **[What is always needed for
self-replication capability is the raw material and energy needed to
produce the replicates]{.underline}**.314 Hence, **[we could avoid grey
goo if we construct the self-replicating machines to contain elements
not available in the natural environment]{.underline}**. But we may not
even have to go that far. Phoenix and Drexler point out that a
general-purpose molecular assembler will typically not be a general
purpose molecular disassembler. It will, most likely, be far easier to
construct an APM machine that requires its raw material to be delivered
in the form of a limited range of simple chemicals (such as acetylene or
acetone), rather than having the ability to extract molecular fragments
and atoms from arbitrary chemical compounds. Suppose that we regulate
the technology so as to make a specific list of sufficient safety
precautions obligatory. [With a risk such as grey goo, where the
consequences of a single mishap could be global and even put an end to
humanity, it is clearly not sufficient that most practitioners of the
technology adhere to the regulatio]{.underline}n, or that almost all of
them do: anything short of obedience to regulation from all
practitioners would be unsatisfactory. Can this be ensured? This is not
clear. Kurzweil (2006) advocates another safety layer, in the form of
nanobots specifically designed to fight grey-goo-like outbreaks.
**[Without defenses, the available biomass could be destroyed by gray
goo very rapidly]{.underline}**. Clearly, we will need a nanotechnology
immune system in place before these scenarios become a possibility. . .
. Eric Drexler, Robert Freitas, Ralph Merkle, Mike Treder, Chris
Phoenix, and others have pointed out that [future nanotech manufacturing
devices can be created with safeguards that would prevent the accidental
creation of self-replicating nanodevices]{.underline}. However, this
observation, although important, **[does not eliminate the threat of
gray goo]{.underline}** as I pointed out above. There are other reasons
(beyond manufacturing) that self-replicating nanobots will need to be
created. **[The nanotechnology immune system mentioned above, for
example, will ultimately require self-replication;]{.underline}**
**[otherwise it would be unable to defend us against the development of
increasingly sophisticated types of goo.]{.underline}** It is also
likely to find extensive military applications. Moreover, a [determined
adversary or terrorist can defeat safeguards against unwanted
self-replication]{.underline}; hence, the need for defense. The
suggestion of setting up this kind of defense system against grey goo --
which Kurzweil elsewhere calls "police nanobots" and "blue goo"315 --
goes back to Drexler (1986). It makes me very uneasy. Joy (2000) points
out that the system.

#### Nano regulation is impossible

Stephen J. **Ridge 18**, Master of Arts in Security Studies from the
Naval Postgraduate School, Assistant Senior Watch Officer, U.S.
Department of Homeland Security, National Operations Center, "A
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR NANOTECHNOLOGY", Thesis, March, p. 2-4

[There are many roadblocks to developing suitable nanotechnology
regulation]{.underline}. [One major roadblock for nanotechnology
regulation stems from the lack of consensus on the definition of
nanotechnology]{.underline}. [It is difficult to construct an
architectural framework for nanotechnology regulation when many leaders
within the field cannot agree on what the term even means]{.underline}.
[According to]{.underline} Andrew Maynard, Professor in the School for
the Future of Innovation in Society at Arizona State University and
[co-chair of the World Economic Forum Global Agenda Council on
Nanotechnology]{.underline}, "[**a sensible definition** \[for
nanotechnology\] **has proved** hard, if not **impossible**, to arrive
at]{.underline}."3 A brief perusal of nanotechnology stakeholders
reveals a myriad of definitions upon which their interaction with the
technology is based. For instance, nanotechnology is defined by the U.S.
National Nanotechnology Initiative as the understanding and control of
matter at dimensions between approximately 1 and 100 nanometers where
unique phenomena enable novel applications. Encompassing nanoscale
science, engineering, and technology, nanotechnology involves imaging,
measuring, modeling, and manipulating matter at this length scale.4 In
2010, the European Commission released this definition for public
comment: "a material that consists of particles with one or more
external dimensions in the size range 1 nm-100 nm for more than 1
percent of their number;" and/or "has internal or surface structures in
one or more dimensions in the size range 1 nm-100 nm;" and/or "has a
greater than 60 m2/ cm3, excluding materials consisting of particles
with a size lower than 1 nm, excluding materials consisting of particles
with a size lower than 1 nm."5 In the 2003 law 21st Century
Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, the U.S. Congress defines
"nanotechnology" as "the science and technology that will enable one to
understand, measure, manipulate, and manufacture at the atomic,
molecular, and supramolecular levels, aimed at creating materials,
devices, and systems with fundamentally new molecular organization,
properties, and functions."6 The inaugural issue of Nature
Nanotechnology in 2006 asked a wide array of researchers,
industrialists, and scientists what nanotechnology means to them.
Unsurprisingly, [the 13 different individuals queried yielded 13
different responses. This lack of a commonly agreed upon nanotechnology
lexicon makes regulation difficult]{.underline}. [Another roadblock
arises because nanotechnology is still an emerging technology. When
establishing regulation, the regulating entity and those empowering the
regulation assume that the regulating entity has the knowledge of what
"good behavior" in an industry should be.7 This assumption is somewhat
flawed because predicting the way a new technology will be developed and
adopted is very difficult. Therefore, predicting what "good behavior" in
an industry will look like is also very difficult]{.underline}.8 This
challenge of regulation does not mean regulation should be ignored until
the technology is mature, but rather that it is necessary to implement a
regulatory framework that can both address problems as they arise and
attempt to prevent future problems by exercising foresight into what the
near-term and long-term technological developments may be. [Next, the
properties of engineered nanomaterials make categorization of these
materials difficult under current regulatory definitions]{.underline}.
For example, according to the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI),
at the nanoscale, a particle's properties such as "melting point,
fluorescence, electrical conductivity, magnetic permeability, and
chemical reactivity change as a function size of the size of the
particle."9 Additionally, according to the NNI "nanoscale materials have
far larger surface areas than similar masses of largerscale materials.
As surface area per mass of a material increases, a greater amount of
the material can come into contact with surrounding materials, thus
affecting reactivity."10 These physical properties provide much of the
basis for why the technology has the potential to be revolutionary.
However, according to Beaudrie, Kandlikar, and Satterfield, "not enough
is known about the relationship between nanomaterial physicochemical
characteristics and behavior to anticipate risks. The result is a
serious lack of predictive analytical capacity to anticipate harmful
implications."11 [Also problematic is that nanotechnology research and
development encompass many different fields of science and across
several sectors of society]{.underline}. These sectors include: energy,
electronics, defense/homeland security, chemicals,
communications/information technology, manufacturing, government, food
and agriculture, pharmaceutical/health companies, transportation,
education, and commerce/economics. [This broad range of potential
application blurs the lines of regulatory responsibility across
different regulatory agencies.]{.underline} Also, each of these sectors
contains stakeholders who have differing concerns and interests in the
technology and are often competing with one another for the funding of
research and development.

[A possibly]{.underline} **[imminent]{.underline}** [tipping point could
be in the form of 'an]{.underline} **[abrupt ice sheet

are]{.underline} **[many avenues]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[positive feedback]{.underline}** in global warming,
[including:]{.underline}

[Though there are also avenues for]{.underline}
**[negative]{.underline}** [feedback, the]{.underline} **[scientific
consensus]{.underline}** [is for an]{.underline} **[overall net positive
feedback]{.underline}** (Roe and Baker, 2007). [Thus]{.underline}, the
Global Challenges Foundation (2017, p. 25) concludes, '[The world is
currently]{.underline} **[completely unprepared]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} envisage, and even less **[deal with]{.underline}**,
the consequences of **[CCC']{.underline}**.

[The threat of sea-level rising from global warming is well known, but
there are also other likely and more imminent threats to the
survivability of mankind and other living things. For
example]{.underline}, Sherwood and Huber (2010) emphasize
[the]{.underline} **[adaptability limit]{.underline}** [to climate
change due to]{.underline} **[heat stress]{.underline}** [from high
environmental wet-bulb temperature.]{.underline} They show that
['even]{.underline} **[modest]{.underline}** global
**[warming]{.underline}** [could \... expose large fractions of
the]{.underline} \[world\] [population to]{.underline} **[unprecedented
heat stress']{.underline}** p. 9552 and that [with substantial global
warming, 'the area of land rendered **uninhabitable by heat stress**

**[sea level']{.underline}** p. 9555, [making]{.underline} **[extinction
much more likely]{.underline}** and the relatively moderate damages
estimated by most integrated assessment models unreliably low.

[While]{.underline} **[imminent]{.underline}** [extinction
is]{.underline} very [unlikely]{.underline} and may not come for a long
time even under business as usual, the main point is that
[we]{.underline} **[cannot rule it out]{.underline}**. Annan and
Hargreaves (2011, pp. 434--435) may be right that [there is 'an upper 95
per cent probability limit for S \[temperature increase\] \... to lie
close to 4°C, and certainly well below 6°C'. However, probabilities of 5
per cent, 0.5 per cent, 0.05 per cent or even 0.005 per cent of
excessive warming and the resulting extinction probabilities **cannot be
ruled out**]{.underline} [and are]{.underline} [**unacceptable**. Even
if there is only a]{.underline} **[1 per cent probability]{.underline}**
[that there is a]{.underline} time **[bomb in the]{.underline}**
air[**plane**, you]{.underline} [**probably want to change your
flight**. **Extinction of the whole world is more important to avoid by

[Climate change has a **long history** of **disrupting civilizations**
and]{.underline} sometimes [precipitating the **collapse of
cultures**]{.underline} or mass emigrations (McMichael, 2017). For
example, [the **12th century drought**]{.underline} in the North
American Southwest [is]{.underline} held [responsible for the collapse
of the **Anasazi pueblo culture**]{.underline}. More recently, [the
**infamous potato famine**]{.underline} of 1846-1849 [and]{.underline}
the [large **migration of Irish** to the US can be **traced**
to]{.underline} a combination of factors, one of which was
[climate]{.underline}. Specifically, 1846 was an unusually warm and
moist year in Ireland, providing the climatic conditions favorable to
the fungus that caused the potato blight. As is so often the case, poor
government had a role as well---as the British government forbade the
import of grains from outside Britain (imports that could have helped to
redress the ravaged potato yields).

**[Climate change]{.underline}** intersects with freshwater resources
because it [is expected to exacerbate **drought** and **water
scarcity**, as well as **flooding**. Climate change]{.underline} can
even [**impair water quality** because]{.underline} it is associated
with [heavy rains]{.underline} that [overwhelm **sewage treatment
facilities**]{.underline}, or because [it results in higher
concentrations of pollutants]{.underline} in groundwater [as a result of
enhanced evaporation and reduced groundwater recharge. **Ample clean
water** is]{.underline} not a luxury - it is [**essential** for **human
survival**]{.underline}. Consequently, cities, regions and [nations that
lack clean freshwater are vulnerable to **social disruption** and
**disease**]{.underline}.

Finally, [**ocean acidification** is linked to climate change because it
is driven by **CO2 emissions**]{.underline} just as global warming is.
[With]{.underline} close to [**20%** of]{.underline} the [**world\'s
protein** coming from oceans]{.underline} (FAO, 2016), [the
potential]{.underline} for [**severe impacts** due to acidification is
**obvious**]{.underline}. Less obvious, but perhaps more insidious, is
the interaction between climate change and the loss of oyster and coral
reefs due to acidification. [Acidification]{.underline} is known to
[interfere with oyster **reef building** and **coral
reefs**]{.underline}. Climate change also increases storm frequency and
severity. Coral reefs and oyster reefs provide protection from storm
surge because they reduce wave energy (Spalding et al., 2014).
[If]{.underline} these [reefs are lost due to acidification]{.underline}
at the same time [as **storms** become more severe and **sea level
rises**]{.underline}, [coastal communities will be exposed to
**unprecedented storm surge**---and may be **ravaged** by recurrent
storms]{.underline}.

A key feature of the risk associated with climate change is that mean
annual temperature and mean annual rainfall are not the variables of
interest. Rather it is **[extreme episodic events]{.underline}** that
[place **nations** and **entire regions** of the world at
risk]{.underline}. These extreme events are by definition \"rare\" (once
every hundred years), and changes in their likelihood are challenging to
detect because of their rarity, but are exactly the manifestations of
climate change that we must get better at anticipating (Diffenbaugh et
al., 2017). Society will have a hard time responding to shorter
intervals between rare extreme events because in the lifespan of an
individual human, a person might experience as few as two or three
extreme events. How likely is it that you would notice a change in the
interval between events that are separated by decades, especially given
that the interval is not regular but varies stochastically? A concrete
example of this dilemma can be found in the past and expected future
changes in storm-related flooding of New York City. The highly
disruptive flooding of New York City associated with Hurricane Sandy
represented a flood height that occurred once every 500 years in the
18th century, and that occurs now once every 25 years, but is expected
to occur once every 5 years by 2050 (Garner et al, 2017). This change in
frequency of extreme floods has profound implications for the measures
New York City should take to protect its infrastructure and its
population, yet because of the stochastic nature of such events, this
shift in flood frequency is an elevated risk that will go unnoticed by
most people.

4\. [The combination of **positive feedback loops** and **societal
inertia** is fertile ground for **global environmental
catastrophes**]{.underline}

[Humans]{.underline} are remarkably ingenious, and [**have adapted** to
crises throughout]{.underline} their [history]{.underline}. Our [doom
has been repeatedly]{.underline} predicted, only to be **[averted by
innovation]{.underline}** (Ridley, 2011). **[However]{.underline}**, the
many [stories of human ingenuity successfully addressing **existential
risks** such as **global famine** or **extreme air pollution**
represent]{.underline} environmental [challenges that are]{.underline}
largely **[linear]{.underline}**, have immediate consequences, [and
operate **without positive feedbacks**]{.underline}. For example, the
fact that food is in short supply does not increase the rate at which
humans consume food---thereby increasing the shortage. Similarly,
massive air pollution episodes such as the London fog of 1952 that
killed 12,000 people did not make future air pollution events more
likely. In fact it was just the opposite---the London fog sent such a
clear message that Britain quickly enacted pollution control measures
(Stradling, 2016). Food shortages, air pollution, water pollution, etc.
send immediate signals to society of harm, which then trigger a negative
feedback of society seeking to reduce the harm.

[In contrast]{.underline}, today\'s great environmental crisis of
climate change may cause some harm but [there are]{.underline} generally
[**long time delays** between rising **CO2 concentrations** and **damage
to humans**. The consequence of]{.underline} these [delays are an
**absence of urgency**]{.underline}; thus although 70% of Americans
believe global warming is happening, only 40% think it will harm them
(http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2016/).
Secondly, unlike past environmental challenges, the earth\'s
[climate]{.underline} system [is rife with **positive feedback
loops**]{.underline}. In particular, [as CO2 increases]{.underline} and
the climate warms, that very [warming can cause more CO2 release which
further increases global warming, and then more CO2, and so
on]{.underline}. Table 2 summarizes the best documented positive
feedback loops for the Earth\'s climate system. These feedbacks can be
neatly categorized into carbon cycle, biogeochemical, biogeophysical,
cloud, ice-albedo, and water vapor feedbacks. As important as it is to
understand these feedbacks individually, it is even more essential to
study the interactive nature of these feedbacks. [**Modeling studies**
show]{.underline} that [when]{.underline} interactions among [feedback
loops are included]{.underline}, uncertainty increases dramatically and
[there is a **heightened potential** for **perturbations to be
magnified**]{.underline} (e.g., Cox et al., 2000; Hajima et al., 2014;
Knutti & Rugenstein, 2015; Rosenfeld et al., 2014). This produces a wide
range of future scenarios.

Positive feedbacks in the carbon cycle involves the enhancement of
future carbon contributions to the atmosphere due to some initial
increase in atmospheric CO2. This happens because [as **CO2
accumulates**, it reduces the efficiency in which]{.underline} oceans
and terrestrial [**ecosystems sequester** carbon, which]{.underline} in
return [**feeds back** to exacerbate **climate change**]{.underline}
(Friedlingstein et al., 2001). [Warming]{.underline} can also
[increase]{.underline} the [rate at which **organic matter decays** and
**carbon is released** into the atmosphere]{.underline}, thereby
[causing more warning]{.underline} (Melillo et al, 2017). [Increases in
**food shortages** and **lack of water**]{.underline} is also of major
concern when biogeophysical feedback mechanisms [perpetuate **drought
conditions**]{.underline}. The underlying mechanism here is that [losses
in **vegetation** increases]{.underline} the [surface albedo, which
**suppresses rainfall**, and]{.underline} thus [enhances]{.underline}
future [**vegetation loss** and more suppression of
rainfall]{.underline}---thereby initiating or prolonging a drought
(Chamey et al., 1975). To top it off, [**overgrazing** depletes the
soil, leading to augmented vegetation loss]{.underline} (Anderies et
al., 2002).

[Climate change]{.underline} often also [increases the risk of **forest
fires**, as a result of higher temperatures and persistent
drought]{.underline} conditions. The expectation is that forest fires
will become more frequent and severe with climate warming and drought
(Scholze et al., 2006), a trend for which we have already seen evidence
(Allen et al., 2010). Tragically, the increased severity and risk of
Southern California wildfires recently predicted by climate scientists
(Jin et al, 2015), was realized in December 2017, with the largest fire
in the history of California (the \"Thomas fire\" that burned 282,000
acres,
https://www.vox.com/2017/12/27/16822180/thomas-fire-california-largest-wildfire
). This catastrophic fire [embodies]{.underline} the sorts of
**[positive feedbacks]{.underline}** and interacting factors [that could
**catch humanity off-guard** and produce a true **apocalyptic
event**]{.underline}. Record-breaking rains produced an extraordinary
flush of new vegetation, that then dried out as record heat waves and
dry conditions took hold, coupled with stronger than normal winds, and
ignition. Of course the record-fire released CO2 into the atmosphere,
thereby contributing to future warming.

Out of all types of feedbacks, [**water vapor** and the **ice-albedo
feedbacks**]{.underline} are the most clearly understood mechanisms.
[Losses in **reflective snow and ice**]{.underline} cover [drive up
**surface temperatures**, leading to **even more melting**]{.underline}
of snow and ice cover---this is known as the ice-albedo feedback (Curry
et al., 1995). As snow and ice continue to melt at a more rapid pace,
millions of people may be displaced by flooding risks as a consequence
of sea level rise near coastal communities (Biermann & Boas, 2010;
Myers, 2002; Nicholls et al., 2011). The water vapor feedback operates
when [warmer atmospheric conditions **strengthen the saturation vapor
pressure**, which creates a warming effect given **water vapor\'s**
strong **greenhouse gas properties**]{.underline} (Manabe & Wetherald,
1967).

Global warming tends to increase cloud formation because warmer
temperatures lead to more evaporation of water into the atmosphere, and
warmer temperature also allows the atmosphere to hold more water. The
key question is whether this increase in clouds associated with global
warming will result in a positive feedback loop (more warming) or a
negative feedback loop (less warming). For decades, scientists have
sought to answer this question and understand the net role clouds play
in future climate projections (Schneider et al., 2017). Clouds are
complex because they both have a cooling (reflecting incoming solar
radiation) and warming (absorbing incoming solar radiation) effect
(Lashof et al., 1997). The type of cloud, altitude, and optical
properties combine to determine how these countervailing effects balance
out. Although still under debate, it appears that in most circumstances
the cloud feedback is likely positive (Boucher et al., 2013). For
example, models and observations show that increasing greenhouse gas
concentrations reduces the low-level cloud fraction in the Northeast
Pacific at decadal time scales. This then has a positive feedback effect
and enhances climate warming since less solar radiation is reflected by
the atmosphere (Clement et al., 2009).

The key lesson from the long list of potentially positive feedbacks and
their interactions is that runaway climate change, and runaway
perturbations have to be taken as a serious possibility. Table 2 is just
a snapshot of the type of feedbacks that have been identified (see
Supplementary Material for a more thorough explanation of positive
feedback loops). However, [this list is **not exhaustive**
and]{.underline} the possibility of [**undiscovered positive feedbacks**
portends even greater **existential risks**]{.underline}. The many
environmental crises humankind has previously averted (famine, ozone
depletion, London fog, water pollution, etc.) were averted because of
political will based on solid scientific understanding. We cannot count
on complete scientific understanding when it comes to positive feedback
loops and climate change.

5\. It is multiplicative stresses (or \"**[double
whammies]{.underline}**\") that [should be our **greatest
concern**]{.underline}

It is easy to see how positive feedback loops exacerbate existential
risks. A second, but less obvious danger is the linkage of seemingly
unrelated processes or phenomenon that increase risk. A good example is
wildfires and tornadoes. Both of these represent natural disasters that
can cause great damage. Until recently no one linked these two
phenomena, and no one would have imagined that an increase in wildfires
might cause an increase in tornados. However, researchers in 2016
documented a linkage between wildfires in Central America and the worst
episode of tornadoes in North America\'s recorded history (Saide et al.,
2016)---more than 120 twisters in one day, which killed 316 people. The
mechanism is that the aerosol particles produced by wildfires increase
the vertical sheer in atmospheric wind speeds, which in turn makes
tornadoes more likely and more severe.

While tornadoes and wildfires are both local there are other trends that
are national or even global that entail interacting risks factors---or
what the renowned ecologist Robert T. Paine called a \"double whammy\"
(Paine, 1993). Paine makes the argument that whereas one perturbation or
stress on its own might not be terribly worrisome, [if an ecosystem is
hit with **two stresses**]{.underline} or threats [at the **same
time**]{.underline} (or in quick succession) [the result can be
**surprisingly catastrophic**]{.underline}. For example, [aging
infrastructure]{.underline} in the United States (dams, bridges, levees,
etc.) [is]{.underline} often talked about as [a disaster waiting to
happen]{.underline} (Reid, 2008). Similarly, [increased extreme rainfall
is]{.underline} widely appreciated as [a likely outcome of climate
change]{.underline}. Putting the two [together, we have a recipe
for]{.underline} turning improbable events into something that should be
expected. A specific example of what was once a highly unlikely
**[tragedy]{.underline}**, but is now perhaps a probable disaster is the
failure of a large dam. If large aging dams fail due to the combination
of decaying infrastructure and unprecedented rainfall, downstream
communities could be destroyed. Existing dams were engineered for flood
frequencies and rainfall regimes that have been replaced by much more
extreme weather events. This should raise general concerns about
flood-safety. Not only are the designs for major dams obsolete due to
climate changes, the dams themselves are obsolete. In the United States
alone, more than 85% of large dams will be more than 50 years old by
2020 (Hossain et al., 2009). Based on data from the National Performance
of Dam Failures, the top ten causes of dam incidents in the United
States are depicted in Fig. 2a. The most frequent type of incident was
attributed to inflow floods---that is more than 1000 dam failures. The
reason this is a global concern is that observations (Fig. 2b) in dry
and wet regions all over the world show that extreme precipitation
events have been increasing since the 1950s (Donat et al., 2017). [The
**combined effect** of **intensified rainfall** and **old dams** pose a
**clear risk** to communities worldwide]{.underline}.

California, which has used dams and reservoirs to store water on a
massive scale, recently suffered through several consecutive years of
both low rainfall and high temperatures that produced a 5-year
record-breaking drought (Diffenbaugh et al., 2015). The drought ended
when the state experienced massive amounts of precipitation in early
2017 leading to its wettest rainy season, on record (Vahedifard et al.,
2017). The rainfall unleashed floods, landslides, and nearly collapsed
the Oroville Dam, the tallest dam in North America. The tremendous water
flows severely damaged the dam\'s spillways, prompting the evacuation of
about 190,000 people downriver of the dam (Park & Mclaughlin, 2017).
This particular crisis is an example of how [the intersection of
**climate change** and **infrastructure** that is]{.underline} either
**[aging]{.underline}** or that was designed for different conditions
[can potentially lead to a **catastrophe**]{.underline} (Vahedifard et
al., 2017). With the likelihood of more frequent extreme events in the
future, situations like the one experienced at the Oroville Dam will
become more common.

The intersection of climate change and human activity is also elevating
the risk of severe wildfires in large portions of the world. Models
suggest that precipitation was the primary driver behind global fire
regimes during the preindustrial era, and then shifted towards an
anthropogenic-driven regime during the industrial period (Pechony &
Shindell, 2010). Now it appears that **[temperature]{.underline}** will
[play a **strong role** in]{.underline} the 21st century in **[global
wildfires]{.underline}** (Pechony & Shindell, 2010). The combination of
[increasing temperatures at the global scale]{.underline} with increased
propensity of wildfires due to human activity at the local level, [could
lead to **massive infernos**]{.underline} (Bonan, 2008). Wildfire
severity and frequency will be dramatically increased wherever the mean
temperature in a region increases by 3°C or more; unfortunately, in the
Sahel, central Australia, central Asia, southern Africa, the western
U.S., and in most of South America, warming is indeed expected to exceed
3°C (Scholze et al., 2006). [This is a **global threat**]{.underline}.

The scale of the Anthropocene and the speed of the Great Acceleration
pose a fundamental dilemma spotted by the German philosopher Gunther
Anders early in the atomic age. For nearly all of history, our abilities
to imagine (vorstellen) outstripped our abilities to produce
(her-stellen). We could dream big, but we lacked the energy to build
big. Now, things are inverted. Our productive powers exceed our
imaginative ones. We are making a world that we cannot comprehend. The
scholar Timothy Morton (2013) puts this in terms of \'hyperobjects,\'
phenomena that are so massively distributed across time and space as to
confound our usual way of making sense of things.

Climate change is the prime example. It is there in the flood or the
wildfire, but it is also not there. We can neither escape it nor keep
our attention trained on it. Despite billions of dollars of scientific
research, [we have]{.underline} still [**never**
experienced]{.underline} or felt [the climate]{.underline}. What [we
experience]{.underline} is **[weather]{.underline}**, and it\'s always
changing, [so what\'s the big deal?]{.underline} That might explain why
fossil fuels remain at around 80% of the world\'s energy mix---the same
as it was back in 1987 (Harder 2019). The global economy hasn\'t
decarbonized any faster during the era of climate science than it did in
the two decades prior to all that knowledge (Pielke 2019).

Are we even capable of grasping what we are doing? As Nietzsche asked in
his parable of the madman from The Gay Science, \"Is not the greatness
of this deed too great for us?\" (1882, para. 125).

Climate change is everywhere and nowhere. It is now, but it can\'t be
now because the now is the time of weather. After Hurricane Dorian
devastated the Bahamas in 2019, the homeless survivors looked like
victims of bad weather rather than climate. You can see how
[we]{.underline} might [react to **a climate apocalypse** like
the]{.underline} proverbial [frog in]{.underline} the
[boiling]{.underline} pot of [water **comfortably slipping** into
**oblivion**]{.underline}.

Before he was forced to flee Nazi Germany in 1933, Anders married the
political thinker (and fellow student of Martin Heidegger) Hannah
Arendt. In her 1958 book The Human Condition, Arendt worried that we may
soon no longer be able to \"understand, that is to think and speak about
the things which nevertheless we are able to do.\"

Hans Jonas (1984), another student of Heidegger\'s and a lifetime friend
of Arendt, argued that all previous ethics could assume \"that the range
of human action and therefore responsibility was narrowly
circumscribed.\" Our high-energy machines have altered the scale of our
action and since ethics has to do with action, [**our ethics** must
change]{.underline}. But we may simply not be wired for this. [If you
strap someone into a]{.underline} functional magnetic resonance imaging
machine (**[fMRI]{.underline}**) and watch [as they think about
themselves, their]{.underline} medial [**prefrontal cortex** lights
up]{.underline}. We care deeply about ourselves. [The lights get
**dimmer**]{.underline} and dimmer [as we think about people **further
removed**]{.underline} from this central ego---family, friends, and
acquaintances (see Walsh 2019). Thinking about [**a stranger** in the
Bahamas who lost their home **hardly** creates **any spark at
all**]{.underline}.

[It\'s not just **spatial scales** that challenge our **moral
psychology**. It\'s also **time**. The **prefrontal
cortex**]{.underline} even [**dims** when you think about]{.underline}
yourself in [the future]{.underline}. As economists know, [we **discount
the near future**, which means it is worth less. The **far future** is
**entirely worthless**]{.underline}, but of course what we call the
\"far future\" is no time at all for the planet. There\'s the problem:
we are geological agents unable to think geologically. Time and space
are slipping from our grasp. This is why \"global weirding\" is a good
term for what is happening.

Anders (1957) wrote that your first thought upon waking up in the
morning should be \'Atom.\' You should call to mind the enormous powers
pulsing under the seemingly steady day-to-day world. \"For you should
not begin your day,\" he continued, \"with the illusion that what
surrounds you is a stable world.\" Your second thought should be: \"The
possibility of the Apocalypse is our work. But we know not what we are
doing.\" Even the experts are ignorant when it comes to the whole. We
cannot \"realize the reality which we can bring into being.\" There is a
gap between our actions and our imagination. Weird things are falling
through the crack.

What was a gap in the time of Arendt and Anders is now a chasm. We have
altered the energy balance of the entire planet. Now our first thought
on waking in the morning should be CARBON, because the extra energy
trapped in the ribbon-thin atmosphere from greenhouse gas emissions is
equivalent to that released by 400,000 nuclear bombs exploding every day
(Hansen 2012). We are proving that Heraclitus was right with his
original philosophy of energy: all is fire.

\* \* \*

The challenge facing us is unlike any other in human history: We have to
fathom the world that we are making. The understanding that we require
is not just scientific or technological, and the \'energy\' we have to
fathom is not just the stuff stored in chemical bonds, flowing through
pipelines, or buzzing across wires. The energy transition that caused
the Anthropocene is not just the one to nuclear power and fossil fuels.
Something deeper happened over the last few hundred years. There was a
revaluation of values, a transition from a world of virtues to a world
of volts. As a result, the metabolic energies of human labor and
consumption became unhinged and we started eating the planet.

Living organisms constantly wrest themselves from non-self. They pull in
air and nourishment for their metabolic fires. The basic energies of
life are labor and consumption (which are two stages of the same
process), and they are incessant. I will feel the pangs of hunger
tonight even though I just ate lunch. It will come again in the morning
and for the rest of my life. The caloric demands of the consuming and
laboring body cease only upon death. But this incessant activity, Arendt
argued, is one that spins round and round a wheel and in that sense it
\"remained stationary\" for all of human history. All along the long
shaft of the hockey stick, human energy was \"imprisoned in the eternal
recurrence of the life process to which it was tied\" (Arendt 1958, p.
46).

The jutting blade of the hockey stick, the Great Acceleration, is the
rupturing of the chains that had kept this incessant life process
spinning cyclically. Labor and consumption were taken from the dark
interior of the private realm and admitted into the public realm. The
household economy became the global economy. Labor, Arendt notes, has
become liberated \"from its circular, monotonous recurrence and
transformed\...into a swiftly progressing development whose results have
in a few centuries totally changed the whole inhabited world\" (p. 47).
As Nietzsche put it, we lost all sense of limit or measure and embraced
\"the thrill of the infinite.\" We went from a world of virtues to a
world of volts.

Arendt thought that this was a paradox. She called it \"the unnatural
growth of the natural,\" because the natural metabolic energy
transformations were unleashed beyond all natural boundaries. We call
this economic growth. Just as I need to feed my own metabolic fire with
lunch, we need to feed this global metabolic fire. The difference is,
though, that my body only grows to a point and then stops. The
collective body of the Anthropocene keeps growing beyond all proportion
and measure. There is no limit, no sense of sufficiency.

Can this continue? As I was writing this book, [**climate change**
morphed into the **climate crisis**]{.underline}. [Greenland experienced
a **record ice melt**]{.underline}. There were [**record heat waves** in
Europe]{.underline}, and [**unprecedented fires and floods** around the
world]{.underline}. The hockey stick blades kept reaching alarming new
highs. Despite climate treaties, global CO2 emissions kept going up. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world\'s most
respected source of climate science, issued new studies with grim news
about the impact of the human economy on planet Earth. Saying that they
have a \"moral obligation\" to \"tell it like it is,\" over 11,000
scientists broke with the more conservative rhetoric of [the
**IPCC**]{.underline} and [issued a statement proclaiming]{.underline}
that [\"Earth is facing **a climate emergency**\"]{.underline} (Ripple
et al. 2019). Prominent voices warned that [the Earth may **soon** be
**uninhabitable**]{.underline} (Wallace-Wells 2019) and that [the human
game may be **playing itself out**]{.underline} (McKibben 2019).

https://www.thirdway.org/op-ed/3-reasons-for-hope-in-the-ipccs-new-climate-report

#1 [We're **Not Too Late**...Yet]{.underline}

The report states that "[past emissions alone are unlikely to raise
\[global mean surface temperature\] to 1.5°C above pre-industrial
levels." This means it is **not inevitable** that we will hit 1.5°C
warming due to our past emissions]{.underline}.

[There is **still an opportunity**, albeit a short one, to
change]{.underline} our priorities and [policies, commit to drastically
reducing]{.underline} our [emissions, and **prevent** a level of global
warming that will cause irreversible and devastating impacts on people
and the planet]{.underline}.

[But]{.underline} don't mistake this bit of good news as a justification
to take a breather or confirmation that we are doing well enough
already. The report also explains, "[If emissions continue at their
present rate]{.underline}, human-induced [warming will exceed 1.5°C by
around 2040." We are definitely not on track, but the **evidence shows**
we **still have time** to remedy that]{.underline}.

#2 We Can Fight Climate Change By Becoming More Resilient

To halt global warming, we ultimately need to reduce the amount of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But we can also fight back by making
ourselves more resilient to the impacts of climate change, thereby
reducing the toll it takes on people and the global economy. More than
previous IPCC reports, this one makes it clear that resiliency solutions
are climate change solutions, adding even more tools to our toolbox to
help us fix this problem.

Poor and disadvantaged communities are the most impacted by climate
change, bearing the brunt of the consequences for our global actions. By
steering a relatively small percentage of our overall climate efforts
toward lifting these people out of poverty and providing more economic
and social opportunity, we can drastically lessen the damage from
climate change.

[Becoming **more resilient** is a **proactive approach** to protecting
communities while tackling emissions reductions
simultaneously\--basically allowing us to attack climate change on **two
flanks**]{.underline}.

#3 We are Capable of Making Rapid Transitions

The report explains that [we need to make sweeping, global
changes]{.underline} at a rate that has "no documented historic
precedent" in order to stay below 1.5°C. [But]{.underline} it also
reminds us that [we **have made** transitions this rapid]{.underline}
"within specific sectors, technologies, and spatial contexts." These
[examples of smaller, successful transitions offer **reason for
hope**]{.underline}\--that we could replicate and build upon them, again
and again, across the globe, in order to see large-scale change. [So
it's not a matter of "can we?", but "will we?".]{.underline}

Already, we've seen significant innovation in technologies to produce
zero-carbon energy and even remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere;
both of which are highlighted as critical components of 1.5°C strategy.
In fact, rapid transitions with wind, solar, and electricity storage
suggest a larger "system transition in electricity generation may be
underway." Advancements in other low- and zero-carbon energy sources,
including nuclear, geothermal, and carbon capture, could provide further
crucial emissions reductions for the energy sector.

[A rapid transition to a low-carbon world is challenging, but we **can
achieve it** if we commit to doing so]{.underline}.

acutely by those groups in society who already experience

[represents a significant stress factor with the potential to compound

#### Allowing warming to continue perpetuates racist inequalities

Everywhere we turn, the issues and impacts of climate change confront
us. One of the most serious environmental threats facing the world
today, climate change has moved from the minds of scientists and offices
of environmentalists to the mainstream. Though the media is dominated by
images of polar bears, melting glaciers, flooded lands, and arid
desserts, there is a human face to this story as well. [Climate
change]{.underline} is not only an issue of the environment; it
[is]{.underline} also [an issue of justice and human rights, one that
dangerously intersects **race and class**. All over the world people of
color, Indigenous Peoples and low-income communities bear
**disproportionate burdens** from climate change]{.underline} itself,
from ill-designed policies to prevent it, and from side effects of the
energy systems that cause it. A Climate of Change explores the impacts
of climate change on African Americans, from health to economics to
community, and considers what policies would most harm or benefit
African Americans---and the nation as a whole. African Americans are
thirteen percent of the U.S. population and on average emit nearly
twenty percent less greenhouse gases than non-Hispanic whites per
capita. [Though far less responsible for climate change, African
Americans are significantly more vulnerable to its effects]{.underline}
than non- Hispanic whites. [Health, housing, economic well-being,
culture, and social stability are harmed from such manifestations of
climate change as storms, floods, and climate variability. African
Americans are also more vulnerable to higher energy bills, unemployment,
recessions caused by]{.underline} global [energy]{.underline} price
[shocks]{.underline}, and a greater economic burden from military
operations designed to protect the flow of oil to the U.S.

Climate Justice: The Time Is Now

Ultimately, accomplishing climate justice will require that new
alliances are forged and traditional movements are transformed. An
effective policy to address the challenges of global warming cannot be
crafted until race and equity are part of the discussion from the outset
and an integral part of the solution. This report finds that: Global
**[warming amplifies nearly all existing inequalities]{.underline}**.
Under global warming, injustices that are already unsustainable become
catastrophic. Thus it is essential to recognize that all justice is
climate justice and that the struggle for racial and economic justice is
an unavoidable part of the fight to halt global warming. [Sound global
warming policy is also economic and racial justice policy]{.underline}.
Successfully adopting a [sound global warming policy will]{.underline}
do as much to [strengthen the economies of low-income communities and
communities of color]{.underline} as any other currently plausible
stride toward economic justice. Climate policies that best serve African
Americans also best serve a just and strong United States. This paper
shows that policies well-designed to benefit African Americans also
provide the most benefit to all people in the U.S. [Climate policies
that best serve]{.underline} African Americans and other
[disproportionately affected communities also best serve global economic
and environmental justice. Domestic reductions]{.underline} in global
warming pollution and support for such reductions in developing nations
financed by polluter-pays principles [provide the greatest benefit to
African Americans]{.underline}, [the peoples of Africa, and people
across the Global South]{.underline}. A distinctive African American
voice is critical for climate justice. Currently, legislation is being
drafted, proposed, and considered without any significant input from the
communities most affected. Special interests are represented by powerful
lobbies, while traditional environmentalists often fail to engage people
of color, Indigenous Peoples, and low-income communities until after the
political playing field has been defined and limited to conventional
environmental goals. A strong focus on equity is essential to the
success of the environmental cause, but equity issues cannot be
adequately addressed by isolating the voices of communities that are
disproportionately impacted. Engagement in climate change policy must be
moved from the White House and the halls of Congress to social circles,
classrooms, kitchens, and congregations. The time is now for those
disproportionately affected to assume leadership in the climate change
debate, to speak truth to power, and to assert rights to social,
environmental and economic justice. Taken together, these actions affirm
a vital truth that will bring communities together: Climate Justice is
Common Justice. African Americans and Vulnerability In this report, it
is shown that African Americans are disproportionately affected by
climate change. African Americans Are at Greater Risk from Climate
Change and Global Warming Co-Pollutants

the]{.underline} **[death]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} up to **[90%
of the]{.underline}** American **[population]{.underline}** \[1\].

There is no published model disclosing how these numbers were arrived
at, nor are we able to validate a primary source for this claim.
Testimony given by the Chairman of the Congressional EMP Commission,
while expressing similar concerns, gave no estimate of the deaths that
would accrue from a prolonged nationwide grid collapse \[2\].

[The power grid is]{.underline} posited to be [vulnerable
to]{.underline} geomagnetic storms generated by solar activity,
electromagnetic pulses (EMP, also referred to as HEMP) produced by high
altitude nuclear detonations, [**cyber**attack]{.underline}, and kinetic
(physical) attack. Evidence for and against the validity of each of
these threats follows below. Much of the knowledge on these matters is
classified. The studies for and against EMP, other than for limited
testing of a few components of the infrastructure by the EMP commission,
are based not on physical demonstrations but mathematical models and
simulations. Moreover, the underlying physics and technology
involved---the electrical engineering and materials science---is likely
beyond the understanding of the reader, and certainly beyond that of
these writers. With these limitations in mind, we proceed.

The electrical grid

HV (high voltage) transformers---transmitting voltages of greater than
100 kV---are what make it possible to send electricity over great
distances to thousands of substations, where smaller transformers reduce
the voltage.

**[HV]{.underline}** [transformers are the]{.underline} **[weak
link]{.underline}** in the system, [and]{.underline} the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission ([FERC]{.underline}) [has identified]{.underline}
**[30]{.underline}** of these [as]{.underline} **[being]{.underline}**
critical. [The simultaneous loss of **just 9**]{.underline}, in various
combinations, [could]{.underline} cripple the network and [lead to
a]{.underline} [**cascading failure**, resulting in a]{.underline}
**["coast-to coast blackout"]{.underline}** \[3\].

[If the]{.underline} HV [transformers are]{.underline} **[irreparably
damaged]{.underline}** [it is]{.underline} **[problematic]{.underline}**
[whether they can be]{.underline} [**replaced**. The]{.underline}
**[great majority]{.underline}** of these units [are]{.underline}
[**custom built**. The lead time between]{.underline} **[order and
delivery]{.underline}** for a domestically manufactured HV transformer
[is]{.underline} between 12 and **[24 months]{.underline}** \[4\], and
this is [under]{.underline} **[benign, low demand
conditions]{.underline}**.

The first practical application of the transformer was invented in the
USA by William Stanley, but largely as a consequence of American trade
policy ("It doesn't make any difference whether a country makes potato
chips or computer chips"- attributed to Michael Boskin, Chairman of
President George H W Bush's Council of Economic Advisors) \[5\] there is
little manufacturing capability remaining in the USA. Worldwide
production is less than 100 per year and serves the rapidly growing
markets of China and India. Only Germany and South Korea produce for
export.

[Ordered]{.underline} [**today**, delivery of a unit from]{.underline}
**[overseas]{.underline}** (responsible for 85% of current American
purchasing) [would take]{.underline} nearly **[3 years]{.underline}**
\[6\]. [The factory price for an HV transformer can be in excess of \$10
million---too expensive to maintain an]{.underline}
**[inventory]{.underline}** [solely as **spares**]{.underline}
[for]{.underline} **[emergency]{.underline}** replacement.

Potential mechanisms of collapse

Geomagnetic storms

Geomagnetic storms are due to coronal mass ejections (CMEs)---massive
eruptions of plasma expelled from the sun's corona. Plasma is the fourth
fundamental state of matter, consisting of free electrons and positively
charged ions. The sun, like all stars, is plasma.

Coronal mass ejections often occur with solar flares, but each can also
take place in the absence of the other. The latter emits radiation in
all bands of the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., white light,
ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma rays) and unlike CMEs, affect
little more than radio communications.

CME's take several days to reach the Earth. The radiation generated by
solar flares on the other hand arrives in 8 min.

Coronal mass ejections carry an intense magnetic field. If a storm
enters the earth's magnetosphere, it causes rapid changes in the
configuration of the earth's magnetic field. Electric current is
generated in the magnetosphere and ionosphere, generating
electromagnetic fields at ground level. The movement of magnetic fields
around a conductor, i.e., a wire or pipe, induces an electric current.
The longer the wire, the greater the amplification. The current induced
is akin to DC (direct current), which the electrical system poorly
tolerates. Our grid is based on AC. The excess current can cause voltage
collapse, or worse, cause permanent damage to large transformers.

The current flowing through HV transformers during a geomagnetic
disturbance can be estimated using storm simulation and transmission
grid data \[7\]. From these results, transformer vulnerability to
internal heating can be assessed.

The largest recorded geomagnetic storm occurred Sept 1--2, 1859---the
Carrington event, named after the English amateur astronomer, Richard
Carrington. Auroras were seen as far south as the Caribbean. Campers in
the Rocky Mountains were awakened shortly after midnight by "an auroral
light so bright that one could easily read common print. Some of the
party insisted it was daylight and began preparation for breakfast"
\[8\]. Telegraph wires transmitted electric shocks to operators and
ignited fires.

In May 1921, there was another great geomagnetic disturbance (GMD), the
railroad storm. The National Academy of Sciences estimates that if that
storm occurred today, it could cause 1--2 trillion dollars damage and
full recovery could take 4--10 years \[9\].

The basis for this assertion is a presentation made by J Kappenman of
Metatech, the Goleta California engineering consulting firm, given as
part of the NAS Space weather workshop titled "Future Solutions,
Vulnerabilities and Risks", on May 23, 2008. The simulation asserts that
a 1921 intensity storm could damage or destroy over 300 transformers in
the US, and leave 130 million people without power \[10\]. Elsewhere,
Kappenman states that in a worst case situation, geomagnetic
disturbances could instantly create loss of over 70% of the nation's
electrical service \[11\].

In March 1989, a geomagnetic storm caused collapse of the power grid in
Quebec, leaving 6 million without power for 9 h. NERC (the North
American Electric Reliability Council), a self-regulated trade
organization formed by the electric utility industry, asserts that the
blackout was not due to overheating of transformers from geomagnetically
induced current, but to the near-simultaneous tripping of seven relays,
and this is correct \[12\]. The rapid voltage collapse (within 93 s)
likely prevented transformer thermal damage. The same storm, however,
destroyed a major transformer at the Salem nuclear plant in New Jersey
\[13\]. The 1989 Hydro-Quebec storm was 1/10th the intensity of the 1921
Railroad Storm \[14\].

A report for Lloyd's in 2013 states [a Carrington-level extreme
**geomagnetic storm**]{.underline} [is]{.underline} almost
**[inevitable]{.underline}** [in the future]{.underline}. Using its own
**[models]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[simulations]{.underline}**, it [puts the US population at risk
at]{.underline} between 20 and [**40 million**, with the outages
lasting]{.underline} up to 1--2 **[years]{.underline}** \[15\].

Because of geography and ground conductivity, the risk of a transformer
sustaining damage is 1000 times greater in some US counties than in
others. The highest risk is to the counties along the corridor between
Washington DC and New York \[16\].

The first written account of a solar storm is possibly in the book of
Joshua. Written reports of aural sightings by Greeks and Romans begin in
371 BC.

A Carrington-level storm narrowly missed the earth in 2012 \[17\]. NASA
has produced a video on the CME \[18\]. Formerly considered a 1 in
100-year event, [the likelihood]{.underline} of a Carrington intensity
storm striking the earth [has]{.underline} most recently [been placed
at]{.underline} **[12% per decade]{.underline}** \[19\].

Mitigation

The EMP Commission, in its 2008 report, found that it is not practical
to try to protect the entire electrical power system or even all
high-value components. It called however for a plan designed to reduce
recovery and restoration times and minimize the net impact of an event
\[20\]. This would be accomplished by "hardening" the grid, i.e.,
actions to protect the nation's electrical system from disruption and
collapse, either natural or man-made \[21\]. The shielding is
accomplished through surge arrestors and similar devices \[22\]. The
cost to harden the grid, from our tabulation of Congressional EMP
figures, is \$3.8 billion.

[There has been]{.underline} **[no hardening]{.underline}** of the grid

The commission and organization that are responsible for public policy
on grid protection are FERC and NERC. FERC (The Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission) is an independent agency within the Department of
Energy. NERC, the self-regulatory agency formed by the electric utility
industry, was renamed the North American Electric Reliability
Corporation in 2006.

In June of 2007, FERC granted NERC the legal authority to enforce
reliability standards for the bulk power system in the USA. FERC cannot
mandate any standards. FERC only has the authority to ask NERC to
propose standards for protecting the grid.

**[NERC's]{.underline}** [position]{.underline} on GMD [is that the
threat is]{.underline} **[exaggerated]{.underline}**.

A report by NERC in 2012 asserts that geomagnetic storms will not cause
widespread destruction of transformers, but only a short-term
(temporary) grid instability \[23\]. The NERC report did not use a model
that was validated against past storms, and their work was not
peer-reviewed.

The NERC report has been criticized by members of the Congressional EMP
commission. Dr. Peter Pry asserts that [the final draft was "written in
**secret** by a]{.underline} **[small group]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} NERC **[employees]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
electric **[utility insiders]{.underline}**..... The report [relied on
meetings of]{.underline} **[industry employees]{.underline}** [in lieu
of data collection or event investigation]{.underline}" \[22\].

NERC, in turn, criticizes Kappenman's work. NERC states that the
Metatech work cannot be independently confirmed \[24\]. NERC reliability
manager Mark Lauby criticized the report for being based on proprietary
code \[24\]. Kappenman's report, however, received no negative comments
in peer review \[24\].

The NERC standards

The reliability standards and operational procedures established by
[NERC]{.underline}, and approved by FERC, are disputed \[25\]. Among the
points are these:

1\. The [standards against GMD do]{.underline} **[not
include]{.underline}** [Carrington storm class levels]{.underline}. The
NERC standards were arrived at studying only the storms of the immediate
prior 30 years, the largest of which was the Quebec storm. The GMD
"benchmark event", i.e., the strongest storm which the system is
expected to withstand, is set by NERC as 8 V/km \[26\]. NERC asserts
this figure defines the upper limit intensity of a 1 in 100-year storm
\[26\]. The Los Alamos National Laboratory, however, puts the intensity
of a Carrington-type event at a median of 13.6 V/km, ranging up to
16.6 V/km \[27\]. Another analysis finds the intensity of a 100-year
storm could be higher than 21 V/km \[28\].

2\. The 15--45 min warning time of a geomagnetic storm provided by space
satellites (ACE and DSCOVR) will be insufficient for operators to
confer, coordinate, and execute actions to prevent grid damage and
collapse.

Testimony of Edison Electric Institute official Scott Aaronson under
questioning by Senator Ron Johnson in a hearing before the Senate
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in 2016
encapsulates some of the issues. Video of the exchange is available on
the web \[29\]. The Edison Electric Institute (EEI) is the trade
association that represents all US investor-owned electric companies.

Johnson: Mr. Aaronson, I just have to ask you -- the protocol of warning
15--30 min -- who is going to make that call? I mean, who is going to
make that for a massive geomagnetic disturbance, that nobody knows how
many of these transformers are going to be affected. Who is going to
make that call to shut them off line -- to take them off line -- so
those effects do not go through those wires and destroy those large
transformers that cannot be replaced?

Aaronson: So, the grid operators are tightly aligned. We talked about
the fact that there are 1900 entities that make up the bulk electric
system. There are transmission operators and so on...

Johnson (interrupting): Who makes the call? Who makes the call -- we are
going to shut them all down in 30 min, in 15 min?

Aaronson: It's not as simple as cutting the power. That's not how this
is going to work but there is again, there is this shared responsibility
among the sector.

Johnson: Who makes the call?

Aaronson: I do not know the answer to that question \[29\].

Mr. Aaronson's is Managing Director for Cyber and Infrastructure
Security at EEI.

Congressman Trent Franks, R Az introduced HR 2417, the SHEILD Act, on
6/18/2013. The bill would give FERC the authority to require owners and
operators of the bulk power system to take measures to protect the grid
from GMD or EMP attack. The costs would be recovered by raising
regulated rates.

Franks states he had been led to believe that his bill would be brought
to the House floor for a vote. But he states House Energy and Commerce
Committee Chairman Fred Upton R, Mich., let it die in committee. He has
been unable to get an explanation from Upton \[30\].

Between 2011 and 2016, Mr. Upton has received \$1,180,000 in campaign
contributions from the electric utility industry \[31\].

The electric utility industry is heavily involved in campaign donations.
During the 2014 federal election cycle, the electric utility industry
made \$21.6 million in campaign contributions \[32\]. The electrical
utility industry is particularly involved in state politics. For
instance, in Florida, between 2004 and 2012 electric utility companies
donated \$18 million into legislative and state political campaigns. In
that state, the electric utilities employ one lobbyist for every two
legislators \[33\].

Electric utility revenue in 2015 was 391 billion dollars \[34\].

Electromagnetic pulse

Of the scenarios that might lead to electrical network collapse, EMP has
received the widest public attention. It has been the subject of
television series, films, and novels. HEMP (for high altitude) is the
more accurate acronym, but as media and the public use EMP, we will use
both interchangeably.

The issue has become highly politicized. The most prominent article in
the media against EMP as a threat is by Patrick Disney, "The Campaign to
Terrify You about EMP" published in the Atlantic in 2011. "From Newt
Gingrich to a Congressional 'EMP Caucus', some conservatives warn the
electronic frying blast could pose gravely underestimated dangers on the
U.S.....Ballistic missile defense seems to be the panacea for this
groups concern, though a generous dose of preemption and war on terror
are often prescribed as well" \[35\].

As of 2009, Mr. Disney was acting Policy Director for the National
Iranian American Council (NIAC). NIAC has been accused of acting as a
lobby for the Islamic Republic of Iran \[36\].

Mr. Disney is quoted as stating his strategy, in advancing an Iranian
interest, is to "create a media controversy" \[36\].

The campaign to discredit EMP has been largely successful. To a very
large part of the body politic EMP is identified as a cause limited to
the far right.

A high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is produced when a nuclear
device is detonated above the atmosphere. No radiation, blast, or shock
wave is felt on the ground, nor are there any adverse health effects,
but electromagnetic fields reach the surface.

An EMP has three components, E1 through E3, defined by speed of the
pulse. Each has specific characteristics, and specific potential effects
on the grid. E1, the first and fastest component, affects primarily
microelectronics. E3, the later and slower component, affects devices
attached to long conductive wires and cables, especially high-voltage
transformers.

[A single]{.underline} **[nuclear blast]{.underline}** [will generate
an]{.underline} **[EMP]{.underline}** [encompassing]{.underline} **[half
the continental USA]{.underline}** \[37\]. **[Two]{.underline}** or
three [explosions]{.underline}, over different areas, [would blanket
the]{.underline} **[entire continent]{.underline}**al USA.

The potential impact of an EMP is determined by the altitude of the
nuclear detonation, the gamma yield of the device, the distance from the
detonation point, the strength and direction of the earth's magnetic
field at locations within the blast zone and the vulnerability of the
infrastructures exposed. The E1 gamma signal is greatest for bursts
between 50 and 100 km altitude. E3 signals are optimized at busts
between 130 and 500 km altitude, much greater heights than for E1
\[38\]. Higher altitude widens the area covered, but at the expense of
field levels. The 1963 atmospheric test ban has prevented further
testing.

E1 and its effects

The E1 pulse ("fast pulse") is due to gamma radiation (photons),
generated by a nuclear detonation at high altitude, colliding with atoms
in the upper atmosphere. The collisions cause electrons to be stripped
from the atoms, with the resultant flow of electrons traveling downward
to earth at near the speed of light. The interaction of the electrons
with the earth's magnetic field turns the flow into a transverse current
that radiates forward as an intense electromagnetic wave. The field
generates extremely high voltages and current in electrical conductors
that can exceed the voltage tolerance of many electronic devices. All
this occurs within a few tens of nanoseconds.

The Congressional EMP Commission postulated that E1 would have its
primary impact on microelectronics, especially SCADAs (Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition), DCSs (digital control systems), and PLCs
(programmable logic controllers). These are the small computers,
numbering now in the millions, that allow for the unmanned operation of
our infrastructure.

To assess the vulnerability of SCADAs to EMP, and therefore the
vulnerability of our infrastructure, [the EMP Commission
funded]{.underline} a series of [**test**s, exposing **SCADA**
components to both radiated electric fields and injected voltages on
cables connected to the components]{.underline}. The intent was to
observe the response of the equipment, when in an operational mode, to
electromagnetic energy simulating an EMP. "The bottom line observation
at the end of the testing was that **[every system tested
failed]{.underline}** [when exposed to the simulated EMP
environment]{.underline}" \[6\].

E1 can generate voltages of 50,000 V. Normal operating voltages of
today's miniaturized electronics tend to be only a few (3-4) volts.
States the EMP Commission: "The large number and widespread reliance on
such systems by all the nation's critical infrastructures represent a
systemic threat to their continued operation following an EMP event"
\[39\]. A scenario seen in films is all automobiles and trucks being
rendered inoperable. This would not be the case. Modern automobiles have
as many as 100 microprocessors that control virtually all functions, but
the vulnerability has been reduced by the increased application of
electromagnetic compatibility standards. The EMP Commission found that
only minor damage occurred at an E1 field level of 50 kV/m, but there
were minor disruptions of normal operations at lower peak levels as well
\[40\].

There is a self-published post (J. Steinberger, Nobel laureate physics,
1988) disputing the potential effects of E1 \[41\]. This is an isolated
opinion.

Shielding against E1 could theoretically be accomplished through the
construction of a Faraday cage around specific components or an entire
facility. The cage is composed of conductive materials and an insulation
barrier that absorbs pulse energy and channels it directly into the
ground. The cage shields out the EM signals by "shorting out" the
electric field and reflecting it.

To be an effective Faraday cage, the conductive case must totally
enclose the system. Any aperture, even microscopic seams between metal
plates, can compromise the protection. To be useful, however, a device
must have some connection with the outside world and not be completely
isolated. Surge protective devices can be used on metallic cables to
prevent large currents from entering a device, or the metallic cables
can be replaced by fiber optic cables without any accompanying metal.
The US Military has taken extensive measures to protect ("harden") its
equipment against E1. "On the civilian side, the problem has not really
been addressed" \[42\].

E3 and its effects

E3 is caused by the motion of ionized bomb debris and atmosphere
relative to the geomagnetic field, resulting in a perturbation of that
field. This induces currents of thousands of amperes in long conductors
such as transmission lines that are several kilometers or greater in
length. Direct currents of hundreds to thousands of amperes will flow
into transformers. As the length of the conductor increases, the
amperage amplifies.

The physics of E3 are similar to that of a GMD, but not identical. GMD
comes from charged particles showering down from space creating current
flow in the ionosphere. These currents create magnetic fields on the
ground. A nuclear burst on the other hand generates particles which
create a magnetic bubble that pushes on the earth's magnetic field
producing a changing magnetic field at the Earth's surface. A
geomagnetic storm will have substorms that can move over the Earth for
more than 1 day, while the E3 HEMP occurs only immediately following a
nuclear burst.

There are three studies on the potential effects of a HEMP E3 on the
power grid.

The first study, published in 1991, found there would be little damage
\[43\]. Although supporting the utility industry's position, it has not
been subsequently cited by either NERC or the industry. The study is
criticized for expressing a smaller threat intensity \[44\]. The second,
published in 2010 by Metatech, calculated that [a nuclear detonation
170 km over the USA would]{.underline} **[collapse]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} **[entire US power grid]{.underline}** \[45\]. The
third study, by EPRI (an organization funded by the electric utility
industry) published in February 2017, asserts that a single
high-altitude burst over the continental USA would damage only a few,
widely scattered transformers \[46\]. The study is disputed for
underestimating threat levels and using erroneous models \[44\].

These results are incompatible. One's interpretation of the studies on
E3 (and GMD) is based largely on the credibility one gives to the
underlying Commission or Institute, and not the published calculations.

FERC has decided not to proceed with a GMD standard that includes EMP
\[47\]. It will be recalled the GMD standard is 8 V/km. The EMP
Commission, utilizing unclassified measured data from the Soviet era
nuclear tests, found an expected peak level for E3 HEMP for a detonation
over the continental USA would be 85 V/km \[48\].

The position of the electric utility industry is that E3 from a nuclear
detonation is not a critical threat \[49\]. Others have come to a
different conclusion. Israel has hardened her grid \[50\]. She perceives
herself to face an existential threat, and it is not the Sun.

The electric utility industry states the cost of hardening the grid
against EMP is the government's responsibility, not the industry's
\[51\].

Cyberattack

[The vulnerability from a]{.underline} **[cyberattack]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} **[exponentially magnified]{.underline}**
[by]{.underline} our [dependence on]{.underline}
**[SCADAs]{.underline}**.

In 2010, a computer worm attacking SCADA systems was detected. Although
widely spread, it was designed to only attack SCADA systems manufactured
by Siemens for P-1 centrifuges of the Iranian nuclear enrichment
program. The attack destroyed between 10 and 20% of Iranian centrifuges.
Iran's program was likely only briefly disrupted \[52\]. In December
2015, a cyberattack was directed against the Ukrainian power grid. It
caused little damage as the grid was not fully automated.

There is an argument that the cyber threat is exaggerated. Thomas
**[Rid]{.underline}** [states]{.underline} that [viruses and malware
cannot]{.underline} at present [collapse the]{.underline} electric
[grid. "(The world has) never seen a cyber- attack kill a single human
being]{.underline} or destroy a building" \[53\]. [The]{.underline}
electric [utility industry offers a similar perspective]{.underline}. In
testimony on cybersecurity before the Senate Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs Committee, its representative states that "There
are a lot of threats to the grid.....from squirrels to nation states,
and frankly, there have been more blackouts as a result of squirrels
(gnawing wire insulation) then there are from nation states" \[54\].

[Others however express]{.underline} **[concern]{.underline}** \[55\].
Moreover, in a report by the Department of Defense in 2017, it is noted
that "[the]{.underline} **[cyber threat]{.underline}** [to critical US
infrastructure is]{.underline} **[outpacing efforts]{.underline}** [to
reduce]{.underline} pervasive [vulnerabilities]{.underline}." \[56\]
That report notes that "due to our extreme dependence on vulnerable
information systems, [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates today [lives in a]{.underline} virtual **[glass
house]{.underline}**" \[57\].

On March 15, 2018, the Department of Homeland Security issued an alert
that the Russian government had engineered a series of cyberattacks
targeting American and European nuclear power plants and water and
electric systems \[58\]. It is reported these attacks could allow Russia
to sabotage or shut down power plants at will \[59\].

The ability to operate a system in the absence of computer-driven
actions is fast disappearing. The electric power industry spends over
\$1.4 billion dollars annually to replace electromechanical systems and
devices that involve manual operation with new SCADA equipment \[60\].
With modest increases in efficiency come exponential increases in
vulnerability. The extent to which reduced labor costs (and perhaps
reduced energy costs) are passed on to the public is uncertain.

#### Grid collapse causes meltdowns\-\--Extinction

**Nadesan '14** \[Majia; September 13; professor of communication at
ASU, their interdisciplinary research examines the ethical implications
of societal governing logics and risk-management strategies; "The
Nuclear Energy Paradigm Collides with Earth Changes and Technospheric
Breakdown," The Millenium Report,
themillenniumreport.com/2014/09/will-fukushima-become-an-extinction-level-event\]

[**As Technospheric Breakdown Accelerates, Nuclear** Power Generation
**Mishaps will Increase and Intensify**]{.underline}

There is really no way around this eventuality. [As all the nuclear
power plants age, they will succumb to the **micro-stresses** which
**inevitably** occur in such **a**n ever-**deteriorating environment**.
Most people are **unaware** of the true depth and breadth of
technospheric breakdown since it is a concept **rarely taken up by
academia** or the media]{.underline}. The following excerpts provide a
wider perspective of [this unavoidable byproduct of the Industrial
Revolution.]{.underline}

[Technospheric breakdown is something that occurs **everywhere** around
the globe, **24/7**, without interruption, and with tremendous
repercussions]{.underline}. Let's start with [anything that has been
manufactured in the factories of the modern world or built on the
surface of the Earth.]{.underline} Simply put, everything [is in the
constant state of breaking down, degeneration,
deterioration.]{.underline}

What does this really mean when we say that every bridge is slowly
breaking down, every road is in greater disrepair with each passing day,
every reservoir is gradually degrading, every office building, every
factory, every school, every home, etc. most of which adhered to very
low building standards in the first place?

What does it mean when [the infrastructure for every]{.underline} sewer
[system]{.underline}, municipal water division, electrical grid,
airport, railway station, etc. [is in a slow but sure process of
degrading and breaking down. So]{.underline}, unfortunately, [is **every
nuclear power plant across the planet**.]{.underline} (Cosmic
Convergence)

[What makes this ongoing process of physical degradation so insidious is
that it almost always occurs **subliminally**]{.underline}. Through a
gathering array of various forces throughout post-modern civilization,
there does exist a sort of conspiracy of circumstances which has greatly
magnified the effects of technospheric breakdown. The completed marriage
between the industrial base of the Western powers and the financial
class throughout the world has guaranteed that this slow motion collapse
will continue unabated. How so?

Because so many corporate decisions are made according to their impact
on the bottom line, [many inferior nuclear power plants have been
constructed around the globe.]{.underline} Likewise, because the
mega-banks and investment houses are now dictating to a
financially-strapped Nuclear Energy Industry, [**substandard** nuclear
**reactors** have been designed, engineered and **continue to be** put
**in**to **operation** across the planet.]{.underline} One only has to
take a close look at the websites dedicated to decommissioned nuclear
reactors or cold shutdowns or partially closed nuclear power plants or
emergency actions taken at various nuclear power generation sites to
grasp just how precarious a position the entire industry is currently
in.

Unknown to even many of the nuclear engineers who address these issues
'in the office', or who fix the cascade of problems at nuke plants
themselves, is the notion of [slow motion, subclinical, pernicious
technospheric breakdown.]{.underline} It often [manifests in ways where
cause and effect cannot be easily established because of some of the
unseen forces produced by atomic fission.]{.underline} With that said,
it should be noted that a chapter could easily be dedicated to this
particular issue alone, so significant is it to the future of nuclear
power generation

Then there is the problem of **[nuclear wastes]{.underline}** and
natural rights, yes?

No one has articulated this point better than Albert Bates in his
definitive essay entitled The Karma of Kerma: Nuclear Wastes and Natural
Rights (Bates, A.K., 1988)

This extremely lucid and illuminating, sober and sane treatment of [the
**greatest ongoing environmental disaster** of our times]{.underline}
lays bare the most basic legal and human rights issues which [converge
around the production, treatment and storage of nuclear
wastes.]{.underline} Were the governments of the world to read and take
to heart its simple and straightforward thesis, the current incarnation
of nuclear energy production would have been abandoned years ago:

[The disposal of radioactive substances in a manner that anticipates
their eventual partial release into the human environment imposes a
**health burden** upon **future generations** that **cannot be
justified**]{.underline} by any moral or legal rationale. Like an
irresistible force meeting an immovable object, the concept of the
greater good for the many in the present generation runs against the
concept of the inalienable rights of each individual in future eras. At
present, in matters involving nuclear power, our governmental agencies
have taken the side of the irresistible force. But when federal agencies
venture to tread beyond of the scope of the foundation principles with
which the federal government was fashioned, they endanger more than
human lives. At risk in the nuclear waste debate are long-held concepts
of ordered liberty. (Bates A. K., 1988)

Fukushima has illustrated exactly why this elegantly stated legal
concept of human rights and moral imperative is so pertinent to the
public discourse. [When massive amounts of radioactive wastewater are
dumped into the Pacific Ocean, not only **human life** will be adversely
affected. Marine life has been negatively impacted in ways that will
take decades to observe and comprehend.]{.underline} The outright
destruction of the environment in and around Fukushima and the Pacific
Ocean must also be considered in any meaningful assessment of collateral
damage.

Perhaps even more than Chernobyl, [Fukushima has allowed the global
community to view the whole event]{.underline} through the lens of legal
responsibility and ethical outcomes [so that new international standards
can be written and implemented]{.underline} regarding nuclear waste
conveyance and disposal. If nothing else, this discussion has raised
awareness about the most nagging issue concerning the NEP. Whereas the
human rights aspect confers the legal right to not be contaminated by
nuclear radiation has barely been addressed by those responsible for it
consequences, it now enjoys a prominent place throughout the worldwide
debate.

[Accidents and mishaps, manmade and natural disasters
happen.]{.underline} Things are fixed fairly quickly in this postmodern
age, and life goes on. Whether these events occur in a full-blown war
zone or in the wake of a hurricane, the affected population usually does
everything it can to rebuild and move on.

[However, when these events take place in or near nuclear power plants,
**life** doesn't just go on. It often **stops**]{.underline}. Depending
on the circumstances and seriousness of a nuclear event, [sometimes life
stops in that area for a long time.]{.underline}

[Our **civilization** has]{.underline} now [been given]{.underline}
three unmistakable **[wakeup calls]{.underline}** since the advent of
the nuclear power generation era. First there was [Three Mile
Island]{.underline} in Pennsylvania, then there was
[Chernobyl]{.underline} in the Ukraine, and lastly the world is still
reeling from the specter of possibilities which are presented by
[Fukushima]{.underline}.

Surely [it is not by chance that these three flagrant examples of
nuclear Perfect Storms occurred around the globe affecting major nations
and populations centers]{.underline}. Each of these disasters has served
to wake up whole swaths of humanity to the dangers and risks which are
associated with the current Nuclear Energy Paradigm. To ignore, or deny,
or refute the obvious lessons which all three nuclear catastrophes have
given to humankind would be folly of the highest order.

[The **global impact** of Fukushima, which has disseminated
radionuclides (radioactive contaminants) by air and by way of the
largest of the seven seas, stands as dramatic testimony to all that can
go wrong]{.underline} --- seriously wrong --- with the current nuclear
energy business model and method of power generation. [**Can it get any
worse** than Fukushima? That we are compelled to even ask this question
speaks volumes about the true state of the affairs]{.underline} on that
25 square mile patch of land and contiguous sea which surround the
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster site.

Given this inescapable testament of nuclear folly, it is now incumbent
upon the community of nations to rally around the obvious necessity of
terminating the current form of the Nuclear Energy Paradigm. Why?
Because when a "China Syndrome" occurs anywhere in the world, **[it will
inevitably affect the entire planet]{.underline}**. In other words, an
INES Level 7 (Wikipedia, International Nuclear Event Scale) [nuclear
catastrophe does not respect borders. Nor does it discriminate between
the young and old, healthy and sick, or those who live close to ground
zero from those who live far away.]{.underline}

Therefore, any nation that chooses to set up a nuclear energy-producing
operation from this point forward has an inviolable responsibility to
its neighbors, as it does to the rest of the world. Likewise, those
[nations have a moral obligation to proceed in a manner that guarantees
its neighbors will not be exposed to the consequences of its nuclear
accidents, even when they are caused by duel **natural disaster** events
as we saw at Fukushima.]{.underline}

Just as Europe was contaminated with radiation from Chernobyl (Yablokov,
A.V., 2009), and North America has been contaminated from Fukushima, it
is understood that [once a nuclear catastrophe spirals out of control,
the genie of radioactive **contamination cannot be put back in the
bottle**.]{.underline} The entire Pacific Rim, in fact, has varying
degrees of exposure to the radioactive waste water being conveyed by the
ocean from Fukushima, as does the Western Hemisphere to seaborne
radioactive isotopes like Cesium-137 and airborne isotopes such as
Iodine-131(Center for Marine and Environmental Radiation).

Consequently, Japan is responsible for the damage wrought to the largest
ocean on Earth. Have they acknowledged this? Have they approached the
nations both near and far which have been affected by their cavalier and
irresponsible approach to siting reactors up and down their seismic
shorelines? Has the United Nations even addressed this extremely
important issue known as national accountability? Or territorial
sovereignty?

Conclusion

It doesn't get very much more weighty than the 'fallout from Fukushima'.
All of the affected nations have been curiously silent on this issue. It
is almost as though a conspiracy of silence has descended upon the
concerned countries because of how unpredictable and intractable the
nuclear containment problems have been at the Daiichi plant.

At the end of the day [the current race of **humanity** will look back
on the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster as the **defining
moment**]{.underline} for both the industry and the underlying paradigm.
If they haven't already, the [various stakeholders will be forced to
re-evaluate the integrity of their nuclear enterprises]{.underline}
around the globe. [**Hopefully**, they will begin to take aggressive
**preemptive measures** to address whatever needs to be addressed at
every nuclear site still in operation.]{.underline}

[If a **decisive response** is not formulated]{.underline} and
implemented on a global scale, in light of the hard lessons learned from
Fukushima, [the current planetary **civilization** will be compelled to
face up to these **fatal flaws** in most unpleasant ways, which will
continue to manifest with each major Earth change.]{.underline} In a
similar way, the inherent [defects]{.underline} of the NEP [will only be
accentuated as technospheric breakdown accelerates.]{.underline} The
profound and fundamental shortcomings which pervade the entire nuclear
energy industry can no longer be hidden or ignored.

After all, it was the dangerous combination of willful blindness and
feigned ignorance which got the world into this position in the first
place.

"[Does anyone in their right mind believe that nuclear power plants can
ever be designed, engineered or constructed to withstand 9.0 earthquakes
followed by 15 meter high tsunamis?]{.underline} Sorry if we offend, but
such a display of so deadly a combination of ignorance and arrogance
must represent the very height of hubris. Particularly in view of the
inevitable consequences which have manifested at Fukushima, how is it
that so few saw this pre-ordained and disastrous outcome, except by
willful blindness?"

### 2AC\-\--Nuclear War Causes Extinction

#### Even a small nuclear war causes extinction and destroys the ozone

**Starr 14** \[Steven Starr, the Senior Scientist for Physicians for
Social Responsibility and Director of the Clinical Laboratory Science
Program at the University of Missouri. Starr has published in the
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and the Strategic Arms Reduction
(STAR) website of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, June
11, 2014, "There Can be No Winners in a Nuclear War", Truth Out,
[https://truthout.org/articles/there-can-be-no-winners-in-a-nuclear-war](https://truthout.org/articles/there-can-be-no-winners-in-a-nuclear-war/)\]

[Nuclear war has no winner]{.underline}. Beginning in 2006, several of
[the world's leading climatologists]{.underline} (at Rutgers, UCLA, John
Hopkins University, and the University of Colorado-Boulder) [published a
series of studies that evaluated the long-term environmental
consequences of a nuclear war]{.underline}, [including baseline
scenarios fought with merely 1% of the explosive power in the US and/or
Russian launch-ready nuclear arsenals]{.underline}. [They concluded that
the consequences of **even a "small" nuclear war would include
catastrophic disruptions of global climate** and massive destruction of
Earth's protective ozone layer]{.underline}. These and more recent
studies predict that global agriculture would be so negatively affected
by such a war, a global famine would result, which would cause up to 2
billion people to starve to death. These peer-reviewed studies -- which
were analyzed by the best scientists in the world and found to be
without error -- also predict that a war fought with less than half of
US or Russian strategic [nuclear weapons would destroy the human
race]{.underline}. In other words, a US-Russian nuclear war would
[create such extreme long-term damage to the global environment that it
would leave the Earth uninhabitable for humans and most animal forms of
life]{.underline}. A recent article in the Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists, "Self-assured destruction: The climate impacts of nuclear
war," begins by stating: "[A nuclear war]{.underline} between Russia and
the United States, even after the arsenal reductions planned under New
START, [could produce a nuclear winter. Hence, an attack by either side
could be suicidal, resulting in self-assured destruction]{.underline}."
In 2009, I wrote "Catastrophic Climatic Consequences of Nuclear
Conflicts" for the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation
and Disarmament. The article summarizes the findings of these studies.
[It explains that nuclear firestorms would produce millions of tons of
smoke, which would rise above cloud level and form a global
stratospheric smoke layer that would rapidly encircle the Earth. The
smoke layer would remain for at least a decade, and it would act to
destroy the protective ozone layer]{.underline} ([vastly increasing the
UV-B reaching Earth]{.underline}) [as well as block warming sunlight,
thus creating Ice Age weather conditions]{.underline} that would last 10
years or longer. Following a US-Russian nuclear war,
[temperatures]{.underline} in the central US and Eurasia [would fall
below freezing every day]{.underline} for one to three years[; the
intense cold would completely eliminate growing seasons]{.underline} for
a decade or longer. [No crops could be grown, leading to a famine that
would kill most humans and large animal populations.
**E**lectro**m**agnetic **p**ulse from high-altitude nuclear detonations
would destroy the integrated circuits in all modern electronic devices,
including those in commercial nuclear power plants. Every nuclear
reactor would almost **instantly meltdown**; every nuclear spent fuel
pool]{.underline} (which contain many times more radioactivity than
found in the reactors) [would boil off, releasing vast amounts of
long-lived radioactivity. The fallout]{.underline} would make most of
the US and Europe **[uninhabitable]{.underline}**. Of course, [the
survivors of the nuclear war would be starving to death]{.underline}
anyway. Once nuclear weapons were introduced into a US-Russian conflict,
there would be little chance that a nuclear holocaust could be avoided.
[Theories of "limited nuclear war" and "nuclear de-escalation" are
unrealistic]{.underline}. In 2002 the Bush administration modified US
strategic doctrine from a retaliatory role to permit preemptive nuclear
attack; in 2010, the Obama administration made only incremental and
miniscule changes to this doctrine, leaving it essentially unchanged.
Furthermore, Counterforce doctrine -- used by both the US and Russian
military -- emphasizes the need for preemptive strikes once nuclear war
begins. Both sides would be under immense pressure to launch a
preemptive nuclear first-strike once military hostilities had commenced,
especially if nuclear weapons had already been used on the battlefield.
Both the US and Russia each have 400 to 500 launch-ready ballistic
missiles armed with a total of at least 1800 strategic nuclear warheads,
which can be launched with only a few minutes warning. Both the US and
Russian Presidents are accompanied 24/7 by military officers carrying a
"nuclear briefcase," which allows them to transmit the permission order
to launch in a matter of seconds. Yet top political leaders and
policymakers of both the US and Russia seem to be unaware that their
launch-ready nuclear weapons represent a self-destruct mechanism for the
human race. For example, in 2010, I was able to publicly question the
chief negotiators of the New START treaty, Russian Ambassador Anatoly
Antonov and (then) US Assistant Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller,
during their joint briefing at the UN (during the Non-Proliferation
Treaty Review Conference). I asked them if they were familiar with the
recent peer-reviewed studies that predicted the detonation of less than
1% of the explosive power contained in the operational and deployed US
and Russian nuclear forces would cause catastrophic changes in the
global climate, and that a nuclear war fought with their strategic
nuclear weapons would kill most people on Earth. They both answered
"no." More recently, on April 20, 2014, I asked the same question and
received the same answer from the US officials sent to brief
representatives of the NGOS at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Preparatory
Committee meeting at the UN. None of the US officials at the briefing
were aware of the studies. Those present included top officials of the
National Security Council. It is frightening that President Obama and
his administration appear unaware that the world's leading scientists
have for years predicted that a nuclear war fought with the US and/or
Russian strategic nuclear arsenal means the end of human history. Do
they not know of the existential threat these arsenals pose to the human
race . . . or do they choose to remain silent because this fact doesn't
fit into their official narratives? We hear only about terrorist threats
that could destroy a city with an atomic bomb, while the threat of human
extinction from nuclear war is never mentioned -- even when the US and
Russia are each running huge nuclear war games in preparation for a
US-Russian war. Even more frightening is the fact that the neocons
running [US foreign policy believe that the US has "nuclear
primacy"]{.underline} over Russia; [that is, the US could successfully
launch a nuclear sneak attack against]{.underline} Russian (and
[Chinese]{.underline}) [nuclear forces and completely destroy
them]{.underline}. This theory was articulated in 2006 in "The Rise of
U.S. Nuclear Primacy," which was published in Foreign Affairs by the
Council on Foreign Relations. By concluding that the Russians and
Chinese would be unable to retaliate, or if some small part of their
forces remained, would not risk a second US attack by retaliating, the
article invites nuclear war. Colonel Valery Yarynich (who was in charge
of security of the Soviet/Russian nuclear command and control systems
for 7 years) asked me to help him write a rebuttal, which was titled
"**[Nuclear Primacy is a Fallacy]{.underline}**." Colonel Yarynich, who
was on the Soviet General Staff and did war planning for the USSR,
concluded that the "[Primacy]{.underline}" article [used faulty
methodology and erroneous assumptions]{.underline}, thus invalidating
its conclusions. My contribution lay in my knowledge of the recently
published (in 2006) studies, which predicted [**even a "successful"
nuclear first-strike**, which destroyed 100% of the opposing side's
nuclear weapons, would cause the citizens of the side that "won" the
nuclear war to **perish from nuclear famine**, just as would the rest of
humanity]{.underline}.

titled "Confronting future catastrophic threats to humanity.", "The Risk
of Nuclear Winter", FAS, May 29 2015,
<https://fas.org/pir-pubs/risk-nuclear-winter/>

Since the early 1980s, the world has known that a [large nuclear war
could cause **severe global environmental effects**, including dramatic
cooling of surface temperatures, declines in precipitation, and
increased ultraviolet radiation]{.underline}. The term [nuclear winter
was coined specifically to refer to cooling that result in winter-like
temperatures occurring year-round]{.underline}. **[Regardless of whether
such temperatures are reached, there would be severe consequences for
humanity]{.underline}**. But [how severe would those consequences
be?]{.underline} And what should the world be doing about it? To the
first question, the short answer is **[nobody knows.]{.underline}** [The
total human impacts of nuclear winter are both **uncertain and
under-studied**]{.underline}. **[In light of the
uncertainty]{.underline}**, [a risk perspective is warranted that
considers the **breadth of possible impacts, weighted by their
probability**]{.underline}. More research on the impacts would be very
helpful, but [we can]{.underline} meanwhile [make some general
conclusions.]{.underline} That is enough to start answering the second
question, what we should do. In regards to what we should do, nuclear
winter has some interesting and important policy implications. Today,
nuclear winter is not a hot topic but this was not always the case: it
was international headline news in the 1980s. There were conferences,
Congressional hearings, voluminous scientific research, television
specials, and more. The story is expertly captured by Lawrence Badash in
his book A Nuclear Winter's Tale.1)Much of the 1980s attention to
nuclear winter was driven by the enthusiastic efforts of Carl Sagan,
then at the height of his popularity. But underlying it all was the fear
of nuclear war, stoked by some of the tensest moments of the Cold War.
[When the Cold War ended, so too did attention to nuclear
winter]{.underline}. That started to change in [2007]{.underline}, with
a new line of nuclear winter [research]{.underline}2) [that uses
advanced climate models developed for the study of global
warming]{.underline}. Relative to the 1980s research, the new research
found that **[the smoke from nuclear firestorms would travel higher up
in the atmosphere, causing nuclear winter to last longer]{.underline}**.
This research also found dangerous effects from smaller nuclear wars,
such as an India-Pakistan nuclear war detonating "only" 100 total
nuclear weapons. Two groups---one in the United States3) and one in
Switzerland4)---have found similar results using different climate
models, [lending further support to the validity of the
research.]{.underline} Some new research has also examined the human
impacts of nuclear winter. [Researchers simulated agricultural crop
growth in the aftermath of a 100-weapon India-Pakistan nuclear
war]{.underline}.5)**[The results are startling]{.underline}**- the
[scenario could cause agriculture productivity to decline by around **10
to 40 percent** for several years after the war]{.underline}. The
studies looked at major staple crops in China and the United States, two
of the largest food producers. [Other countries and other crops would
likely face similar declines.]{.underline} Following such crop declines,
**[severe global famine could ensue]{.underline}**. One study estimated
the total extent of the famine by comparing crop declines to global
malnourishment data.6) When food becomes scarce, the poor and
malnourished are typically hit the hardest. [This study estimated two
billion people at risk of starvation]{.underline}. And this is from the
100-weapon India-Pakistan nuclear war scenario. **[Larger nuclear wars
would have more severe impacts. This is where the recent research
stops]{.underline}**. To the best of my knowledge [there are no recent
studies examining the secondary effects of famines, such as **disease
outbreaks and violent conflicts**]{.underline}. There are no recent
studies examining the human impacts of ultraviolet radiation. That would
include an increased medical burden in skin cancer and other diseases.
It would also include further loss of agriculture ecosystem services as
the ultraviolet radiation harms plants and animals. At this time, we can
only make educated guesses about what these impacts would be, informed
in part by what research was published 30 years ago. When analyzing the
risk of nuclear winter, one question is of paramount importance: Would
there be permanent harm to human civilization? Humanity could have a
very bright future ahead; to dim that future is the worst thing nuclear
winter could do. It is vastly worse than a few billion deaths from
starvation. Not that a few billion deaths is trivial---obviously it
isn't---but it is tiny compared to the loss of future generations. Carl
Sagan was one of the first people to recognize this point in a
commentary he wrote on nuclear winter for Foreign Affairs.7) Sagan
believed nuclear winter could cause human extinction, in which case all
members of future generations would be lost. He argued that this made
nuclear winter vastly more important than the direct effects of nuclear
war, which could, in his words, "kill 'only' hundreds of millions of
people." Sagan was however, right that human extinction would cause
permanent harm to human civilization. It is debatable whether nuclear
winter could cause human extinction. Alan Robock, a leader of the recent
nuclear winter research, believes it is unlikely. He writes: "Especially
in Australia and New Zealand, humans would have a better chance to
survive."8) This is hardly a cheerful statement, and it leaves open the
chance of human extinction. I think that's the best way of looking at
it. [Given all the uncertainty and the limited available research, it is
**impossible to rule out the possibility of human
extinction**]{.underline}. I don't have a good answer for how likely it
is. But the possibility should not be dismissed. Even if some humans
survive, there could still be permanent harm to human civilization.
[Small patches of survivors would be extremely vulnerable to
**subsequent disasters**]{.underline}. They also could not keep up the
massively complex civilization we enjoy today. It would be a long and
uncertain rebuilding process and survivors might never get civilization
back to where it is now. More importantly, they might never get
civilization to where we now stand poised to take it in the future. Our
potentially bright future could be forever dimmed.9) Nuclear winter is a
very large and serious risk. But that on its own doesn't mean
much---just another thing to worry about. What's really important are
the implications of nuclear winter for public policy and private action.

war between India and Pakistan would pose an existential threat to both
countries. A larger nuclear war would threaten humanity itself. These
realities make bolt-from-blue strikes much less likely and in turn,
reduce the imperative for pre-emptive strikes.

[EMP from a 1-kiloton weapon, though "weak" in comparison to a
megaton-range EMP, could still have **catastrophic
consequences**]{.underline} for the critical infrastructures that
sustain the U.S. economy and society. This is so because
[the]{.underline} US electrical [power grid]{.underline}, which supports
all the other critical infrastructures, [is extremely fragile and
vulnerable to any EMP attack. Modern microelectronics are over one
million times more vulnerable to EMP]{.underline} than electronic
systems of the 1960s, and could be damaged or destroyed by the EMP from
a low-yield nuclear weapon detonated high enough to cover, for example,
the eastern United States. Safety relays and SCADAs (System Control And
Data Acquisition) control everything, including the current flowing into
big transformers that are indispensable to the power grid, and that
currently would require years to be repaired or replaced.4 Dr. [Butt
himself provides anecdotal evidence illustrating the shocking fragility
of the electric power grid, citing the]{.underline} August 2003
[Northeast Blackout]{.underline} [and the cascading failures that
resulted when a high voltage power line was assaulted by a tree
branch:]{.underline} The outage affected the Northeast US and parts of
Canada and more than 200 power plants, including several nuclear plants,
were shut down as a result of the electricity cutoff. Other effects
included loss of water pressure, possible sewage contamination,
gridlock, various other transportation problems (because of secondary
effects on railways, airlines, and gas stations), and disruption of oil
refineries' operations. Phone service was stressed due to high call
volume and several radio and television stations went off the air. It is
estimated that [the one-day blackout cost \$7--10 billion in spoiled
food, lost production, overtime wages, and other related expenses
inflicted on more than one-seventh of the US population]{.underline}.
All of this from a tree branch. It is not an isolated incident. [The EMP
Commission found many large-scale blackouts of the power grid that were
started by a]{.underline} seemingly [trivial local problem.4 A low-yield
nuclear weapon]{.underline} detonated to place an EMP field over the
entire eastern portion of the United States [would]{.underline}
certainly [place more stress on the electric grid than a single tree
branch, and multiply the above effects manifold by causing many local
failures, that could **cascade into a national
catastrophe**.]{.underline}

The conclusions reached in this thesis demonstrate how [**economic

into the calculus for **future conflicts**]{.underline}. The findings
also suggest that [**security issues** with **economic or financial
underpinnings** will **transcend** classical determinants of war and
conflict, and change the manner by which **rival states** engage in
**hostile acts**]{.underline} toward one another. The research shows
that [**security concerns** emanating from **economic uncertainty** and
**the inherent vulnerabilities** within **global financial markets**
will present **new challenges** for national securi]{.underline}ty, and
provide developing states new asymmetric options for balancing against
stronger states.

The security areas, identified in the proceeding chapters, are likely to
mature into global security threats in the immediate future. As the case
study on South Korea suggest, the overlapping security issues associated
with **[economic decline]{.underline}** and reduced military spending
[by the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will affect **allied
confidence** in **America's security guarantees**]{.underline}. The
study shows that this outcome could cause regional instability or
realignments of strategic partnerships in the Asia-pacific region with
ramifications for U.S. national security. [Rival states]{.underline} and
non-state groups may also [become **emboldened** to challenge
**America's status** in **the unipolar international
system**]{.underline}.

The potential [risks]{.underline} associated with **[stolen or loose
WMD]{.underline}**, resulting from poor security, can also pose a threat
to U.S. national security. The case study on Pakistan, Syria and North
Korea show how [**financial constraints** affect **weapons security**
making weapons **vulnerable to theft**]{.underline}, and how
**[financial factors]{.underline}** can [influence **WMD
proliferation**]{.underline} [by contributing to **the motivating

to the current international system or distribution of power, with
[opportunities to disrupt global finance and]{.underline} perhaps
[weaken America's status]{.underline}. A more ominous threat originates
from states intent on increasing diversification of foreign currency
holdings, establishing alternatives to the dollar for international
trade, or engaging financial warfare against the United States.

What appears to be of particular concern to the EMP commission is the
scepter of terrorist groups or so-called "rogue" nations carrying out
such an attack. As outlined by Dr. Pry, one of the commissioners, before
a 2005 Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland
Security, "\[a\] nuclear missile concealed in the hold of a freighter
would give Iran, or terrorists, the capability to perform an EMP attack
against the United States homeland, without developing an ICBM, and with
some prospect of remaining anonymous. Iran's Shahab-3 medium-range
[missile]{.underline}... is a mobile missile, and small enough to be
transported in the hold of a freighter." However, as mentioned above,
such missiles [have a payload capacity of approximately 1,000
kilograms]{.underline} corresponding to a crude U-based warhead of \~1
kiloton yield \[22\]---if, and when, the Iranians eventually develop
nuclear weapons. [Even the North Koreans, who are much further along in
their weapons program, have had great difficulty reaching even a \~5
kiloton yield]{.underline} from their Pu-based devices in carefully
orchestrated ground-tests, and their 2009 test was likely a fizzle.
Thus, it is not at all a simple matter, [even for countries with
considerable resources and focused decades-long effort, to build such
weapons, let alone pair them to reliable delivery systems.]{.underline}
As carefully argued by John Mueller in his new book, Atomic Obsession,
**[it is virtually impossible]{.underline}** [for a terrorist cell to
obtain the raw materials needed for a nuclear device and assemble it
correctly themselves]{.underline} \[Ref 22, p. 172--198\]. [Even a
"crude" U-type device is not all that "crude" and requires the concerted
effort of skilled scientists and engineers. Any weapon
produced]{.underline} by a terrorist cell would likely be a one of a
kind and [would have to remain untested]{.underline}. For a terrorist
group to then mate this weapon to a ballistic missile and successfully
carry out an EMP strike beggars belief. As John Pike, director of
GlobalSecurity.org has said, "[It is just very difficult to imagine how
terrorists are going to be able to lay hands on a nuclear-tipped
missile, and launch it and reprogram it in such a way that it would be a
high-altitude burst like that]{.underline}."

[Many weapons experts doubt that an EMP attack could cause lasting or
irreversible damage]{.underline}. [Stephen Younger, former senior fellow
at Los Alamos National Lab]{.underline} and director at the Defense
Threat Reduction Agency, [argues]{.underline} that while an EMP might
create problems in the short term, [it is unlikely to cause long-term
devastation.]{.underline} Similarly, [observers have questioned the
capacity of North Korea or Iran, much less a terrorist organization, to
develop a warhead sophisticated enough to cause widespread EMP
damage.]{.underline} Nick Schwellenbach, a former researcher at Project
on Government Oversight, suggests that [the idea of a small,
EMP-optimized warhead is absurd: \"You have a lot of points of failure
in order to get to a warhead that is EMP optimized.]{.underline} ...
\[Y\]ou need specialized machine tools, you need capital, but to create
a weapon that creates the secondary effect that you\'re talking about,
[that\'s something even we can\'t do right now."]{.underline}

[A state would be highly unlikely to launch an EMP strike from their own
territory because the rocket could be traced to the country of origin
and would probably result in]{.underline} nuclear or massive
conventional [retaliation by the US.]{.underline} The EMP commission
also considers adversarial nations carrying out [a shipborne EMP
attack]{.underline} that would be less traceable. However, even so,
there [would]{.underline} some small [risk]{.underline} of [trace-back
that would give the leadership in such nations pause]{.underline}. While
nuclear forensics are not well enough developed to assuredly ascribe the
origin of a nuclear explosion, even [their current state of
development]{.underline} [would, in some measure, dissuade the leaders
of a nation from seriously contemplating such an attack]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [the US certainly has data, via its DSP satellites, on the
infrared (IR) signatures of the rocket exhausts from the missiles of
various countries]{.underline}. Though these signatures are probably
virtually identical for the Scud/Shahab/No-dong family of missiles, the
nations which may entertain such attacks do not necessarily know
whether, e.g., the DSP data can discriminate between a NK Nodong versus
an Iranian Shahabs, perhaps due to differences in fuel and/or subtle
design idiosyncrasies. This is data only the US has, and it has an
inherent deterrent value to nations thinking about launching an EMP
strike via a ship-launched ballistic missile. This is almost certainly
the case if, say, Iran were to use its solid rocket motor technology to
launch such a strike---if and when Iran obtains nuclear weapons, of
course. In such a case, [the burn time-profile and solid-motor IR
signatures could probably be used to tie the missile to a
nation]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the leaders of a nation contemplating
such an attack would have to carefully consider what would happen in
case the warhead was not delivered properly]{.underline}. If it fell
short and/or did not explode, [it may be possible for US engineers and
scientists to ascribe a national origin]{.underline} given the forensic
material. For [the leadership]{.underline} of any nation to chance such
an attack they [must be almost **suicidally optimistic**]{.underline}:
they would have to presume that everything would go perfectly. Even so,
[it may still be possible to identify the country of origin, which would
**invite massive US retribution**]{.underline}.

Though they possess the technological know-how to fabricate a powerful
EMP device, [the possibility of China or Russia carrying out such an
attack is **virtually nil**]{.underline}. Not only for the regular
military deterrent reasons but also, post-Cold War, [our economies are
intimately linked, which amounts to an inherent economic
deterrent.]{.underline} The latter is likely the more relevant deterrent
\[Ref. 22, p. 65\]. [We owe China tremendous sums of money, they need us
as a market, and both the US and China require Russian oil via
intertwined world markets]{.underline}. Although the EMP commissioners
have offered [a Chinese]{.underline}-language [PowerPoint]{.underline}
presentation outlining the effects of EMP devices as evidence that China
has an interest in such weapons, this [presentation is actually of
Taiwanese origin]{.underline} \["Electromagnetic Pulse Attack and
Defense", by Dr. Chien Chung\], [and it is not pertinent to any official
Chinese military doctrine.]{.underline} More importantly, the DoD itself
has weighed in on the issue in its "Militarily Critical Technologies
List". This is a detailed compendium of the technologies the DoD
assesses as critical to maintaining superior United States military
capabilities. Part II, "Weapons of Mass Destruction Technologies,"
addresses those technologies required for development, integration, or
employment of biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons and their means
of delivery against the US. This document states that "HEMP can pose a
serious threat to U.S. military systems when even a single high-altitude
nuclear explosion occurs. In principle, even a new nuclear proliferator
could execute such a strike. [In practice, however, it seems unlikely
that such a state would use one of its scarce warheads to inflict damage
which must be considered secondary to the primary effects of
blast]{.underline}, shock, and thermal pulse. Furthermore, [a HEMP
attack must use a relatively large warhead to be effective]{.underline}
(perhaps on the order of one megaton), [and new proliferators are
unlikely to be able to construct such a device, much less make it small
enough to be lofted to high altitude by a ballistic missile or space
launcher]{.underline}."

[The central political purpose of the EMP awareness movement appears to
be advancement of the cause of missile defense]{.underline}. The most
extreme estimates of the effect of EMP restore the Cold War-era
existential fears of nuclear war. Schwellenbach argues \"what\'s driving
it is the political global context---[it gives the right an issue that
allows them to justify hawkish behavior. It is almost a perfect solution
to any argument against missile defense---North Korea and Iran." The 90
percent casualty estimate advanced by EMP awareness advocates hypes the
notion that]{.underline} the United States faces potential annihilation
at the hands of its enemies, and goes a step farther[: even the smallest
nuclear power can destroy the United States]{.underline} with a small
number of warheads. [This, in turn, reaffirms the need for]{.underline}
both a secure missile defense shield (including [space-based interceptor
weapons]{.underline}) and a grand strategy of preventive war against
potential nuclear and ballistic missile proliferators[. Almost all EMP
awareness advocates]{.underline}---including Gaffney, Gingrich, and

Gaffney and Gingrich have also called for a "robust" policy of
preemptive war, including attacks on Iranian and North Korean missiles

[The fact that EMP is poorly researched and not well understood works in
its favor as a scare tactic.]{.underline} Since evidence of EMP's
allegedly lasting impact is purely theoretical [EMP awareness advocates
can make outlandish claims regarding the threat that even the smallest
nuclear arsenal poses. They can also point to allegations made by the
official EMP Commission, ignoring the fact that many outside experts
dispute its findings.]{.underline} The Niagara conference's emphasis on
strategic and policy considerations shows that [alarmist predictions

**Crowley 9** **-** Michael Crowley, senior correspondent and deputy
Washington bureau chief for Time magazine, 6-3-09, "The Newt Bomb" The
New Republic, <http://www.tnr.com/article/the-newt-bomb>

The EMP commission actually had a point. There is a scientific basis for
fears about widespread electric outages, and there is evidence that
other countries, possibly including Iran, have studied the technique.
\"EMP is real,\" agrees Joe Cirincione, a nuclear weapons expert who now
runs a pro-disarmament think tank, the Ploughshares Fund. But, as
Cirincione notes, [few analysts take the threat very seriously. The odds
that Iran or North Korea would prefer a technologically untested Rube
Goldberg scheme to merely nuking us seem slim]{.underline}. [And any
terrorist group able to execute such a plan was probably capable enough
to get us one way or another anyhow]{.underline}. [Those realities argue
overwhelmingly for prudent but unsexy infrastructure
protections]{.underline}, not preemptive attacks or advanced technology.
\"It\'s horror theater,\" says Cirincione, \"trying to scare Americans
into doing something which a rational analysis would stop them from
doing.\" Charles Ferguson, a nuclear engineer at the Council on Foreign
Relations, agrees. [\"\[T\]here are some important things we can be
doing that won\'t cost much, but that can serve as a vital
backup,\"]{.underline} he says. [For instance, Ferguson has advised the
New York City Fire Department to keep some backup communications
equipment and extra ignition switches for its trucks in electromagnetic
pulse-resistant steel cages. The hawkish right, however, has much bigger
things in mind]{.underline}. Although Bartlett himself seems to lack a
sub-rosa strategic agenda, he has found common cause among
national-security conservatives, about whom the same can\'t be said[.
Take, for instance, the spin of Frank Gaffney, perhaps the right\'s main
missile-defense zealot]{.underline}: \"\[T\]he United States must now
make a redoubled effort to deploy effective, comprehensive defenses
against ballistic missiles that might be used for EMP and other
attacks,\" Gaffney wrote in a 2006 National Review article. [Republican
Senator Jon Kyl, a key missile-defense champion on Capitol Hill, has
held hearings and published a Washington Post op-ed on the EMP
threat]{.underline}. The like-minded Wall Street Journal opinion pages
have repeatedly flogged the EMP commission\'s findings. \"The only
solution to this \[EMP\] problem,\" [Brian T. Kennedy of the Claremont
Institute wrote in an op-ed in the pages last November, \"is a robust,
multilayered missile-defense system.\"]{.underline}

**Schwellenbach 5,** Nick, AlterNet, cites individuals on the Council of
Foreign Relations, "The Next Fake Threat,"
<http://www.alternet.org/story/25738/>

Perhaps the most controversial of the EMP Commission\'s claims is their
insistence that a Hiroshima-sized nuclear detonation (10-20 kilotons)
could produce enough EMP to fry circuits across a continent. The EMP
Commission points to one of the few case studies available \-- the
Starfish Prime atmospheric nuclear test of 1962. [A 1.4 megaton
thermonuclear weapon detonated 250 miles above Johnston Island in the
Pacific affected street lamps]{.underline}, circuit breakers, cars and
radio stations [in Hawaiia]{.underline}n, 800 miles to the north. Still,
[even there the effect was **far from comprehensive**]{.underline}. Los
Alamos National Laboratory physicist Michael P. Bernardin said that
\"[the 30 strings of failed streetlights]{.underline} \[from Starfish
Prime\'s EMP\] [represented only about **one percent of the
streetlamps**]{.underline} on Oahu at the time.\" And noted physicist
Richard Garwin said [the Starfish detonation \"had **barely noticeable
effects** on military systems.\"]{.underline} But [Starfish Prime was a
thermonuclear device with a yield over a hundred times that of the bomb
dropped on Hiroshima. Experts]{.underline} including Garwin and Philip
Coyle, former Pentagon director of operational test and evaluation,
[have expressed skepticism about the EMP Commission\'s claim that a
10-20 kiloton nuclear device could produce EMP on par with that of a
thermonuclear weapon.]{.underline} **[Both have extensive experience
studying EMP.]{.underline}**

Krea University; \"Degrowth and COVID-19: Are we drawing a simplistic
connection?\"
https://india.mongabay.com/2020/04/commentary-degrowth-and-covid-19-are-we-drawing-a-simplistic-connection/\]

COVID-19 economic pause: Can we equate with degrowth?

Many [scholars are **comparing**]{.underline} [the **current state** of
the economy with the state of **degrowth**]{.underline}. However, I
argue [this comparison is not only]{.underline} **[conceptually
incorrect]{.underline}** [but also]{.underline}
**[simplistic]{.underline}**. At first, we need to acknowledge that [the
pandemic is an]{.underline} [**external**, independent factor that is
inducing such a drastic downshift in the economy. There is **no
change**]{.underline} [happening at the **systemic level**]{.underline}
[to ensure the **sustainability**]{.underline} [of such a
shift]{.underline}.

Such [a pandemic is denoted as an upshot of climate crisis and
disruption in the ecological balance. In the coming future,
with]{.underline} [**resorting to business as usual**, such external
events are likely to be frequent and intense. However]{.underline}, once
we manage to find our way around such an external factor, even if
temporarily, [the economy is **waiting to bounce back**]{.underline} [to
its normal. Moreover]{.underline}, as observed in the post-world war II
economic boom, [the economy is likely to reach a]{.underline} **[higher
throughput]{.underline}** [than the initial after the
lockdown]{.underline}.

[To sustain the drastic downshift of the economy that resembles
degrowth, consumers have a major role to play]{.underline} in the
realisation of such a massive economic shift [as the current capitalist
economy is entirely fueled by **consumer desires**]{.underline}. In our
lives, [we consciously or at times unconsciously uphold a]{.underline}
**[notion of a good life]{.underline}**. [This amicable notion guides us
continuously in making decisions]{.underline}, be it life-changing ones
or concerning everyday affairs.

My research, as well as several anthropological studies, show how the
**[prevailing notions]{.underline}** [of the good life have slowly
turned into being **materialistic**]{.underline}. [It means now we use
**material goods**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [**earn status**,
**construct identities**, and **mark success**]{.underline} [and value
them over intangible things like relationships.]{.underline}

[Our life stories are now stitched around material
possessions]{.underline} that we carefully choose. These notions are
socio-culturally constructed. One's social upbringing and conditioning
enable the seeping of certain notions of good life over others. [These
socio-culturally **construed notions** are influenced by the economic
climate to give rise to **insatiable desires**]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} **[false needs]{.underline}** [among
consumers]{.underline}.

Upshots of COVID-19- a welcome push towards practising degrowth

[To achieve a **sustained state** of **degrowth**]{.underline}, we as
[consumers need to realize the intricate interconnection between our
constructed notions of a good life and our consumption
decision]{.underline}. A realisation of how we as consumers are turned
into this driving force, that is running the entire economic juggernaut
by discounting ecological balance and a consequent conscious decision to
move away from it, would be the first step to degrowth.

[As the second step, we need to ensure that the wealth produced in
degrowth or controlled growth of the economy should **entirely be
diverted**]{.underline} [to ensuring a good life for]{.underline} the
socio-economically **[underprivileged]{.underline}** ones, [which
requires a certain amount of **sacrifice from the
privileged**]{.underline} sections of the society. However, this would
not appear as a sacrifice if we can adopt alternative notions of a good
life that value the current state of the environment and social justice
over a world obsessed with material possessions and growth.

[A **sustained change** in the economic system can **only come** if the
**main internal driving force** of the system]{.underline} --
[consumers]{.underline} -- [starts valuing things that the current
system cannot simply offer.]{.underline} It is going to be
[a]{.underline} **[slow]{.underline}** [socio-cultural
shift]{.underline}, but that seems to be the only way to realise a
sustained change.

[The global economy is hurtling humanity toward extinction]{.underline}.
Greenhouse gas emissions are on track to warm the planet by six degrees
Celsius above preindustrial averages. A six-degree increase risks
killing most life on earth, as global warming did during the Late
Permian when volcanoes burned a bunch of fossilized carbon (e.g., coal,
oil, and gas). Called the [Great
Dying](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html),
that event was, according to New York Magazine, "The most notorious
\[extinction event...\]; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five
degrees, accelerated when that warming triggered the release of methane
in the Arctic, and ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead."

[Mainstream science
[suggests](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report)
that we're on our way there]{.underline}. During the winter of 2017,
[the Arctic grew warmer than Europe, sending snow to the Mediterranean
and Sahara]{.underline}. The planet may have already passed irreversible
thresholds that could accelerate further feedback loops like permafrost
melt and loss of polar ice. Patches of permafrost [aren't
freezing](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/22/scientists-surprised-arctic-ground-may-not-be-freezingeven-in-winter.html)
even during winter, necessitating a rename (may I suggest 'nevafrost'?).
In the summer of 2018, forests north of the Arctic Circle broke 90
degrees Fahrenheit and
[burned](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/19/europe/sweden-forest-fires-wxc-intl/index.html)
in vast wildfires. [We're reaching milestones far faster than scientists
have even recently predicted]{.underline}. As Guardian columnist George
Monbiot
[noted](https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot/status/968740684114092032),
"[The Arctic meltdown \[...\] is the kind of event scientists warned we
could face by 2050. Not by 2018."]{.underline} [Mass marine death that
rapidly emits uncontrollable greenhouse gasses is another **feedback
loop** that seems ready to strike. The ocean is now [more
acidic](https://phys.org/news/2018-07-ocean-acidification-million-years.html)
than any time in the last 14 million years, killing everything from
snails to whales]{.underline}. [It's growing rapidly more
acidic]{.underline}. Meanwhile, from the global South to wealthier
industrialized countries, [people are **already dying** and being
displaced from the impacts of extreme climate change via extreme
droughts, floods, wildfires, storms, and conflicts like the Syrian civil
war]{.underline}. [Authoritarianism is [on the
rise](https://newrepublic.com/article/148861/climate-change-authoritarian-leaders)
due directly to these climate emergencies and migrations.]{.underline}

[The IPCC has recently alerted the world that we have about a decade to
dramatically cut emissions before collapse becomes
inevitable]{.underline}. [We could prevent human extinction if we act
immediately. But the world is unanimously ignoring climate change.
Nations will almost certainly **fail to avert biosphere collapse**. That
is because doing so will **require a rapid decarbonization** of the
global economy.]{.underline}

But why does decarbonization\--an innocuous enough term\--seem so
implausible? Well, let's put it this way: a sufficient transition to
non-carbon energy would require all the trains, buses, planes, cars, and
ships in the world to almost immediately stop and be replaced with newly
manufactured vehicles to run on non-carbon fuel, like hydrogen cells,
renewable electricity, or some carbon-neutral biofuel. All this new
manufacturing will have to be done with low-carbon techniques, many of
which don't exist yet and may be impossible to achieve at scale. This
means all the complex supply chains that move most of the world's food,
water, medicine, basically all consumer goods, construction materials,
clothing, and everything else billions of people depend on to survive
will have to be fundamentally reformed, in virtually every way,
immediately.  

It also means that all the electric grids and indoor heating and cooling
systems in the world must be rapidly transformed from centralized coal
and gas power plants to a mixture of solar, wind, and nuclear---both
distributed and centralized---dispersed through newly built micro-grids
and smart-grids, and stored in new battery infrastructure. These new
solar panels, batteries, and nuclear plants will somehow have to be
built using little carbon energy, again something that may be impossible
to achieve at a global scale.

The cost of this transition is impossible to know, but surely reaches
the tens of trillions of dollars. It needs to happen in just about every
industrialized nation on the planet and needs to happen now---not in
2050, as the Paris Agreement dictates, or the 2030s, as reflected in
many governments' decarbonization goals. The engineering and
administrative obstacles are immense; disentangling century-old,
haphazard electric grid systems, for example, poses an almost
unimaginable cascade of institutional and logistical hurdles. Imagine
the difficulty of persuading millions of municipalities around the world
to do anything simultaneously; now, imagine convincing them all to
fundamentally shift the resource infrastructure on which their material
existence depends immediately.

Perhaps even more daunting are the political obstacles, [with diverse
financial interests woven together in a tapestry of inertia and
self-interest. Virtually all retirement funds, for instance, are
invested in fossil fuel companies. Former and current fossil fuel
industry managers sit on all manner of institutional committees in which
energy and investment decisions are made: trustee boards of
universities, regulatory commissions, city councils, congressional
committees, philanthropic boards, federal agencies, the Oval Office
couch]{.underline}. Lots of people make lots of money from fossil fuels.
[Will they sacrifice deeply vested interests to prevent
collapse]{.underline}? [They certainly have not shown signs of doing so
yet, when the stakes are as dire as they've ever been; most **have
instead ruthlessly** obstructed meaningful action]{.underline}. Will
enough people be willing to do what it takes to forcibly remove them
from the most powerful institutions in the world? That also seems
unlikely, given meager public involvement in this issue so far.

[This is the obstacle of collective action: everyone has to sacrifice,
but **no one wants to start**]{.underline}. Who will assent to giving up
their steady returns from fossil fuels if everyone else refuses? When
people are living so precariously as it is (43% of American can't afford
basic necessities), how can we ask them to undertake energy transition?
[The US drags its feet on decarbonizing and justifies it by arguing that
China has not made strong enough commitments. Which country will
voluntarily give up access to strategic fossil fuel reserves? Much of
our geopolitical dynamics and **wars have revolved around access** to
mineral resources like oil. Is the US going to put itself in a
disadvantaged position for the climate? Shell withdraws research funding
for renewables because ExxonMobil goes full steam ahead on oil, and,
hey, they must compete. Fossil fuel funded politicians of both parties
certainly **will not aid transition**.]{.underline}

If untangling the webs of influence, interests, and engineering
preventing decarbonization weren't daunting enough, [the world will also
have to suck billions of tons of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere
that have already been emitted]{.underline}. Keeping the planet to even
a deadly 1.5 degrees Celsius increase of warming depends on it.

This sounds simpler than it is, as if a big vacuum cleaner could siphon
particulates from the sky. But no one really knows how to extract and
sequester carbon at the scale necessary to prevent catastrophic climate
change. Engineers have thrown out a lot of ideas---some [more
plausible](https://www.the-trouble.com/content/2018/10/18/avoiding-climate-imperialism-a-leftist-vision-of-geoengineering)
than others---but most scientists who have looked at proposals generally
agree that it's wishful thinking. As Huffington Post
[quotes](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/adnan-aldaini/global-warming-delusions-_b_3175118.html)
Clive Hamilton, "In order to capture just a quarter of the emissions
from the world\'s coal-fired power plants we would need a system of
pipelines that would transport a volume of fluid twice the size of the
global crude-oil industry." Of course, manufacturing, shipping, and
constructing those pipelines would require immense carbon energy inputs
and emissions. And that's just to capture the emissions from coal!

Like energy transition, carbon capture and sequestration requires
governments to act collectively to invest trillions of dollars in risky,
experimental, and probably mostly ineffectual sequestration
technologies. Again, it's a collective action problem: nobody wants to
be the one to sacrifice while no one else is putting themselves on the
line. [And the miniscule likelihood that energy transition will occur

[world](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/01/bolsonaro-environment-agriculture-ministries-amazon)---casts
further doubt on the possibility of rapid decarbonization]{.underline}.
[The administration's energy department has
[projected](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/06022018/eia-trump-greenhouse-gas-emissions-rise-climate-change-natural-gas-wind-solar-energy)
that, "The carbon footprint of the United States will barely go down at
all for the foreseeable future and will be slightly higher in 2050," as
InsideClimateNews notes. The world, today, is still setting records for
carbon emissions and there's no sign that will change anytime
soon.]{.underline}

[The only period in US history the nation has undertaken anything near
the magnitude of **collective action necessary for mitigation** was
during the Second World War and the rebuilding effort in its
aftermath.]{.underline} But even those projects involved a fraction of
the capital and coordination that will be necessary for sufficient
energy transition and carbon sequestration. More importantly, today's
collective action will have to be politically justified without the
motivation of defeating a personified enemy---a Hitler, if you will.
Today, with interpersonal alienation running rampant and extremely
consolidated wealth and power, industrial economies seem infinitely far
from a cultural, political atmosphere in which collective action
policies are even close to possible. [To the contrary, wealthy countries
are all still slashing public goods, passing austerity budgets, and
investing heavily in fossil fuel infrastructure. Even most elected
Democrats are dragging their feet on passing climate policy. The world
is going in the exact opposite direction from one in which humans can
live.]{.underline}

[We've tied ourselves in a perfect Gordian knot.]{.underline}

The global economy is a vast machine, operating beyond the control of
even the most powerful individuals, and it has a will of its own to
consume and pollute. It's hard to believe that this massive metal beast
will be peacefully undone by the people who survive by it, and we all
survive by it in some way, often against our wills; it bribes and
entraps us all in ways large and small.

But a wrench could clog the gears, and maybe only a wrench can stop it.
One wrench that could slow climate disruption may be a large-scale
conflict that halts the global economy, destroys fossil fuel
infrastructure, and throws particulates in the air. At this point, with
~~insane~~ people like Trump, Putin, Xi, May, and Macron leading the
world's biggest nuclear powers, large-scale conflagration between them
would probably lead to a nuclear exchange. Nobody wants nuclear war.
Rather, ~~nobody sane and prosocial wants nuclear war~~. It is an
absolute horror that would burn and maim millions of living beings,
despoil millions of hectares, and scar the skin of the earth and dome of
the sky for centuries, maybe millennia. With proxy conflict brewing
between the US and Russia in the Middle East and the [Thucydides
trap](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/09/the-thucydides-trap/) ready to
ensnare us with an ascendant China, nuclear war looks like a more
realistic possibility than it has since the 1980s.

A devastating fact of climate collapse is that [there may be a s**ilver
lining to the mushroom cloud**.]{.underline} First, [it should be noted
that a nuclear **exchange does not inevitably result** in apocalyptic
loss of life]{.underline}. [Nuclear winter]{.underline}---the idea that
firestorms would make the earth uninhabitable---[is based on shaky
science]{.underline}. There's no reliable model that can determine how
many megatons would decimate agriculture or make humans extinct.
[Nations have already detonated 2,476 nuclear devices.]{.underline}

[An exchange that shuts down the global economy but stops short of human
extinction may be the **only blade realistically likely to cut** the
carbon knot we're trapped within]{.underline}. [It would decimate
existing infrastructures, providing an **opportunity to build new
energy** infrastructure and intervene in the current investments and
subsidies keeping fossil fuels alive.]{.underline}

In the near term, emissions would almost certainly rise as militaries
are some of the world's [largest
emitters](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/01/climate/us-biggest-carbon-polluter-in-history-will-it-walk-away-from-the-paris-climate-deal.html).
Given what we know of human history, though, [conflict may be the **only
way to build the mass social cohesion** necessary for undertaking the
kind of huge, **collective action needed for global sequestration** and
energy transition]{.underline}. Like the 20th century's world wars, [a
nuclear exchange could serve as an economic leveler. It could provide
justification for nationalizing energy industries with the interest of
shuttering fossil fuel plants and transitioning to renewables
and]{.underline}, uh, [nuclear energy]{.underline}. [It could shock us
into **reimagining** a less suicidal civilization, one that **dethrones
the death-cult zealots** who are currently in power]{.underline}. And it
may toss particulates into the atmosphere sufficient to block out some
of the solar heat helping to drive global warming. [[Or it may have the
opposite effects]{.underline}]{.mark}. Who knows?

[What we do know is that humans **can survive** and recover from war,
probably even a nuclear one. Humans **cannot recover** from **runaway
climate change**. Nuclear war is not an inevitable extinction event; six
degrees of warming is.]{.underline}

[Given that mostly violent, psychopathic individuals manage the
governments and industries of the world, it may only be possible for
anti-social collective action---that is, war---to halt, or at least
slow, our inexorable march toward oblivion]{.underline}. A courageous,
benevolent ruler might compel vast numbers of people to collective
action. But we have too few of those, and the legal, political, and
military barriers preventing them from rising are immense. [Our current
crop of villainous presidents, prime ministers, and CEOs, whether
lusting for chaos or pursuing their own petty ends, may inadvertently
conspire to break the machine now preventing our future]{.underline}.
When so bereft of heroes, [we may need to rely on humanity's antagonists
and their petty incompetence to accidentally save the day. It is a stark
reflection of how homicidal our economy is---and our collective
adherence to its whims---that nuclear war could be a **rational course
of action.**]{.underline}

#### Growth and innovation [solve]{.underline} warming.

**Ogutonye, 21**---Policy Lead, Science & Innovation Unit, Tony Blair
Institute for Global Change (Olamide, "Should Tech Make Us Optimistic
About Climate Change?,"
<https://institute.global/policy/should-tech-make-us-optimistic-about-climate-change>,
dml)

In the middle of a climate emergency, it is challenging to stay upbeat.
Yet the good news is that [investment in climate technology has
**continued to grow**]{.underline} since the early 2010s. US-listed
[companies involved with providing technology solutions that support
global decarbonisation have **consistently outperformed** the
average]{.underline} since 2019 (Figure 7). Venture capital
([VC]{.underline}) [investment]{.underline} in the sector [grew
**tenfold**]{.underline} between 2013 and 2018, representing five times
the growth rate of the overall VC market. By comparison, the growth rate
of VC investment in Artificial Intelligence was a third of climate tech
between 2013 and 2018 although AI is renowned for its uptick within the
same timeframe. Beyond VC, [**public investment** in climate technology
research has continued to grow]{.underline} too. [In 2019]{.underline},
[government]{.underline} [r]{.underline}esearch [and]{.underline}
[d]{.underline}evelopment [funding for energy technologies alone stood
at **\$30 billion**]{.underline}, with around 80 per cent of it aimed at
low-carbon solutions.

In addition to the positive role of technology, [political leaders are
**increasingly showing** a willingness to make **ambitious commitments**
on climate]{.underline}. The **[Paris]{.underline}** Agreement is a case
in point. The international treaty [was]{.underline} adopted in 2015 and
[ratified internationally within a **year**]{.underline} -- a **[much
quicker]{.underline}** pace [than]{.underline} its predecessor, the
**[Kyoto]{.underline}** Protocol, which took eight years. The
[Paris]{.underline} deal [grew into a **political
snowball**]{.underline}, [**galvanising further commitment** from most
of the world's leading emitters]{.underline} and arguably becoming the
most symbolic climate event of the 21st century. [The US
withdrawal]{.underline} from the Paris Agreement in 2019 dealt a
political blow to the global pact although the decision, since reversed
by President Biden, [**did not resonate** or **last long enough** to
have any major impact]{.underline}.

The [Biden-Harris]{.underline} administration [has]{.underline} already
[indicated that it **will not sit on the fence** but will instead
**revive** the country's leadership on climate action]{.underline}. [In
the **UK** and **elsewhere**]{.underline}, [**similar efforts** can be
observed as more countries commit to some form of **net zero
target**]{.underline}. [**More than 100 countries** have pledged a
commitment towards net zero]{.underline}, with estimates suggesting that
[**over 70 per cent** of global GDP and **55 per cent** of CO2 emissions
are now covered by a similar target]{.underline}. A Climate Action
Tracker Report indicates that [the **cumulative effect** of countries'
pledges]{.underline} to the Paris Agreement -- if kept and fully
achieved -- [could **keep**]{.underline} global temperature rise below
2.1°C by 2100, putting the stated goal of **[1.5°C within striking
distance]{.underline}**.

As explored in our recent Institute paper, there are also important
insights for politicians in terms of applying lessons from the Covid-19
pandemic to the climate emergency. Although the pandemic is different in
scale, complexity and timeline, it offers an immediate window into how
policy leaders can adapt and make decisions in order to better support
climate innovation. Countries can also apply the "recovering better
together" principles outlined by the UN, which calls for a commitment to
climate-related actions as economies recover from the Covid-19 slowdown.
**[More than 60 countries]{.underline}**, [including **high
emitters**]{.underline}, [are already making an **explicit promise** to
link their]{.underline} nationally determined contributions
(**[NDC]{.underline}**) [to **Covid-19 recovery**]{.underline},
supported by the United Nations Development Programme's Climate Promise
programme. [Countries in the Global South are **equally** aligning their
climate mission with]{.underline} international support for various [NDC
support programmes]{.underline}. [A green recovery can **cut** the level
of 2030 emissions to **25 per cent lower** than projections based on
pre-Covid commitments]{.underline} and put the world close to a 2°C
pathway. The pandemic has also highlighted the significance of tech
innovation, not least in record-breaking vaccine delivery but also in
the suite of digital solutions developed for contact tracing, compliance
monitoring and management of health-care records.

[The global financial landscape is **evolving** to become more
responsive to climate innovation]{.underline}. Since they were first
issued in 2007, [**green bonds** have grown into]{.underline} what is
now estimated to become [a **\$1 trillion market**]{.underline}.
Analysts expect as much as \$500 billion of green bonds this year as the
EU raises capital for its Covid recovery fund. From target-linked to
transition bonds, [innovations in this green market are being used to
bring projects in **energy**]{.underline}, **[transport]{.underline}**,
[**buildings** and **other economic sectors** to life]{.underline}.
[Investor-led initiatives]{.underline} such as Climate Action 100+,
whose members control over \$50 trillion of assets, [are actively using
funds to **ensure** the world's largest corporate greenhouse gas
emitters **commit** to climate action]{.underline}. [Other investor
networks are pursuing a similar agenda]{.underline}, including Europe's
Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) and Australia
and New Zealand's Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC). [Humanity's
competence in technology and innovation will be **central** to the race
in mitigating and tackling climate change]{.underline}.

#### The [overall]{.underline} environment is [resilient]{.underline}\-\--'existential' threats are [false]{.underline}

Ronald **Bailey 20**, Science Correspondent at Reason, Member of the
Society of Environmental Journalists and the American Society for
Bioethics and Humanities, "The Global Environmental Apocalypse Has Been
Canceled", Reason Magazine, 8/1/2020,
<https://reason.com/2020/08/01/the-global-environmental-apocalypse-has-been-canceled/>
\[grammar edit\]

[According to]{.underline} these [activists]{.underline} and
politicians, [humanity is beset on all sides by catastrophes that could
**kill off civilization**]{.underline}, and maybe even our species. [Are
they right?]{.underline}

Absolutely not, answers the longtime environmental activist Michael
Shellenberger in an engaging new book, Apocalypse Never: Why
Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All. \"[Much of what people are being
told about the environment]{.underline}, including the climate, [is
**wrong**]{.underline}, and we desperately need to get it right,\" he
writes. \"I decided to write Apocalypse Never after getting fed up with
[the **exaggeration**, **alarmism**]{.underline}, and extremism that
[are the enemy of]{.underline} positive, humanistic, and [rational
environmentalism]{.underline}.\" While fully acknowledging that
significant global **[environmental problems]{.underline}** exist,
Shellenberger argues that they **[do not constitute inexorable
existential threats]{.underline}**. Economic [growth and
**tech**]{.underline}nological [progress]{.underline}, he says, [can
ameliorate them]{.underline}.

Shellenberger\'s analysis relies on largely uncontroversial mainstream
science, including reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) and the Food and Agriculture Organization. And as a
longstanding activist, Shellenberger is in a good position to parse the
motives behind the purveyors of doom.

Shellenberger\'s activism is the real deal. To raise a donation to the
Rainforest Action Network, he charged his friends \$5 to attend his 16th
birthday party. At 17 he went to Nicaragua to experience the Sandinista
revolution. In the 1990s he worked with the Landless Workers\' Movement
in Brazil.

In 2003, Shellenberger and allies launched the New Apollo Project to
jumpstart a no-carbon energy revolution over the next 10 years. In 2008,
Time named him \"A Hero of the Environment.\" He co-founded the
ecomodernist Breakthrough Institute, which advocates the use of advanced
technologies such as nuclear power and agricultural biotechnology to
decouple the economy from the ecology, allowing both humanity and the
natural world to flourish. More recently, he founded Environmental
Progress, which campaigns for, among other things, the deployment of
clean modern nuclear power. He is an invited expert reviewer of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\'s next assessment report.

Ohio Passes Controversial Conscience Clause for Doctors

So what does he say about climate change? \"On behalf of
environmentalists everywhere, I would like to formally apologize for the
climate scare we created over the last 30 years,\" he wrote in an essay
to promote his new book. \"[Climate change is happening. It\'s just
**not the end of the world**]{.underline}. It\'s not even our most
serious environmental problem.\" Needless to say, there are
environmentalists everywhere who do not believe they have anything to
apologize for. A group of six researchers assembled by the widely
respected Climate Feedback fact-checking consortium rated his article as
having low scientific credibility.

Shellenberger doesn\'t devote much of Apocalypse Never to the science
behind man-made climate change. He basically accepts the consensus that
it\'s a significant problem and instead focuses on various claims about
the harms it is supposedly already causing. In that promotional essay,
he argues that (1) [human\[s\] being are **not** causing a **\"sixth
mass extinction,\"**]{.underline} (2) [the Amazon rainforests are not
the \"lungs of the world,\"]{.underline} (3) [climate change is not
making natural disasters worse, and]{.underline} (4) [fires have
declined 25 percent around the world since 2003]{.underline}.

Shellenberger isn\'t denying the reality of man-made climate change.
He\'s arguing that [humanity is **already adapting** to the ways climate
change has been making weather patterns evolve, and that we **will
continue** to adapt successfully in the future]{.underline}. His book is
ultimately a sustained argument that poverty is world\'s most important
environmental problem, and that [rising **prosperity** and increasing
**technological prowess** will]{.underline} ameliorate or [**reverse**
most deleterious environmental trends]{.underline}.

### 2AC\-\--AT: AI

#### AI won't cause extinction 

**Shermer '17** \[Michael; April; Publisher of Skeptic magazine, a
monthly columnist for Scientific American, and a Presidential Fellow at
Chapman University; "Why Artificial Intelligence Is Not an Existential
Threat," Skeptic, vol. 22, no. 2, pp. 29--35\]

Why AI is not an Existential Threat First, [most AI doomsday prophecies
are grounded in the]{.underline} **[false analogy]{.underline}**
[between]{.underline} **[human nature]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
[**computer nature**, or natural intelligence and artificial
intelligence. We are thinking machines, but natural selection also
designed into us]{.underline} **[emotions]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[shortcut]{.underline}** the
**[thinking]{.underline}** process because natural intelligences are
limited in speed and capacity by the number of neurons that can be
crammed into a skull that has to pass through a pelvic opening at birth,
whereas artificial intelligence need not be so restricted. We don\'t
need to compute the caloric value of foods, for example, we just feel
hungry. We don\'t need to calculate the waist-to-hip ratio of women or
the shoulder-to-waist ratio of men in our quest for genetically healthy
potential mates; we just feel attracted to someone and mate with them.
We don\'t need to work out the genetic cost of raising someone else\'s
offspring if our mate is unfaithful; we just feel jealous. We don\'t
need to figure the damage of an unfair or non-reciprocal exchange with
someone else; we just feel injustice and desire revenge. [Emotions
are]{.underline} **[proxies]{.underline}** [for getting us to
act]{.underline} in ways that lead to an increase in reproductive
success, particularly [in response to threats]{.underline} faced by our
Paleolithic ancestors. Anger leads us to strike out, fight back, and
defend ourselves against danger. Fear causes us to pull back, retreat,
and escape from risks. Disgust directs us to push out, eject, and expel
that which is bad for us. [Computing the odds of danger in any given
situation takes too long. We need to]{.underline} **[react
instantly]{.underline}**. Emotions shortcut the information processing
power needed by brains that would otherwise become bogged down with all
the computations necessary for survival. [Their purpose, in an ultimate
causal sense, is to drive behaviors toward goals selected by evolution
to]{.underline} **[enhance survival]{.underline}** and reproduction.
**[AIs]{.underline}** \-- even AGIs and ASIs \-- [will have]{.underline}
**[no need]{.underline}** [of such emotions]{.underline} and so there
would be no reason to program them in unless, say, terrorists chose to
do so for their own evil purposes. But that\'s a human nature problem,
not a computer nature issue. [To believe that an ASI would
be]{.underline} **[\"evil\"]{.underline}** in any emotional sense [is to
assume a computer cognition that includes such psychological traits
as]{.underline} [**acquisitiveness**, competitiveness, vengeance, and
bellicosity, which seem to be projections coming from the
mostly]{.underline} **[male writers]{.underline}** [who]{.underline}
**[concoct]{.underline}** such [**dystopias**, not features any
**programmer**]{.underline} [would]{.underline} [**bother including**,
assuming that it]{.underline} [**could even be done**. What would it
mean to program an emotion into a computer? When IBM\'s Deep Blue
defeated chess master Garry Kasparov]{.underline} in 1997, [did it feel
**triumphant**]{.underline}, vengeful, or bellicose? [**Of course not**.
It **wasn\'t even \"aware\"**]{.underline} [\-- in the human sense of
self-conscious knowledge \-- that it was]{.underline} [**playing
chess**, much less feeling nervous about possibly losing]{.underline} to
the reigning world champion (which it did in the first tournament played
in 1996). In fact, toward the end of the first game of the second
tournament, on the 44th move, Deep Blue made a legal but
incomprehensible move of pushing its rook all the way to the last row of
the opposition side. It accomplished nothing offensively or defensively,
leading Kasparov to puzzle over it out of concern that he was missing
something in the computer\'s strategy. It turned out to be an error in
Deep Blue\'s programming that led to this fail-safe default move. It was
a bug that Kasparov mistook as a feature, and as a result some chess
experts contend it led him to be less confident in his strategizing and
to second-guess his responses in the subsequent games. It even led him
to suspect foul play and human intervention behind Deep Blue, and this
paranoia ultimately cost him the tournamentt.\[ 13\] Computers don\'t
get paranoid, the HAL 9000 computer in 2001 notwithstanding. [Or
consider **Watson**]{.underline}, the IBM computer built by David
Ferrucci and his team of IBM research scientists tasked with designing
an AI that could rival human champions at the game of Jeopardy! This was
a far more formidable challenge than Deep Blue faced because of the
prerequisite to understand language and the often multiple meanings of
words, not to mention needing an encyclopedic knowledge of trivia
(Watson had access to Wikipedia for this). After beating the all-time
greatest Jeopardy! champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in 2011, did
Watson feel flushed with pride after its victory? Did Watson even know
that it won Jeopardy!? I put the question to none other than Ferrucci
himself at a dinner party in New York in conjunction with the 2011
Singularity Summit. His answer surprised me: \"Yes, [Watson knows it won
Jeopardy!]{.underline}\" I was skeptical. How could that be, since such
self-awareness is not yet possible in computers? \"[Because]{.underline}
**[I told it]{.underline}** that it won,\" he replied with a wry smile.
Sure, and you could even program Watson or Deep Blue to vocalize a
Howard Dean-like victory scream when it wins, but that is [still
a]{.underline} **[far cry]{.underline}** [from a computer feeling
triumphant]{.underline}. [This brings to mind the **\"hard problem\" of
consciousness**]{.underline} [\-- if we don\'t understand how this
happens in humans,]{.underline} **[how could we program it into
computers?]{.underline}** As Steven Pinker elucidated in his answer to
the 2015 Edge Question on what to think about machines that think, [\"AI
dystopias project a]{.underline} **[parochial alpha-male
psychology]{.underline}** [onto the]{.underline} [**concept of
intelligence**. They assume that superhumanly intelligent robots would
develop **goals** like **deposing their masters**]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} **[taking over the world.\"]{.underline}** [It
is]{.underline} **[equally possible]{.underline}**, Pinker suggests,
[that \"artificial intelligence will naturally develop
along]{.underline} female [lines]{.underline}: fully capable of solving
problems, but [with]{.underline} **[no desire to annihilate
innocents]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[dominate the
civilization]{.underline}**.\"\[ 14\] So [the fear that computers will
become emotionally evil are unfounded, because without the suite of
these evolved emotions it will]{.underline} **[never occur to
AIs]{.underline}** [to take such actions against us]{.underline}. [What
about an ASI **inadvertently**]{.underline} [causing]{.underline} our
[extinction]{.underline} by turning us into paperclips, or tiling the
entire Earth\'s surface with solar panels? [Such scenarios imply yet
another emotion \-- the feeling of]{.underline}
**[valuing]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[wanting
something]{.underline}**. As the science writer Michael Chorost adroitly
notes, [when humans resist an AI from undertaking any form of global
tiling, it \"will have to be able to]{.underline} **[imagine
counteractions]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**want to carry them
out**.\" Yet, \"until an AI has feelings, it\'s going to be unable
to]{.underline} [**want to do anything at all**, let alone **act counter
to humanity\'s interests**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[fight off
human resistance]{.underline}**.\" Further, Chorost notes, \"the minute
an A.I. wants anything, it will live in a universe with rewards and
punishments \-- including punishments from us for behaving badly. In
order [to survive in a world dominated by humans, a nascent A.I. will
have to develop a humanlike moral sense that certain things are right
and others are wrong. By the time it\'s in a position to **imagine**
tiling the Earth with solar panels, it\'ll **know that it would be
morally wrong**]{.underline} to do so.\"\[ 15\] From here Chorost builds
on an argument made by Peter Singer in The Expanding Circle (and Steven
Pinker in The Better Angels of Our Nature\[ 16\] that I also developed
in The Moral Arc\[ 17\] and Robert Wright explored in Nonzero\[ 18\]),
and that is the propensity for natural intelligence to evolve moral
emotions that include reciprocity, cooperativeness, and even altruism.
Natural intelligences such as ours also includes the capacity to reason,
and once you are on Singer\'s metaphor of the \"escalator of reason\" it
can carry you upward to genuine morality and concerns about harming
others. \"Reasoning is inherently expansionist. It seeks universal
application,\" Singer notes.\[ 19\] Chorost draws the implication:
\"[AIs will have to step on the escalator of reason just like humans
have, because they will need to]{.underline} **[bargain for goods in a
human-dominated economy]{.underline}** [and they will face **human
resistance to bad behavior**]{.underline}.\"\[ 20\] Finally, [for an AI
to get around this problem it would need to evolve emotions on its own,
but the only way for this to happen in a world dominated by the natural
intelligence called humans would be for]{.underline}
**[us]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [**allow it to happen**, which we
**wouldn\'t**]{.underline} [because there\'s]{.underline} [**time enough
to see it coming**. Bostrom\'s \"treacherous turn\" will come
with]{.underline} **[road signs ahead]{.underline}** warning us that
there\'s a sharp bend in the highway with enough time for us to grab the
wheel. [Incremental progress is what we see in most technologies,
including and especially AI, which will continue to serve us in **the
manner we desire and need**]{.underline}. Instead of Great Leap Forward
or Giant Fall Backward, think Small Steps Upward. As I proposed in The
Moral Arc, [instead of Utopia or dystopia, think]{.underline}
**[protopia]{.underline}**, a term coined by the futurist Kevin Kelly,
who described it in an Edge conversation this way: \"I call myself a
protopian, not a Utopian. I believe in progress in an incremental way
where every year it\'s better than the year before but not by very much
\-- just a micro amount.\"\[ 21\] Almost all progress in science and
technology, including computers and AI, is of a protopian nature.
Rarely, if ever, do technologies lead to either Utopian or dystopian
societies. Pinker agrees that [there is]{.underline} **[plenty of
time]{.underline}** [to plan for all conceivable contingencies and build
safeguards into our AI systems. \"They would not need any ponderous
\'rules of robotics\' or some newfangled **moral
philosophy**]{.underline} [to do this, just the same]{.underline}
**[common sense]{.underline}** [that went into the design
of]{.underline} **[food processors]{.underline}**, **[table
saws]{.underline}**, **[space heaters]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[automobiles]{.underline}**.\" [Sure, an ASI would be many orders of
magnitude]{.underline} **[smarter]{.underline}** [than
these]{.underline} machines, [but Pinker reminds us of the]{.underline}
**[AI hyperbole]{.underline}** [we\'ve been fed for decades: \"The worry
that an AI system would be **so clever**]{.underline} at attaining one
of the goals programmed into it (like commandeering energy) [that it
would **run roughshod over**]{.underline} the **[others]{.underline}**
(like human safety) [assumes that AI will descend upon us **faster than
we can design fail-safe precautions**. The reality is that progress in
AI is]{.underline} [**hype-defyingly slow**, and there will be plenty of
time for feedback from incremental implementations, with humans wielding
the screwdriver at every stage.\"]{.underline}\[ 22\] Former Google CEO
Eric Schmidt agrees, responding to the fears expressed by Hawking and
Musk this way: [\"Don\'t you think the humans would notice this, and
start **turning off the computers**?\"]{.underline} He also noted the
irony in the fact that Musk has invested \$1 billion into a company
called OpenAI that is \"promoting precisely AI of the kind we are
describing.\"\[ 23\] [Google\'s own DeepMind has developed the concept
of an **AI off-switch**, playfully described as a **\"big red
button\"**]{.underline} to be pushed in the event of an attempted AI
takeover. \"We have proposed a framework to allow a human operator to
repeatedly safely interrupt a reinforcement learning agent while making
sure the agent will not learn to prevent or induce these
interruptions,\" write the authors Laurent Orseau from DeepMind and
Stuart Armstrong from the Future of Humanity Institute, in a paper
titled \"Safely Interruptible Agents.\" They even suggest a
precautionary scheduled shutdown every night at 2 AM for an hour so that
both humans and AI are accustomed to the idea. [\"Safe interruptibility
can be useful to take control of a robot that is
misbehaving]{.underline} and may lead to irreversible consequences, or
to take it out of a delicate situation, or even to temporarily use it to
achieve a task it did not learn to perform or would not normally receive
rewards for this.\"\[ 24\] [As well, it is good to keep in mind that
artificial intelligence is not the same as artificial **consciousness**.
Thinking machines **may not be sentient**]{.underline} machines.
Finally, Andrew Ng of Baidu responded to Elon Musk\'s ASI concerns by
noting (in a jab at the entrepreneur\'s ambitions for colonizing the red
planet) it would be \"like worrying about overpopulation on Mars when we
have not even set foot on the planet yet.\"\[ 25\] Both Utopian and
dystopian visions of AI are based on a projection of the future quite
unlike anything history has given us. Yet, even Ray Kurzweil\'s \"law of
accelerating returns,\" as remarkable as it has been has nevertheless
advanced at a pace that has allowed for considerable ethical
deliberation with appropriate checks and balances applied to various
technologies along the way. With time, [even if an unforeseen motive
somehow began to emerge in an AI we would have the **time to reprogram
it** before it got out of control]{.underline}. That is also the
judgment of Alan Winfield, an engineering professor and co-author of the
Principles of Robotics, a list of rules for regulating robots in the
real world that goes far beyond Isaac Asimov\'s famous three laws of
robotics (which were, in any case, designed to fail as plot devices for
science fictional narratives).26 Winfield points out that
[all]{.underline} of these [doomsday scenarios depend on a]{.underline}
**[long sequence of big ifs]{.underline}** [to unroll
sequentially:]{.underline} \"If we succeed in building human equivalent
AI and if that AI acquires a full understanding of how it works, and if
it then succeeds in improving itself to produce super-intelligent AI,
and if that super-AI, accidentally or maliciously, starts to consume
resources, and if we fail to pull the plug, then, yes, we may well have
a problem. [The risk, while not impossible, is
**improbable**]{.underline}.\"\[ 27

In order to avoid unnecessary academic discussion of unlikely
hypotheticals for the purpose of pure academic interest, [this article
proceeds with two important limitations on the premise upon which the
analysis is developed: technological feasibility (at least in a
foreseeable future) and practical utility. There are many wild
speculations about what nanotechnology may enable us to
produce]{.underline}---such as autonomous, self-replicating
["nano-bots"]{.underline} (nano-scale machines) and [micro-fusion
nuclear weapons]{.underline}--- however, [it is doubtful whether these
are technologically feasible]{.underline} within the period addressed in
this article. 9 Scientists are indeed working towards miniaturization of
unmanned aerial vehicles, as demonstrated by the United States' Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency's "nano air vehicles" program,10 yet
[further miniaturization to micro- or nano-sized robots is at least a
few decades away]{.underline}. The development of artificial
intelligence is making parallel progress, yet [it will take decades
before autonomous weapon systems will be capable of compliance with
targeting law requirements]{.underline},11 [and even longer]{.underline}
for it [to be miniaturized to a size that is sufficiently small to be
installed on "nano-bots"]{.underline} to enable their autonomous
operation [Even if these were technologically feasible]{.underline}
options, the actual [employment of those weapons]{.underline} in the way
that commentators are speculating [may not be practically
viable]{.underline}. For example, weaponization of artificial
intelligence with the capacity to operate beyond pre-programmed
parameters through autonomous learning now appears to be feasible. 12
However, [employing autonomous weapon system]{.underline}s that
independently operate beyond pre-programmed parameters [may not
practically serve the interest of the commanders, who would rather use
them to gather high fidelity information]{.underline} in order to permit
reassessment of constantly changing situations, and [in a manner that
ensures they operate exactly as commanders direct]{.underline} to
support the achievement of specific military objectives.
