4.3. External action

We are today witnessing a return to a more realist vision of the world,
driven by geopolitical considerations, where global and even regional
powers try to maximise their weight and challenge the established
international order using both \'soft\' and \'hard\' power tools. [The
EU and the Member States are **committed to multilateralism**, in a
world where some actors are beginning to reject it]{.underline}. This
gives greater value to the EU\'s action in support of multilateralism, a
concept that remains key to world peace and security. [The EU must
continue to rely on a wide range of \'soft power\' tools -- crisis
management, sanctions, development or trade -- that need to be
strengthened.]{.underline} However, in order to be able to stand up for
its values and interests in the world, the EU also needs to develop
\'hard power\' tools. [Only through a mix of \'soft\' and \'hard power\'
tools would the EU be able to act autonomously at any given
time]{.underline}.

4.3.1. [A renewed approach to multilateralism]{.underline}

Multilateralism and the rules-based order were challenged even before
the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.73 Recent years have been marked
by the waning commitment of major countries to multilateralism, an issue
which is of major concern to the EU.74 In the area of security, this,
among other things, is jeopardising the survival of important nuclear
arms-control treaties, with potentially direct implications for Europe.
The unilateral withdrawal of the United States from the JCPOA, a
landmark agreement to ensure the peaceful nature of Iran\'s nuclear
programme, over allegations that Iran was violating the spirit of the
agreement, and the February 2019 announcement that both the USA and
Russia would suspend their obligations under the 1987 Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, are cases in point. The INF eliminated and
prohibited ground-launched intermediate ballistic and cruise missiles
with ranges between 500 and 5 500 km; its suspension leaves Europe
potentially exposed to Russian intimidation.75 More recently, the USA
announced its withdrawal from the Open Skies Treaty, which permits
unarmed observation aircraft to fly over the territories of its parties
to observe military forces and activities, increasing trust and
transparency. 76 However, the crisis of multilateralism extends beyond
traditional notions of security, with the USA having also withdrawn from
the landmark agreement on climate change, the Paris Agreement, the
United Nations Human Rights Council and, in May 2020 announcing its
withdrawal from the World Health Organization in mid-pandemic. Beyond
the world\'s major power\'s policy changes, the crisis of
multilateralism is embodied in challenges faced by some of the most
established international organisations, most notably the World Trade
Organization, as multilateral consensus becomes harder to reach. As UN
Secretary-General António Guterres emphasised to the UN Security Council
the observed rise in nationalism and protectionism is having detrimental
effects for transnational trust and multilateralism.

[For the EU, the promotion and **protection** of the **multilateral
rules-based order** is a **fundamental goal** of its external
action]{.underline}. [**Multilateralism** lies at the **core of the
EU\'s identity**, and of its strategy to promote its values and defend
its interests.]{.underline} In the words of the former HR/VP Federica
Mogherini: \'...we achieved security through cooperation. We built peace
with multilateralism. \[...\] This is the strength of the European Union
experience\'. As an example of multilateral cooperation itself, the
Treaty on European Union stipulates that the EU \'shall promote
multilateral solutions to common problems, in particular in the
framework of the United Nations\' whenever possible (Article 20(1) TEU).
The first ever comprehensive European Security Strategy (ESS) --
formulated in 2003 -- made \'strengthening the United Nations, equipping
it to fulfil its responsibilities and to act effectively\' a European
priority and placed advocacy of \'effective multilateralism\' at the
centre of the EU\'s strategic goals. The 2016 EU Global Strategy
reiterates the EU\'s dedication to the promotion of \'a rules-based
global order with multilateralism as its key principle and the United
Nations at its core\'. [At the same time, it emphasises that \'the
format to deliver **effective global governance** may vary from case to
case\', citing policy areas ranging from cybersecurity (where states,
international organisations, industry, civil society and technical
experts are actors to consider) and maritime policy]{.underline} (the
UN, UN specialised agencies, NATO, strategic partners, and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)), to humanitarian,
development and climate policy (the UN, G20, new donors, civil society
and the private sector). [Where multilateral processes already exist,
the strategy envisions strengthening them, and at the same time
expanding fledgling international regimes in areas such as disarmament
and international criminal law. 77 **Biodiversity** and **artificial
intelligence** are also areas where nascent formats of **multilateral
governance** can be observed.]{.underline}

[Importantly, the EU Global Strategy acknowledged the need to **reform
multilateral structures** and to **address their weaknesses**, while at
the same time bolstering the spirit and practise of multilateral
cooperation]{.underline}. It [follows that for the EU, **strategic
autonomy** is synonymous with a greater capacity to defend a principled
commitment to multilateralism, rather than the aspiration to act
unilaterally.]{.underline} The efforts to [**bolster the EU\'s
credibility** as a geopolitical actor with strategic autonomy should be
seen as **prerequisites** **to sustain multilateralism** as a
constitutive principle of \'a renewed vision of international order that
is suited to today\'s world]{.underline}\' -- a world, in which the
[**US-led liberal order**, that encouraged multilateral cooperation on
issues ranging from security to trade, is in **crisis**]{.underline}. 78
[In the wake of major geopolitical and geo-economic shifts, countries
like the USA or UK, who have done much to construct this post-war
international order,79 have quit multilateral formats, while competing
powers may seek to weaponise them]{.underline}. [This complex situation,
where multilateralism is thwarted and contested80 can represent an
**opportunity for European influence** in the context of strategic
autonomy]{.underline}. [**Despite internal divisions and structural
problems, \'the EU remains the most consistent and best-resourced
supporter of a strong multilateral system in the world today\'**. A
**united EU,** defining and pursuing its strategic interests, **can work
towards a renewed approach to multilateralism** as an alternative
European model of global cooperation vis-à-vis American and Chinese
leadership.81]{.underline}

In her political guidelines, Commission President von der Leyen
highlighted the intention to \'uphold and update the rules based global
order\' through assertiveness and a strategic approach, with the Union
using its normative power to uphold multilateral decisions in both trade
and climate through its own legislation. Furthermore, within its
\'stronger Europe in the world\' priority, the Commission already
announced its intention to launch an initiative on WTO reform in the
context of the trade policy review planned for the fourth quarter of
2020.

[The coronavirus pandemic has arguably been considered a wake-up call
for multilateralism, and experts have suggested that it will provide the
necessary push for much-needed reform and reinvigoration of multilateral
cooperation]{.underline}. As a 2019 European Parliament report on the
implementation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP)states,
it is for Europe to defend multilateralism and international law. In the
wake of the pandemic, in a hearing at the SEDE subcommittee, HR/VP
Borrell stated that: [**\'The world has never needed multilateral and
cross-border cooperation so much**, but unfortunately we do not have
enough of it\'. **A strategic and autonomous EU would be able to
leverage the partnerships needed in this effort**. As Parliament has
stressed, \'the EU should switch from a responsive to an anticipatory
approach and the importance of teaming up with like-minded EU strategic
partners, in particular NATO and emerging countries, in order to defend
the global rule-based order that is founded on international and
humanitarian law and multilateral treaties\'.]{.underline}

[Future of SSA/STM]{.underline}

[While SSA/STM has]{.underline} [traditionally sat within a
military]{.underline} setting, particularly in the [US]{.underline}, in
[recent years]{.underline} [it has become associated with a more diverse
set of providers]{.underline}. [Private companies]{.underline} now
supply commercial data to operators. This change has also been
recognized at government level. In June 2018, President Trump signed
Space Policy Directive-3, which proposes to shift the responsibility for
providing SSA data to satellite operators from the DoD to the Department
of Commerce (DoC).28 [The DoC]{.underline} [would]{.underline} therefore
[be responsible for handling the information warning satellite operators
of potential collisions.]{.underline} There are [a number of
benefits]{.underline} that [could be felt]{.underline} [from this change
in policy]{.underline}. [First]{.underline}, [it will allow the DoD to
focus its efforts on national]{.underline} [security considerations and
not deal with the increasing day-to-day activities]{.underline}
resulting [from]{.underline} the rising number of [satellites and
operators]{.underline}. [Second]{.underline}, [this move creates an
opportunity for the DoC to engage with international
partners]{.underline} [in a way that the DoD was unable to]{.underline}
as the data will no longer be behind a military firewall and it has a
commercial focus, [which alters the opportunity landscape for the
EU.]{.underline}

The difficulty in understanding exactly what the impact of this move
will be on international STM cooperation is that there is still no firm
decision as to how this will be organized in the US. While the proposal
is for the work to move to the DoC, the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) is also fighting for the authority over civil STM, and the debate
over which organization will ultimately be successful is still
ongoing.29 Either way, it is unlikely that the DoD will continue to be
the main point of contact for STM data. It is also important to
recognize the difficulties that could arise during the
military-to-civilian transition, particularly in terms of communication
and continuity of service over an extended transition period.

[Over the next few years there is likely to be an increase in SSA/STM
activities by states that are beginning to play a major role in space,
whether through the number of satellites in orbit and/or through
commercial launch services.]{.underline} An example of such a state is
India. In February 2017, India launched 104 satellites on the Indian
Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) Polar Satellite Launch vehicle,30
and as a result it is now one of the leaders in the provision of
commercial space launches. It is essential that India and other states
entering this arena are included in global SSA efforts and acting
responsibly. [There are **opportunities for Europe** to lead in engaging
with these actors]{.underline}. [Commercial companies operating in this
sphere will also continue to grow]{.underline}. [Many]{.underline} of
these [will be looking to increase their geographical coverage to ensure
their data is as accurate as possible and could look to partner with
European states or companies. The **EU could foster an environment**
that makes such cooperation easy]{.underline}, [partnering with both
other states and commercial providers to **supply more comprehensive
SSA**]{.underline}. While a European ambition to further SSA cooperation
with the US is welcome, this should not be seen in isolation or to the
detriment of a move towards a more global coalition of SSA providers.
[With the **US potentially less willing** to explore partnership
agreements, the **EU could act** as an intermediary and **driver of
political will for further international cooperation.**]{.underline}

Scenarios for [EU--US cooperation]{.underline}

[The broad landscape of **SSA activities** and their importance for
**orbital sustainability**,]{.underline} as well as the changing
operators and policy, [mean that there are a **number of opportunities
for EU--US cooperation,** and for the **EU to increase its
capabilities** and become a key player in leading the responsible use of
space.]{.underline}

[The one area in which potential opportunities will be very]{.underline}
**limited**[, if not impossible, is **military SSA
activities**]{.underline}. International involvement in the US CSpOC is
limited to the UK, Canada and Australia, all members of the Five Eyes
community, as well as France and Germany. Any possible involvement of
additional European countries would only occur as the result of a larger
intelligence and information sharing partnership, although US Air Force
Chief of Staff General David Goldfein has stated that he expects the
CSpOC to continue to grow.**31** [The EU should therefore focus on the
civilian aspects of SSA and the changing landscape of
providers.]{.underline}

It has been suggested by a number of experts that [SSA needs to become a
civil mission with the military augmenting and supporting national
security programmes as their mission]{.underline}. [That will need a
significant shift in US operations (which is happening slowly) and a
**greater sharing of data**]{.underline}. **[Data integrity and data
trust are essential]{.underline}**. [The concept of the **EU SST** as a
civil programme should provide the **required momentum** to help with
this **paradigm shift.**]{.underline} However, some important issuesneed
to be addressed to support this. First, the civil programme should be
the primary goal. Second, EU funds need to be focused on developing
sensors, capabilities and experience that complements and contributes to
existing activities rather than replicating what is currently available.
For Europe that means not spreading funds and resources across a number
of countries but focusing on only one or two to support the rest of
Europe. Third, [sensors dedicated to STM are essential, as one of the
difficulties in space tracking for the military is that many of its
sensors are primarily focused on missile defence. Fourth, **cooperation
among EU contributors** needs to improve and this must be rectified
before Europe can provide an **effective support mechanism for global
SSA**]{.underline}. As a multilateral organization, the EU SST framework
also comes with its own set of challenges in cooperation and information
integration between member states. It can look to the EU Satellite
Centre (Satcen)32 in Torrejon, Spain, as an example of understanding and
dealing with the sensitive nature of aggregating national derived data
and distributing it among EU member states

Nevertheless, [the **EU's tradition of support for openness** and civil
society means that it is **well placed to fill the gaps** in the other
extant SSA systems by being independent, **open and free** at the point
of service.]{.underline} [An EU-led open system, with the option for
other providers to feed in their data if they wanted to]{.underline},
could rapidly supersede the US SATCAT as the system of choice by virtue
of its open availability, and with relatively modest investment. [Such a
system could also be best placed to **increase international
cooperation** with countries such as Japan and India as well as smaller
countries looking to responsibly operate their limited assets and
**contribute to broader space sustainability**]{.underline}. [The EU can
also look to support and promote initiatives]{.underline} such as the
Space Data Association (SDA)33 and the DARPA-led Consortium for
Execution of Rendezvous and Servicing Operations (CONFERS),34 [which
provide forums for international operators to **exchange data** and
**cooperate to avoid collisions**.]{.underline}

One question that Europe needs to address is cooperation with the UK
following Brexit. There should still be opportunities to collaborate
between the EU and the UK. One aspect that needs to be looked at is any
potential UK involvement in the EU SST programme. In whatever way this
plays out, Europe should look to the UK for its experience and
expertise, and perhaps also to its ability to act as a bridge to the US.
Both the UK and EU member states could host commercial sensors. In the
UK, radars or passive radio frequency reception sites like Goonhilly
Earth Station,35 a facility in Cornwall that provides commercial
tracking in LEO and MEO, are most likely, as the weather is not ideal
for optical facilities. It is currently unclear how the transition of
space tracking from the US Air Force to DoC in the US will affect the
data flows from sensors such as RAFFylingdales. Currently, data from
that radar cannot be shared worldwide due to the provisions of the
UK--US treaty (the station is operated under the UKUSA Agreement), which
also prevents it being optimized for space tracking. For example, it
would be possible to implement a new focused tracking mode at
Fylingdales to detect and track smaller objects than it currently sees
(albeit with the need for cueing data from the Space Fence) but this is
not allowed under the treaty.

[There is a **need for mutual exchange** of STM data **between the EU
and the US**, but there is a **problem** regarding the
**classification** and **accessibility of data** (this is largely a
problem on the US side).]{.underline} A [**multilateral data-sharing
agreement** between the US and one or more EU member state would greatly
help,]{.underline} but the [US is often reluctant to implement
multilateral agreements]{.underline}. This may change with moves to
commercialize STM in the US, but with militaries globally increasing
their orbital activities, there is likely to remain a significant
portion of data that is not considered releasable. [Nevertheless, the EU
could **contribute independent sources of information** on all trackable
resident space objects and events. As noted above, one of the major
problems with SSA is that rarely, if ever, does a single hypothesis
explain the evidence. This implies **ambiguity** on inferred quantities
and events and thus clouds or hinders informed and meaningful
decision-making. **Global SSA data harmonization** is therefore
**critical** for curating the required high quantity and diversity of
data and information. The EU could help or even **lead in this
effort.**]{.underline}

[The broader definition of SSA allows for additional scenarios for
collaboration.]{.underline} [The first of these is around the issue of
**space weather**]{.underline}. [The EU can support and **promote** the
provision of **operational weather services** as foreseen in the
proposed EU space programme.]{.underline} A major space weather event
could potentially cause more damage to satellites and ground stations
than the other threats and hazards and would render other aspects of SSA
obsolete. [At]{.underline} **present**[, both NASA and ESA, as well as
other international actors, have mechanisms for monitoring solar
activity, although current prediction capabilities are limited and there
is a need for more missions that increase the ability to understand
solar activity and provide longer prediction times]{.underline}. It is
also important in this regard to ensure exchange of scientific research
outputs and data related to warnings so that all satellite operators,
regardless of location, receive the necessary information. [A major
space weather event could potentially cause more damage to satellites
and ground stations than the other threats and hazards and would render
other aspects of SSA obsolete.]{.underline}

[The second area is **intelligence**. As European states increase their
**military assets in space** there is a **need for intelligence
gathering** regarding the intentions and capabilities of potential
adversaries such as **Russia and China**.]{.underline} While cooperation
in this regard will have the same difficulties as that of military STM
activities, [if Europe increases its space intelligence capabilities it
may prove useful to the Five Eyes states to reach an information-sharing
agreement]{.underline}. An [**increase in European SSA capabilities**
provides states with additional intelligence and the ability to **better
track and classify objects** that are considered to be a potential
danger. As the US and Europe continue close military cooperation,
particularly through NATO, possible future **EU monitoring of
adversarial space activities** is likely to be a **welcome
contribution** to SSA by its allies]{.underline}

[A further area of SSA is the security of ground stations that operate
satellites as well as the security of manufacturers and the supply
chains on which they depend]{.underline}. Even if there is an optimum
situation in tracking space objects and a complete, shareable catalogue,
if ground stations are at risk from intentional attack or natural
hazards the dangers to satellites are still present. Similarly,
satellite supply chains are often very complex, and problems with just
one component could affect the operations of satellites, creating an
additional level of uncertainty. [The EU can look to lead the way or
**partner** **with others** such as the US to **ensure adequate levels
of security for ground stations** of satellite operators and strong
regulation of the space industrial sector]{.underline}. This could be
done by prom[oting the best practices of large, multinational
corporations that work in both the US and Europe and, often through
military contracts, have experience in incorporating such
measures.]{.underline} Putting this issue front and centre will help to
ensure that ground stations, particularly those run by commercial
operators, are aware of the potential risks as well as the mitigation
measures that they can put in place.

Overall, [there are a number of potential scenarios for
collaboration.]{.underline} However, it should be understood that not
all within the SSA community see the future of these activities as being
state-led. The preferred option of many is that industry, academia and
other interested parties lead the work. This is in part because of the
timescales involved in government negotiation and decision-making. [One
suggestion is therefore to build a solution from the bottom-up, forming
a consortium to harness and produce transdisciplinary SSA that takes
advantage of a broad range of knowledge and expertise]{.underline}. This
could be done through the formation of a growing coalition of the
willing to demonstrate incremental capability and added value. [The **EU
could play a key role** in **fostering an environment** that would allow
such development and advocate a truly **international effort** that
includes the US.]{.underline}

Conclusion

Taking into consideration the anticipated developments in space over the
short- to medium-term, [it is clear that there are opportunities for
increased cooperation between the EU and the US in SSA and that such
collaboration is needed.]{.underline} The EU has publicly noted its
intention to act as a leader in promoting the responsible use of space,
for example through its proposal of an International Code of Conduct for
Outer Space Activities.36 [Cooperation mechanisms between the US and the
EU would not only improve the individual SSA capabilities of each and
the **global effort** but also act as a **blueprint for cooperation**
with other partners, such as the Five Eyes community, Japan and
India.]{.underline}

Cooperation is also essential when considering the possibility that SSA
capabilities, rather than space assets, could become a target of
adversarial action with the aim of decreasing a state or operator's
ability to track objects or otherwise affect their knowledge in such a
way as to put their assets in danger. For example, it is possible that
that an adversary of the US would target its SSAcapabilities to gain an
advantage by 'blinding' the US to what is happening in orbit.
International cooperation in SSA among global partners, which could
provide orbital information if it is lost by one partner, would add a
layer of resilience to SSA capabilities.

There are obvious challenges to EU--US SSA integration. The first is the
issue of secrecy. In this area Europe and the US may not be as far apart
as might be initially thought as most state space actors have some
military aspect within their capabilities. The key will be to find ways
to encourage cooperation in the commercial and civil spheres while
allowing individual states to operate and monitor their classified
assets as they see fit -- sharing what information they are willing to
and able to depend upon the military or civilian nature of future EU
member state tracking capabilities. As already described, changes within
the US government's SSA policy may provide the best mechanism for such
activity to move forward. Secondly, the US always wants to be the leader
in everything in the space domain rather than be an equal partner. This
is becoming even more obvious through the rhetoric of many US military
and government leaders, with talk of the need to dominate and lead in
space as a reaction to the activities and perceived threats of Russia
and China. Therefore[, the **EU needs to prove its value** **as a
partner in space** and advocate for international cooperation as the
best way for both parties to achieve state goals and maintain the
stability of orbit. Finally, it is important for there to be a
**cohesive understanding** of how **EU SSA programmes** will cooperate
both with member states and with ESA.]{.underline}

[The **EU needs to increase its capabilities**, either through
activities that **plug existing gaps** or through using its geographical
situation to augment the activities of other states. This approach will
provide it with a **platform** to become a leading player in this regard
and prove it can **add value to the global SSA effort**]{.underline}.
[The US will then see it as an indispensable partner in ensuring the
sustainability of the near-Earth environment over the coming
decades.]{.underline}

[The Space Surveillance and Tracking segment of the **European SSA** is
arguably **contributing to preventive action** on the issue of **space
debris**.]{.underline} [In terms of **outer space security**, while
preventive security measures may be oriented towards threats with an
'objectively given existence' \[40\], the element of surprise is still
important]{.underline}. Whereas the measures included within the Code
are directed at reducing future debris generation, the monitoring of
existing debris clouds and the contributions to a European debris
catalogue by the Space Surveillance and [Tracking segment serve to
provide detailed orbital trajectory information to satellite operators
with the objective of forewarning operators of impending collisions,
enabling them to make avoidance manoeuvres should they feel the need to
do so.]{.underline} It could be argued that, in terms of anticipatory
security, the Space Surveillance and Tracking segment is seeking to
enhance the statistical calculability of the danger posed by the
existing space debris population. The focus then is on securing the
present through the mitigation of surprise, although there may be
further applications in the future should feasible space debris
remediation technologies be developed and deployed. The second [SSA area
involves the forecasting and monitoring of space weather
events]{.underline}. These include solar flares, Coronal Mass Ejections
and Solar Energetic Particle bursts that can cause significant damage to
terrestrial and extra-terrestrial infrastructures. The largest recorded
space weather event, known as the Carrington Event, took place in
September 1859 and began with a 'solar flare so strong that it could be
seen with the naked eye' \[69\]. The solar flare was followed by a huge
Coronal Mass Ejection which disrupted telegraph systems on Earth, to the
extent that '\[o\]perators were able to disconnect their batteries and
continue to send messages using only this induced current' \[70\]. More
recently, in 1989, a notably severe CME caused a failure of the power
grid in Quebec, leaving around six million people without electricity
for 9 h, whilst transformers in the UK and the US were also damaged
\[71,72\]. [The **space weather segment** of the European SSA contains
both preventive and preemptive elements]{.underline}. On the one hand[,
it involves the forecasting of imminent extra-terrestrial phenomena
produced by solar activity in order to warn satellite operators of
fluctuations in the solar and near-Earth environments, making it a
reactive security mechanism enabling calculable probabilities based upon
pre-existing solar activity.]{.underline} However, [there is a
preemptive aspect to its operations insofar as the solar activity which
produces space weather events cannot be predicted.]{.underline}
Moreover, the segment includes research undertaken into significant
space weather events for which there is little historical data. A number
of studies have considered the effects that a severe event on a similar
scale to, or larger than, the Carrington Event might have on terrestrial
and extra-terrestrial infrastructures \[73\]. In addition, and although
not strictly part of the SSA Space Weather segment, sensors have also
been placed on board the Galileo satellites to monitor radiation levels
in Middle Earth Orbit. As well as contributing to the development of
more robust satellites, this research is also serving to condition those
working with vulnerable infrastructures to the possibility and danger of
a severe space weather event, improving their resilience if faced with
an event of similar magnitude to the Carrington Event. These studies and
practices are contributing to the development and refinement of
imaginaries concerned with the impact of future significant space
weather events. [**Nothing can be done to prevent or stop space weather
phenomena**, but increased levels of awareness amongst those who deal
with the consequences may lead to more effective damage limitation and
recovery]{.underline}. [In terms of critical infrastructure security,
space weather acts as a pertinent example of the need for resilience as
well as protection. If a space weather event were to disable active
space objects e overcoming the component hardening and shielding that
some satellites carry e the capability to resume operations rapidly
through redundancies becomes vitally important.]{.underline} The third
area of the [European SSA is focused upon the detection of **Near-Earth
Objects**.]{.underline} [These are natural hazards such as asteroids
with the potential to cause significant terrestrial damage. The risk of
these objects hitting the Earth is arguably one of the more widely-known
extra-terrestrial environmental factors, with visible geological
evidence of historical events and numerous films using the scenario as a
foundation.]{.underline} Although [there is very little risk of
asteroids or meteoroids causing damage to satellites, the segment of the
European SSA dedicated to the detection of these astronomical phenomena
is nonetheless **reflective** of an **anticipatory security logic** and
thus worthy of inclusion within this discussion.]{.underline} Of all the
segments of the SSA, the area devoted to near-Earth objects is the most
preemptive in nature. The risk of an asteroid colliding with the Earth
is relatively small, yet there is substantial financial and political
backing for the detection of these astronomical phenomena. To this end,
the near-Earth object segment of the European SSA is charged with
searching for objects with a trajectory which may lead to them impacting
the Earth, as well as contributing to the research and development of
methods to deflect them \[74\]. The development of deflection
technologies is particularly preemptive, as it deals with a threat that
will remain unclear until a near-Earth object is identified as being on
a collision course with the Earth. [The European SSA is a **preventive**
and **preemptive** anticipatory **security mechanism**; the Space
Surveillance and Tracking and space weather segments are predominantly
oriented towards forewarning of imminent threats posed by space debris
and space weather through the use of statistical probability
calculations.]{.underline} In this manner, [they **work to mitigate**
the element of surprise caused by unanticipated **collisions** or
**radiation** by informing satellite operators of significant risks,
allowing them to make avoidance manoeuvres if necessary]{.underline}.
Regarding [preemptive measures]{.underline}, although research is being
undertaken into the possibility and consequences of cascading debris
generation or large-scale space weather events, it does not appear to be
a central component of the European SSA. This said, space surveillance
is intrinsically a passive security mechanism focused upon imminent
dangers and, until the technologies and governance structures are in
place for space debris remediation, the Space Surveillance and Tracking
segment will have limited application in terms of preemptive actions. It
is feasible that SSA programmes will be able to identify particularly
hazardous debris if and when space debris remediation becomes viable but
until then, it will remain a security mechanism dedicated to providing
collision warnings and monitoring debris populations

4.4.4. [Strengthening EU resilience on security and defence]{.underline}

[**Resilience** in foreign and security policy is a central element of
the EU Global Strategy, which has identified a number of
non-conventional threats, including **terrorism**, **hybrid and
cyber**.]{.underline} Most Member States\' strategic documents mention
these threats, which are likely also to be reflected in the upcoming EU
Strategic Compass. 136 [The majority of Heads of State or Government who
took part in the Future of Europe debates in the European Parliament
plenary recognised **terrorism, cyber-attacks and disinformation as
common threats** to both the EU and the Member States and have called
for a **joint response**, mindful of their dual internal and external
dimension]{.underline}. In a joint letter addressed to their colleagues,
the Ministers of Defence of France, Germany, Spain and Italy stressed
that the [pandemic had shown the \'relevance of a close
coordination\']{.underline} and that [EU Member States \'have to
**improve significantly their ability to counter hybrid-**,
disinformation or cyberattacks\', to **enhance** communication networks
as well as **\'cyber-interoperability, security and
resilience\'**.]{.underline}

[To enhance resilience in facing hybrid threats, in the June 2020
Council Conclusions on Security and Defence, the EU committed to work
towards an EU \'security culture\' and to protect critical
infrastructure. It has also committed to preserve its decision-making
from \'malicious activities\', thus enabling the Union to ensure it acts
autonomously and remains fully operational at any time.]{.underline}
[The coronavirus outbreak challenged the EU and its Member States with a
crisis of an unprecedented scale, which called upon their **unity**,
**tested their resilience** and led them to **consider building
strategic autonomy** as a way to overcome growing vulnerabilities and
counter exposure to hybrid threats, including
disinformation.]{.underline} President von der Leyen notably pointed to
the spike in online disinformation activities and hospital-related
cyber-attacks originating from China and linked to the coronavirus
outbreak. Consequently, the European Commission published a joint
communication on disinformation, in which it clearly indicated China,
alongside Russia, to be among those actors promoting misleading
narratives, related, for example, to the EU\'s support for third
countries. 137 Early in the crisis, the European Council recognised that
fighting disinformation with fact-based communication is a key element
that allows it to \'reinforce the resilience\' of European societies.
Already prior to the pandemic, the European Council had regularly
considered disinformation, 138 at that time mainly originating from
Russia, and stressed that there was a need for a coordinated EU response
in implementing the joint action plan on disinformation, which inter
alia calls for a clear mandate and sufficient resources for the
strategic communication teams within the EEAS. This requires rapid
action and resources if the EEAS is to expand its strategic
communication activity -- so far mainly focused on Russia, the Western
Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa and the Gulf States -- to
cover, in a more comprehensive manner, China.

[**Bolstering** **resilience** **to hybrid, cyber and terrorist
activities is a key element of EU-NATO cooperation**. Academics stress
that \'collective defence\' is and will remain the core task of NATO,
but that the **EU could and should play an enhanced role in the hybrid,
cyber or counter-terrorism response**.]{.underline} 139 The [NATO summit
in London displayed the diverging views of the different leaders on the
future of the alliance]{.underline}; some of them, including French
President Macron, being of the opinion that a stronger European pillar
within NATO would strengthen both the EU and NATO and help share the
transatlantic security burden. Analysts concur to say that
staff-to-staff cooperation on technical aspects, including on hybrid and
cyber aspects, is running smoothly and that the implementation of the
2016 Warsaw EU-NATO Joint Declaration and of the 2018 Brussels EU-NATO
Joint Declaration led inter alia to progress on crisis preparedness,
joint training and information exchange. [Nevertheless, in the
long-term, unless the current political blockage is overcome, it might
have a negative impact on the implementation of the two joint
declarations. Resilience, defined as the ability to renew, resist and be
\'crisis-proof\' when faced with both internal and external threats, not
only relates to non-conventional, but also to conventional threats.140
One of the **leading initiatives** in building **EU resilience** in
response to conventional threats is military mobility.]{.underline}

4.3 Protecting critical infrastructure and supply chains

A third area that deserves attention at the EU level is the protection
of critical supplies and supply chains. [Indeed, **strategic autonomy in
space** relies on the safety and proper functioning of **space** and
terrestrial **infrastructure**]{.underline} (e.g. satellites and ground
stations). [Equally important is the need to ensure that there is no
disruption to supplies of technologies, components and
materials.]{.underline} [The **EU is steadily recognising** that
**supplies** and **infrastructure** are vital components of the Union's
**resilience and autonomy**]{.underline}. Overseeing [programmes such as
Galileo]{.underline} has had the effect of [alerting the EU to the need
for critical infrastructure and supply safeguards]{.underline}. In this
respect, there is a [need to recognise that flagship
programmes]{.underline} such as Galileo or any future satellite
constellation [may **integrate non-EU technologies** and this may in
some cases pose a potential dependency. Control of technology and IPRs
are an essential feature of strategic autonomy (autonomy to and autonomy
from).]{.underline}

5 Conclusion and recommendations

[**Space** is one of the domains where the EU has achieved a **degree of
strategic autonomy**]{.underline}. This is because the [EU had a clear
vision for space, it has invested financial resources and it has
launched ambitious projects. Overall, the EU has been able to specify
why it wants autonomy in the first place (autonomy for), what resources
it requires to **achieve** it (**autonomy** to) and how it intends to
use this autonomy to **lower dependencies** on external factors and
actors (autonomy from)]{.underline}. In this sense, the first of three
questions posed at the start of this study can be answered by saying
that the [EU recognises that]{.underline} **[space is vital for its
economy and security]{.underline}**. [The second question, which asked
if **space had contributed to the EU's strategic autonomy**, can be
**answered with a qualified yes**.]{.underline} Indeed, [the third
question on what more is needed to enhance the EU's autonomy in space is
a key one that poses many challenges and difficult choices. The EU's
positive actions in space should not breed complacency]{.underline}.
[Strategic autonomy is not something that can only be achieved, for it
can also be lost over time too. A priority for the EU, therefore, is to
tend to its existing degree of **strategic autonomy in space** with
further investments that **harness emerging technologies** and support
the European space market. None of this is really possible, however,
without a strong degree of political will from EU
governments.]{.underline}

This study has shown how any discussion about [EU strategic autonomy in
space has to contend with two trends. First, space is a **geopolitical
realm** and, while most space-faring nations claim to be invested in the
**peaceful use of space**, the reality is that countries such as the
**US, China and Russia** are moving at some speed to develop space
capacities for their military power. This current geopolitical context
demands that the EU **reframes** how it sees its **role in
space**]{.underline}. If indeed outer space is an additional domain for
geopolitical tensions to be played out (and if it is a domain that
contributes to geopolitical competition back on earth), questions about
the [EU's **readiness and willingness to engage** in the space domain
from a defence perspective are legitimate]{.underline}. For the EU, this
implies that while it wants to adhere to international legal obligations
it will exist alongside countries that may actively blur the line
between space and defence for geopolitical reasons.

Second, [space is a technological frontier and the space sector is
presently subject to rapid technological shifts, but it could also be
one where the line between space systems designed for peaceful and
military purposes is increasingly blurred]{.underline}. In the present
period of economic crisis due to the pandemic, the risk of
underinvestment in the civil and defence sectors may spill-over into the
space sector -- and the [European space sector itself is in need of
sustained levels of investment]{.underline}. [This is a crucial time for
the **technological advancement** of the European space sector and there
should be a **strong recognition that EU strategic autonomy in space**
can only be **achieved** with the technical know-how and innovation of
Europe's space industry.]{.underline}

3 The EU as an autonomous space actor

Now that a definition of strategic autonomy in space has been provided,
and before looking at areas where the EU is still lagging behind, this
chapter focuses on the ways in which it has attained a level of
strategic autonomy in space. In this respect, we will see [how the EU
fares when it comes to the three forms of strategic
autonomy]{.underline} outlined in the previous chapter. It should be
said that the [European **space** sector is an **essential feature** of
the EU economy and its **strategic autonomy**]{.underline}. [Europe can
already boast to being a leader in space exploration with the Rosetta
and BepiColombo programmes showing that the continent has the
technological means for critical space missions. It is also true that
Europe is developing next generation launch capabilities]{.underline}
such as Ariane 6 and Vega C77, which should reduce the cost of space
launches while offering more attractive payload set-ups and shorter lead
times for production. It should also be noted that a number of European
launcher and satellite companies are genuinely transnational and bring
together leading space companies from across Europe.

3.1 "European" or"EU" strategic autonomy?

It is important to make a distinction between "Europe's" space efforts
and the "EU's" specific capabilities and programmes in the context of
any debate about strategic autonomy. From a technical point of view the
EU's core space capabilities Galileo, EGNOS and Copernicus are European
programmes because they rely on EU and member state funding and the
technical expertise of non-EU bodies such as the ESA and the European
Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites
(EUMETSAT). [This poses a point of reflection of what is actually meant
by "strategic autonomy" and "Europe" when discussing space.]{.underline}
[For example, while it is true that the EU is one of the major public
institutions financing the space sector, it relies on the technical
expertise of bodies such as national space agencies]{.underline}, the
ESA and EUMETSAT to technically develop launch and satellite
technologies and these bodies in turn work with industrial and research
partners across Europe. [Space cooperation in Europe therefore
represents a mix of supranational and intergovernmental actors and
structures.]{.underline}

78 [Together, Galileo, EGNOS and Copernicus offer the EU a **high level
of strategic autonomy** as it allows it to observe earth, protect
transport networks, sustain digital networks and the security of trade
routes and much more]{.underline}. While Galileo, EGNOS and Copernicus
do not yet fully cover all of the tasks illustrated in Figure 4, the
future applications provided by these programmes is potentially far
reaching.

4 Advancing **[EU autonomy in space]{.underline}**

In the last chapter we focused on areas in which the EU had advanced its
strategic autonomy in space, but it also started to detail some of the
challenges facing the EU's ability to maintain and extend its autonomy
in space in the future. In this chapter we analyse further some of the
key areas that the [EU needs to focus on in the future. As we have seen,
**space is too important to neglec**t from a security and defence
perspective and it is a sector experiencing **momentous technological
shifts.**]{.underline} We have so far stressed the importance of
continued investment in the European space sector, but it is equally
necessary to spell out the key areas where the EU needs to focus in the
coming years. [In particular, industrial competition will be intense but
a **comprehensive EU approach** to **space is required** that grapples
with issues such as **connectivity, technological developments**,
**critical infrastructure** protection and **security and
defence.**]{.underline}

4.1 **[Promoting space and connectivity]{.underline}**

[One of the aspects of space that is becoming increasingly obvious is
its role in promoting the EU's "**digital sovereignty**".]{.underline}
[Today, the EU is concerned with the digitalisation of its economy and
this implies the integration of a range of economic sectors and
technologies.93]{.underline} Yet there is a need to understand [how
space can **facilitate** a wider **EU connectivity
strategy**]{.underline}. As one example shows, the drive to ensure
complete satellite broadband coverage across the EU, lay the foundations
for 6G and accrue the benefits of the Internet of Things (IoT) demands
close collaboration between the space and telecommunications sectors.
European Commissioner Thierry Breton has already floated the idea of
developing a global constellation of satellites that could help the EU
move from data collection from space to data processing.94 [A flagship
EU programme focused on developing a "**connectivity constellation**"
would lower its dependence on third states and allow it to collect and
process data without fear of external interference. In this sense, any
flagship project of this nature would require a strong underlying
security logic that protects signals, data transfers and communications
links.]{.underline}

The same underlying logic that saw Galileo take off could advance the
EU's broadband satellite ambitions. At present, public and private
companies in China and the US are moving at some speed to develop LEO
and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) internet global coverage constellation
programmes. [The **EU cannot fall behind** in this domain as any market
lead by China and the US will **potentially damage the EU's autonomy in
space and in the digital domain**, with growing dependencies on
constellation systems not owned by EU private actors or public
authorities]{.underline}. It would be a **[strategic
error]{.underline}** to not seize on the potential of satellite
broadband, and it would to some degree echo (and even address) similar
security concerns related to non-EU 5G networks and providers that are
linked too closely to third states authorities and potential political
disruption. [Even here there would be a security and defence dimension,
as EU armed forces would benefit from having secure blanket broadband
coverage for operations and missions. **Reliance** on a third state
system would only **increase the risk of** internet **blackouts**, which
would be potentially **hazardous for EU armed forces.**]{.underline}

4.1.1 Learning from Galileo

[Accordingly, greater **EU connectivity and digitalisation** **rests**
**on** political ambition and investment, but initiatives below the
public radar can have an important effect on **connecting space with the
EU economy.**]{.underline} Firstly, [it is important to scope out how
each EU policy area would benefit from greater **space-enabled
connectivity**.]{.underline} Learning from the early experiences of
Galileo, more should have been done to mandate EU institutions and
services to use the global positioning and navigation system in their
areas of work. In this regard, an important lesson has been learned
during the pandemic as the EU's response to Covid-19 has relied on
Galileo to ensure the proper functioning of the "Green Lane" initiative
which ensures the free passage of freight transportation across borders
(e.g. there is a Galileo Green Lane app). Copernicus has also been used
by EU institutions to monitor air pollution during the pandemic.
[Consequently, no ambitious EU connectivity initiative can succeed
without comprehensive public outreach that explains to citizens the
**benefits of space**. Connectivity will increasingly be an important
feature of the EU's diplomacy in regions such as Asia.]{.underline}

[Connectivity will rely on greater symbiosis between policy sectors. One
set of sectors that can be synergised to ensure **greater connectivity**
are the civil, space and defence domains. Not only would a connection
between these policy areas stimulate the integration of **dual-use
technologies** into **space development** programmes, but it could lead
to **greater technology transfers** between space and
defence]{.underline}. Of course, such a step will not be challenge free
and in fact it is difficult to create technology commonalities between
space and defence at the higher readinesslevels of technology (TRLs).
What is required instead is a focus on lower TRLs to ensure cost
reductions and greater technology diffusion, and to avoid a misalignment
of civil, space and defence Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs).96 [This
is specifically **critical for the space sector,** which has 'very low
production volumes' but high capital intensity and start-up technology
costs.97 In essence, therefore, connectivity is about connecting policy
domains, space and terrestrial technologies and R&D
processes.]{.underline}

4.4 **[EU space, security and defence]{.underline}**

[The fourth area of the **EU's strategic autonomy** that **requires
greater attention** is the **link between space and defence**, although
in this area much will depend on the political willingness of EU member
state governments]{.underline}.116 By link, we do not mean here just
industrial or R&D links but [operational and capability]{.underline}
ones too.

4.4.1 **[Enabling the ability to act]{.underline}**

[If the EU is to ensure that it has the capacity to act on earth as a
credible security and defence actor, then it needs to ensure that EU
space initiatives meet the needs of European armed forces]{.underline}.
Space is not a place where actors win wars, but they may well lose them
on earth should space not be harnessed effectively as a strategic
enabler. [Today, the defence of space systems and earth-based
capabilities that are dependent on space are particularly vulnerable to
electronic warfare that can effect signals communications and orbital
calculations and data sensing.]{.underline} We know that t[here is a
need for the EU to stay abreast of technological developments such as
the potential future use of sophisticated electronic warfare
capabilities and other disruptive technologies in space.]{.underline} It
is also true that Europe's armed forces are increasingly dependent on
earth observation (earth imagery, weather, intelligence and missile
warning), telecommunications (secure narrow and broad bands and data
secure communications) and PNT capacities in order to perform their
duties.

While most of the answers to these questions will be provided by
industry and technology, [this should not discount the importance of
**strategic space-defence planning**]{.underline}. Indeed, space is
mentioned by the EUGS and the Implementation Plan on Security and
Defence (ISPD), and such [documents have aided the initiation of several
EU space-defence capability and technology projects]{.underline}. [What
is **missing**, however, is a **more focused understanding** of how the
EU could treat space from a military perspective]{.underline}. This may
sound like a taboo subject, but [the EU is, after all, funding
space-defence technologies]{.underline}. PNT and SST are vital
components of the EU's ability to react militarily but yet the EU has
not developed an overarching concept for the way it understands the
links between space and security and defence. [In this regard, the
forthcoming "Strategic Compass" could be an ideal opportunity to
integrate space into CSDP and EU security and defence more broadly.
There is not one basket under the Strategic Compass -- crisis
management, resilience, capability development and partnerships - that
is not relevant to or affected by space.]{.underline}

[The **need for a strategic vision for space and defence** is not simply
theoretical]{.underline}. For example, it is worth asking how space
should be thought of in light of some important EU Treaty provisions
such as the mutual assistance117 and solidarity118 clauses. At first
glance, one might argue that Article 42.7 does not really apply to space
because the clause refers to an 'armed aggression' on the 'territory' of
a member state. Stricto sensu it may be argued that the word 'territory'
effectively rules out space as the Treaty specifically references
attacks on land or within maritime boundaries and airspace. [However,
acts of armed aggression on the territory of an EU member state can be
supported from space and any destruction of EU space infrastructure
could disable terrestrial defences]{.underline}. As far as Article 222
is concerned, space should not be neglected as part of any joint action
to assist a member state in case of a terrorist attack or natural or
manmade disasters.119Of course, because NATO has declared space an
operational domain it is necessary for the alliance to assess how
space-based threats could be covered by Article 5 of the Washington
Treaty and collective defence.120

[Additionally, we should not overlook the **important role** that
**space** can play in the **EU's diplomacy**, partnerships and support
for **multilateralism**. In particular, the Space Task Force should be
recognised as a core hub through which the **EU can promote space
partnerships and space diplomacy**]{.underline}. It plays a key role
vis-à-vis the HR/VP who in turn brings together the EEAS, EDA and
SatCen. With the correct level of resources, the Space Task Force would
be in a better position to promote the responsible use of space
internationally and it could build on its positive contributions to the
2030 Space Agenda and the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer
Space (COPUOS). What is more, the Space Task Force plays a vital role
alongside SatCen in promoting the Union's geospatial awareness and
intelligence with partners. To date, SatCen's services have been
promoted by the Task Force with partners such as the African Union (AU),
the OSCE and the International agency for Atomic Energy (IAEA). [There
is scope for the Task Force to advance space issues within the context
of the EU's Strategic Partnership Agreements (SPAs) and **EU-NATO
cooperation**, however, it requires greater resources in order to
**conduct** more **ambitious EU space diplomacy.**]{.underline}

[Yet, EU Space Diplomacy is only as strong as **unity** **between EU
member states**. In this respect, there are notable **divisions**
between member states on how to utilise and view space. Such divisions
leave the Union exposed to "divide and rule" strategies by third
states]{.underline}. The October 2020 Artemis Accords highlight the
problem well. The Accords are a US initiative to forge a common position
on the use of space and they take a controversial approach by
prefiguring potential activities on the Moon, Mars, comets and asteroids
that have no firm consensus in multilateral fora or international legal
interpretations. The current US administration has opted for bilateral
space agreements as a way for the US to export norms and policies that
are designed to push America's competitive advantage and vision for
space.121 To date, the US and two EU member states have bilaterally
signed the Accords (rather than the EU as a whole). While the Artemis
Accords are not legally binding, they have exposed EU member states'
divisions on space use and this makes it incredibly difficult for the
Union to forge a common space diplomacy or ensure its strategic
autonomy.

4.4.2 Space defence capabilities

To say that the EU is not working to develop space-defence technology
needs is false. For example, space has already been integrated into the
EDA's Capability Development Plan (CDP) and in 2018 it designated the
following areas as capability priorities from a defence perspective:
earth observation, PNT, SSA, satellite communication, information
superiority and management, ISR and cyber defence. To fill these
capability gaps, the Agency has initiated R&T programmes that model and
simulate micro-satellite clusters (i.e. the Miracle II project), develop
geospatial information support (e.g. the GISMO project) and it has even
been mandated to study the requirements and business case for military
PNT by 2020.122 Such efforts are being taken up through other mechanisms
such as PESCO and the EDF, and there is an opportunity for the EU to
enhance greater awareness of space-defence matters and to better plan
for the development ofspace-defence capabilities. It should also be
noted that the EDA's Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD) offers
a good opportunity to focus member state investments in space and
defence. Furthermore, the Agency's work on Key Strategic Activities
(KSAs) and the space-related Technology Building Blocks(TBBs) under the
Overarching Strategic Research Agenda (OSRA) have already stressed the
importance of technologies for space situational awareness and
communications encryption.

To date, in PESCO there are three specific space-related projects
focusing on radio navigation ("EURAS"), military space awareness
("EU-SSA-N") and space early warning and interception ("TWISTER"). The
EURAS project seeks to benefit from Galileo's PRS by promoting the
development of EU military PNT capabilities. For its part, EU-SSA-N adds
to the civilian nature of the EUSST by ensuring that the Union has the
means to protect member state space defence assets and services. The
preparatory mechanisms under the EDF are supporting space-defence
capability development. The PADR is supporting R&D projects for quantum
secure communication and navigation and a defence positioning system in
GNSS denied areas (see the "Quantaquest" and "Optimise" projects). The
EDIDP is financing 3 specific projects including: 1) a persistent earth
observation from space capability that fuses automated data processing,
AI and real time processors and sensors (i.e. the "PEONEER" project); 2)
a cost-effective and very high resolution optical capability for small
satellites (i.e. the "OPTISSE" project); and 3) a project to benefit
from Galileo's PRS for defence-specific requirements (i.e. the "GEODE"
project). This last project is linked to the EURAS project within PESCO.

What is noticeable is that each of these PESCO and EDF (PADR/EDIDP)
projects work with and adapt to existing EU space initiatives such as
Galileo and EUSST. In this sense, PESCO and the EDF have been effective
in allowing member states to develop defence-relevant capabilities
together despite the civil nature of existing space projects. This
presents an opportunity to avoid duplication and costs. This type of
logic undergirds the EU member states' approach to Government Satellite
Communications (GovSatCom) too, as access to secure communications is a
prerequisite for armed forces that operate in hostile environments.
Developing EU GovSatCom is important because the US, China and Russia
are developing, refining or modernising military intelligence and
communications systems. First announced in 2013 and then referred to in
the EUGS in 2016, there is a consensus that developing a GovSatCom
capability would contribute to the EU's strategic autonomy in space,
security and defence. So far, the EDA has brought GovSatCom forward by
identifying civil-military user needs, demonstrating the business case
for the system for governments and CSDP users and conducting an impact
assessment along with the Commission and ESA. Since this time, GovSatCom
has been included in the EUSP and it is foreseen that an initial
capacity will draw on private and member state capacities until 2025 in
order to gauge government demand. The fact that such a project will be
financed by the EU is a significant step in enhancing the secure
communications of European armed forces.

4.4.3 Geospatial intelligence

A[nother key aspect of the EU's space-defence capability set relates to
geospatial intelligence.]{.underline} It is true that a number of EU
member states have their own military grade earth observation systems
(e.g. CosmoSkyMed, Hélios, SAR-Lupe, etc.), but there is no guarantee
that national geospatial intelligence will be shared. [This is why
SatCen remains relevant, as it provides such intelligence for the EU as
a whole. Indeed, the Centre provides a range of EU, national and
international consumers with high quality intelligence of satellite
imagery]{.underline}. It plays a key role in CFSP and CSDP and it
informs decision-makers with tailored intelligence products. While it is
true that a range of commercial firms can provide satellite imagery,
SatCen is unique in being able to provide institutional and political
authorities with sensitive and classified analysis. [Without SatCen,
there would be no other central EU body to provide sensitive analysis in
support of crisis management tasks, border management, the delivery of
EU humanitarian aid, disaster monitoring, etc. We should not forget that
SatCen plays a vital role within EUSST, which contributes to the
security of **European space assets** in orbit.]{.underline}

Clearly[, many see the Centre as a **key enabler of strategic autonomy**
as demand from the EU member states]{.underline} and the EEAS has
increased steadily since 2014 and in 2019 the Centre delivered a total
of 3,080 products compared to 478 in 2009.123Yet, the SatCen must be
supported in its role. A major priority is to ensure that the Centre is
placed on a sound financial footing, but in a way that it can grow to
accommodate greater demand and to seize the opportunities of the "new
space" evolution and technological advances. At present, the SatCen
budget is provided by national contributions but it might be necessary
to consider new financial arrangements to ensure that the Centre has the
resources it requires. While SatCen will remain an intergovernmental
body, it is worth exploring whether resources from the EU budget could
not be made available in future. However, such a move should be
accompanied with an expansion of the Centre's role as the EU experiences
a wider array of security challenges in space and on earth. [Keep in
mind that several internal security tasks could benefit from SatCen's
expertise, and it should not be overlooked that the Centre could play a
vital role in case either the EU's mutual assistance or solidarity
clauses are invoked.]{.underline}

4.4. [Security and defence]{.underline}

[The current risk landscape is multidimensional and characterised by
both conventional and novel threats:]{.underline} 107 [from
transnational **crime networks** and **terrorism** to the **corrosion of
arms control regimes,** **cyber-attacks** and **hybrid warfare**, the
scale and complexity of threats to **peace and stability** is such that
none of the EU Member States \'has the strength nor the resources to
address these threats\' alone.]{.underline} In this context, [the
**European Union\'s ability** to independently and **autonomously**
**make effective decisions** regarding the security of its Member States
and its citizens, **grows in importance**]{.underline}.
[Building]{.underline} **[strategic autonomy]{.underline}** [on a mix of
\'soft\' -- sanctions, development cooperation, trade -- and \'hard\'
power tools, which still need to be politically agreed, could allow the
EU and its Member States to **respond to the threats and risks** with
which they are commonly confronted.]{.underline}

4.4.1. **[Contributing to global peace and stability]{.underline}**

[In an already volatile international context, the impact of the
coronavirus outbreak is likely to lead to **increased instability** and
to the **multiplication of regional conflicts** close to Europe and
around the world]{.underline}. This will impact conflict areas
disproportionately, [increasing the vulnerability of afflicted
populations and prolonging **conflict** in areas like the **Middle
East**]{.underline}. It may also [act as a]{.underline} **[\'conflict
multiplier\']{.underline}**, as [contestation over resources
expands]{.underline} to include securing access to vital medical
supplies, among other factors. 108 [The pandemic is also likely to
strain social relations and statesociety relations, potentially leading
**authoritarian governments** to increasingly undemocratic measures in
reaction to social disorder.]{.underline} 109 **[Great power
competition,]{.underline}** [redistribution of global power and
uncertainty about the future **relevance of multilateralism** will
impact **security** and **instability** **across the world,** as
discussed in previous sections of this study, potentially **threatening
global peace**.]{.underline}

In this context, [the promotion of peace]{.underline} -- one of the main
goals of the EU\'s external action as enshrined in Articles 3.5 and 21
TEU -- [becomes even more challenging. It is in the EU\'s security
interest to **strengthen its capacity to act credibly as a global
power**]{.underline}. It can do so by developing capabilities,
allocating resources, cooperating with partners or setting standards.
Over recent years, [the EU has embarked in a range of important reforms
to **develop strategic autonomy**]{.underline}. It has been working to
strengthen its ability to address critical developments in its
neighbourhood and worldwide more coherently and to mobilise the required
financial, civil and military resources. With various bilateral action
plans, financial instruments, and over 37 operations and crisis
management missions on three continents, [the EU could be considered an
**experienced** **global contributor to peace and
stability**]{.underline}. However, as the European Parliament has
stressed in one of its resolutions, [the challenge for the EU is to take
a \'proactive rather than responsive approach to global
affairs\',]{.underline} including in areas pertaining to EU Common
Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).

4.4.1.1. [Strategic planning and responsiveness]{.underline}

The effectiveness of the CSDP has been a subject of debate since 2016.
Recognised weaknesses included: 1) the planning process for missions and
operations which remained \'cumbersome and slow\'; 2) the institutional
setting of the EEAS which exhibited redundancies; and 3) the lack of
centralised military planning and conduct structures which hampered the
capacity for crisis response.110 Since then, the political momentum to
address these problems has led to several institutional reforms, such as
the establishment of a permanent Military Planning and Conduct
Capability (MPCC) in the EEAS in 2017.111 In 2019, the EEAS further
integrated its \'conduct pillar\', that combines the responsibilities
for the civilian and military planning capabilities (CPCC and the new
MPCC), and its \'policy pillar\' (concerning PESCO, or cyber security)
into the Directorate for an Integrated Approach for Security and Peace,
coordinated through the Joint Support Coordination Cell (JSCC). These
reforms, among others, have the potential to further strengthen and
streamline planning and coordinate activities. 112 In 2018, to assist in
the efforts to promote peace and stability then HR/VP Mogherini and the
Council proposed the establishment of an off-budget European Peace
Facility, which could receive €5 billion for 2021-2027. The European
Parliament has called for proper parliamentary control over the Facility
and regular briefings on related decisions and on its implementation,
assuming the proposal is taken forward.

Beyond institutional, operational and financial innovations HR/VP
Borrell has argued that the EU still \'lacks a common strategic
culture\' as an international actor. It has been suggested that
strategic autonomy would provide this essential \'glue\' to the EU\'s
action for peace and security.113 One proposal, which among other things
would boost the EU\'s capacity to formulate coherent and rapid responses
to global and regional crises is the creation of a European Security
Council (ESC). An ESC would act as a governing body with authority over
common positions, operations and strategy in CFSP, contributing to
strategic readiness.114 The extension of qualified majority voting on
CFSP issues, including the deployment of CSDP civilian missions in
response to crises, would be part of the move towards strategic
autonomy, and could also contribute to readiness and effectiveness in
this area. The more recent launching of the Strategic Compass process,
to be taken forward by the German Presidency in the second half of 2020
-- aiming to also produce a shared threat assessment among EU Member
States -- holds significant value for the future of the EU\'s action in
countering threats and promoting peace. In a strategically autonomous
EU, effective decision-making regarding global peace must also be backed
by consequential and proportionate operational capabilities. In his
parliamentary hearing, HR/VP Borrell stressed \'we have to be more
operational on the ground. We have to deploy forces, starting with our
neighbourhood\'.

[The **EU\'s capacity to prevent crises**, address ongoing **conflicts
and disasters**, and **provide** **postconflict stability** depends not
only on an integrated approach towards **crisis management**, but also
on agreement on the EU\'s long-term strategic goals and access to
**autonomous and independent foresight capacity**, which would prepare
the Union\'s instruments for evolving and complex
scenarios]{.underline}. 116 The [**pandemic** has made the relevance of
anticipatory governance and preparedness more evident than ever before,
as it has illustrated the **compounding effects** that a non-traditional
threat can hold for the deterioration of **peace and
stability**.]{.underline} The Commission acknowledged the [increasing
importance of strategic foresight to equip \'ourselves with the best
possible knowledge on emerging risks\']{.underline} in its 2020 work
programme and by creating a Foresight portfolio in the new Commission,
held by Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič.

4.4.3. [Addressing the future of non-proliferation and nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}

The world has entered a **[\'new nuclear age\']{.underline}** 127 that
is very different from the Cold War, both in terms of characteristics
and challenges. [Two nuclear superpowers, Russia and the USA, still
possess the vast majority of nuclear weapons]{.underline} (see Figure
10). [The greatest challenge still lies in saving the bilateral
agreements between them that have led to a very significant reduction in
nuclear weapons over the past 30 years]{.underline}. However, the number
of nuclear-armed states that determine whether and when nuclear weapons
will be used has grown to include China, India, Israel, Pakistan and
North Korea, and may soon comprise Iran. Pakistan and North Korea rank
high on the list of fragile states (25th and 30th respectively). In this
overall climate, where multilateral arms control has effectively been
declared \'(almost) dead\', 128 [**Europe is at particular risk** that
any renewed arms race between Russia and the USA will play out on
European soil. Moreover, even though the probability is considered low,
there is a persistent risk that a non-state actor may steal and detonate
a nuclear weapon or seek to manufacture an improvised nuclear device.
129]{.underline}

Figure 10 -- Nuclear weapons worldwide Source: SIPRI, 2019. \[Figure

The recent demise of the INF Treaty, 130 a bilateral arms control
agreement between Russia and the USA, may lead to the redeployment of
intermediate-range missiles and put Europe once more in the line of fire
of strategic nuclear weapons, for the first time since 1991. The EU
called on both parties to save the agreement, but these efforts failed.
The last remaining bilateral strategic nuclear arms control agreement
between the USA and Russia, the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(New START), will expire in 2021, unless both parties agree to extend it
as part of negotiations that started in June 2020. New START has been
critical to continuing the trend of gradual reduction in the nuclear
arsenals of the USA and Russia that started in the 1990s. Its demise
could trigger a renewed nuclear arms race between Russia and the USA. At
the same time, all nuclear weaponpossessing states continue to modernise
their nuclear arsenals. The USA and Russia are investing large sumsin
the overhaul of their nuclear weapons systems131 and are working on
introducing \'low yield nuclear weapons\' with a lower threshold for
use. To make matters worse, [the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty, the
**cornerstone of the global non-proliferation** and disarmament regime,
**is under threat**, including from tension between supporters and
opponents of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear
Weapons]{.underline} (the Ban Treaty).

[Based on the Global Strategy for the European Union\'s Foreign and
Security Policy, the **European Union Strategy** against the
Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and their Delivery Systems
and the New Lines for Action, the guiding principle of the EU in the
**fight** **against** the **proliferation** of weapons of mass
destruction (**WMD**) continues to be **effective
multilateralism.**]{.underline} This includes [safeguarding the
centrality and the promotion of the universality of the **global
non-proliferation** and disarmament architecture, through **diplomatic
action** and **financial assistance** to third countries and
international organisations]{.underline}. EU Member States are
signatories to the international treaty regime of non-proliferation
conventions concerning nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. In
addition, [the EU actively promotes the universalisation of these
conventions.]{.underline} However, the EU\'s effectiveness in
maintaining and shaping the future of the international
non-proliferation and disarmament architecture has been weakened due to
internal divisions over the role of nuclear weapons. France is fully
committed to step-by-step nuclear disarmament but considers nuclear
weapons to be an essential part of its security strategies for now. A
further 20 EU Member States are NATO members and covered by NATO\'s
commitment to nuclear deterrence. These include four hosts to US
tactical nuclear weapons (Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands)
and 16 that are covered by NATO\'s \'extended nuclear deterrence
pledges\', including all the central and eastern European Member States.
In contrast, Austria, which is not a NATO member, was one of the key
drivers behind the Humanitarian Initiative, which led to the adoption of
the Ban Treaty. Among EU Member States, only Austria, Cyprus, Ireland,
Malta and Sweden voted in favour of the Ban Treaty, only Austria and
Ireland signed it, and only Austria has ratified it. Consequently, there
is no agreed EU position on the Ban Treaty, reflecting long-standing
division on nuclear disarmament. The [EU will have to **overcome
internal divisions** over the role of nuclear weapons if it wants to
regain the ability to speak with one voice in international
non-proliferation and disarmament fora, give new impetus to the mission
of the EU Special Envoy for Disarmament and Non-proliferation, and be
able to **act autonomously** in an international environment
characterised by an increased assertiveness from both global and
regional powers.]{.underline}

[The EU has been part of several global initiatives at the political
level]{.underline}. [This includes the adoption of UN Security Council
Resolution 1540, which establishes legally binding obligations on all UN
Member States to have and **enforce** appropriate and **effective
measures** against the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and
biological weapons]{.underline}. It also includes the setting up of the
Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT), the creation of
the G7 Non-Proliferation Directors\' Group and Global Partnership, and
the convening of the Nuclear Security Summit. [To strengthen regional
cooperation against proliferation of WMD, the EU launched the EU
Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Risk Mitigation Centres of
Excellence Initiative in 2010]{.underline}. The [EU also pursues close
cooperation with individual countries to strengthen the international
non-proliferation regime]{.underline}. [An **increasing** number of the
**EU\'s bilateral relationships** include a **non-proliferation
component**.]{.underline} The [EU has also contributed to promoting the
highest standards and practices in nuclear safety applied in the EU in
third countries, and continues to promote alignment with EU policies and
priorities in the field of nuclear safety in non-EU
countries.]{.underline} These [efforts have certainly **contributed to
reducing the risk** of non-state actors acquiring nuclear devices or the
nuclear materials needed to manufacture them]{.underline}. However, the
EU will not be able to prevent nuclear-armed states from sharing their
nuclear technology and material with friendly states, as the USA did
with India and Iran, China did with Pakistan, the former Soviet Union
and China did with North Korea, and France with Israel. Both Turkey and
Saudi Arabia have expressed an interest in acquiring nuclear weapons and
nuclearpower competition among the USA, Russia and China may make it
easier for both countries to procure the necessary technology.

[To **prevent the proliferation of WMD**, the EU also controls the
export of **dual-use goods**]{.underline}. Certain goods and
technologies have legitimate civilian applications but can also be used
for military purposes; \'dual-use\' goods are subject to EU\'s export
control regime. [EU export controls reflect commitments agreed upon in
key multilateral export control regimes such as the Australia Group, the
Wassenaar Arrangement, the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Missile
Technology Control Regime]{.underline}. The regime is now being revised,
132 mainly to take account of significant technological developments and
to create a more level playing field among EU Member States. [The EU is
currently considering expanding the definition of dual-use items to
include \'cyber-surveillance technologies\' -- which have been used in
connection with serious human rights violations -- and to create a new
EU autonomous list of cyber-surveillance technology subject to export
control that would be more restrictive than existing multilateral export
control regimes.]{.underline}

### EU CP -- AT Depenpency Deficit

#### Dependency is descriptive of the squo\-\--only strategic autonomy resolves it.

3.1. [Reducing existing dependencies]{.underline}

[The EU is part of a globalised environment characterised by
interdependence, which is at the heart of its multilateral action, and
therefore, of its foreign policy action. Disruptions that transform
interdependencies into dependencies lead to imbalances and could be
countered through the building of an **effective \'strategic
autonomy\'**]{.underline}. [The **greater the dependency** in specific
strategic policy areas the **more vulnerable and unable the EU is to
pursue** its **interests** and defend its values.]{.underline} One
example is the trade relationship with China, which, in the words of
President von der Leyen, is characterised by \'asymmetry\' in market
access and dysfunctionalities as regards the level playing field. A more
robust EU industrial policy and foreign direct investment screening are
toolsthat could contribute to remedy this asymmetry. [They could raise
the EU\'s capacity to act autonomously, not only in relation to China
but also to other partners.]{.underline}

[The coronavirus outbreak highlighted some of the EU\'s dependency on
China for health equipment and medicine supply]{.underline}. It has
shown how vulnerable the EU could be when it comes to a strategic domain
such as the health sector. [As argued previously in this study, the
pandemic could offer a unique opportunity to build **political
consensus** **on \'strategic autonomy\'** and place it at the centre of
the recovery process.]{.underline} This makes it important to act, not
only on health policy, but also concomitantly on climate and energy,
industrial policy, foreign policy, development, economic affairs,
monetary policy, defence, international trade, transport,
infrastructure, artificial intelligence, research or intellectual
property rights. [Each of these domains is of strategic importance for
an EU that, unless it builds its capacity to act autonomously, risks
being caught in the middle of the game of global powers at a crucial
juncture.]{.underline}

[Reducing dependencies is not an easy exercise; it **requires**
maintaining and **renewing the existing political
consensus**]{.underline}. [Quick legal or institutional solutions might
be tempting, but these solutions only represent the means of reducing
dependency and must come second -- as a way to implement **political
will**]{.underline}. In practice, the European Council has first to
reach, and then to maintain, a political consensus on the formulation
and implementation of policies, to ensure that the Member States fully
adhere to the whole process. [An interesting example is the EDF, the
creation of which would have been impossible without a prior **political
consensus** forged at the European Council on the need to **share the
burden of transatlantic security** and **address the growing risk** of
technological obsolescence in Europe]{.underline}. The EDF -- a
dedicated instrument [intended to boost European defence research and
defence industry -- can only prove its added value and contribute
significantly to the **building of the EU\'s strategic
autonomy21**]{.underline} if it is provided with sufficient resources in
the years to come (see also section 4.4.2).
