The debate on empire is back. [This is not surprising, as the United
States dominates the world as no state ever has.]{.underline} It emerged
from the Cold War the only superpower, and no geopolitical or
ideological contenders are in sight. Europe is drawn inward, and Japan
is stagnant. A half century after their occupation, the United States
still provides security for Japan and Germany-the world\'s second- and
third-largest economies. U.S. military bases and carrier battle groups
ring the world. Russia is in a quasi-formal security partnership with
the United States, and China has accommodated itself to U.S. dominance,
at least for the moment. For the first time in the modern era, the
world\'s most powerful state can operate on the global stage without the
constraints of other great powers. We have entered the American unipolar
age. The Bush administration\'s war on terrorism, invasions of
Afghanistan and Iraq, expanded military budget, and controversial 2002
National Security Strategy have thrust American power into the light of
day-and, in doing so, deeply unsettled much of the world. Worry about
the implications of American uni polarity is the not-so-hidden subtext
of recent U.S.-European tension and has figured prominently in recent
presidential elections in Germany, Brazil, and South Korea. The most
fundamental questions about the nature of global politics-who commands
and who benefits-are now the subject of conversation among long-time
allies and adversaries alike. Power is often muted or disguised, but
when it is exposed and perceived as domination, it inevitably invites
response. One recalls the comment of Georges Clemenceau, who as a young
politician said of the settlement ending the Franco Prussian War,
\"Germany believes that the logic of her victory means domination, while
we do not believe that the logic of our defeat is serfdom.\" At
Versailles a half-century later, he would impose just as harsh a peace
on a defeated Germany. The current debate over empire is an attempt to
make sense of the new uni polar reality. The assertion that the United
States is bent on empire is, of course, not new. The British writer and
labor politician Harold Laski evoked the looming Amer ican empire in
1947 when he said that \"America bestrides the world like a colossus;
neither Rome at the height of its power nor Great Britain in the period
of economic supremacy enjoyed an influence so direct, so profound, or so
pervasive\....\" And in deed, Dean Acheson and other architects of the
postwar order were great admirers of the British Empire. Later, during
the Vietnam War, left-wing thinkers and revisionist historians traced
the same deep-rooted impulse toward militarism and empire through the
history of U.S. foreign policy. The dean of this school, William
Appleton Williams, argued in The Tragedy of American Diplomacy that the
nation\'s genuine idealism had been subverted by the imperial pursuit of
power and capitalist greed. Today, the \"American empire\" is a term of
approval and optimism for some and disparagement and danger for others.
[Neoconservatives celebrate the imperial exercise of U.S. power, which,
in a modern version of Rudyard Kipling\'s \"white man\'s burden,\" is a
liberal force that promotes democracy and undercuts tyranny, terrorism,
military aggression, and weapons proliferation.]{.underline} Critics who
identify an emerging American empire, meanwhile, worry about its
unacceptable financial costs, its corrosive effect on democracy, and the
threat it poses to the institutions and alliances that have secured U.S.
national interests since World War II. THE \"E\" WORD No one disagrees
that U.S. power is extraordinary. It is the character and logic of U.S.
domination that is at issue in the debate over empire. [[The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is not just]{.mark} [a superpower
pursuing its interest; it is a producer of world
order.]{.mark}]{.underline} Over the decades-with more support than
resistance from other nations-it has fashioned a distinctively open and
rule-based international order. Its dynamic bundle of oversized
capacities, interests, and ideals constitutes an \"American project\"
with unprecedented global reach. For better or worse, other states must
come to terms with or work around this protean order. [Scholars often
characterize international relations as the interaction of sovereign
states in an anarchic world.]{.underline} In the classic Westphalian
world order, states hold a monopoly on the use of force in their own
territory while order at the international level is maintained through
the diffusion of power among states. [[Today\'s unipolar world turns the
Westphalian image on its head.]{.underline}]{.mark} The United States
possesses a near-monopoly on the use of force internationally; on the
domestic level, meanwhile, the institutions and behaviors of states are
increasingly open to global-that is, American-scrutiny. Since September
11th, the Bush administration\'s assertion of \"contingent sovereignty\"
and the right of preemption have made this transformation abundantly
clear. [[The rise of unipolarity and the simultaneous unbundling of
state sovereignty is a new and volatile brew. But is the
resulting]{.mark} political [formation an empire]{.mark}? And if so,
will the American empire suffer the fate of great empires of the past:
ravaging the world with its ambitions and excesses until overextension,
miscalculation, and mounting opposition hasten its
collapse?]{.underline} The term \"empire\" refers to the political
control by a dominant country of the domestic and foreign policies of
weaker countries. The European colonial empires of the late nineteenth
century were the most direct, formal kind. The Soviet \"sphere of
influence\" in Eastern Europe entailed an equally coercive but less
direct form of control. The British Empire included both direct colonial
rule and \"informal empire.\" If empire is defined loosely, as a
hierarchical system of political relationships in which the most
powerful state exercises decisive influence, then the United States
today indeed qualifies. [[If the United States is an empire]{.mark}, how
ever, [it is like no other before it]{.mark}. To be sure, it has a long
tradition of pursuing crude imperial policies, most notably in Latin
America and the Middle East. But for most countries, the [U.S.-led order
is a negotiated system wherein the United States has sought
participation by other states on terms that are mutually agreeable. This
is true in three respects]{.mark}. First, [the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has provided public goods particularly the extension of
security and the support for an open trade regime in exchange for the
cooperation of other states. Second, power in the U.S. system is
exercised through rules and institutions]{.mark}; power politics still
exist, but [arbitrary]{.mark} and indiscriminate [power is reigned
in]{.mark}. Finally, weaker [states]{.mark} in the U.S.-led order [are
given]{.mark} \"voice opportunities\"-[informal access to the
policymaking processes of the United States and the intergovernmental
institutions that make up the international system.]{.mark}]{.underline}
It is these features of the post-194S international order that have led
historians such as Charles Maier to talk about a \"consensual empire\"
and Geir Lundestad to talk about an \"empire of invitation.\" The
American order is hierarchical and ultimately sustained by economic and
military power, but it is put at the service of an expanding system of
democracy and capitalism.Fundamentally, then, the debate over the new
American empire hinges on how extensive and deeply rooted these
characteristics are-and whether its assertion of power since September
11 constitutes a fundamental break with this liberal past. THE GLOBAL
RACKET In The Sorrows of Empire, Chalmers Johnson advances the
disturbing claim that the United States\' Cold War-era military power
and far-flung base system have, in the last decade, been consolidated in
a new form of global imperial rule. The United States, according to
Johnson has become \"a military juggernaut intent on world domination.\"
Driven by a triumphalist ideology, an exaggerated sense of threats, and
a self serving military-industrial complex, this juggernaut is
tightening its grip on much of the world. The Pentagon has replaced the
State Department as the primary shaper of foreign policy. Military
commanders in regional headquarters are modern-day proconsuls,
warrior-diplomats who direct the United States\' imperial reach. Johnson
fears that this military empire will corrode democracy, bankrupt the
nation, spark opposition, and ultimately end in a Soviet-style collapse.
In this rendering, the American military empire is a novel form of
domination. Johnson describes it as an \"international protection
racket: mutual defense treaties, military advisory groups, and military
forces stationed in foreign countries to \'defend\' against often poorly
defined, overblown, or nonexistent threats.\" These arrangements create
\"satellites\"-Ostensibly independent countries whose foreign relations
revolve around the imperial state. Johnson argues that this variety of
empire was pioneered during the Cold War by the Soviet Union in Eastern
Europe and the United States in East Asia. Great empires of the past-the
Romans and the Han Dynasty Chinese-ruled their domains with permanent
military encampments that garrisoned conquered territory. The American
empire is innovative because it is not based on the acquisition of
territory; it is an empire of bases. Johnson\'s previous polemic,
Blowback, asserted that post-1945 U.S. spheres of influence in East Asia
and Latin America were as coercive and exploitative as their Soviet
counterparts. The Sorrows of Empire continues this dubious line. Echoing
1960s revisionism, Johnson asserts that the United States\' Cold War
security system of alliances and bases was built on manufactured threats
and driven by expansionary impulses. The United States was not acting in
its own defense; it was exploiting opportunities to build an empire. The
Soviet Union and the United States, according to this argument, were
more alike than different: both militarized their societies and foreign
policies and expanded outward, establishing imperial rule through \"hub
and spoke\" systems of client states and political dependencies. In
Johnson\'s view, the end of the Cold War represented both an opportunity
and a crisis for U.S. global rule-an opportunity because the Soviet
sphere of influence was now open for imperial expansion, a crisis
because the fall of the Soviet Union ended the justification for the
global system of naval bases, airfields, army garrisons, espionage
listening posts, and strategic enclaves. Only with the terrorist attacks
of September 11th was this crisis resolved. Bush suddenly had an excuse
to expand U.S. military domination. September 11 also allowed the United
States to remove the fig leaf of alliance partnership. Washington could
now disentangle itself from international commitments, treaties, and law
and launch direct imperial rule. Unfortunately, [Johnson offers no
coherent theory of why the United States seeks empire. At one point, he
suggests that the American military empire is founded on \"a vast
complex of interests, commitments, and projects.\" The empire of bases
has become institutionalized in the military establishment and has taken
on a life of its own. There is no discussion, however, of the forces
within U.S. politics that resist or reject empire. As a result, Johnson
finds imperialism everywhere and in everything the United States does,
in its embrace of open markets and global economic integration as much
as in its pursuit of narrow economic gains. Johnson also offers little
beyond passing mention about the societies presumed to be under
Washington\'s thumb. Domination and exploitation are, of course, not
always self-evident. Military pacts and security partnerships are
clearly part of the structure of U.S. global power, and they often rein
force fragile and corrupt governments in order to project U.S.
influence. But countries can also use security ties with the United
States to their own advantage. Japan may be a subordinate security part
ner, but the U.S.-Japan alliance also allows Tokyo to forgo a costly
buildup of military capacity that would destabilize East Asia.
[Moreover, countries do have other options: they can, and often do,
escape U.S. domination]{.mark} simply [by asking the United States to
leave. The Philippines did so, and South Korea may be next.]{.mark} The
variety and complexity of U.S. security ties with other states makes
Johnson\'s simplistic view of military hegemony misleading. In fact, the
U.S. alliance system remarkably intact after half a century-has helped
create a stable, open political space. Cooperative [security]{.mark} is
not just an instrument of U.S. domination; it [is]{.mark} also [a tool
of political architecture]{.mark}.]{.underline} But Johnson neglects the
broader complex of U.S.-supported multilateral rules and institutions
that give depth and complexity to the international order. Ultimately,
it is not clear what the United States could do-short of retreating into
its borders or ceasing to exist-that would save it from Johnson\'s
condemnation. PAX AMERICANA In Colossus, Niall Ferguson argues that the
United States is indeed an empire and has been for a long time. To
Ferguson, however, it is a liberal empire that upholds rules and
institutions and underwrites public goods by maintaining peace, ensuring
freedom of the seas and skies, and managing a system of international
trade and finance. The United States is the imperfect but natural
inheritor of the British system of global governance; it is open and
integrative and inclined toward informal rule. Accordingly, Ferguson\'s
worry is not that the world will get too much American empire but that
it will not get enough. U.S. leaders, for all their benign intent, have
unusually short attention spans and tend to go \"wobbly.\" In
Ferguson\'s view, the United States shares many characteristics with
past empires. Like Rome, it has remarkably open citizenship. \"Purple
Hearts and U.S. citizenship were conferred simultaneously on a number of
the soldiers serving in Iraq last year, just as service in the legions
was once a route to becoming a civis romanus,\" Ferguson writes.
\"Indeed, with the classical architecture of its capital and the
republican structure of its constitution, the United States is perhaps
more like a \'new Rome\' than any previous empire-albeit a Rome in which
the Senate has thus far retained its grip on would-be emperors.\" The
spread of America\'s language, ideas, and culture also invites
comparison to Rome at its zenith. But Ferguson is even more taken by
parallels with the British Empire. U.S. presidents, from Woodrow Wilson,
Franklin Roosevelt, and John F. Kennedy to Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton,
and George W. Bush, have put their power work promoting the great
liberal ideals of economic openness, democracy, limited government,
human dignity, and the rule of law-a \"strategy of openness\" that is
remarkably similar, Ferguson argues, to the aspirations of the British
Empire in the second half of the nineteenth century. After all, it was a
young Winston Churchill who argued that the aim of British imperialism
was to \"give peace to warring tribes, to administer justice where all
was violence, to strike the chains off the slave, to draw the richness
from the soil, to place the earliest seeds of commerce and learning, to
increase in whole peoples their capacities for pleasure and diminish
their chances of pain\.... \" Most of Colossus retells the familiar
story of the rise of U.S. global dominance as an exercise in liberal
empire. What is distinctive about American imperialism, according to
Ferguson, is that it has been pursued in the name of anti-imperialism.
For each phase of U.S. history, Ferguson nicely illuminates the tensions
between republican ideals and the exercise of global power and shows how
those tensions are often resolved. The Cold War-and George Kennan\'s
doctrine of containment-provides the ultimate example of this fusion of
anti-imperialism and hard power. Security, openness, democratic
community, political commitment, and the mobilization of U.S. power went
together. The core of U.S. global rule involved the enforcement of rules
of economic openness, but the United States was also willing to act
forcefully to integrate countries into the liberal order. [Ferguson\'s
most interesting claim is that the world needs more of this liberal
American empire. This argument stems in part from the uncontroversial
claim that the current international order needs enlightened leadership
and that only Washington can provide it.]{.underline} (Ferguson holds
little hope that Europe will ever overcome its preoccupation with the
internal contradictions of its enlargement.) It is especially the wider
system of sovereign but failed states that needs imperial supervision by
Washington. In vast swatches of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East
national self determination has led to much grief. Ferguson argues
without qualification that \"the experiment with political
independence-especially in Africa-has been a disaster for most poor
countries.\" To Ferguson, the extension of liberal empire into these
regions (even involving some form of colonial rule) is necessary. What
precisely these imperial arrangements would look like, however, remains
unclear. When Ferguson says that he is \"fundamentally in favor of
empire,\" he is to some extent pulling a conceptual sleight of hand.
What Ferguson means by \"liberal empire\" scholars have previously
called \"liberal hegemony\": a hierarchical order that is still very
different from traditional forms of empire. By virtue of its power, the
liberal hegemon can act on its long-term interests rather than squabble
over short-term gains with other states; it can identify its own
national interests with the openness and stability of the larger system.
The United States thus shapes and dominates the international order
while guaranteeing a flow of benefits to other governments that earns
their acquiescence. In contrast to empire, this negotiated order depends
on agreement over the rules of the system between the leading state and
everyone else. In this way, the norms and institutions that have
developed around U.S. hegemony both limit the actual coercive exercise
of U.S. power and draw other states into the management of the system.
Ferguson\'s case for the virtues of American empire hinges on his claim
that in the aftermath of the Soviet Union\'s collapse, the world could
have gone one of two ways: international order organized around
independent nations or an American imperium. He maintains that a world
of decentralized, competing states, many of which are not democracies,
would result in chaos. This may be true; he is certainly right that
stability and open markets are not easily sustained without the support
of powerful states. [But [the notion of liberal empire conflates very
different types of U.S.-led order. One in which Washington coerces other
states into obedience is very different from a system of multilateral
rules and close partnerships]{.mark}. The [challenges of peace and
economic development]{.mark} that Ferguson identifies [are best pursued
by advanced democracies working together]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Ultimately, such a cooperative order would require that Washington
transcend the atavistic habits of empire rather than pursue a more
complete realization of it. In the end, Ferguson finds invoking the
image of empire useful for political reasons. Unlike the British,
Americans do not believe that they operate an empire. As a result, the
United States makes a flighty and impatient imperial power (in contrast
to the British, who acquired a cultural mentality for global rule).
Ferguson thinks that speaking honestly about the reality of American
empire will foster understanding of its duties and obligations. Yet
precisely the opposite is true. The United States does not need to view
the world as its Raj and deploy a colonial service to the vast
periphery; it needs to find ways to exercise its power in sustained,
legitimate ways, working with others and developing more complex forms
of cooperative international governance. It is also extremely doubtful
that the American people would accept such a massive imperial
undertaking: last September, as soon as President Bush revealed the
price tag for occupying Iraq, public support plummeted immediately.

### Thesis -- Empire = Wrong

#### Empire fails to account for 9/11 and events afterwards, making it useless in a contemporary context.

**Moore '03** (David, Hardt and Negri\'s Empire and Real Empire: The
Terrors of 9-11 and After,
<https://acme-journal.org/index.php/acme/article/download/689/553/>

Are We All New Yorkers? [It is [ironic for Empire]{.mark} readers
[that]{.mark} the horror of [9-11 happened in the centre of the
empire]{.mark} so vividly [portrayed]{.mark} in that book.]{.underline}
The Twin Towers symbolised everything Empire discussed. From the
earth-encompassing power of finance capital, to internet capitalism's
connection and compression of space and time, and to the cosmopolitan
nature of the workers there, the towers were the epitome of everything
Empire loved and hated about the world today. Antonio Negri said 'we are
all New Yorkers' in an interview after 9-11 (Cocco and Lazarrato 2002)
and it is clear that the book he and Michael Hardt produced really does
see the whole world as if it was New York. [[For Hardt and Negri, the
global 'multitude' is composed of]{.mark} urban (and urbane)
[citizens]{.mark} whose autonomy and hybridity make institutions such as
states, and ideologies such as religions, evaporate into the mists of
the immaterial labour that now drive the world. The multitude's labour
is impossible to measure, so all of its members have equal value (cf.
Resnick and Wolff 2001; Dyer-Witherford 2001) [and they all really want
the same thing]{.mark}. Be they waiters in the Greenwich Village cafés,
analysts for the currency speculators on Wall Street, or professors at
Columbia University -- or at similar sites in New York's image anywhere
in the world [-- sometime soon they will all oppose capitalist
exploitation and national oppression, replacing them with the joys of
being a communist]{.mark}]{.underline}. The kind of resistance that
brought the Twin Towers down, however, forces the irony to take an
awkward and bitter twist[. [Al-Queda hardly represents the postmodern
enemies of post-imperialism]{.mark} envisaged (for the most part) in
Empire. [Empire's sweep is so vast and so fast that]{.mark} religion,
nationalism and any of the other [forces inspiring]{.mark} Osama
[bin-Laden]{.mark} and his many followers [are in the
dustbin]{.mark}.]{.underline} When these forces revisit the postmodern
world their aspirations are 'incommunicable' (Hardt and Negri 2000, 54,
Hardt and Negri 2001a; Negri 2002): it is as if they have arisen from
the dead. Contrary to Empire, however, they dealt New York and -- more
importantly but also almost erased from the book -- the state within
which the city is ensconced a blow that catalysed a form of empire Hardt
and Negri thought had disappeared. A 'one state beats all' form of
imperial power has arisen from the ashes of Twin Towers. It is now
wreaking terror in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq and chilling the
hearts of European politicians and United Nations multilateralists --
and it inspired 15 million members of the 'multitude' to demonstrate.
[But the [people who guided]{.mark} their passenger-packed [planes into
the Twin Towers were not]{.mark} 'New Yorkers' [in]{.mark} the mold of
[Hardt and Negri's multitude. Nor were]{.mark} most of [those]{.mark} in
Iraq [on whom bombs rained]{.mark} and American troops shot in March and
April 2003. [Neither are the Americans who supported the
campaign]{.mark}. The [actions, beliefs and structures]{.mark} of the
world in the [post 9-11]{.mark} era [are significantly different
from]{.mark} those inscribed in Hardt and Negri's [Empire]{.mark} -- as
is the etiology of the event.]{.underline} There are three ways to
assess Empire's inability to foresee the world in the wake of 9-11. I
list and analyse them in reverse order of theoretical priority
(indicated in the abstract) because the spectacle of such an event as
9-11 demands that in this instance the 'epiphenomenal' comes first
(Campbell 2001). Firstly, the act of terrorism that destroyed the Twin
Towers and killed the approximately 3,000 people within it must be
analysed in terms of the way in which Hardt and Negri understand the
nature of resistance to global capitalism (or, in their lexicon, 'the
informational mode of production'). Their uncertainty about the agents
and strategies of resistance lends ambiguity to their thinking about
9-11 and similar events. Secondly, the importance of the 'state' as a
structure within both core and peripheral components of global society
must be re-stated and theorised in the light of Empire's elision of that
task. [The [contradictions]{.mark} inherent in state formation [in the
third world combined with]{.mark} those of the construction and
maintenance of American [empire]{.mark} in the current global
conjuncture [create]{.mark} both the terror of '[resistance']{.mark}
from below [and]{.mark} '[régime change']{.mark} from above. [Hardt and
Negri]{.mark} tend to [wish these complexities away]{.mark} in their
construction of a world full of libertarian flows of desire and capital.
The 'terror from above' that has been visited on Afghanistan and Iraq in
the wake of 9-11 suggests the [increasing dominance of American state
power]{.mark} qua state power, [instead of the erasure]{.mark} of such
authority [as predicted]{.mark} in Empire. Thirdly -- and most
critically in terms of structural fundamentals -- it is necessary to
undertake a foundational 'political economy' critique deconstructing
Hardt and Negri's assessment of the nature of the global capitalist
system. Their hasty [ironing out]{.mark} of the [fundamentally uneven
development]{.mark} of the global complex of state-society formations
[is]{.mark} simply [unsustainable]{.mark} when one gets down to the
'nitty-gritty' of political economy.]{.underline} Empire smoothes out
all of the contradictions of 'third world' development in spite of
itself. This myopia regarding the underdeveloped world is at the root of
Hardt and Negri's too exuberant celebration of global cyber-capitalism
-- and thus also at the centre of their erasure of the state and their
misunderstanding of the resistanceterror nexus. This essay will thus
reposition empire on the 'real world' rather than the ethereal one
created in Empire -- while acknowledging that much of the required
rethinking has been inspired by the simultaneously frustrating and
stimulating book.

### Turn -- Anthro

#### Turn - Empire's concept of biopower is anthropocentric and reductionist.

**Youatt '08** (R, August 2008, Counting Species: Biopower and the
Global Biodiversity Census, <https://www.jstor.org/stable/30302207>
(Accessed 7/14/2022), Department of Political Science Reed College
Environmental Values Vol. 17 No. 3) //**Doof**

Driven both by the global loss of biodiversity and by the lack of
knowledge about the vast majority of species that are being lost,
conservation biologists and some of their allies in the environmental
movement have called for and started a massive global census of
biodiversity.1 Most prominently, E.O. Wilson has proposed a new
mobilisation of scientific resources to complete a global survey of
species.2 The identification of biodiversity ʻhotspotsʼ is the first
step in a cascade of biodiversity investigation, Wilson hopes, which
will culminate in a full inventory of global biodiversity and of the
places where it is being lost. With complete information about the
global population of biological species, Wilson is optimistic that we
can undertake more refined conservation measures and ultimately move
towards greater sustainability. In this article, I take the position
that the global biodiversity census is as much about power and political
life and the boundaries between nature and society as it is about
scientific information gathering for conservationist ends. [Drawing on
Foucaultʼs concept of biopower, I suggest that the biodiversity census
provokes us to think about the ways that [biological nonhumans]{.mark}
are embroiled in, and [challenge]{.mark}, the [technologies of power
that see life itself as a political object]{.mark}. To the extent that
the [ʻactionʼ in]{.mark} the [biod]{.mark}iversity census seems to [rest
largely with]{.mark} the [human scientists]{.mark} who do the
categorising, naming, counting, and labelling of nonhuman species, one
analytic stance towards **[this]{.mark} scientific [practice is]{.mark}
an [anthropocentric]{.mark} one.** Here, the focus is on considering the
field of social power in which scientific efforts take place, and asking
questions about the discourses, resources and networks that make a
biodiversity census plausible and possible. But **[what if nonhumans can
be]{.mark} legitimately [considered]{.mark} to be [active
participants]{.mark}** in the field of biopower, just as human subjects
who are censused are?]{.underline} Can nonhumans be sites of resistance
to biopower, and disrupt its governing impulses? I argue that it is
possible, and indeed necessary in the context of biodiversity, to extend
the idea of biopower to include nonhumans as participants. [Like human
subjects, [nonhumans are regulated]{.mark} and rationalised in matrices
of knowledge and science, through which they are [readied as]{.mark}
productive [resources for capitalism and]{.mark} mined as repositories
of [genetic info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}. Nonhuman participation in
an ecological field of biopower also involves being part of an array of
authority in environmental discourses, with effects for both humans and
nonhumans, and constructing new possibilities for biosocial collectives.
However, because nonhumans generally lack the capacity to be
self-regulating subjects but are nonetheless necessary authorities in
figuring biodiversity truth discourses, I suggest that they hold a
different kind of place in biopower than self-regulating human subjects
do. [More specifically, because [nonhumans]{.mark} constitutionally
(rather than intentionally) refuse to internalise the meanings of human
language, they [are able to]{.mark} resist becoming self-regulating
subjects to a significant extent, relying instead on their own semiotic
interpretations of the environment and acting accordingly: for example,
through migrating, reproduc- ing, consuming resources and filling
ecological niches in unexpected ways, biotic nonhumans are constantly
[challeng]{.mark}ing the normalising will of
[biopower]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the same time, because environmental
interventions to save species come to be justified on the grounds of
global environmental well-being, the health and continued existence of
nonhumans becomes an increasing imperative. In spite of the fact the
biodiversity census may extend the reach of an ecologically unfriendly
capitalism, I conclude that it will, on balance, reap important
ecological goods in hybridising political practice and acknowledging
extra-human locations of power. The article proceeds as follows. I start
in Section 1 by reviewing the global biodiversity census proposal. In
section 2, I consider how scientific power is extended through the
census and what sources of power it draws on to do so. The science of
censusing nonhumans requires a significant mobilisation of social power
-- financial, technological, institutional and discursive -- in order to
succeed. But because knowledge projects like demography have effects and
techniques that reach beyond these sources of social power into life
itself, I suggest that we cannot fully explain the importance of the
biodiversity census through these means. In section 3, therefore, I
extend Foucaultʼs concept of biopower into the nonhuman world as a means
to explain the productive power and regulatory qualities of the census.
Because the subjects of the biodiversity census are mostly nonhuman,
however, I also consider how the concept of biopower mutates in light of
their participation. 1. THE GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY CENSUS PROPOSAL Spurred
by the problem of a major extinction event in which we do not even know
what or how much is being lost, the basic knowledge-problem that the
global biodiversity census is aimed at addressing is counting and
describing all the species that currently exist in the world. According
to the United Nations Environmental Programʼs (UNEP) Global Biodiversity
Assessment, the best ecological estimates of extant species range from
3.5 million all the way to 111.5 million species, with the most likely
figure at around 13.5 million.3 Only 1.75 million of those species are
currently identified and described, however, or about 13 per cent.4 Each
year, only 13,000 new species are formally described, a snailʼs pace
given the magnitude of the task.5 Even when species have been described,
the data often remains limited. Some species may have become extinct
since being identified. May et al., for example, estimate that about 40
per cent of identified beetle species are known from a single
examination in a single locality, sometimes an observation made decades
ago.6 E.O. Wilsonʼs census proposal includes training and deploying a
cadre of thousands of specialists in systematics, taxonomy and
classification. He calculates that given 40 years of productive
classification work per scientist, at the pace of ten species identified
per year, approximately 25,000 professional lifetimes are needed, a
number which ʻfalls well short of the number of enlisted men in the
standing armed forces of Mongolia, not to mention the trade and retail
personnel of Hinds County, Mississippiʼ.7 In the perfectly rational
system that he hopes for, each expert would be assigned to a specific
classificatory activity. While there are currently only three people in
the world who are sufficiently expert in classifying termites, for
example, Wilson would up their number proportionally to match the fact
that termites comprise ten per cent of the total biomass of tropical
regions. Wilson also champions investment in new computer technology
that can combine scanning-electron microscopes with image-recognition
software. Its goal would be to process and identify species instantly
and to flag new specimens as they are passed through. The data held in
the GenBank project, a computer database aimed at collecting information
on all known DNA and RNA sequences, could be folded into this process.
Given the massive numbers of species and the difficulty of resource
mobilisation, other proposals suggest sampling procedures to get
representative data on the global biopopulation. For example, Terry
Erwin suggests that we aim for ʻmassive but achievable biotic
inventoriesʼ that give us a relative fix on biodiversity.8 While it may
not achieve Wilsonʼs goal of describing all species, targeting specific
taxa and sampling certain species would have the effect of rationalising
what is currently an ad hoc process. In the face of an ever larger human
population, the United States census now makes limited use of
representative sampling procedures, which its proponents argue make it
more accurate than a large-scale but flawed collection of data about
every individual.9 A global biodiversity census would aim to do the
same. Some of the questions that surround the biodiversity census are
scientific ones, such as concerns over the basic species concepts it
employs and the problems of scale involved in identifying micro-species
like bacteria.10 Given that the activities of science are not
self-contained but always embedded in social relations, additional kinds
of questions need to be asked, however. Yet little scholarly attention
has been paid to what this biodiversity censusing effort means in
political or social terms. Political ecologists have usefully inquired
into the general effects of biodiversity discourses and the ways in
which they are intertwined with regimes of power and governmentality,11
but they have not asked whether there is anything specific about the
language and practice of censusing nonhuman bio-entities that is
politically important. Environmental ethicists seem to have ignored the
ethical dimensions of the topic altogether.12 Anthropologists and
ethnobotanists have looked increasingly at the relationship between
biological and cultural diversity, finding strong geographical and
evolutionary correlations between the two and suggesting that a broader
biocultural value linking nature and humans might be found in diversity
complexes.13 However, they have not inquired into the importance of
censusing as a technique by which the differences in biocultures might
be constituted. Political scientists have written extensively and
insightfully about the practice and effects of censusing human
populations,14 but have not taken up how censusing nonhumans relates to
political questions about power. The rest of the article aims to fill
some of these gaps, particularly with respect to questions of how power
functions in contemporary environmental science and politics. 2. THE
BIODIVERSITY CENSUS AND THE SOCIAL POWER OF SCIENTISTS Taken as a
socially-embedded activity, the production of successful scientific
knowledge necessarily requires mobilisation of economic resources,
expansion of institutional power, and discursive legitimation.15
Successful science, in other words, must be socially forged. This point
does not suggest that the status of scientific truth-claims is fully
dependent on social interests; rather, the point is that thinking about
a scientific activity like the biodiversity census requires attending
not only to activities of classification and arguments over species
concepts, but also to how those activities are made possible in the
first place. In short, what kind of social power does the biodiversity
census draw on, depend on and reproduce? What makes the use of a
biodiversity census seem intuitively obvious as the right tool to
address biodiversity loss? Here, I consider two forms of social power,
both crucial to the census project. First, I ask what financial and
institutional resources are necessary to allow agenda-setting power and
the capacity to steer future resources in advantageous ways.16 Second, I
suggest the allure of the census rests partly on the way that
biodiversity scientists are able to tap into discursive power,
particularly the seductive power of discourses like panopticism and
discovery.17 I consider these forms of power in turn. The institutional
push for a global biodiversity census is centred in the United States,
where it has harnessed major sources of funding, including the National
Science Foundation (a \$14 million fund for ʻplanetary biodiversity
inventoriesʼ), the Packard Foundation and Harvard University. It has
created a network of scientific-political organisations mainly based in
the United States and Europe dedicated to censusing different parts of
the natural world and promoting the ʻcompletion of the Linnaean
enterpriseʼ18 into a ʻCatalogue of Lifeʼ -- the Census of Marine Life,
NatureServe, the Global Taxonomy Initiative of the Convention on
Biodiversity, Species 2000 and the All-Species Foundation. There has
been increased funding for the academic fields of taxonomy and
bioinformatics.19 New professional lives have opened up around these
resources -- ʻeach species merits careers of scientific study and
celebration by historians and poetsʼ, as Wilson puts it.20 The
biodiversity census makes these possible first through the act of
species identification and then through the subsequent study of species
behaviour, ecological roles and potential uses for humanity. The key
institutions of the global biodiversity census are organised around
information and communications technologies, which worm their way right
into the names and missions of the organisations involved. The Global
Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the Integrated Taxonomic
Information System (ITIS) (in partnership with US federal agencies
including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA)) are two of the global
clearinghouses for establishing quality specieslevel data, aiming to be
ʻopen portalsʼ of biodiversity data.21 GBIFʼs mission is to ʻdevelop
methods for sustainably using biodiversity ... \[by\] rapidly, openly,
and freely delivering primary data about biodiversity to everyone in the
global community, using digital technologiesʼ.22 The political intent is
universal access, while its method of delivery is technological. The
universally-wired nature of ʻtheʼ global community is taken for granted,
even as a global digital divide and the barriers of expertise suggest
that no such community exists. One critical role that information
technology plays in organising the global biodiversity census is in its
ability to suggest a panoptic biological future.23 ʻImagine an
electronic page for each species of organism on Earthʼ, Wilson asks us,
ʻavailable everywhere by single access on commandʼ.24 Genealogically
related to projects like Diderotʼs Encylopedie, the modern ʻEncyclopedia
of Lifeʼ is the endpoint and ultimate goal of the censusing project,
organised in a technology that claims to outrun space and time. The
rhetoric of ʻachievingʼ a global biodiversity census also taps into
complex Western narratives of discovery and conquest of nature
(ironically, since the conservation agenda of the census is aimed in
part at preserving the wildness of nature). This rhetoric also draws on
the position of social power held by the modern sciences to reveal the
unknown to human publics. Wilson exhorts supporters of the census to
have ʻfaith in the sprint to the finish of the global censusʼ, promising
that ʻunknown microorganisms \... will be revealedʼ and that ʻnever
again, with fuller knowledge of such extent, need we overlook so many
golden opportunities in the living world around usʼ.25 Similarly, the
All-Species Foundation tells us that the global biodiversity census
ʻoffers an unsurpassable adventure: the exploration of a little-known
planetʼ.26 Finally, the discursive power of the census is connected to
economic life, in the way that it renders nonhuman agents ready for
postmodern capitalism as semiotic constructions (as in genetic codes for
bioprospectors or images in nature videos).27 As Arturo Escobar argues,
whereas ʻnatureʼ marked modern capitalismʼs attitude towards the
nonhuman, ʻbiodiversityʼ is a term of postmodern capitalism, in the way
that it readies nonhuman nature for semiotic use rather than material
use.28 Indeed, postmodern capitalism may protect nature materially even
as it commodifies it semiotically, as in the case of protecting the
Amazon rainforest for its pharmaceutical potentials.29 Yet, as Escobar
argues, ʻonce the semiotic conquest of nature is completed, the
sustainable and rational use of the environment becomes imperativeʼ.30
That is, once biodiversity discourses help conserve an area as a
biodiversity reserve which is made valuable in terms of code-commodity,
it also becomes part of a political system of global environmental
governance that continues to manage it for capitalism. Thus,
conservation biologists have mobilised an expanding pool of financial
and institutional resources, drawing in part on the seductive qualities
of the dream of panopticism and the historical glory of exploration. To
the extent that the agenda of global environmental governance is steered
by their expertise, consensus and public statements,31 they have also
garnered increased authority in speaking about matters of conservation,
ecotourism and economic development. While these forms of social power
(institutional, financial, technological, discursive) explain some of
what is at stake in the biodiversity census, I want to suggest that the
power of a global biodiversity census also rests in its hybridising
force. It introduces nonhumans into the discursive heart of an otherwise
anthropocentric modern human politics, economy and knowledge that has
generally denied that nonhumans have formed a part of these projects.32
It creates a framework through which humans interact with, pattern and
position the diversity of natural nonhumans. Understanding the
importance of the biodiversity census therefore extends questions of
power past its traditional human context into an ecological context. The
important questions, then, are: for whom does this extended politics and
power work?33 What happens to anthropocentric understandings of power
upon the participation of nonhumans in the process? Does the
(re)introduction of nonhumans tell us anything about the ʻwhereabouts of
powerʼ, to use John Allenʼs phrase?34 Can power be nearly everywhere, or
does it have a specifically local character in relations between things
and thus an uneven distribution? To answer these questions, I turn to
the idea of Foucaultian biopower, which considers how power works at the
micro-levels of individual life, in relation to the more traditional
forms of power considered thus far. 3. BIOPOWER AND THE CENSUS In this
section, I start by considering how human censuses are understood to
relate to politics and governing institutions, specifically through the
Foucaultian idea of biopower. Because biopower is concerned with the
ways that techniques like censusing operate on the terrain of ʻlife
itselfʼ, it is particularly suited to thinking about the biodiversity
census, which similarly involves a strategy for administering and
rationalising life in ways that reach into nonhuman biological life as
such.35 The consideration of censusing nonhuman life through the lens of
biopower involves a basic trade-off. [On one hand, the **[extension of
biopower into nonhuman realms raises]{.mark} the spectre of a more
subtle, but nonetheless [corrosive]{.mark}, form of [human power over
the natural]{.mark} world.** On the other hand, because [power]{.mark}
[and resistance]{.mark} are [always co-exist]{.mark}ent,
[nonhumans]{.mark} may [disrupt]{.mark} the functioning of
[environmental governance]{.mark} in new and distinct ways.
Specifically, [biopower faces difficulty]{.mark} in [creating
self-regulating nonhuman subjects]{.mark} who internalise conditions of
subjection.]{.underline} 3.1 Self-regulating subjects and the
justification of power In contrast to absolute power commanded by the
Hobbesian sovereign to ʻtake life or to let liveʼ, Michel Foucault
argues that the modern form of biopower which replaced it in the
nineteenth century was a regulatory and disciplinary form of power that
involved ʻthe administration of bodies and the calculated management of
lifeʼ.36 Biopower organised and administered life, through a variety of
techniques or methods of power that dragged human life itself into the
grid of power-knowledge. Institutions such as universities, public
health agencies and the army, and regulatory forms of knowledge, such as
demography and modern medicine, not only analysed life-processes but
permeated them as well. Yet it was not just the use of these techniques
or the presence of these institutions that characterised
nineteenth-century biopower. Two parallel political shifts made biopower
distinct from sovereign power. The first shift was that the right of the
sovereign to have power over life and death was no longer justified
based on protecting the sovereign from external threat (as in
conscription in cases of war) or internal threat (as in the death
penalty). Rather, the power over life and death was now justified in
terms of the population itself, in modern democratic language. When war
was waged, it was not to protect the sovereign, but in the name of the
people and their continued existence. The justification for biopowerʼs
interventions into the details of life -- reproductive health, the ways
in which we die, normalising vaccinations -- was similarly made in the
name of the population. One effect of this shift, Foucault notes, is
that the death penalty became more difficult to sustain logically: ʻhow
could power exercise its highest prerogatives by putting people to
death, when its main role was to ensure, sustain, and multiply life, to
put this life in order?ʼ37 In other words, the justifications for
powerʼs activities have social effects that exceed the justifications
themselves. What effect, then, will extending ʻprotecting lifeʼ to
ʻprotecting biodiversityʼ have, if we consider the biodiversity census
as an extended example of the logic of biopower? [Part of the answer is
that direct resource exploitation becomes more difficult, since [power
over]{.mark} life/death of [animals, plants, insects or trees can no
longer be justified by needs of the human population]{.mark}/sovereign
to fight natural necessity with all its might.38 [Eco]{.mark}logical
[biopower thus involves]{.mark} both [broader]{.mark} social [trends
like]{.mark} the rise of [modern eco]{.mark}logical
[consciousness]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the emergence of [conservationist
ethics]{.mark} as part of it structural logic.]{.underline} At the same
time, what becomes easier is both the management and regulation of
nonhuman biological life by humans and the direct intervention in, and
mutation of, biological and ecological life-processes, all in the name
of bio- or eco-systemic ʻhealthʼ. [Here, [biopower]{.mark} can be
understood as a logic of eco-governance that simultaneously
[subverts]{.mark} the resource-driven agenda of modern [capital]{.mark}
by trying [to conserve]{.mark} material [nature]{.mark}1 and enables and
rationalises an entirely new form of intervention in life
itself.]{.underline} The ecological sciences, on this reading, are one
of the crucial institutions through which interventions into life are
enacted, and the biodiversity census is one of its primary
power-knowledge techniques. Thinking about biopower as involving
nonhumans also has the consequence of changing the population in whose
name powerʼs exercise is justified. If the idea of biopower adequately
describes the intrusion of scientific, economic and regulatory
techniques into the lives of nonhumans, then administering nonhuman life
must be justified in the name of an expanded population as well -- in
this case, in the name of a global ecological population of species (and
their genes), guided by an ethic of preserving and fostering
biodiversity. In sum, in the name of planetary health (a metaphorical
extension of modern biopowerʼs concern with human public health to a
planetary scale), a new population is configured into which biopower
intervenes, one explicitly composed of human and nonhuman members
participating in ecosystemic communities. The second, parallel shift
that Foucault notes was involved in the move from sovereign to
regulatory power was that there was an unsettling effect on the practice
of governing. [Unlike sovereign power, regulatory [biopower had
the]{.mark} imperative to promote life, to ʻoptimise forces, aptitudes,
and life in generalʼ, and its ʻhighest [function]{.mark} was perhaps no
longer to kill, but [to invest life]{.mark} through and throughʼ.39 Yet,
crucially, it had to do so [in ways that did not make the population
more difficult to govern.]{.mark}]{.underline}40 In other words, however
life was politically managed, it had to be done in ways that ensured
governability. This aspect of biopower was aimed at producing
self-regulating subjects who internalised the qualities that promoted
life but did not fundamentally disrupt social functioning.
Self-regulating subjects were both efficient for power (since subjects
did powerʼs work for it) and governable. [[Yet]{.mark} in this respect,
the movement of [nonhuman entities]{.mark} into the population in whose
name biopower acts [represent]{.mark}s a potential location of
[freedom]{.mark}, or at least resistance, precisely [because]{.mark}
many nonhumans are constitutionally incapable of being self-regulating
subjects who can internalise the conditions of subjection in biopowerʼs
own terms. [Nonhumans do not ʻknowʼ that they are a species]{.mark} or a
member of a specific phylum, in those terms, [or]{.mark} that they have
a [particular gene-sequence]{.mark}; rather, [they]{.mark} [have their
own frameworks]{.mark} of understanding the moments of interaction with
scientists and modes of environmental experience that guide their
actions.]{.underline} In this respect, biotic nonhumans differ from the
human subjects of biopower, who, as Foucaultʼs analysis suggests, become
self-regulating subjects partly in virtue of the way that their
consciousness is structured by biopower -- by its language, its
categories, and the techniques of self-making. When one looks at the
minority of bio-entities that could be made partially self-regulating --
genetically modified crops, pet clones, lab-grown tissue replacement,
gene therapy and pre-selection, regulated game preserves in which
species are fenced in or are trained to learn the boundaries of safe
haven from human predators -- they form a small fraction of the
bio-population. Even in those cases, moreover, there are significant
doubts over whether they can be made into self-regulating subjects in
the same sense as humans. Their ability to accede to and internalise the
normalising effects of power is limited by their biological
constitution. Though they have varying kinds of subjective experience,
they cannot be said to have the self-reflexive kind of subjectivity that
humans do. Whereas human subjectivity is marked by the dual ability to
be a distinct Self in contrast to the environment and to have the
reflexive thought that ʻI am a Selfʼ, nonhumans are generally limited to
the former possibility. If biopower cannot make most nonhumans into
self-regulating subjects, then their governability rests solely on
whether they can be controlled indirectly through the patterned grids of
scientific prediction. Yet as groups and individuals, biological
nonhumans routinely confound predictability, within their own kinds of
subjectivities. They respond to ecological change by unexpectedly
shifting migration patterns and locations. They expand in unanticipated
ways into ecological niches that humans open directly (e.g., suburbs as
feeding grounds for raccoons; rabbits introduced in Australia for
hunting who subsequently overran the countryside; garbage dumps as
sources of food for omnivorous bears) and indirectly (e.g., red-tailed
deer population explosions in New England upon the over-hunting of
deer-predators, causing substantial economic damage and fatal car
accidents). Some species mutate at evolutionary speeds that far exceed
those of humans (e.g., pesticide resistant strains of bugs or
penicillin-resistant viruses). They sometimes form new relations with
other species to the detriment of humans (e.g., birds as carriers of
Asian bird flu). They remake ecosystems into new stabilities and
undermine others. In short, while the lack of subjectivity and
reflexivity in nonhuman populations is usually read as a source of
acquiescence to human interrogation, it seems to also have an opposite
effect, in that it constitutes them as ready sources of resistance and
disruption to the desires of biopower to establish governable
populations. Foucault says of biopower: ʻit is not that life has been
totally integrated into techniques that govern and administer it; it
constantly escapes themʼ.41 Nonhuman agents effect some of the very same
escapes simply by living. Life itself escapes biopower. 3.2. Array of
authorities A second component of biopower is ʻone or more truth
discourses about the "vital" character of living human beings, and an
array of authorities competent to speak that truthʼ.42 In the context of
the nineteenth-century societies that Foucault was analysing, these
truth discourses about living beings included fields like demography and
medicine. In the context of twenty-first-century biopower, Paul Rabinow
and Nikolas Rose suggest that they might be extended to include fields
like genomics, cloning and reproduction.43 What is critical to the truth
discourses surrounding these fields is that there be an array of
authorities, like the human sciences, public health agencies or social
theorists, that both problematise a certain issue and endeavor to
intervene in the field raised by that problematisation. These
authorities both render the issue socially visible and strive to
rationalise solutions. Just as scientists play a central role as
authorities in the truth discourses of human sciences, so too are they
central to the truth discourses of biodiversity loss. The project of the
biodiversity census involves conservation biologists as a critical part
of the authorities competent to create a truth discourse around species
loss and conservation, through the rationalisation of species into an
ordered catalogue of nonhuman life. But the involvement of nonhumans in
this truth discourse exceeds a simple presence as scientific objects,
and raises questions about whether we can think of biopower as
authoritative about nonhumans without any account of how nonhumans might
themselves testify to those truth claims, resist them, or actively
participate to some degree in the making of scientific knowledge. An
alternative account of scientific practice that moves towards such a
distributed model of authority comes from Bruno Latour and others
involved in theorising an actor-network approach, in which human and
nonhuman agents are seen as collaboratively involved in the construction
of scientific truth claims.44 On this account, scientific authority
depends in part on the (nonlinguistic) ʻtestimonyʼ of nonhumans who are
marshalled by scientists to establish the veracity of scientific
accounts.45 While it is still human scientists who problematise the
field of biodiversity loss, then, the array of authorities competent to
ʻspeakʼ the truth discourses surrounding that field is distributed among
both human and nonhuman. This line of argument about authority has three
consequences. First, it speaks to the question of the ʻwhereabouts of
powerʼ. One of the criticisms of Foucaultʼs analytic of power is that
once it is taken past a specific institutional site into the broader
practices of governing, it seems to be everywhere and nowhere.46 In a
broader sense, space and place themselves seem to disappear from power.
In the case of biodiversity sciences, at least, extending the
participants in the biopower formation to nonhumans gives power concrete
locations -- in the places where data is collected, in the laboratories
where representative samples are brought under the microscope, and in
the bodies of species who experience different life-possibilities and
pathways because of the process of classification. What makes
biodiversity discourses potent at all, in other words, is the
marshalling of human and nonhuman authorities to its truth-claims in
particular places and particular biological bodies. Second, the
intrusion of nonhuman life into authority-generating processes like the
biodiversity census disrupts the human subject at the centre of modern
biopower by forcing a new set of constituents into the political field
who cannot quite be captured by it in the same way. Because the biopower
depends on the relative flourishing of life, biopower cannot speak and
act authoritatively on behalf of the health of global biopopulations and
simultaneously extinguish them. The necessity of nonhuman life for
biopower both enables its extension and increases the living things that
disrupt biopowerʼs desire for smooth governing. To return to Foucaultʼs
analysis of the death penalty, if biopower (in contrast with sovereign
power) complicated the state killing its own citizens, then so too
should ecological biopower be seen to complicate the domination of
nonhumans (in modern relations with nature), including the ongoing
anthropogenic species extinction event. Finally, if the Latourian
understanding of authority as distributed between both scientists and
scientific objects is correct, this critique should also apply to
humans, in the human sciences that Foucault was considering. The
authority of scientific claims depends not only on scientists, academics
and public servants, but on the very human subjects that make
authoritative claims possible. Not only is resistance coexistent with
power within human subjectivity, as Foucault claimed,47 but a more
distributed kind of authority also resides in the practices of biopower,
among the subjects who take part in its data collections, experiments
and interventions. 3.3. Biosocial collectivities In Foucaultʼs
historical analysis, the formation of biopower occurs within the context
of the rise of the modern nation-state. Yet the biodiversity crisis,
which I have been thinking of here in terms of an extension of human
biopower into biodiversity-power, presents a political situation in
which there is a veritable state of emergency (species loss), and yet
there is no state in which to declare such a state of emergency. This
observation is true in two senses. It is true, first, in a spatial
sense, in that the biodiversity crisis is global, yet there is no global
state in which such a crisis could effectively be addressed.48 While a
layer of global environmental governance may be growing and even using
environmental problems as a way through which its expansion is made
plausible,49 it does not yet have the logical or practical means to
resolve the wider problems of social justice and development involved in
the biodiversity crisis.50 In a second sense, there is also no political
formation that accepts the participation of nonhumans within its
confines. The nation-state is a modern, secular and thoroughly human
mode of organisation, one that is based around a community of humans who
in turn decide what is right or good for themselves and their
environment. Its reasoning is decidedly and openly anthropocentric, as
ecologists who advance biodiversityʼs cause almost all accept as a
necessary part of communicating the biodiversity crisis to human
publics.51 Similarly, the discourses of global governance draw on a thin
kind of global political community,52 but they do not grasp nonhumans as
participants in their ideological vision. Global governance is hardly
democratic with respect to humans, much less politically inclusive of
nonhumans.53 Understood in this way, when global governance discourses
address biodiversity loss, they do so either as the next logical step in
the postcolonial mission (moving from ʻcivilisation, progress, poverty,
\[to\] environmental sustainabilityʼ),54 or as simply another problem
area for governance to address.55 In the context of biopower that I have
been considering, what then is the effect of global biodiversity census
without a global state? If the modern census was part of a
power-knowledge formation that was both organised by and constitutive of
the nation-state as part of biopower, then a global biodiversity census
should have some transformative effects in constituting political forms.
The hypothesis that I want to suggest is that a biodiversity census will
help construct new ideas of a multi-layered and multi-species global
community. As a way into this hypothesis, consider the effect of the
modern human population census on ideas of community. Benedict Anderson,
for example, argues that the modern census was integrally related to the
creation of the categories necessary for the creation of postcolonial
nation-states. Anderson argues that the ʻ(confusedly) classifying mind
of the colonial stateʼ created identities through the census that might
not have been recognised as such by those who were censused and
classified.56 The census involved a ʻtotalising classificatory grid,
which could be applied with endless flexibility to anything under the
stateʼs real or contemplated controlʼ.57 Yet by undertaking this
project, the conditions of postcolonial nationalism were shaped and
forms of intelligibility were constructed (and imposed) that were not
otherwise there. For present-day aspirants to statehood, a census
remains an important marker of a consolidated national citizenry, as in
the push for a Palestinian census as a way towards achieving a de facto
Palestinian state.58 Similarly, then, a global biodiversity census might
be understood as part of constructing a global biocitizenry and in
forming a global ecopolitical community. Rabinow and Rose suggest that
biopower must include ʻstrategies for intervention in the name of life
or health, initially addressed to populations that may or may not be
territorialised upon the nation, society or pre-given communities, but
may also be specified in terms of emergent bio-social collectivitiesʼ.59
Like Foucault, Rabinow and Rose are concerned with human populations,
but their use of ʻbio-social collectivitiesʼ that are not necessarily
dependent on a territorial population suggests the possibility of forms
of community that are not tied to the nation-state[. If the nation-state
is not necessarily the right analogy for biosocial collectivities of
humans and nonhumans, then Michael [Hardt and]{.mark} Antonio [Negriʼs
expansion of biopower]{.mark} past Foucaultʼs state-bound apparatuses of
governing points towards how a de-territorialised collectivity might be
theorised.60 If Foucaultʼs use of biopower was used in the concrete
historical analysis of the transition in nineteenth-century Europe from
the sovereign state of absolute power over life and death to one ʻin the
name of the peopleʼ of disciplinary and regulatory power, Hardt and
Negri [push]{.mark} the historical [analysis]{.mark} forward [another
step]{.mark} by drawing from Gilles Deleuze the idea of a transition
from a Foucaultian disciplinary society to a society of
control.]{.underline} Disciplinary society exists in relation to
individual subjects, setting the parameters of what is normal and
deviant, prescribing the rules of social behaviour, and constructing the
boundaries of the social space in which its citizens rattle around.
Power in disciplinary society is concentrated in institutions. By
contrast, a society of control moves into the very interior of its
subjects. It regulates not from outside but through its distribution and
internalisation into ʻbrains and bodiesʼ.61 It is a form of power that
exists in networked interiorities (i.e., the linked, self-regulating
consciousness of subjects), not in external impositions, limits,
sanctions or structurings. Power in a society of control is also unique
in the way that it is able to make biopower its exclusive terrain of
reference. For Hardt and Negri, it is also a more totalising form of
power than disciplinary power -- it ʻextends throughout the depths of
the consciousness and bodies of the population -- and at the same time
across the entirety of social relationsʼ.62 It is such an organising
power that Hardt and Negri see as globally operative in the social
production of subjects. But Hardt and Negri are critical of the way in
which the global society of control has been considered in a disembodied
way. They argue that the abstractions of language, communication, and
intellectual ideas have been given productive precedence over the
material and corporeal. 63 [[In their neo-Marxist reading]{.mark}, the
potential of a [biopolitical analysis rests with]{.mark} its study at
[the level of labour, production and bodies. If]{.mark} Marxist
[analysis]{.mark} of modern capitalism [understood **communication as
external**]{.mark} or secondary to the material relations of production,
**[Hardt and Negri]{.mark} want to [read it as internal]{.mark}** and
immanent to production in postmodern capitalism.]{.underline} The
semiotic reconfiguration of postmodern capital that Escobar suggests is
thus the very productive activity in Hardt and Negriʼs framework, and
biopower is a Foucaultian/Marxist hybrid.64 In such a framework,
biodiversity is something produced, and the ʻthingsʼ of biodiversity --
the individuals, the species, the communicative fabric of science around
which knowledge of them is built, the development projects of which
biodiversity is a component -- are implicated in a global society of
control. [Like Foucaultʼs conceptualisation of power, Hardt and Negriʼs
vision of [biopower as a field]{.mark} or fabric [of]{.mark} social and
capitalist [production]{.mark} is an image that [makes us see a total
matrix of power]{.mark}. [Yet]{.mark} their relative [exclusion of
nonhumans is curious]{.mark}, since **[there is a slew of nonhuman
agents outside of that]{.mark} productive [field]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
There is a multitude of nonhumans, so to speak, that includes the
ʻbacterial proletariatʼ, in E.O. Wilsonʼs colourful metaphor and the
nomadic animal populations who routinely exceed national borders.

### Alt Fails

titled, as it happens, \'\'Empire\'\' \-- that the globe was ruled by a
new imperial order, different from earlier ones, which were based on
overt military domination. This one had no center; it was managed by the
world\'s wealthy nation-states (particularly the United States), by
multinational corporations and by international institutions like the
World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund. This
empire \-- a k a globalization \-- was exploitative, undemocratic and
repressive, not only for developing countries but also for the excluded
in the rich West. [Hardt and Negri\'s new book, [\'\'Multitude,\'\'
argues]{.mark} that [the antidote to empire is the realization of true
democracy]{.mark}, \'\'the rule of everyone by everyone, a democracy
without qualifiers.\'\' They say that the left needs to [leave behind
outdated concepts like the proletariat and]{.mark} the [working class,
which]{.mark} vastly [oversimplify]{.mark} the gender/racial/ethnic/
class diversities of [today\'s world]{.mark}. [In their place they
propose the]{.mark} term [\'\'multitude]{.mark},\'\' to capture the
\'\'commonality and singularity\'\' of those who stand in opposition to
the wealthy and powerful. [This book]{.mark} \-- which lurches from
analyses of intellectual property rules for genetically engineered
animals to discourses on Dostoyevsky and the myth of the golem \-- deals
with an imaginary problem and a real problem. Unfortunately, it
[provides]{.mark} us with [an **imaginary solution to the real
problem**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The imaginary problem stems from the
authors\' basic understanding of economics and politics, which remains
at its core unreconstructedly Marxist. [[For them, there is no such
thing as voluntary economic exchange]{.mark}, only coercive political
hierarchy]{.underline}: any unequal division of rewards is prima facie
evidence of exploitation. Private property is a form of theft.
[[Globalization has no]{.mark} redeeming [benefits]{.mark} whatsoever.
(East [Asia\'s rise]{.mark} from third- to first-world status in the
last 50 years [seems not to have registered]{.mark} on their mental
map.) Similarly, [democracy is not]{.mark} embodied in constitutions,
political parties or [elections]{.mark}, which are simply manipulated to
benefit elites. The [half of the country that votes Republican is
evidently not part of the]{.mark} book\'s
[multitude]{.mark}.]{.underline} To all this Hardt and Negri add an
extremely confused theory, their take on what Daniel Bell labeled
postindustrial society, and what has more recently been called the
\'\'knowledge economy.\'\' The \'\'immaterial labor\'\' of knowledge
workers differs from labor in the industrial era, Hardt and Negri say,
because it produces not objects but social relations. It is inherently
communal, which implies that no one can legitimately appropriate it for
private gain. Programmers at Microsoft may be surprised to discover that
because they collaborate with one another, their programs belong to
everybody. It\'s hard to know even how to engage this set of assertions.
[**[Globalization is]{.mark} a [complex]{.mark} phenomenon**; it
produces winners and losers among rich and poor alike.]{.underline} But
you would never learn about the complexities from reading
\'\'Multitude.\'\' So let\'s move on to Hardt and Negri\'s real problem,
which has to do with global governance. We have at this point in human
history evolved fairly good democratic political institutions, but only
at the level of the nation-state. With globalization \-- and increased
flows of information, goods, money and people across borders \--
countries are now better able to help, but also to harm, one another. In
the 1990\'s, the harm was felt primarily through financial shocks and
job losses, and since 9/11 it has acquired a military dimension as well.
As the authors state, \'\'one result of the current form of
globalization is that certain national leaders, both elected and
unelected, gain greater powers over populations outside their own
nation-states.\'\' The United States is uniquely implicated in this
charge because of its enormous military, economic and cultural power.
What drove people around the world crazy about the Bush
administration\'s unilateral approach to the Iraq war was its assertion
that it was accountable to no one but American voters for what it did in
distant parts of the globe. And since institutions like the United
Nations are woefully ill equipped to deal with democratic legitimacy,
this democracy deficit is a real and abiding challenge at the
international level. [[The authors]{.mark} are conscious of the charge
that they, like the Seattle anti-globalization protesters they
celebrate, **[don\'t have]{.mark} any real [solutions]{.mark}** to these
matters, so they spend some time discussing how to fix the present
international institutions. Their problem is that any [fixes are]{.mark}
politically difficult if not [impossible]{.mark} to bring about,
[and]{.mark} promise [only marginal benefits]{.mark}. Democratic
institutions that work at the nation-state level don\'t work at global
levels. A true [global democracy]{.mark}, in which all of the earth\'s
billions of people actually vote, [is]{.mark} **an [impossible]{.mark}
dream**, while existing proposals to modify the United Nations Security
Council or change the balance of power between it and the General
Assembly are political nonstarters.]{.underline} Making the World Bank
and I.M.F. more transparent are worthy projects, but hardly solutions to
the underlying issue of democratic accountability. The United States,
meanwhile, has stood in the way of new institutions like the
International Criminal Court. It is at this point that Hardt and Negri
take leave of reality \-- arriving at an imaginary solution to their
real problem. They argue that instead of \'\'repeating old rituals and
tired solutions\'\' we need to begin \'\'a new investigation in order to
formulate a new science of society and politics.\'\' The woolliness of
the subsequent analysis is hard to overstate. According to them, the
fundamental obstacle to true democracy is not just the monopoly of
legitimate force held by nation-states, but the dominance implied in
virtually all hierarchies, which give certain individuals authority over
others. The authors dress up Marx\'s old utopia of the withering away of
the state in the contemporary language of chaos theory and biological
systems, suggesting that hierarchies should be replaced with networks
that reflect the diversity and commonality of the \'\'multitude.\'\' The
difficulty with this line of reasoning is that there is a whole class of
issues networks can\'t resolve. This is why hierarchies, from
nation-states to corporations to university departments, persist, and
why so many left-wing movements claiming to speak on behalf of the
people have ended up monopolizing power. [Indeed, the **[powerlessness
and poverty in today\'s world are due not to]{.mark} the excessive
[power of nation-states, but to their weakness.]{.mark}** [The solution
is not to undermine sovereignty but]{.mark} to **[build stronger
states]{.mark}** in the developing world.]{.underline} To illustrate,
take the very different growth trajectories of East Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa over the past generation. Two of the fastest growing economies in
the world today happen to be in the two most populous countries, China
and India; sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, has tragically seen
declining per capita incomes over the same period. At least part of this
difference is the result of globalization: China and India have
integrated themselves into the global economy, while sub-Saharan Africa
is the one part of the world barely touched by globalization or
multinational corporations. But this raises the question of why India
and China have been able to take advantage of globalization, while
Africa has not. The answer has largely to do with the fact that the
former have strong, well-developed state institutions providing basic
stability and public goods. They had only to get out of the way of
private markets to trigger growth. By contrast, modern states were
virtually unknown in most of sub-Saharan Africa before European
colonialism, and the weakness of states in the region has been the
source of its woes ever since. [[Any project]{.mark}, then, [to
fix]{.mark} the ills of [\'\'empire\'\' has to begin with]{.mark} the
[strengthening]{.mark}, not the dismantling, [of institutions at the
nation-state level.]{.mark} This will not solve the problems of global
governance, but surely any real advance here will come only through
slow, patient innovation and the reform of international institutions.
Hardt and Negri should remember the old insight of the Italian Marxist
Antonio Gramsci, taken up later by the German Greens: [progress is to be
achieved not with utopian dreaming, but with a \'\'long march through
institutions.\'\']{.mark}]{.underline}

[While U.S. hegemony entails perplexities and burdens, an [abandonment
of hegemony may carry]{.mark} risks. Diminished U.S. leadership [could
prove dangerously disruptive of the international system and
imperil]{.mark} the well-being of [people]{.mark}s [everywhere]{.mark},
Americans included. A U.S. retreat [could undermine]{.mark} an
[international economy]{.mark} that has generated impressive global
abundance and peace beneficial to many.]{.underline} Simply consider the
resources now available today (an annual worldwide output of \$30
trillion at the end of the twentieth century) compared to fifty years
earlier when it was a tenth that figure. Imagine what this amazing,
unprecedented leap in global productivity has meant to health and
welfare in all lands. Without U.S. leadership, so the defenders of
hegemony claim, these gains might well have been limited, even
nonexistent. [A future of diminished abundance might prove distinctly
unpleasant: [greater discord among states and peoples leading to rising
cultural intolerance]{.mark}, flaring [nationalist fervor]{.mark} and
rivalry, deepening [international divisions]{.mark}, and [fraying
economic ties]{.mark} that would slow growth and press down longevity
and health in wide swaths of the human population.]{.underline} This
would be a world of narrower horizons, fewer choices, and less
interaction among peoples and cultures. [It would also be a world with
[diminish]{.mark}ed [capacity for addressing]{.mark} mounting [global
problems]{.mark}. [Advocates for maintaining U.S. dominance]{.mark}
along current neoliberal lines [hold the ideological high
ground.]{.mark}]{.underline} The predominant version of American
nationalism took a distinctly activist turn in the course of the
twentieth century. From the 1890s to the 1920s the notion of the United
States as a dynamic republic with the vision and energy to manage the
world's affairs began to come into its own. Republicans dedicated to an
assertive policy along a broad front contributed to this shift in
thinking. So too did Woodrow Wilson with his fervent support for the
ideal of a progressive international society. In 1941 Henry Luce blended
this set of nationalist ideas in his vision of an American century
marked by the advance of political freedom, unhampered commerce, and
general economic abundance. The most activist U.S. leaders after World
War II drew from this creed, as appealing to visionary Wilsonians such
as Harry Truman as to corporate-minded Republicans such as Ronald Reagan
and the younger Bush. [Over the past half century [it has become an
orthodoxy so potent]{.mark} in its appeal [that challengers risk
exile]{.mark} from membership in the foreign policy establishment [and
exclusion]{.mark} from government posts.]{.underline} Such is the
allegiance commanded by the one true faith. Or as John Adams observed
pungently, "Power always thinks it has a great Soul, and vast Views."¹⁰
Even so, a good case can be made for a U.S. retreat from hegemony and
toward a more modest and sustainable role in the world. A searching
critique has no reason to linger on matters of style, particularly such
easy targets as a policy governed by restless unilateralism or
simplistic assumptions. [Such a [critique should]{.mark} instead [turn
to the hegemonic project itself]{.mark}. The place to begin a critical
evaluation is with the tendency of the [champions of heg]{.mark}emony to
[oversell the product]{.mark}. They point to its historical achievements
to the neglect of the costs it has imposed on others. The leaders of
[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [have managed heg]{.mark}emony with
a lamentably heavy hand---[with scant respect for]{.mark} human [life
and]{.mark} scant respect for human [diversity]{.mark}. [Millions
died]{.mark} and many societies suffered profound disruption as a result
of the U.S. interventions that dot the pages of this
account.]{.underline} To those costs would have to be added an
intolerance of views on markets and the state that diverge from U.S.
preferences. As a result, U.S. pressure has in some cases blocked or
disrupted socioeconomic and political experiments favored by others,
especially in Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. [In other
cases, an insistence on an American way has generated tensions with
major states such as China or regions such as western Europe with
divergent interests and values; [that insistence has]{.mark} also
[strained ties with]{.mark} genuinely international organizations such
as [the UN]{.mark}. On virtually every front [U.S. leaders]{.mark} have
left themselves open to charges of hypocrisy---of ignoring if not
[violat]{.mark}ing the ideals of [democracy and
self-determination]{.mark} that they publicly profess.]{.underline} A
look into the future reveals more grounds for doubts about the hegemonic
project. [Put simply, [the time for U.S. heg]{.mark}emony [may have
passed]{.mark}. As the relative U.S. advantage in economic might and
cultural appeal slips, attempts to exercise hegemony may prove
increasingly counterproductive, doing more to further undermine than to
confirm U.S. dominance. The U.S. economy labors under limits. Persistent
structural [problems include oil dependency, low domestic
savings]{.mark}, and [deep trade and]{.mark} federal [budget
deficits]{.mark}.]{.underline} The core U.S. cultural model---a faith in
unending corporate-driven growth and the unending delights of
consumerism---may be fading at least in the developed world. Western
Europe and Japan have both drawn alongside the United States in their
technological capacity, their income levels, their capital resources,
and the depth and integration of their home markets. They need no longer
look to the United States as a model in any of these areas. The consumer
revolution led by Americans may have at least in these two regions run
its course. Rising per capita income beyond a point (in the range of
\$15,000 in a fair sampling of countries recently surveyed) seems to
produce no greater individual satisfaction while imposing costs captured
not by conventional GDP data but by social GDP estimates.¹¹ In military
affairs, the United States has retained, even increased, its dominance.
But to what end? Its massive nuclear stockpile can be used only at the
risk of profound and widespread moral revulsion and in some
circumstances of devastating counterstrikes. Its high-tech forces may be
the wonder of the world. But they are effective only against the most
peripheral and isolated of states (in what one observer has dismissed as
"theatrical micromilitarism"), and they have limited capacity to rebuild
what they have destroyed.¹² The exercise of military might has proven a
poor substitute for the intricacies of diplomatic negotiation, the
trade-offs indispensable to international comity, and the long-term
commitment of resources to economic development and human welfare.
Finally, hegemony may hurt the hegemon. Evidence can be found in the
privileging of corporate interests harmful to popular welfare, a
fixation with military power that amounts to a national obsession, an
increasingly infantilized and inert public, and the rise of an imperial
presidency antithetical to genuine democracy. These trends validate a
sharply critical view of foreign adventures that prevailed during the
country's first century. Proponents of republicanism claimed that
crusades, even crusades conducted in the name of freedom, threatened
freedom at home. [The history of republican experiments across history
showed that [foreign entanglements]{.mark} and adventures created
dangerous concentrations of political power within and
[undermined]{.mark} the very [civic virtues on which the survival of any
republic depended]{.mark}.]{.underline} Vindicating this republican fear
is the rise of the imperial president and the concomitant atrophy of the
democratic process. While most Americans today may not see hegemony
through this anxious republican lens, many have voiced their discontent
with the outward thrust of U.S. policy. Some express it in frustration
and chagrin directed not against U.S. leaders but against a seemingly
ungrateful, unyielding, dangerous world and call for scaling back
international commitments. The most restive have contended that a more
isolated, less burdened America would be better off--- less vulnerable
to attack, less dependent on fickle friends, less likely to get
entangled in distant quarrels, and more secure in its homeland and its
domestic liberties. Others refuse to go this far and instead put the
blame squarely on U.S. leaders---political and corporate---whose
free-market, environmental, and human rights policies have betrayed
values as important at home as in the international community. Taken
together, these critical reactions suggest a broad-based skepticism
about hegemony. But the critics may be so fundamentally divided
philosophically, politically, regionally, and socially that they cannot
cobble together a common program to serve as an alternative to hegemony.
A retreat from hegemony need not lead to isolationism. This myth about
the nature of U.S. foreign relations in the past, which was constructed
in the first place for the very purpose of justifying U.S. dominance, is
likely to figure prominently in any defense of the status quo. But the
notion of isolation is flawed as history and as a source of lessons.
Today as earlier, the United States has a major stake in a productive,
peaceful, and just global society. [By extension, [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has an obligation]{.mark} rooted in self-interest if
not calculations of altruism and long-term human welfare [to]{.mark}
help [mobilize]{.mark} a collective [international response to]{.mark}
the [problems]{.mark} generated by that society.]{.underline} A retreat
implies that the United States would act in world affairs not as the
leader but as a leader, perhaps in some circumstances the first among
equals. Engaging in a genuinely collaborative relationship with other
states and taking international institutions and norms seriously may
hold out the best hope of extending the considerable achievements of the
previous fifty years and in the bargain maintaining U.S. influence and
advancing U.S. well-being. The historical case for the efficacy of
collaboration is compelling. The U.S. role after World War I calmed, for
a time at least, the arms race, gave the Europeans a chance to sort out
their monetary tangle, and sustained the turn-of-the-century drive to
create humane standards of international conduct. The post--World War II
record is even more striking. The achievements in setting norms (such as
outlawing genocide), rehabilitating defeated Germany and Japan, and
creating a framework for global prosperity were the result of
collaboration richly repaid in international support and respect, not to
mention enhanced U.S. security. This collaborative element helped not
only to distinguish the U.S. from the Soviet side during the Cold War,
but also to determine the outcome of a competition that was as much
about systems and values as military might. International cooperation is
not an illusion; it yields results far better than a course defined by
narrow self-interest and pursued by brute force. Whatever the
attractions of a more modest, collaborative internationalism, winning
broad acceptance of such an approach faces serious difficulties. It
requires that Americans think about their role in the world in a fresh,
genuinely global way quite distinct from the cautious opportunism
familiar from the first U.S. century and the rising assertiveness that
has marked recent decades. It also requires a sensitivity to the
intricacies of the global system and the cultural diversity of its
parts. That sensitivity will not come easily to today's body politic,
which features a disengaged, ill-schooled public and a political class
beholden to interest groups and trapped by shallow rhetoric and narrow,
short-term calculations. Above all, the middle way offers nothing heroic
to a country of individualists that may be dependent on civic
nationalism as one of the few sources of collective identity. Indeed,
calls for serious, long-term support for economic development programs,
genuine respect for international norms, and tolerance for regional
diversity collide with prevailing nationalist and neoliberal notions,
which continue to inspire bold dreams of global transformation under the
American aegis and in the American image. [A [retreat from hegemony
would require a lot]{.mark}: a more cosmopolitan understanding of other
cultures, a more sophisticated grasp of U.S. limits, a genuinely
democratic electoral system responsive to popular preferences, and a
better informed electorate able to think through those
preferences.]{.underline} The fate of the current ascendancy with its
hegemonic dimensions may well hang on how Americans measure up to these
high standards and how rapidly structural problems eat away at the
foundations of our hegemony. What the next page of the national story
has to say may depend on how well we take into account the possibilities
and constraints created by a history of burgeoning state power, strong
nationalism, and intrusive global forces.
