### Uniqueness\-\--Will Pass

#### BBB can pass by the end of July. Dems are hopeful and are moving quickly because of looming midterms, but PC is key to resolve remaining issues.

latest attempt at resurrecting Build Back Better, explained," Vox. July

This month, [Democrats are, once again, trying to resurrect parts of the
Build Back Better Act after the broader package imploded last
year.]{.underline}

[To do so, the party is focusing on provisions aimed at lowering
prescription drug costs, **something that has the full support of all 50
Senate Democrats**. Negotiations on more contentious climate and tax
policies, meanwhile, are ongoing.]{.underline}

On Wednesday, [following an agreement between Senate Majority Leader
Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) --- one of the key
holdouts on the original BBB package --- lawmakers officially submitted
the prescription drugs plan to the Senate parliamentarian for
review.]{.underline} The parliamentarian, a nonpartisan procedural
expert, will determine if the proposal can qualify for the budget
reconciliation process, which enables policies that affect the budget to
pass with 51 votes in the Senate, rather than the 60 needed if a bill is
filibustered under normal rules.

[Schumer and Manchin are still in talks about additional climate and tax
provisions that could be included in the legislation]{.underline}, but
it's uncertain whether those will make it into a final bill. It also
isn't clear where Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), who once opposed certain
corporate tax hikes in the original BBB bill, stands on those two
issues. [(Previously, Sinema appeared satisfied with some of the updated
BBB tax policies that had been negotiated last year.)]{.underline}

[Although there are still outstanding subjects to work on, **Democrats
are hopeful** that movement on prescription drugs will both allow the
party to achieve a longtime goal, and to signal to midterms voters that
Democratic lawmakers can make progress on something.]{.underline}

[The prescription drugs proposal --- though much narrower than its
previous iteration --- **is significant:** It would enable Medicare to
negotiate prices on a select group of drugs beginning in 2023 and cap
Medicare patients' out-of-pocket drug costs at \$2,000 a
year]{.underline}. But if it is all Democrats are able to pass, the
party will have fallen far short of what it had initially strived to
achieve with the Build Back Better Act, which included substantial
funding for green energy tax credits and social programs as well.

What Democrats have agreed on so far

Thus far, Democrats are aligned on their prescription drugs plan and not
much else. The plan aims to make some drugs more affordable, though it
drops some original BBB proposals, like a \$35 monthly cap on insulin
costs.

As [Manchin had previously said, his goal is for the legislation to be a
deficit-reduction bill, with about 50 percent of the revenue it's
bringing in going to paying down the deficit, and the other half going
to cover new spending]{.underline}. A major chunk of new revenue is
likely to come from the prescription drug policies, since they could
include billions in savings for Medicare. [Here are the prescription
drug provisions that Democrats agree on so far:]{.underline}

[Allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices:]{.underline} Medicare has
historically been barred from negotiating on most prescription drug
prices, meaning it pays drug prices set by the market. This bill would
change that. In doing so, it could mean drastic price reductions on
specific drugs for people covered by Medicare, since the government has
huge buying and negotiating power.

The savings would not apply to people covered by private insurance,
however, Reuters reports. The legislation guarantees that Medicare can
begin negotiations in 2023, starting with 10 drugs, which will be chosen
by the Department of Health and Human Services.

[Capping out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare recipients]{.underline}:
The legislation would cap annual out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare
recipients at \$2,000. After that, Medicare would pay for additional
expenses. It would be a major change since there is currently no cap,
meaning people can spend thousands more for a single drug.

[Requiring rebates for price hikes]{.underline}: If pharmaceutical
companies raise the costs of a drug at a rate faster than the rate of
inflation, they would be forced to refund the difference to people
paying for the drug.

[Expanding prescription drug subsidies for low-income
seniors:]{.underline} Currently, seniors who are at or below 150 percent
of the federal poverty line are able to receive a partial subsidy for
their prescription drugs. The legislation would enable them to receive a
larger subsidy for these expenses.

[Making vaccines free for seniors]{.underline}: The legislation would
make all vaccines free for seniors, a notable change in coverage.
Currently, Medicare covers some vaccines, like the flu shot, but not all
immunizations are included.

[Democrats are trying to do what they can before the
midterms]{.underline}

Although Democrats' electoral chances in the Senate are looking better
than they are in the House, it's possible the party loses control of one
or both chambers of Congress following the November midterms. [With the
elections fast approaching, **Democrats are scrambling to capitalize on
their existing majorities** in case they are no longer able to pass
legislation next year.]{.underline}

[This reconciliation bill could be the party's last major chance to
approve new prescription drugs, climate, and tax policy --- all of which
would be far less likely to advance if Republicans retake just one
chamber of Congress. If they are able to make quick progress in the
coming weeks, it's possible that **Democrats could hold a vote on the
reconciliation bill as soon as the end of July.**]{.underline}

Republicans are aggressively pushing back on these efforts: Senate
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has threatened to pull support on a
bipartisan bill aimed at investing in the US's supply chain unless
Democrats abandon reconciliation. [Democrats have responded by claiming
McConnell is trying to deter the reconciliation bill in order to protect
pharmaceutical companies.]{.underline}

[To successfully push through a reconciliation bill, however, Senate
Democrats need all 50 members of their caucus on board with the
legislation]{.underline}, as well as approval from the parliamentarian
--- who can advise against including provisions if they aren't seen as
sufficiently related to taxing and spending. House Democrats, many of
whom have pushed for a more ambitious bill in the past, would need to
vote in favor as well. Recent comments from [House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
suggest that some lawmakers would be open to a smaller bill if it meant
getting part of the package done.]{.underline}

[For now, the submission of the prescription drugs proposal **indicates
that Democrats are at least trying to pass a bill**]{.underline}, even
if there's no guarantee that other, more expansive provisions will be
included.

#### A slimmed-down bill passes. Manchin and Schumer are on board and are negotiating in good faith, progressives agree, and the bill solves climate.

[President Joe Biden's economic agenda might be back from the
dead]{.underline}. If the original proposal was Build Back Better, this
is more like Build Back a Bit.

[Democrats this week took the **first formal step toward reviving** a
stripped-down version of the nearly \$2 trillion plan that Senator Joe
Manchin killed late last year]{.underline}. Majority Leader Chuck
[Schumer asked the Senate parliamentarian to review a proposed agreement
that aims to reduce the cost of prescription drugs by allowing Medicare
to negotiate prices directly---a long-sought Democratic priority that
Manchin supports.]{.underline} [That is one major component of a deal
**Schumer and Manchin have been discussing** that would include
**hundreds of billions of dollars to combat climate change** along with
deficit-slashing tax increases on the wealthy.]{.underline}

**[The deal could be ready for votes on the Senate floor by the end of
this month]{.underline}**, [according to a Democrat familiar with the
talks who described the development as "major progress" toward enacting
a chunk of Biden's program before the midterm elections]{.underline}.
Caveats abound: Schumer and Manchin have yet to complete either the tax
or the climate portions of the bill, and the West Virginia centrist has
abandoned negotiations before. With no Republican support, Democrats
need the parliamentarian to determine whether their proposal can qualify
for the process known as budget reconciliation, which would circumvent
an expected filibuster and allow a bill to pass with a simple majority
vote. A second Democratic aide, who like the first spoke anonymously to
describe the delicate discussions, told me that a final deal would
"probably take several weeks" and characterized the hopes for a vote
before Congress breaks for its August recess as "ambitious."

Yet [the fact that the Schumer-Manchin talks have advanced even this far
counts as a welcome surprise for Democrats, especially considering how
acrimoniously the original Build Back Better negotiations collapsed in
December.]{.underline} Manchin walked away after accusing the White
House of putting his family at risk by singling him out in an otherwise
anodyne statement describing the status of the discussions. In
announcing his decision on Fox News, he further complained that the
Democrats' proposal was full of budget gimmicks and could worsen
inflation. Because Manchin represented the crucial 50th vote in the
evenly divided Senate, his departure ended Biden's hopes of delivering
on a progressive agenda that initially included a federal paid-leave
program, universal pre-kindergarten, free community college, and an
extension of the president's expanded child tax credit.

The negotiations remained dormant through the winter. "There is no Build
Back Better bill," Manchin told reporters in February. "It's dead." But
[he and Schumer quietly began talking again in the spring, keeping their
negotiations secret both to avoid the daily pestering of the Capitol
Hill press corps and to prevent Democrats from getting their hopes
up.]{.underline} Gone are many of the items on Biden's original wish
list, as is the original \$3.5 trillion price tag. [The total revenue
Schumer and Manchin now hope to generate through tax increases and
drug-pricing reform is likely to be in the area of \$1 trillion, with
about \$500 billion in new spending on climate and energy
policies.]{.underline}

**[Any deal that Schumer and Manchin strike will probably win applause
from the bulk of the Democratic Party, including
progressives]{.underline}**. [A \$1 trillion bill]{.underline} might
seem paltry next to the dream of \$3.5 trillion, but [it's a lot better
than the nothing that most Democrats have expected to get for the past
six months. "The contours are fine," Adam Green, a co-founder of the
Progressive Change Campaign Committee, told me about the potential
deal]{.underline}. He said [the climate piece was "by far" the most
important aspect of the package for progressives, especially in light of
last month's Supreme Court decision limiting the EPA's ability to fight
climate change. "We can't reverse the Trump tax cuts if the planet
disintegrates. **The other two \[proposals\] are political
winners,"**]{.underline} Green said of the drug-pricing reforms and tax
increases. "Climate change is just existential for the planet, and this
might be our last chance."

[Another sign that the negotiations are serious is that Senate Minority
Leader Mitch McConnell tried to torpedo them last week by threatening to
pull GOP support from a bipartisan high-tech manufacturing bill if the
Democrats moved forward with the one-party reconciliation progress.
Schumer's move today suggests that at least for now, **McConnell's
warning hasn't scared off Manchin.**]{.underline}

[Democrats are **taking tangible steps** towards a **deal on their
party's signature spending bill, expecting the proposal to dominate the
rest of July** and hoping it could reshape their political fortunes
after six months of stasis.]{.underline}

[Talks between Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Joe Manchin
(D-W.Va.) are beginning to **yield concrete results** on a potential
climate, tax and prescription drugs package. Schumer told Senate
Democrats recently that if he can reach a deal with Manchin, **the bill
could be on the floor as soon as this month,** according to a person
familiar with the negotiations.]{.underline}

[Negotiators are still ironing out key details, but Democrats are
signaling that as soon as next week they will begin arguing their case
to the Senate rules chief on why the package should pass with a simple
majority in the chamber.]{.underline} No one is getting their hopes too
high in a party still reeling from Manchin's rejection of Build Back
Better, Democrats' previous version of the legislation.

Democrats interviewed for this story ranged from near-certain there will
be a deal to fretful that anything will ever materialize.

[**"I am generally optimistic**. I'll believe it when there's a
deal,"]{.underline} said Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) on Thursday. ["I
believe there is positive momentum, I believe there have been
constructive conversations. But the specifics, the details, I think it's
best to let that work itself out."]{.underline}

[Democrats solved the easiest piece of their puzzle this week:
finalizing a prescription drug pricing reform deal from last year, which
both lowers prices and is expected to raise at least \$250 billion in
revenues.]{.underline} Democrats submitted that piece to the Senate
parliamentarian for review, trying to ensure it doesn't run afoul of the
strict chamber rules that govern whether legislation can pass with a
simple majority, known as budget reconciliation.

And [they plan to soon submit an additional piece on a deal that extends
Medicare solvency. **Both those pieces are expected to have the support
of all 50 Senate Democrats.**]{.underline}

[Shaving down the \$555 billion energy package from the abandoned Build
Back Better bill is proving tougher;]{.underline} Manchin is looking at
energy spending of around \$300 billion and ultimately new subsidies for
electric vehicles could be cut, according to a second person familiar
with the negotiations. Democrats are also trying to prevent health care
premiums from skyrocketing this fall, and they need to detail tax
increases and enforcement that would both pay for the bill and reduce
the deficit, priorities of Manchin's.

Roughly speaking, [Manchin and Schumer are working toward legislation
that provides \$1 trillion in new revenues, half of which would go
toward deficit reduction and half of which would go toward energy and
health spending.]{.underline} Such a deal is hypothetical at the moment:
The tax and energy pieces remain in major flux.

"[Senator Manchin]{.underline} has repeatedly expressed his concerns
about rising inflation, a pending recession and the state of American
energy security. He [**continues to work in good faith** to see if there
is a pathway forward to shore up domestic energy production and reduce
emissions, lower health care costs for seniors and working families, and
ensure everyone is paying their fair share of taxes," said Sam Runyon, a
spokeswoman for Manchin.]{.underline}

[Schumer]{.underline} declined to comment on negotiations but [said
recently that he and Manchin are "continuing to have very good and
productive discussions." Both men are keeping their talks close to the
vest given their up-and-down history: Manchin and Schumer entered into a
secret reconciliation agreement last July, Manchin rejected President
Joe Biden's Build Back Better bill in December and Manchin blanched at
both Biden and Schumer's attempts to weaken the legislative filibuster
this year.]{.underline}

As I wrote last year, [the political advantage of Biden's economic
agenda was always its size and ambition, because that meant with slim
margins in Congress, it could withstand plenty of cuts and still
represent a significant legislative accomplishment. That remains true
today, perhaps even more so. An agreement on drug pricing, climate
spending, and tax increases, combined with Biden's \$1.9 trillion
American Rescue Plan, the \$1 trillion infrastructure law, and the
recent bipartisan gun-safety compromise, would make the president's
legislative record look a lot more robust.]{.underline}

Politically, [a scaled-down bill that passes close to the midterm
elections, when it will be fresh in voters' minds, might be just as
beneficial to Democrats as a larger bill enacted months
earlier.]{.underline} **[Each of the major components has clear
constituencies]{.underline}**. [Lowering the cost of prescription drugs
is a particular hit with seniors, a key voting bloc, and Democrats also
plan to sell the change as a way to offset the impact of inflation.
Combatting climate change is a priority of progressive and younger
voters, whom Democrats need to turn out in November. And polls have long
shown that tax increases on the wealthy are among the most broadly
popular proposals in Biden's plan.]{.underline}

### [Internal\-\--Climate]{.underline}

#### BBB passes and is the last chance to meet climate goals. It's valuable even if they win we can't solve [all]{.underline} of climate.

[The latest Supreme Court case made it harder for the EPA to regulate
climate pollution from power plants]{.underline}, which could
drastically limit the country's ability to hit its climate goals. [But
there's more that the government can do now to push for reduced
emission, including passing new climate legislation---and **there's a
chance**]{.underline}, albeit an uncertain one, [that Congress might be
close to finally doing that.]{.underline}

["I think that \[the Supreme Court\] decision was yet another shot in
the arm to Congress that they must legislate on climate
action,"]{.underline} says Melinda Pierce, legislative director for the
Sierra Club, **[who is optimistic that a climate deal could happen this
month]{.underline}**. Last year, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin
helped killed the Build Back Better Act, Biden's plan that included more
than \$550 billion to fight climate change with clean energy tax
credits, grants and loans for clean energy and zero-emissions vehicles,
rebates for home-energy efficiency and electrification, and other
measures. But [Manchin has reportedly been meeting regularly with Senate
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to negotiate climate policy that he could
support.]{.underline}

Last week, [Democrats finalized a proposal to lower the price of
prescription drugs for seniors, a key pillar that Manchin wants as part
of the negotiations for a broad bill of various reforms Democrats could
pass during reconciliation]{.underline}, **[which allows them to avoid
needing 60 votes for a filibuster]{.underline}**. And though nothing is
certain---the discussions between Manchin and Schumer are happening
behind closed doors, and Congress has failed to pass climate policy
multiple times in the past---**[an announcement might come soon on
climate legislation]{.underline}**, [**which could be passed** as part
of the reconciliation package **before the end of
September.**]{.underline} (In reality, a deal would need to happen this
month, before the Senate takes its August vacation.) "[**It's their last
best chance** to see if the Democrats can come to some deal to
demonstrate they can legislate,"]{.underline} Pierce says. Depending on
what happens in the midterm elections, **[there may not be another
chance to pass strong climate policy soon enough to avoid the worst
outcomes of climate change.]{.underline}**

A study earlier this year found that **[it's still possible to cut U.S.
greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030]{.underline}**; that's the goal
of the Biden administration, [and in line with what climate science says
is necessary globally. Since most of the country's emissions come from
the power and transportation sectors, moving to clean energy that can
also support electric cars is critical. The primary barrier isn't cost,
the study said, but enacting policy.]{.underline} The shift is already
happening, but it's happening too slowly and will need additional pushes
from the government, in terms of both regulations and incentives, to get
up to speed. Part of that can come from the executive branch, since the
EPA can still regulate pollution from vehicles and has other options to
cut pollution at individual power plants. Several states and many cities
also have plans to reach 100% clean energy. But **[support from Congress
is still also necessary]{.underline}**.

[Clean energy tax credits, which are likely to be the biggest part of
the proposal under discussion, are "**absolutely critical to meeting
those 2030 goals** that we've set for ourselves," says Ben Pendergrass,
senior director of government affairs for Citizens' Climate Lobby, a
nonpartisan climate advocacy group. "They don't get us all the way
there. But we know we have a definite timeline that we have to meet. And
so, even if it didn't get all the way there, we need to lock in wins
while we can."]{.underline}

["The chatter on the Hill is very hopeful. The bill could be **very

communities,"]{.underline} John Reuter, the League of Conservation
Voters' vice president for state and local strategies, told Route Fifty
in an interview.

Since the House version of the plan was blocked in the Senate by
moderate West Virginia Democratic Sen. [Joe Manchin last year, he and
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York have been negotiating
behind the scenes on a new, smaller proposal.]{.underline}

On Wednesday, [Schumer sent an agreement the two have reached on an
aspect of a broader deal, a proposal to lower drug prices, to the
Senate's parliamentarian.]{.underline}

[That procedural move]{.underline}, to see if the drug pricing deal
complies with Senate rules that would allow it to be passed without any
Republican votes, [has raised hopes that Schumer and Manchin are close
to agreement on other aspects of a deal, including the climate
provisions.]{.underline}

If so, [Democrats could try to pass the overall package under a partisan
budget procedure called reconciliation **before Congress leaves for its
August recess.**]{.underline}

**[The funding would be a boon for states]{.underline}**, [particularly
as even some headed by Republican governors try to combat climate
change.]{.underline}

Last November, a bipartisan group of 24 governors, called the U.S.
Climate Alliance, committed to trying to reach a number of ambitious
goals, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions by half in their
states by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions no later than 2050.

It's unknown how much of the proposal passed by the House last November
will survive the Senate negotiations. That bill included \$555 billion
in climate funding, a plan the Biden administration touted as "the
largest effort to combat the climate crisis in American history."

Among other things, [the House bill called for creating \$250 million in
grants to help states, local governments and tribes develop plans to
reduce greenhouse gas air pollution, and an additional \$4.75 billion to
actually implement those plans.]{.underline}

"We're sort of on pins and needles right now," Reuter said of the wait
to see what emerges from the closed-door negotiations.

[Carolyn Berndt, the National League of Cities' legislative director for
sustainability, also said in an interview the proposal could be a
"significant complement" to the climate-related funding in the
bipartisan infrastructure law Biden signed last year.]{.underline}

Should it be similar to the House bill, [a new proposal could fund an
array of grants aimed at areas like retrofitting buildings, reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, increasing electric vehicle purchases,
removing lead pipes, and helping communities deal with air pollution
from wildfires---all with an emphasis on helping disadvantaged
communities.]{.underline}

special rules that require a mere simple majority \-- or in this case
just Democratic votes \-- for final passage, with Vice President Kamala
Harris breaking an expected tie.]{.underline}

\-- originally carrying a \$2.2 trillion price tag but is expected to be
dramatically reduced in the revised version \-- would only exacerbate
inflation.

to be finalized for weeks, according to two Democratic aides, but this
deal announced Wednesday was submitted to the Senate\'s rules-keeper,

of ensuring the measure fits within the strictures of the expedited
process Democrats intend to employ, called \"reconciliation,\" according
to a source familiar with the matter.

#### High drug prices lead to millions of deaths and wastes billions of dollars\-\--robust data set.

**CISDA 20** (The Council for Informed Drug Spending Analysis (CIDSA),
brings independent experts together to build consensus on effective,
evidence-based policies to reduce drug spending. "High Drug Prices and
Patient Costs: Millions of Lives and Billions of Dollars Lost," November
18, 2020. Accessed July 10, 2022.
<https://www.cidsa.org/publications/xcenda-summary>, AK)

Key Findings:

[By 2030, on average:]{.underline}

[**112,000 seniors each year could die prematurely** because drug prices
and associated cost-sharing are so high that they cannot afford their
medication.]{.underline}

Because [high drug prices and patient costs mean seniors cannot afford
their medications, Medicare is projected to spend an additional \$17.7
billion annually on avoidable medical spending because of health
complications.]{.underline}

Medicare negotiation is projected to reduce drug prices and seniors\'
cost-sharing, which could prevent nearly 94,000 seniors' deaths annually
and save \$475.9 billion.

[‍Existing Problem]{.underline}

Medication adherence refers to how well patients follow the instructions
given by their healthcare providers for taking a medication regimen.
While nonadherence can be a result of many factors, [unaffordable drug
prices can significantly impair medication adherence (we call this
"cost-related nonadherence"). When patients are unable to adhere to
their medications because of high prices, medical spending significantly
increases to treat patients' conditions; over time, these complications
can lead to worse health outcomes and premature death.]{.underline}

[The benefit design structure of the Medicare Part D program leaves many
beneficiaries particularly vulnerable to complications from cost-related
nonadherence.]{.underline} Under the standard benefit design, Medicare
beneficiaries are responsible for 25% of a drug's cost until they hit
the out-of-pocket maximum. This means that [even with Medicare
insurance, what seniors pay is linked to a drug's price. This linkage
allows us to model how cost-related nonadherence would change under
policies that would reduce drug prices, such as Medicare negotiation,
and to simultaneously model changes in mortality and avoidable medical
spending that would follow from lower drug prices.]{.underline}

Existing publications on the impact of medication adherence are dated,
using models from the 1990s that do not reflect the efficacy, safety,
and pricing of current treatments. The West Health Policy Center
commissioned Xcenda, the research arm of drug distributor
AmerisourceBergen, to model the current relationship between
cost-related nonadherence and mortality and cost outcomes in the
Medicare program[. This analysis considers the impact of cost-related
nonadherence on the general Medicare population, and on five individual
conditions -- Atrial Fibrillation, Chronic Kidney Disease, Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder, Type 2 Diabetes, and Ischemic Heart
Disease --that significantly affect seniors and for which effective
pharmaceutical treatments are available. Xcenda modeled the impact of
cost-related nonadherence on a ten-year period, from
2021-2031.]{.underline}

[Analysis of Results]{.underline}

[Over the ten-year period, high out-of-pocket costs for drugs are
**estimated to cause 1.1 million premature deaths of seniors** in the
Medicare program and lead to an additional \$177.4 billion in avoidable
Medicare medical costs]{.underline}. [The plurality of premature deaths
is due to cardiac conditions]{.underline} (atrial fibrillation and
ischemic heart disease), causing 354,800 seniors to die prematurely over
the ten-year period. [High drug prices are estimated to contribute to
70,400 premature deaths from chronic kidney disease, 69,300 premature
deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 62,700 premature
deaths from diabetes among seniors by 2031.]{.underline}

**[Reducing drug prices through Medicare negotiation could significantly
reduce the number of premature deaths]{.underline}**. After calibrating
to the Congressional Budget Office's score of H.R.3, the Elijah E.
Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, the model estimates that granting
Medicare the authority to negotiate and limiting drug price increases
could prevent 93,900 deaths per year. These policy changes are projected
to reduce Medicare spending by \$475.9 billion by 2030.

[The Schumer-Manchin negotiations **come amid a mixed backdrop for
Democrats**, who have a shot at keeping control of the Senate but are
battling Biden's unpopularity and public outrage over rising
prices.]{.underline} [Other pieces of Democrats' agenda regarding child
tax credits, education and senior home support are **almost certain to
be sidelined due to Manchin's narrower aspirations.**]{.underline}

[Another possible casualty moving forward]{.underline}, according to
multiple sources, [are more federal subsidies for electric vehicles and
new infrastructure spending to support them. Manchin has publicly panned
over-reliance on electric vehicles as "stupid"]{.underline} when other
countries control much of the supply chain for critical parts and
consistently questioned more federal investment for the growing
industry. [Separately, car companies are asking for Washington to lift a
cap on how many electric automobiles are eligible for existing tax
credits.]{.underline}

Manchin is also interested in advancing more domestic energy talks
outside of the current negotiations, having held bipartisan discussions
with the GOP earlier this year.

"It's no secret that Sen. Manchin --- and many others on both sides of
the aisle --- believe that permitting reform is essential to American
energy security and our ability to decarbonize," Runyon said, adding
that Manchin will "explore all options to responsibly address these
issues."

[Manchin previously signaled he would not support Direct Pay, which
essentially gives cash to clean energy developers to free companies from
having to rely on tax credits. Some Democrats and interest groups are
making a late push with Manchin to include direct pay tax credits for
clean manufacturers]{.underline}, adding those incentives would be
technology neutral. Democrats are also discussing barring large power
companies from the Direct Pay program and focusing on nonprofits.

In order to hit his rough goal of \$500 billion in new spending while
also incorporating extensions for expiring Obamacare subsidies that
could cost roughly \$200 billion, [more energy spending may also be
jettisoned.]{.underline}

[Tax policy remains unfinished as well.]{.underline} Democrats have not
finalized which tax increases on corporations and the wealthy will be
used and international taxation policy remains in flux, according to a
person with direct knowledge of the negotiations.

[The push to wrap up the package comes as Democrats **face two imminent
deadlines**.]{.underline} [While the Obamacare subsidies are technically
set to expire at the end of the year, insurers are locking in rate
increases throughout the summer and fall. The practical deadline for
staving off those rate increases **is likely sometime in
August**.]{.underline} On top of that, [Senate rules dictate that
Democrats have **only until the end of September** to pass a party-line
bill, otherwise they'd have to start from square one.]{.underline}

And there's no margin for error. [Senate Democrats need all 50 of their
members' support in the evenly divided Senate, and that means yes votes
from Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), **plus a return from
Sen. Patrick Leahy**]{.underline} (D-Vt.), [who is recovering from a
broken hip]{.underline}. Coons said he's "communicated" with Leahy and
is "encouraged by his progress." **[Leahy's office hasn't yet indicated
when he'll return to the Senate,]{.underline}** though he was discharged
from the hospital this week.

[Some Democrats are concerned that Sinema is not involved in the Manchin
and Schumer talks, given her different view of tax policy than her West
Virginia colleague, who is more keen on reversing the Trump tax cuts
than she is.]{.underline} Sinema maintains a line of communication with
Democratic leadership, according to a Democratic aide.

#### Doesn't pass. Democrats need an aggressive timetable to pass BBB before August but won't commit to one.

[Democrats involved in the matter **dodged questions about timetables
for passage** of any final deal, cognizant of the fact that an intense
focus on missed deadlines plagued the first iteration of the
legislation.]{.underline}

But **[there is little doubt]{.underline}** [that the month-long August
recess **looms large** with the focus afterward on funding the
government by Oct. 1 and the crucial midterms that may very well alter
the power structure in Congress. Dem**ocrats are also very wary of
scaring off the mercurial Manchin with any pressure,**]{.underline}
despite knowing that a major economic package could potentially boost
their political chances significantly.

### Uniqueness\-\--Climate

[The individuals cautioned that lawmakers and their staff are still
discussing the idea and that no final deal on methane --- or the rest of
their climate agenda --- has been reached. Over the past year,
**Democrats have repeatedly thought they were close to striking an
accord with Manchin, only to see negotiations collapse at the last
moment because of misunderstandings,** miscommunications and lingering
policy differences.]{.underline}

"**[Suggestions that a reconciliation deal is close are
false]{.underline}**," said Sam Runyon, a spokesman for Manchin, in a
statement. ["Senator Manchin still has **serious unresolved concerns**
and there is a lot of work to be done before it's conceivable that a
deal can be reached he can sign onto."]{.underline}

Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Schumer, said [any mention of a final
deal is "speculation," adding: "We continue to have productive
conversations."]{.underline}

But Senate Environment and Public Works Chair Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.),
whose panel has jurisdiction over the methane fee, believes the
potential compromise would ensure that companies are reducing their
methane emissions regardless of EPA regulations, those familiar with the
matter said. Finding a legislative solution to the issue has taken on
added significance since the Supreme Court last week limited the EPA's
powers to curb greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.

The haggling over climate provisions comes after Democratic leaders
finalized a plan to lower prescription drug prices for seniors,
signaling progress on another key pillar of their economic agenda. Under
the plan, the federal government would for the first time be allowed to
negotiate the price of certain drugs on behalf of Medicare
beneficiaries. Some party lawmakers saw the development as crucial
toward crafting a broader package that could come to the Senate floor as
soon as the end of July, a timeline Schumer previously outlined to his
caucus.

But [a wide array of issues --- about the size, scope and cost of the
package --- remain up for debate.]{.underline}

[On climate, for example, Democrats are still wrangling with Manchin
over a tax credit for electric vehicles. The West Virginia lawmaker has
voiced concern that the tax incentive could be a handout for wealthy
Americans who purchase expensive electric cars.]{.underline} While the
issue is unresolved, a potential compromise could involve "means
testing," in which the tax credit would be restricted to consumers who
earn below certain income thresholds.

[Another unresolved issue concerns a suite of tax credits for producers
of clean energy from sources such as wind and solar power. Manchin has
indicated that he **will not support a spending bill that includes
what's known as direct pay**]{.underline}, in which payments are sent
directly to companies that produce clean energy for consumers. A
potential compromise could involve restricting eligibility for direct
pay to nonprofits, according to one person familiar with the matter.

[The overall price tag of the climate and energy provisions in the
spending bill could total around \$300 billion to \$350
billion]{.underline}, though the amount will change as negotiations
continue. That pales in comparison with the \$555 billion climate
package in the earlier version of the bill that passed the House last
year.

[Manchin has argued that such spending could add to the national debt
and worsen inflation as prices are skyrocketing]{.underline}. **[But the
smaller amount on environmental programs may be difficult to accept for
some liberal House lawmakers,]{.underline}** [who view the measure as
their last chance to pass robust climate legislation before the midterm
elections this fall, when Republicans could wrest control of
Congress.]{.underline}

["I wanted more than \$555 billion to meet the moment on climate," Rep.
Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), deputy whip of the Congressional Progressive
Caucus, said in an interview Thursday.]{.underline} "I was in meetings
at the White House where I pushed for more.\"

However, Khanna said he would encourage fellow liberal House members to
accept any climate deal that emerges in the Senate.

"The alternative is zero dollars," he said. \"Significant investment is
much better than zero."

### Internal\-\--Inflation

#### BBB makes inflation worse. It kills innovation and drives aggregate demand.

**de Rugy 7/7** (Veronique de Rugy, Ph.D., is a contributing editor
at ***Reason.*[ ]{.underline}**She is a senior research fellow at
the [Mercatus Center](http://www.mercatus.org/) at George Mason
University. "Democrats Are Trying To Push Through Another \'Build Back
Better\' Bill. It Would Only Make Inflation Worse." Reason. July 7,
2022. Accessed July 10, 2022.

AK)

[The go-to policy for dealing with nearly every modern problem is more
government spending.]{.underline} So it was just a matter of time before
[Democrats tried to revive the failed \"Build Back Better\" (BBB)
program to address today\'s economic troubles. Of course, if they
succeed, the result will be much the same as what we\'ve experienced
over the past 18 months: **more debt and rising
inflation.**]{.underline}

As a reminder, the \$2 trillion proposed BBB legislation came on the
tail of an oversized \$2 trillion third COVID-19 relief bill and a \$1
trillion infrastructure bill. It was killed when Sens. Joe Manchin
(D--W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D--Ariz.) joined all Republican senators
in opposition. [They rightfully worried that more spending would inflate
our debt and produce inflation. But now, their party is back at it
again. In the midst of the largest inflation in four decades, they\'ve
been negotiating behind the scenes for weeks in hopes of passing a
slimmer BBB.]{.underline}

According to Politico, they hope to pass the bill before September by
using the budget reconciliation process. The bill includes tax
increases, deficit-reduction measures, prescription-drug reform, and
renewable-energy subsidies, but most of the details are still unclear.
[If we wind up with more of the spending and favoritism that\'s become
so common, it would be tragic.]{.underline}

First and worst, [these policies are **destined to be
counterproductive**. Subsidies to suppliers of green energy, for
instance, **increase the cost of that energy and hinder the innovation**
that could make it more commonplace. The Democrats\' prescription-drug
policy would be costly and in the long run perhaps even
deadly.]{.underline} As the Paragon Institute\'s Brian Blase recently
wrote in a newsletter, [\"Former Chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers Tomas Philipson...estimates that these proposals would lead to
**135 fewer new drug approvals** over the next two decades. This reduced
innovation would translate into a loss of life years many times larger
than the life years lost from COVID-19.\"]{.underline}

Second, [as the spending flows through the economy, **it will continue
to fuel inflation**.]{.underline} [The recent price hikes are caused by
irresponsible fiscal and monetary policies during the pandemic, followed
by a failure to implement---or even talk about---policies for reducing
the budget deficit and debt once the crisis passed]{.underline}. Indeed,
[one of the implicit fiscal rules that politicians have lived by until
now is that while government can spend big during an emergency, it
should go on a diet once the emergency is over. Doing **otherwise might
trigger a calamitous suspicion that the government will fail to repay
its debt** and instead rely on inflation to chip away at
it.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [another huge spending spike is costly especially if paid
for with borrowed money. It is particularly expensive at a time when the
Federal Reserve is hiking interest rates to tame inflation]{.underline}.
Thirty percent of U.S. debt needs to be rolled over within a year.
[Higher interest rates mean higher interest payments on our debt, a
difference in cost that will be felt rapidly.]{.underline}

Finally, higher interest rates and the resulting slowing of the economy
could reduce inflation---but [that could be a costly and short-lived
victory unless Congress implements austerity. Any initial success in
taming inflation could backfire by temporarily increasing households\'
real wealth and interest receipts from bond investments.]{.underline} In
this scenario, **[more wealth and higher incomes end up boosting the
aggregate demand that\'s been driving inflation]{.underline}**.
Implementing a fiscal consolidation plan would reduce the wealth effect
and keep inflation under control. On the other hand, [adding more
spending to the economy, like most Democrats want to do, would aggravate
the wealth effect and fuel demand-driven inflation.]{.underline}

As the Hoover Institution\'s John Cochrane reminds us, **[this is
exactly what happened during the Great Inflation.]{.underline}** He
writes: [\"In 1970 and 1974, the Fed raised interest rates more promptly
and more sharply than now, from 4% to 9% in 1970 and from 3.5% to 13% in
1974. Each rise produced a bruising recession. Each reduced inflation.
Each time, inflation roared back.\" This is what will happen if the
Biden administration fails to implement austerity or, even worse, if it
uses fears of an upcoming recession as an excuse to increase spending
and the debt further.]{.underline}

A soft landing was never a credible option. [Once inflation starts,
there\'s no easy way out. But there are plenty of ways to make things
worse and more painful. **This is what will happen if Democrats proceed
with their current BBB plan.**]{.underline}
