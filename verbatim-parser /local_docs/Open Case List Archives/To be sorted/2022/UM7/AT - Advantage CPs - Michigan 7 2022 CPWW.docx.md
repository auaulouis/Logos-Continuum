#### Net Assessment is a failure and waste of money

**Senator** Chuck **Grassley**, 2-7-20**22**, \"Grassley: The Office of
Net Assessment is a Failure,\"
<https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/remarks/grassley-the-office-of-net-assessment-is-a-failure>
GH-PJ

Accordingly, it appears that the [[O]{.mark}ffice of [N]{.mark}et
[A]{.mark}ssessment gets to keep [operat]{.mark}ing [like]{.mark} a
Pentagon [slush fund]{.mark} for irrelevant and political research
projects.]{.underline} On [February 5,
2020](https://www.grassley.senate.gov/download/2020-02-05-ona-to-ceg-halper-follow-up),
the Director of the Office of Net Assessment told me, "We review all
deliverables to ensure they're consistent with the statement of work. We
evaluate each deliverable to assess whether we should seek additional
information or require a resubmission of commissioned work." I'll return
to that statement in a bit. In [December
2020](https://www.grassley.senate.gov/download/2020-12-18-ceg-to-dod-ig-ona-evaluation),
I asked the inspector general to take a deeper dive into the Office of
Net Assessment's contracting practices. That means connecting all the
dots in the contract transactions to ensure everything matches up.
[[The]{.mark} [inspector general reviewed 20 contracts]{.mark}. [On
[January 25,
2022](http://www.dodig.mil/Reports/Audits-and-Evaluations/Article/2913927/audit-of-the-office-of-net-assessments-contract-administration-procedures-dodig/),
the]{.mark} inspector [general issued its results and found,]{.mark} in
part:]{.underline} · [[O]{.mark}ffice of [N]{.mark}et
[A]{.mark}ssessment acquisition [personnel **inappropriately
performed**]{.mark} Contracting Officer Representative [duties for **20
contracts.**]{.mark}]{.underline} · [[ONA]{.mark} acquisition personnel
and an office providing contract support **[didn't maintain complete
contract files]{.mark}**, including pre-award and contract
administration documentation]{.underline}. [That also included the
failure to maintain signed contracts and modifications.]{.underline}
Since 2019, I've repeatedly asked for a full accounting of Stefan
Halper's contracts. Either they never had one or they've decided to
obstruct Congress. · [[ONA]{.mark} acquisition [personnel]{.mark} and an
office providing contract support [inappropriately approved
invoices]{.mark} for payments [totaling **9.8 million dollars**]{.mark}
due to a lack of oversight. [And that's **just for**]{.mark} **the [20
contracts]{.mark}** the Inspector General sampled.]{.underline} Without
required supporting documentation for payment, [[the door is wide open
to fraud, theft and improper payments]{.mark}.]{.underline} · Without
established and documented surveillance measures for ONA service
contracts, the Office of Net Assessment may not have received all
services outlined in contractor statements of work. · At this point, the
next finding is no surprise: [the [ONA]{.mark} [didn't administer
contracts in accordance with federal]{.mark}, Defense Department and
Washington Headquarters Services internal [regulations and
policies]{.mark}.]{.underline} Further, the audit states,
"[[O]{.mark}ffice of [N]{.mark}et [A]{.mark}ssessment Acquisition
[personnel can't verify whether they received services, valued at **4.1
million**]{.mark} **dollars**, [in accordance with the statement]{.mark}
of work]{.underline}." Now, let's return to that quote from the Director
of the ONA, "We review all deliverables to ensure they're consistent
with the statement of work. We evaluate each deliverable to assess
whether we should seek additional information or require a resubmission
of commissioned work." Based on the available evidence, his statement is
false. Here's the bottom line: [the [ONA has no clue what they're
paying]{.mark} for [and whether they've]{.mark} even [received]{.mark}
complete work [product]{.mark}. [And]{.mark} whatever they're actually
doing, [it's not in compliance with federal regulations, policy and
law]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is a complete embarrassment and a slap in
the face to the American taxpayer. While [the [ONA]{.mark} **[wasted
millions of dollars]{.mark}** in taxpayer money [every
year]{.mark}]{.underline}, the communist Chinese government developed
hypersonic missiles that can travel the globe. If this unit isn't doing
the job they're supposed to do, why are we still funding it? It'd be
better to take their 20 million dollar budget and give it our service
members. At least we know they've earned it. A government slush fund
will always be a government slush fund unless the Congress steps up and
fixes the problem.

## AT: Ukraine Intervention

#### Perm do both -- CP isn't mutually exclusive to the aff

#### Ukraine is already a zone for potential nuclear or even chemical escalation -- intervention guarantees escalation

Malcolm **Davis**, 5-4-20**22**, \"Will Putin go nuclear to avoid defeat
in Ukraine?,\" Strategist,
<https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/will-putin-go-nuclear-to-avoid-defeat-in-ukraine/>
GH-PJ

[In 2022 the world faces a new nuclear threat, with the risk that
Russian President Vladimir Putin's [invasion of Ukraine]{.mark} [could
turn into a wider war]{.mark} between NATO and Moscow [that escalates
past the nuclear threshold or]{.mark}, alternatively, Russia's use of
[a]{.mark} [[tactical]{.mark} [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon](https://dc.medill.northwestern.edu/blog/2018/02/09/exactly-low-yield-nuclear-weapon/#sthash.NpMxbirP.dpbs)
in Ukraine.]{.underline} CIA Director William Burns
[said](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-nuclear-weapons-burns-cia/31804539.html)
on 14 April: '[[Given]{.mark} [the]{.mark} potential
[desperation]{.mark} of President Putin and the Russian leadership,
given [the setbacks]{.mark} that they've faced so far, militarily, [none
of us can take lightly the threat]{.mark} posed [by a]{.mark}
[potential]{.mark} resort to tactical [nuc]{.mark}lear weapons or
low-yield nuclear weapons.' [A Russian]{.mark} [defeat at the
conventional]{.mark} military [level]{.mark} [would]{.mark} [increase
the likelihood of Putin going nuclear]{.mark}, perhaps as part of a
[strategy](https://thebulletin.org/2022/03/russian-military-doctrine-calls-a-limited-nuclear-strike-de-escalation-heres-why/)
of 'escalate to de-escalate' in which a low-yield tactical nuclear
weapon is detonated [in Ukraine]{.mark}. Such a move would either seek
to turn the tide of battle or serve as a warning shot to Kyiv and NATO
to accept Russia's terms for ending the war.]{.underline} It's also
possible that Russia could decide to escalate at a conventional level by
extending its attacks beyond Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov [has
accused](https://www.reuters.com/world/response-lavrov-comments-us-says-talk-nuclear-escalation-is-irresponsible-2022-04-26/)
NATO of engaging in a proxy war and said that weapons shipments are
legitimate targets. And [Russia is already making implied threats of
[extending the
war](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/26/moldova-ukraine-war-putin-russia/)
to the disputed Transnistria region of
[Moldova](https://olgalautman.substack.com/p/russia-sets-their-eye-on-moldova?r=k8nwv&s=w&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web).]{.underline}
[That would dramatically increase the threat to Romania, a NATO member,
and destabilise the Moldovan state, many of whose residents are
ethnically Romanian. Perhaps most worryingly,]{.underline} **[[Putin
recently doubled down on the nuclear rhetoric]{.underline}]{.mark}**
with an [implicit
threat](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Ukraine-war/Ukraine-war-Free-to-read/Ukraine-from-April-12-to-April-28-Putin-warns-West-of-lightning-fast-retaliation):
If someone intends to intervene in the ongoing events from the outside
and create strategic threats for Russia that are unacceptable to us,
they should know that our retaliatory strikes will be lightning-fast. We
have all the tools for this, things no one else can boast of having now.
And we will not boast---[**[we will use them if necessary]{.mark}**. And
I want everyone to know that.]{.underline} With the West expanding its
assistance to Ukraine, the possibility that Putin could interpret it as
intervention generates another pathway to escalation. [[It's not clear
how NATO would respond to]{.mark} the use of [a]{.mark} low-yield
[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon in Ukraine---[or]{.mark}, for that matter,
large-scale use of [chemical weapons]{.mark} against Ukrainian targets.
The [chemical weapons]{.mark} scenario [is]{.mark} perhaps more
[likely]{.mark}, [given that norms]{.mark} [of non-use]{.mark} of
chemical weapons [have already been eroded by Syria]{.mark}'s
large-scale use of a range of them against its own people in
2014.]{.underline} Use of such weapons by Russia might simply attract
intensified sanctions and political condemnation. [Tactical nuclear use
would be a different matter altogether. [Use of a nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon---even a low-yield tactical weapon---[would represent]{.mark}
**[a fundamental shift in global security]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [[It
would shatter the norm of non-use]{.mark} of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, and absent an effective response by NATO, [would
usher in a new era in which [states would perceive such weapons as
credible options for warfighting]{.mark}, [not]{.mark} [just]{.mark} for
[deterrence]{.mark}. [Other]{.mark} nuclear-armed [states]{.mark}
[might]{.mark} move to [prioritise low-yield]{.mark} tactical
[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}, [and non-nuclear states]{.mark} that
had nuclear ambitions, [such as Iran,]{.mark} [might decide that]{.mark}
participating in [non-prolif]{.mark}eration and arms control [is no
longer a priority]{.mark}]{.underline}. Negotiations on restoring the
nuclear deal with Iran could become a casualty of nuclear escalation in
Ukraine and North Korea is already well into
[developing](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/04/26/asia-pacific/north-korea-parade-kim-nuclear/)
a range of new tactical nuclear forces. Of course, not responding---or
responding weakly, such as with intensified economic sanctions and
political condemnation---isn't the only option open to NATO in the event
Russia uses a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine. Direct military
intervention at a conventional level, to strike at Russian
nuclear-capable delivery systems, would be one option; another would be
deployment of NATO forces on the ground to directly support Ukrainian
forces in battle. [But [any]{.mark} direct military
[intervention]{.mark} by NATO, even below the nuclear threshold,
[would]{.mark} almost [inevitably lead to a wider]{.mark} NATO--Russia
[war]{.mark}, and [with]{.mark} it, [the]{.mark} near [certainty]{.mark}
[of nuclear escalation]{.mark}.]{.underline} It's that spectre of
nuclear war---as opposed to a single detonation---that constrains NATO's
responses, even in the face of Russian atrocities in Bucha and
Kramatorsk. In particular, the prospect of such a war escalating to
strategic nuclear exchanges and devastating the planet will be in the
minds of NATO decisionmakers.

[[Governments]{.mark}, regimes, and leaders [do not act against]{.mark}
[their]{.mark} self-defined [interest]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
financial crisis provides an ideal example because before he was
treasury secretary, Paulson had worked closely with Chinese leaders for
decades, including as the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs.
But even he couldn't get the Chinese to do some things during the 2008
crisis. [At the end of the day, [U.S. and Chinese actions are dictated
by U.S. and Chinese interests]{.mark}.]{.underline} And it requires
incredibly hard work by people with vision, persistence, and a sense of

altruistic joint action]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [But [it is hard to
solve real problems]{.mark} that affect real people the
world]{.underline} over when the two most significant actors in the
international system not only are not coordinating but are actually
working at cross purposes, even if they are doing so for their own
purposes. [[The question]{.mark} facing the international system [is
whether and how the countries]{.mark}, governments, and peoples
[affected by what happens]{.mark} between Beijing and Washington [can
get those two to coordinate]{.mark} on things that really matter to the

[[what does the rest of the world do if no crisis is truly big
enough]{.mark} anymore [to elicit]{.mark} even modest
[coop]{.mark}eration between Beijing and Washington? The world surely
won't be better off.]{.underline} And past episodes of coordination and

in the event of an invasion, according to a professor at the Middlebury

ability to use a small number of nuclear weapons against the United
States, said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor on arms control. "They have some
deterrence, but what I think [[the North Koreans really]{.mark},
fundamentally [want]{.mark} is [the ability to]{.mark} [use a]{.mark}

he said. His comments came after [North Korea conducted another missile
test on
Sunday](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/17/north-korean-leader-kim-observes-missile-test-to-boost-nuclear-capabilities-.html).
State news agency KCNA reported that Kim "gave important instructions on
further building up the defense capabilities and nuclear combat forces
of the country." "[North Koreans are really committed to shifting their
nuclear policy,]{.underline}" according to Lewis. He said the missile
looked like "yet another variant" of a short-range one and that it's
"more of the same" from North Korea --- but it's "still quite
unwelcome." According to Lewis, [North Korea is now working toward a
nuclear weapons test, more than four years since its last one in 2017.
"]{.underline}In a sense, [[the gloves are off]{.mark}," he said. "[They
don't]{.mark} really [feel bound by any of the commitments they
made]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2018 when the diplomacy period started, and
[[we're]{.mark} also [seeing]{.mark} a lot of [activity at the nuclear
test site."]{.mark}]{.underline} During his presidency, U.S. President
[Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) held two summits with
Kim to [discuss denuclearization on the Korean
peninsula.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/12/trump-and-kim-sign-agreement-document-after-summit-in-singapore.html)
The second one, in Hanoi, ended abruptly when the [two sides were unable
to agree on the removal of
sanctions.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/28/white-house-trump-kim-meetings-change-of-schedule.html)
[North Korea closed the entrances to its nuclear test tunnels in 2018,
but they have likely already reopened them, Lewis said. Satellite images
taken in March showed [construction at the site where North Korea has
conducted all its previous nuclear
tests](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nkorea-appears-be-restoring-its-dismantled-nuclear-test-site-2022-03-15/),]{.underline}
Reuters reported. It's now up Kim to decide when he wants to test a
nuclear weapon, the professor said. "If we know one thing, we know that
there's going to be a nuclear test when Kim Jong Un feels like it," he
added.

Smart Grids are better than traditional legacy power grids in terms of

Grid. The benefits of using a Smart Grid in the overall perspective, it
will provide a wider range of security with having various techniques
and techniques to overcome some of the cyber-attack issues. However,
while conducting the research, the various paper has suggested the
security benefits and vulnerability related Smart Grids, almost
[**[every]{.mark} research [paper]{.mark}** [suggested that
**threatening weakness** for Smart Grids would be]{.mark} the

Smart Grid will protect the Availability of the service with multiple
layers of security an optimal solution for the security aspects would be
using the Virtual Private Network (VPN) for more secure communication.
Moreover, concluding this research, self-awareness related to
cyber-attack in Smart Grids is important. The user should be aware of
the risks related to the Smart Grid and mitigate them by doing various
risk assessments and case studies to provide a further solution in
protecting the Smart Grid against different types of cyber-attack.
Additionally, [the research addressed [possible]{.mark}

technology could help resolve security issues by providing a shared and
encrypted ledger that is immutable to changes made by malicious nodes or
attackers. It can also be utilized to verify identities and authorize
access by storing and recording transactions in the immutable ledger and
make data exchanges between distributed gadgets smooth and
cost-efficient. In conclusion, the computer network protocols need to be
modified according to the current posture of communication as well as
providing sophisticated encryption methods and to offer security
countermeasures. Therefore, it will provide defense against evolved

[could help sat]{.mark}ellite [op]{.mark}erator[s]{.mark} [sleep]{.mark}
a little [easier.]{.mark}** [The]{.mark} prototype
[system]{.mark},]{.underline} [[developed]{.mark} [by]{.mark} the U.S.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ([NOAA]{.mark}), [is
designed to alert op]{.mark}erator[s]{.mark} [when their]{.mark}
space[craft]{.mark} [may be on a collision course]{.mark} with another
object.]{.underline} That\'s a real and growing concern, given how
[crowded Earth orbit is
becoming](https://www.space.com/space-junk-threat-satellites-guidelines-reduce-orbital-debris.html).
[The system,]{.underline} which was demonstrated in a [webcast press
conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAJE7VpOelo) on Feb. 11, [is
called the Open-Architecture Data Repository ([OADR]{.mark}).
[I]{.mark}t\'[s]{.mark} [a cloud database that keeps tabs]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} [the]{.mark} growing [population in
[Earth](https://www.space.com/54-earth-history-composition-and-atmosphere.html)
orbit and warns]{.mark} if there\'s a danger [of a collision]{.mark},
[just as you might get a weather warning]{.mark} if you\'re in the path
of a storm]{.underline}. It works like this: [The [OADR collects data on
space conditions from]{.mark} a number of different [scans from ground
sensors that together cover much of the globe]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[The OADR is linked]{.mark} both [to US]{.mark}-government-[affiliated
ground stations and to a]{.mark} network of [commercial
stations]{.mark}]{.underline} (especially in the Southern Hemisphere).
[The data also includes [space
weather](https://www.space.com/space-weather) observations and other
satellites\' live telemetry and maneuvering plans. [The OADR]{.mark}
takes in all that data and [creates a picture]{.mark} [of the orbital
environment]{.mark}, which [it]{.mark} then uses to [assess]{.mark} [if
there are any looming \"conjunctions]{.mark}\" --- close encounters
between orbiting objects. If there are any, the [OADR]{.mark} [can relay
that]{.mark} data back [to sat]{.mark}ellite [op]{.mark}erator[s]{.mark}
as a sort of weather forecast, [giving]{.mark}
[them]{.mark}]{.underline} (ideally) **[[several days to move]{.mark}
their satellite out of the way.]{.underline}** \"A hurricane
notification displays a probability cone that continually changes as new
data is obtained,\" Scott Leonard, Special Advisor to the Director of
NOAA\'s Office of Space Commerce, said in the Feb. 11 press conference.
\"A conjunction is similar.\" OADR is still under development; the newly
unveiled system is a prototype. According to Leonard, the OADR team
still needs to iron out some kinks with automating data collection and
prediction processes. [[If all goes according to plan, the OADR will see
initial public operation by 2024 and be **fully operational by
2025.**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[There are already a number of commercial
firms providing these sorts of space-tracking
services,]{.underline}]{.mark} but the OADR\'s creators hope that it
will ultimately have more data than those services --- and better
predictive capabilities to boot. It\'s hardly a secret that Earth orbit
is getting quite crowded. There are already [at least 23,000
objects](https://www.space.com/space-junk-growing-problem-complicated-solution)
in space with a diameter of 4 inches (10 centimeters) or greater. That
number really began to explode in the 21st century, and it isn\'t
slowing down. "We expect on the order of 57,000 new satellites by the
year 2030,\" Stephen Volz, assistant secretary of commerce for
environmental observation at NOAA, said in the press conference. And
in-space collisions aren\'t just the stuff of nightmare fantasy. Last
year, for example, a [Chinese military satellite
collided](https://www.space.com/space-junk-collision-chinese-satellite-yunhai-1-02)
with a piece of a 25-year-old Russian rocket. The satellites of
SpaceX\'s Starlink broadband constellation, which may someday consist of

Protecting existing forests and planting new ones are surely good things
to do. However[, scientists say [**we must not place too much faith in
trees** to save us]{.mark}]{.underline}. In particular, last year one
research group claimed we can plant a trillion extra trees and [remove a
quarter of the carbon dioxide currently in the
air](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aax0848). These figures have been
widely criticised as overhyped and unreliable. [[Trees will]{.mark}
definitely [help]{.mark} us slow climate change, [but they won't reverse
it]{.mark} on their own.]{.underline} [[The]{.mark} underlying
[problem]{.mark} [is that our society is releasing]{.mark}
[g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}ase[s]{.mark}, especially carbon
dioxide (CO2), that are warming the Earth's climate]{.underline} to
levels we have never experienced before. As a result the great ice
sheets are melting, contributing to rising seas, and extreme weather
events like hurricanes and droughts are becoming more severe. [[The
solution is to **stop emitting**]{.mark} **all greenhouse
gases,**]{.underline} for instance by replacing fossil fuels with
renewable energy sources like solar power. Deforestation is actually one
of the biggest sources of carbon dioxide, because when trees are cut
down much of the carbon stored within them escapes into the air --
especially if the wood is burned. For instance, in 2017 land use changes
-- mostly deforestation -- contributed [four billion tonnes of
CO2](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2152929-bad-news-carbon-emissions-have-suddenly-started-rising-again/)
emissions to [the global total of 41 billion tonnes of
CO2](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-10-2141-2018). In other words, if we
stopped cutting down trees we would cut our annual emissions by about
10%.

#### Their author admitted that their study is incorrect

Michael **Marshall**, 26th May 20**20**, \"Planting trees doesn't always

By some estimates, trees can be an enormous carbon sink. [[A
study]{.mark} published [in]{.mark} July [2019]{.mark}, [led by]{.mark}
[Thomas
[Crowther]{.mark}](https://usys.ethz.ch/en/people/profile.tom-crowther.html)
of ETH-Zurich in Switzerland, [estimated the world has]{.mark}
[room]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [an extra [0.9 billion hectares of
forest]{.mark}](https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2019/07/how-trees-could-save-the-climate.html)]{.underline}.
[Once those trees had
matured](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-48870920), they
could store 752 billion tonnes of CO2. Planting trees, the team wrote,
is "[one of the most effective carbon drawdown solutions to
date](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aax0848)". This finding has had
immediate, fierce pushback from other climate scientists. [In October
2019, the journal [Science]{.mark} [published
[four](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaz0388)
[highly](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aay8060)
[critical](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aay7976)
[comments](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aay8334)]{.mark}. These
argued that [the researchers had overestimated the carbon trees could
store]{.mark} -- **[by a factor of five]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They
also highlighted multiple mistakes. For instance, [[much of the
land]{.mark} Crowther described as "available" for tree planting
[already has plants]{.mark} growing on it, [all of them storing
carbon]{.mark}, **many of [which would have to be
removed]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} according to [Sonia
Seneviratne](https://iac.ethz.ch/people-iac/person-detail.html?persid=54778)
of ETH-Zurich and her colleagues. The criticism hit home and, [[in May

[they admitted that]{.mark} some of [their]{.mark} headline [claims were

BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA,
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222>\] //
DHS WAgustin 🛏

**[Pakistan and India have]{.underline}** **[engaged in
military]{.underline}** and nuclear **[CBMs]{.underline}** [on numerous
occasions]{.underline}, despite non-cordial relations. The
**[first]{.underline}** **[step]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** the
**[military CBMs was the establishment of a hotline]{.underline}**
**[between the militaries]{.underline}** in 1971 following the model of
the United States' and USSR\'s military communications in the same
timeframe ([Ahmar
2001](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222),
87). However, **[the hotline]{.underline}** between the Director
Generals of Military Operations of both countries **[remained
symbolic]{.underline}**, **[and no practical advantages were effectively
achieved for maintaining peaceful relations]{.underline}**. The
**[hotline works well during peacetime]{.underline}** **[while it gets
suspended during crises build-ups, rendering it, in essence,
useless]{.underline}**. The sitting prime ministers of both countries,
Benazir Bhutto and Rajiv Gandhi, signed the next major CBM under the
umbrella of the Nuclear Threat Initiatives. **[This CBM aimed to prevent
attacks]{.underline}** **[on each other\'s nuclear
facilities]{.underline}** **[but does not provide any prevention against
foreign allies attacking such installations]{.underline}**. This measure
enabled the exchange of a list of nuclear facilities between both the
countries in 1992 (Shahid-ur-Rehman Khan
[1992](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222))
which helped to build trust and both the nuclear rivals respected the
arrangements during the peace as well as during times of increased
crisis. In 1991, Pakistan and India\'s CBMs progressed further as they
signed an agreement for prior notification regarding military exercises
and air space violations, especially near the LoC. This set of CBMs
opened further channels of communication in the military and diplomatic
domains to avoid the repetition of earlier crises but it could not
achieve the desired results owing to the non-availability of
implementation structures. The next CBM milestone was the 1992 agreement
on the complete prohibition of chemical weapons---both countries
declared that they do not possess any chemical weapons. However, these
CBMs suffered a considerable setback once India declared its chemical
weapons arsenal under the Chemical Weapons Convention ([Nuclear Threat
Initiative
2011a](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).
Such incidents created further suspicion between both countries---which
were already having problematic relations---and halted the advancement
in the process of confidence building. Pakistan considered the incident
as a violation of the bilateral agreement which widened the gulf in
trust deficit between the two countries. In the wake of this incident,
no further progress was achieved until 1999. Later, Nawaz Sharif and
Vajpayee concluded the Lahore Accord in 1999, which was a milestone
agreement for peacebuilding following the nuclear tests in 1998. This
agreement incorporated the concept of developing and employing CBMs in
both the conventional military and nuclear domains to avoid any untoward
nuclear weapons launch situations and to reduce the prospects for future
conflicts ([Nuclear Threat Initiative
2011b](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).
Unfortunately, this set of CBMs was undermined by the Kargil Conflict,
which started a few months after the declaration. This time it was the
Pakistani side that undermined the peace efforts as political and
military leaderships were not on the same page. Here the political
leadership tried to put some mechanisms in place for peaceful
coexistence, but the military institution spoiled these efforts. This
problem necessitates the requirement of structures that can implement
and sustain CBMs without significant interference from any state
institution, military in particular. From 1999 to 2003, tensions
remained high between both the states due to large-scale deployments
along the LoC, plus terrorist attacks in Srinagar and on the Indian
parliament. The UN General Assembly session of 2003 carved out a route
toward a ceasefire and later on to direct negotiations between the
political leadership of both countries ([Khawaja
2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222),
120--121). A new set of military and nuclear CBMs was then worked upon
which included the reduction of troops along the LoC, no further
development of military posts, and prior information regarding the
testing of ballistic missiles ([Krepon
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).
The composite dialogue process constituted a major step forward which
aimed to resolve the issues between both countries through a strategy
that satisfies the demands of both countries ([Padder
2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).
This dialogue process provided the opportunity to discuss the peace
process through a diverse range of domains including the Kashmir issue.
However, all these CBMs halted in 2008 ([Gul
2007](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222))
after the terrorist attacks in Mumbai for which India blamed Pakistan.
Later, very few efforts were initiated in 2014 and 2015, but those did
not work due to pre-existing notions of trust deficit and further
accusations of terrorist attacks. [The primary issues in the
implementation of the military and nuclear CBMs]{.underline} **[are the
non-availability of a framework, transparency issues, and lack of
trust]{.underline}**. [Political aspects will also play a significant
role in the success of any military and nuclear CBMs]{.underline},
**[yet military and security concerns continue to undermine political
will]{.underline}** between these two states. While Pakistan and India
are so-called democratic countries, they do not have liberal democratic
structures and the separation of powers remains a contentious issue.
Additionally, [the policies adopted through CBMs]{.underline} **[proved
to be thoroughly incompatible]{.underline}** with follow-up actions
because the military and political leadership in both countries remained
suspicious of each other. **[These issues obstructed the implementation
of military and nuclear CBMs in both letter and spirit]{.underline}**.
The recurring crises between Pakistan and India after the Pulwama
attacks of 2019 highlight the shortfalls of the concept of nuclear
deterrence between both South Asian neighbors. Cyberspace also provides
a new domain for waging wars and there are no existing agreements
between Pakistan and India in this domain. A cyber-attack may prove
disastrous in provoking an unintentional war in the region ([Yamin
2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).

## AT: Russian Sanctions

#### Sanctions fail -- They hurt the people NOT the military or leaders

Rami Al-Khalifa Al-Ali 6-5-22 Writer for Saudi Gazette \[The failure of
Western sanctions against Russia,
<https://www.zawya.com/en/world/uk-and-europe/the-failure-of-western-sanctions-against-russia-gycrd12k>\]
//DHS WAgustin

[Historically]{.underline}, **[sanctions have failed to achieve any
political goals]{.underline}**. **[It is the worst weapon]{.underline}**
that the modern and contemporary **[international system has
produced]{.underline}**. **[Every time when sanctions were
imposed]{.underline}**, **[it was the people who paid the
price]{.underline}**, **[while these sanctions failed to harm the
leaders and officials in the targeted countries.]{.underline}** With the
beginning of the Russian war on Ukraine, a series of Western sanctions
are being slapped on the Russian side, and that has covered almost all
fields. This is up to the extent that one of the Western universities
canceled a lecture on Tolstoy on the pretext that he was a Russian! [The
Western nations wished that their sanctions would be so crushing and
thus deal a fatal blow to the Russian economy, **and hence they have
frozen Russian deposits as well as Russian assets abroad, leaving no
room for the Western hand to reach unless it was punished.** The worst
scenario was the]{.underline} **[attempt to isolate Russia from the
global banking payment system called SWIFT]{.underline}** (The Society
for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) **[as this makes
import and export a very complicated affair even though it would be
possible]{.underline}**. **[The Russian economy absorbed the first
blow]{.underline}**, despite the sagging ruble, but it **[quickly
recovered]{.underline}**, **[and even achieved higher gains than before
the war.]{.underline}** The obvious question that must be asked by
Western circles: what is the purpose of these sanctions? The answer, as
presented by Western politicians, is twofold: the first is the weakening
of the Russian economy, which affects the stability of the Putin
government and undermines confidence in Russian President Vladimir Putin
on the Russian street. However, **[the results of these sanctions were
counterproductive and the proportion of opponents of the war is very
small on the Russian street]{.underline}**, [and President Putin's
popularity is on the rise]{.underline}. [The second aspect is the effect
on the Russian war machine]{.underline}. [It is true that there were
many difficulties experienced by the Russian forces]{.underline},
especially in the beginning of the war, and the failure to capture Kiev,
and this forced the Russian leadership to change its military plans.
**[But this has nothing to do with the Western sanctions]{.underline}**.
Rather, the armed forces, like **[the Russian economy, have regained
their solidity and seemed more capable of achieving breakthroughs and
steady military progress]{.underline}**. This does not mean victory in
the war, but it means that the **[Russian forces were not affected by
the aforesaid sanctions. The Western sanctions on Russia made the supply
of Ukrainian grain a very difficult issue]{.underline}**, even if it was
done in relatively small quantities, and **[Russia\'s isolation from the
SWIFT regime made the supply of Russian grain no less
difficult.]{.underline}** If we know that both countries export 30
percent of the grain worldwide, it can be understood that the food
crisis that the world is beginning to suffer from, and which threatens
impending famines that might afflict a large number of the third world
countries, even though these countries have no part in the Ukrainian war
or in the conflict between the West and Russia. The worst is that the
[European societies themselves have begun to suffer from the rise in the
prices of essential goods,]{.underline} as the prices of fuels increased
by up to 40 percent, and this led to a rise in most essential goods,
especially foodstuffs. After the experience of the past months, **[the
Western sanctions on Russia are like those who shoot themselves in the
feet.]{.underline}** In fact, **[Moscow has benefited from sanctions on
the energy]{.underline}** **[sector]{.underline}**. What it was unable
to export was compensated by the rise in oil prices. It is clear that
the West must change its strategy, and this can only be done by bitterly
admitting that it has failed miserably in its policy of imposing
sanctions against Russia.

// DHS WAgustin 🍞

Fifty years ago this week, former U.S. President Richard Nixon flew to
China, setting the stage for a dramatic shift in relations between the
two countries. Much has changed since that visit, not always for the
better. Despite a flurry of diplomatic activity over the past year,
U.S.-China ties remain tense. Discussions in
[Alaska](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56452471) and
[Tianjin](https://www.state.gov/deputy-secretary-shermans-visit-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china/)
yielded few, if any, breakthroughs. While friendlier in tone, the recent
summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden
led only to
[agreements](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/11/17/xi-biden-summit-us-china-policy/)
to hold yet more talks, albeit on important issues such as strategic
stability. The lone bilateral bright spot has been some cooperation on
[climate](https://www.state.gov/u-s-china-joint-glasgow-declaration-on-enhancing-climate-action-in-the-2020s/).
Since the summit, the [Biden]{.underline} [administration

aimed at countering China's forced labor abuses in Xinjiang. **[The two
sides' antagonistic stances on issues related to]{.underline}**
security, economics**[, technology,]{.underline}** and ideology **[have
largely crystalized, leaving little space for the adjustments that could
relieve simmering tensions.]{.underline}** Below, Paul Haenle and Sam
Bresnick analyze how the two countries got here and how they can move
forward. WHY ARE THE TWO SIDES STUCK? Former U.S. President Donald Trump
ushered in a more confrontational era in U.S.-China relations, and Biden
has largely maintained his predecessor's approach to Beijing, albeit
with a more equanimous tone and embrace of multilateralism. The [U.S.
government has for decades been concerned by China's
mercantilism]{.underline}, rapid military modernization, and illiberal
approach to human rights, but it had held out hope that China might
liberalize through increasingly robust contact with the rest of the
world. That has not happened, and the United States and others have lost
patience with China's state capitalist system, militarization of the
South China Sea, and increasingly [authoritarian
governance](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/world/asia/china-hong-kong-security-law.html).
But Beijing is not backing down. Despite facing pronounced international
pushback during the pandemic, Xi has become even more confident in
China's economic system, governance model, and approach to international
affairs. "Time and momentum are on China's side," he
[argued](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3117314/xi-jinping-says-time-and-momentum-chinas-side-he-sets-out)
last year at a high-level meeting, though many analysts accuse the party
of
[overconfidence](https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Analysis-From-leader-to-students-overconfidence-clouds-China).
At the same time, Chinese officials are increasingly looking askance at
their U.S. counterparts. Many appear to believe that the United States,
though still a formidable power, is in the early stages of an
[inevitable
decline](https://www.economist.com/china/2021/03/31/china-is-betting-that-the-west-is-in-irreversible-decline).
Just as China resumes its rightful place atop the hierarchy of Asian
nations, Beijing's thinking goes, the United States' unresolved racial
justice issues, income inequality, and political polarization will
catalyze an irreversible diminution of U.S. power in Asia and across the
globe. Complicating matters further, the **[U.S. and
Chinese]{.underline}** **[publics]{.underline}** **[are increasingly
distrustful of each other.]{.underline}** A whopping 89 percent of
American respondents to a recent
[survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/03/04/most-americans-support-tough-stance-toward-china-on-human-rights-economic-issues/)
from the Pew Research Center consider China a competitor or enemy, while
around [two-thirds](https://uscnpm.org/the-pulse/) of Chinese
respondents view the United States unfavorably or very unfavorably. Such
negative mutual perceptions would likely hamper each side's ability to
recalibrate its approach to the other. Finally, **[the two sides'
divergent framings of the relationship are contributing to the ongoing
[stalemate](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202107/t20210726_9134602.html)]{.underline}**.
Discussions with high-level Chinese scholars and former government
officials have revealed that Beijing prefers to define the bilateral
relationship as a peaceful coexistence guided by shared principles,
consensus, and possible cooperation. **[China is frustrated that the
United States is more focused on competing with and confronting
Beijing]{.underline}**. In Washington, however, great power rivalry,
defined more by competition and confrontation than cooperation, has
become the central framework for bilateral ties. HOW HAVE THESE
DIFFERING VIEWS AFFECTED POLICYMAKING? The pronounced turn in U.S.
policy toward China, beginning with the Trump administration, has not
led to self-reflection on the part of Beijing. Chinese scholars and
experts initially appeared somewhat
[surprised](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/world/asia/china-trade-war-trump.html)
that many of the economic, security, and technology policies that
Beijing has pursued for years have recently precipitated robust policy
responses from the United States. The ruling party believes that it is
merely continuing down the same path it established some years back,
which has led to its attributing the downturn in the bilateral
relationship solely to the United States. **[Chinese government
officials appear to believe the United States' goal is to
"[suppress](https://news.cgtn.com/news/3245444e77554464776c6d636a4e6e62684a4856/index.html)"

and the Quad's [increasing
coordination](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/11/975469203/quad-summit-biden-looks-to-boost-coordination-against-china),
as evidence of Washington's desire to
[contain](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202201/1246562.shtml) China
and limit Beijing's influence in the Indo-Pacific. Moreover, **[many
Chinese scholars and experts view U.S. restrictions on sensitive
technology exports to China as
[proof](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3164367/china-must-brace-digital-cold-war-us-battle-tech-supremacy)
that the United States seeks to hamper its burgeoning tech
sector.]{.underline}** Finally, they
[see](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202104/1220502.shtml)U.S.
complaints about human rights violations in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and
Tibet as disingenuous, given the United States' own problems with racial
justice and homelessness, as well as its high levels of wealth and
income inequality. In short, China sees the United States as a declining
power that is attempting to keep a rising China from overtaking it. The
United States, as expected, has a very different view of bilateral
dynamics. Washington blames the downturn in relations on China's
increasing assertiveness abroad and repressiveness at home. U.S.
officials are concerned that China, through its support of authoritarian
regimes, is chipping away at the liberal international order and trying
to create "[a world safe for
autocracy](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-06-11/world-safe-autocracy)";
that its continued military modernization and interest in building bases
in
[Cambodia](https://amti.csis.org/changes-underway-at-cambodias-ream-naval-base/),

Guinea](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-seeks-first-military-base-on-africas-atlantic-coast-u-s-intelligence-finds-11638726327),
and the [United Arab
Emirates](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=dubai+chinese+military+bas)
will allow Beijing to challenge Washington's security primacy; and that
its state capitalist, mercantilist system threatens the rules-based
economic order. Beijing's incarceration of around [1 million Uighurs and
other Muslim
minorities](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-repression-uyghurs-xinjiang)
in Xinjiang, increasingly strict online censorship, and prosecution of
dissidents have further fueled Washington's desire to enact more
aggressive responses. WHAT DOES EACH SIDE WANT OUT OF THE RELATIONSHIP?
Our conversations have revealed that China wants the United States to
afford it the space it believes it deserves as a rising power, at least
in its own backyard. Beijing, as the preeminent Asian security and
economic actor, sees the United States' military presence in East and
Southeast Asia as inherently threatening. Moreover, it hopes that
Washington will ease pressure, especially regarding economics and
technology, as well as refrain from engaging in ideological competition
in service of impugning Beijing's governance model and human rights
record. But perhaps China's most significant wish is for the United
States to acknowledge the legitimacy of its economic and political
systems. Given that the United States views China's economic and
political practices as antithetical to its own, as well as to those of
countries acting within a healthy, properly functioning international
system, Washington is unlikely to refrain from impeaching Chinese
authoritarianism, mercantilism, and treatment of ethnic minorities and
dissidents. The United States' tougher policies and more confrontational
approach are meant to push back on and defend against a range of Chinese
domestic and foreign practices that threaten to undermine the
international rules and norms that have been in place since the end of
World War II, as well as raise the costs for China to revise that very
order. In general, Washington would prefer that Beijing dial back or
eliminate its economic and innovation mercantilism, respect other
countries' sovereignties, agree to peacefully resolve disputes, and
abide by international agreements on human rights. HOW CAN THE TWO SIDES
RECONCILE THEIR DIFFERENCES? Biden has opted to use a calmer, more
restrained tone with Beijing than did his predecessor, with the aim of
avoiding escalation. Moreover, unlike some Trump administration
[officials](https://www.wsj.com/articles/secretary-of-state-pompeo-to-urge-chinese-people-to-change-the-communist-party-11595517729),
Biden's team has made it clear that Washington is not seeking regime
change in China. And though Biden
[criticized](https://www.cfr.org/election2020/candidate-tracker) Trump's
lack of a clear set of goals or a coherent interagency policy framework
for addressing the China challenge, his administration has yet to
release its long-awaited [China
strategy](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-01-14/washingtons-missing-china-strategy)
(though China does figure prominently in its recently issued
[Indo-Pacific
Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/U.S.-Indo-Pacific-Strategy.pdf)).
Until that document is issued, the finer points of the administration's
plans to compete with Beijing, as well as the end goal of such
competition, will remain fuzzy. A clear articulation of U.S. aims would
be helpful in Washington's efforts to secure greater international
cooperation from allies and partners in addressing the challenges China
poses. It would also provide Chinese and U.S. leaders a starting point
from which to negotiate the future of bilateral ties. In China, there is
considerable room for greater self-reflection. Chinese leaders should
closely examine how Beijing's own aggressive diplomacy, economic
statecraft, military buildup, and human rights violations have alarmed
and unsettled the United States and many other countries, especially
those in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Across many conversations,
few, if any, Chinese experts have acknowledged that Beijing's actions
have played a role in the cratering of U.S.-China relations.
Furthermore, they are reluctant to acknowledge that numerous nations'
hardening stances toward China are driven by China's activities rather
than U.S. coercion. Acknowledging its agency in harming relations, as
well as its ability to take proactive steps to put U.S.-China ties on
better footing, would constitute important initial gestures by the
Chinese side. Moreover, China's willingness to take more responsibility
for its own actions and modify its policy and rhetoric would go a long
way toward stabilizing bilateral dynamics. There is no doubt the
U.S.-China relationship will remain competitive going forward.
Preventing bilateral ties from becoming even more hostile and
adversarial, however, should constitute a common aim for both countries.
Biden understands this, as he stressed the importance of developing
guardrails and establishing strategic stability talks between the two
governments [during his virtual
summit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/16/readout-of-president-bidens-virtual-meeting-with-president-xi-jinping-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china/)
with Xi. Implementing robust crisis management mechanisms would also
prove a useful step in augmenting both nations' abilities to control
escalation in the event of a military incident in the increasingly
crowded waters and air space off of China's eastern and southern coasts.
Washington and Beijing also should establish an effective
problem-solving mode for the bilateral relationship. Many observers
stress the importance of U.S.-China cooperation on transnational issues
where the two sides have common interests---[climate
change](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/planetpolicy/2021/10/28/rebuilding-us-chinese-cooperation-on-climate-change-the-science-and-technology-opportunity/),
[nuclear
nonproliferation](https://www.brookings.edu/research/revitalizing-nonproliferation-cooperation-with-russia-and-china/),
and [global
health](https://www.csis.org/analysis/advancing-us-china-health-security-cooperation-era-strategic-competition),
among others. These efforts are certainly important, but they are quite
ambitious and often hampered by Washington's and Beijing's different
approaches to managing international issues. The two countries have thus
far failed to make progress in most areas. That does not mean they
should abandon these efforts. But perhaps the United States and China
should devote more energy toward trying to create a problem-solving
approach for addressing more pointed irritants, such as limits on
journalist visas and consulate closures. Such a method has already
yielded dividends regarding the [former
issue](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/16/us/politics/us-china-journalists.html).
The two countries should focus on how to build on those smaller
successes to work through larger problems in other areas. By committing
to this pragmatic approach, the United States and China may be able to
find a way to put a floor under deteriorating relations, begin to build
goodwill, and lay the foundation for taking on the larger structural
issues in areas, like trade and technology, that will be key to
determining the future health and welfare of the U.S.-China relationship
over the long term. Despite the two nations' differing mindsets and
approaches to bilateral ties, starting small could prove the best method
through which to, eventually, realize large gains.

### 2AC -- US Says no

#### US says no -- it can't afford to ban Russia from SWIFT -- economy shock spills over into the US AND sanctions [incite]{.underline} dedollarization

"[We in Germany are prepared to pay a high price economically --- that's
why everything is on the table]{.underline}," German Foreign Minister
Annalena Baerbock said on Friday.

"[These are [some of the]{.mark} [greatest sanctions]{.mark}, if not the
**[strongest]{.mark} that [we've ever issued]{.mark}**]{.underline},"
Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated at the Munich Security
Conference over the weekend. "[It is [directed at institutions]{.mark}
--- in particular, financial institutions --- and individuals, and it
[will **exact**]{.mark} **absolute [harm for the Russian
economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

[Yet for all the aggressive posturing, the **[U.S.]{.mark} coalition has
seemingly [backtracked on SWIFT]{.mark}**, [deciding not to
block]{.mark} [Russian access]{.mark} to the international payments
communication system]{.underline}. Pundits have come to refer to
**[[SWIFT sanctions]{.mark} as "[the nuclear
option]{.mark}]{.underline}**." But some policy experts say this
characterization is wildly overstated, arguing instead that [SWIFT
sanctions wouldn't be nearly as effective as those directly targeting
Russian banks.]{.underline}

[So why are sanctions against Russian banks still on the table, **while
[cutting off SWIFT]{.mark} access has been [deemed a step too
far]{.mark}**?]{.underline} There's a **[simple answer]{.underline}**:
[[Removing Russian access]{.mark} would **[constitute]{.mark} an
[economic shock]{.mark}** that U.S. [politicians and
corporations]{.mark} would **[rather not
instigate]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[There's a more complicated [and]{.mark} consequential explanation,
however, that has to do with [anxiety over]{.mark} the U.S. [dollar's
status as global reserve currency]{.mark}. SWIFT [sanctions]{.mark},
rather than being a "nuclear option" thwarting Russia, **[could]{.mark}
be the first [domino]{.mark} in a sequence of [events that bolster
China- and Russia]{.mark}-backed [alternative]{.mark} digital [payment
systems]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Such sanctions might also, in the long
run, steer emerging markets toward blockchain-based systems that would
reduce global reliance on the U.S.-centric international monetary
system. Altogether, [SWIFT sanctions could very well **[incite]{.mark}
the [dedollarization of the world economy]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[Over 11,000 financial institutions spread across more than 200
countries use SWIFT to communicate payments and securities

of banks and headquartered in Belgium, likely in part to convey the
"strict neutrality" that SWIFT purports to uphold.

[But the vast majority of [SWIFT transactions]{.mark} are settled [in
U.S. dollars]{.mark}, which helps solidify the currency's status as the
global reserve currency]{.underline}. This [[gives]{.mark} the U.S.

national debt that now exceeds \$30 trillion and exert influence over
foreign nations through punitive monetary policy. [Despite the supposed
neutrality of SWIFT, the U.S. wielded its influence to boot Iran from

### 2AC -- Doesn't Deter Russia

#### Sanctions don't deter russia -- status quo proves

Abigail **Ng 22** \[Abigail Ng, 3-11-22, "Relying on sanctions to stop
Russia could go 'terribly wrong,' says Niall Ferguson," CNBC,
https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/11/waiting-for-sanctions-to-stop-russia-could-go-terribly-wrong-niall-ferguson.html,
smarx, HHW\]

The strategy of sitting back and waiting for Russia's war machine to
grind to a halt because of sanctions could go "terribly wrong,"
according to Niall Ferguson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution
at Stanford University.

"It's a highly risky strategy," he said.

The Ukrainian resistance cannot hold the fort for much longer, and
sanctions by the West won't be able to stop Russia in time, he told
CNBC's "Squawk Box Asia" on Friday.

He said the U.S. is relying heavily on sanctions and "very belated arms
deliveries" to Ukraine, but he's concerned that those fighting for
Ukraine won't be able to defend the country for long.

Though the Russians have sustained more casualties than expected, they
are still "advancing steadily," he said.

"The assumption that this is going to drag out, that the United States
can sit back and watch the economic sanctions do their work may be
gravely mistaken," Ferguson said.

Anna Ohanyan of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP)
echoed that sentiment.

"While the sanctions will start biting --- perhaps can change Putin's
behavior down the road --- at this point, they cannot be relied on as an
instrument to be used to stop the violence," said Ohanyan, a nonresident
senior scholar in CEIP's Russia and Eurasia program.

"It won't work fast enough to avert a Russian victory in Ukraine and I
think this is the critical problem," Ferguson said.

'Nightmare scenario'

The U.S. and its allies have imposed wide-ranging sanctions on Russia
for its invasion of Ukraine. But it appears that there's a race between
Russia's military advancements and the sanctions that are crippling
Moscow.

"There's no guarantee that Ukraine holds out, and what I dread is
steadily worse news from Ukraine, and the breakdown of Ukraine's
defenses," Ferguson said.

"We'll sit there saying, oh, well the sanctions have really hurt Russia
--- but it won't matter to Putin because he will be able to claim
victory. That for me is the nightmare scenario," he added.

Ferguson said the U.S. should help support Ukraine's defenses without
escalating it into a full-blown NATO-Russia war.

Arms deliveries to Ukraine slowed down previously, and now there is a
"frantic effort" to help Ukraine keep up the fight, he said.

That, however, may create the conditions of a proxy war, CEIP's Ohanyan
said.

"It appears that unfortunately, \[at\] this point, sanctions and the
military assistance work at cross purposes," she said.

## AT: BWC CP

### Solvency Deficits

#### There are too many problems with the BWC for it to solve -- funding, cooperation, and more are issues that it is dealing with right now

Kathryn **Millett**., 06-01-**17**, \"Financial Woes Spell Trouble for
the Biological Weapons Convention,\" Health Security,
https://www-liebertpub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1089/hs.2017.0030

[Strong stewardship is critical to the enduring health and strength of
international disarmament treaties and the norms they
uphold]{.underline}. Such stewardship involves significant investment of
both political will and financial capital. [Currently, the Biological
and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC)---a cornerstone of the web of
international efforts to ensure and protect global health
security---seems to have neither, and the ramifications are
significant.]{.underline} In November 2016, states parties to the BWC
gathered together for the 5-year review of the operation of the
convention. Such review conferences are opportunities to assess the
health of the treaty and take decisions and recommendations to further
strengthen its effectiveness and improve its implementation. Key issues
requiring urgent action by states parties in 2016 included the
modalities of cooperation and assistance efforts in responding to
deliberate disease events, enhanced reassurance on treaty compliance,
and a regular scientific and technological review process to ensure the
treaty keeps pace with the rapid developments in the life sciences.
[Despite considerable preparatory effort by states parties, the review
conference failed to reach consensus on any substantive issues or agree
an intersessional work program. The sole outcome of over a year\'s hard
work was agreement that the treaty would continue to function as before,
while a Meeting of States Parties (MSP) would be held in December 2017
that would "seek to make progress on issues of substance and process for
the period before the next Review Conference, with a view to reaching
consensus on an intersessional process."]{.underline} While the majority
of attention focused on efforts to reach consensus on substantive
issues---and the continuing disappointment of the failure to do
so---another issue rumbled largely ignored in the background. Just prior
to the review conference---and for the first time in the treaty\'s
history---the BWC Implementation Support Unit (ISU) distributed a
document prepared by the Financial Resources Management Service (FRMS)
of the United Nations Office at Geneva detailing the status of states
parties\' financial contributions to the convention. This document
demonstrated that 62% of states parties owed a combined total of
US\$596,519 to the treaty over the period 2001 to 2016 in unpaid
assessed contributions. Concurrently, a number of presentations by the
UN FRMS made during the review conference explicitly spelled out the
consequences to states parties of the roll-out of the UN enterprise
resource planning system, dubbed "Umoja": under UN financial procedures,
funds must be available before staff contracts can be renewed and
meetings held; if there are insufficient funds, meetings cannot be
convened and staff cannot be recruited or have their contracts renewed.
Umoja does not permit crossing budget lines to make up shortfalls in
other areas. In the run-up to a meeting, a review process will take
place where a go/no-go decision will be taken 3 months ahead of the
proposed meeting dates based on funding. While the implementation of the
financial rules are causing havoc across a number of disarmament
treaties (eg, the 5th Review Conference of the Convention on Certain
Conventional Weapons \[CCW\] was almost brought to a screeching halt in
2016, and all remaining scheduled meetings for 2017 are facing
cancellation), these rules possess a greater significance for the BWC
ISU than other similar treaty support agencies: Since the ISU is merely
hosted by the UN and is not itself a UN body, it cannot draw on the
regular budget of the UN and is thus dependent solely on the annual
assessed contributions of its states parties. The ISU\'s financial
instability is further compounded by the fact that its current funding
arrangements do not permit recruitment of temporary staff to cover gaps
in the ISU due to maternity leave or illness. Amid this new focus on
finances came an extraordinary move from the BWC depository states (the
Russian Federation, the United States, and the United Kingdom). In March
2017, the BWC depository states called on all states parties to pay
their assessed financial contributions to the treaty and settle their
arrears "without further delay," warning that failure to do so could
result in staff losses in the BWC ISU and cancellation of the
forthcoming meeting of states parties in December. While a number of
states responded rapidly to this urgent call and consequently enabled
renewal of ISU staff contracts, as of the latest FRMS report of April
31, 2017, there remains --\$473,195 in outstanding contributions shared
by 114 (or 64% of) states parties covering the years 2001 to 2017. While
a significant proportion of arrears reflects late payments of assessed
contributions for the year 2017 (--\$141,195), 4 states have not paid
their assessed contributions since 2001 and another 8 have not paid any
contributions over the past 5 years. One state party alone owns 63% of
all debts owed to the BWC, accrued over the period 2001 to 2017.
[Conversely, several states have overpaid the BWC, the most notable
among them being the United States\'s overpayment of around a quarter of
a million dollars. However, the BWC still possesses a deficit of
--\$114,344: not enough to cover the meeting costs for
2017.]{.underline} With the planned 2017 meeting of states parties being
the sole forum for making any progress on agreement of a substantive
intersessional work program prior to the next review conference
scheduled for 2021, it is of the utmost importance that states parties
dig deep and make sure that there are sufficient funds to allow the
meeting to be held. [Of equal importance are measures to ensure
financial sustainability of the convention and the ISU. There are a
number of financial solutions that have been adopted by similar treaties
and agencies that could be adapted to suit the needs of the
BWC]{.underline}. For example, the Organisation for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons (OPCW) maintains a working capital fund that it uses to
cover temporary financial shortcomings, while the International Atomic
Energy Agency\'s (IAEA) Peaceful Uses Initiative solicits extrabudgetary
contributions that supplement its other funds when the need arises. Both
funds ensure that the agencies possess the financial flexibility to
quickly respond to financial shortages, requests for additional
activities by states parties, and any unexpected needs or unforeseen
emergency events. Another option would be to consider the establishment
of a voluntary revolving capital fund as adopted in January 2015 by the
United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR). UNIDIR\'s
"stability fund" has a \$1 million goal for which 1-time donations are
received from participating states on a rotating annual basis, ensuring
that the fund is replenished each year. [Extrabudgetary funding for the
BWC is not new. The ISU has often received voluntary contributions from
states parties in a position to do so, but these contributions are
usually given on a project-by-project basis to fund the convening of a
certain meeting or similar activity. The most significant of these
contributions is from the European Council, which has supported the BWC
through the adoption of 2 council decisions and which provides financial
contributions to UNODA for activities in support of the
BWC,]{.underline} including costs for 2 UNODA staff to carry out
activities mandated by the decisions. Further, the BWC administers a
sponsorship program funded by voluntary contributions from states that
enable participants from developing countries to attend BWC meetings.
The creation of a voluntary and non-earmarked fund that the ISU could
employ as needed to cover any shortfalls in meeting and staffing costs
would provide the BWC with the flexibility needed to cover urgent costs
that cannot be achieved under Umoja rules. Further, by channeling
overpayments by states parties into a central reserve, the ongoing
unpaid arrears of recalcitrant states would no longer be masked by any
overpayments and more pressure could be brought to bear on them to
resolve their debts in a timely fashion. But any such monies would need
to be held outside the Umoja system, which may not be possible. The
above options could also be supported by the adoption of sanctions
against states in arrears that would deny voting or participatory rights
to states until their debts are settled or an appropriate reduction in
arrears has been effected. Such a system has long been in use by the UN.
Under Article 19 of the Charter, a UN member state in arrears of an
amount that equals or exceeds the contributions due for 2 preceding
years can lose its vote in the general assembly. An exception is
permitted if the member state can show that conditions beyond its
control contributed to its inability to pay. As recently as May 2, 2017,
the UN invoked Article 19 to withdraw Libya\'s voting rights in the
general assembly until such time as it has made the necessary payments
to reduce its arrears below the specified amount. The OPCW has the
option to invoke a similar procedure under rule 35 of the rules of
procedure of the executive council. [However, financial woes are not the
only issue to plague the BWC. States parties have consistently shown a
lack of the necessary political will to strengthen the BWC.
Participation in BWC meetings has historically been low when compared
with other disarmament treaties, and states have regularly failed to
overcome political differences and point-scoring to agree on necessary
measures to strengthen implementation of the treaty. In fact, the
planned 2017 MSP has yet to appoint a chair, meaning that critical
preparations and discussions prior to the meeting cannot be
undertaken.]{.underline} Measures instigated by states parties such as
the cooperation and assistance database remain woefully under-used by
both states offering assistance and those seeking assistance, and the
request from the Seventh Review Conference in 2011 for "States Parties
to provide at least biannually appropriate information on how they
implement Article X of the Convention to the ISU" saw submissions from
just 10 states parties, 1 regional organization, and 1 group of states
during the intersessional period of 2012 to 2015. Perhaps the most
obvious evidence of a general lack of political will or interest in the
BWC can be found in the level of annual confidence-building measures
(CBM) returns. Despite a number of programs and efforts to enhance
participation, the number of confidence-building measures returns per
year has never risen above 45% of states parties. In fact, a third of
states parties have never submitted a return, and, when returns are
submitted, the quality of the information provided is often sorely
lacking. This is particularly significant in the BWC context as the
confidence-building measures represent the sole means by which states
parties more formally provide reassurance of compliance with the
provisions and obligations of the BWC. All across the disarmament
sphere[, treaties are under financial pressure. The continued use and
threats of use of conventional and nonconventional weapons by states and
non-state actors puts international weapons norms at risk.]{.underline}
States parties must act to positively reinforce the norms against the
use of banned weapons. Upholding the life-saving norms enshrined in
international disarmament treaties is a difficult and costly
business---one that requires considerable political commitment and
financial investment. [When states fail to invest in ensuring that
treaties remain strong and well-resourced, it is humanity that
ultimately pays the price. If BWC states parties truly value the norms
against the use of biology as a weapon, they need to demonstrate this by
putting their money where their mouth is.]{.underline}

In 1990, the U.S. political and military leadership was significantly
challenged by the possibility that Iraq, having the fourth largest
offensive chemical and biological weapons program in the world at the
time, might use those unconventional weapons against U.S. forces and its
allies massing in Saudi Arabia. For all practical purposes, there was no
real capability to rapidly detect and identify the deliberate release of
anthrax spores or other biological weapons, and the U.S. military did
not have sufficient vaccines or therapeutics for such an event. Due to
this severe neglect to biological defense, former Secretary of State
James Baker gave a formal letter to the Iraqi foreign minister stating
that Iraq would "pay a terrible price" if it used chemical or biological
weapons against the U.S.-led coalition.1 Had Saddam Hussein decided to
use biological weapons, it could have caused thousands of casualties.
Fortunately for U.S. forces, he did not have a significant biological
weapons capability and there was no use of those weapons. Despite dark
predictions of both nation-states and violent extremist organizations
planning biological attacks against the nation, there has been no test
of the U.S. military's biodefense capability. A "biological taboo"
resulting from decades of arms control discussions has held, despite the
lack of a verification regime behind the Biological Weapons Convention
(BWC).2 Concerns about Iraq's biological weapons capability in 2003
evaporated a year later, with nothing substantive to find. Despite
concerns about a domestic terrorist biological incident following the
anthrax attacks in 2001, there has never been a mass casualty attack
caused by biological organisms in the United States since then. [The
Nation's recent public health challenges in addressing the 2019
coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) have caused questions as to whether the
U.S. military is sufficiently prepared for an **adversary that might be
emboldened to use biological weapons against U.S. national security
interests**.]{.underline} Despite the lack of any biological attacks or
even threat of attacks over the past twenty years, [the potential impact
of a large-scale use of a contagious disease concerns enough people to
call for new national strategies and improved response capabilities for
biological threats.]{.underline} Current strategies aim to mitigate
natural disease, to regulate biological research associated with the
more hazardous biological diseases, and to improve the U.S. public
health system to better respond to biological threats.3 Yet despite the
development of four national strategies for national biodefense over the
past twenty years, the U.S. government has not significantly advanced
its capabilities for protecting against and responding to biological
threats, defined as including natural diseases, deliberate biological
releases, and laboratory accidents[. Despite the high-level attention to
this threat, assessments of the Nation's capability to prepare for
deliberate biological threats have **not, however, been
positive**.]{.underline} [Unclassified assessments from the State
Department and the Department of Defense (DOD) suggest **that China and
Russia** could have a **biological weapons** capability, as could North
Korea and Iran.]{.underline}4 The lack of any actual use of biological
weapons against the United States has perhaps diminished the concern
that potential weaknesses exist. [In the event of a future conflict with
great powers, there is the chance that biological warfare could emerge
as a significant threat, perhaps in a form unrecognized from Cold War
experiences.]{.underline} Prior to attempting the implementation of yet
another strategy to counter biological threats[, the Army needs to
establish the context of how adversaries would deliberately use
biological threats against U.S. national security interests. Once a
rational appreciation of the threat is developed, one can then create a
defense strategy that directly addresses deliberate biological releases.
Importantly, such a strategy needs to be resourced and implemented to
address the future challenges of a deliberate biological release,
understanding that natural infectious diseases pose a competing
priority.]{.underline} Counter to the hypothesis that the pandemic
outbreak has revealed potential vulnerabilities to biological weapons,
COVID-19 has not in fact acted like a biological weapon. As a result,
the lessons that apply from this contemporary crisis toward a biological
weapons attack are few. A pandemic outbreak, affecting the general
population over a year's time, requires a different approach than
military forces protecting themselves from a focused deliberate
biological attack. COVID-19 is not lethal enough and does not
incapacitate people quickly enough to qualify as a potential weapon,
despite the more than 750,000 deaths caused over twenty-four months
across the United States.5 A biological disease that does not
significantly impact young, healthy people and that is easily countered
by a national vaccine program is not prime material for a weapon system.
COVID-19 may have slowed down economic activities, but it is not an
existential threat to the U.S. government. Despite the potential impact
on national security, pandemic diseases are best addressed separately
from biological defense concepts. The U.S. military does anticipate the
potential use of biological weapons in combat operations. In that light,
the Department of Defense has a counter-weapons of mass destruction
(WMD) strategy and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear
(CBRN) defense concept to guide its efforts to prevent, protect against,
and respond to adversaries using biological weapons.6 The ratification
of the BWC has significantly reduced the number of potential adversaries
that might use traditional biological warfare (BW) agents, allowing one
to focus on particular actors and military scenarios. The traditional
biological warfare agents such as anthrax, pneumatic plague, smallpox,
and tularemia are still potent candidates for future warfare. However,
[the employment of said weapons may look very different than envisioned
during the Cold War.]{.underline} North Korea may be the exception to
this statement, as it is unclear how that nation would use
unconventional weapons, but its operational concept for warfare appears
to be based in an industrial age, massed firepower approach, similar to
what NATO might have anticipated in the 1970s.[7 China and Iran are
assessed as not complying with the BWC, and **Russia and North Korea are
believed to have retained offensive biological weapons programs**.8
While we can understand the biological warfare model that North Korea
might employ, this does not necessarily apply to Russia's and China's
concepts of employment for biological weapons.]{.underline} The Cold War
model of using massive amounts of biological agents against troop
concentrations, major population centers, and large military sites such
as air bases and seaports requires large-scale production, storage, and
testing capability. As Russia and China have modernized their nuclear
and conventional forces, they have also changed their approach toward
military confrontations with the United States and partner nations.
While preparing for the possibility of total war, both countries have
focused on conducting regional operations against U.S. allies using
methods that fall below the threshold of open conflict.9 Their nuclear
arsenals cast a coercive shadow over regional operations that allow
those nations to aggressively push and attain their political
objectives. [As a result, a clandestine biological weapons program can
offer them a capability to perform single, small-scale chemical or
biological weapons attacks on focused targets (facilities or
individuals) while claiming to be compliant with the BWC]{.underline}.10
The former Soviet Union had a massive biological warfare program,
unmatched by any historical measure. Despite extensive documentation of
this program, the Russian Federation has not fully acknowledged the
former Soviet Union BW program. [The State Department has gone so far as
to designate specific Russian government facilities as "acting contrary
to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United
States" through their association as military defense facilities
associated with a BW research program.11 These are not recent concerns.
Analysts will point out that]{.underline} in 2012, then Prime Minister
[Vladimir Putin talked about creating "weapon systems that use different
physical principles ... (beam, geophysical, wave, genetic,
psychophysical and other types of weapons)."]{.underline}12 However, it
is unclear that this attributed quote referred to a return to developing
biological weapons to support military conflict[. In 2019, Putin
directed a budget of 220 billion rubles (or \$3.3 billion) toward the
development of genetic technologies that could support a wide range of
applications (biomedical, agricultural, or biodefense).13 At the same
time, the Russian government has claimed that the United States is
building offensive BW laboratories in countries surrounding Russia
through the Biological Threat Reduction Program.]{.underline} For
instance, the "Lugar Center for Public Health Research" in Tbilisi,
Georgia, was funded by U.S. defense funds, but its intent is to promote
health security against natural infectious disease outbreaks.14 In
response to U.S. government accusations of China's role in the COVID-19
outbreak, Chinese government officials have recently echoed the same
claims that the U.S. government has created biological weapons near
their borders.15 This type of disinformation campaign falls squarely in
the "gray zone" set of tools[. Both China and Russia **have ignored**
international efforts to prevent the proliferation of unconventional
weapons technology and materials]{.underline}. China's position as one
of the leaders of the global bioeconomy increases its potential for
realized or latent advanced biological warfare capabilities. Beijing
appears committed to becoming a leader in biotechnology, which holds the
promise of myriad public health applications. Yet, many biotechnology
applications are dual-use, capable of delivering both public health
benefits and advances in biological warfare capabilities. As one top
U.S. expert noted, China "is pursuing a very aggressive strategy to
become the world leader in biotechnology."16 Sustained public and
private investment in synthetic biology technologies needed for DNA
sequencing and synthesis as well as gene editing have enabled China to
develop a wide array of dual-use biotechnologies in the field of
synthetic biology. Many experts anticipate that synthetic biology
advances will enable the development of "new and novel biomaterials" to
include advanced bioweapons.17 As a 2020 Brookings Institution study
noted, "[The determination of China's one-party state to become a
leading player in biotechnology is reflected by the rapid growth in
investment in the sector. Some estimates claim that collectively,
China's central, local, and provincial governments have invested over
\$100 billion in life sciences research and development."18 China's
sustained and sizeable government investment in domestic biotechnology
has created an industrial base capable of developing and manufacturing a
range of extant and novel biological warfare agents]{.underline}. And
[while the possibility of developing novel biological warfare agents is
present, it is more probable that China wants to use its biotechnology
lead to produce superior commercial pharmaceuticals and to enhance its
military forces. There is always speculation that advances in the life
sciences will drive an evolution in biological weapons, **making them
more lethal, more environmentally hardy, more targeted toward specific
populations**]{.underline}, or more able to confound contemporary
detection systems. This belief used to be rooted in the 1970s rise of
biotechnology, and then it was 1990s genetics driving the concerns.
Today, it is the promise (and dangers) of synthetic biology. And while
it is true that one could always improve characteristics of certain
biological weapons, there are significant drawbacks as to such an
approach.19 Assuming that an adversary might develop altered biological
weapons to be more operationally relevant, this would still be a
violation of treaty (if it were China or Russia) and international
norms. [Modifying a biological organism to enhance its resistance to
antibiotics might in turn reduce other desired characteristics, such as
its lethality or dissemination qualities. Any use of a genetically
modified organism would run the risk of direct attribution to a
particular source]{.underline}. Western military forces lack the
capability to detect the deliberate use of biological weapons until
after exposure. In addition, U.S. forces lack vaccines for a number of
traditional biological warfare agents, let alone engineered diseases.20
Any nation with an advanced industrial capability can easily develop
biological agents that can damage or destroy crops or livestock, in
addition to targeting humans. There is no need for an overly
sophisticated engineered biological warfare agent à la the latest James
Bond movie, No Time to Die. And even if military forces had tactical
biological detectors that could identify all biological warfare agents
in a timely enough fashion to put on protective masks, traditional
biological weapons would still be an effective strategic weapon against
a civilian populace, its livestock, or cropland. There is no possibility
that the United States and its Western allies can make biological
weapons obsolete.21 At the same time, we do not need to overexaggerate
the threat of biological weapons as some Hollywood scripts portray them.
There are several options that could be explored. The traditional
approach has been to develop chemical and biological defense as a
combined operational concept. Both chemical and biological warfare
agents use similar delivery systems and target the human body's
physiological response to hazards. Under the larger construct of
countering WMD threats, [the U.S. government can engage in arms control
negotiations to limit biological weapons use, use preemptive strikes to
target a nation's WMD capability, and respond to its use with protective
equipment that limits the impedance of combat operations. None of these
options are singular to biological threats.]{.underline} A second option
is to task the medical community to identify and respond to both
biological warfare attacks and natural disease outbreaks while limiting
reliance on biological detectors and technical experts. [The U.S. Air
Force, for instance, endorses a biological defense concept that is
separate from chemical defense and that relies on the medical community
for initial detection and identification.22 This is a very specific
focus on biological threats that includes a conscious decision to limit
investments in people and equipment in response to a lower probability
of deliberate biological attacks.]{.underline} The Air Force concept is
a subset of its counter WMD operations, as the Army's CBRN defense
efforts are. The U.S. Army recently released a biological defense
strategy that calls for the "synchronized implementation" of both
biological warfare defense and infectious natural diseases across the
Army.23 Interestingly, the office responsible for implementing this
strategy is the U.S. Army Nuclear and Countering Weapons of Mass
Destruction Agency, not the Army's chemical-biological defense
specialists and not the Army's medical experts who respectively own
those areas of expertise. It is not immediately clear as to whether this
strategy calls for the development of a stand-alone biological defense
concept that combines capabilities for both infectious natural diseases
and deliberate biological releases, or just a single agency that manages
two very different concepts (counter-WMD and force health protection)
that have a common scientific origin. The strategy details four "lines
of effort" that include developing and managing talent and facilities
that address biological threats; maintaining a biological common
operating picture and awareness of biological defense forensics;
building a readiness posture that includes protection, response, and
training for biological defense capabilities; and directing
modernization efforts for biological defense concepts and doctrine. Will
this new governance structure fundamentally change how the Army does
biological defense? Given policy and budget direction, probably not.
This is not the first time a military agency has suggested moving all
biodefense activities into a portfolio for medical countermeasures for
infectious diseases. There is an almost instinctual movement toward
putting medical experts in charge of developing capabilities for
countering all biological threats; however, that does not work for two
reasons. First, given a collection of biological threats---whether
natural, deliberate, or accidental---medical leaders will always
consider infectious natural diseases the most important concerns because
of the large numbers of service members and their dependents who get
sick from natural diseases. And there are a lot of infectious natural
diseases to address. In 1990, the U.S. military found itself without
adequate vaccines for anthrax and botulin toxin when it was preparing to
face an Iraqi military force that had an active chemical and biological
weapons program. This was due to a deliberate decision to deprioritize
research and development for biological warfare agents and focus instead
on countermeasures for natural diseases such as chikungunya virus and
diarrheal diseases. [Second, while the response to biological threats
has often had a common core, the prevention and protection against
biological threats certainly does not.]{.underline} While one can try to
deter adversaries from using biological weapons, Mother Nature cannot be
deterred. [Protecting military forces from biological weapons during
combat operations requires a completely different approach than
protecting a military base's population from natural diseases. This
requires a level of nuance to understand that a single biodefense
concept cannot protect fundamentally different populations with
different requirements and facing fundamentally different biological
threats.]{.underline} There is a reason why there are different budgets
and authorities for dealing with biological warfare agents, natural
biological diseases, and biological research laboratory accidents. The
primary purposes of any strategy document are to identify a specific
mission or program, to identify policy objectives that should drive
discrete programs, and to offer a plan to achieve those objectives. In
the military, this is called "ends, ways, and means." Ideally, a
strategy will also aid decision makers in moving resources toward those
goals that require funding to achieve those objectives. So, the problem
with a biological defense strategy that aims to address all biological
threats---whether at the Army, the DOD, or national level---is that
there are multiple agencies with budget elements who are already
directed to address specific biological threats. I will argue that at
least five biological threat sectors require consideration in any
biological defense strategy: disease prevention as a function of public
health, bioterrorism response as a function of homeland security,
military biodefense as a function as countering WMD, biosurety as a
function of laboratory practices, and biosecurity and biosafety as a
function of agricultural and food industries. None of these are new
security concerns. Each has a dedicated government agency that focuses
on a distinct threat using a congressionally approved budget. Because
each biological threat sector already has a lead agency and agenda to
pursue, the question comes as to what a centralized biological defense
strategy would change or impact the direction of federal government or
military biodefense programs. Public health efforts addressing
infectious biological diseases, to include aspects of disease prevention
in the military's force health protection program, have been around for
more than one hundred years. One of the challenges in the U.S. public
health program is that it is federalized, meaning that states and local
jurisdictions implement public health programs while the federal
government provides research and funding for specific purposes. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National
Institutes of Health represent the largest government agencies in this
area, putting tens of billions of dollars against infectious disease
research, surveillance, and response. [Within the military, the Army's
Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases has a research and
development program for infectious diseases to address potential
biological threats to service members in U.S. and overseas
theaters.]{.underline} Top threats include tuberculosis, measles,
influenza, pneumonia, and malaria. Bioterrorism response is a little
more nebulous, since we have not seen a terrorist group successfully use
a biological hazard to cause mass casualties in the United States since
1984. However, following the 2001 Amerithrax incidents, the concern that
they might has thrown a few billion dollars a year toward the Department
of Homeland Security and Department of Health and Human Services to
develop response plans for the possibility.24 [The DOD needs to consider
biological terrorism within its installation force protection plans, but
for the most part, it is not an integral part of that effort due to the
very low probability of such an incident. The DOD does have a massive
CBRN Response Enterprise that would assist states and cities in any
federal response to a biological terrorist incident.]{.underline} The
top (realistic) biological threats usually include salmonella, ricin,
botulinum toxin, sewage, and tainted body fluids. Military biodefense
has focused on protecting U.S. forces from biological warfare agents
developed by adversarial nation-states for the purpose of combat
operations. We have always envisioned biological weapons attacks as
large-area coverage, mass casualty events on the battlefield. Because of
technical challenges, military biodefense capabilities were largely
lacking during the 1991 Persian Gulf conflict, leading to a crash
program in the mid-1990s to develop biological detectors and medical
countermeasures for the services. Biological detection and vaccines were
more readily available in 2003 as U.S. forces prepared for possible
Iraqi biological weapons use. There is a central program office that
manages all DOD biological defense programs, receiving maybe a half
billion dollars a year for funding. Their top threats include anthrax,
pneumonic plague, smallpox, tularemia, and brucellosis. The DOD's
Biological Threat Reduction Program, which is more of an effort to
secure other nations' laboratories and hospitals than biodefense,
accounts for less than a \$300 million in annual funding over the past
decade.25 Biosurety addresses the security and safety of laboratory
research labs both across the United States and within the U.S.
military. Unlike traditional biodefense efforts, biosurety is more about
keeping biologicals safe from humans, as opposed to the other way
around. The threat includes both the possibility that a researcher on
the inside might deliberately or accidentally release a dangerous
biological organism, or that an outsider might try to break in and steal
them. There is also the danger of natural disasters or externally
derived accidents to consider. The U.S. Army has had biosurety failures
that resulted in CDC shutdowns at its Dugway Proving Ground (in 2015 due
to anthrax shipments) and Fort Detrick laboratories (in 2019 due to
unsafe laboratory practices). While the CDC has some oversight role for
a small set of select agents and toxins, in general, the CDC can only
provide suggestions on how the U.S. research and development community
should implement good business practices. This area is not well funded
(maybe \$500 million/year) or overseen from the federal level. The top
threats for biosurety are too varied for listing, but in general,
accidents are largely limited to individual researchers and not the
general community surrounding a biological research lab. Biosecurity and
biosafety challenges within the agricultural and food industries have
been of two parts. First, many facilities have significantly large
amounts of livestock or crops to protect against the introduction of any
foreign disease that might wipe out their livelihood. In addition,
foreign pests or animals could displace or eliminate native animals and
crops. Second, there is the challenge of regulating food products as
they are moved from the farm to the table, as the saying goes. Federal
regulations aim to ensure that agricultural products used in meal
production are both safe and accurately labeled. Both the Food and Drug
Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture have responsibilities
to oversee this area, in addition to the Customs and Border Patrol.
There is not a significant DOD equity in this area other than ensuring
that meals prepared for the field are safe and free of contamination.
Because Congress is very interested in ensuring that the public has safe
food and a variety of different foods, this area gets funded between \$3
billion and \$4 billion a year. Its biological threats of concern
include foot-and-mouth disease, swine flu, avian flu, wheat rust, and
invasive species such as Asian carp, zebra mussels, cane toads, and
brown marmorated stink bugs. This is just the tip of the challenge of
trying to address all biological threats---natural, deliberate, and
accidental---under one Army, DOD, or national strategy. There are more
complex discussions as to what would constitute a national
biosurveillance effort---surprisingly, this would not be solely focused
on infectious biological diseases to humans, but also include diseases
affecting animals and plants, as well as chemical or radiological
hazards to any biological organism. [There is the challenge of
addressing the impact of future technologies such as "gain-of-function"
and synthetic biology. Even after we identify all of the potential
issues that surround "biological threats,"]{.underline} [there is the
question of who ought to lead the effort.]{.underline} The public health
community claims that if it were better funded, it could address all
natural disease outbreaks as well as respond to biological terrorism.
[The national security community feels that it needs to have a larger
voice in this effort, given that these are foreign threats that impact
the armed forces and other U.S. national security interests. And given
the national security community's funding and ability to quickly form
new project offices, they could very well dominate the discussion, which
could result in different priorities than what the public health
community sees as important.]{.underline} Concluding Thoughts [The
military's primary concern should be on deliberate biological threats,
but there is no question that it has been distracted by COVID-19 and the
general topic of natural disease outbreaks.]{.underline} If the DOD's
Chemical-Biological Defense Program decides to move from working on
countermeasures to biological warfare agents and focus instead on
"threat-agnostic" systems that address all biological threats, the
military will not get necessary detectors, protective ensembles, medical
vaccines, or decontaminants for biological warfare agents due to the
larger number and greater impact of natural infectious diseases. This
is, in essence, what happened in the 1980s; because the military medical
community was focused on research and development for infectious
diseases and not biological warfare agents, U.S. forces were unprepared
for biological warfare in 1990.26 [Military concepts of future war
assure us that biological and nuclear warfare are expected threats to
U.S. forces.27 In the case of a conflict with North Korea, it may not
look that different than Cold War concepts of massive, large-coverage
attacks on U.S. military bases. In the case of China and Russia**, it is
less clear what the future of biological war will be**. As technology
such as drone swarms, artificial intelligence, and synthetic biology
continue to mature, the shape of **biological warfare threats will
evolve**.]{.underline} One can assume that the traditional biological
warfare agents will still be viable candidates, or possibly enhancements
on their natural forms. Terrorist use of biological hazards may be
limited to crude toxins and improvised delivery systems---still a threat
to installation force protection measures, but not necessarily a mass
casualty event. [This future operating environment requires us to focus
on enhancing the survivability of critical infrastructure---in
particular, command and control, power projection, and logistics
bases---and the resiliency of military operations while impacted by
biological weapons]{.underline}. [The only way to succeed in moving
forward in a future biological defense posture is not, then, to dilute
the Army's efforts by trying to manage the development of defensive
capabilities for all natural disease outbreaks and deliberate biological
attacks under a single general construct. There needs to be a
laser-sharp focus on both pandemic preparedness and biological defense
during combat operations.]{.underline} In addition, the DOD needs to
ensure that its biological research and development laboratories have
the best practices in place to avoid future shutdowns due to biosurety
challenges. This is not an either/or discussion nor is it the time to
radically revise how military forces accomplish biological defense.
Instead, [Army leaders need to **engage** in these discussions, despite
the complicated technical nature of the topic, and ensure that future
operations can be maintained despite the threat of biological weapons
use]{.underline}.

### AT: Bioterrorism

#### Bioterrorism is just myths -- analysis proves. And there is no impact.

G. **Greub**, 6-1-20**14**, \[(Institute of Microbiology, University of
Lausanne and University Hospital Centre, Lausanne, Switzerland and 2)
Department of Infectious Diseases, Centre for Tropical Medicine and
Travel Medicine, Division of Internal Medicine, Academic Medical Centre,
University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) \"Bioterrorism:

Interestingly, although there are no doubt many features that
distinguish the two topics, [the public's perception of bioterrorism, in
its broad sense, shares some striking features with the human interest
in viral haemorrhagic fevers, as seen during the recent ebolavirus
disease outbreak in Guinea]{.underline} \[1\]. Although the [overall
risk of disease propagation and spread beyond the immediately involved
patients is limited, interest in these phenomena rises to an almost
hysterical level during an outbreak situation, and then collapses as
quickly as it built up immediately after the worst seems to be
over.]{.underline} No matter how far away the outbreak may be, and how
remote the risk of spread is, some features (the agent striking
apparently out of the blue, and then 'disappearing' again; the disease
being gruesome and killing cruelly, at least in the beginning of an
outbreak) make the waxing and waning public response, often tinged with
sensationalism, a characteristic feature accompanying viral haemorrhagic
fever outbreaks that is not dissimilar to the reaction towards perceived
or real bioweapon threats. In this CMI theme issue, we attempt to answer
the important question of whether bioterrorism is a myth or reality,
which is of relevance for clinical microbiologists, hospital hygiene
specialists, infectious diseases clinicians, basic researchers, defence
specialists, and public health policy-makers. In this issue, we also
decided to address several key questions, listed in Table 1, with the
input of biosafety officers and bioterrorism specialists from three
different countries. We aimed at providing a concise overview on key
facts and current points of discussion, rather than providing an
exhaustive textbook-like inventory and bibliography. Consequently, we
are confident that this compilation of articles constitutes a highly
informative and also gripping read. In the first article, by Jansen et
al. \[2\], [the definitions of biological warfare, biocrime and
bioterrorism are provided, clearly separating terrorist from criminal
use of biological agents. Jansen et al. also provide a very precise and
exhaustive list of biological agents that have been involved in
bioterrorism events, and that may serve as a basis for assessing the
real threat, and thus pitching the level of awareness and preparedness
of the various stakeholders at the most appropriate level.]{.underline}
In addition, this article provides some information for infectious
disease specialists, including the main clinical syndromes, incubation
times, mortality rates and treatment options for all listed
'bioterrorism agents'. Moreover, this article highlights the fact that,
in the 20th century, only ten events were recorded during the first 70
years, whereas 17 and 153 events were recorded from 1970 to 1989 and
from 1990 to 1999, respectively. This raised another question: does the
higher number of events registered more recently reflect the reality, or
is it only the result of a strong reporting bias? If this the case, we
may wonder why, when and how our perception has become biased. To answer
the latter question, Barras and Greub \[3\] performed a detailed
historical analysis of reported events from ancient times through to the
21st century. [Although there is no doubt that, on several occasions,
biological agents have been used to cause panic and terror among civil
populations, their true frequency of use and impact remain very
difficult to appreciate, because: (i) data are largely lacking from
before the Pasteurian microbiology era; (ii) reality was often hidden
and manipulated by politicians, as the 'truth' about biological attacks
may not be openly disseminated, given its intrinsically non-ethical
nature, and because information may be classified as secret by the
authorities, as it may be considered to be sensitive;]{.underline} and
(iii) the passage of time adds an additional layer of complexity, by
distorting facts. Thus, although illustrations such as the one provided
on the cover of this special issue may suggest the dissemination of
plague by the use of infected arrows, such illustrations may also simply
represent an allegory of the contagiousness of Yersinia pestis. The
detailed historical analysis conducted by the authors includes the
contemporary period, which is a period dominated, in terms of
bioterrorism, by the anthrax letters attack, which resulted in at least
45 infections requiring hospitalization. The importance of the anthrax
letters attack led most clinical microbiology laboratories to develop
diagnostic approaches for the detection of Bacillus anthracis. As
outlined by Jaton and Greub \[4\], the level of preparedness
progressively increased, although most initial procedures were simply
based on the procedures used for suspected haemorrhagic fever. However,
as shown in Table 2, [there are major differences between a suspected
bioterrorism attack and the detection of a naturally infected
haemorrhagic fever case that should be taken into account. Also
important is the fact that most clinical microbiology laboratories
progressively decrease their preparedness when the threat decreases.
Therefore, in order to reduce the risk of not being adequately prepared,
it is important to have regular exercises using true quality
controls]{.underline} (Fig. 1) [or using plasmid-based positive
controls, as using 'real' biosafety level 3 agents may be difficult,
owing to their association with significant biological risks.
Finally,]{.underline} Wurtz et al. \[5\] highlight the [problems that
inevitably arise from the strict legislation aimed at making unlawful
access to and experimentation with potential bioweapon agents
impossible. The unwanted adverse effect is that well-intended, and much
needed, research for the 'right' reasons has also become difficult, if
not completely unfeasible, in some respects.]{.underline} The article of
Wurtz et al. will stimulate fresh debate on how best to strike the
balance between protecting the public from aggression involving
biological agents, and allowing the biomedical research that is needed
to keep the 'real-life' natural infectious agent at bay and to enable
progress in our understanding of the ecology, epidemiology and best
diagnostic, prevention and treatment options for what may constitute a
minute bioweapons threat, but a real natural threat. [We conclude that
bioterrorism and smaller-scale atrocities involving biological agents do
indeed constitute a reality---a reality surrounded by
myths.]{.underline} We hope that this series of articles will facilitate
reasoned discussion of a problem whose absolute and relative dimensions
may be limited, but that we must not ignore.

**[Pakistan and India have]{.underline}** **[engaged in
military]{.underline}** and nuclear **[CBMs]{.underline}** [on numerous
occasions]{.underline}, despite non-cordial relations. The
**[first]{.underline}** **[step]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** the
**[military CBMs was the establishment of a hotline]{.underline}**
**[between the militaries]{.underline}** in 1971 following the model of
the United States' and USSR\'s military communications in the same
timeframe ([Ahmar
2001](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222),
87). However, **[the hotline]{.underline}** between the Director
Generals of Military Operations of both countries **[remained
symbolic]{.underline}**, **[and no practical advantages were effectively
achieved for maintaining peaceful relations]{.underline}**. The
**[hotline works well during peacetime]{.underline}** **[while it gets
suspended during crises build-ups, rendering it, in essence,
useless]{.underline}**. The sitting prime ministers of both countries,
Benazir Bhutto and Rajiv Gandhi, signed the next major CBM under the
umbrella of the Nuclear Threat Initiatives. **[This CBM aimed to prevent
attacks]{.underline}** **[on each other\'s nuclear
facilities]{.underline}** **[but does not provide any prevention against
foreign allies attacking such installations]{.underline}**. This measure
enabled the exchange of a list of nuclear facilities between both the
countries in 1992 (Shahid-ur-Rehman Khan
[1992](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222))
which helped to build trust and both the nuclear rivals respected the
arrangements during the peace as well as during times of increased
crisis. In 1991, Pakistan and India\'s CBMs progressed further as they
signed an agreement for prior notification regarding military exercises
and air space violations, especially near the LoC. This set of CBMs
opened further channels of communication in the military and diplomatic
domains to avoid the repetition of earlier crises but it could not
achieve the desired results owing to the non-availability of
implementation structures. The next CBM milestone was the 1992 agreement
on the complete prohibition of chemical weapons---both countries
declared that they do not possess any chemical weapons. However, these
CBMs suffered a considerable setback once India declared its chemical
weapons arsenal under the Chemical Weapons Convention ([Nuclear Threat
Initiative
2011a](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).
Such incidents created further suspicion between both countries---which
were already having problematic relations---and halted the advancement
in the process of confidence building. Pakistan considered the incident
as a violation of the bilateral agreement which widened the gulf in
trust deficit between the two countries. In the wake of this incident,
no further progress was achieved until 1999. Later, Nawaz Sharif and
Vajpayee concluded the Lahore Accord in 1999, which was a milestone
agreement for peacebuilding following the nuclear tests in 1998. This
agreement incorporated the concept of developing and employing CBMs in
both the conventional military and nuclear domains to avoid any untoward
nuclear weapons launch situations and to reduce the prospects for future
conflicts ([Nuclear Threat Initiative
2011b](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).
Unfortunately, this set of CBMs was undermined by the Kargil Conflict,
which started a few months after the declaration. This time it was the
Pakistani side that undermined the peace efforts as political and
military leaderships were not on the same page. Here the political
leadership tried to put some mechanisms in place for peaceful
coexistence, but the military institution spoiled these efforts. This
problem necessitates the requirement of structures that can implement
and sustain CBMs without significant interference from any state
institution, military in particular. From 1999 to 2003, tensions
remained high between both the states due to large-scale deployments
along the LoC, plus terrorist attacks in Srinagar and on the Indian
parliament. The UN General Assembly session of 2003 carved out a route
toward a ceasefire and later on to direct negotiations between the
political leadership of both countries ([Khawaja
2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222),
120--121). A new set of military and nuclear CBMs was then worked upon
which included the reduction of troops along the LoC, no further
development of military posts, and prior information regarding the
testing of ballistic missiles ([Krepon
2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).
The composite dialogue process constituted a major step forward which
aimed to resolve the issues between both countries through a strategy
that satisfies the demands of both countries ([Padder
2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).
This dialogue process provided the opportunity to discuss the peace
process through a diverse range of domains including the Kashmir issue.
However, all these CBMs halted in 2008 ([Gul
2007](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222))
after the terrorist attacks in Mumbai for which India blamed Pakistan.
Later, very few efforts were initiated in 2014 and 2015, but those did
not work due to pre-existing notions of trust deficit and further
accusations of terrorist attacks. [The primary issues in the
implementation of the military and nuclear CBMs]{.underline} **[are the
non-availability of a framework, transparency issues, and lack of
trust]{.underline}**. [Political aspects will also play a significant
role in the success of any military and nuclear CBMs]{.underline},
**[yet military and security concerns continue to undermine political
will]{.underline}** between these two states. While Pakistan and India
are so-called democratic countries, they do not have liberal democratic
structures and the separation of powers remains a contentious issue.
Additionally, [the policies adopted through CBMs]{.underline} **[proved
to be thoroughly incompatible]{.underline}** with follow-up actions
because the military and political leadership in both countries remained
suspicious of each other. **[These issues obstructed the implementation
of military and nuclear CBMs in both letter and spirit]{.underline}**.
The recurring crises between Pakistan and India after the Pulwama
attacks of 2019 highlight the shortfalls of the concept of nuclear
deterrence between both South Asian neighbors. Cyberspace also provides
a new domain for waging wars and there are no existing agreements
between Pakistan and India in this domain. A cyber-attack may prove
disastrous in provoking an unintentional war in the region ([Yamin
2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00438200211030222)).

Fifty years ago this week, former U.S. President Richard Nixon flew to
China, setting the stage for a dramatic shift in relations between the
two countries. Much has changed since that visit, not always for the
better. Despite a flurry of diplomatic activity over the past year,
U.S.-China ties remain tense. Discussions in
[Alaska](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56452471) and
[Tianjin](https://www.state.gov/deputy-secretary-shermans-visit-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china/)
yielded few, if any, breakthroughs. While friendlier in tone, the recent
summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden
led only to
[agreements](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/11/17/xi-biden-summit-us-china-policy/)
to hold yet more talks, albeit on important issues such as strategic
stability. The lone bilateral bright spot has been some cooperation on
[climate](https://www.state.gov/u-s-china-joint-glasgow-declaration-on-enhancing-climate-action-in-the-2020s/).
Since the summit, the [Biden]{.underline} [administration

more Chinese companies to its trade restriction list while Congress
passed a
[bill](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-passes-bill-targeting-china-over-uyghur-forced-labor-n1286160)
aimed at countering China's forced labor abuses in Xinjiang. **[The two
sides' antagonistic stances on issues related to]{.underline}**
security, economics**[, technology,]{.underline}** and ideology **[have
largely crystalized, leaving little space for the adjustments that could
relieve simmering tensions.]{.underline}** Below, Paul Haenle and Sam
Bresnick analyze how the two countries got here and how they can move
forward. WHY ARE THE TWO SIDES STUCK? Former U.S. President Donald Trump
ushered in a more confrontational era in U.S.-China relations, and Biden
has largely maintained his predecessor's approach to Beijing, albeit
with a more equanimous tone and embrace of multilateralism. The [U.S.
government has for decades been concerned by China's
mercantilism]{.underline}, rapid military modernization, and illiberal
approach to human rights, but it had held out hope that China might
liberalize through increasingly robust contact with the rest of the
world. That has not happened, and the United States and others have lost
patience with China's state capitalist system, militarization of the
South China Sea, and increasingly [authoritarian
governance](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/world/asia/china-hong-kong-security-law.html).
But Beijing is not backing down. Despite facing pronounced international
pushback during the pandemic, Xi has become even more confident in
China's economic system, governance model, and approach to international
affairs. "Time and momentum are on China's side," he
[argued](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3117314/xi-jinping-says-time-and-momentum-chinas-side-he-sets-out)
last year at a high-level meeting, though many analysts accuse the party
of
[overconfidence](https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/China-up-close/Analysis-From-leader-to-students-overconfidence-clouds-China).
At the same time, Chinese officials are increasingly looking askance at
their U.S. counterparts. Many appear to believe that the United States,
though still a formidable power, is in the early stages of an
[inevitable
decline](https://www.economist.com/china/2021/03/31/china-is-betting-that-the-west-is-in-irreversible-decline).
Just as China resumes its rightful place atop the hierarchy of Asian
nations, Beijing's thinking goes, the United States' unresolved racial
justice issues, income inequality, and political polarization will
catalyze an irreversible diminution of U.S. power in Asia and across the
globe. Complicating matters further, the **[U.S. and
Chinese]{.underline}** **[publics]{.underline}** **[are increasingly
distrustful of each other.]{.underline}** A whopping 89 percent of
American respondents to a recent
[survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/03/04/most-americans-support-tough-stance-toward-china-on-human-rights-economic-issues/)
from the Pew Research Center consider China a competitor or enemy, while
around [two-thirds](https://uscnpm.org/the-pulse/) of Chinese
respondents view the United States unfavorably or very unfavorably. Such
negative mutual perceptions would likely hamper each side's ability to
recalibrate its approach to the other. Finally, **[the two sides'
divergent framings of the relationship are contributing to the ongoing
[stalemate](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202107/t20210726_9134602.html)]{.underline}**.
Discussions with high-level Chinese scholars and former government
officials have revealed that Beijing prefers to define the bilateral
relationship as a peaceful coexistence guided by shared principles,
consensus, and possible cooperation. **[China is frustrated that the
United States is more focused on competing with and confronting
Beijing]{.underline}**. In Washington, however, great power rivalry,
defined more by competition and confrontation than cooperation, has
become the central framework for bilateral ties. HOW HAVE THESE
DIFFERING VIEWS AFFECTED POLICYMAKING? The pronounced turn in U.S.
policy toward China, beginning with the Trump administration, has not
led to self-reflection on the part of Beijing. Chinese scholars and
experts initially appeared somewhat
[surprised](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/world/asia/china-trade-war-trump.html)
that many of the economic, security, and technology policies that
Beijing has pursued for years have recently precipitated robust policy
responses from the United States. The ruling party believes that it is
merely continuing down the same path it established some years back,
which has led to its attributing the downturn in the bilateral
relationship solely to the United States. **[Chinese government
officials appear to believe the United States' goal is to

and the Quad's [increasing
coordination](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/11/975469203/quad-summit-biden-looks-to-boost-coordination-against-china),
as evidence of Washington's desire to
[contain](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202201/1246562.shtml) China
and limit Beijing's influence in the Indo-Pacific. Moreover, **[many
Chinese scholars and experts view U.S. restrictions on sensitive

[proof](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3164367/china-must-brace-digital-cold-war-us-battle-tech-supremacy)
that the United States seeks to hamper its burgeoning tech
sector.]{.underline}** Finally, they
[see](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202104/1220502.shtml)U.S.
complaints about human rights violations in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and
Tibet as disingenuous, given the United States' own problems with racial
justice and homelessness, as well as its high levels of wealth and
income inequality. In short, China sees the United States as a declining
power that is attempting to keep a rising China from overtaking it. The
United States, as expected, has a very different view of bilateral
dynamics. Washington blames the downturn in relations on China's
increasing assertiveness abroad and repressiveness at home. U.S.
officials are concerned that China, through its support of authoritarian
regimes, is chipping away at the liberal international order and trying
to create "[a world safe for
autocracy](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-06-11/world-safe-autocracy)";
that its continued military modernization and interest in building bases
in
[Cambodia](https://amti.csis.org/changes-underway-at-cambodias-ream-naval-base/),
[Equatorial
Guinea](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-seeks-first-military-base-on-africas-atlantic-coast-u-s-intelligence-finds-11638726327),
and the [United Arab
Emirates](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=dubai+chinese+military+bas)
will allow Beijing to challenge Washington's security primacy; and that
its state capitalist, mercantilist system threatens the rules-based
economic order. Beijing's incarceration of around [1 million Uighurs and
other Muslim
minorities](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-repression-uyghurs-xinjiang)
in Xinjiang, increasingly strict online censorship, and prosecution of
dissidents have further fueled Washington's desire to enact more
aggressive responses. WHAT DOES EACH SIDE WANT OUT OF THE RELATIONSHIP?
Our conversations have revealed that China wants the United States to
afford it the space it believes it deserves as a rising power, at least
in its own backyard. Beijing, as the preeminent Asian security and
economic actor, sees the United States' military presence in East and
Southeast Asia as inherently threatening. Moreover, it hopes that
Washington will ease pressure, especially regarding economics and
technology, as well as refrain from engaging in ideological competition
in service of impugning Beijing's governance model and human rights
record. But perhaps China's most significant wish is for the United
States to acknowledge the legitimacy of its economic and political
systems. Given that the United States views China's economic and
political practices as antithetical to its own, as well as to those of
countries acting within a healthy, properly functioning international
system, Washington is unlikely to refrain from impeaching Chinese
authoritarianism, mercantilism, and treatment of ethnic minorities and
dissidents. The United States' tougher policies and more confrontational
approach are meant to push back on and defend against a range of Chinese
domestic and foreign practices that threaten to undermine the
international rules and norms that have been in place since the end of
World War II, as well as raise the costs for China to revise that very
order. In general, Washington would prefer that Beijing dial back or
eliminate its economic and innovation mercantilism, respect other
countries' sovereignties, agree to peacefully resolve disputes, and
abide by international agreements on human rights. HOW CAN THE TWO SIDES
RECONCILE THEIR DIFFERENCES? Biden has opted to use a calmer, more
restrained tone with Beijing than did his predecessor, with the aim of
avoiding escalation. Moreover, unlike some Trump administration
[officials](https://www.wsj.com/articles/secretary-of-state-pompeo-to-urge-chinese-people-to-change-the-communist-party-11595517729),
Biden's team has made it clear that Washington is not seeking regime
change in China. And though Biden
[criticized](https://www.cfr.org/election2020/candidate-tracker) Trump's
lack of a clear set of goals or a coherent interagency policy framework
for addressing the China challenge, his administration has yet to
release its long-awaited [China
strategy](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-01-14/washingtons-missing-china-strategy)
(though China does figure prominently in its recently issued
[Indo-Pacific
Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/U.S.-Indo-Pacific-Strategy.pdf)).
Until that document is issued, the finer points of the administration's
plans to compete with Beijing, as well as the end goal of such
competition, will remain fuzzy. A clear articulation of U.S. aims would
be helpful in Washington's efforts to secure greater international
cooperation from allies and partners in addressing the challenges China
poses. It would also provide Chinese and U.S. leaders a starting point
from which to negotiate the future of bilateral ties. In China, there is
considerable room for greater self-reflection. Chinese leaders should
closely examine how Beijing's own aggressive diplomacy, economic
statecraft, military buildup, and human rights violations have alarmed
and unsettled the United States and many other countries, especially
those in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Across many conversations,
few, if any, Chinese experts have acknowledged that Beijing's actions
have played a role in the cratering of U.S.-China relations.
Furthermore, they are reluctant to acknowledge that numerous nations'
hardening stances toward China are driven by China's activities rather
than U.S. coercion. Acknowledging its agency in harming relations, as
well as its ability to take proactive steps to put U.S.-China ties on
better footing, would constitute important initial gestures by the
Chinese side. Moreover, China's willingness to take more responsibility
for its own actions and modify its policy and rhetoric would go a long
way toward stabilizing bilateral dynamics. There is no doubt the
U.S.-China relationship will remain competitive going forward.
Preventing bilateral ties from becoming even more hostile and
adversarial, however, should constitute a common aim for both countries.
Biden understands this, as he stressed the importance of developing
guardrails and establishing strategic stability talks between the two
governments [during his virtual
summit](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/16/readout-of-president-bidens-virtual-meeting-with-president-xi-jinping-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china/)
with Xi. Implementing robust crisis management mechanisms would also
prove a useful step in augmenting both nations' abilities to control
escalation in the event of a military incident in the increasingly
crowded waters and air space off of China's eastern and southern coasts.
Washington and Beijing also should establish an effective
problem-solving mode for the bilateral relationship. Many observers
stress the importance of U.S.-China cooperation on transnational issues
where the two sides have common interests---[climate
change](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/planetpolicy/2021/10/28/rebuilding-us-chinese-cooperation-on-climate-change-the-science-and-technology-opportunity/),
[nuclear
nonproliferation](https://www.brookings.edu/research/revitalizing-nonproliferation-cooperation-with-russia-and-china/),
and [global
health](https://www.csis.org/analysis/advancing-us-china-health-security-cooperation-era-strategic-competition),
among others. These efforts are certainly important, but they are quite
ambitious and often hampered by Washington's and Beijing's different
approaches to managing international issues. The two countries have thus
far failed to make progress in most areas. That does not mean they
should abandon these efforts. But perhaps the United States and China
should devote more energy toward trying to create a problem-solving
approach for addressing more pointed irritants, such as limits on
journalist visas and consulate closures. Such a method has already
yielded dividends regarding the [former
issue](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/16/us/politics/us-china-journalists.html).
The two countries should focus on how to build on those smaller
successes to work through larger problems in other areas. By committing
to this pragmatic approach, the United States and China may be able to
find a way to put a floor under deteriorating relations, begin to build
goodwill, and lay the foundation for taking on the larger structural
issues in areas, like trade and technology, that will be key to
determining the future health and welfare of the U.S.-China relationship
over the long term. Despite the two nations' differing mindsets and
approaches to bilateral ties, starting small could prove the best method
through which to, eventually, realize large gains.

## AT: Russian Sanctions

#### Sanctions fail -- They hurt the people NOT the military or leaders

Western sanctions against Russia,
<https://www.zawya.com/en/world/uk-and-europe/the-failure-of-western-sanctions-against-russia-gycrd12k>\]
//DHS WAgustin

[Historically]{.underline}, **[sanctions have failed to achieve any
political goals]{.underline}**. **[It is the worst weapon]{.underline}**
that the modern and contemporary **[international system has
produced]{.underline}**. **[Every time when sanctions were
imposed]{.underline}**, **[it was the people who paid the
price]{.underline}**, **[while these sanctions failed to harm the
leaders and officials in the targeted countries.]{.underline}** With the
beginning of the Russian war on Ukraine, a series of Western sanctions
are being slapped on the Russian side, and that has covered almost all
fields. This is up to the extent that one of the Western universities
canceled a lecture on Tolstoy on the pretext that he was a Russian! [The
Western nations wished that their sanctions would be so crushing and
thus deal a fatal blow to the Russian economy, **and hence they have
frozen Russian deposits as well as Russian assets abroad, leaving no
room for the Western hand to reach unless it was punished.** The worst
scenario was the]{.underline} **[attempt to isolate Russia from the
global banking payment system called SWIFT]{.underline}** (The Society
for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) **[as this makes
import and export a very complicated affair even though it would be
possible]{.underline}**. **[The Russian economy absorbed the first
blow]{.underline}**, despite the sagging ruble, but it **[quickly
recovered]{.underline}**, **[and even achieved higher gains than before
the war.]{.underline}** The obvious question that must be asked by
Western circles: what is the purpose of these sanctions? The answer, as
presented by Western politicians, is twofold: the first is the weakening
of the Russian economy, which affects the stability of the Putin
government and undermines confidence in Russian President Vladimir Putin
on the Russian street. However, **[the results of these sanctions were
counterproductive and the proportion of opponents of the war is very
small on the Russian street]{.underline}**, [and President Putin's
popularity is on the rise]{.underline}. [The second aspect is the effect
on the Russian war machine]{.underline}. [It is true that there were
many difficulties experienced by the Russian forces]{.underline},
especially in the beginning of the war, and the failure to capture Kiev,
and this forced the Russian leadership to change its military plans.
**[But this has nothing to do with the Western sanctions]{.underline}**.
Rather, the armed forces, like **[the Russian economy, have regained
their solidity and seemed more capable of achieving breakthroughs and
steady military progress]{.underline}**. This does not mean victory in
the war, but it means that the **[Russian forces were not affected by
the aforesaid sanctions. The Western sanctions on Russia made the supply
of Ukrainian grain a very difficult issue]{.underline}**, even if it was
done in relatively small quantities, and **[Russia\'s isolation from the
SWIFT regime made the supply of Russian grain no less
difficult.]{.underline}** If we know that both countries export 30
percent of the grain worldwide, it can be understood that the food
crisis that the world is beginning to suffer from, and which threatens
impending famines that might afflict a large number of the third world
countries, even though these countries have no part in the Ukrainian war
or in the conflict between the West and Russia. The worst is that the
[European societies themselves have begun to suffer from the rise in the
prices of essential goods,]{.underline} as the prices of fuels increased
by up to 40 percent, and this led to a rise in most essential goods,
especially foodstuffs. After the experience of the past months, **[the
Western sanctions on Russia are like those who shoot themselves in the
feet.]{.underline}** In fact, **[Moscow has benefited from sanctions on
the energy]{.underline}** **[sector]{.underline}**. What it was unable
to export was compensated by the rise in oil prices. It is clear that
the West must change its strategy, and this can only be done by bitterly
admitting that it has failed miserably in its policy of imposing
sanctions against Russia.

"Applying next-generation technology to convert legacy fossil fuel waste

driving us forward to our clean energy goals," said U.S. Secretary of
Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. "[With **the Bipartisan Infrastructure

of tons of coal waste and ash, acid mine drainage, and produced water.
The legacy wastes left behind by coal mining and related activities all
contain a wide variety of valuable minerals and materials. Each of them
offers an untapped resource for producing a wealth of critical minerals.
REEs and CMs are essential materials that are used in a broad range of
technologies that are significant to national security and energy, such
as advanced aircraft, wind turbines, electric vehicles, semiconductors,
and hydrogen fuel cells. [Currently, even when REEs are being mined
within the U.S., they are shipped overseas for processing, before being
sold back to the U.S. in more expensive products.]{.underline}
