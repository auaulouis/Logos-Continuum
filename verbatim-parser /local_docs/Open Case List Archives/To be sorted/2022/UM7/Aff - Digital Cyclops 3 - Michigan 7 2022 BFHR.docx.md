### Thesis -- Technical Knowledge

#### Hermeneutical production of knowledge and the forecasting of technical futures is not a neutral project -- it resymbolizes and overcodes thought itself towards a cybernetic metaphysics

[The rejection of the notion of knowledge as reducible to science and
calculation is an attempt to show that there is knowledge such as savoir
faire, savoir vivre, and savoir-écouter that are beyond the realm of
scientific knowledge]{.underline}. Stiegler seems to have gone a step
further in this respect by showing that savoir faire is necessary for
savoir vivre, and that therefore the deprivation of savoir faire is a
form of proletarianization, which problematizes existence by undermining
the means of subsistence. [The **shift in the sense of knowledge** in
the era of **digital automation** underlines a **delegation of knowledge
production and decision making to machines**. Lyotard says that "the
question of knowledge is now more than ever a question of government."
26 The organic totality of the system that is based on recursivity is
realized through **different technological schemes** (such as the smart
city, the internet of things, etc.), which characterize a **planetary
computation**]{.underline}. In chapter 4 we named the new faculty of the
machine to anticipate tertiary protention. [The preemption of the
tertiary protention is possible only because of the computational
hermeneutics, which is essentially recursive: It constantly evaluates
the past in order to anticipate the future, which in turn determines the
present. Human beings are **reintegrated into the temporality of
machines**, not only as individuals but also as collectives and
communities. This is precisely what is called algorithmic
governmentality]{.underline}. 27 It seems to me that in order to
intervene into this new temporal structure today, it is necessary (while
we have to do it elsewhere) to redefine savoir faire---or, more
precisely, savoir technique---in today's system of knowledge production.

Besides theoretical discourse on the question of recursivity and social
systems in the work of Niklas Luhmann and Heinz von Foerster, who also
gives another name to recursion---"non-trivial machines" (ironically,
Lyotard also calls cybernetic information theory trivial) 28---we have
attempted to show that such [**discourses are gradually materialized**
through the implementation and distribution of smart objects,
neuro-networks in urbanism, and the use of smart devices in order to
access infrastructures. In this process of the totalization of the
technological system, the immediate effect is the process of
**desymbolization** through the establishment of **inter-objective
relations** and **resymbolization** within the technical
system]{.underline}, as Jacques Ellul pointed out in his Le système
technicien. 29 When Ellul says that ["on the one hand, man's inherent
power of symbolizing is excluded; on the other hand, **all consumption
is symbolic**," 30 he means that symbols that connect humans to nature
and allow them to master nature in a nonviolent way **slowly give way to
technology**, and finally lead to a resymbolization of the technical
system in which symbols are no longer linked to nature but to
commodities.]{.underline}

[The social system is not separable from the technical system. Indeed
the technical system is the support of the social system, not only in
terms of communication but also in terms of organization.]{.underline}
The social system is not reducible to the technical system, though this
reduction is taking place rapidly at the moment. Written two years after
Ellul's Technological System, Lyotard's The Postmodern Condition also
hints at the realization of totalized technical systems when he says
that ["the growth of power, and its self-legitimation, are now taking
the route of data storage and accessibility, and the **operativity of
information**." 31 The realization of this system is for Lyotard the
continuation of the concept of development, which is a **metaphysics
without finality**: "\[W\]e are in an Umwelt that is the realization of
metaphysics as a general physics under the name of
cybernetics."]{.underline} 32 Lyotard here takes up both Heidegger's
verdict on the status of cybernetics and Luhmann's systems theory, which
is the avatar of a "general physics." 33 [Cybernetics realizes
metaphysics, makes metaphysics reality, and **establishes its right over
thinking**. 34]{.underline} What is left for metaphysics is to
incorporate the outside as its inside, to exclude itself as the dominant
thinking. [For systems theorists the task is not to get out of the
system but rather how to optimize the system by modulating its
performativity and increasing its capacity for resilience based on
feedback. 35]{.underline} Therefore, when modern leftists lament that
there is no longer any outside, they become the true metaphysicians. The
opposition between engineering and the humanities can be caricatured as
an opposition between positivism and hermeneutics, or between efficiency
and reflexivity, but such a distinction, as Lyotard already noted while
commenting on the Frankfurt School, is not acceptable, 36 for the
solution proposed by the latter "is no longer relevant" in postmodern
societies, since this opposition ceases to function as a critical
apparatus. 37

§40. TECHNOSPHERE OR CHRISTOGENESIS

Instead of seeing cybernetics as a nonphilosophical system, in this work
I have been attempting to show that [cybernetics is fundamentally a
metaphysical project. The passage from nature to logic, from the
organized inorganic to the organizing inorganic, is staged as a
**conceptual conflict between form and matter**. However, this has not
been presented as the triumph of one over the other, since they are not
separable]{.underline}. It is only in our archaic epistemology that form
and matter are separated, and this conflict is interpreted as a
philosophical melodrama. [With the organizing inorganic, where are the
humans heading with their technologies? For decades we have been talking
about an intelligence explosion, superintelligence, the technological
singularity, a **foreseeable technological utopia** in which genetic
engineering, human enhancement, and immortality are
promised.]{.underline} Speculation concerning what comes after the human
has been widely discussed. [The emergence of x-humanisms, whether this x
be post- or trans-, attempts to point to a definite future in which
humans can be either saved by a posthuman ethics or by **advanced
technologies**. On the one hand, the posthuman gives us an impression of
liberation, of freeing ourselves from the older category of the human.
On the other hand, this "being liberated" is nothing other than the fact
that humans have become obsolete in relation to their own
products]{.underline}, as Günther Anders has described in his The
Obsolescence of Man. 38 I am very sympathetic with posthuman discourse
and with the idea that the humanities must fight against any
anthropocentrism for what the Italian theorist Rosi Braidotti calls
posthumanities. 39 However, certain forms of posthuman discourse also
betray a naive attitude toward technology, seeing it simply as secondary
to a "true" and "good" posthuman ontology, as if all oppositions can be
neatly resolved by a theoretical canon, whether this be a process
philosophy or a relational ontology, while completely ignoring the
transformation of machine-organism relations that we have endeavored to
illuminate.

[Transhumanists]{.underline}, on the other hand, take an opposite
position and [exploit technology to an extreme. They embrace
functionalism (seeing the human as composed of functions that can be
improved individually) and an interdisciplinary program for human
enhancement, including information technology, computer science,
cognitive science and neuroscience, neuralcomputer interface research,
materials science, artificial intelligence, regenerative medicine and
life extension, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology. 40 They
emphasize the importance of technology as a means to extropia (as
opposed to the "static utopia"), an open-ended perfection of the human
species. 41]{.underline} There is an ambiguity between the terms
transhuman and posthuman. For example, transhumanists like Nick Bostrom
see the transhuman as a form of the posthuman, which possesses some
posthuman capacities transcending the limits of the human (for example,
life span, cognition, and emotion). 42 We may recognize that the
transhuman sounds like a typical "scientific humanism," 43 and indeed it
is a humanism under the guise of a posthumanism. We want to point out
that the posthuman cannot be defined according to a simple divide
between a clean posthumanities and an outdated humanism, 44 so the
transhuman cannot be seen as an enthusiastic open transhumanism opposing
a closed dualist humanism.

However, here we would like to question the notion of humanity before we
justify distancing ourselves from it. Carl Schmitt, in his The Concept
of the Political, claims that "the concept of humanity is an especially
useful ideological instrument of imperialist expansion, and in its
ethical-humanitarian form it is a specific vehicle of economic
imperialism. Here one is reminded of a somewhat modified expression of
Proudhon's: whoever invokes humanity wants to cheat." 45 What Schmidt is
saying here deserves our attention, since [the term humanity itself is
problematic and any attempt to define a **new future for humanity**
seems to be a form of cheating]{.underline}. Schiller was able to talk
about the realization of humanity since Enlightenment humanism was
necessary for his epoch, while after more than two hundred years we will
have to face a new politics announced as the end of the Enlightenment.
46 This politics concerns not so much human nature as inhumanity.
Humanist discourse continues, and it is indicated by a political
theology that entails a rather simplistic conception of world history,
which we can analyze as a linear progress from premodern → modern →
postmodern → apocalypse. [This Judeo-Christian eschatology seems to be a
dominating discourse in which science and technology will bring forward
a system that is more and more favorable for human existence while it
will finally confront self-destruction, and what remains is the
salvation or the completion of world history as theodicy]{.underline}.
It is not without surprise to see that this end of history resonates
with the concept of the Homo deus, since by then theodicy will be
indicated by transformation of humanity into a kingdom of gods. [The
author of Homo Deus introduces dataism, a human-algorithm reduction; in
the name of "life science,"]{.underline} dataism claims that:

1\. Organisms are algorithms, and humans are not individuals---they are
"dividuals"; that is, humans are an assemblage of many different
algorithms lacking a single inner voice or a single self.

2\. The algorithms constituting a human are not free. They are shaped by
genes and environmental pressures, and take decisions either
deterministically or randomly---but not freely.

3\. It follows that an external algorithm could theoretically know me
much better than I can ever know myself. . . . Once developed, such an
algorithm could replace the voter, the customer, and the beholder. Then
the algorithm will know best, the algorithm will always be right, and
beauty will be in the calculations of the algorithm. 47

[The transhumanist tone]{.underline}, claiming insight from "life
science," [has already pointed to the future of humanity, which can be
reduced to **artificial intelligences** governed by a superintelligence
that knows anything and everything]{.underline}. We can find a similar
argument in Teilhard's concept of the noosphere. The noosphere [will
finally lead to the realization of a superorganism: the Brain of all
brains. Through the systematization and planetarization of
tools---especially automation ---it will finally lead to the complete
liberation of human beings from production ---or, in economic terms,
mass unemploym]{.underline}ent. Teilhard doesn't see this mass
unemployment as a danger but rather as the possibility of the
realization of humanity. Like Schiller, who was concerned by the
determination and domination of reason, Teilhard was also obliged to
address the question of freedom. He distinguishes two types of freedom:
individual freedom and collective freedom. The realization of the
technical system as a superorganism may undermine individual freedom,
but it also realizes collective freedom: "One might put it that
determinism appears at either end of the process of cosmic evolution,
but in antithetically opposed forms: at the lower end it is forced along
the line of the most probable for lack of freedom; at the upper end it
is an ascent into the improbable through the triumph of freedom." 48

Teilhard avoids a crucial problem here: What really is "collective
freedom," and how can it justify the sacrifice of individual freedom? Is
it not similar to the argument of "collectivism" that we have seen in
former communist regimes? And further, what precisely is meant by
"convergence"? We have seen in chapter 4 what Simondon calls
convergence, which is not the convergence facilitated by transport and
communications network, but rather to reattach the figure to the ground.
But maybe at the end, for Teilhard, the question of the future of
humankind is fundamentally a theological one, as he indicated in a note
in the text we cited above titled "The Formation of the Noosphere,"
published in Revue des Questions Scientifiques: "The description of the
Noosphere and its attendant biology, as here propounded, is no more
opposed to the Divine Transcendence, to Grace, to the Incarnation or to
the ultimate Parousia, than is the science of paleontology to the
Creation, or of embryology to the First Cause. The reverse is true." 49

What Teilhard said concerning the process of evolution and the
realization of the superorganism is now much easier to imagine than when
he wrote it in the first half of the twentieth century. Today [this
image is **reinforced by the fantasy of the technological singularity**,
in which the speed of technological development will be indicated by a
vertical acceleration. We may say then say that this is a true
completion of humanity, since there will no longer be a sharp
distinction between the finite and the infinite]{.underline}. In a
review of The Phenomenon of Man titled "Cosmologist of the future,"
Joseph Needham called Teilhard "the greatest prophet of this age." 50 He
admired Teilhard's work and regarded the "convergent integration" (a
term that was employed by Julian Huxley in his preface to The Phenomenon
of Man) of the superorganism or superbrain as the most original point of
the book, which could be seen as a "Christogenesis":

\[T\]ime is also of the essence; there was a time when there were atoms
but no molecules, later on there were nucleoprotein molecules but no
living cells, later fishes but no mammals, later man but no cooperative
commonwealth. What are these propositions? Simply, the view of the
universe held by the overwhelming majority of working scientists in our
age. Implicit in it is the conviction that social evolution is
continuous with biological evolution, and therefore that what
materialist theologians have called the kingdom of God on Earth is not a
desperate hope but a sure development with all the authority of
evolution behind it. 51

[However, in the spirit of eschatology one may ask: Is this completion
of humanity a revelation or a catastrophic becoming? We are asking this
question, as most of the sci-fi movies do, since we are living in an
epoch of technological uncertainty and instability. Cybernetics, the
accomplishment of metaphysics, is the force unifying "humanity" through
globalization and neocolonization]{.underline}. In other words, we can
use the vocabulary of Gestalt psychology in claiming that [**technology
becomes the ground instead of the figure**. The noosphere becomes the
most dominating sphere on earth, overriding the biosphere]{.underline}.
The system is an indication (or the Absolute in the Hegelian sense) of
the evolution of science and humanity, 52 but it doesn't necessarily
take the form that Schiller envisaged in terms of artistic creation.
[Any future philosophy that ignores the question of system is
**fundamentally deficient.**]{.underline}

### Thesis -- "No"

#### The aff has asked us to negate it as a valuable enterprise -- we say "No".

**Kroker 14** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and adjunct professor
of political science at the University of Victoria, "Exits to the
Posthuman Future", Polity Press, Pages 202-204, 2014, MG)

[Refusing to secrete itself in those bureaucratic institutions that
produce mechanisms of domination]{.underline} (the clinic, the prison,
[**the school**), cynical ideology thrives by making a continuous
spectacle of its presence. It is a line of flight, an intensity that
doubles and redoubles its effects. When power becomes image, cynical
truth is volatilized by the image repertoire]{.underline}. It knows only
media effects. It migrates across different media. [It changes state as
it seeks points of **maximal intensity for communication** with a
humiliated public]{.underline}. It is without history because it leaves
no fixed electronic trail. [Its truth-value depends precisely on its
articulation of perspectives that strengthen movements towards panic
insecurity and redemptive violence. While power aligns itself with
knowledge, not ideology, **cynical ideology aligns itself with virtual
truth**, not power. Privileging sacrificial death over the life of
power, cynical ideology represents truth in its last decadent phase as a
concept-fiction.]{.underline}

[In the age of cynical ideology, everything has **value** only to the
extent that it has **"abuse value**]{.underline}." Heidegger recognized
this. Understanding Nietzsche as the essential philosopher of completed
nihilism, Heidegger drew the bitter ethical conclusions attendant upon
the reduction of being to passive "standing reserve." For Heidegger,
[the mood of completed nihilism will be the "malice of strife" that
takes pleasure in the greater calculus of abuse value. Today, the
theater of abuse value is ubiquitous: **the rage of violence** directed
against the old, the poor, the young, the sick, the powerless, the
disavowed, the unlivable. Political lying is itself a form of abuse
value with the object of abuse being the rupturing of that deep
connection between truth-saying and the responsibilities of democratic
citizenship]{.underline}. When citizenship itself is made an object of
abuse value (by manipulation of vote counts, by public lies, by panic
fear), the essential ethical core of democracy is undermined. [We\'re
left finally with the **terrorism of the image**, a new form of nihilism
suitable for the technological age in which ministrations of redemptive
violence during the daylight hours are soothed away by the nighttime
jokes of all the talk-show hosts. A moral equivalency of nothingness --
organized state terrorism and diffuse media distraction as the basic
political logic of a society of completed nihilism]{.underline}. This is
not an image of Foucault\'s world of power. Nor is it Deleuze and
Guattari\'s searing vision of lines of flight and points of intensity --
becoming wolf-man, becoming maggot-man, becoming predator, becoming
parasite[. It is something new, still emergent, still articulating
itself, still learning to speak, still growing in strength, still
waiting to fully disclose itself -- cynical ideology]{.underline}.

Nonetheless, there is much to be learned from Foucault\'s theory of
power [in terms of what resists power, what produces that fatal rupture
in individual subjectivity that has the effect of overcoming fear and
stirring again the passionate desire for]{.underline}
[freedom]{.underline}. That this is an elemental human desire tracing a
larger arc of history across countries, whole continents, until it
encompasses global consciousness is indisputable. [Everywhere in the
past, as in the present and future, power as domination meets its
**equal** in the stubborn, always ethically recalcitrant, presence of an
**individual subjectivity that says "No,"** and thereby marks **one
individual at a time**, one body at a time, one **refusal** at a time
the furthest limits of domination]{.underline}. Foucault knew this. It
is everywhere in his work from the repressed history of erotic passion
that makes of The History of Sexuality an emblematic study of the
entwinement of passion and freedom in the politics of the body to the
tortured revolt against the body of the king and its ceremonial
punishment that introduces Discipline and Punish. [Whether in the "grey
genealogy of power" or in his eloquent reflections on the history
of]{.underline} ~~madness~~ [or the troubled histories of medicine,
knowledge, and aesthetics, there is always the presence of the
**individual act of dissent**, the philosophical heresy, the medical
rupture, the lover\'s forbidden embrace that constitutes, at first in
minor note and then, with gathering strength, an irresistible momentum
towards generalized discursive change.]{.underline}

Foucault may have been the master of discourse analysis, the theorist
who brought into the light of day the alliance of regulations,
prohibitions, modes of thought, public rhetoric that, taken together,
comes to be known as the discourse of power, the discourse of the
intelligible body, the discourse of sexuality, the discourse of
punishment. But for all that, the seduction of Foucault\'s thought, that
which has made of his philosophical life a haunting marker denoting a
larger shift in cultural sensibility, was the simple fact that, while
Foucault\'s theory of power may have described its historical
machinations in grisly, meticulous detail, the lasting legacy of his
thought is that his theory of power is also its own undoing. For no
sooner does Foucault remind us that [power is a network, that it
**circulates**, that it operates as a "relation of force," that it
actually produces subjectivity, then his theory of power seems to
shudder to a halt, to maintain its stability only on the basis of a
violent internal repression]{.underline}. Ironically, if Foucault could
argue time and again that resistance to power is one of the fundamental
conditions for the preservation of power, that [**power feeds on its
oppositions**,]{.underline} that is only to say that everywhere in
Foucault\'s thought there is acute awareness of that which lies outside
and at one remove from the reach of power: [that which is **prohibited,
excluded, disavowed, rendered unknowable**, perhaps even unlivable, by
the discourse of power.]{.underline}

Many commentators on Foucault have grasped the fundamental truth of his
insights [concerning the doubled nature of]{.underline}
[power]{.underline}. For example, Judith Butler\'s The Psychic Life of
Power represents a sustained meditation on [the dialectic of
**affirmations** and prohibitions marking the discourse of
power]{.underline}. Wendy Brown\'s States of Injury does much the same,
this time though tracing the doubled dialectic of power as it works its
way through the contemporary psycho-geography of political ressentiment.
In chapter and verse, Butler and Brown are faithful to Foucault\'s
teachings concerning power, namely that the regimes of intelligibility
required by power always mark the unmarkable, specifically that which
must be made unknowable, unlivable, unsustainable so that power can
exist. Indeed, more than a historical record of the outlawed
sexualities, the forbidden genders, the transgressionary crossings that
mark the limits of power, the theoretical reflections of theorists such
as Butler and Brown have the added measure of following the trace of
Nietzsche in Foucault.

### AT: Framework

#### Dead Information DA -- their model is reminiscent of the digital superhighway, a new technological frontier where communication and meaning are maximized to create dead information that is used to pave the highway with our flesh, giving us the choice to succumb to the system and adapt, or we're toast 

**Weinstein** and Kroker **94** (Arthur Kroker - emeritus professor and
adjunct professor of political science at the University of Victoria,
Michael Weinstein -- Professor of Political Philsophy at Purdue
University, "Data Trash: The Theory of the Virtual Class", New World
Perspectives, Pages 6-8, 15 September 1994, MG)

[The virtual class has driven to global power along the digital
superhighway]{.underline}. Representing perfectly the expansionary
interests of the recombinant commodity-form, [the virtual class has
seized the **imagination**]{.underline} of contemporary culture [by
conceiving a **techno-utopian** high-speed cybernetic grid for
travelling across the electronic frontier. In this mythology of the
**new technological frontier**, contemporary society is either equipped
for fast travel down the main arterial lanes of the information highway,
or it simply ceases to exist as a functioning member of
technotopia.]{.underline} As the CEO's and the specialist consultants of
the virtual class triumphantly proclaim: **["Adapt or you're
toast."]{.underline}**

[We now live in the age of dead]{.underline} information, dead
(electronic) space, and dead (cybernetic) rhetoric. [Dead information?
That's our **cooptation as servomechanisms of the cybernetic grid** (the
digital superhighway) that swallows bodies, and even whole societies,
into the dynamic momentum of its telematic logic. Always working on the
basis of the illusion of **enhanced interactivity**, the digital
superhighway is really about the full immersion of the flesh into its
virtual double]{.underline}. As dead (electronic) space, the digital
superhighway is a big real estate venture in cybernetic form, where
competing claims to intellectual property rights in an array of
multi-media technologies of communication are at stake. No longer
capitalism under the doubled sign of consumer and production models,
[the digital superhighway represents the disappearance of capitalism
into **colonized virtual space**, and dead (cybernetic) rhetoric? That's
the Internet's subordination to the predatory business interests of a
virtual class, which might pay virtual lip service to the growth of
electronic communities on a global basis, but which is devoted in
actuality to shutting down the anarchy of the Net in favor of
**virtualized (commercial) exchange**. Like a mirror image, the digital
superhighway always means its opposite: **not an open telematic
autoroute** for fast circulation across the electronic galaxy, but an
**immensely seductive harvesting machine** for delivering bodies,
culture, and labor to virtualization. **The information highway is paved
with (our) flesh**. So]{.underline} consequently, the theory of the
virtual class: cultural accomodation to technotopia is its goal,
political consolidation (around the aims of the virtual class) its
method, multi-media nervous systems its relay, and (our) disappearance
into pure virtualities its ecstatic destiny.

That there is an inherent political contradiction between the attempt by
the virtual class to liquidate the sprawling web of the Internet in
favor of the smooth telematic vision of the digital superhighway is
apparent. The information highway is the antithesis of the Net, in much
the same way as the virtual class must destroy the public dimension of
the Internet for its own survival. [The informational technology of the
Internet as a new force of virtual production provides the social
conditions necessary for instituting fundamentally new relations of
electronic creation]{.underline}. Spontaneously and certainly against
the long-range interests of the virtual class, the Internet has been
swamped by demands for meaning. Newly screen-radiated scholars dream up
visions of a Virtual University, the population of Amsterdam goes
on-line as Digital City, environmentalists become web weavers as they
form a global Green cybernetic informational grid, and a new generation
of fiction writers develops forms of telematic writing that mirror the
crystalline structures and multi-phasal connections of hypertext.

[But, of course, for the virtual class, **content slows the speed of
virtualized exchange**, and meaning becomes the **antagonistic
contradiction of data**. Accordingly, demands for meaning must be
immediately denied as just another road-kill along the virtual highway.
As such, the virtual class exercises its intense obsessive-compulsive
drive to subordinate society to the telematic mythology of the digital
superhighway]{.underline}. The democratic possibilities of the Internet,
with its immanent appeal to new forms of global communication, might
have been the seduction-strategy appropriate for the construction of the
digital superhighway, but now that the cybernetic, grid is firmly in
control, [the virtual class must move to liquidate the Internet. It is
an old scenario, repeated this time in virtual form. Marx understood
this first: every technology releases opposing possibilities towards
**emancipation and domination**.]{.underline} Like its early bourgeois
predecessors at the birth of capitalism, the virtual class christens the
birth of technotopia by suppressing the potentially emancipatory
relations of production released by the Internet in favor of the
traditionally predatory force of production signified by the digital
superhighway. [Data is the **anti-virus** of meaning-telematic
information refuses to be slowed down by the drag-weight of
content]{.underline}. And the virtual class seeks to exterminate the
social possibilities of the Internet. These are the first lessons of the
theory of the virtual class.

#### The resolution acts as the latest computer industry, attempting to get debaters to "sell" and "hype" their emergent technology ideas of a new techno-utopian world in an act that secretes ideological bindings and eats debaters alive -- the only thing that'll ever come out of the topic is training on how to be a good little data dump robot for late-stage capitalism

["Public policy" is what goes on **to get the flesh to adjust to the
Net**. The greater project is **beyond policy**]{.underline},
transcendent to it-that is the project of wiring bodies to the Net.
[That everyone will be wired to the information-highway machine is an
historical inevitability that puts politics in its place as a local
clean-up activity around the Net. This is technotopianism in its purest
and most cynical form]{.underline}. Compare it to that other computer
entrepreneur, the retro-fascist Ross Perot, who uses the wealth he has
gained from the information industry to finance his appeal to a
nationalistic policy. [The technotopian has no such leanings, but with
vicious naivete depends on liberal-fascist allies in government to
protect the Net.]{.underline} Gates has identified himself with
Technology, the greater power, the one that will finally be decisive.
[Through the **silent seduction** of the operating-system.]{.underline}

The Virtual Class and Capitalism

[The]{.underline} computer [industry is in an intensive phase of
"**creative destruction**]{.underline}," the term coined by Schumpeter
and used by the neo- Darwinian macho apologists for capitalism to refer
to the economic killing fields produced by rapid technological change.
[The Net is being brought into actuality through the offices of ruthless
capitalist competition,]{.underline} in which vast empires fall and rise
within a single decade (Big Blue/Microsoft). Under the disciplinary
liberal night watchman's protection of "private" property-rights,
capitalist freebooters destroy one another as they race to be the ones
who actualize the Net, just like the railroads of the nineteenth-century
racing across the continent. This means that [the virtual class retains
a strict capitalist determination and that its representative social
type must be a capitalist]{.underline}, someone who is installing the
highway to win a financial competition, if nothing else. [If one is not
so minded in today's computer industry they **will be eaten alive**. You
will only be able to get personal kicks and pursue your
(ressentiment-laden) idealistic views of computer democracy in this
industry **if you sell**. So you **hype your ideas** and your **ideals
become hype-that is the twisted psychology of the virtual class**: not
hyped ideology, but something of, by, and for the Net: ideological
hype.]{.underline}

There are pure capitalists in the cyber industry and there are
capitalists who are also visionary computer specialists. The latter, in
a spirit of vicious naivete, generate the ideological hype, a messianic
element, that the former take up cynically. It's the old story of the
good cop and the bad cop. How come the good cop tolerates the bad cop?
So much for the computer democracy of cyber possessive-individualists.
[The economic base of the virtual class is the entire communications
industry-everywhere it reaches. As a whole, this industry **processes
ideological hype for capitalist ends**. It is most significantly
constituted by cynicism, not viciously naive vision. Yet, though a small
group in numerical proportion to the whole virtual class, the
visionaries are essential to cyber-capitalism because they provide the
ideological mediation to seduce the flesh into the Net.]{.underline} In
this sense the cynical capitalists and the well-provided techies are
merely drones, clearing the way for the Pied Piper's parade.

[A **frontier mentality rules the drive into cyber-space**]{.underline}.
It is one of the supreme ironies that a primitive form of capitalism, a
retro-capitalism, is actualizing virtuality. [The visionary
cyber-capitalist is a hybrid monster of social Darwinism and
techno-populist individualism. It is just such an imminently reversible
figure that can provide the switching mechanism back and forth between
cyber-space and the collapsing space of (crashed)
perception.]{.underline}

[The most complete representative of the virtual class is the
**visionary capitalist** who is constituted by all of its contradictions
and who, therefore, **secretes its ideological hype**]{.underline}. The
rest of the class tends to split the contradictions: the
visionless-cynical-business capitalists and the perhaps visionary,
perhaps skill-oriented, perhaps indifferent technointelligentsia
ofcognitive scientists, engineers, computer scientists, videogame
developers, and all the other communication specialists, ranged in
hierarchies, but all dependent for their economic support on the drive
to virtualization. Whatever contradictions there are within the virtual
class-that is, the contradictions stemming from the confrontation of
bourgeois and proletarian-the class as a whole supports the drive into
cyber-space through the wired world. This is the way it works in post
latecapitalism, where [the communication complex is **repeating the
pattern of class collaborationism** that marked the old
military-industrial complex. The drive into the Net is one of those
great capitalist techno- projects that depends upon a concert of
interests to sustain it, as it sucks social energy into
itself]{.underline}. The phenomenon of a collaborationist complex
harboring a retro-Darwinian competition is something new, but is
stabilized, in the final analysis, by a broad consensus among the
capitalist components of the virtual class that the liberal-fascist
state structure is deserving of support. Indeed, in the U.S.A. in the
1990s the state is the greatest producer of the ideological hype of the
"information highway." The virtual class has its administration in the
White House. The concerted drive into cyber-space proceeds, all in the
name of economic development and a utopian imaginary of possessive
individualists.

The Hyper-Texted Body or Nietzsche Gets a Modem

But why be nostalgic? The old body type was always OK, but the wired
body with its micro-flesh, multi-media channeled ports, cybernetic
fingers, and bubbling neuro-brain finely interfaced to the "standard
operating-system" of the Internet is infinitely better. Not really the
wired body of sci-fi with its mutant designer look, or body flesh with
its ghostly reminders of nineteenth-century philosophy, but the
hyper-texted body as both: a wired nervous system embedded in living
(dedicated) flesh.

[The hyper-texted body with its dedicated flesh? That is **our telematic
future**, and it's not necessarily so bleak. Technology has always been
our sheltering environment: not second-order nature, but primal nature
for the twenty-first-century body]{.underline}. In the end, the virtual
class is very oldfashioned. It clings to an antiquated historical
form-capitalism-and, on its behalf, wants to shut down the creative
possibilities of the Internet. Dedicated flesh rebels against the
virtual class. It does not want to be interfaced to the Net through
modems and external software black boxes, but actually wants to be an
Internet. [The virtual class wants to **appropriate emergent
technologies** for purposes of authoritarian political control over
cyberspace. It wants to drag technotopia back to the age of the
primitive politics of predatory capitalism.]{.underline} But dedicated
(geek) flesh wants something very different. Unlike the (typically
European) rejection of technotopia in favor of a newly emergent
nostalgia movement under the sign of "Back to Vinyl" in digital sound or
"Back to. Pencils" in literature, [dedicated flesh wants to **deeply
instantiate the age of technotopia**. Operating by means of the
aesthetic strategy of over- identification with the feared and desired
object, the hyper-texted body insists that ours is already the era of
post-capitalism, and even posttechnology. Taking the will to virtuality
seriously, it **demands its telematic rights** to be a functioning
interfaced body: to be a multi-media thinker, to patch BUS ports on its
cyber-flesh as it navigates the gravity well of the Internet, to create
aesthetic visions equal to the pure virtualities found everywhere on the
now superceded digital superhighway, and to become data to such a point
of **violent implosion that the body finally breaks free** of the
confining myth of "wired culture" and goes wireless.]{.underline}

The wireless body? [That is the floating body, drifting around in the
debris of technotopia: encrypted flesh in a sea of data]{.underline}.
The perfect evolutionary successor to twentieth-century flesh, [the
wireless body fuses the speed ofvirtualized exchange into its cellular
structure. DNA-coated data is inserted directly **through spinal taps
into dedicated flesh** for better navigation through the treacherous
shoals of the electronic galaxy. Not a body without memory or feelings,
but the opposite. The wireless body is the battleground of the major
political and ethical conflicts of latetwentieth- and
early-twenty-first-century experience.]{.underline}

[Perhaps the wireless body will be just a **blank data dump**, a
floating petrie-dish where all the brilliant residues of technotopia are
**mixed together** in newly recombinant forms]{.underline}. In this
case, the wireless body would be an indefinitely reprogrammable chip:
micro-soft flesh where the "standard operating-system" of the new
electronic age comes off the top of the TV set, flips inside the body
organic, and is soft-wired to a waiting vat of remaindered flesh.

[But the wireless body could be, and already is, something very
different. Not the body as an organic grid for passively sampling all
the drifting bytes of recombinant culture, but the wireless body as a
**highly-charged theoretical and political site**: a moving field of
aesthetic contestation for remapping the galactic empire of
technotopia]{.underline}. Data flesh can speak so confidently of the
possibility of multi-media democracy, of sex without secretions, and
ofintegrated (cyber-) relationships because it has already burst through
to the other side of technotopia: to that point of brilliant dissolution
where the Net comes alive, and begins to speak the language of wireless
bodies in a wireless world.

There are already many wireless bodies on the Internet: Many data
travellers on the virtual road have managed under the weight of the
predatory capitalism of the virtual class and the even weightier
humanist prejudices against geek flesh, to make of the Internet a
charmed site for fusing the particle waves of all the passing data into
a new body type: hyper-texted bodies circulating as "web weavers" in
electronic space.

Refusing to be remaindered as flesh dumped by the virtual class, t[he
hyper-texted body **bends virtuality to its own purposes**. Here, the
will to virtuality ceases to be one-dimensional, becoming a doubled
process, grisly yet creative, spatial yet memoried, in full violent play
as the hypertexted body]{.underline}. Always ~~schizoid~~ yet fully
integrated, the hyper-texted body swallows its modem, cuts its wired
connections to the information highway, and becomes its own
system-operating software, combining and remutating the surrounding data
storm into new virtualities. And why not? [Human flesh no longer exists,
except as an incept of the wireless world. Refuse, then, nostalgia for
the surpassed past ofremaindered flesh, and hyper-text your way to the
(World Wide) Webbed body: the body that actually dances on its own data
organs]{.underline}, sees with multi-media graphical interface screens,
makes new best tele-friends on the MOO, writes electronic poetry on the
disappearing edges of video, sound, and text integrators, and insists on
going beyond the tedious world of binary divisions to the new
cyber-mathematics of FITS. [The hyper-texted body, then, is the
precursor of a new world of multi-media politics, **fractalized
economics, incept personalities, and (cybernetically) interfaced
relationships**.]{.underline} After all, why should the virtual class
monopolize digital reality? It only wants to suppress the creative
possibilities ofvirtualization, privileging instead the tendencies of
technotopia towards new and more vicious forms of
cyber-authoritarianism. The virtual class only wants to subordinate
digital reality to the will to capitalism. The hyper-texted body
responds to the challenge of virtualization by making itself a monstrous
double: pure virtuality/pure flesh. Consequently, [our telematic future:
the wireless body on the Net as a sequenced chip microprogrammed by the
virtual class for purposes of (its) maximal profitability, or the
wireless body as the leading-edge of critical subjectivity in the
twenty-first century.]{.underline} If the virtual class is the
post-historical successor to the early bourgeoisie of primitive
capitalism, then the hyper-texted body is the Internet equivalent of the
Paris Commune: anarchistic, utopian,, and in full revolt against the
suppression of the general (tele-)human possibilities of the Net in
favor of the specific (monetary) interests of the virtual class. Always
already the past to the future of the hyper-texted body, the virtual
class is the particular interest that must be overcome by the
hyper-texted body of data trash if the Net is to be gatewayed by soft
ethics

### Debate Shapes Subjectivity

#### The way we play the game of debate matters -- the choice of arguments, the languages we use, and the connections we make inside the space all implicates debaters as subjects

and social theory at the Department of Social Sciences. He has been a
visiting researcher at UC Berkeley, "Network concepts in social theory:
Foucault and cybernetics", European Journal of Social Theory, 17

[Cyberneticians believed that this 'old' world view increasingly fails
to grasp the growing complexity of the world.]{.underline} Therefore,
they called for a new way of thinking, a 'new world view' (e.g. Ackoff,
1979, p. 96). The polemic call for a new mind-set that follows from the
narrative of rising complexity survives in Foucault's writings (e.g.
Foucault, 1994, IV, p. 108) and in nowadays rhetoric of network theory
and network governance (e.g. Eggers, 2008, p. 28; Raworth, 2017). To
overcome the 'old', 'insufficient' models, early cybernetician W. Ross
Ashby (1956, p. 1) already proclaimed a revolutionary shift towards an
operational epistemology that disposes of the ontology inherent in
humanism and mechanics by switching the attention from what to how and
from essence to doing: '[Cybernetics \[ \... \] does not ask "**what is
this thing?" but "what does it do**?"]{.underline}' (original emphasis).

For developing this operational approach, cyberneticians invented a
range of concepts that are abstract enough to deal with any assembly of
elements and to model how these elements may connect to do something
(Beer, 1959, 1967, pp. 9--10). [Presenting 'connectivity' as the core
idea of cybernetics, Stafford Beer once advanced five models of
connectivity in a single paragraph -- machines, systems, networks,
diagram and electric circuits:]{.underline}

[A machine is a system, a set of points joined together by certain
specified relationships. Therefore we may set up as its model a simple
network. \[ \...\] The lines by which these dots are connected reveal
the possible modes in which the system can operate. \[ \...\] A
schematic diagram \[ \...\] can obviously be drawn \[ \...\]. This
diagram will bear a marked resemblance to any representation of an
electric circuit]{.underline}. (Beer, 1967, p. 95, original emphasis)

Beer's explanation illustrates that [cybernetics defined a set of models
to conceptualize **connectivity**, in which **one model is used to
explain another model**, creating a paradigm to describe reality: an
assembly of elements is like a system, is like a network, is like a
diagram and so on]{.underline}. In that manner, the apparatus of
cybernetics encompasses graphical models (flow charts, diagrams, esp.
circuit diagrams), material models (machines and computers), conceptual
models (network, system) and mathematical models (matrices).1 Finally,
and despite their critique of rational choice theory, [cyberneticians
adopted the **model of games, strategy and tactics**, because it enabled
them to describe connectivity and complexity from the perspective of
actors without conceptualizing them in humanistic terms (Dupuy, 2000,
pp. 61--62).]{.underline}

[As the adoption of game-theoretical metaphors illustrates, the
different models have their own strengths and weaknesses. While the
concept of a system is very abstract, allowing for an application to any
arbitrary assembly of elements, networks and diagrams are much more
intelligible in describing the idea of connectivity]{.underline}.
Because of that, they also help to understand two general
epistemological premises of cybernetic modelling. First, [there is a
multiplicity of **interdependent relationships that condition each
other**. The opportunities of an element a to connect with another
element b are **influenced by the connections among the elements c, d
and e,** as well as the chosen '**strategy' of element a will influence
the opportunities of the elements c, d and e**.]{.underline} Secondly[,
the complexity is even higher as there is also a relationship between
actualized and potential connections]{.underline}. The diagram, for
instance, demonstrates that [some connecting lines between the elements
are active in each moment, whereas others are inactive but could have
been chosen or might be chosen at a different point in time. What we can
observe, therefore, is neither the essence of a thing nor the identity
of a person, but only **one possibility actualized at given
moment.**]{.underline}

[Here lies a radical consequence of shifting the attention from essence
to doing]{.underline}, which was finally explicated by second-order
cybernetics: [Systems or networks only exist in doing, in processing, in
reproducing their elements and their relations in real]{.underline}-time
(e.g. Maturana & Varela, 1980). Exploring these processes of ordering,
cybernetics adopted the concepts of emergence and evolution.
'[Emergence' means that some pattern appears as the elements in a
network **relate to each other**]{.underline}. This emergent order and
its possibilities are not intended; they are simply an effect of
simultaneous coordination in the network. Yet, as [the **relations
reproduce themselves in response to changes in the network and in its
environment**, the pattern of the network transforms -- which is called
'evolution']{.underline}. In contrast to stable identities that develop
coherently over time, [emergence and evolution are erratic,
unintentional and irreducible to former formations.]{.underline}
Second-order cybernetics thus undermined modern theories of identity and
linear history alike.

A new concept of 'governance': Circularity, self-regulation, diversity

In line with their categorical rejection of Newtonian mechanics and
ontological philosophy, [cybernetics also came to refuse linear-causal
and mechanistic concepts of steering, in particular hierarchical forms
of organization, command-and-control approaches and central planning.
Cybernetics thought of those models of regulation as 'primitive' and
'naı¨ve']{.underline} (Beer, 1967, p. 21), [because they are based on a
reductionist idea of causality and imply that systems can be steered
intentionally and hierarchically]{.underline}. While this critique
targeted the models of modern science (not political decision-making),
some cyberneticians argued that the 'old' rationality also yields
insufficient concepts of government and power. According to Beer (1967,
p. 21), for instance, those concepts still dominate post-war societies
and simply identify control with coercion. In either case,
cyberneticians believed that in refusing such simplistic models
cybernetics would offer a new, more accurate understanding of control.

The cybernetic concept of control (or regulation) entertains two
fundamental shifts. On the one hand, it maintains that [regulation is a
universal and ubiquitous phenomenon. While there are no systems (and no
societies) without regulation, regulation rarely takes the form of
coercion or linear causality. This is because complex systems are
'highly differentiated', which prevents them from being easily steered
from a control centre. Rather, the interdependent elements in a network
**regulate themselves via mutual influence**. Each element in a system
is shaped by connecting processes and, at the same time, it shapes those
processes by **redirecting the flow of communication**. In other words,
cybernetics argued that regulation is but the name for the circular
processes of communication and]{.underline} coordination (Beer, 1959).

To model circularity, early cyberneticians introduced the term
'feedback' (Rosenblueth et al., 1943). It described that [a system uses
its output as its input. Early cybernetics started from observing
systems that minimize the difference of its actual output to a specified
goal (negative feedback). This focus on quasi-teleological or purposive
mechanisms of goal-attainment, however, soon was
criticized]{.underline}. First, Ashby argued that complex 'homeostatic'
systems would randomly seek their own viable patterns, rather than to
orient towards a given goal (Kline, 2015, pp. 52--53). Then,
second-order cybernetics developed this thought even further by arguing
that input and output are not even objective terms. Instead, [what
counts as input is determined by the processes inside the system: 'an
organism does not **receive "information" as something transmitted to
it, rather, as a circularly organised system it interprets perturbations
as being**]{.underline} **[informative']{.underline}** (Scott, 2004, p.
1369).

This conceptual clarification radicalized cybernetics' idea of control
as self-organization. First-order approaches already argued that [the
elements of the networks regulate themselves by their own '**language'**
(Beer, 1959, p. 5) or 'codes' (Ashby, 1956, p. 140). To generate
resonance inside a system, you **must connect to those codes rather than
to exercise command**. But second-order cybernetics was even more rigid.
According to them, the environment of a system is only 'noise' until the
systems selects on which turbulences in the stream of noise it is going
to act]{.underline} (Clarke, 2009; von Foerster, 1984). Because there
are so many connections and co-dependencies in a network (and in a
network of networks), systems are completely self-organized. Complexity
and selforganization go hand in hand.

It is obvious by now that these 'governance' concepts are descriptive
and normative. The descriptive aspect is that (according to cybernetics)
complex systems have internal processes that are highly differentiated
and flexible, which allows them to deal with massive amounts of
complexity and contingency in their environment. This observation is
famously stated by Ashby's 'law of requisite variety' (1956, pp.
202--213). It is, however, easily turned into a normative statement: If
you do not want to undermine highly complex systems, command-and-control
approaches are the wrong way to go. [Complex systems depend on
diversity, flexibility and self-regulation, because they allow them to
innovate, experiment and 'design' new answers in response to a highly
volatile environment. Here, cybernetics has an **inherent link to
aesthetics and style**]{.underline} (Ackoff, 1979, p. 101), [as those
answers are **not 'the one best way'** (as searched for by rational
choice approaches) but **only one 'viable' way** found through the
creativity that is unlocked by diversity and
self-regulation]{.underline}. Cybernetics, thus, offered a theory of
difference that undermined concepts of ontological identity, economic
rationality and political integration.

### Treeness Poem

[[I once knew]{.underline}]{.mark} an artist

actually [[a Princess]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[who loved "**treeness**"]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[**but not trees**,]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[flowerness]{.underline}**

[but not **flowers**,]{.underline}

**[[greenness]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[but not grass,]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[[humanity]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[but not people]{.underline}]{.mark}**

She had all the money in the world

[[She was the **Princess of the digital woods**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[One day she]{.mark} awoke]{.underline}

[and [decided she wanted]{.mark} to make]{.underline}

[[the art]{.mark} of "treeness"]{.underline}

[the [sounds]{.mark} of treeness]{.underline}

[the **[codes]{.mark}** of treeness]{.underline}

[the [interfaces]{.mark} of treeness]{.underline}

[the [soft images of treeness]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[So she gathered in her]{.mark} new age [electronic
court]{.mark}]{.underline}

all the most famous artists in the kingdom

[[the best]{.mark} **composers and [designers and
programmers]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[When they were assembled]{.mark} there,]{.underline}

[[the Princess came down from her wired throne]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[and said: "**GIVE ME TREENESS**]{.mark}"]{.underline}

[[So the artists]{.mark} went back to their studios]{.underline}

[and [began to have **visions of treeness**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In early spring,

just as the leaves were budding

on the trees

[[they returned]{.mark} to the electronic court of the
Princess]{.underline}

[[with **wires** and]{.underline}]{.mark} multi-media [**[graphical
interfaces]{.mark}**,]{.underline}

MIDI [[processors]{.mark}, digital scans, [recombinant
images,]{.mark}]{.underline}

[**[hard disks, ram, device-drivers]{.mark}**,]{.underline}

[[and 3D accelerators]{.mark}, just **[oozing with
treeness]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[And [the Princess said]{.mark}:]{.underline}

['[This is good. You have discovered]{.mark}]{.underline} with my
guidance

[[**true treeness**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[But we must take our true treeness]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[to the]{.mark} oldest tree in the woods]{.underline}

[the [wise old oak tree".]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[And so they]{.mark} did]{.underline}

[They **[hard-wired the old oak tree]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[Soon]{.mark},]{.underline}

[[sounds and images]{.mark} and texts of true treeness]{.underline}

[[became]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[digital sap]{.underline}]{.mark} of
the old oak tree.

[[But what **sounded good** at the]{.mark} digital
[court]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[sounded **horrid** in the woods]{.mark}]{.underline}

kitschy and silly

whimpy, foolish, and sorry

[[Because]{.mark}]{.underline}

[between true treeness and the trees]{.underline}

[between soft(ware) oak and hard oak]{.underline}

between dry codes and the organic tree

between the Princess and her fabulous dreams

there was oak wetware - an interface problem:

For [[no one asked the oak tree]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[if it **liked** digital codes for sap]{.mark}]{.underline}

computer networks for branches

pixel leaves

a recombinant memory of seasonal changes or,

What is the the sound of a falling oak in a digital forest

if no microminions are around?

[[The Princess was angry]{.mark}]{.underline}

[looking up at the old oak tree, [she screamed:]{.mark}]{.underline}

['**[WHERE IS MY TREENESS?"]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[["You can't buy treeness with money]{.mark}, [my
Princess,"]{.mark}]{.underline}

said the old oak tree.

[["**To find true treeness, you must look to the
trees**!"]{.mark}]{.underline}
