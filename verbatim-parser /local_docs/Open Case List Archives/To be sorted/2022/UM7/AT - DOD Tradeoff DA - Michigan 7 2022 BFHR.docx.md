[The **[House approved]{.mark} sweeping [defense]{.mark}** policy
legislation [on Thursday]{.mark} that marks the **second straight** year
[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} [**and** Republicans]{.mark}
[endorsed]{.mark} significant **increases** to President Joe Biden's
[Pentagon spending]{.mark} plan]{.underline}. [The **[\$839
billion]{.mark}** National Defense Authorization Act, approved in a
329-101 vote, is \$[37 billion **more than**]{.mark} the administration
[sought]{.mark} in military spending]{.underline}. On top of the budget,
the bill also rebukes several of Biden's national security plans.
Members maintained a nuclear cruise missile the administration planned
to scrap, hampered F-16 sales to Turkey and limited the number of
aircraft and ships the Pentagon can retire. In a bipartisan blowout, 180
Democrats and 149 Republicans joined forces to pass legislation, which
authorizes Pentagon spending levels and sets overarching military
policy. "It is the definition of a bipartisan bill," said Rep. Mike
Rogers of Alabama, [the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee.
It includes billions for more aircraft and ships than the Pentagon
sought, following a bipartisan **[vote]{.mark}** by the House Armed
Services Committee **[to raise]{.mark}** [the bill]{.mark}'s price tag
**[by \$37 billion]{.mark}**. Republicans and a sizable number of
Democrats saw Biden's request --- already a \$30 billion increase from
the current year --- as not enough to keep up with runaway inflation and
match challenges posed by China and Russia.]{.underline} The final
Pentagon topline will have to be hammered out by House and Senate
leaders in a compromise defense bill. [And [lawmakers]{.mark} must also
[pass a]{.mark} spending [bill]{.mark} that [makes the]{.mark} [increase
a reality]{.mark}.]{.underline} Lawmakers this week slugged it out over
the size of the Pentagon budget. [[The House]{.mark}
[rejected]{.mark}]{.underline} a push [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[progressive]{.underline}** [Reps]{.mark}. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) and
Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) [to revert the bill]{.mark} to Biden's
[original]{.mark} \$802 billion [request]{.mark}, though most Democrats
backed the effort. House Armed Services Chair Adam
[[Smith]{.underline}]{.mark} (D-Wash.) [[unsuccessfully
fought]{.underline}]{.mark} against increasing the topline during a June
committee markup. He backed the progressive push to slash the topline by
\$37 billion, arguing Biden's budget level is sufficient to meet the
military's needs. "It's not like we aren't spending money if we stick to
the president's budget," Smith said. "I think that's the number we
should stick to." Biden's quest to sell F-16 fighters to Turkey also
suffered a setback at the hands of Democrats, as the House approved an
[amendment that added hurdles to the jet sale to the NATO
ally](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/14/house-adds-roadblock-to-bidens-quest-to-sell-u-s-fighter-jets-to-turkey-00045825)
amid concerns about its purchase of Russian weapons, violation of
neighboring countries' territory and human rights concerns. The measure
was adopted 244-179, with 184 Democrats backing the proposal. If the
provision becomes law, [[Biden]{.mark} will have to [certify]{.mark}
that the sale [is **critical** to U.S. national
security]{.mark}.]{.underline} Progressives suffered another blow by the
inclusion of funding to continue the development of a sea-launched
nuclear cruise missile, a program the White House sought to kill. But
lawmakers added guardrails on the weapon by requiring an analysis of
alternatives and the declassification of the Pentagon's Nuclear Posture
Review before funding can be freed up. Most contentious issues that
could have broken up the bill's bipartisan coalition were kept off the
floor, most notably a [progressive-led
effort](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/08/progressives-abortion-ndaa-roevwade-00044703)
to expand troops' access to abortions at military medical facilities.
Still, Democrats muscled through some of their priorities. The House
narrowly approved a provision from Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.)
that grants the mayor of the District of Columbia the same control over
its National Guard that governors of states have, whereas the city's
Guard powers are currently controlled by the president. The amendment
was approved by the House after failing in the Armed Services Committee.
Democrats also voted to repeal the 2002 Iraq War authorization, a
post-9/11 presidential power that authorized military force with
Congress' approval. Similar proposals have passed the House but haven't
yet seen action in the Senate, despite Senate Majority Leader Chuck
Schumer claiming the move was a priority. Other proposals with no
connection to defense were wrapped into the bill. Rep. Ed Perlmutter
(D-Colo.) won inclusion of his legislation to allow cannabis businesses
to access the banking system. A bipartisan proposal from Reps. Mikie
Sherrill (D-N.J.), Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and
others were included to eliminate the federal sentencing disparity
between drug offenses for powder and crack cocaine[[. A]{.mark}
heightened [budget]{.mark} topline [saw lawmakers]{.mark} propose
[purchasing more aircraft and ships]{.mark}]{.underline}, and prevent
the military from retiring many older weapons as a money-saving move.
The bill authorizes 13 new warships, adding five ships the Navy didn't
request --- an extra Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, another
Constellation-class frigate, another fleet oiler and two expeditionary
medical ships. It also requires the Navy to keep five of the nine
littoral combat ships it sought to retire. Lawmakers turned back a push
by Smith to allow the service to scrap all nine hulls. The bill also
authorizes 64 F-35 fighter jets, three more than the Pentagon sought
across the military services. [[Lawmakers approved \$**354
million**]{.mark} to procure [three more]{.mark} F-35C
[carrier]{.mark}-based [jets]{.mark} for the Navy.]{.underline}
