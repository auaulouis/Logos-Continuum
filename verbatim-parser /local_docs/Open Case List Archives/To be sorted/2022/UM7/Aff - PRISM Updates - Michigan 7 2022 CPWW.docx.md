**Apathy is a feature of our time -- time governance has created a
simulation where it's easier to imagine the end of the world than the
end of capitalism. Change is possible, but not in the current framework
which twists us dry**

**Fisher 9** (Mark Fisher, experiencing the world, writer, theorist,
teacher, k-punk. 2009, Zero Books, \"Capitalist Realism: Is There No
Alternative?\", Chapter 1: It's easier to imagine the end of the world
than the end of capitalism)//gideon

We do not need to wait for Children of Men\'s near-future to arrive to
see this transformation of culture into museum pieces. The power of
[capitalist realism derives]{.underline} in part [from the way
that]{.underline} **[capitalism]{.underline}** subsumes and **[consumes
all]{.underline}** of **[previous history]{.underline}**: one effect of
[its \'system of equivalence\']{.underline} which [can assign all
cultural objects]{.underline}, whether they are religious iconography,
pornography, or Das Kapital, [a monetary value]{.underline}. [Walk
around the British Museum]{.underline}, where [you see objects torn from
their Iifeworlds and assembled]{.underline} as if on the deck of some
Predator spacecraft, and you have a powerful image of this process at
work. In the conversion of practices and rituals into merely aesthetic
objects, the [beliefs of previous cultures are]{.underline} objectively
[ironized]{.underline}, [transformed into artifacts]{.underline}.
[Capitalist realism is]{.underline} therefore not a particular type of
realism; it is more like [realism in itself]{.underline}. As Marx and
Engels themselves observed in The Communist Manifesto, \[[Capital\] has
drowned]{.underline} the most heavenly ecstasies of [religious
fervor]{.underline}, of [chivalrous enthusiasm]{.underline}, of
[philistine sentimentalism]{.underline}, in the icy water of
[egotistical calculation]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} has [resolved
personal worth into exchange value]{.underline}, [and in place
of]{.underline} the numberless [indefeasible chartered
freedoms]{.underline}, has [set up]{.underline} that single,
unconscionable freedom - Free Trade. In one word, for
[exploitation]{.underline}, [veiled by religious and political
illusions]{.underline}, [it has substituted]{.underline} **[naked,
shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.]{.underline}** Capitalism is
what is left [when beliefs have collapsed]{.underline} at the level of
ritual or symbolic elaboration, and [all that is left is the
consumer-spectator]{.underline}, trudging through the ruins and the
relics. Yet this turn from belief to aesthetics, from engagement to
spectatorship, is held to be one of the virtues of capitalist realism.
In claiming, as Badiou puts it, to have\' delivered us from the \"fatal
abstractions\" inspired by the \"ideologies of the past\"\', [capitalist
realism presents]{.underline} itself as [a shield protecting us
from]{.underline} the perils posed by [belief itself]{.underline}. The
attitude of [ironic distance proper to postmodern capitalism is supposed
to immunize us against the seductions of fanaticism]{.underline}.
[Lowering our expectations]{.underline}, we are told, [is a]{.underline}
[small price to pay for being protected from terror and
totalitarianism]{.underline}. \'We live in a contradiction,\' Badiou has
observed: [a brutal state of affairs]{.underline}, profoundly
[inegalitarian]{.underline} - [where all existence is evaluated in terms
of money alone]{.underline} - is [presented]{.underline} to us [as
ideal]{.underline}. To justify their conservatism, the
[partisans]{.underline} of the established order [cannot]{.underline}
really [call it ideal]{.underline} or wonderful. So
[instead]{.underline}, [they]{.underline} have [decided to say that all
the rest is horrible.]{.underline} [Sure]{.underline}, they say, **[we
may not live in]{.underline}** a condition of perfect
**[Goodness]{.underline}**. **[But]{.underline}** we\'re lucky that
**[we don\'t live in]{.underline}** a condition of
**[Evil]{.underline}**. Our **[democracy is not perfect]{.underline}**.
**[But it\'s better than]{.underline}** the **[bloody
dictatorships]{.underline}**. **[Capitalism is unjust]{.underline}**.
**[But]{.underline}** it\'s **[not criminal like
Stalinism]{.underline}**. **[We let millions of Africans die of
AIDS]{.underline}**, **[but we don\'t make racist nationalist
declarations like Milosevic]{.underline}**. **[We kill Iraqis
with]{.underline}** our **[airplanes]{.underline}**, **[but we don\'t
cut their throats with machetes]{.underline}** like they do in Rwanda,
etc. The \'realism\' here is analogous to the deflationary perspective
of a depreSSive who believes that any positive state, any hope, is a
dangerous illusion. In their account of capitalism, surely the most
impressive since Marx\'s, Deleuze and Guattari describe capitalism as a
kind of dark potentiality which haunted all previous social systems.
Capital, they argue, is the \'unnamable Thing\', the abomination, which
primitive and feudal societies \'warded off in advance\'. When it
actually arrives, [capitalism brings]{.underline} with it a massive
[desacralization of culture]{.underline}. It is a system which is no
longer governed by any transcendent Law; on the contrary, [it dismantles
all]{.underline} such [codes]{.underline}, [only to re-install them on
an ad hoc basis.]{.underline} **[The limits of capitalism are not fixed
by fiat]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline} [defined]{.underline} (and
redefined) [pragmatically and improvisationally]{.underline}. [This
makes capitalism]{.underline} very much like the Thing in John
Carpenter\'s film of the same name: [a monstrous, infinitely plastic
entity, capable of metabolizing and absorbing anything with which it
comes into contact.]{.underline} Capital, Deleuze and Guattari says, is
a \'motley painting of everything that ever was\'; a strange hybrid of
the ultra-modern and the archaic. In the years since Deleuze and
Guattari wrote the two volumes of their Capitalism And Schizophrenia, it
has seemed as if the deterritorializing impulses of capitalism have been
confined to finance, leaving culture presided over by the forces of
reterritorialization. This malaise, the feeling that there is nothing
new, is itself nothing new of course. [We find ourselves at
the]{.underline} notorious [\'end of history\']{.underline} trumpeted by
Francis Fukuyama after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Fukuyama\'s thesis
[that history has climaxed with liberal capitalism]{.underline} may have
been widely derided, but it [is accepted]{.underline}, even assumed, [at
the]{.underline} level of the [cultural unconscious.]{.underline} It
should be remembered, though, that even when Fukuyama advanced it, the
idea that history had reached a \'terminal beach\' was not merely
triumphalist. [Fukuyama warned that his radiant city would be
haunted]{.underline}, but he thought its specters would be Nietzschean
rather than Marxian. Some of Nietzsche\'s most prescient pages are those
in which he describes the \'oversaturation of an age with history\'.
\'It leads an age into a dangerous mood of irony in regard to itself\',
he wrote in Untimely Meditations, I and subsequently into the even more
dangerous mood of cynicism\', in which \'cosmopolitan fingering\', a
detached spectatorialism, replaces engagement and involvement. This is
the condition of Nietzsche\'s Last Man, who has seen everything, but is
decadently enfeebled precisely by this excess of (self) awareness.

**Neoliberal self-replication over-codes the public sphere and the
resolution by commanding inward turns to obscures collective
struggle---this doesn't require engagement with the topic as a singlular
reading, but instead opens up the opportunity for pluralist discourse
and contestation over multiple articulations. The impact is the
solidification of inequality---only shifting interpersonal relations
towards coordinated action and forefronting contestation, rather than
atomization can solve and reclaim the potential for activism**

[Neoliberalism]{.underline} also [obfuscates]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [means
for]{.underline} **[redressing
inequality]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[mobilizing
diversity]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} [weakening]{.underline} [relations
among people and
devaluing]{.underline} **[coordinated]{.underline}** [action]{.underline}. [For
publics and]{.underline} [counterpublics alike,
the]{.underline} [prospect
of]{.underline} **[efficacious]{.underline}** **[public]{.underline}** **[engagement]{.underline}** [has]{.underline} long [depended
on]{.underline} **[bolstering]{.underline}** **[interpersonal
relations]{.underline}** and empowering coordinated action. John [Dewey
regarded]{.underline} **[perceptions of mutual
implication]{.underline}** [in the conduct and consequences of human
affairs as forming the]{.underline} **[basis of a
public]{.underline}**. [When
perceived,]{.underline} [consequences]{.underline} do not exert a
mechanistic pull on the formation of publics,
but [facilitate]{.underline} [transformative
action]{.underline} [by]{.underline} [individuals,
who]{.underline} **["reflect upon"
their]{.underline}** **[connections]{.underline}** with one another[:
"Each acts, in so far as the connection is known, in view of the
connection]{.underline}."13 [Public engagement
draws]{.underline} [importantly]{.underline} [on]{.underline} [ideas]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [practices
of]{.underline} **[mutual]{.underline}** standing
and **[connection]{.underline}**, [suggesting]{.underline}, for
example, [that]{.underline} [people]{.underline} [may
jointly]{.underline} [benefit]{.underline} [from]{.underline} [the
alleviation of a problem]{.underline}. [Or that people
may]{.underline} **[work together]{.underline}** [to address
issues]{.underline} and concerns [in the]{.underline} [name
of]{.underline} **[fairness]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[justice]{.underline}**. [Or
that people may work together to achieve]{.underline} **[shared
goals]{.underline}** [that improve collective well-being]{.underline}.
Plainly put, **[public engagement]{.underline}** [draws on the promise
of a public good, which
neoliberalism]{.underline} **[disavows]{.underline}** [through]{.underline} its [strict
reliance on]{.underline} **[a narrow individualism]{.underline}**. As I
argue in this essay, [this]{.underline} [notion of a public good
does]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [refer
to]{.underline} **[specific, bounded content]{.underline}**; [it does
not demand]{.underline} **[shared experiences]{.underline}**; [it does
not]{.underline} [aim
for]{.underline} **[consensus]{.underline}**. [Rather,
this]{.underline} [public
good]{.underline} [constitutes]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [practice of
articulating]{.underline} **[mutual]{.underline}** [standing
and]{.underline} **[connection]{.underline}**, [recognizing that people
can solve problems]{.underline} and achieve goals---and struggle for
justice---[through coordinated action]{.underline}. **[In
a]{.underline}** **[networked public sphere]{.underline}**, [there
is]{.underline} [no singular, universal]{.underline} [public good,
but]{.underline} **[multiple]{.underline}** [articulations]{.underline} [of
a public good]{.underline}. Both the bourgeois public sphere and
neoliberalism seek to promote singularity over multiplicity: the former
by asserting the supposedly unique capacity of the bourgeoisie to
discern a public good, and the latter by disaggregating a public good
into individuals who can only act alone. In these ways, both [the
bourgeois public sphere and neoliberalism privilege established
interests and raise obstacles for]{.underline} **[a vibrant critical
publicity]{.underline}**. I develop my argument over three main sections
in this essay. In the first section, I explicate how a networked public
sphere draws on a dynamic public good that calls attention to
relationships and connects people in different ways as a force for
public engagement. Enlivened through relationships, a networked public
sphere may enable the productive power of difference and create
opportunities for addressing inequalities. In the second section, I
critique a neoliberal public built around the atomistic individual and
guided by the principle of competition. Flattening difference and
discounting inequality, a neoliberal public assumes that everyone can
adopt the position of homo oeconomicus. In the third section, I discuss
the prospects for resistance to a neoliberal public through the
coordinated action of networked locals. Using the example of public
education, I discuss how local advocates may work together to rebuild
and expand connections across difference in a networked public sphere. A
networked public sphere and a public good Defying an essentialist and
static framework, [a public good
is]{.underline} **[dynamic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**mobile**,
operating at different levels of society, and open
to]{.underline} **[contestation]{.underline}** and reformulation. [A
public good does not function as a container that holds
a]{.underline} **[particular]{.underline}** [set of
values,]{.underline} **[principles]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[issues,]{.underline}** [although
some publics may seek to define a public good in exclusionary
terms.]{.underline} [A]{.underline} [public good does not refer to
a]{.underline} **[discrete body of
knowledge]{.underline}**, [an]{.underline} **[established]{.underline}** group
of **[institutions]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} **[a coherent
synthesis]{.underline}** of public opinion. [Rather, a public good
circulates in society]{.underline}, [connecting
people's]{.underline} perceptions and [actions
to]{.underline} their [relationships]{.underline} **[with
each]{.underline}** [other and the worlds they
inhabit]{.underline}. **[It informs the ways that people make engagement
meaningful]{.underline}**. [It is a network
of]{.underline} [**discursive**,]{.underline} [**embodied**,
and]{.underline} [**material relationships**.]{.underline} Affirming
this dynamism, public sphere scholars may productively conceptualize a
public good as a practice that draws on relationships within and among
publics and counterpublics to connect people in different ways. [When
advocates articulate a public good,]{.underline} [they appeal to people
to]{.underline} **[imagine]{.underline}** their **[connections with
others]{.underline}** in particular ways, [to perceive connections that
may
facilitate]{.underline} **[coordinated]{.underline}** **[action]{.underline}** [towards
addressing problems, issues, and goals]{.underline}. Insofar as publics
do not reference naturally occurring associations, [relationships within
and among publics have to be]{.underline} **[constructed]{.underline}**.
People must perceive themselves as members of a community, allies in a
struggle for justice, citizens implicated in the actions of their
governments. Along these lines, Dewey distinguishes between the brute
fact of human association and the consciously cultivated bonds of
community. Humans are born and live among others, but community "is
emotionally, intellectually, consciously sustained." Coordinated action
implies a collective subject, a "we" who should do something. Dewey
holds that "'we' and 'our' exist only when the consequences of combined
action are perceived and become an object of desire and effort."14
Michael Warner offers an attenuated version of this argument in holding
that "a public is constituted through mere attention." Warner's position
productively draws attention to the constructed character of publics
through "active intake." However, he limits this activity in at least
two ways: first, Warner emphasizes identification over and against the
possibility of dissociation. He writes to audience of his book: "If you
are reading this, or hearing it or seeing it or present for it, you are
part of this public." Yet this insistence conflates awareness and
affiliation, which leaves no agency for someone who encounters something
they find objectionable, or someone who may be aware of discourses that
exclude them. Second, Warner discounts dialogic models of publics as
placing too much emphasis on "polemic" and "argument." Instead, he
privileges the circulation of texts, which appears to compel a choice
among modes of communication and limits the means of constructing
publics[. A public good operates in a networked public sphere by
explicitly or implicitly calling attention to relationships,
constructing or reconstructing]{.underline} [relationships, and drawing
on these relationships as a force for]{.underline} **[public
engagement]{.underline}**. The operation of a public good informs both
publicity and counterpublicity. On this point, Fraser observes that
counterpublics often direct their public engagement to "the appropriate
boundaries of the public sphere," namely, shared perceptions of what
constitutes public and private issues. She cites as an example the
efforts of counterpublic actors to reframe domestic violence as a public
issue. In this discussion, Fraser does not reject public appeals, but
"naturally given, a priori boundaries." Indeed, she underscores the
value of appealing to a public good in writing that "[democratic
publicity]{.underline} [requires]{.underline}  ...  [opportunities]{.underline} for
minorities [to]{.underline} **[convince others]{.underline}** [that what
in the past was not public in the sense of being a matter of common
concern should]{.underline} now [become so."]{.underline}16 Note
Fraser's [reference to]{.underline} **["convinc\[ing\]
others]{.underline}**," [which]{.underline} [suggests an effort
by]{.underline} [counterpublic]{.underline} [actors to
make]{.underline} **[connections]{.underline}** [and
emphasize]{.underline} **[mutual standing]{.underline}**. This
discursive move resists the assumption that domestic violence is an
issue that only concerns its victims. In this case and others, the
prospects for social change encourage advocates to engage others who may
not have seen themselves as implicated in an issue or problem so that
they may see its wider import. [In another case, focusing on the
contemporary issue
of]{.underline} **[state-condoned]{.underline}** racial **[violence]{.underline}** in
the United States and the civil rights movements that have emerged to
counteract this violence, Sarah Jackson and Brooke Foucault Welles argue
that [counterpublics]{.underline} have [operated with "the express goals
of]{.underline} both [legitimizing and
communicating]{.underline} their [lived realities and pushing the
mainstream public sphere to acknowledge]{.underline} and respond
to [these realities]{.underline}."17 Legitimation, communication, and
acknowledgement all draw on relationships---relationships among
participants in counterpublics as well as relations among publics and
counterpublics. For counterpublic actors, these relationships may
redirect otherwise isolating experiences to connect people who have
suffered police brutality. [Engaging
with]{.underline} like-minded [others]{.underline},
counterpublic [actors
may]{.underline} better [understand]{.underline} their [experiences,
refashion identities]{.underline} from passive victim to capable
agent, [and push for social change]{.underline}. Among publics and
counterpublics, legitimation, communication, and acknowledgment place a
responsibility on wider publics to see their connections to places like
Ferguson and people like Michael Brown. In this sense, counterpublic
actors rejected assertions that the murder of Michael Brown in Ferguson
constituted a confined incident. They instead connected the shooting in
Ferguson to issues of race in the United States, in which all citizens
hold a
stake. [Demonstrating]{.underline} **[dynamism]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[mobility]{.underline}**, [actors]{.underline} [in
a networked public sphere may]{.underline} [articulate a public
good]{.underline} **[variously]{.underline}** [through]{.underline} [multiple]{.underline} **[modes
of]{.underline}** **[engagement]{.underline}**. [This variety indicates
that multiplicity does not attenuate the productive power of a public
good, but may facilitate its functioning in ways that resonate with the
perspectives of actors within and]{.underline} **[across publics and
counterpublics]{.underline}**. For example, as he explicates a vibrant
mode of dissent for democratic deliberation, Robert Ivie discerns a
"[topos
of]{.underline} [complementary]{.underline} [differences]{.underline}"
that [enables dissenters to express "relations
of]{.underline} **[interdependence]{.underline}**" [with
the]{.underline} [people]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [societies they
critique
to]{.underline} **[sustain]{.underline}** **[interaction]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**forestall
violence**.]{.underline} [In maintaining
relationships]{.underline} [amidst]{.underline} **[disagreement]{.underline}**, [dissent
"enhances]{.underline} [democratic]{.underline} [pluralism"]{.underline} [by]{.underline} [questioning]{.underline} ["**that
which is taken for granted**"]{.underline} [as well
as]{.underline} **[bridging "differences]{.underline}** [to
generate]{.underline} **[constructive]{.underline}** **[dialogue
and]{.underline}** [**deliberation**.]{.underline} Beyond deliberation,
people may employ various forms of rhetoric and communication to
recognize mutual standing and facilitate coordinated action.19 Perhaps
through creativity born of struggle, counterpublicity may lend itself to
discursive innovation. Addressing its generative potential, Brouwer
writes that counterpublicity may emerge through "unruly, passionate,
enfleshed, ironic" and other modes of engagement.20 0 Illustrating this
point, Yvonne Slosarski considers how participants in labor protests in
Wisconsin in 2011 enacted alternatives to policymakers' market-oriented
efforts to disempower public employee unions by revoking their rights to
collective bargaining. Although they did not defeat the legislation,
protestors articulated visions of a public good in diverse ways. Besides
traditional means like testifying at public committee hearings,
protestors commenced a weeks-long occupation of the state capitol that
"enacted a vision of communal, participatory democracy." 21 Slosarski
maintains that the occupation emphasized themes of "self-governance,
solidarity, and respect" in the ways that protestors treated, cared for,
and supported each other.22 By constructing and cultivating these
connections, protestors presented alternatives to neoliberal views of
self and society [While neoliberalism
emphasizes]{.underline} **[individuals]{.underline}**, [the
relationships articulated in a public good facilitate complementary
engagements of "I" and "we," of individual and community]{.underline}.
On this basis, individual identity and agency do not arise as autonomous
achievements, but through practices of social construction. One's sense
of self and capacity for action arises in part through interaction with
others. Gerard Hauser discerns in public discourse an intersubjective
relation through which individuals understand their engagement from the
perspective of a shared "we" while maintaining their distinctive
contributions.23 Reciprocally, [development of a collective
identity]{.underline} [and agency]{.underline} [draws on the spirit of
individuals to]{.underline} [**align with others**, to recognize
connections that may enable]{.underline} **[mutually valued
action]{.underline}**. [From particular exchanges to
broader]{.underline} **[engagements]{.underline}**, [Dewey identifies
the]{.underline} **[mediation]{.underline}** of individual
and **[community]{.underline}** [as a key dynamic of
democracy]{.underline}. He holds that [from the standpoint of the
individual, democratic practices and norms facilitate individuals'
equitable participation in the groups to which they belong]{.underline}.
From the standpoint of the community, democracy demands "the liberation
of the potentialities of members of a group in harmony with the
interests and goods which are in common." Yet **[this "common" does not
admit to
a]{.underline}** **[transparent]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[singular
reading]{.underline}**, [since]{.underline} [individuals belong to many
groups, and notions of potentiality and common interests and goods arise
when "different groups interact flexibly and fully
in]{.underline} **[connection]{.underline}** [with other
groups]{.underline}." 24 [Shared purpose arises
through]{.underline} [people's]{.underline} **[engagement]{.underline}** [with
difference]{.underline}, [and the same person may commit themselves to
multiple]{.underline} **[shared purposes]{.underline}** [through their
membership in and interaction with various groups]{.underline}. [By
emphasizing]{.underline} **[relationships]{.underline}**, [the]{.underline} [operation
of a]{.underline} [public good in a
networked]{.underline} [public]{.underline} [sphere may serve
to]{.underline} **[bolster attention to
(in)equality]{.underline}** **[and difference]{.underline}** [by
facilitating]{.underline} **[contestation]{.underline}** [among publics
and counterpublics]{.underline}. Equality and difference themselves
invite relational judgments. We can assess neither in isolation: the
isolated individual imagined in neoliberalism presumably has no
connection to others, thereby rendering moot considerations of equality
and difference. [In contrast, calling on relationships
and]{.underline} [making connections encourages people to think
about]{.underline} [their]{.underline} [relations to others and to
discuss]{.underline} **[differences]{.underline}** [that
may]{.underline} [appear
as]{.underline} **[productive]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[unproductive]{.underline}**,
just and unjust. **[Relationality]{.underline}** [serves as the basis
for a contested, agonistic]{.underline} [spirit]{.underline} [and
practice in a]{.underline} **[networked public
sphere.]{.underline}** [As publics and counterpublics engage, they
emphasize different relationships and construct alternative connections
among people, advancing]{.underline} potentially [competing visions of a
public good and]{.underline} [invigorating the agonism
that]{.underline} Chantal [Mouffe identifies as the "**very condition of
existence" of**]{.underline} democratic **[public
engagement]{.underline}**.25 [Engagement does not only circulate the
perspectives of publics and
counterpublics]{.underline}. **[Even]{.underline}** [in
disagreement,]{.underline} [it may shift the
perspectives]{.underline} [of people who engage each
other]{.underline} [by]{.underline} [raising awareness
and]{.underline} **[situating]{.underline}** their **[views in wider
contexts]{.underline}**. [Relationality and contestation recognize
difference not as a set of essential categories or individual or group
attributes but as varying engagements with others to
offer]{.underline} **[multiple perspectives]{.underline}** [on public
issues and concerns]{.underline}. Iris Marion Young explains that
"because of their social locations, people are attuned to particular
kinds of social meanings and relationships to which others are less
attuned." 26 Engaging diverse perspectives, difference contributes
productively to public discourse, admitting various ways of looking at
issues that would be foreclosed by an emphasis on sameness. Moreover,
conceived in this way, [difference neither fragments nor finishes public
engagement among diverse social actors]{.underline}. Young observes that
"[social perspective consists]{.underline} [in a]{.underline} **[set of
questions]{.underline}**, kinds of experience, and
assumptions **[with]{.underline}** **[which reasoning
begins]{.underline}**, [rather
than]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[conclusions]{.underline}** [drawn]{.underline}."
27 [This]{.underline} [framework]{.underline} **[underscores]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[productive]{.underline}** **[power
of difference]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[coordinated
action]{.underline}** [for a networked public sphere,
which]{.underline} [generates]{.underline} [more]{.underline} **[perspectives]{.underline}** and
tests these perspectives **[through
contestation]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} [ways]{.underline} [that
are]{.underline} **[unavailable]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [isolated
individual.]{.underline} Further, this framework underscores
that [individuals as individuals do not rely
on]{.underline} **[singular]{.underline}** [perspectives]{.underline}:
"since individuals are multiply positioned in complexly structured
societies, individuals interpret the society from a multiplicity of
social group perspectives." 28 In these ways, [a dynamic public good
sustains the vibrancy of a networked public sphere]{.underline}. My
conceptualization of a public good has explicated its dynamism as a
practice that, in drawing on relationships and making connections, also
informs people's perceptions of themselves and others. Yet, structural
conditions in society may enable and constrain this practice, and this
practice may reshape structural conditions. Seeking to draw greater
attention to this aspect of publicity, Brouwer urges scholarship on
counterpublics to attend to resource disparities among actors.
Connecting perception, practice, and structure, he writes if we take the
view that counterpublics emerge from perceptions of oppositionality to
dominant forces, then we should remain attentive to the ways in which
both perceptual and actual disparities of resources inflect
counterpublic activities and counterpublics' relations with other
publics.29 As Brouwer suggests, in direct and indirect ways, resources
mediated through institutions and social arrangements may provide a
basis for action in the public sphere. For instance, [people who
perceive]{.underline} [their]{.underline} [positions in
society]{.underline} [as]{.underline} **[precarious]{.underline}**---depending,
perhaps, on insecure and low-wage employment for their sustenance or
fearful of government surveillance because of their immigration

may call attention to oppressive structures,]{.underline}** and some
publics may rely on alternative structures to change oppressive ones. In
developing her definition of counterpublics, for example, Fraser
references institutions that facilitated feminist counterpublic
engagement: "journals, bookstores, publishing companies, film and video
distribution networks, lecture series, research centers, academic
programs, conferences, conventions, festivals, and local meeting
places." 30 In their explication of a proletarian public sphere, Oskar
Negt and Alexander Kluge address the structures of capitalism and
workers' efforts to change these structures.31 Although a public good
may be conceptualized and practiced to affirm and bolster multiplicity,
some publics and scholars have practiced and conceptualized a public
good to assert singularity. As Young observes, "under conditions of
structural social and economic inequality, the relative power of some
groups often allows them to dominate the definition of a common good in
ways compatible with their experience, perspective, and priorities." 32
Historically, an invocation of universality stood as the constitutive
exclusion of the bourgeois public sphere. As Habermas observed, the
bourgeoisie perpetuated a basic conflation of human being and property
owner: the fully developed bourgeois public sphere was based on the
fictitious identity of the two roles assumed by the privatized
individuals who came together to form a public: the role of property
owners and the role of human beings pure and simple.33 The bourgeoisie
wrongly believed that property owners had achieved an economic autonomy
and freedom that gave them an exclusive perspective on society as a
whole. The bourgeoisie thought that they had obtained a vantage point on
society that could vouchsafe everyone's interests. Critiques of the
bourgeois public sphere have revealed its legitimating discourses as
particularity masquerading as universality.34 From this view, to call
attention to one's own particularity, when this particularity does not
comport with the "universal" bourgeois subject, is to call attention to
oneself as less than a fully autonomous agent. Conceptually, some
scholars have sought to ground a public good in a common content, a
shared set of procedures, or a consensus-driven outcome. For instance,
in his model of deliberative democracy, Joshua Cohen regards the role of
a public good, which he refers to as a common good, as focusing
deliberation on "ways of advancing the aims of each party" to achieving
consensus. A common good thus informs people's motivations and orients
their engagement, since everyone "seeks to arrive at decisions that are
acceptable to all who share the commitment to deliberation." To do this,
people must focus on "appeals to the common good," which implies a
discrete object of discourse.35 Deliberation functions to sort reasons
by separating those that carry general appeal from those that only
warrant particular assent. This model dampens public deliberation and
admits difference only to the extent that it serves an ultimate
consensus. Further, this model attributes a universal motivation to
diverse participants.36 While Cohen subordinates difference to the goal
of consensus, John Rawls fixes lines of public and private by promoting
the idea of public reason as a means of mediating difference in a
pluralistic society. To do so, he effectively distinguishes questions of
justice and the good life. People may answer questions of the good life
by invoking culturally specific worldviews, through which citizens weigh
and organize different values so that "they are compatible with one
another and express an intelligible view of the world." 37 Questions of
the good life concern only those individuals and cultures to whom they
are addressed. In contrast, questions of justice concern all members of
a polity and, as such, demand deliberative procedures accessible to all.
On these occasions, Rawls argues, citizens must draw on "public reason,"
which consists of "substantive principles of justice" and commonly
recognized "guidelines of inquiry." Rawls insists that a "duty of
civility" calls on citizens "to explain to one another on those
fundamental questions how the principles and policies they advocate and
vote for can be supported by the political values of public reason." 38
For Rawls, citizens may fulfill this duty because public reason and its
conception of justice constitute a part of everyone's belief systems,
functioning as a "module" that people may present separately from their
wider beliefs. In articulating his idea of public reason, Rawls draws
strict and impermeable lines between public and private---or, less
"public"---discourse. Further, he ascribes an internally differentiated
reason to citizens and demands that they maintain this division. In the
form of public reason, Rawls imposes a universalized public good, which
contains a discrete content, on a pluralistic society. This is precisely
what a conceptualization of a public good in a networked public sphere
must avoid. Neoliberalism and the public sphere Even as it raises
serious challenges for models and practices of a multiple public
sphere, [neoliberalism does not dispense with publicity]{.underline}.
Indeed, neoliberalism in its various forms circulates among the nodes of
a networked public sphere. [Neoliberalism challenges modes of critical
publicity by aligning publics with its own vision of individuals and
their interactions]{.underline}. Recalling the presumption of a
bourgeois public, **[a neoliberal
public]{.underline}** [disregards]{.underline} **[difference]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[discounts
inequality]{.underline}** [to reassert a singular and universal model of
publicity.]{.underline} To the degree to which it exerts force across a
network, a neoliberal public obfuscates the diversity of the network in
which it circulates. A neoliberal public exhibits distinct qualities and
assumes alternative functions than a networked public sphere operating
with a dynamic public good. To understand this neoliberal public, we
first must recognize that scholars have used the term neoliberalism to
refer to related but multiple developments and objects. Engaging the
wide-ranging contemporary scholarship on the topic, Simon Springer
observes that four prominent versions of neoliberalism circulate in the
literature: neoliberalism as dominant ideology; neoliberalism as policy
framework; neoliberalism as state form; and neoliberalism as mode of
self-governance.39 As Springer notes, these versions may overlap. If we
understand ideology as a set of political beliefs and principles, then
we may discern a form of neoliberalism in the discourse of advocates who
champion the superiority of markets. Yet, this very example lends itself
to a policy program of privatization, and it reimagines the state
through a market model. While the qualities and functions of a
neoliberal public link to these variations, public sphere scholars may
offer a distinctive contribution by considering how neoliberalism, as a
dominant social force, shapes the subjectivities of people who act in
the public sphere as well as their perceived and enacted relations to
one another.40 The figure of an atomized individual stands at the center
of a neoliberal public. In his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom, Milton
Friedman opened with an unequivocal assertion of the place of the
individual: To the free man, the country is the collection of
individuals who compose it, not something over and above them. ... He
recognizes no national purpose except as it is the consensus of the
purposes for which the citizens severally strive.41 In rebuking
"something over and above" individuals, in denying shared purpose,
Friedman gainsaid the existence of coordinated action as anything other
than an infringement on individual prerogative. Whereas public sphere
scholars like Hannah Arendt have discerned a power in human
relationships that "springs up between \[people\] when they act
together," 42 Friedman denied this potentiality. Elected officials, too,
have voiced this individualist orientation. In his first inaugural
address, President Ronald Reagan recast the progressive narrative of the
American Dream "to privilege the individual as the hero, rather than the
community." 43 Like Friedman, Reagan grounded his view of the nation in
individuals, and he did so in celebratory terms. At other times, censure
has replaced celebration when individuals fail to reach their economic
goals, or even economic survivability, since individuals alone bear the
responsibility for their actions. Writing about the circulation of the
"mortgage delinquent" in the 2008 housing market crisis in the United
States, Megan Foley explains that this figure enforced neoliberal
self-discipline by scolding debtors to "grow up, take responsibility,
and repay their loans." At the same time, this figure "minimized the
scope of the mortgage crisis by pinning the blame on 'irresponsible'
individuals who made 'risky' financial decisions." 44 [Just as an
emphasis on]{.underline} [an]{.underline} [atomized individual denies
coordinated action]{.underline}, **[it]{.underline}** **[occludes
structural deficiencies]{.underline}**. [In a neoliberal public
sphere,]{.underline} [individuals]{.underline} [may]{.underline} [exercise]{.underline} [the
fundamental]{.underline} [value
of]{.underline} [**freedom**,]{.underline} [defined]{.underline} generally [as]{.underline} [the
ability]{.underline} [of
individuals]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [act]{.underline} [as they
please]{.underline} **[without]{.underline}** coercion
or **[constraint]{.underline}**, [but narrowly imagined as
the]{.underline} [**freedom of market actors**.]{.underline} [Recalling
a lineage of classical liberalism, Friedman upheld "freedom as the
ultimate goal and the individual as the ultimate entity in
society]{.underline}." 45 [Freedom]{.underline} [supposedly brought
limitless
possibilities]{.underline}---[individuals]{.underline} [could]{.underline} **[decide]{.underline}** best
how they would live their lives; [what
they]{.underline} **[valued]{.underline}**; [with whom they
would]{.underline} **[interact]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[how]{.underline}**.
However, in flattening society in the image of the market, Friedman and
other neoliberals restricted freedom to the freedom of market
actors.46 [Democratic connotations of]{.underline} [freedom as
self-rule]{.underline} [or "participation in rule by the
demos]{.underline}," notes Brown, [gave "way]{.underline} [to
comportment with a market]{.underline} **[instrumental
rationality]{.underline}** [that radically constrains both choices and
ambitions]{.underline}. ... No longer is there an open question of how
to craft the self." 47 In this
shift, [freedom]{.underline} also [dissociates from
other]{.underline} democratic [values like]{.underline} equality
and **[justice]{.underline}**. Illuminating the implications of this
move, Friedman contrasted the virtuous action of the free individual
against the paternalistic and coercive actions of the state. Any effort
by governing institutions to seek equality and pursue justice could
never be genuine because it required the imposition of state control on
the free will of individuals. As Paul Turpin notes, Friedman presented a
stark choice: either citizens could defend freedom or submit to state
control and, ultimately, totalitarianism.48 However, as I discuss below,
Friedman and other neoliberals supported state action when they regarded
it as serving the market. [Unable to draw on]{.underline} **[coordinated
action]{.underline}** for social change, [the neoliberal public subject
only may act as an individual to change oneself in the image of the
market]{.underline}. In this manner, [neoliberalism
redirects]{.underline} [social]{.underline} [concerns]{.underline} **[inward]{.underline}**.
Operating as a competitive market actor does not occur naturally;
rather, [individuals]{.underline} [must]{.underline} [develop]{.underline} [their]{.underline} **[competitiveness]{.underline}**.
Pierre Dardot and Christian Laval explain that the [neoliberal subject
must work on oneself constantly "to survive
competition]{.underline}." **[Success requires consideration of one's
activities as "an investment]{.underline}**, a cost calculation. The
economy becomes a personal discipline." 49 Dardot and Laval maintain
that the self-improvement of the neoliberal subject does not constitute
an exercise in delayed gratification; one does not mold oneself as a
market actor to accumulate the financial means for self-fulfillment in a
non-market activity later in life. Work appears as its own end.
Neoliberalism "makes work the privileged vehicle of self-realization: it
is by succeeding professionally that one makes a 'success' of one's
life." 50 [Neoliberalism subsumes other]{.underline} [motivations
and]{.underline} [goals, such]{.underline} [as]{.underline} **[obtaining
an]{.underline}** **[education]{.underline}** or cultivating a
friendship, [under the]{.underline} [singular]{.underline} [framework
of]{.underline} **[maximizing one's competitive
advantage]{.underline}**. An individual economic actor, the neoliberal
public subject appears as a "universal" that obfuscates its own
particularity as well as the challenges faced by those who cannot
seamlessly identify with its mode of subjectivity. On the question of
gender, as Brown suggests, neoliberalism both ignores and exacerbates
the difficulties that women face in adopting the position of homo
oeconomicus, since women remain disproportionately responsible for the
familial activities that neoliberalism regards as outside of the market.
In this way, neoliberalism both intensifies and transforms a gendered
division of labor. Intensification appears in the privatization of
public infrastructures that support families and children.
Transformation occurs through erasure of a public language for
identifying and addressing the unequal impact of neoliberal policy
change. As Brown writes, "women both require the visible social
infrastructure that neoliberalism aims to dismantle through
privatization and are the invisible infrastructure sustaining a world of
putatively self-investing human capitals." 51 For Nancy Fraser, this
subjugation appears in the language of emancipation, as neoliberal
policy co-opts the feminist critique of the traditional roles of
breadwinner and homemaker. Supplanting the gendered "family wage" of the
post-World War II era in Western economies, neoliberal policy
romanticizes "female advancement and social justice" but undermines the
very conditions and infrastructure necessary for advancement and
justice.52 On a global scale, observes Rebecca Dingo, neoliberalism sets
"women on a path toward formal market activities without recognizing the
wide-reaching vectors of oppression and exploitation that impoverish
women." 53 In these ways, policymakers have championed markets as a
universal prescription for national and international development
without regard to context and conditions of exploitation. Neoliberalism
also ignores the role of race and racism on the formation and agency of
public subjectivities. A neoliberal public, as Darrel Wanzer-Serrano
observes, operates "by an active suppression of 'race' as a legitimate
topic or term of public discourse and public policy." 54 Instead,
neoliberalism's emphasis on individual responsibility renders race as an
antiquated category and racism as a problem of the past.55 Bradley Jones
and Roopali Mukherjee explain that a neoliberal public presents a
"socially progressive politics by articulating a colorblind,
cosmopolitan, post-race subject, while characterizing as 'backwards' or
'racist' those who invoke racial claims." 56 If there are only
individuals, then charges of racism and sexism, which associate
individuals with broader categories and implicate agency in structure,
deny individual autonomy and serve only to "excuse" personal failings.
Jones and Mukherjee hold that [neoliberalism depoliticizes and
privatizes difference]{.underline}, [such that "culture becomes a matter
of]{.underline} [individual]{.underline} **[choice]{.underline}**."
57 [These moves replace a dialectic of agency and structure
with]{.underline} **[an exclusive focus on agency]{.underline}**, [and
they bracket the relationship
between]{.underline} [**subjectivity**,]{.underline} [**agency**,
and]{.underline} **[power]{.underline}**. The neoliberal subject appears
as a new bourgeois subject. The cases of gender and race illuminate a
uniform neoliberal discounting of particularity and difference, which
extends to class, sexuality, ethnicity, and more. Presuming
universality, the neoliberal subject fails to recognize how
particularity matters, especially for those whose differences complicate
their enactment of this putative universal. This lack of recognition
carries considerable weight, since, as Wendy Hesford explains,
"recognition affords legibility to certain bodies and social
relationships and not to others." 58 Neoliberalism cannot see the
particularity of its public subject nor the varying advantages and
disadvantages that the presumed adoption of homo oeconomicus places on
the diverse subjects of a pluralistic society. This lack of recognition
propagates resource disparities for people whose particularities carry
additional responsibilities and burdens that complicate the economic
rationality ascribed to homo oeconomicus. A neoliberal public operates
by the principle of competition rather than the coordinated action of a
networked public sphere operating with a dynamic public good. For a
neoliberal public, competition frames social relations as a zero-sum
game; one person's success and standing appear at the expense of
another. In contrast to models of the public sphere and practices that
seek wider opportunities for agency**[,]{.underline}** **[a neoliberal
public presents actors with strategic advantages in
limiting]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}** **[agency]{.underline}** **[and
denying the autonomy]{.underline}** **[of
others]{.underline}**. [This]{.underline} [constitutes a brutal embrace
of]{.underline}, in Mouffe's terms,
"[the]{.underline} potential **[antagonism]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} [exists
in human relations]{.underline}." Mouffe recognizes the value of
contestation for publicity, but she argues that [productive conflict
requires]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [move from antagonism
to]{.underline} **[agonism]{.underline}**, [which]{.underline} [constructs
an other]{.underline} [in such a way that it is no longer perceived as
an]{.underline} **[enemy]{.underline}** to be
destroyed, [but]{.underline} [as]{.underline} [an
"**adversary**]{.underline}," that is, **[somebody whose ideas we combat
but whose right to defend those ideas we do not put into
question]{.underline}**.59 While agonism brings together conflict and
reciprocity---[which intimate]{.underline}, as Mouffe suggests,
"[some]{.underline} **[common
ground]{.underline}**"---[antagonism]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [neoliberal]{.underline} [competition
emphasize conflict]{.underline} **[without
reciprocity]{.underline}**, [which appears as a corollary of
turning]{.underline} [social]{.underline} [commitments]{.underline} **[inward]{.underline}**.

In this vein, denying another's voice or disavowing relationships with
others may remove competitive obstacles to one's own success. Shifting
from a laissez-faire view of market and state relations, neoliberalism
enjoins the state to take actions that bolster competition. As Jamie
Peck explains, Friedman and other neoliberal theorists "expressly sought
to transcend the 'naïve ideology' of laissez-faire, in favor of a
'positive' conception of the state as the guarantor of a competitive
order." 60 Through privatization and trade agreements, the state may
create markets. Through the reduction or elimination of social safety
nets, the state may compel market behavior. Through various means, notes
Sanford Schram, neoliberalism "restructures the state to operate
consistently with market logic in order to better promote
market-compliant behavior by as many people as possible." 61 Concordant
with a rise in income inequality in the United States, the contemporary
disinvestment in and privatization of public institutions by state
officials creates particular hardships for low-income and minority
communities, who depend more on these institutions and may lack the
resources, for example, to send children to well-funded private schools.
Faced with few options, members of marginalized groups confront a
choice: either internalize a market model or suffer as a "disposable
population" that a restructured state has made "less of a burden on the
rest of society." 62 Oftentimes, this putative choice generates both
outcomes---discipline and suffering. While articulating relationships
through a public good to enable coordinated action may promote equality,
inequality functions as the condition and end of competition. To win, we
must become unequal to others. Inequality is not a social problem
warranting redress for a neoliberal public, but a necessary part of its
dynamic operation. As Maurizio Lazzarato explains, "for the neoliberals,
the market can operate as regulatory principle only if competition is
made the regulatory principle of society." 63 Yet, as Lazzarato and
others observe, markets are not natural. Markets must be constructed and
maintained.64 The disciplinary force of neoliberalism serves to compel
people to act according to market logics. Towards this end, inequality
serves a valuable, motivating purpose: "Only inequality has the capacity
to sharpen appetites, instincts and minds, driving individuals to
rivalries." 65 **[Neoliberalism draws on inequality for its very
existence]{.underline}**. [Just as]{.underline} **[structural
conditions]{.underline}** [may enable
and]{.underline} [constrain]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [practice of
a dynamic public good]{.underline} [in a networked public sphere,
structural conditions may influence the practice of
a]{.underline} **[neoliberal public]{.underline}**. For instance, in
Capitalism and Freedom, Friedman proposed educational vouchers to break
a government "monopoly" on education and to foster competition, giving
parents the freedom to choose from a range of "educational services
\[that\] could be rendered by private enterprises operated for profit,
or by non-profit institutions." 66 Yet he issued this call in a U.S.
political climate that was moving in the opposite direction: only a few
years after the publication of Capitalism and Freedom, the federal
government passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which
directed federal dollars to school districts.67 Policymakers did not
implement Friedman's proposal for educational vouchers until the late
1980s and early 1990s, and these programs were limited to only a few
locales.68 In the intervening years, actions by a wide range of people
like Friedman, Reagan, and others gradually shifted perceptions of
people's relations to one another and structures to facilitate this
significant change in public education. The changes wrought by vouchers,
in turn, have created structures that reinforce neoliberal perceptions
of publics and obscure the relationships articulated by a dynamic public
good. For example, the state of Wisconsin adopted a statewide voucher
program in 2015.69 A memo prepared by the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal
Bureau indicated that this expansion would cost public schools between
600 and 800 million dollars over a 10-year period.70 Facing this loss of
revenue, and suffering from state budget cuts, many local districts have
turned to ballot referenda simply to cover operating expenses.71
Moreover, analyses of the Wisconsin voucher program have indicated that
roughly 76 percent of students using vouchers for the first time in the
2015--2016 school year attended a private school the previous year.72
This suggests that the benefits of the expanded voucher program
disproportionately went to families who already possessed the financial
means to send their children to private schools. Together, these changes
have reshaped the structure of publicly funded education in Wisconsin
and weakened its connection to a dynamic public good. Exacerbating
inequalities, this changed structure may reinforce competition, since
parents and students may believe that they can rely only on themselves
to obtain a decent education. Resisting a neoliberal public The rise of
a neoliberal public constitutes a portentous development that may, among
other things, exacerbate inequality and marginalize people who do not
fit the ideal of homo oeconomicus. Yet this development does not signal
a totalizing transformation of the public sphere. A networked public
sphere, composed of publics and counterpublics, holds the potential for
resistance and a resurgent critical publicity. Resistance would not
arise from an Archimedean point outside of a networked public sphere,
but within this public sphere, countering the circulation and influence
of a neoliberal public. Drawing on the mobility, flexibility, and
generativity of interactions in a network, a resurgent critical
publicity may emerge through new and reconfigured sites of engagement
and human relationships. On issues regarding race and police brutality,
for example, contemporary activists have sought to reshape public
agendas and hold officials and officers accountable.73 On education,
local communities have pushed back against market reforms and have
demanded alternatives. These examples suggest the power of the
local---or, more specifically, a networked local---as a historically
emergent site of resistance against a neoliberal public. While I do not
have the space to articulate a fully developed theory of local
resistance, in this penultimate section I sketch a model of a networked
local and, using education examples from Wisconsin, indicate how it may
challenge a neoliberal public.74 In The Public and Its Problems, John
Dewey envisioned reinvigorated public engagement through the emergence
of a Great Community, a network of local communities through which
people can reclaim their agency and purposefully direct their
experiences in meaningful ways. A Great Community would enact a
large-scale realization of the fundamental link between democracy and
community: operating with a non-institutional conception of democracy,
Dewey insisted that democracy functions most powerfully through human
relationships, as people work together to address shared concerns and
achieve shared goals.75 He envisioned democracy as placing individuals
and communities in a reciprocal relationship such that individuals may
draw upon social networks to realize their potential.
Relationships---among individuals, between individuals and communities,
and among communities---are key. Isolated individual action can neither
build nor benefit from community: "no amount of aggregated collective
action of itself constitutes a community." Instead, people need to
value, construct, and maintain relationships.76 A Great Community may
appear through coordinated action and, in turn, bolster coordinated
action. Dewey discovered in the local the resources for rebuilding
democratic relationships and engaged publics, yet he also recognized the
limits of the local. The local provides a basis for public engagement
and regular, ongoing interactions that enable learning, through which
people can improve their practices. In this way, the significance of the
local does not lie in physicality as such, but in the accompanying
benefits that attend proximity and familiarity: "there is no substitute
for the vitality and depth of close and direct intercourse and
attachment." 77 In local communities people may come to know their
interlocutors ---if not by name, then through a shared sense of
belonging to their community---and practice public engagement through
familiar experiences. The regularity of local interaction creates
opportunities for trial and error; people may reflect on past
interactions, learn from what they regard as mistakes, and change their
practices in subsequent interactions with one another. Local engagement
can develop people's competence, confidence, and perspective.
Nevertheless, Dewey recognized the limits of the local in its potential
for insularity, which can produce provincialism, bigotry,
marginalization, and exclusion. An isolated local is as limited, and as
detached from critical publicity, as an isolated individual. Just as a
community requires relations among individuals, a Great Community
requires relations among communities: "its larger relationships will
provide an inexhaustible and flowing fund of meanings upon which to
draw." 78 Scholars of rhetoric and communication, in particular, may
recognize how these relationships may elicit productive tensions between
the contextualized discourse of particular sites in a network and the
revisions that may occur when discourse circulates across a network.
With regard to the former, Hauser observes that a rhetorical model of
the public sphere emphasizes "local norms" for judging discourse rather
than universal standards.79 Yet, as Hauser notes, within a multiple
public sphere, norms and judgments will vary across a network. Further,
the publics and counterpublics encountering any discourse will change as
people participate across different nodes in a network.80 [Far from
being]{.underline} [an]{.underline} [obstacle to
engagement]{.underline} [across
a]{.underline} [network]{.underline}, **[the]{.underline}** **[contingent
character]{.underline}** **[of any]{.underline}** **[particular
node]{.underline}** or set of
relationships [may]{.underline} [engender]{.underline} **[dynamic]{.underline}** **[movement]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[contestation]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} [questions]{.underline} **[assumptions]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [explores
relationships]{.underline} [through]{.underline} [diverse
perspectives]{.underline}. [A networked local, which participates in a
varied constellation of local communities, holds the potential to guard
against]{.underline} **[the limits of the local]{.underline}**. Dewey
held that mobility may in the end supply the means by which the spoils
of remote and indirect interaction and interdependence flow back into
local life, keeping it flexible, preventing the stagnancy which has
attended stability in the past, and furnishing it with the elements of a
variegated and many-hued experience.81 Realizing this promise requires
active and purposeful attention to relationships. In a networked public,
relationships themselves exert no productive force independently from
the people and communities who constitute them. Relationships must be
tended to---constructed, cultivated, reflected upon, reevaluated,
rebuilt. Participating in a network, a local community may be more open
and inclusive, incorporating various issues, identities, and modes of
participation. Contributing to a network, a local community may foster
more widespread change. In the past few years, in communities across
Wisconsin, people have pushed back against funding cuts for public
schools, increased spending on private vouchers, expansion of charter
schools, and other legislative measures that have threatened public
education. These local advocates have worked within their own
communities and joined together to try to change the public discourse
about education in Wisconsin. For example, in Wauwatosa, home of
Governor Scott Walker, local community members have formed an
organization called Wauwatosa S.O.S (Support Our Schools) and have waged
a multifaceted campaign consisting of websites, yard signs, t-shirts,
door-to-door advocacy, and a letter-writing campaign to argue not only
against budget cuts for education, but for increased funding.82 These
have not been isolated efforts, as advocates in different communities
have worked together. For instance, leaders of community groups in
Milwaukee, Wauwatosa, and Lake Mills (a small town between Milwaukee and
Madison) co-authored a public letter to decry the governor's and
legislators' "stunning failure to support our kids." The authors---Mary
Young, Marva Herndon, Gail Hicks, and Sandy Whisler---noted than in
recent spring elections, more than 70 local referenda had appeared on
ballots across the state to "prevent cuts and school closings." They
called on policymakers to "pause the statewide expansion of voucher
schools" and to "support the only school system that serves all and
lifts all---public schools---before it's too late." 83 In their efforts,
these community advocates have bridged some of the racial and
ideological divides that historically have plagued Milwaukee and its
surrounding suburbs.84 Their efforts exemplify the contingency and
diversity of a networked public and the local communities that comprise
it---not uniformly, not homogeneously, but by working together over
specific concerns. Addressing issues like funding cuts and vouchers,
these advocates have drawn on a networked public good to call attention
to relationships and rebuild and expand connections threatened by a
neoliberal approach to public education. In situating public schools as
"the only school system that serves all and lifts all," Young, Herndon,
Hicks, and Whisler underscored how serving a diverse student population,
rather than employing particular screening criteria that may exclude
poor and minority students, exemplifies the idea that people have a
stake in the growth of children across differences, connecting people of
diverse backgrounds in a mutual project. They represented schools as a
site for productively engaging difference, holding that "our kids'
public schools are the heart of our communities." 85 In connecting
school and community, they cast education not only as a means of
enhancing one's individual competitiveness, but as a way of
strengthening bonds while also enabling individuals to realize their
potential. Relatedly, in a public letter to the governor and state
legislature signed by 35 public school principals from Southern
Wisconsin, signees decried the "competitive nature and business model
schools now face." They wrote that this competitive model has produced
"segregated schools" and "haves and have nots." The principals suggested
that this model weakened relationships and divided communities.
Recalling the nation's "bold promise to freely educate all children
regardless of wealth, religion, race, gender, ability or citizenship,"
the principals invoked the force of coordinated action, which they
enacted in their jointly signed letter, to achieve educational
excellence.86 Resisting a uniform approach, they envisioned connections
through partnerships among local communities as well as local
communities and the state. Conclusion In this essay, I have argued that
[neoliberalism represents a threat to a multiple public sphere and its
critical attention to difference and (in)equality. Neoliberalism takes

neoliberal public represents a return of a bourgeois public by
obfuscating its particularity and the uneven burdens faced by different
people as they seek to obtain the position of homo oeconomicus. In its
operation, competition may build unequal structures that raise
additional obstacles for a dynamic public good. Using the example of
community advocacy for public education, I have argued that resistance
to a neoliberal public may arise through the coordinated action of
networked locals. [Denying the possibility

a]{.underline} **[constellation]{.underline}** [of relations in a

**We advocate for a semiotic reorientation away from capital and time

engaging with new forms of communication can re-structure our
enunciation from individualism towards a collective with real political
effects. By bypassing signs and the resolution the 1AC becomes an object
that speaks for itself, creating an autonomous imperative that bypasses
the hierarchies of capitalist language. Only via semiotic introspection
as a starting point can we initiate true resistance in an age of
isolation**

Production of Subjectivity\", Chapter 2: Signifying Semiologies and
Asignifying Semiotics in Production and in the Production of
Subjectivity)//gideon

In modern-day capitalism [subjectivity is the product of a worldwide
mass industry]{.underline}. For Guattari, it is even the primary and
most important of capitalist effects since [subjectivity conditions and
participates in the production of all other commodities]{.underline}. 1
[**Subjectivity** is a \"**key commodity**\" whose \"nature\" is
**conceived, developed, and manufactured**]{.underline} in the same way
as an automobile, electricity, or a washing machine. More than an
economic or political crisis[, the · crisis in which we have been
stuck]{.underline} since the 1970s [represents a crisis in the
production of subjectivity]{.underline}, [which can hardly be explained
by technical, economic, or political processes]{.underline}.
Subjectivity, subjectivation, processes of subjectivation, and
subjection are all concepts that consistently appear in critical thought
since the 1960s (Foucault, Ranciere, etc.), covering different and often
contradictory ideas. In this regard Felix Guattari, who went further in
the conceptual problematization and cartography of the features and
modalities of the production of subjectivity, points to several
[pitfalls]{.underline} it is best [to avoid]{.underline}. First of all,
[the structuralist impasse]{.underline}, [which reduces subjectivity to
the]{.underline} mere [result]{.underline} [of]{.underline} ..
[signifying operations]{.underline}: \"What the structuralists say
isn\'t true; [it isn\'t the facts of language or]{.underline} even
[communication that generate subjectivity]{.underline}. At a certain
level, [it is collectively manufactured]{.underline} in the same way as
energy, electricity, or aluminum.\"2 [The production of subjectivity
puts into play something]{.underline} [very different from linguistic
performance]{.underline}: **[ethological]{.underline}**,
**[fantasmic]{.underline}** dimensions, **[economic]{.underline}**,
**[aesthetic]{.underline}**, and **[physical]{.underline}** [semiotic
systems]{.underline}, **[existential territories]{.underline}**, and
**[incorporeal universes]{.underline}**, [all of which are irreducible
to a semiology of language]{.underline}. The concept [of the substance
of expression **must be pluralized**]{.underline} in order [to bring to
the fore the]{.underline} **[extralinguistic, non-human, biological,
technological, aesthetic, and machinic substances of
expression]{.underline}**. The [second pitfall]{.underline} comes
[from]{.underline} [phenomenology and psychoanalysis, whose concepts
reduce]{.underline} \"[the facts of subjectivity to drives]{.underline},
[affects]{.underline}, [intra-subjective apparatuses and
relations]{.underline},\" which Guattari also defines as
\"intersubjective drivel.\"3 [Technical]{.underline} (digital,
communicational, media) [and]{.underline} [social machines modulate and
format subjectivity]{.underline} by acting [not only within memory and
sense but also within the unconscious]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
non-human, [machinic part of subjectivity is irreducible to intra- and
intersubjective relations]{.underline} . . To avoid the third,
sociological pitfall, [we must move away froni methodological
individualism and holism]{.underline}. Processes of subjectivation or
semiotization are not centered on individual agents or on collective
(intersubjective) agents. The production of [subjectivity
is]{.underline} indeed [a \"collective\" process]{.underline}, [yet the
collective]{.underline} both [goes beyond the individual]{.underline},
in an extra-personal dimension ([machinic, economic, social,
technological systems]{.underline}), [and precedes the
person]{.underline} (preverbal intensities within a system of affects
and intensities). [Finally]{.underline}, there is the last difficulty,
which Guattari calls [the]{.underline} \"[complex of
infrastructures]{.underline}\": a [material infrastructure that
generates an ideological superstructure]{.underline} (Marxism), [an
instinctual infrastructure that generates the psyche]{.underline}
(Freud), o[r deep syntactic and linguistic structures that
produce]{.underline} linguistic ([signified) content]{.underline}.
[We]{.underline} will [look to avert these]{.underline} three [stumbling
blocks while]{.underline} at the same time [avoiding the pitfalls of
structuralism.]{.underline}

1\. The Remnants of Structuralism: Language Without Structure

**[Structuralism is dead]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline} what founded
[its paradigm-languageis still]{.underline} very much
[alive]{.underline}. Surprisingly, it is doing quite well, even after
the critical theories that came out of the major theoretical innovations
of the 1960s and 70s cleared a way out of structuralism. Here, however,
[language does not have the systemic and combinatory neutrality of
structuralism.]{.underline} [Critical thought has]{.underline}
[radically politicized language]{.underline} [yet]{.underline}
[without]{.underline} ever fully [giving up on the logic according to
which language is unique to man and thus the cornerstone of
politics]{.underline}. For Paolo Virno, [politics must not be sought in
the uses the speaker makes of it]{.underline}; [language is
intrinsically political]{.underline} insofar as its activity or [praxis
is realized in the public sphere.]{.underline} **[Politics and the
possession of language are literally one and the same]{.underline}**.
For Ranciere, the logos constitutes the measure and verification of
politics\' sole principle\--equality. Even a command, for one to be
given, presupposes a minimum of equality, the equality of logos. [In
order for subordinates to understand and execute an order, they must
share the same language as the person who issues it]{.underline}.
[Equality is]{.underline} in this way [verified in
language.]{.underline} Judith Butler considers all her work an extension
of Hannah Arendt\'s affirmation that \"men become political beings as
beings of language.\" In the same vein, Giorgio Agamben establishes a
strict relationship between language and human nature, because man,
\"uniquely among living things, \[ \... \] has put \[ . . . \] his very
nature at stake in language.\"4 The more or less critical, more or less
problematic, references are first of all Aristotle and his twofold
definition of man (\"Man is the only animal to possess language\" and
\"man is a political animal\"), Hannah Arendt, and analytic philosophy.
For Vimo and Butler, the latter provides the starting point for [a
repoliticization of language through an analysis of the relationship
between \"words and power.\"]{.underline} According to Pascal Michon,
who instead draws on the German tradition, [we have undergone a
\"forgetting of the specificity of language.\" **The critique of
capitalism and** a truly **subversive politics of art must be founded
on** \"humanity\'s sole creative force, the sole utopian force: the
force of **language**.]{.underline}\"5 Today, [Lacan\'s
psychoanalysis]{.underline}, [an apogee of structuralist
thought]{.underline}, [seems to be attracting new
disciples]{.underline}. With Freudian themes interpreted in terms of
Saussurean linguistics (the Hegelian master-slave dialectic), [the
subject becomes an effect of language and language the source of the
subject]{.underline}; [the unconscious]{.underline} is [structured like
a language and]{.underline}, like a language, it [functions through
metaphor and metonymy]{.underline}. 6 The \"chain of signifiers,\" their
combinatory, their \"autonomy,\" their exteriority, their existence
prior to all experience, produces both the signified and the subject.
The Hegelian-Lacanian formation of the subject is faithfully faken up by
ZiZek and, albeit with certain revisions, by Butler. Although she
refuses the \"structuring role of the law of the father,\" .Butler has
the signifier act as a performative within Lacanian theoryleading to the
same results. Language functions as a molar constraint, as a
transcendental, as an \"original and radical servitude\" that \"precedes
and exceeds\" the subject . . In an attempt to move beyond the reductive
hypotheses inherited from Marxism, which made language a superstructure
or ideological artifact, Ranciere transforms language along with affects
. into the very origin of society: \"[the \'social\']{.underline} \[
\... \] [is]{.underline} in fact [constituted by a series of discursive
acts and reconfigurations of a perceptive field]{.underline}.\"7
Language and aff ects not only define the object of the distribution of
the sensible, according to Ranciere (with the bourgeoisie controlling
speech and \"educated meaning\" while the proletariat emits only animal
noise, expressing itself through \"brute sense\"), they also constitute
new productive forces. For my friends in cogni- . rive capitalism, [the
nature of labor and capital is given through \_-language and affects as
well]{.underline}. Cognitive labor mobilizes the latter and [cognitive
capitalism captures and exploits them]{.underline}. way of understanding
language, even if defined according to ·its ·political or productive
function, seems to me a sharp discrepancy \\vith the nature and
functioning of subjectivity, enunciation, and production in modern-day
capitalism. In all these theories, and despite their critical aims, [we
remain in a \"logocentric\" world]{.underline}, [whereas with capitalism
we have]{.underline} for some time [entered a \"machinecentric\" world
that configures]{.underline} the functions of [language in a different
way]{.underline}. In the machine-centric universe, [one moves from the
question of the subject to that of subjectivity]{.underline} such that
[enunciation]{.underline} does not primarily [refer to]{.underline}
speakers and listeners-the communicational version of individualism-but
to \"[complex assemblages of individuals, bodies, material and social
machines, semiotic, mathematical, and scientific machines]{.underline},
etc., which are the true sources of enunciation.\"8 [The sign machines
of]{.underline} **[money]{.underline}**, \_**[economics]{.underline}**,
**[science]{.underline}**, **[technology]{.underline}**,
**[art]{.underline}**, and so on, [function in parallel or
independently]{.underline} because [they produce or convey
meaning]{.underline} [and]{.underline} in this way **[bypass language,
significations, and representation]{.underline}**. In the mid-1960s,
Pier Paolo Pasolini described the hold capital\'s modes of semiotization
have over language as the beginning of a \"post-human world\" in which
the sites of linguistic creation shifr to \"production\'\' and
machinisms. Given Italy\'s linguistic \"backwardness,\" this process
appeared in a particularly striking way. In the linguistic sphere, [the
second industrial revolution brought about \"the substitution of
languages of infrastructures]{.underline} \[ . . . \] [for the languages
of superstructures]{.underline}.\" It had always been the case, from
Egyptian civilization to the first industrial revolution, that \"the
linguistic models that dominate a society and make it linguistically
unitary are the models of the cultural superstructures\'\' and of the
intellectual elites in law, literature, education, and religion. Then
suddenly, with the turn from capitalism to neo-capitalism, which
coincided with the transformation of the \"scientific spirit\" into the
integral \"application of science\" to production, \"the languages of
the infrastructures, let us say simply the languages of production, are
guiding society linguistically. It had never happened before.\"9 The
languages of \"production-consumption\'\' produce \"a kind of
downgrading of the word, tied to the deterioration of the humanistic
languages of the elites, which have been, until now, the guiding
languages.\"10 The centers that create, develop, and unify language
\"are no longer the universities, but the Jactories.\"11 The
\"interregional and international\" language of the future will be a
\"signing\" language of \"a world unified by industry and technocracy,\"
that is, \"a communication of men no longer men.\"12 This is exactly the
opposite of what one finds asserted by the exponents of the linguistic
turn: analysis is supposed only to examine the \"language of
infrastructures\" and the subordination of \"humanist\" languages,
language, and signifying semiotics to the semiotics of production and
consumption. Even Hannah Arendt in The Modern Condition warns us that
although the \"ability to act,\" to \"start new unprecedented
processes,\" is still present, 13 it has become the privilege of the
sciences which \"have been forced to adopt a \'language\' of
mathematical symbols \[ . .. \] that in no way can be translated back
into speech.\" If we \"adjust our cultural attitudes to the present
status of scientific achievement, we would in all earnest adopt a way of
life in which speech is no longer meaningful,\" for scientists \"move in
a world where speech has lost its power.\"14 Arendt subtly remarks
something her commentators have failed to notice, namely that the dose
relationship between action and speech, which occurs \"without the
intermediary of things or matter,\'\'15 belongs to a \"human
condition\'\' which has not been our condition since at least the first
industrial revolution. Pasolini\'s analyses, which show that it is not
only in the sciences that \"language has lost its power,\" are carried
still further in the work of Guattari. The latter specifies the nature
and function of the \"languages of infrastructures\" in his most
important contribution to the question: asignifying semiotics. To map
the \"languages of infrastructures\" and the modes of machine-centric
subjectivation/enunciation, one must follow Guattari\'s advice to
\"ex.it language\" by doing two things: dissociate subjectivity from the
subject, from the individual, and even from the human, and cease
considering the power of enunciation exclusive to man and subjectivity.
Guattari sees no reason to deny the equivalent of a subjectivitythe
equivalent of a \"non-human for-itself \[pour soi\]\" (which he calls
proto-subjectivity) and of a power of enunciation (which he calls
proto-enunciation)-with living and material assemblages. He asks rather
that we consider the possibility of forces other than those of the
individuated subject\'s consciousness, sense, and language that might
function as vectors of subjectivation or as focal points of enunciation.
Guattari extends the autopoietic power, the potential of selfproduction,
to all machines. It is a power capable of developing its own rules and
modes of expression, a power which Francisco Varela reserves solely for
living machines. \"\[A\]ll machinic systems, whatever domain they belong
to-technical, biological, semiotic, logical, abstract-are, by
themselves, the support for proto-subjective processes, which I will
characterize in terms of modular subjectivity\'\' or \"partial
subjectivity.\"16 Modes of subjectivation, assemblages of semiotization
and enunciation of all kinds-human and non-human, collective or
individual-coexist within biological, economic, aesthetic, scientific,
and social processes. Guattari\'s theory captures the fate of the
creative function in capitalism. Languages as such have no privilege in
creation. On the contrary, their functioning \"can even slow down or
prohibit any semiotic proliferation, and it often remains for
nonlinguistic components to catalyze mutations and break \[ \... \] the
dominant lingriistic significations\" and to serve as heterogeneous
vectors of subjectivation. \"Genetic codes throughout the history of
life and iconic systems, like art, throughout the history of humanity,
have been at least as rich \[ . . . \] as linguistic systems.\"17 If one
considers all human and non-human reality as \"expressive,\" that is, as
source, emergence, and detonator of processes of subjectivation and
enunciation, then reality is present in our actions as multiple
possibilities, as \"optional matter.\" Thought and choices are exercised
on the \"economy of possibles\"; they do not start with man and do not
rely exclusively on \"a signifying discourse produced between speakers
and listeners.\" The history of evolution teaches us that if the
\"freedom\" of possible choices exists at \"higher\" anthropological
stages, they must he presupposed and found equally at the most
\"elementary\" levels of the living being and matter. Subjectivity,
creation, and enunciation are the results of an assemblage of human,
infra-human, and extra-human factors in which signifying, cognitive
semiotics constitute but one of the constituent parts. Guattari is not
alone in approaching subjectivity and enunciation from \"the point of
view of things themselves\" rather than that of the subject, human
consciousness, and representation. We can find the same theme, though in
very different terms, in Benjamin, Pasolini, or Klemperer. But well
before their theoretical formulation, the new machines of industrial
production, cinema, and art revealed a metamorphosis of the subject,
object, and their modes of expression. [The cinema\'s invention
disclosed]{.underline} a [reality expressed without representation or
linguistic mediation]{.underline}. It was no longer necessary to trace
signs and symbols in order to show an object, beings, or relations.
[Reality signified all by itself In art]{.underline}, a radical rupture
occurred at the beginning of the century when ready-made, following
cinema\'s example, [signified by way of the object itself]{.underline},
[unassisted by the sign or language]{.underline}. Properly speaking,
[ready-mades are no longer representations but
\"presentations.\"]{.underline} Duchamp\'s Bottle Rack or Fountain are
objects mass-produced by industrial machinisms, produced by a new
power-rather than that of homo Jaber, the power of a machinic
assemblage, which assembles sign, material, and labor flows. Addressing
this form of capitalist production, Marx evoked a global, non-qualified
subjectivity manifesting itself in any object whatsoever. Guattari
explodes \"Marxist\" anthropomorphism and its modes of expression by
pushing the deterritorialization of subjectivity to the extreme. [That
objects might start \"speaking,\" start \"expressing
themselves\"]{.underline} (or start dancing, as they do in the
celebrated passage &om the first book of Capital), [is not capitalist
fetishism,]{.underline} the proof of man\'s alienation, [but rather
marks a **new regime of expression** which **requires a new
semiotics**]{.underline}. [This is not simply a reversal of the
subject\'s activity manifesting itself as the animation of the
object]{.underline}, a reversal one need only stand back on its head.
[This is an irreversible process that shifts the question of the subject
to that of subjectivity]{.underline} [and]{.underline} &om [human
subjectivity to machinic, biological, social, aesthetic]{.underline},
etc., [proto-subjectivities]{.underline}. The return to \"humanism,\"
whatever it may mean, is in any case neither possible nor desirable.
Guattari deploys the philosophical program of Capitalism and
Schizophrenia in the realm of semiotics and the production of
subjectivity. The point is to [leave behind the subject/object dualism
imposed on multiplicities]{.underline}, which are neither subjects nor
objects, by inscribing nature and culture along an indeterminate
continuum. From this point of view, the linguist Louis Hjelmslev\'s work
of the late 1960s and early 1970s on categories of expression and
content proved fundamental. In Hjelmslev, however, the pair expression/
content remains prisoner to the Saussurean opposition between signifier
and signified, whereas for [Guattari expression does not refer to the
signifier or language but to a collective semiotic machine preexisting
both]{.underline} ([a collective assemblage of enunciation encompassing
diverse]{.underline} and heterogeneous substances of human and non-human
[expression]{.underline}). Likewise, [content]{.underline} does not
[refer to]{.underline} the signified but to [a social machine that
preexists]{.underline} it (a machinic assemblage of action and passion
we can by no means reduce to the economic, social, or political
spheres). The double articulation of expression and content is not a
specific property of language; the latter represents only one functional
modality of the organic, biological, social, aesthetic, etc., strata of
reality. The enlarged conception of this twofold relationship allows us
to avoid the pitfalls of Marxism and structuralism, because [expression
and content]{.underline}, one presupposing and reversing the other
reciprocally, [maintain no causal relationship]{.underline}. [Expression
does not depend on content]{.underline} (Marxism), [nor is content the
product of expression]{.underline} (linguistic structuralism).
[Subjectivity is neither the result of linguistic or communicational
expression nor the product of deeper socioeconomic
contents.]{.underline} In a fundamental methodological shift, Guattari
asks us to [grasp the subject/object relation and the expression/content
relation \"by the middle,\" to]{.underline} foreground and
[problematize]{.underline} the \"expressive instance,\" that is, the
[enunciation]{.underline}. In this way, he lays the basis for a new
pragmatics, a new theory of enunciation, in which, paradoxically, the
ground of enunciation is existential, not discursive. 18

2\. Signifying Semiologies

[The **strength of capitalism lies in its articulation** of processes of
social subjection and machinic enslavement as well as in the effects of
their respective **signifying and asignifying semiotics**]{.underline}.
Both apparatuses play a fundamental role in controlling processes of
capitalist deterritorialization and reterritorialization, for [they
enable the adjustment, modification, solicitation, assemblage, and
stabilization of processes of desubjectivation and
subjectivation]{.underline}. The fundamental distinction between
signifying semiologies and asignifying semiotics has to do with the
different ways in which they function and their very different effects
on subjectivity. We will examine them separately in order to elucidate
the distinction, one which no less always involves mixed semiotics.
Instead of making language the site for the verification of equality;
instead of considering it implicitly political because a manifestation
of the publicity of action or, even, of making it a new productive
force, Guattari proposes to \"**[exit language]{.underline}**\"
[and]{.underline} [develop a semiotic theory beyond human
semiotics]{.underline}. In a capitalism organized around and founded on
asignifying semiotics (Pasolini\'s \"languages of infrastructures\"),
language is only \"one particular but in no way privileged example of
the functioning of a general semiotics.\" [This general semiotics must
account]{.underline} for **[both signifying speech and]{.underline}**
the machines of **[aesthetic, technical-scientific, biological, and
social signs]{.underline}**. Guattari distinguishes among different
types of semiotics situated beyond the measures and hierarchizations of
human language: \"natural\" a-semiotic encodings (crystalline systems
and DNA, for example), signifjing semiologies including symbolic (or
pre-signifying, gestural, ritual, productive, corporeal, musical, etc.)
semiologies and semiologies of signification, and, finally, asignifjing
(or post-signifying) semiotics. This represents Guattari\'s most
important contribution to our understanding of capitalism and the
production of subjectivity. In \"natural\" a-semiotic encodings,
[expression is not an autonomous stratum]{.underline} with regard to
content. In a rock, in a crystalline structure, the \"form\" is conveyed
by the \"material\" itself, such that expression and content are
inherent to each other. [There is no differentiating between a mineral,
chemical, or nuclear stratum and a semiotic stratum organized into an
autonomous syntax]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} separation, the
[autonomization, of expression]{.underline} [begins]{.underline} to
develop [with the emergence of life]{.underline}. With plants and
animals \"form\' is transmitted through codes that create [complex
molecules and reproductive systems]{.underline} of species which begin
to [autonomize and to separate from \"substance]{.underline}.\" With
human behavior, [signifying semiologies, and asignifying
semiotics]{.underline}, transmission no longer [depends on]{.underline}
genetic codes but on [learning, memories, languages, symbols, diagrams,
graphs, equations]{.underline}, and so on, in other words, on [semiotics
functioning according to an autonomous syntax and strata of
expression]{.underline}. In semiologies of signification, unlike natural
encodings, expression and content maintain a relationship of
interpretation, reference, and signification.

I. The Political Functions of Semiologies of Signification

[Despite the]{.underline} specific [attention]{.underline} paid [to
symbolic and asignifying semiotics]{.underline} which lie outside of
language, [Guattari has left us with a very precise picture of how
language functions within capitalism]{.underline}. The establishment of
a [language and]{.underline} of a system of dominant [significations
is]{.underline} always first of **[all a political
operation]{.underline}** [before it is a linguistic or
semantic]{.underline} [one]{.underline}. [A certain]{.underline} type of
[language and]{.underline} certain modes of individuated [semiotization
and subjectivation are necessary]{.underline} in order [to stabilize the
social field disrupted by capitalist deterritorialization]{.underline},
[a deterritorialization which undermines]{.underline} previous
subjectivities, forms of life, and [institutions]{.underline}.
[Stabilization entails]{.underline} the predominance of a [national
language,]{.underline} carrying with it the [laws and modes of
functioning]{.underline} of incipient capitalism over dialects,
exceptional languages, and modes of infantile, \"[pathological,\" and
artistic expression]{.underline}. [The national language reduces
them]{.underline} to [marginality by bringing them \"before the court of
dominant syntaxes, semantics, and pragmatics]{.underline}.\" The
constitution of linguistic exchange and of distinct and individuated
speakers is, on the one hand, coextensive with the constitution of
economic exchange, of its rational agents, and of the juridical contract
and its contracting parties. On the other hand, it is coextensive \...
with psychic instances of the \"self\" (id/superego) and the \"other.\"
[Capitalist formations]{.underline} have recourse to a particular type
of signifying semiotic machine which, [overcoding]{.underline} all the
other [semiotics]{.underline}, [allows \"economic\" production as well
as the production of subjectivity to be administered]{.underline},
guided, adjusted, [and controlled]{.underline}. By exercising power over
symbolic semiotics, the semiotics of signification function as both a
general equivalent of expression and a vector of subjectivation centered
on the individual. Throughout Guattari\'s work we encounter the
comparison with symbolic (pre-signifying) semiotics such as they
function in primitive societies. This allows us to grasp the sudden
change as well as the novelty the \"imperialism and despotism\"
oflanguage represents. First of all, **[capitalism requires that
symbolic semiotics]{.underline}** (whether gestural, ritual, productive,
corporeal, musical, etc.) **[be hierarchized and subordinated to
language]{.underline}**. Unlike language, [they \"do not involve a
distinguishable speaker and hearer.]{.underline} Words do not play a
major part, since [the message is carried not via linguistic chains, but
via bodies, sounds, mimicry, posture and so on.\"]{.underline}19 Since
symbolic semiotics are \"transitional, polyvocal, animistic, and
transindividual,\" [they are not easily assigned to
individuated]{.underline} b . (\"I \"\" \" ) su Jeers, to
[persons]{.underline} , you . In our capitalist societies there is still
this transindividual mode of functioning but it is confined to marginal
forms of expression: madness, infancy, artistic creation, and creation
period, as well as amorous or political passion. Symbolic semiologies
and the semiology of signification cannot be distinguished by the strata
of expression they put in play. Symbolic semiologies function according
to a multiplicity (\"n\") of strata or substances of expression
(gestural, ritual, productive, corporeal, musical, etc.), whereas
semiologies of signification bring together only two strata
(signifier/signified). In primitive societies, diff erent semiotic
strata (artistic, religious, linguistic, economic, corporeal, musical,
and so on) do not enter into dependent or hierarchized relation with
each other. [Speech interacts directly with other forms of
expression]{.underline} (ritual, gestural, musical, productive, etc.)
[instead of constituting a higher modality of it]{.underline}. [Each
stratum]{.underline} of expression [conserves its specific consistency
and autonomy]{.underline}. The translatability of diff erent semiotic
strata is not accomplished through a formalization of expression {the
signifier) that overpowers other. [semiotics]{.underline}, but [through
a social assemblage]{.underline} (tribe, community) [which]{.underline},
on the contrary, [precludes the emergence of a single signifying
substance]{.underline}, of a signifying synthesis, of a system that
hierarchizes and subordinates other forms of expression to language[. In
capitalism]{.underline}, on the other hand, these [nonverbal forms of
expression depend on language]{.underline}. \"The signs of society can
be interpreted integrally by those of language, but the reverse is not
so. **[Language is]{.underline}** therefore **[interpreting
society]{.underline}**.\"20 In this way, Emile Benveniste concludes [the
superiority of language over other semiotic systems]{.underline}. It
leads Guattari to remark: \"[One sought to make symbolic semiotics
dependent on linguistic semiologies on the pretense that they could not
be deciphered, understood, or translated without]{.underline} recourse
to [language]{.underline}. But what does that prove? We wouldn\'t say
that because we take a plane to go from the US to Europe that the two
continents depend on aviation.\"21 Generalized exchange is not part of
the economic sphere alone. The comparison, quantification, and exchange
of economic values necessitate, first of all, significations that remain
invariant in time and space, enabling a general translatability of
[semiotics into a linguistic \"standard]{.underline}.\" Determining
\"[value\" requires the institution of a national language that operates
the comparison and internal translatability of languages]{.underline}
and local dialects. [In reality]{.underline}, **[words and sentences
have no sense except within a particular enunciation]{.underline}**, a
specific syntax, and a local micro-political situation. Every day every
one of us passes through a multiplicity of heterogeneous languages: a
language we speak to our families, at work, with friends, with God, with
our superiors, and so on. Language has to function as an equivalent to
these different

Cybernetics of Karl W. Deutsch," in European Journal of International
Relations, vol. 17, no. 2, pp. 354--378")

I conclude with my forward-looking reconstruction of Deutsch's likely
answer to Der Derian's question. First of all, we can be reasonably
confident what Deutsch thought about certain specific '[closed world'
human-machine systems]{.underline}. Deutsch emphatically agreed with
Wiener (and Der Derian) about [the dangers of automated defense systems
giving false alarms and making other decisions about war and
peace]{.underline}.Footnote43 Deutsch's particular complaint, however,
was not one of ontological discontinuity, but that [these
systems]{.underline} [were not based on adequate substantive
knowledge]{.underline}. He would, of course, also want people, who were
morally and politically accountable, making such important decisions in
as decentralized a way as possible.Footnote44 But, as the interpretive
analysis above makes clear, he would have been in favor of enhancing
decision-maker powers using 'open systems' capable of adaptation,
learning, and self-restructuring, when functionally appropriate or
necessary. Secondly---and here his sympathy with Wiener's efforts to
build cybernetic 'prosthetic' devices might come into play---Deutsch
would be rather open to the use of cybernetic devices as augmentations
to human intelligence, especially when in the service of progressive
forms of national development and the urgent need for international
integration, peace, and security. Again, the quotation from the 1966
Introduction to The Nerves of Government above makes this clear, as does
his positive use of Rapoport and Chammah's simulational workFootnote45
in diagnosing possible pathways to overcoming the deleterious effects of
inequality within and among nations, and his sustained investigation of
improved service delivery systems with Manfred Kochen. Deutsch cited
studies of different ways of simulating international conflict, and was
aware of Harold Guetzkow's many studies of simulated international
processes.Footnote46 At the Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin, he supported
Stuart Bremer and associates' development and utilization for contingent
forecasting purposes of the GLOBUS simulation (Bremer, 1987).Footnote47
But as is clear to anyone familiar with these kinds of studies and
Deutsch's empirical style, Deutsch would be strongly in favor of
empirically grounded simulation modeling. His own tentative efforts to
suggest a model of social mobilization processes, mentioned above,
indicates this preference, even if the Kochen and Deutsch
design-oriented study only uses rather stylized, synoptic empirical
referents as ideal types. Bremer's team developing and applying GLOBUS
was heavily empirically oriented. Bremer's earlier work was an important
contribution to Guetzkow's Simulated International Processes project and
its successor efforts summarized in Guetzkow and Valadez (1981). That
volume is exemplary in the use of systematic empirical evidence in
constructing later-generation international simulation models and
formalized decision-making modules for possible use within human-machine
mixed (low-tech cyborg) simulational systems. It is also exemplary in
Guetzkow's summary assessment of his modeling efforts using more than 50
empirical-historical validational studies. Deutsch would therefore
probably ask of today's and tomorrow's cyborg hybrids: are their models'
assumptions empirically tested and updated by systematic programs of
critical and public socio-political science?Footnote48 I would like
additionally to suggest that these lines of empirically-historically
disciplined simulational work represent a real, if imperfect and
temporary, institutionalization of an anti-militarist line of social
scientific cyborg research of the sort identified by hypothesis IH3
above. Beyond the brief mention of Rapoport and Boulding's efforts noted
above, neither Hayles, Edwards, nor Mirowski cites these specific
developments.Footnote49 Unfortunately, to my knowledge, continuations of
this kind of security-oriented work are very imperfect in today's
international affairs funding environment. What about [[the 'closed
world discourse formations']{.underline}]{.mark} which are so central to
the Der Derian-Edwards-Mirowski concerns? Here, in light of the above
review of Deutsch's relevant work, is a fourth Deutschean answer to Der
Derian's question. (IH9): When [closed world discourses/practices
[at]{.mark} or near [the heart of American]{.mark}]{.underline} (or any
other entity's[) [security-seeking]{.mark} command, control, and
communication [practices evidence strong tendencies]{.mark} in networks
of socio-political communication [toward lethal forms of
self-closure]{.mark}, they are likely [symptoms of]{.mark} much more
general [pathological, destructive forms of]{.mark} extreme
[ideologies]{.mark}, nationalist, transnationalist, or
internationalist.]{.underline}Footnote50 If they are at odds with the
organizing principles of a larger society, then **[[the battle to
correct them can be crucial in determining the fate of that
society]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In passing, I have already mentioned
that Deutsch's [[cybernetic discourse]{.mark} was intended to apply to
nationalist as well as non-nationalist ideologies]{.underline}. Could
one not **[use it [to criticize]{.mark} extreme nationalism when it
appears in '[the War on Terror']{.mark}, just as one could use it to
criticize the destructive self-closure of [Stalin's 'socialist
internationalism', or Al Qaeda's militant Islamic
transnationalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**? If we [add [dimensions of
personal alienation]{.mark} and humiliation, as well as [organizational
renewal]{.mark}]{.underline} (Stern, 2003: Chapters 1 and 2),
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} Deutsch's [[inequality dynamic for generating
militant behavior]{.mark}, especially among those mobilized but not
assimilated elites and masses, [and allow it to work]{.mark} within as
well as [across different levels of global
societ]{.mark}]{.underline}[y]{.mark}, can we not see here some of the
nationalist-transnationalist dynamics of contemporary terrorist groups
and their supporters? Finally, [conside]{.underline}r the moral and
religious dimensions of Deutsch's [[cybernetic
theorizing]{.underline}]{.mark} once again, **[[within]{.mark} the
broader context of [an alternative]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[open, and
life-sustaining discourse formation]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Despite the
[informational]{.underline} limitations of Wiener's communicational 'bit
flows', Deutsch is clearly concerned [with emotional]{.underline} as
well as informational [intelligence]{.underline}; he is not
cybernetically trapped by a Cartesian separation of mind and body
(Damasio, 1995). He wants an understanding of life processes that allows
growth, novelty, and innovation. One could even [identify]{.underline}
his [concerns]{.underline} as [involving an embodied notion of the
spiritual dimension of human life.]{.underline} Recall our initial
reference to a 'God's-eye view' of the battlefield. Deutsch would more
likely have recalled the biblical belief that the kingdom of God is
within you (Luke 17: 21). Deutsch's unusual quotation **[on openness to
the encompassing suggests looking within ourselves as well as
outwards]{.underline}**. **[[The mystery and awe of the
encompassing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Wiener's 'dark mystery of the
future', combined with the awesome mysterium tremendum of theological
speculation,Footnote51 **[[could serve us all better than 'shock and
awe']{.mark} as a beacon for the future]{.underline}**. Coming from a
non-sectarian, non-dogmatic, inclusive faith, Deutsch has proposed a
universalistic, yet scientific, ethic in terms of which pride, idolatry,
humility, and evil conduct by nations and other agencies can be
operationally, if tentatively, judged. Is it not time to ask those
questions of our own nation, as well as of our enemies? In the long run,
partly for religious reasons, Deutsch was a qualified optimist,
**[[seek]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing out **[the powers for good of
[pluralistic forms of government and governance]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
In the near future, **[[humankind could at best move toward the
formation of pluralistic]{.underline}]{.mark}** security
**[[communities]{.mark} at the regional and global
levels]{.underline}**. But certain problems, including the financing of
global public goods, the threat of nuclear weapons, and the
environmental viability of our species, do and will require some
amalgamated forms of global governance. [**[Addressing gross
inequalities]{.mark}** **[and developing habits of
non-intervention]{.mark}** unless associated with collective legitimacy
**[are parts of such developments]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [[To
succeed]{.mark}, not only good will and sustained effort, but [political
creativity and inventiveness will be needed]{.mark}, together **[with a
political culture of greater international openness]{.mark}**,
**[understanding and compassion. Without such a new political climate
and new political efforts, mankind(SIC) is unlikely to survive for
long]{.mark}**]{.underline}.Footnote52
