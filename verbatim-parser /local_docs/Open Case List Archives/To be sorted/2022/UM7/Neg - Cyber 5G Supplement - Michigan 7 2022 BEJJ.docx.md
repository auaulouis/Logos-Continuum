[China is willing to **work with Poland** to move the traditional
**friendship** forward, enhance **mutual trust** and **deepen
exchanges** and **cooperation** to continue to promote the healthy and
stable development of bilateral ties, State Councilor and Foreign
Minister Wang Yi said on Friday.]{.underline}

Wang made the remarks when he held the third plenary session of
China-Poland Intergovernmental Cooperation Committee with Polish Foreign
Minister Zbigniew Rau.

Wang said [China attaches importance to its relations with
Poland]{.underline} and stands ready to implement important consensuses
reached by the two heads of state.

Wang called on the two countries to promote cooperation in various
fields, including economy and trade, science and technology and
environmental protection; resume personnel exchanges in an orderly
manner and expand mutual investment to continuously enlarge common
interests.

China hopes [Poland could provide a fair, open and non-discriminatory
investment and business environment for **Chinese
companies**]{.underline}, Wang said.

China supports enterprises of the two countries to discuss the
establishment of a two-way warehousing, logistics and distribution
system for the European and Chinese markets with Poland as the
distribution center, Wang added.

Rau said that Poland firmly adheres to the one-China principle and
welcomes Chinese enterprises to invest in Poland.

[**Poland** supports the strengthening of **European Union-China
cooperation** and cooperation between China and Central and Eastern
European Countries and is willing to become the **door** of **EU-China
cooperation**]{.underline}, he added.

[They also exchanged views on the **Ukraine issue**. Wang said that
China\'s position is to promote **peace talks**]{.underline}. Attempts
by the United States using the issue to smear and attack China should be
guarded against and rejected, he added.

Rau said [Poland is **willing to cooperate** with all parties to
overcome the **energy** and **food crisis** caused by the conflict while
**reiterating that Ukraine\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity
should be safeguarded**.]{.underline}

#### Recent cooperation has revitalized efforts.

[On July 19th, the]{.underline} 9th [China-EU High-Level Economic and
Trade Dialogue (HED),]{.underline} co-chaired by China\'s vice-premier
Liu He and executive vice-president of the European Commission, Valdis
Dombrovskis, and participated by more than 20 ministerial-level
officials, [was **successfully held**]{.underline}.

[Through pragmatic, frank and **efficient discussions**, the two sides
reached a series of **consensus** and **deliverables** on
**macro-economic policy coordination**, cooperation on **industrial**
and **supply chains**, WTO reform, further market opening-up,
implementation of the China-EU Agreement on Geographical Indications,
animal and plant inspection and quarantine, two-way opening-up of the
financial sector and regulatory cooperation, among others.]{.underline}

[The dialogue **injected stability** into **China-EU
coop**eration]{.underline}.

To further implement the important consensus reached by president Xi
Jinping, president Charles Michel and president von der Leyen at various
occasions, especially at the 23rd China-EU Summit, the two sides
stressed the importance of jointly combating global challenges and
deepening supply chain cooperation.

In a world of profound changes, we believe that [**healthy** and
**stable China-EU relations**, **especially** in the **economic** and
**trade realm**, can help **counter** the **uncertainty** on the
**global economic stage**, and are **conducive** to **global development
and prosperity**]{.underline}.

This is especially true as global economy suffers from multiple crises.

The two sides should make good use of mechanisms such as macro-economic
policy dialogue and financial dialogue, strengthen communication and
coordination on macro-economic policies, deepen cooperation on global
food and energy security, and jointly promote the stability of the world
economic and financial market.

In an effort to boost the post-pandemic recovery, [China and the EU need
to maintain the stability of global industrial and supply chains,
strengthen the coordination and cooperation on Covid-19 pandemic
control, and ensure the secure and smooth running of sea, air and land
trade routes including China Railway Express]{.underline}.

### 1NC -- Commercial Adv -- AT: Smart Cities

#### Smart cities [fail]{.underline} -- public concerns prevent implementation.

Sommer **Mathis 21**, editor-in-chief of City Monitor; and Alexandra
Kanik, data reporter for City Monitor, 2/18/2021, \"Why you'll be
hearing a lot less about 'smart cities',\"
https://citymonitor.ai/government/budgets/why-youll-be-hearing-a-lot-less-about-smart-cities

We're not the first to argue that it may be time to retire the phrase
"smart cities", and the evidence of late suggests that the tech industry
itself is waking up to the reality that it needs to rethink what and how
it's trying to sell to local governments.

Smart cities surfaced as a concept more than 20 years ago and served as
an umbrella term to describe a large and varied set of emerging
technologies that seemed destined to help metros operate more
efficiently. The internet of things for municipalities has to date
included everything from simple sensors that allow transportation
engineers to track cycle lane usage to full-blown smart-city operations
centres that brought to mind scenes from Minority Report.

By the middle of the past decade, it was common to see vast sums of
grant funding made available to local governments that were keen to join
the innovation bandwagon. Smart-city challenges spurred metros of all
sizes to adopt new technologies, sometimes to the good but also, it now
seems clear, for the sake of becoming a member of the growing global
club of cutting-edge communities. Dozens if not hundreds of conferences,
marketplaces and expos emerged to showcase the latest gee-whiz gadgets
that cities could buy to transform themselves. To pursue a smart-city
strategy was to be seen as relevant and forward-thinking, whether or not
the problems a local government was aiming to solve would necessarily be
best served by an expensive new monitoring system or software package.

[**[Criticism]{.mark}** of the]{.underline} culture of the [smart city
[predates]{.mark} the [corona]{.mark}virus pandemic. [Concerns around
**privacy**]{.mark}, of who should own or control public data
[and]{.mark} to [what extent **tech**]{.mark}nology
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} always [[the **answer**]{.mark} could be heard
loud and clear]{.underline} at least a couple of years before Covid-19
changed the world. [[**Backlash** against]{.mark} the practices of
[companies]{.mark} like Amazon and Facebook [helped spur the]{.mark}
grassroots [movement that]{.mark} ultimately [contributed to]{.mark} the
**[cancellation]{.mark}** in]{.underline} May [[of
a]{.underline}]{.mark} major Sidewalk Labs
[[project]{.underline}]{.mark} in [Toronto. That [the]{.mark}
urban-innovations unit embedded within Google's parent company [cited
**economic uncertainty**]{.mark} amid the onset of the
pandemic]{.underline} as its reason for changing course was almost
beside the point -- the Quayside plan had already been scaled down so
significantly in the face of community pressure that its viability was
no longer clear.

[The pandemic took]{.underline} much of [the remaining air out of the
smart-cities bubble]{.underline}. Last summer, City Monitor reported
that more [[smart-city]{.mark} project deployment[s would be]{.mark}
**delayed** or **[scrapped]{.mark}** in the face of budget and revenue
uncertainty]{.underline}, and that [city governments were in the midst
of shifting their priorities towards economic recovery and digital
equity]{.underline}. Since then, one of the industry's biggest players,
Cisco, announced it would pull the plug on its flagship smart-city
software.

"Obviously, a lot has changed. In this moment, the big vendors are in
the midst of a pivot," says Nigel Jacob, co-chair and co-founder of the
Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics, a civic-innovation incubator and
R&D lab within Boston's city hall. "They've all seen the challenges and
the opportunities in this pandemic moment. We work very closely with
some big companies, and I think they are still struggling and looking at
their product portfolio and looking to see what value they can add. I do
think the field has shifted.

"When I look at some of the products that are coming from the large
vendors, they were all being developed in the context of normal
operating procedures. And that just isn't true anymore, and maybe never
again?"

The pandemic's effects on the smart-cities sector

A City Monitor analysis of global smart-city deployments makes it clear
that the eruption of [[Covid]{.underline}]{.mark}-19 in 2020 [[did
**stall**]{.mark} **the sector's [momentum]{.mark}**. The cumulative
number of these projects initiated worldwide increased significantly
between 2011 and 2019. By 2019, there were 379 fully deployed smart-city
projects in 61 countries. In 2020, just 16 countries set in motion a
total of 34]{.underline}.

[The trend becomes **even clearer** when broken down by region. Europe
has long led the way in terms of]{.underline} the quantity of
[smart-city deployments. Project commencements rose swiftly in Europe
between 2011 and 2016, from only two to 43 initiated annually. Since
2016, Europe has added 149.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, [the country with the most deployments to date is the US with
79]{.underline}. The larger North America region has 90.

Both [Europe and North America saw **significant dips** in the number of
smart-city deployments in 2020]{.underline}, while other regions
remained a bit steadier.

Australia, Germany and Italy were the only countries that had more
smart-city deployments in 2020 than they did in 2019. Australia had the
most of any country in 2020 -- seven -- up from six in 2019. It's
notable here that Australia is one of the few countries that have been
able to control the spread of Covid-19.

When examined through the lens of the major suppliers to
government-funded smart-city projects, 2020 looks even more like a sea
change.

Of the top five global suppliers of such undertakings, only one deployed
any in 2020.

The case against the phrase

A further obstacle to the global movement towards smart cities may be
the name itself. Even before the pandemic, it wasn't a particularly
descriptive term. What does it actually mean, which technologies count
as "smart", and why did this sector deserve so much attention? These
questions were all present prior to 2020. In 2021, the idea that the
goal of every city should be to get smarter feels painfully out of
touch.

This isn't to suggest that no useful or important smart technologies
have been deployed over the past decade. Many are clearly here to stay.
There's a great deal of consensus at this point, for example, that
intelligent street-lighting systems combined with LED bulbs -- which
enable cities to brighten or dim street lamps based on usage -- are both
cost-effective and vastly more sustainable. It's also clear that no city
will be able to meaningfully tackle its emissions goals without the
widespread adoption of smart meters and digitised grids.

But as with so many other aspects of life on our planet over the past
year, it is starting to feel like the end of an era.

"Part of it is that [[people are **sick** of]{.mark} talking about this
term, ['**smart cities'**]{.mark}]{.underline}," says Story Bellows, a
partner at the urban-change management consultancy Cityfi. "[People are
more focused now on creating outcomes]{.underline} in their communities,
whether that's using technology, whether that's reinventing processes --
kind of the layering of all of those various approaches to making
meaningful change on key indicators, whether it's on health or equity or
whatever it is. I think there are still a lot of potential technology
drivers and contributors in that, but [creating a business model of
smart cities]{.underline} just on its own, especially within some of
these really big companies, [**[it's hard to]{.mark} really
operationalise** and **[execute]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

#### AND [aren't sustainable]{.underline}.

[The \"smart city\" sounds like a digital utopia]{.underline}, a place
where data eliminates first-world hassles, dangers and injustices. [But
there are some **[problems with smart cities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and
no one, to my knowledge at least, has pointed them out. [Press coverage
from]{.underline} Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian and
dozens of other [publications are **gleefully optimistic** about smart
cities. No more traffic! Renewable energy for all! Fewer]{.underline}
fires and [disease outbreaks!]{.underline} Billions in savings!
Automated vegetable gardens on roofs! These are all real possibilities.
[**Before** we get too excited]{.underline}, however, [let's examine
the]{.underline} ingredients of a smart city and what they indicate
about those [**problems**.]{.underline}

**[[Sensory Overload]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[Smart cities are based on data]{.mark}. If you want data, [you need
**sensors**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It's not like roads, buildings and
street lights will wake up magically and start chatting about the
weather. We need sensors to see, hear, smell, taste and feel on their
behalf. [A platform can then aggregate all their data]{.underline} and
use it to make (or propose) decisions at speeds exceeding human
capacity. Sensors will measure temperature, traffic patterns, foot
traffic, air quality and infrastructure integrity (e.g., is the bridge
safe?), among many other things. Lux Research, an innovation research
and advisory firm, has a report that suggests the world will deploy 1
trillion sensors by 2020. Let\'s put that in perspective: If you have 1
million people deploying sensors, each person needs to deploy a million
of them within three years.

**[The De-Energizer Bunny]{.underline}**

[The U.S. alone buys over 3 billion batteries a year. [We have **not**
built 1 trillion batteries in]{.mark} the [history]{.mark} of humankind,
yet we're supposed to make enough batteries to power 1 trillion sensors
within three years? I doubt it. [Even if we could]{.mark} manufacture
batteries at that scale, [the resulting **pollution** and]{.mark}
**energy [consumption]{.mark}** would **[offset]{.mark} many of the
[benefits]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And tell me, [who would monitor and
replace the batteries in, say, 1 million public sensors scattered
throughout New York City?]{.underline} Even the Energizer Bunny
wouldn\'t get on board with that. Let's say we ditch the batteries and
connect sensors to wires instead. [[Installing **1 trillion wires**
is]{.mark} **prohibitively [expensive]{.mark}**. Whether you power those
sensors with solar, nuclear or fossil fuel energy, transmitting power
from its source to a device is impractical]{.underline}.

**[Problem No. 1]{.underline}**

The first problem with a smart city is power. [We want to install
millions of sensors that can retrieve useful, potentially life-saving
data. Yet with our current energy paradigms, [we **can't** power **1
trillion** devices, let alone a **million** in a]{.mark} single
[city]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus, **[[the smart city is a sci-fi
fantasy]{.mark} without wireless power]{.underline}** (i.e., power at a
distance). Is our utopia dead in the water, then? No. There are
companies (including ours) developing wireless power that resembles the
functionality of Wi-Fi but for power. We can solve the problem as
quickly as societies unwire power distribution. Once sensors receive
power wirelessly, we've cleared the main obstacle to a smart city. We
can then ask practical questions: How do we mitigate rush-hour traffic
based on the data? How do we reduce particulate matter in our indoor and
outdoor air? Where are pollutants coming from and how might we stop
them? How do we prevent meat contamination at a nearby food processing
plant from becoming a city-wide health crisis? Initially, we'll retrofit
cities with sensors. Eventually, we'll construct smart cities from
scratch because our existing road systems, zoning patterns and power
grids aren't made for automated, data-driven lifestyles. Autonomous
cars, for instance, have different needs than the manual gas guzzlers
around which we have designed our infrastructure.

**[Problem No. 2]{.underline}**

As we design smart cities around the data we want instead of the wiring
we have, the dialogue gets more complex. Mass data aggregation will
establish some truths (the source of certain problems) about how our
cities run. It will lead us to score cities on different quality-of-life
metrics. And that brings us to the toughest question of all: What do we
value in a human habitat? [That raises the second problem with a smart
city: **[We could create]{.mark} a [dystopia]{.mark} just [as easily
as]{.mark} we could create a [utopia]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
dividing line is deceivingly thin. We [assume that by tapping into the
collective intelligence of both devices and people we can create better
living environments.]{.underline} I believe we can. But [data is not a
magical cure to all our woes.]{.underline} To quote author and
entrepreneur Derek Sivers, "If \[more\] information was the answer, then
we'd all be billionaires with perfect abs." Likewise, if urban data was
the answer, then collecting it would eliminate traffic, poverty, crime,
etc. That's dangerously optimistic. [**[We'll need leaders to]{.mark}
interpret and [use the data wisely]{.mark}**. Too often, our [officials
pass along data like **hors d\'oeuvres**]{.mark}, expecting
[people]{.mark} to [take]{.mark} only [what nourishes their
worldview]{.mark}.]{.underline} That's not good enough. [Smart cities
will need leaders who have the courage to defend their data, say what it
means and establish it as a truth upon which cities make decisions. If
officials don\'t stand behind their data, neither will the
public.]{.underline}

#### Backlash prevents city development.

New York Times, Conde Nast Travelar, and many other publications, author
of *The Wonder of Bird: What they Tell Us About the World, Ourselves,

While proponents say these communities represent the future of a
healthier planet, some prominent [**smart cities** have faced **serious
obstacles** to realizing their utopian visions. **Masdar City** in Abu
Dhabi abandoned its **smart city**]{.underline} master [**plan** because
of **financial problems**]{.underline} that began in 2008 [and continued
because the cost of some aspects of the city was **far more** than
forecast. Songdo is a completed smart city with a population of 170,000
in South Korea that has **not** been able to fill its buildings.
It's]{.underline} sometimes described as [a **ghost town**]{.underline},
or, variously, as [cold, impersonal, homogenous, and dully
predictable]{.underline}.

One recent paper on smart cites grappled with ways these cities can
introduce serendipity into daily life to combat their monotonous nature.

"There are a lot of good things that can come of" **[smart city
concepts]{.underline}**, "especially for the environmental
applications," said Shannon Mattern, a professor of anthropology at The
New School for Social Research and the author of A City is Not a
Computer. "But it [really limits your \[ways\] of intervention to the
types of things that lend themselves to quantitative
measurement]{.underline}," she said. "When you take messy ambiguous
dimensions of human nature and try to find ways to algorithmicize them,
there is always a failure there, something that slips through the
cracks." [**History**, **culture**, and the **spiritual aspects** of
life are among]{.underline} those [aspects that critics cite as missing
from]{.underline} --- or are diminished --- in **[smart
cities]{.underline}**.

There has been [criticism]{.underline}, as well, [of smart cities being
**alien** to the **landscape** on which they are built]{.underline}. In
her book Spaceship in the Desert, about Masdar City, Gökçe Günel, an
anthropologist at Rice University, said both Masdar City and Neom "share
the vision that the desert is an empty zone on which any kind of ideal
can be projected," she said. "That's why I compared Masdar City to a
spaceship insulated from the rest of the world."

Despite the fact that trillions of dollars are being spent to create
these spectacular, Oz-like, all-encompassing cities of the future, some
leading analysts believe in a very different concept of smarter cities.

"I hate almost every effort at building a greenfield smart city," said
Boyd Cohen, a professor at EADA, a business school in Barcelona, who is
one of the pioneers of the smart city concept and a longtime climate
strategist. "A smart city without people is a dumb city. You are
building a smart city in the absence of people, in the absence of
history, in the absence of culture. The developers say, 'We are going to
build this great, amazing city and people will come,' and they don't.
People want to live in communities and have culture around them."

An alternative to a spanking new city rising on virgin land is to
incorporate smart technologies into existing cities, Cohen said.
Singapore, London, and Barcelona, are among the cities that lead the
world in adopting smart technologies to more efficiently operate their
infrastructure and become greener. In London, for example, sensors on
light poles monitor air pollution and show particularly polluted spots
that can be avoided. Because collecting trash is the most expensive part
of the waste disposal process, Barcelona adopted "smart bins" that
signal when they are full and ready for pick up. But technology is not
always a be-all and end-all.

Cohen believes cities are on the front line of climate change and need
to become smarter to survive it. "In 2009 \[at the UN climate conference
in Copenhagen\] everyone thought Obama and the United Nations were going
to save the world" with agreements to restrict CO2 emissions, he said.
"It didn't happen and still isn't happening. So I turned my attention to
cities. That's the place where we will get faster action on climate
change."

Urban planning, says Cohen, may be the single most important way to
reduce fossil fuel pollution and consumption. Effective urban design ---
density, walkability, mixed use so people don't have to drive long
distances, and efficient, clean electric or hydrogen public
transportation --- is the foundation. "Then you layer in tech," he said.
"Technology around renewable and distributed energy. And to make our
buildings more energy efficient. If you tackle energy consumption and
transportation and urban planning, you have gone a long way toward
solving the climate problem."

Smart grids are a key component of smart cities. These power grids
optimize the delivery of electricity by receiving information from users
over the IoT. This data provides experts with information about how,
where, and when energy is used. In some models, it interprets that data
with artificial intelligence. But as energy sources are diversified ---
solar and wind from large and small sources, even individual homes, as
well as traditional sources --- it makes it harder for electrical
systems to efficiently sense where power is needed and to allocate it.
Because it can better manage available power, a smart grid avoids waste
and can make the most of renewables.

A host of other smart applications are being used in cities. Parking is
the bane of urban dwellers, so smart parking has gotten a lot of
attention. Santander, Spain, for example, is considered one of the
world's smartest cities because it has 20,000 parking sensors connected
to the IoT. Sensors under parking spaces can tell when they are empty
and send that information to antennas that beam it to a control center.
Signs guide drivers to the empty spots, limiting time spent driving
around looking for a space and reducing fuel use, carbon dioxide and
automobile pollution, and traffic congestion.

In Utrecht in the Netherlands, people ride "sniffer bikes" that measure
three types of particulate air pollution, as well recording their
location, speed, battery voltage, temperature and humidity, road
conditions, and organic gases, which are sent to a central data hub.
People can choose the cleanest route and are themselves de facto
sensors, providing information to city managers.

Water use is another prime target of smart applications. A smartphone
app, for example, can alert residents to an undetected leak in their
plumbing and allows them to monitor consumption and quality.

Barcelona has pioneered a smart water irrigation system in its public
spaces. Officials inventoried the species of plants in each park and
determined precisely how much water they need. Water and humidity
sensors, coupled with data from weather stations and rain gauges,
provide information on how moist the soil and air are, and allow
delivery of the right amount of water. The city says it saves 25 percent
on its water bill --- more than 400,000 euros a year.

But [**smart cities** have run into **trouble** over the **issue** of
who owns the data that is collected and how it will be
used]{.underline}. A [Google affiliate]{.underline} called Sidewalk Labs
[had plans for a]{.underline} 12-acre [smart city
development]{.underline}, called Quayside, on Toronto's lakefront. [The
project ran into a **buzz saw** of **opposition**]{.underline}, largely
[over whether it could be trusted to **manage the data**]{.underline}.
Roger McNamee, a venture capitalist, wrote a letter to the city council
and said the information technology behemoth could not be trusted. "The
smart city project on the Toronto waterfront is the most highly evolved
version to date ... of surveillance capitalism," he wrote. The company
will use "algorithms to nudge human behavior" in the direction "that
favors its business."

Sidewalk Labs CEO Daniel L. Doctoroff said the 2020 cancellation of the
project was largely a result of the pandemic and economic uncertainty in
the Toronto real estate market. "It has become too difficult to make the
12-acre project financially viable without sacrificing core parts of the
plan," Doctoroff wrote last year.

It's clear that [the vision of]{.underline} what works as [a smart city
is still in the **early stages**]{.underline}, especially as technology
and concepts continue to evolve. "It will take time to scale up the most
sustainable models across a city, let alone the world," said Cohen.
