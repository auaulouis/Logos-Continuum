What has gone wrong? Two sources of dysfunction are central to the
current impasse:

The [first is **a mismatch**]{.underline} [between]{.underline} the
[checks and]{.underline} [balances]{.underline} [built into the U.S.
system]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the [**extreme polarization** now
separating]{.underline} the two major political parties. [By
constitutional]{.underline} [design]{.underline}, [U.S. policymaking
moves slowly]{.underline}; [the president cannot dictate]{.underline}
[what happens in Congress]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[legislators]{.underline} [use separate procedures]{.underline} in the
House and Senate [that then must be]{.underline} [reconciled to write
law.]{.underline} In the past, [eventual compromise]{.underline} [was
the standard outcome]{.underline}, [at least when]{.underline} [some
legislators]{.underline} [worked across party lines.]{.underline} **[Not
anymore.]{.underline}**

The [Democratic]{.underline} [and Republican]{.underline}
[parties]{.underline} **[have been moving apart
ideologically]{.underline}** since the 1970s, but [in the past 10 years
this **has dramatically accelerated**]{.underline}. For the first time
in the more than three decades since National Journal began compiling
vote ratings for the U.S. Senate, the tallies for the last Congress
showed that there was not a single Democrat more conservative than the
most liberal Republican; the center, in other words, cannot hold ---
because it has disappeared. Instead, American parties now resemble
parliamentary parties: [Party leaders crack the whip**, and fewer
members are willing to flout orders and compromise**]{.underline}.
**[The result: gridlock.]{.underline}**

[The second major]{.underline} [dysfunction]{.underline} [has to do with
the asymmetry]{.underline} [of]{.underline} this
[polarization]{.underline}. The Republican Party has become the home of
ideologically extreme insurgents who shun conventionally understood
facts, evidence, and science, and scorn the very idea of working out
compromises with a legitimate political opposition. This radicalized GOP
is now willing to use all the levers in the constitutional system even
if it means delay and deadlock.

In a parliamentary system, [a fiercely oppositional minority party is to
be expected]{.underline}. In the American system, **[it cannot
work]{.underline}**. [With]{.underline} the [Republicans]{.underline}
[deciding to use the filibuster]{.underline} in the Senate as a routine
tool of obstruction (they have resorted to the filibuster with a
frequency in the last three years unprecedented in U.S. history),
[passing legislation]{.underline} [now in effect]{.underline}
[requires]{.underline} [not a majority but **60 votes out of
100.**]{.underline} What's more, [any legislation]{.underline} [that
manages to pass under those conditions]{.underline}, [taken without
broad bipartisan consensus]{.underline}, **[divides the
country]{.underline}** [and is seen by many as **illegitimate or
ill-advised**]{.underline}. That is the story of Barack Obama's first
two years in office. Democrats, who were in charge of both the House and
Senate, pushed through a wide range of measures from health-care reform
to economic stimulus to financial regulation, but the minority made a
concerted effort to delegitimize them.

What came after was even worse: The 2010 midterm elections produced a
divided-party government, genuine gridlock, and the least productive
Congress in memory. This year saw the enactment of only 83 laws, a
quarter of them naming post offices or making other symbolic acts. Of
course, quality is more important than quantity (whatever else the
famous \"do-nothing\" 80th Congress did, it passed the Marshall Plan).
In the case of this 112th Congress, however, the quality is as abysmal
as the quantity; the most significant public-policy action was the
debacle surrounding the debt ceiling, which resulted in the first
credit-rating downgrade in America's history. Now, following that
reckless hostage-taking of what should have been a standard legislative
act, a totally unnecessary \"fiscal cliff\" looms, threatening another
recession. The problems here are not redeemable with quick fixes because
the divisions are tribal and the problems are as much cultural as
structural.

[This lethal combination of forces]{.underline} **[has serious
implications]{.underline} not** [just for America's ability to solve its
problems**; it also poisons America's standing in the
world**]{.underline} --- [**its ability to project its values abroad,
garner the trust and respect of allies, and serve as a role model for
nascent democracies and a counterpoint to autocracies**.]{.underline}

#### Partisanship and the news cycle destroy effective threats.

[Research]{.underline} on this question, [supplemented]{.underline} [by
interviews]{.underline} with leading policymakers, [offer
details]{.underline} [that reveal ho]{.underline}w
[profoundly]{.underline} the [policymaking]{.underline} environment [has
been]{.underline} altered.(30)

First[, there are ever **fewer centrists** elected]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} [Congress]{.underline} [from either major
party]{.underline}, [and those that remain]{.underline}
[find]{.underline} **[few electoral incentives]{.underline}** [for
taking tough votes]{.underline} [on international policy.]{.underline}
Consequently, [there are fewer Members]{.underline} [prepared to place
**institutional prerogatives over partisan politics**]{.underline}. In
the late 1980s, there were a dozen liberal Republicans to 'the left' of
conservative Democrats, often from southern states, and vice versa. In
the last Congress, the most conservative senator in the Democratic
caucus, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, was still ranked as more liberal
than the most moderate Republican, Susan Collins of Maine.(31) Those who
challenge party orthodoxy, or who reach across the political aisle to
support a bipartisan compromise---or to defend the institutional
prerogatives of Congress---are at greater risk of being defeated. As a
consequence, [Members]{.underline} [of both parties have]{.underline}
[adopted]{.underline} [a classic '**blame avoidance'**]{.underline}
[strategy]{.underline} [to **dodge difficult votes**]{.underline} [while
reserving the ability to blame the President for foreign initiatives
gone awry]{.underline}.(32) In fact, several powerful Senate Foreign
Relations Committee chairmen have lost their re-election bids. The list
includes William Fulbright of Arkansas, Frank Church of Idaho and
Charles Percy of Illinois. Many incumbents now fear primary election
challenges more than general elections. Primary voters defeated relative
moderates such as Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Richard
Lugar (R-IN) in 2010, while Trump critic Bob Corker, a popular Tennessee
Republican retired unexpectedly in 2019. The muchnoted 'sorting out' of
parties has significantly increased party-line voting while
dis-incentivizing would-be champions of the institution of Congress.(33)
This has occurred most notably on domestic issues such as health
care---not a single Republican voted for Obamacare, even after Democrats
accepted scores of GOP-sponsored amendments. Stimulus spending and tax
cuts also became party-line votes in the House. Yet, [it]{.underline}
also [happened on issues like the Iran nuclear pact]{.underline},
[where]{.underline} [Republicans voted en bloc]{.underline} [against an
agreement]{.underline} [that had been supported by U.S]{.underline}. and
Israeli military and intelligence leaders, [five United Nations Security
Council partners, including]{.underline} [key European
allies]{.underline}, as well as Russia and China[. This party-line
voting]{.underline} on security matters [and the failure to defend
institutional prerogatives]{.underline} "[makes it easier for future
administrations]{.underline} **[to just ignore the will of
Congress]{.underline}**," Senator Chris Coons (D-DE) observes, "[it
means there'll be less and less bipartisanship in defending
Congress]{.underline}.(34)

In this hyper-polarized legislative environment, **[bipartisan
coalitions]{.underline}** [**to sustain** Washington's
international]{.underline} [**policy** **initiatives**]{.underline}
**[are very difficult to achieve]{.underline}**. [This **harms U.S.
national security interests**.]{.underline} Former GOP Chairwoman
Ros-Lehtinen graphically describes the difficulty of passing even a
routine State Department authorization in this environment: "The House
Foreign Affairs Committee mark-up on the State Department funding bill
suffered from dozens of amendments that were simply about social
engineering and political messaging. When you try to bring a bill like
that to the floor, with so many divisive social issues, you get a 'No'
from leadership."(35) [Similarly]{.underline}, [nonpartisan]{.underline}
[efforts to defend the]{.underline} [institution of
Congress]{.underline} **[have been weakened]{.underline}**. As one
former House leader and veteran appropriator, Vic Fazio of California,
recently testified, "The job of the minority is now to make sure that
the governing majority accomplishes little or nothing."(36)

[A second factor in]{.underline} [Capitol Hill's decline]{.underline}
[has been the **twenty-four-hour news cycle**]{.underline} and the rise
of social media. [Both have made nuanced positioning]{.underline} [on
breaking foreign]{.underline} [developments more difficult]{.underline}.
[Flip comments]{.underline} by inveterate Twitter users **[crowd out
more thoughtful analysis]{.underline}**. [Hard line
positions]{.underline} **[are rewarded by voters]{.underline}** [and
locked in early]{.underline} [by earned media coverage]{.underline}. The
President of the United States boasted by Tweet in 2019 about nominating
a poorly qualified, controversial Director of National Intelligence,
then counting on the press to 'vet' him after the presidential
announcement.(37) [Legislators]{.underline} also [spend far less time in
Washington working together]{.underline}. Bipartisan CODELS
("congressional delegations") making fact-finding missions overseas,
have been cut back. In the Senate, leaders have doubled the number of
committee assignments while reducing the number of substantive bills
given consideration. Consequently, recent research has shown, that there
is greater policy diversification and less specialization.(38)
Legislators are increasingly generalists, fewer are specialists in
foreign or defense policy. [The development of policymaking
expertise]{.underline}, **[especially in foreign policy]{.underline}**,
an area deemed of less interest to voters, [is punished rather than
rewarded]{.underline}. In addition, term limits on committee chairs---a
reform initiative from decades past---has further reduced the
development of expertise necessary to stand up to a unified executive
branch front led by the President.

A third factor is that the marquee foreign policymaking committees,
panels that once wielded the power to check presidents, have themselves
declined. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is Exhibit A here. The
committee was once a panel led by vigorous challengers to presidential
authority. William Fulbright used it to build a national case against
the Vietnam War expanded by his political ally, fellow southern Democrat
Lyndon Johnson. Frank Church used the panel to build the case for
nuclear arms control and the Panama Canal treaties, while checking CIA
excesses. Republican Jesse Helms pressed from his leadership position on
the panel to curb U.S. support for international organizations.(39) Such
was the high esteem of the panel that Senator Jack Kennedy's father,
eager to prepare for the 1960 presidential contrast, implored
then-Senate Majority Leader LBJ to grant his son a seat on the panel in
the 1950s, blocking a more senior political rival, Estes Kefauver.

In the last Congress, the committee was led by a quiet isolationist from
Idaho, Jim Risch, who is not held in high regard by foreign policy
experts on both sides of the aisle. The Senate panel that once seated
Dick Lugar, John Kerry, Chuck Hagel and Barack Obama still attracts
White House aspirants. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and
Marco Rubio of Florida all joined the panel prior to their own
presidential campaigns. But this panel, and its House counterpart, are
now deemed by most legislators less desirable than in previous eras. The
House committee still attracts some legislators committed to a strong
institutional role for Congress. But [it also has Members
enamored]{.underline} [of foreign travel and well-supported by interest
groups with a stake in international matters.]{.underline} In the House,
where Members face voters every two years and are more tied to parochial
districts, getting Members to serve on the Foreign Affairs Committee has
been a challenge for party leaders.(40)

The reason why these two key [authorizing committees]{.underline} have
**[lost much of their luster]{.underline}** **[and influence is
clear]{.underline}**: **[they rarely pass any significant
legislation]{.underline}**. In fact, few major committees of Congress
act less on legislation. With no significant treaties coming before the
Senate in the last decade, the Foreign Relations panel garners less
public and press attention. With no authorization debates, it has
legislative power over fewer funds and programs. In the void left by
decades of failing to pass even an annual authorization bill for the
State Department, the committees and their public education functions,
even their champions and leaders concede, are less relevant.(41) Today
the work of the House and Senate foreign affairs committees, which
employ several dozen senior staff experts on bilateral relationships and
regional security challenges, is often "eviscerated by four
appropriations subcommittee clerks, who are not foreign policy experts,"
as one veteran legislator laments.(42) It should be noted, [this
phenomenon obtains on **most legislation**]{.underline}**,** not just on
national security matters.

## General Pressure Answers

### Pressure CP\-\--Fails\-\--Top Level

#### Pressure [fails]{.underline}\-\--[politics]{.underline} and [self-interests]{.underline}.

//EM

2\) [European countries **pay more**]{.underline} in defense
**[overhead]{.underline}** --- [All armed forces require]{.underline}
military **[bases]{.underline}**, [**training** facilities,
and]{.underline} **[administrative support]{.underline}**. [So in a
continent with **several small**]{.underline}, national armed
[forces]{.underline}, [overhead necessarily **absorbs** a **higher
fraction** of resources than in the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.

[A solution]{.underline} for Europe [would be to **share**]{.underline}
some [**military assets** and functions]{.underline}. In recent years,
there have been important bilateral and multilateral initiatives in this
respect --- but [there are strong **political limits** as
well.]{.underline}

[Countries have **no guarantees** their partners]{.underline} ultimately
[will **support them** in a military crisis]{.underline}.
[Thus]{.underline}, if sharing turns into a lock-in, [countries **run
the risk** of having **access** to fewer]{.underline} military
[capabilities]{.underline} than they might need. This explains why the
width and depth of past initiatives have been generally limited.

However, [this comes at the cost of **intra-alliance inefficiency**
and]{.underline} thus an [**inferior capacity** to generate
military]{.underline} [capabilities]{.underline}. An E.U. Defense Union
could address these problems, but efforts to set this up face many of
the same challenges: Why should a country tie its destiny to others? How
can it ensure that its interests will be respected? And what tangible
benefits would it observe in the short term, beside loss of jobs and
income, following base closures and defense industry consolidation?

3\) [Implementing]{.underline} defense [cooperation in Europe **won't be
easy**]{.underline} --- Some [analysts think that by **promoting
cooperation**]{.underline} [among NATO allies]{.underline},
[any]{.underline} U.S. [**retrenchment** from Europe would help
**address existing problems**]{.underline}, but there are strong reasons
to be skeptical.

[With Europe's **limited funds** to spend]{.underline} on defense,
[large **cooperative projects** will be **difficult to
launch**]{.underline}. In the past, [countries in Europe
abandoned]{.underline} cooperative [projects because of their
**negative**]{.underline} domestic [**implications for
jobs**,]{.underline} [technological know-how or]{.underline} military
[exports]{.underline}. In an age of austerity, amid a refugee crisis and
high youth unemployment, this mind-set is unlikely to change anytime
soon.

And [some countries]{.underline} may [have **little interest** in
cooperation]{.underline}. [They may **operate in completely different
environments**]{.underline} --- [**Mediterranean** vs. **North
Sea,**]{.underline} for example. [Or they **perceive**]{.underline} a
[different **strategic threat**]{.underline} at home --- [think Russia
vs. the Islamic State]{.underline}. [Some countries]{.underline} may
[even have a strategic interest in leaving **unaddressed**]{.underline}
some [capability gaps]{.underline} --- [to compel **proximate allies**
to come to their defense]{.underline}. This was Finland's military
strategy during the Cold War.

### Pressure CP\-\--Fails

#### Threatening to [cut-off]{.underline} aid pushes countries [closer]{.underline} to Russia and [fails]{.underline} to create [concessions]{.underline} for the US.

Affairs at American University's School of International Service and a

"President Trump wants to pressure allies by cutting foreign aid. That
never works." Washington Post. 8-25-2017.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/08/25/president-trump-wants-to-pressure-allies-by-cutting-foreign-aid-that-never-works/
//EM

In his speech this week on his plans for the U.S. military presence in
Afghanistan, President [Trump said he will use the **threat of
withdrawing**]{.underline} foreign aid [to]{.underline} [put
**pressure** on Pakistan to **better support** the American
mission]{.underline}. [Despite]{.underline} proposing [**dramatic cuts**
to the State Department and]{.underline} U.S. Agency for International
Development budgets, the Trump administration still requested \$740
million in foreign aid for Pakistan, so this threat carries significant
weight. Then, [just one day later]{.underline}, [**news broke** that
the]{.underline} State [Department is **withholding** \$195 million
in]{.underline} military [aid for Egypt]{.underline} and has revoked
another \$95 million in foreign aid, [**seeming proof** that we are
**willing to use aid as leverage**]{.underline}.

But history shows that foreign aid is a poor way to get what we want.
[**Threatening to cut off aid is almost certain to fail** in
bringing]{.underline} about [**political change** in]{.underline} Egypt,
Pakistan or [any country that the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has a **strategic interest** in
**supporting**]{.underline}.

[U.S. **foreign aid** has]{.underline} long [been held out as a
**carrot** to **reward countries** that embrace democracy]{.underline}
and free markets. For example, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a
foreign aid agency created under George W. Bush, awards funds only to
countries that are undertaking liberal political and economic reforms.
During the Cold War, increased aid was also offered as a potential
reward to failing states such as El Salvador. During a visit there by
then-Vice President George H.W. Bush at the height of the country's
civil war, [El Salvador was **promised** a **massive increase**
in]{.underline} military [assistance in **exchange** for]{.underline}
[the **removal of military leaders** suspected of]{.underline}
**[h]{.underline}**uman **[r]{.underline}**ights [abuses
and]{.underline} [**greater restraint** by the
government-aligned]{.underline} "death squad [terrorists]{.underline}"
[who had killed thousands]{.underline}. While death squad killings did
decline, the lull in violence was short lived. According to Human Rights
Watch, there were 1,900 political killings and disappearances in El
Salvador only a year after Bush's visit. Promises of aid didn't stop the
violence, but Congress still approved the Reagan administration's \$61.7
million aid request to resupply the Salvadoran military, which was
apparently running out of bullets.

[The **cutoff of aid** has]{.underline} also [been used as a
**stick**]{.underline} --- [either **threatened or
enforced**]{.underline} --- [to **motivate** countries to get back on
track with]{.underline} U.S. [objectives]{.underline}. In 2010, [U.S.
military aid to several]{.underline} Pakistani [military units was cut
as punishment for]{.underline} **[h]{.underline}**uman
**[r]{.underline}**ights [abuses]{.underline}, [including at least
300]{.underline} [**extrajudicial executions** in the Swat
Valley]{.underline}. In a war for "hearts and minds," killing civilians
doesn't help. But the Obama administration undermined the impact of the
cuts by simultaneously negotiating a \$2 billion counterterrorism
package with Pakistan. The following year, the Obama administration
suspended 40 percent of the \$2 billion package in an attempt to secure
greater cooperation from the Pakistani military in fighting against the
Taliban --- the very same thing Trump threatened.

Why does aid fail to change governments' behavior? [One of the reasons
is that we give most of our foreign aid to countries that
are]{.underline} strategically [important]{.underline} to the United
States --- nations like Egypt and Pakistan. [We need their **continued
cooperation**]{.underline} on a range of issues, [and this]{.underline}
ultimately [**limits the amount of pressure** we can apply.]{.underline}
Sometimes [there are developments **beyond our control**]{.underline}.
[Restrictions on foreign aid to Indonesia were **eased**]{.underline} in
2005 [after a **tsunami devastated** parts of the country]{.underline}.
Other times, the cuts in aid are too small to matter. In 2015, \$5
million in aid was withheld from Mexico after the summary execution of
22 suspected gang members during the country's ongoing drug war. But
that amounted to 15 percent of U.S. support for the Mexican police and
military under the Merida Initiative. The Mexican military continues to
support local police forces, recently killing 17 in a firefight, which
suggests that little has changed in the Mexican government's strategy.

Often, [**cutting aid** is]{.underline} simply [**not enough** to force
change]{.underline}. In Mali, the [Obama administration
**suspended**]{.underline} \$70 million in [bilateral aid]{.underline}
--- roughly half of U.S. aid to the country --- [after a 2012
coup]{.underline}. [The State Department said **aid would resume** at
**normal levels**]{.underline} [once]{.underline} democratic [rule was
restored]{.underline}. The coup leader stepped down, but the military
remained in power. Presidential elections were held more than a year
later, after French military intervention in the country.

[Pressuring countries through **foreign aid** can]{.underline} also
[**drive them away** from the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. [This **fear was strongest** during the Cold
War]{.underline}, [when the Soviet Union was]{.underline} actively
**[competing for influence]{.underline}** in developing countries, [but
it's **still very real**]{.underline}. In the Philippines, President
Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs has led to thousands of deaths. In
response, the U.S. postponed millions of dollars in foreign aid. Duterte
also rejected \$280 million in aid from the European Union because it
was pressuring him to improve human rights conditions. Aid can no longer
buy political influence in the Philippines.

#### Non-escalatory is critical to get allies to agree

America Still Protect Its Allies?"
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2019-08-12/can-america-still-protect-its-allies>\]

A sanctions-based strategy would be judicious and proportionate, but it
would not be weak. Indeed, if Beijing or Moscow refused to either back
down or otherwise resolve the dispute once the United States and its
allies had deployed sanctions, Washington could raise the stakes.
Recognizing that the aggressor state's strategic aims had become
fundamentally untrustworthy or hostile, Washington could seek to not
only punish the perpetrator for its specific action but also limit its
future economic growth. Over time, export controls and permanent
sanctions could replace temporary punitive measures. [[This]{.mark}
strategy would [**require support** from]{.mark} key **U.S.
[allies]{.mark}** to be effective]{.underline}---one more reason why
[[Washington needs to]{.mark} respond to]{.underline} these kinds of
[crises in a way that [seem]{.mark}s [**judicious**, **patient**, and
**non-escalatory**]{.mark}, so as [to **strengthen its coalition** and
not **scare**]{.mark} **away**]{.underline} key
[[partners]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Pressure CP\-\--Fails\-\--Spending

#### European countries will not [increase]{.underline} defense commitments [unliterally]{.underline}.

President [Trump's reassurances]{.underline} last week to U.K. Prime
Minister Theresa May [that the]{.underline} North American Treaty
Organization ([NATO) was]{.underline} not, in fact,
**["obsolete"]{.underline}** [are **unlikely** to have Europe **taking
up more**]{.underline} of the [defense burden]{.underline}, at least [in
the **short term**]{.underline}.

As discussed here in the Monkey Cage, national security adviser Michael
T. Flynn wants to see other NATO members pay more of the cost of
defending Europe. [It's not a **new pitch**]{.underline}, [but such
calls **neglect** the **budgetary**]{.underline}, [**financial** and
**political barriers** to enhanced]{.underline} military [capabilities
in Europe]{.underline}.

And such barriers will remain in place even if European countries
succeed in implementing ambitious defense plans that include active
measures to strengthen defense cooperation, endow the E.U. with defense
capabilities and launch a common research fund.

Trump's national security adviser wants to water down U.S. NATO
commitments

The transatlantic gap in military capabilities --- how much defense
output the two sides of the Atlantic are able to generate, respectively
--- has three main causes that cannot easily be addressed:

1\) European [countries have **limited**]{.underline} defense
[budgets]{.underline} --- On average, [defense expenditure in Europe is
**just over 1 percent of GDP**]{.underline}, [while the U.S.
defense]{.underline} budget [is well **above 4 percent**]{.underline} of
GDP. [Would a U.S. **retrenchment** push]{.underline} [European
allies]{.underline} to [fix **this imbalance**]{.underline}, [and bring
NATO members]{.underline} [**closer** to the 2 percent]{.underline}
[threshold]{.underline} they pledged to move toward in 2014?

Maybe. But [half of NATO's members are **small**]{.underline} countries
[with **small defense budgets**]{.underline}, well below \$2 billion per
year. Thus, a [**substantial bump** in their]{.underline} military
[spending **won't bring** about a]{.underline} significant [**increase**
in Europe's]{.underline} overall [military **investments**.]{.underline}
Estonia's 2 percent GDP defense expenditure amounts to just \$500
million, for instance. That might pay for the operational costs of a few
of middle-sized U.S. warships, but [wouldn't **push back** a **Russian
invasion**]{.underline}.

### Pressure CP\-\--Turn

#### Threatening allies creates [extended]{.underline} fears AND [collapses]{.underline} deterrence.

Conclusions Regarding Inducements

**[Inducements]{.underline}** of any type **[are neither necessary nor
sufficient for success]{.underline}**. [Neither limited]{.underline}
nonmilitary [rewards **nor full-scale**]{.underline} military
**[reassurance]{.underline}** [led to success in the Taiwan]{.underline}
and South Korean [cases]{.underline}. [The **provision** of]{.underline}
limited military [reassurance]{.underline} likewise **[failed to lead to
success]{.underline}** in Pakistan and Israel. As noted, it remains to
be investigated if massive military reassurance can stop low-dependence
allies.

The U.S. offered full military reassurance to [South Korea]{.underline}
by promising to defend it with nuclear weapons. To [Taiwan]{.underline},
the U.S. only offered limited non-military rewards, such as renewal of
licenses for Taipei's civilian nuclear power reactors. [From these
two]{.underline} complete success [cases]{.underline}, [the **conclusion
can be drawn** that **inducements** do not play as **significant a
role**]{.underline} [for **highly-dependent** allies as the
**scholarship** on incentives **leads us to expect**]{.underline}. The
logic of the literature suggests that provision of military reassurance,
rather than non-military rewards, should increase the chances of success
because such inducements are more likely to undercut the ally's
insecurity that impelled it to pursue the NWP. In other words, [the
incentives that **satisfy an ally's current** and future]{.underline}
security [needs are more **likely to persuade** it to abandon the future
gains it hopes to enjoy]{.underline} if it persists and is ultimately
successful in making its nuclear weapons program operational. However,
inducements did not play significant roles in either Taiwan or South
Korea. Taiwan was forced into submission when it was offered minimal
non-military rewards. Having politically abandoned Taipei, the U.S. made
little effort to reassure it of its future intentions; furthermore,
having promised non-military rewards, Washington provided them
inconsistently.14 The Taiwan case thus suggests that in the cases of the
most acute dependence by an ally, the U.S. can economize on incentives
and achieve success primarily by coercive denial.

The [South Korean case is **unique** in that the U.S. made]{.underline}
two **[public]{.underline}**, high-level [**pledges** to defend it
with]{.underline} **[nuc]{.underline}**lear weapon**[s]{.underline}**.
[Both of these features]{.underline} (public and high-level) [made the
pledges]{.underline} highly [**credible** because the U.S. was **issuing
a direct warning**]{.underline} to the Soviets and the North Koreans
[about the **consequences**]{.underline} [of an attack on South
Korea]{.underline}. As noted previously, the strength of this military
reassurance becomes clear once we compare it to the U.S. approach to the
ArabIsraeli conflict. In that case, President Kennedy made a
diplomatically "balanced" statement, speaking for the security interests
of both parties, which, as could be expected, failed to reassure the
Israelis.

The failure of these public and high-level military guarantees to change
the South Koreans' minds was surprising. Military reassurance did not
work because in 1978 Seoul still engaged in negotiations with France
about purchasing the reprocessing facility. President Carter's coercion
by export controls was necessary to stop this renewed attempt in its
tracks. Donald Gregg\'s account helpfully illustrates this point by
describing the failure of an earlier reassurance attempt: \"The visit to
Seoul of President Ford and Henry Kissinger, in the fall of 1974, en
route to a meeting with the Soviet leadership in Vladivostok, was very
reassuring to Park, and the relationship was stabilized. The nuclear
program was stopped later on, when South Korea had to go abroad to
purchase items that it could not produce itself \[thus making itself
vulnerable to coercion by export controls\]\" (Gregg 2013, emphasis
added). In sum, South Korea was the only case in which the U.S.
explicitly pledged to strengthen its deterrent for an ally, and this
military reassurance failed alone to bring about a nuclear change of
heart in Seoul.

[For Pakistan and Israel]{.underline}, [Washington chose to **provide
only limited**]{.underline} military **[reassurance]{.underline}**
(selected **[military aid)]{.underline}** [to strengthen their
**defensive capabilities**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} equally
[**unequivocally refused** to provide anything approaching a
**deterrent** capability]{.underline} that both states repeatedly
requested. [The U.S. knew that the arms it offered to **Pakistan** would
not even allow it to **balance**]{.underline}---[let alone,
**deter**]{.underline}---**[India]{.underline}**.15 The Israeli case
also shows that the Kennedy Administration drew a clear line between a
defensive buildup to bring Jerusalem to the point of parity with its
Arab adversaries and massive military aid that Israel requested that
could have allowed Israel to deter its enemies.

obvious that [the **threat** is **hollow**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To be
sure, the United States has drawn down most of its huge pre-positioned
force from the Cold War days. But [[there\'s]{.mark} simply [no
question]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[we\'ll respond **rapidly** in the
event an ally is]{.mark} seriously [threatened. So long as]{.mark} the
[Europeans know]{.mark} that\'s true, [they\'re **unlikely** to
**change**]{.mark} their **[behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Reassurances [undermines pressure]{.underline}

Program at The German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF). As a
foreign policy analyst, his research focuses on European integration and

POLITICS OF 2 PERCENT: NATO and the Security Vacuum in Europe",
https://carnegieendowment.org/files/CP_252_Techau_NATO_Final.pdf)

And [so the dilemma remains: [Europeans are]{.mark} still
[dependent]{.mark}]{.underline} on U.S. services for their security,
[[and]{.mark} they are **[not]{.mark} too [bothered]{.mark}** by that
fact]{.underline}. At the same time, [Americans eagerly want Europeans
to do more but **can't really sanction them** in any **painful
way**]{.underline} because, in the end, Europe is too strategically
important for the United States to abandon it and leave its defense to
the Europeans alone. Meanwhile, [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [feels the need to demonstrate]{.underline} to
both Europeans and external powers that [it **stands by** its **security
[commitments]{.mark}**]{.underline} to Europe and that it is ready to
show strength when needed. [This [could]{.mark}]{.underline} well
[**[undermine]{.mark}** the **strong American [push]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} Europeans to adopt the [2 percent]{.mark} metric. [It could
make the target less realistic by creating]{.mark} a **[false]{.mark}
sense of [security]{.mark}**]{.underline} among Europeans [[that serves
as an **incentive against**]{.underline}]{.mark}, not for, more
**[European [defense spending]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the absence of
any political will from the Europeans to significantly beef up their
defense, this impasse can basically only be broken in one of two ways:
Either the United States is completely honest about its role in Europe
and says it will continue to subsidize the continent's security. This
will probably mean an expensive, permanent recommitment to Europe over
the next decade or so. Or the United States reduces its commitment,
thereby risking a security crisis in Europe and the erosion of the
cornerstones of its global posture. [Neither of these two radical
solutions will be embraced]{.underline}, of course. Instead, [a third
option will likely **continue** for some time: [balancing]{.mark} the
two and hoping that a blend of demonstrated American [**solidarity**,
**lecturing**, and **threats**]{.mark} of leaving will move the
Europeans in the desired direction]{.underline}. This will be a shaky
compromise. It can only last as long as NATO and the territory protected
by Article 5 of the NATO treaty are not really threatened by anyone, and
as long as the political consensus in Washington survives that says
Europe, America's geostrategic countercoast, must be always defended by
the United States. Should the strategic situation in Europe change
dramatically, or should America's support for Europe erode, as some say
it inevitably will, [the status quo [will become]{.mark}
**[unsustainable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. No one knows how long it will
take to reach that point.

#### Loss is [more persuasive than gain]{.underline} for states [and]{.underline} sub-state actors

**[Berejikian & Early 13]{.underline}**, \*PhD, Professor at the
University of Georgia, Associate Professor in the Department of
International Affairs \*\*PhD, Associate Professor of Political Science,
Associate Dean for Research at the University at Albany, SUNY\'s
Rockefeller College (Jeffrey Berejikian; Bryan Early, 2013, "Loss
Aversion and Foreign Policy Resolve," *Political Psychology*, 34.5)

[Loss aversion is]{.underline} perhaps [the most enduring and intuitive
finding in behavioral decision theory]{.underline} (Kahneman et al.,
1991; Novemsky & Kahneman, 2005; Thaler, 1980). [Experimental results
suggest]{.underline} that the subjective [[**pain of loss** is
**greater** than]{.mark} the [benefit]{.mark} enjoyed [from]{.mark} an
equivalent [gain]{.mark}, and scholars have extended this finding beyond
the laboratory to explain a wide range of otherwise
puzzling]{.underline} human [behavior. Building upon these
results]{.underline}, and adding new findings from the field of
neuroscience, [we]{.underline} seek to [contribute to the
theory]{.underline}-building enterprise [in]{.underline} the study of
[foreign policy]{.underline} by constructing a gener- alizable theory of
loss aversion and foreign policy behavior. The approach is consistent
with the call to continue to develop theories of foreign policy built
upon solid micro foundations (Hudson, 2005). Specifically, we hope to
explain why policy makers stubbornly stand firm in their prosecution of
some international disputes while in others they are willing to back
down. [[The question is relevant for]{.mark} any number of foreign
policy issues, such as]{.underline} territorial disputes, trade
negotiations, conflicts over water rights, arms control, and
**[international treaty [compliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Much of the
research on loss aversion in the foreign policy literature has relied
heavily upon case studies (Mercer, 2005). However, for some time
scholars have suggested that loss aversion should produce broad patterns
of behavior that could, in principle, be captured by statistical
analysis (e.g., Jervis, 1992, Levy, 1996). [Large-n analyses of broader
behavior patterns]{.underline} thus remain fertile territory for
research and contain the potential for [advanc]{.underline}ing [our
understanding of how loss aversion affects foreign policy]{.underline}.
As we demonstrate in this article, foreign policy behaviors, like trade
disputes, can be analyzed using contemporary insights about loss
aversion derived from neuroscience. Our analysis proceeds in the
following manner. First, we build upon neuroscience research to argue
that policy makers\' aversion to accepting losses can affect their
willingness to back down in international disputes. [[Cognitive
science]{.mark} has [convincingly demonstrated]{.mark} that
[individuals]{.mark} tend to **[strive harder]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
take more risks [**[to avoid losses]{.mark}** than they will to achieve
similar gains]{.underline}. More recent [neuroscientific findings show
that [unrealized expectations]{.mark}, like]{.underline} those observed
[[**in a broken agreement**, are processed]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
human mind [in a way almost [identical to]{.mark} actual
[losses]{.mark}]{.underline}. The result is that unmet expectations can
also trigger loss aversion. Policy makers\' resolve during disputes can
thus vary if they perceive themselves to be defending previously
established agreements from violations by their counterparts. Such
violations diminish expected and hoped for gains, triggering loss
aversion. Generalizing from this phenomenon, we then distinguish between
preventive goals in which policy makers seek to protect against
perceived losses versus promotive goals in which policy makers seek to
make new gains. We theorize that policy makers should be less willing to
back down in disputes initiated for preventive reasons than for
promotive ones. We employ our theory to help explain cross-case
variation in the level of resolve demonstrated by the U.S. Trade
Representative (USTR) in prosecuting Section 301 trade disputes designed
to improve the terms of trade for U.S. businesses. Drawing on our
preventive versus promotive framework, we hypothesize that the USTR
should be less willing to back down in Section 301 disputes initiated
because of breached trade agreements than those initiated to open up new
markets. We test our theory via [two]{.underline} different [large-n
analyses]{.underline} of a hundred Section 301 trade disputes. This
approach is unique because - to the best of our knowledge - this study
constitutes the first theoretically driven statistical analysis of loss
aversion on foreign policy behavior grounded in a specific set of
neuroscientific findings. In our first test, we conduct an analysis
using binary logit, and, in the second, we employ a competing risks
model. The two approaches allow us to model the effects of time on U.S.
resolve in different ways. Our empirical results provide strong support
for our theory, revealing that the U.S. Government was significantly
less likely to back down in preventive disputes. Indeed, we find that
the preventive/promotive distinction provides the single greatest
determinant of U.S. resolve in prosecuting its Section 301 cases. We
believe that this project offers a number of novel contributions. First,
this study [demonstrate]{.underline}s [that [specific findings]{.mark}
from cognitive neuroscience can [make tangible contributions
to]{.mark}]{.underline} explaining phenomena in
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nternational
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**elations. Our study reveals that [loss
aversion]{.underline} and unrealized expecta- tions [profoundly shape
the behavior of even the most powerful states in the international
system]{.underline} and that it does so in ways that traditional
theoretical approaches are often blind to. This suggests that [the
loss-aversion-based framework]{.underline} we have developed
[may]{.underline} be able to [yield novel insights]{.underline} into a
host of other issue areas beyond the study of trade policy. Second, we
test our arguments utilizing [large-n]{.underline} statistical
analysis - a method that has seen little use in evaluating cognitive
and/or neuroscience theories of international relations (e.g., Drury,
2005). Moving forward with a program of [quantitative analysis broadens
the applicability of such theories]{.underline} and places them on equal
analytical footing with rationalist models. [Our project thus
demonstrates that the empirical barriers that have to date \"arrested\"
the development of the cognitive research agenda in international
relations can be overcome]{.underline} (Walker, 2007). Lastly, our
inquiry provides a number of case-specific insights explaining the
comparative resolve demonstrated by the United States in prosecuting its
Section 301 trade disputes and the policy implications that arise from
them.

Security Assistance as Incentive [Security assistance generates a
classic principal-agent problem.]{.underline} In such relationships
between a principal and its agent or proxy, [there exists an information
asymmetry where the agent inherently has more information about their
own capabilities, activities, and interests than the
principal]{.underline}. [Agents, being rational actors, place their own
interests above those of the principal and, in the absence of other
incentives, behave accordingly. The greater the degree of misalignment,
the more problematic this becomes]{.underline}. U.S. frustration during
its 20-year war in Afghanistan over Pakistan's perceived failure to
adequately confront extremist groups, despite significant military aid,
is an example of principal-agent problems at work. Fortunately, these
are not insurmountable obstacles. Security assistance in the form of
arms, equipment, or other support can be an effective incentive when it
is used as a carrot to reward desired behavior, such as achieving a
specific reform or taking some other action aligned with the interests
of the principal. Alternately, such aid becomes a stick when it is
withheld. An example of this carrot-and-stick approach being used
effectively is described in Walter Ladwig's study of U.S. assistance to
the Philippines to combat the Hukbalahap rebellion in the decade
following World War II. Heavy-handed tactics used by the local
constabulary forces were a major factor driving support for the rebels.
Recognizing this problem, U.S. advisors insisted on a series of reforms
within the security forces as a precondition for further aid. These
measures, along with the appointment of the reform-minded Ramon
Magsaysay as defense chief, contributed to a far more effective
counterinsurgency campaign and the eventual defeat of the rebel
movement. This approach of using aid as an incentive stands in sharp
contrast to Ladwig's other case study, Vietnam, where U.S. aid was used
as an inducement in the hope that it would eventually change partner
behavior. In this case, U.S. advisors tried in vain year after year to
cajole prime minister Ngo Dinh Diem and successor regimes to implement
reforms that would have broadened domestic political support and made
the South Vietnamese forces more effective. All the while, massive U.S.
assistance continued to flow in with the expectation that it would
eventually bring about a change of heart in the host-nation government.
Such change never came, and the United States and its South Vietnamese
proxies lost the war. The more recent U.S. experience in Iraq from 2003
until the withdrawal in 2011 contains echoes of Vietnam. David Lake's
study of that conflict suggests that provision of unconditional security
assistance may still be America's default setting. Despite massive
volumes of military aid provided to the Iraqi government during this
period, U.S. urging to reform the security forces and national
government repeatedly failed. Nouri al-Maliki, prime minister during
much of this period, resisted efforts to make the armed forces more
broadly inclusive and apolitical, instead continuing to employ them as
his own sectarian instrument. Again, the United States used an approach
focused on training and equipping, known in the current lexicon as
building partner capacity. The Iraqi government received assistance
regardless of its effort, or lack thereof, to implement much-needed
reform while the United States failed to use the leverage which hundreds
of millions of dollars of assistance could buy. Several years later, the
Iraqi military in which the United States had invested so much fell
apart virtually upon first contact with the Islamic State's irregular
militia. [The "building partner capacity" approach has two main flaws.
First, it ignores fundamental problems, such as corruption,
coup-proofing, and otherwise weak defense institutions which additional
military capacity cannot overcome and may even exacerbate]{.underline}.
Paradoxically, [a focus primarily on capacity-building often fails to
build meaningful, long-term capacity because it neglects underlying
institutional problems.]{.underline} Second, [it ignores principal-agent
problems by assuming that once in possession of highly capable security
forces, the partner will wield them in a manner aligned with U.S.
interests]{.underline}. [U.S. advisors and diplomats may recognize the
pressing need for security sector reform in the partner. Unfortunately,
the ingrained culture of U.S. security assistance seemingly relies on
the false premise that with enough U.S. training and
relationship-building, other countries' militaries will voluntarily
reform even though it is often not in their personal interests to do
so]{.underline}.
