### Psycho fails

#### Policy is just driven by desire -- it acts as a temporary fix

The third stage of development is the 'Oedipus complex': the encounter
with sexual difference. Successful completion of the Oedipus complex
enforces our transition from the Imaginary to the Symbolic. It also
compounds our sense of 'lack'. [The impossibility of fulfillment is now
experienced as a movement from signifier to signifier, unable to fix
upon a signified.]{.underline} For Lacan (1989), desire is the hopeless
pursuit of the fixed signified (the 'other', the 'Real', the moment of
plenitude, the mother's body), always forever becoming another signifier
-- the 'incessant sliding of the signified under the signifier'. [Desire
exists in the impossibility of closing the gap between self and other--
to make good that which we 'lack'.]{.underline} We long for a time when
we existed in 'nature' (inseparable from the mother's body), where
everything was simply itself, before the mediations of language and the
Symbolic. As we move forward through the narrative of our lives, we are
driven by a desire to overcome the condition, and as we look back, we
continue to 'believe' (this is mostly an unconscious process) that the
union with the mother (or the person playing the symbolic role of the
mother) was a moment of plenitude before the fall into 'lack'. The
'lesson' of the 'Oedipus complex' is that the child must now resign
itself to the fact that it can never have any direct access to the
prohibited body of the mother. [After the Oedipus crisis, we will never
again be able to attain this precious object, even though we will spend
all our lives hunting for it. We have to make do instead with substitute
objects with which we try vainly to plug the gap at the very center of
our being. We move among substitutes for substitutes, metaphors for
metaphors, never able to recover the pure (if fictive) self-identity and
self-completion.]{.underline}

In Lacanian theory, it is an original lost object -- the mother's body
[-- which drives forward the narrative of our lives, impelling us to
pursue substitutes for this lost paradise in the endless metonymic
movement of desire.]{.underline} The ideology of romantic love -- in
which 'love' is the ultimate solution to all our problems -- could be
cited as an example of this endless search. What I mean by this is the
way that romance as a discursive practice holds that love makes us
whole, it completes our being. Love in effect promises to return us to
the Real: that blissful moment of plenitude, inseparable from the body
of the mother. We can see this played out in the masculine romance of
Paris, Texas. The film can be read as a road movie of the unconscious, a
figuration of Travis Henderson's impossible struggle to return to the
moment of plenitude. The film stages three attempts at return: first,
Travis goes to Mexico in search of his mother's origins; then he goes to
Paris (Texas) [in search of the moment when he was conceived in his
mother's body; finally, in an act of 'displacement',]{.underline} he
returns Hunter to Jane (a son to his mother), [in symbolic recognition
that his own quest is doomed to failure.]{.underline}

#### Psycho has no scientific backing and is highly criticized

immunology and molecular biology. "Psychoanalysis, Science or
Pseudoscience?" OpenMind BBVA. May 6, 2019.

As much as the couch is a piece of furniture associated with television,
the "divan" or Turkish couch is a piece of furniture associated with
psychoanalysis. Starting at the end of the 19th century, the
Austrian [Sigmund
Freud](https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/science/leading-figures/freud-a-pessimist-that-trusted-science/) abandoned
neurological research to develop his psychotherapy, the method that
acquired such notoriety that it became an ingredient of Western popular
culture, elevating its originator to the position of the most
famous psychiatrist ---something he never was--- of all time. [But his
status is wrapped up in a perennial polemic: Is there any scientific
evidence to support psychoanalysis? Or is it merely a pseudoscience,
perhaps among the most academic of them all?]{.underline}

In 1885, Freud (6 May 1856 -- 23 September 1939) traveled to Paris to
study the use of hypnosis in the treatment of psychopathology by the
neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot. On his return to Vienna the following
year, he began to apply this technique to the treatment of his patients,
but soon dispensed with it to limit himself to an extensive dialogue
that brought out the subject's experiences and memories. Of particular
importance were dreams, which for Freud were a door to the
unconscious and the repressed memories from childhood, usually of a
sexual content. Oedipus complex, castration and penis envy became
theoretical pillars of his method, which a decade later was already
being applied under the name of psychoanalysis.

Freud's approach was considered innovative at the time, and has
evidently permeated the later evolution of psychopathology. [However,
right from its inception it was the subject of criticism by renowned
figures such as the neuroscientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal. Starting in
1919, the philosopher of science Karl Popper, hitherto an enthusiast of
psychoanalysis, began to object that psychoanalysts were always able to
explain the symptoms of their patients a posteriori through their
theories, but did not come up with predictions subject to experimental
verification, something that purely scientific ideas did, such as
Einstein's relativity.]{.underline}

SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY IN QUESTION

[This impossibility of falsification led Popper to define psychoanalysis
as a pseudoscience, comparable to astrology. Over the years, the
scientific validity of this discipline has been challenged by prominent
figures such as psychologist Steven Pinker, linguist Noam Chomsky,
evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould and physicist Richard Feynman.
Among the critics who have dissected the shortcomings of psychoanalysis
are the philosophers [Adolf
Grünbaum](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20482837?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) and [Frank
Cioffi](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-009-5093-1_2) and
psychologist [Malcolm
Macmillan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freud_Evaluated), among
others.]{.underline}

[One of the most fervent and cited detractors of psychoanalysis is
Frederick C. Crews, Professor Emeritus of English at the University of
California, Berkeley. His recent work [Freud: The Making of an
Illusion](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781627797177) (Metropolitan
Books, 2017) has been described as "the book that definitively puts an
end to the myth of psychoanalysis and its creator.]{.underline}" For
Crews, the main argument that Popper began to gestate a century ago and
that he [developed in his book Conjectures and
Refutations](https://nemenmanlab.org/~ilya/images/0/07/Popper-1953.pdf) (1963)
still stands today: the propositions of any scientific theory must be
refuted by evidence to the contrary, but those of psychoanalysis are
not. "[No evidence can refute them, because they entail no testable
consequences," Crews summarizes for OpenMind. "As a result, there can be
no orderly refinement of psychoanalysis as a science," he
adds.]{.underline}

This has not prevented some defenders of psychoanalysis from seeking to
build bridges between Freud's method and science. On the one hand,
neuropsychologists such as Mark Solms (who did not respond to questions
from OpenMind) [attempt to find the traces of psychoanalysis in the
brain through neuroimaging
techniques](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22153583/). But as Joel
Paris, [a psychiatrist at McGill University (Canada),
wrote](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5459228/), ["the
observed correspondences are superficial and hardly support the complex
edifice of psychoanalytic theory." "Psychoanalysis is not a therapy with
an evidence base and should be stopped," Paris
tells OpenMind.]{.underline}

On the other hand, studies and meta-analyses ---studies that gather and
summarise the evidence from several other studies--- have been
undertaken to assess the possible benefits of the technique in the
treatment of various disorders. [And although some of these
investigations have found positive results, [the methodology of these
studies has been
criticised ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23660968/)for lacking
the rigour and control of randomised clinical trials.]{.underline}

[For Crews, there is another, even more radical criticism of these
studies, which is that they are contaminated by the bias of their
authors, who "inevitably begin from a psychoanalytic point of view and
are determined to salvage it at all cost." "How likely is it that we
will ever see the reverse: a well-trained, non-Freudian scientific
researcher who finds himself compelled by the evidence to reinterpret
all his data in psychoanalytic terms?" he asks. "It can't happen,
because to be well trained in science is already to discount a shapeless
mass of self-contradictory theory that never had straightforward
empirical content in the first place."]{.underline}

A CLOSED AND DOGMATIC TREND

But the truth is that this search for bridges between psychoanalysis and
science does not seem to be something that interests the entire
psychoanalytic community. Journalist and neuroscientist Casey Schwartz,
who in his book [In the Mind Fields: Exploring the New Science of
Neuropsychoanalysis](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/234817/in-the-mind-fields-by-casey-schwartz/9780804169943/) (Pantheon,
2015) reviewed the attempts to combine neuroscience and psychoanalysis,
explains to OpenMind: "When I was reporting my book, many analysts I met
were hugely enthusiastic and excited about neuroscience, others
cautiously curious, others disinterested." According to Paris, many
traditional psychoanalysts "do not want to dilute Freud's wine with
neuroscientific water."

[In fact, one of the main criticisms of psychoanalysis has been,
according to some authors, the closed and excessively dogmatic nature of
this trend, which from the beginning provoked clashes between Freud and
some of his closest collaborators, such as [Otto
Rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Rank) or [Eugen
Bleuler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugen_Bleuler); the latter
compared the movement to a religious community. "The slander of critics
and rivals, a bad habit that was liberally indulged by Freud himself,
becomes, necessarily, the routine substitute for empirical dialogue,"
says Crews.]{.underline}

As part of this flight from the scientific field, psychoanalysis has
sought refuge in the humanities, a field in which it is not obliged to
respond to empirical demands. As psychoanalyst Siegfried Zepf from the
University of Saarland (Germany) points out to OpenMind, "psychoanalysis
is not a natural science, but a hermeneutic science." In other words, it
interprets phenomena, but does not test hypotheses empirically.

However, many experts believe that this departure from science is not
acceptable for a discipline that today aspires to compete with
scientifically validated treatments such as cognitive-behavioral
therapy, which according to Paris is currently the most influential
psychotherapy, and which inherits from psychoanalysis its format
dialogue, but dispenses with Freudian theories. In the world of the
twenty-first century, concludes Paris, [psychoanalysis "may only survive
if it is prepared to dismantle its structure as a separate discipline
and rejoin academia and clinical science."]{.underline}
