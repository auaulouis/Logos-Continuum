### 2AC -- AT: Capitalism K 

#### WRONG -- It's no longer just capitalism! It's something worse!

**Wark 19** \[Mckenzie Wark, 2019, "Capitalism is Dead: Is this
something worse?", \<\<Professor of Media & Cultural Studies @ The New
School\>\>, Verso\][\\\\pairie](file:///\\pairie)

A reminder of the thought experiment that threads through these
chapters: [What if this was **no longer capitalism, but something
worse?** Could we approach this now by describing relations of
exploitation and domination in the present, starting with the emerging
features, and work back and out and up from that?]{.underline} This
chapter plays mostly with the sociological imagination. 1 This is the
ability to conceptualize the problem synchronically, as if we could
slice through the social formation of the present and look at its
anatomy, rather than diachronically, in terms of patterns of development
through time (a topic discussed in Chapter 5, a historical fantasia).

Since the sociology we are playing with is vulgar Marxist, our
imagination might be drawn initially to some features of the forces of
production. [It is still the case that extracting useful organic and
inorganic matter from the earth is the basis of social existence. And it
is still the case that applying vast amounts of energy in the form of
fossil fuels and labor]{.underline} to that base matter [is still how
the endless array of commodities around us come into existence. But both
of those processes seem these days to be **subordinated** to a third
form of relation]{.underline}. [At the smallest and largest scales, so
much of primary production and secondary manufacturing seems to be
controlled by rapid flows, extensive archives and complex algorithms
whose concrete existence is]{.underline} in a tertiary form---[that of
information.]{.underline}

[The forces of production that instrumentalize information extend all
the way into the production process, whether in the form of industrial
robotics or the detailed and **constant surveillance of living
labor.**]{.underline} They extend all the way out to global networks of
measurement, command, and control that work in real time. These networks
of information subsume not only inorganic and organic matter and energy
in their web but also the human as "user," who becomes a producer of
information even when not working. The value of information can be
extracted even from free labor. The relations of production seem to
evolve to enclose these forces in rather novel extensions of the private
property form. Wittgenstein's contribution to communism was his robust
proof of the proposition that there is no private language, but in our
time, **[privatized languages are everywhere.]{.underline}** 2 [And not
just languages: **Images, codes, algorithms, even genes can become
private property**, and in turn private property shapes what we imagine
the limits and possibilities of this information to be.]{.underline}

Information is a relation between novelty and repetition, noise and
order. 3 Novelty is extracted from a class whose efforts are hardly
described by the category of labor, for the simple reason that while
labor repeats an action whose form is given in advance, the whole point
of these actions is to produce unique instances of such forms in the
first place. Alongside the worker is the figure of the hacker, producer
not of repeated content but of novel form, and form which more often
than not ends up being someone else's property.

[One has to ask whether the ruling class presiding over this mode of
production is still adequately described as capitalist.]{.underline} 4
[It seems **no longer necessary to directly own** the means of
production. A remarkable amount of the valuation of the leading
companies of our time consists not of tangible assets, but **rather of
information.**]{.underline} A company is its brands, its patents, its
trademarks, its reputation, its logistics, and perhaps above all its
distinctive practices of evaluating information itself.

Some like to talk as if one could just add an adjective or two to
capitalism and describe all this, but we have already rejected that
option as uninteresting poetry. [Maybe it's **not the same old
familiar** endless essence of capitalism cloaked in new
appearances.]{.underline} [For instance, call it finance capitalism if
you like, but perhaps the rise of finance is really just a
symptom]{.underline}. Yann Moulier Boutang invites us to see finance as
something other than speculative or fictive excess. 5 It has to do with
the whole problemof exchange value in an age where the forces of
production are extensively and intensively controlled by information:
**[nobody knows what anything is worth]{.underline}**. [Financialization
is a perverse socializing of the problem of the uncertainty of
information about value.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- AT: Settler Colonialism K 

#### Perm do both -- it definitely solves -- indigenous movements like Idle No More focus on rejecting the will to technology

Technologies of abandonment: lost dreams of the sustainable "global
village" [Insurgencies of the periphery: Idle No More, a courageous
Indigenous political protest of global significance, takes place in the
bitter cold of a Canadian winter.1]{.underline} Inspired by a hunger
strike by an Indigenous woman, Chief Theresa Spence, an Attawapiskat
tribal leader, from a community on the shores of James Bay, Idle No More
is resistance by the abandoned. [Not quiet resistance, but Indigenous
collectivities in solidarity, spontaneously organizing as dancing flash
mobs moving to the inspiring rhythms of Indigenous drummers in shopping
malls, outdoor city squares, blockading busy highways and barricading
railway track]{.underline}s. Day after day, the hunger strike by Chief
Spence continues with one simple, but basic, demand: to meet with the
Canadian government to negotiate nation-to-nation exploitative land-use
policies affecting all the energy sectors that are quickly destroying
the land and its Indigenous inhabitants. The government's official
response is the silence of cynical indifference, perhaps based on the
political calculation that defeating Indigenous protest will facilitate
exploitation of the land. In this case, the themes rise beyond simple
politics to the level of Thinking the Future 185 eschatology. As long as
Indigenous responsibility for the land and its inhabitants exists, the
earth will continue to exist. Disappear Indigenous protest, and the land
and its (dissenting) inhabitants may well disappear as well. When
McLuhan once said that, in the electronic world, any periphery can
quickly become the center of politics, he probably didn't have in mind a
hunger strike undertaken by a single Indigenous woman in a teepee on a
small island [on the Ottawa River across from the parliament buildings
of Canada. Truly one of those insurgencies of the periphery in which
great eschatological themes -- the future of the land, the very survival
of Indigenous peoples, the possible reconciliation of humans with earth,
sky, water, and air -- achieve such powerful clarity that suddenly the
center of politics,]{.underline} Canadian at first, but swiftly by
extension any form of politics steered by massive energy projects,
gravitates around the profound ethical issues raised by an Indigenous
tribal leader who says "no."

With Idle No More, we are present at the first of the clashes of
cosmology that will increasingly dominate the politics and culture of
the twenty-first century -- a cosmological collision between the system
of politics, economy, and information associated with the ruling will to
technology and the more profound vision of sustainability emerging from
this insurgency of the periphery[. If official power can respond only
with the silence of indifference, perhaps that is because the masters of
the technological universe -- political and energy elites -- recognize
that no mediation is possible in this clash of cosmology]{.underline},
that in the courageous body politics of an Indigenous tribal leader
willing to wager her claims to a broader sense of justice on the scales
of life and death, that everything is at stake, that there can be no
easy reconciliation between these competing life visions because what is
really involved here is less a local political protest than a
fundamental turning point in the direction of cosmology -- technologies
of abandonment represented in all their destructive intensity by mass
energy projects versus enduring dreams of earth, land, and people
mediated by social community and personal responsibility as a common
dwelling place. Seemingly everything, today, is environment to the will
to technology, not only the natural environment but human nature as well
with all that entails for the future of human subjectivity.
Transcendental in spirit and driven by a double dialectic of
augmentation and incorporation, the will to technology has evolved to a
point well in excess of what Nietzsche described as the "will to power"
and Heidegger the "will to will." Perhaps sensing the appearance of an
epochal change, that moment when the will to technology began to turn
back on itself, the philosopher Hannah Arendt captured the essence of
contemporary 186 Crash times when she noted in her last book, Life of
the Mind, that the future will be fully enveloped by the metaphysics of
the "not-will" -- a time of abandonment of all that is not necessary for
the self-preservation of the will to technology. In Arendt's prophetic
vision, the historical primacy of conditions for the self-preservation
of technique will inevitably result in the nihilism of "not-being," that
moment in which everything that is valued is measured only in its
relationship to the self-preservation of the will to technology and,
subsequently, everything that is not a condition of self-preservation is
abandoned, effectively left behind as surplus remainder. [**Idle No
More**, this insurgency of the periphery, this declaration on behalf of
a deeper conception of a sustainable environment that speaks to issues
of individuals, community, and nature, is a **rebellion against this
formulation of the will to technology.**]{.underline}

#### This is [offense]{.underline} -- it means the alternative's knowledge production is wedded to [technical development narratives]{.underline}.

[The centrality of knowledge in the global economy and in
**imperialistic politics of development** is made more evident when we
examine the subject of the environment.]{.underline} Beginning with the
Conference in Rio already mentioned, the environment becomes the
backbone of sustainable development. It was at the conference where this
Conference that The Agreement on Biological Diversity was signed,
obligating signatory nations to protect their genetic resources given
that now genetic resources were considered part of the 'common heritage
of mankind'. [The United Nations' interest in the conservation and
management if this 'heritage' is clear: genetic resources have
**economic value** and mean benefits for those businesses that work with
the latest technologies in the areas of biotechnology and genetic
engineering. In this way, the handling of information and abstract
languages what H/N call 'immaterial production' is placed at the center
of the capitalist, postmodern business.]{.underline}

In effect, the identification, alteration and transference of genetic
material by way of knowledge have economic applications in the fields of
agriculture and health. In the agricultural sector, biotechnology works
by incrementing the production of food by means of the production of
transgenic plants that are most resistant to plagues and insects, and
less vulnerable to chemical fumigation. In 1999, 90 percent of the soya
beans produced in Argentina and 33 percent of the corn produced in the
United States originate from transgenic crops, and that percentage is
even higher for products like cotton, tomatoes, tobacco, sugar cane,
asparagus, strawberries, papaya, kiwi, barley, cucumber and zucchini.
The biotechnological transformation of agriculture is a profitable
business for the food industry and is controlled by a handful of
businesses specialized in biotechnical research. The same occurs in the
health sector. The pharmaceutical industry is concentrated in the
production of medicines with a biological basis that are used in the
treatment of illnesses like cancer, hemophilia, and hepatitis B, not to
mention the growing production of generic medication and pharmaceutical
drugs. It is estimated that the market for medication derived from pant
extracts or biological products generates profits that hover around four
hundred thousand million dollars annually, earnings that are
concentrated in the hands of a small number of multinational businesses
that monopolize ground-breaking research.14

Therefore, the subject of biodiversity places us at the forefront of a
strategic sector of the global economy that will certainly redefine the
geopolitics of the twenty-first century because access to genetic
information will determine the difference between success and economic
failure. Multinational corporations are interested in genetic resources
that can be altered and manipulated by expert knowledge. Interestingly
enough the greatest diversity is found in countries located in the
South, the underdeveloped countries. For this reason, these businesses
have initiated a real 'lobbying' campaign to obtain patents for these
resources, appealing to intellectual property rights (CDI). Before the
Uruguayan round of the GATT15 in 1993, no transnational legislation
existed that pertained to intellectual property rights. Multinational
businesses like Bristol Myers, DuPont, Johnson & Johnson, Merck and
Pfizer, with vested interests in the biodiversity business, pressured
for the introduction of the TRIP16 accord into the negotiations. This
agreement permits the monopolistic control of the planet's genetic
resources by businesses.

Intellectual Property is a juridical concept with a transnational scope.
It is protected by the United Nations through the OMPI (World
Intellectual Property Organization), which protects and regulates the
'creations and innovations of the human intellect', such as artistic and
scientific works.17 According to this norm, when immaterial products
involve some type of technological innovation that has commercial
application, they can be patented by their authors and used as if they
were private property.18 A patent is defined as the concession that the
State grants to an inventor so he can commercially exploit his product
in an exclusive way, for a certain amount of time. In the case of
biodiversity and genetic resources, multinational corporations that work
with the latest technologies can legitimately claim that any genetic
alteration of the flora and fauna implies an inventive activity of the
intellect that has a direct application in the agricultural or
pharmaceutical industries, and therefore they are rightfully protected
by patents. By claiming that genetically modified biological material is
no longer a product of nature but of human intellect, the multinationals
claim the right to patent and declare as their own the economic benefits
from the commercialization of these products. Legitimated in this way by
a supranational juridical regime, the intellectual assets administered
by multinational corporations are converted into the key sector for the
creation of wealth in postmodern capitalism.

But it is precisely here where the 'postcolonial face' of Empire is
revealed. [I am talking about the ways in which new representations of
development reinforce the modern/colonial hierarchies in a postmodern
register, establishing a difference between the valid knowledge of some,
and the non-knowledge or doxa of the others.]{.underline} One example of
this is the way in which global agendas of sustainable development
approach the subject of 'traditional knowledge'. Multinational
corporations are aware that by association with biodiversity and genetic
resources, traditional knowledge and its 'officials' acquire a fabulous
economic potential and represent numerous opportunities for
commercialization. [It is no wonder that in 2001 the OMPI created a
'intergovernmental committee for the protection of intellectual
property, genetic resources, traditional knowledge and folklore', and
that in 2003 UNESCO declared that ' \... communities,]{.underline} in
particular [indigenous communities, play an important role in the
production, safeguarding, maintenance and recreation of the intangible
cultural heritage, thus helping to enrich cultural diversity and human
creativity'.19 The '**safeguarding' of traditional knowledge**, now
transformed into the '**guarantors of sustainable development', does not
come for free.**]{.underline} What is sought is to put a whole series of
knowledges used for hundreds of years, by hundreds of communities
world-wide at the disposal of multinationals specialized in research on
genetic resources. [These knowledges become **susceptible to
appropriation** by multinational corporations through
patents.]{.underline} Naturally, this requires a change in the
representations of the other. What does this change consist of?

We know that in the modern paradigm of development, non-occidental
systems were seen as the enemies of progress. It was assumed that
industrialization created the conditions to leave behind a type of
knowledge based in myths and superstitions, replacing it with the
technical-scientific knowledge of modernity. It was also believed that
personal traits like passivity, lack of discipline and indolence,
associated perhaps to defects of race, depended rather on the 'absence
of modernity'. The absence of modernity could be overcome in the same
way that the State resolves structural problems like illiteracy and
poverty. In this way, the modern paradigm of development was also a
colonial paradigm. 'Other' knowledges had to be disciplined or excluded.

[However, and as H/N see it**, postmodern capitalism** is presented as a
**machine of segmentary inclusions**, not of exclusions. Non-occidental
knowledge is welcomed by the global agendas of Empire because it is
useful to the capitalist project of biodiversity.]{.underline} [The
tolerance of cultural diversity has become a 'politically correct' value
in Empire, but only in the sense that diversity is useful for the
**reproduction of capital**. The indigenous person, for example, is no
longer seen as someone pertaining to the social, economic and cognitive
past of humanity, but as the 'guardian of biodiversity']{.underline}
(Ulloa, 2004). Once considered obstacles to a nation's economic
development, [the indigenous are now seen as indispensable to the
sustainable development of the world.]{.underline} Traditional knowledge
is elevated to the category of 'the intangible heritage of humanity'.
Arturo Escobar formulates it in this way:

### 2AC -- AT: Feminist Cyborg K

#### Perm do both -- the post/transhumanist reading of her work is [wrong]{.underline} and gets coopted by the same cybernetic systems we are describing -- Haraway agrees!

**Haraway & Gane 06** \[Dona Haraway & Nicholas Gane, 12-01-2006, "When
We have Never Been Human, What Is to Be Done?: Interview with Donna
Haraway,", \<\<Donna is a Professor in the History of Consciousness

NG: [One thing I find fascinating about the 'Manifesto' is its complex
mix of feminism and cybernetics. It is stated, for example, that 'Human
beings, like any other component or subsystem, must be localized in a
system architecture whose basic modes of operation are
probabilistic']{.underline} (Haraway, 1991a: 212). This is a radical
extension of Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver's famous Mathematical
Theory of Communication (1949), in which information is defined in
statistical terms. In an interview conducted in 1999 you said that you
were familiar with the work of Norbert Wiener at the point of writing
the 'Manifesto' (Haraway, 2004: 324), but were Shannon and Weaver also
key points of reference? And what of cybernetics more generally -- is
this a field which continues to influence your work? DH: Yes, Shannon
and Weaver were there. I had read them and the Macy conferences were
there more generally. My dissertation adviser was Evelyn Hutchinson
(1903--91), who was a really wonderful man: a theoretical ecologist,
mathematician, biologist, natural historian, studier of Italian medieval
manuscripts -- a polymath of his generation, English by origin (see
Hutchinson, 1979). I fled to his lab from developmental biology and its
molecular incarnations because all my cells were dying in the lab --
partly! But mainly because I was intellectually unhappy and I finally
had to get it that biology for me was a cultural-material practice. I
needed to locate biology in its intersection with many other communities
of practice, made up of entangled humans and others, living and not.
Evelyn Hutchinson's lab made that possible. In his lab we read things
like Simone Weil, Shannon and Weaver, and Virginia Woolf -- those were
the 'biology' texts that we read as part of his lab group. It was not a
biology lab group in the narrow sense. It was a 'what's interesting the
world' lab group. And a lot of people that came out of Evelyn's lab --
like Robert MacArthur (1930--72) -- \[were\] really important
biologists. MacArthur's colleague-ship with E.O. Wilson on island
biogeography (MacArthur and Wilson, 2001 \[1967\]) is really important.
MacArthur was a major cybernetic theorist in animal behaviour and a
fabulous ornithologist. 138 Theory, Culture & Society 23(7--8)
Downloaded from tcs.sagepub.com at University of Waikato Library on June
8, 2014 Anyway, a lot of people came out of Evelyn's lab deeply
interested in various aspects of cybernetics, including me. But how
could you not be interested in that stuff in those years? The quote you
just read is not so much what I want to be the case but my sitting down
and looking at what seemed to me to be an imperative that knowledge
projects these days constitute their objects of attention in the
Foucauldian sense -- as discourse constitutes it own objects of
attention. This is not a relativist position. This is not about things
being merely constructed in a relative sense. This is about those
objects that we non-optionally are. Our systems are probabilistic
information entities. It is not that this is the only thing that we or
anyone else is. It is not an exhaustive description but it is a
non-optional constitution of objects, of knowledge in operation. It is
not about having an implant, it is not about liking it. [This is not
some kind of blissed-out technobunny joy in information.]{.underline} It
is a statement that we had better get it -- this is a worlding
operation. Never the only worlding operation going on, but one that we
had better inhabit as more than a victim. [We had better get it that
domination is not the only thing going on here. We had better get it
that this is a zone where we had better be the movers and the shakers,
or we will be just victims.]{.underline} So inhabiting the cyborg is
what this manifesto is about. [The cyborg is a figuration but it is also
an obligatory worlding -- that inhabiting it you can't not get it --
that it's a military project, a **late capitalist project** in deep
collaboration with **new forms of imperial war**]{.underline} --
McNamara's electronic battlefield is of course a major parent of cyborg
worlds -- also the Bell telephone company. And much more than that --
cyborgs open radical possibilities at the same time. This is like Bruno
Latour, but I give more space to the critic in the basement than Bruno
Latour. I have more sympathy with critical theory than Bruno does --
much more. And I'm much more willing to live with indigestible
intellectual and political heritages. I need to hold on to impossible
heritages more than I suspect Bruno wants to. Our kinds of creativity
take different directions but they're allied. So yes, Shannon and Weaver
are in there big time. Cybernetics is in there in various forms. Gregory
Bateson is in there too, and through Bateson's lineage the second/third
order of cybernetic worlds that Katherine Hayles analyses (see Hayles,
1999). I'm sympathetic to certain kinds of cybernetic efforts to think
through autopoiesis. Lynn Margulis is also in there with the whole Gaia
hypothesis of the world, including her symbiogenesis stuff. I am
nonetheless deeply resistant to systems theories of all kinds, including
so-called third-order cybernetics and the autopoiesis and structural
coupling approaches. I'm not really happy there, but I remember that
there is much more than Norbert Wiener in cybernetics. NG: There seems
to have been a general resurgence of interest in cybernetics as debates
over the 'posthuman' have come to the fore (for example in Hayles,
1999). The subtitle of your 1992 essay 'Ecce Homo, Ain't (Ar'n't) Gane &
Haraway -- Interview with Donna Haraway 139 Downloaded from
tcs.sagepub.com at University of Waikato Library on June 8, 2014 I a
Woman, and Inappropriate/d Others' is 'The Human in a Post-humanist
Landscape' (in Haraway, 2004: 47--61). [What do you take this term
'posthuman' to mean? Is it a concept that you continue to find
useful?]{.underline} DH: [I've stopped using it.]{.underline} I did use
it for a while, including in the 'Manifesto'. I think it's a bit
impossible not to use it sometimes, but I'm trying not to use it. Kate
Hayles writes this smart, wonderful book How We Became Posthuman. She
locates herself in that book at the right interface -- the place where
people meet IT apparatuses, where worlds get reconstructed as
information. I am in strong alliance with her insistence in that book,
namely getting at the materialities of information. Not letting anyone
think for a minute that this is immateriality rather than getting at its
specific materialities. That I'm with, that sense of 'how we became
posthumanist'. [Still, human/posthuman **is much too easily
appropriated** by the blissed-out, 'Let's all be posthumanists and find
our next teleological evolutionary stage in some kind of **transhumanist
technoenhancement**.' Posthumanism is too easily appropriated to those
kinds of projects for my taste. Lots of people doing posthumanist
thinking, though, don't do it that way]{.underline}. The reason I go to
companion species is to get away from posthumanism.

### 2AC -- AT: Antiblackness K 

#### Permutation do both -- theorize through [black data]{.underline}.

**McGlotten 14** \[Shaka McGlotten, 02-13-2014, "Black Data," Traversing
Technologies, \<\<Shaka is a social anthropologist & Professor of Media
Studies at the State University of New York\>\>,
[https://sfonline.barnard.edu/traversing-technologies/shaka-mcglotten-black-data/\]\\\\pairie](https://sfonline.barnard.edu/traversing-technologies/shaka-mcglotten-black-data/%5d\\pairie)

Thurston's work on race and technology provides a template for my talk
today. Here I engage in a Black queer call and response with a few key
areas in culture. I use an eclectic group of artifacts: Thurston's
slideshow, an interview with Barack Obama in the wake of the NSA
surveillance scandal, the artwork of Zach Blas, and a music video about
technology and gentrification. [I do this to proffer **the heuristic
Black data.** This heuristic, I suggest, offers some initial political
and analytical traction for Black queer studies to more fully engage
with the theories, effects, and affects of network
cultures.]{.underline} And although there are some significant bodies of
literature in science and technology studies, as well as cultural and
media studies, that grapple with issues of race, there are only a
handful of issues from Black queer studies itself that really address
sexuality and new media head on.

So here I use Black data to think through some of the historical and
contemporary ways that Black queer people, like other people of African
descent and people of color more broadly, are hailed by big data,
through which techniques of race and racism reduce our lives to mere
numbers. [We appear as commodities, revenue streams, statistical
deviations, or vectors of risk. Big data also refers to the efforts of
states and corporations to **capture, predict, and control** political
and consumer behavior]{.underline}. In my reading, then, Black data is
also a response to big data's call. And I'm going to offer some readings
that outline possible political and affective vectors---some ways to
refuse the call or perhaps even to hang up.

[Black queer lives are often **reduced** to forms of
accounting]{.underline} that are variously intended to elicit alarm or
to direct highly circumscribed forms of care. Statistics are typically
used to mobilize people, for example, in the fight against
HIV/AIDS---statistics like the fact that Blacks account for 44 percent
of new HIV infections in the United States. Statistics are also used to
direct attention to the omnipresence of violence in Black life or to the
specific forms of violence that are directed against Black LGBTQ people,
as in the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs 2012 report,
which describes how LGBTQ people of color were nearly twice as likely to
experience physical violence as their white counterparts and transgender
people of color were two and a half times more likely to experience
police violence than white cisgender survivors.

[**Assigning numerical or financial value to Black life**, transforming
experience into information or data, is nothing new. Rather, it is
caught up with the history of enslavement and the racist regimes that
sought to **justify its barbarities**]{.underline}. Between the
sixteenth and eighteenth centuries more than twelve and a half million
Africans were transported to the New World. Two million, and likely many
more, died during the Middle Passage alone. A typical slave ship could
carry more than 300 slaves, arranged like sardines, and the sick and the
dead would be thrown overboard, their loss claimed for insurance money.

Other more recent data circulates in the wake of the ongoing global
recession, or the protest against George Zimmerman's exoneration in the
killing of seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin. In this period, Black
families saw their wealth drop 31 percent. This is just between 2007 and
2010 in the United States. And in 2012, 136 unarmed Black men were
killed by police and security guards.

It is tempting, of course, to ascribe these racialized accountings to
the cruel systems of value that are established by capitalism, which
seeks to encode, to quantify, and to order life and matter into
categories of commodity, labor, exchange value, and profit. Indeed, race
itself functions as such a commodity in the era of genomic testing. A
simple oral swab test can help you to answer Thurston's question "How
Black are you?," and you can watch others' reactions on the popular
television show Faces of America, a show that's about genealogical
testing and people trying to find their racial or ethnic roots. But as
Lisa Nakamura, Peter Chow-White, and Wendy Chun observe, race is not
merely an effect of capitalism's objectifying systems. [Rather, race is
itself a co-constituting technology that made such forms of accounting
possible in the first place.]{.underline}

[Race as technology, Chun notes, helps us to understand how race
functions as the "as," how it facilitates comparisons between entities
that are classed as similar/dissimilar.]{.underline} As Mel Chen put it
in their recent book Animacies, race is an animate hierarchy in which
the liveliness and value of some things---say, whiteness, or smart
technology---are established via proximity to other things that are
positioned lower or further away---like Blackness, or dumb matter. This
poster's tweet, "Wow. Too many negroes in the trending topics for me,"
simply reiterates in the realm of microblogging hierarchical techniques
of racism that see Black people as polluting, and therefore as
distasteful or dangerous, or that would deny information and technology
to the subjects of discrimination.

Of course, all of the statistics that I have just gone through are
probably familiar, at least to some of us. And while useful, they tell
only very partial stories, and [they tend to **reduce Black life to a
mere effect of capitalism** or to a kind of numerology of bare
life.]{.underline} So in what follows, I'm going to sketch a few
different trajectories for what I'm calling Black data. [I'll enact
Black data as a kind of informatics of Black queer life, as reading and
throwing shade to grapple with the NSA surveillance scandal, new
biometric technologies, and the tech-fueled gentrification of San
Francisco.]{.underline} These readings, which are perhaps obviously also
actings out, also help to illustrate the ways that Black queer theories,
practices, and lives might be made to matter in relation to some of the
organizing tensions of contemporary network cultures, privacy,
surveillance, capture, and exclusion.

[Black queers help to frame what is at stake in these debates insofar as
we quite literally embody struggles between surveillance and capture,
between the seen and **unseen,** between the visible and
**invisible**.]{.underline} Moreover, queers of color and people of
color more broadly have developed what others have called rogue
epistemologies, which often themselves rely on an array of technological
media which might help to make us present or to disappear. In the
readings that follow, I also gesture towards the virtual infinities that
Black queer theoretical or political projects might share with
cryptographic and anarchistic activism.
