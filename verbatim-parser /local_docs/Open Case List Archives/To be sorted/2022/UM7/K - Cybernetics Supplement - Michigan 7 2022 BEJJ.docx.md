4\. What Digital Socialism Could be About: Ethics of Care

[Queer and feminist scholarship and analyses might prove useful
antidotes to the violence of abstraction that is inherent in the
**data-driven knowledge-economy**]{.underline}. [They can provide ways
to look at contrasting communicative capitalism not from the perspective
of individually-centred property-based rights, but from **collective and
relational modes of being** in the world.]{.underline} They can help us
to locate digital socialism in spaces other than the production of the
immaterial.

A concept that I would like to borrow from feminist scholarship engaged
in rejecting "traditional male reasoning" (Koehn 1998, 4) and underlying
the latter's embeddedness in norms and stereotypes of patriarchal
societies, is that of care. [As "care is both value and practice" (Held
2006, 9), care and the work of care cannot be separated: they are deeply
connected and interdependent. The work of care has traditionally
occupied disadvantaged workers]{.underline} -- women, migrants, people
of colour -- in activities related to social reproduction and
reproductive labour, i.e. "the set of tasks that together maintain and
reproduce life, both daily and generationally" (Hester 2018, 345),
spanning from the care for others (childcare, elder care, etc.) to the
maintenance of the infrastructure necessary to support life and work
life (cleaning, etc.) to species reproduction (bearing children).

Whether being carried out in private spaces such as the household by
unpaid workers, or in public places such as hospitals and remunerated,
reproductive labour cannot be separated from the idea of an ethics of
care. This has been made the object of several theoretical reflections
in feminist studies24 , many of which emphasise them being "a serious
and important alternative to dominant Kantian and rights-based ethics"
(Robinson 2011, 21) and, in general, a powerful antidote against the
"quasi-mathematical form of ethical reasoning" (Koehn 1998, 2) imposed
by male philosophers. [Ethics of care are characterised by an
understanding of the self that is **relational rather than
individualistic,** placing human and intimate relations at the centre of
life, in stark opposition to "legalistic contractual thinking, so
favored in traditional analyses" which might in fact "alienate persons,
rather than draw them together" (Koehn 1998, 6).]{.underline}

This emphasis on relations rather than rights, on sociality rather than
individuality, on interdependence rather than independence, on
particularity, connection, and context rather than the universality and
abstraction of legalistic contractual thinking, is what I would like to
offer to the reflection on digital socialism[. Ethics of care present a
**radical critique of liberal individualism** and its
values25]{.underline} . The work of care in itself -- through which work
at large is made possible, through which all of us are made possible as
workers and humans -- is a reminder that the independent, autonomous,
rational individual is a fantasy deeply imbued with patriarchal
ideologies. [Care work is, in fact, "dependency work" (Held 2006,14), as
it puts into bold relief how we all depend one on another, how we are
all **connected, related and interdependent.**]{.underline} It makes a
powerful detour from the rights-based approach, from the abstraction and
immateriality of the knowledge economy. It restores materiality and
relationality as central elements to the discussion on how digital
socialism could be looked at, instead of just being imagined as a timid
reformist attitude within the domain of communicative capitalism's
knowledge economy.

[Apart from it shaping an ethics that is not abstract and universal but
contextual and intimately connected to labour -- care and the work of
care, care is the work of care -- there is an aspect of contemporary
care that offers another interesting angle to the debate on digital
socialism.]{.underline} Reproductive labour, which has been
traditionally understood as women's work, and which is increasingly
occupying a crucial sector in contemporary market economies to the
extent that we can speak of a "care economy" (Hester 2018, 346-347), is
threatened by the growing automation that is causing an impending
"crisis of work" (Hester 2018, 344). This dramatic technological change
in the job market is investing not just high-income economies, but also
developing countries, further strengthening power inequalities that are
already in place.

The domain of the care economy, which once seemed the exclusive
territory of feminised (paid, underpaid, or unpaid) work, is now at risk
of being colonised in its turn by the abstraction and immateriality of
automation. The New York Times refers to a recent experiment in France
where Zora, a robot caregiver, has replaced humans in assisting elderly
people (Satariano, Peltier, and Kostyukov, 2018). Care.Coach, a
"game-changing innovation for aging and geriatric care that leverages
the best of both human and technological capabilities"26 , is
successfully providing patients with pet avatars that assist with
psychosocial support 24/7 and from a distance, while "conversations of a
clinical nature are automated through software algorithms that implement
clinical best practices"27 .

["The]{.underline} care.coach [approach is a thoughtful combination of
digital technology and **genuine human connection...**]{.underline}a
creative solution to the shortage of qualified caregivers in the US"28 ,
says Tom Grape, chairman and CEO of the Benckmark Senior Living company.
Actually, rather than due to a shortage of qualified caregivers, the
business of automated care is on the rise because of its
cost-effectiveness in a healthcare market, like the US, which is highly
commodified and competitive. "Human contact is now a luxury good"
(Bowles 2019), the New York Times has titled, hinting at the increasing
phenomenon of automation and screen-mediation taking over all domains of
human life for the working class. In stark contrast, elites enjoy the
privilege of disconnecting when they wish to take a distance from
technology, still being able to purchase nonautomated, more costly human
labour.
