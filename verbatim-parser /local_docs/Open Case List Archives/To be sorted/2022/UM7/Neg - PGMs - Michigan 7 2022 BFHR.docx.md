NOTES (from Alex Huang)

- Any DA or turn you go for has to be paired with a uniqueness CP --
  there's a generic uniqueness CP that ends aid to Ukraine and a more
  specific one that's meant to be paired with the humiliation turn

- There's multiple ways the humiliation turn can be read

  - A. Avoids issues with uniqueness -- go for any Russian defeat is
    bad, the aff has to bite the bullet on uniqueness because they've
    read evidence in the 1AC that Ukraine will lose now, which the aff
    prevents. The issue with this strategy is it gives the aff a lot
    more ground with "Russia invades more" -- this version doesn't need
    a CP

  - B. Go for "negotiated settlement good" -- requires the CP, the link
    would be crushing defeat is bad -- the aff overwhelmingly destroys
    Putin -- causes him to lashout

  - \*\*This is a [case turn]{.underline} -- there is no unique or
    [external offense]{.underline} to the turn which means it's
    extremely important to win defense to the second advantage

### AT: Ukraine War -- 1NC

#### Deterrence fails -- a Russian invasion would mobilize rebel groups to have plausible deniability AND new US weapons don't change the calculus for invasion

With Russian forces massed on Ukraine's borders, the policy discussion
in Washington increasingly has focused on what the United States can do
to help its Ukrainian partners defend their country. Just this week, the
Biden administration has approved deliveries of U.S.-made Stinger
shoulder- launched anti-aircraft missiles to Kyiv, in addition to upping
provision of other military equipment. Allies, including the United
Kingdom, are providing their own assistance, too. [The justification for
the aid has varied. Some have made the case that [U.S. military
assistance]{.mark} to Ukraine [can]{.mark} change Russia's calculus now,
possibly [deter]{.mark}ring [Moscow from launching an
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. Others claim that aid to the Ukrainian
military can have a real impact on a possible fight with the Russians,
making it meaningfully more challenging for the Kremlin to achieve
victory and ruling out certain military options Russia might be
considering. And there are also voices who call for additional
capabilities merely to raise costs for Moscow---that is, to kill more
Russian soldiers---so as to create political problems for President
Vladimir Putin at home, although without much expectation that Ukraine
would prevail. **[[None of these arguments is
convincing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That does not mean security
cooperation with Kyiv should cease. It does mean that [military
assistance is not an effective lever for resolving this
crisis]{.underline}. Since 2014, the United States has provided over
\$2.5 billion in military aid to Ukraine, following the Russian
annexation of Crimea and invasion of the Donbass. U.S. assistance to
Ukraine has included the provision of trainers, selected defensive
systems (such as counter-mortar radars), and, more recently, Javelin
anti-tank missiles. This assistance has principally aimed to improve
Ukrainian effectiveness in the relatively static conflict against
Russian-backed separatist forces in the Donbass, who are mainly armed
with small arms and light weapons, along with some artillery and
Soviet-era armor. Crucially, however, [Ukraine has mainly not been
fighting Russia's armed forces in the Donbass. Yes, Russia has armed,
trained, and led the separatist forces. But even by Kyiv's own
estimates, the [vast majority of rebel forces]{.mark} [consist of
locals---**not soldiers of the**]{.mark} **regular [Russian
military]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, the Russian armed forces
engaged directly in the fighting only twice---in August-September 2014
and January-February 2015---and with limited capabilities, although both
episodes ended in crushing Ukrainian defeats. Moscow has sought to
retain some veil of deniability about its involvement in the conflict,
which meant [the Russian military never used more than a tiny fraction
of its capabilities against the Ukrainians]{.underline}. It applied just
enough force to get the job done while avoiding protracted, overt
interventions. [A [wide variety of signature Russian]{.mark}
[capabilities]{.mark}---including its air force and ballistic and cruise
missiles---**[have not been involved in the fighting at all,]{.mark}**
even as they have been repeatedly demonstrated in combat operations in
Syria.]{.underline} The nature of the reported Russian buildup suggests
the expanded war, if it happens, will differ fundamentally from the past
seven years of simmering stalemate. Russia has the ability to carry out
a large-scale joint offensive operation involving tens of thousands of
personnel, thousands of armored vehicles, and hundreds of combat
aircraft. It would likely begin with devastating air and missile strikes
from land, air, and naval forces, striking deep into Ukraine to attack
headquarters, airfields, and logistics points. Ukrainian forces would
begin the conflict nearly surrounded from the very start, with Russian
forces arrayed along the eastern border, naval and amphibious forces
threatening from the Black Sea in the south, and the potential
(increasingly real) for additional Russian forces to deploy into Belarus
and threaten from the north, where the border is less than 65 miles from
Kyiv itself. [In short, this war will look nothing like the status quo
ante of conflict in Ukraine, and **that undermines the first
justification for U.S. aid: deterring Russia**]{.underline}**.** [The
Ukrainian [military has]{.mark} [been shaped to fight the conflict in
the]{.mark} [Donbass]{.mark} and thus poses little deterrent threat to
Russia; **[provision of U.S. weapons can do nothing to change
that]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If [[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} is willing
to launch a major war, invading the second-largest country in Europe
with a population of over 40 million, all while absorbing tremendous
economic punishment from the West, then it [[is unlikely to be
deterred]{.mark} [by whatever U.S. military assistance can be
delivered]{.mark} in the coming weeks.]{.underline} The only weapons
systems that could plausibly impose costs that could change Russia's
calculus, such as surface-to- air missiles and combat aircraft, are ones
that the United States would be highly unlikely to provide the
Ukrainians. And, regardless, they could not be procured, delivered, and
be made operational---to say nothing of getting the Ukrainian operators
trained up to use them---in time to have an impact on this crisis.
Large, modern systems require extensive training and material support.

### AT: Ukraine War -- 2NC

#### Ukraine is [terminally screwed]{.underline} -- Russian forces outclass Ukraine on [all levels]{.underline} even with new military tech

[Once deterrence fails and a war begins, the Ukrainian armed forces will
find themselves in desperate circumstances almost
immediately.]{.underline} [[Ukraine **does not have anywhere near enough
forces to**]{.mark} **credibly [defend against all]{.mark} the
[potential avenues of attack]{.mark}**, which means it would have to
choose between defending a select set of fixed strong points---ceding
control of other areas---or maneuvering to engage Russian forces that
outnumber them.]{.underline} The line of conflict in the Donbass will be
but one of many fronts. The Ukrainian fortifications there may well look
like a modern-day Maginot Line: prepared for a frontal attack that may
never come and bypassed by the mobile forces of an adversary with more
advanced aircraft and more mobile land forces. [Ukraine's great size
means that the [land forces operating]{.mark} there [will be required to
move to cover large areas of rural terrain]{.mark}]{.underline}. Mobile
engagements would benefit Russian forces, which are far better trained
and equipped to conduct coordinated air and land maneuver warfare than
their Ukrainian opponents. [The [Russian military]{.mark} has repeatedly
[practiced the use of long-range strike and tactical fires]{.mark} cued
by drones as well as other means of reconnaissance, both in training and
in combat operations in Syria. Russia's combat aircraft and strategic
air defenses give Moscow many more options to control the air and to
strike Ukrainian forces, and most Russian pilots have recent real-world
experience in Syria]{.underline}. The Ukrainian military also largely
operates legacy Soviet weapons; [[Russian forces have a **deep
familiarity with**]{.mark} **the [limitations of these systems]{.mark}**
and know what tactics to employ to further reduce their effectiveness.
In short, the [military balance between Russia and Ukraine is so
lopsided in Moscow's favor]{.mark} [that **any assistance**]{.mark}
**Washington might provide in coming weeks [would be largely irrelevant
in determining the outcome of a conflict]{.mark} should it
begin**]{.underline}. [Russia's advantages in capacity, capability, and
geography combine to pose insurmountable challenges for Ukrainian forces
tasked with defending their country]{.underline}. The second argument
for aid---changing the course of the war--- thus does not hold water.

Hence their confidence that more Javelins will improve Ukraine's ability
to destroy Russia's tanks, that additional Stinger anti-aircraft
missiles will cause even more Russian warplanes to fall from the skies,
and that counter-battery radars will locate and demolish deadly Russian
artillery. Yet amid the moral outrage and depth of animosity toward
Putin, [the [risks of pouring arms into Ukraine should be considered
carefully]{.mark} and dispassionately. Providing Ukraine even more arms
may well produce the results its proponents anticipate]{.underline}. [It
could]{.underline}, on the other hand, [impel Russian commanders to
subject Ukrainians to even greater pain.]{.underline} They have already
experienced enormous suffering because Russia, as the Office of the
United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has noted,
routinely hits civilian buildings. [If the war becomes even more brutal,
Ukraine may keep resisting, but then the number of Ukrainians seeking
refuge in other countries, now 2.6 million (the largest proportion is in
Poland), will soar.]{.underline} With Warsaw and Kraków, its two largest
cities, overwhelmed by the influx, Poland has already appealed for help.
A continuing exodus from Ukraine could strain the economies and social
fabric of its neighbors, especially if the war drags on, preventing
refugees from returning home. Furthermore, [[Russia **may not stand
by**]{.mark}, allowing the west to fortify Ukraine's army.
[Putin]{.mark} might [order]{.mark} his [generals to bomb]{.mark} the
[supply routes from Poland and Romania]{.mark}, the Nato countries that
have the longest borders with Ukraine.]{.underline} On 11 March, after
not having bombed them since 24 February, the day the war started,
Russian aircraft took aim at military airfields in Lutsk and
Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine. Lutsk lies about 60 miles from
Poland's border, in Volyn province, which adjoins it. The city of
Ivano-Frankivsk is located north of the Romania's border, and the
eponymous province of which it is part adjoins Romania. On 13 March, a
barrage of Russian cruise missiles hit the Yavoriv military base, which
is in Lviv province and less than 30 miles from the Polish border.
[These attacks are a signal from Putin that he won't stand by while the
west beefs up Ukraine's army, which has already proved a tougher nut to
crack than he anticipated, and were accompanied by the warning from the
deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov warning to the United States that
Russia would regard arms "convoys" into Ukraine as "legitimate targets".
The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and its allies may face unexpected
countermoves]{.mark} from Russia [and what they do in response could
widen the war]{.mark} [if Putin]{.mark}, in turn, [raises the
stakes]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If the tit-for-tat [spills over into
Poland or Romania]{.mark}, whether intentionally or not, [the stage
could be set for a Nato-Russia confrontation]{.mark}, [with **nuclear
weapons lurking in the**]{.mark} **[background]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Some experts are confident that arming Ukraine won't widen the war, but
if they're wrong the consequences could prove catastrophic.

### AT: Ukraine War -- Won't Escalate

#### Ukraine war won't go nuclear -- no motivation

**Finel 22** - professor of national security strategy at the National
War College, where has also served as a course director, department
chair, and associate dean for academic programs (Bernard I., "WAR
TERMINATION AND ESCALATION IN UKRAINE," *Modern War Institute*,
<https://mwi.usma.edu/war-termination-and-escalation-in-ukraine/>,
Accessed 6-25-22, LASA-AH)

Russian President Vladimir [Putin has, indeed, threatened escalation.
This is most likely a bluff for the simple reason that Russia does not
benefit from further escalation]{.underline}. Russian declaratory
nuclear doctrine does include a concept of nuclear escalation, even in
response to nonnuclear threats. This "escalate to deescalate concept,"
however is designed to confront threats to Russian national security
that Russia cannot defeat otherwise. It does not seem to be a doctrine
of nuclear coercion to achieve positive goals. [Certainly, facing a
foreign invasion or a direct threat to the Putin regime, nuclear
escalation seems quite possible, **but this is not the dynamic Russia
faces today in Ukraine.**]{.underline} [It is trying to secure foreign
policy gains, not stave off defeat. In that context, if anything,
escalation works against Russian interests because the more outside
powers are drawn into the fight, the greater the likelihood that Russian
forces will be not just bogged down on the ground, but
obliterated.]{.underline} [Russia simply does not have the military
capacity to take on NATO. With the force Moscow has shown itself willing
to commit to the conflict, **it is struggling to maintain operational
capacity just facing the Ukrainians.**]{.underline} If any NATO country
were to become involved, it would dramatically tip the balance against
Russia. It may take some time for forces to be deployed and effectively
used in theater, but the difference in numbers of key weapons systems
would become decisive relatively quickly. As discussed earlier, Russia
could escalate to nuclear weapons, of course. But to what end? Can
Russia win a nuclear exchange? It is difficult to construct a plausible
argument regarding that. [There is no nuclear option, whether tactical
or general, that provides Russia with a war-winning solution, except in
the case that a Russian use of nuclear weapons induces the rest of the
world to surrender to Russia's demands.]{.underline} But this would be a
choice, and a bad one. Instead, the United States and other European
powers should make clear that any use of nuclear weapons---not just
strategic weapons, but lower-yield, tactical weapons, as well---will
result in prompt and overwhelming retaliation. The alternative is to
hand the Russians---and potentially other states---a powerful coercive
tool that can be used in virtually any context or dispute. Signaling
that the threat of nuclear use, in the absence of a threat to state
survival, is a viable strategy for revisionist states is to open the
world to an endless cycle of nuclear blackmail. [Deterrence functions in
both directions. Nuclear deterrence is likely quite stable. It held for
the entirety of the Cold War, even in the midst of severe crises, and
has also held in South Asia despite some quite severe
provocations]{.underline}. If true, this suggests we ought not
self-deter on the assumption that the Russians would be willing to risk
a nuclear exchange. They almost certainly don't. But the risk is not
zero either. For decision makers who see Ukraine as strategically
unimportant or, indeed, a distraction from the more important challenge
posed by China, even that level of risk might be seen as too high. As
with all foreign policy and strategic debates, there is room for
disagreement, but it is important to specify the arguments as clearly as
possible.

Chances of [**a Russian invasion** of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia
appear **fairly remote**. Even]{.underline} the [RAND]{.underline}
Corporation, [which has been **particularly hawkish**,
suggests]{.underline} that a Russian [attack]{.underline} on a NATO
member-[state is low]{.underline} even though the alliance faces a
conventional imbalance. "Our analysis suggests that NATO's deterrent
against a conventional attack by Russia on a NATO member is currently
strong," a recent RAND report states. "While we assess that [a Russian
[attack]{.mark} on NATO in the near term [is]{.mark} **highly
[unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it also seems probable that Russia
will explore other avenues to signal its displeasure with ongoing U.S.
and NATO posture enhancements."

Other [analysts agree]{.underline} that [[Russia does not]{.mark} have
**any [desire]{.mark}** [to invade]{.mark} the Baltic
States]{.underline}, all three of which were once part of the Soviet
Union and the Russian Empire before it. ["The Russians do
not]{.underline} seem to [have **any designs** on the Baltic
countries,"]{.underline} Olya [Oliker]{.underline}, a senior adviser and
director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at Center for Strategic and
International Studies [told]{.underline} the National Interest. "They
are, however, increasingly aware that the United States and many of the
other NATO allies think they do. While they take pains to deny this,
they do see strategic advantage in keeping NATO on edge, and they are
certainly not above saber rattling, including in the Baltic Sea region."

Indeed, [from the Kremlin's perspective, there is **no reason** for
Russia to invade]{.underline} those former Soviet republics. While
Russia has since the days of Muscovy has had historical designs on the
Baltics---which were conquered under the Russian Emperor Peter the Great
during the Great Northern War that ran from 1700 to 1721---in order to
secure access [to the sea, **the current leadership** in the Kremlin
hopes to build up its facilities in St. Petersburg as **a
substitute**]{.underline}.

["For the past **twenty years** [Russia has been investing
**billions**]{.mark} **of dollars** [to build new]{.mark} sea[ports near
St. Petersburg, so]{.mark} **the [Estonia]{.mark}n [and Latvia]{.mark}n
seaports** [will not be needed]{.mark} any more,]{.underline}" Vasily
[Kashin]{.underline}, a senior fellow at the Center for Comprehensive
European and International Studies at Moscow's Higher School of
Economics [told]{.underline} the National Interest. ["And [except
from]{.mark} the sea[ports]{.mark}]{.underline}, which were necessary to
export Russian commodities, [[there was never **anything**]{.mark}
**really [important]{.mark}** in these countries."]{.underline}

For the Kremlin, [reducing Russia's dependency on the Baltic
Sea]{.underline} ports [is **a high priority**. "Replacing the Baltic
States logistical capabilities with]{.underline} the [**domestic ones**
was]{.underline} really [**an important priority** of the]{.underline}
whole [Putin presidency," Kashin said. ["It does not make sense to
conquer the Baltic]{.mark} State[s]{.mark}, [after]{.mark} **all the
[money]{.mark}** was **already [spent]{.mark}** [on
alternatives."]{.mark}]{.underline}

Moreover, [the Kremlin has **limited means** to attack the Baltics
**even if** it so chose]{.underline}. [**Most of Moscow's conventional
forces** are **concentrated elsewhere**---it would take time to amass a
force]{.underline} capable of repelling a NATO counterattack. Meanwhile,
the Kremlin does not have the option of leveraging the large ethnic
Russian populations in those Baltic republics.

[["'Hybrid warfare,']{.underline}]{.mark} Crimea- or Donbass-style,
however, [can **[hardly]{.mark} be [used]{.mark}**]{.underline} where it
is feared most: [[in the Baltic]{.mark} States and Poland,"]{.underline}
Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, wrote in his book
Should We Fear Russia? "Moscow's intentions aside, the local Russians'
self-identification with the Russian Federation cannot be compared to
that of the Crimeans. Even though naturalization in Latvia and Estonia
was made hard for local Russians, they are not looking to Moscow for
protection and guidance. Daugavpils is not Donetsk-in-waiting, and Narva
is no Lugansk. Poland is an even more far-fetched case. The Donbass
model is not easily transferable, and employing it on the territory of a
NATO member state denies the Kremlin any rationality whatsoever."

That means that [Russia would have to resort to **conventional military
means** to invade the Baltics if Moscow were so inclined]{.underline}.
But even there, Russia is not positioned to take such actions. [[The
Kremlin would]{.mark} have to **[build up]{.mark}** its [forces]{.mark}
in the region before launching an invasion, [which would **warn**
NATO]{.mark} of **an impending strike**]{.underline}. "There is a
buildup near the Ukrainian border. If we want to invade the Baltics,
there is need to relocate forces, potentially warning the enemy," Kashin
said.

Indeed, as Center for Naval Analyses research scientist Mike Kofman
notes, Russian forces near the Baltics are far from Moscow's best.
"Russia's military modernization and force structure expansion had been
ignoring the Baltic region until only recently," [Kofman
wrote]{.underline} in the Harvard University Belfer Center's Russia
Matters. ["Despite provocative]{.underline} air and naval
[activity]{.underline} concentrated in the area, [[Russian
forces]{.underline}]{.mark} based [[there are]{.mark} **principally
[defensive]{.mark}**[, and **aging**]{.mark} **to boot**]{.underline}.
There are indicators that a change in the size and strength of Russian
forces is inevitable, but it will be gradual, in part informed by what
forces NATO chooses to deploy."

As Kofman notes, it would be possible for Russian forces to move rapidly
from the Ukrainian border to the Baltic states, however [an invasion
would be **fraught with danger** for Moscow]{.underline}. A RAND study
had posited that the Russian military could conquer all three Baltic
states quickly using its conventional forces in as little as thirty-six
hours, but there are flaws in the analysis. The [RAND]{.underline} study
only accounts for an initial invasion of the Baltics, it [does not cover
**a NATO counterattack or nuclear escalation**]{.underline}.

"Nearly two years of extensive wargaming and analysis shows that if
Russia were to conduct a short-warning attack against the Baltic States,
Moscow's forces could roll to the outskirts of the Estonian capital of
Tallinn and the Latvian capital of Riga in thirty-six to sixty hours. In
such a scenario, the United States and its allies would not only be
outranged and outgunned, but also outnumbered," write David A. Shlapak
and Michael W. Johnson of the RAND Corporation in War on the Rocks.

Indeed, other analysts such as the Center for Naval Analyses' Jeff
Edmonds agree that Russia could likely overwhelm the Baltics with the
forces they have available. "The Russians have a clear overmatch from
there and can overwhelm them quickly," Edmonds told the National
Interest.

But Kofman as notes, [[Russia would need to]{.mark} size **its invasion
force**]{.underline} to not only beat the local NATO forces in the
Baltics but [to [fight **the**]{.mark} **entire [alliance]{.mark}** and
defeat a counter-attack]{.underline}. Planners in Moscow would have to
account for an inevitable counter-attack by the United States and its
allies, thus it would not like limit itself to an invasion force of
twenty-seven combat battalions as posited by the RAND study. Nor would
the Kremlin necessary only afford itself a ten-day timeframe.

3 Studies on potential nuclear escalation scenarios

[[The question whether Russia would use]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[**nuclear force**s in the Baltic region has]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[also [intrigued many]{.mark}]{.underline}** academics and military
experts recently. One of the most radical discussions in this field is a
blog post by Loren B. Thompson, 'Why the Baltic states are where nuclear
war is most likely to begin'. He argues that the likelihood of nuclear
war between Russia and the United States is probably growing and is the
reason why it is most likely going to start is a future military
confrontation over three Baltic countries. Thompson describes eight
reasons why nuclear weapons could potentially be used in future
warfighting scenarios with regard to the Baltics and argues that
according to the bottom-line scenario, the East--West conflict escalates
into the use of nuclear weapons in the Baltic area, and neither side of
the conflict understands what actions might provoke nuclear use by the
other. Thompson comes to a somewhat surprising conclusion -- at least in
the eyes of the Baltic countries -- that the United States needs to
reassess the situation, suggesting that it would make no sense to tie
security of the United States to countries of 'such modest importance
that are situated in such unpromising tactical circumstances' (Thompson,
2016).

Potential nuclear conflict escalation scenarios are in more detail
discussed in another publication, a NATO playbook entitled 'Preventing
escalation in the Baltics' by Ulrich Kühn. The author argues that the
risk of escalating a wider conflict between Russia and NATO is
dangerously high particularly in the case of the Baltic countries
because it would be difficult for NATO to defend the region. Kühn
suggest three possible escalation scenarios, i.e., deliberate
escalation, inadvertent escalation, and accidental escalation. All three
scenarios also involve nuclear threats; however, two of the scenarios
stop short of actual Russian nuclear-weapon usage (Kühn, 2018). The
analysis provides an interesting hypothetical construct for the experts
at both the transatlantic and local levels, as it points to many
practical issues in regard to the nuclear deterrence from the NATO's
political decision-making process to the role of domestic policies in
tackling such a crisis.

Conflict escalation scenarios that involve nuclear capabilities are
discussed also in other studies. For example, in a study called
'Reducing the risk of nuclear war in the Nordic/Baltic region' by Barry
Blechman and co-authors, two scenarios of conventional war ending in the
exchange of nuclear weapons are constructed (namely, 'Escalation in
Estonia' and 'Regional War'). Although the authors emphasize that the
scenarios are purely illustrative and [the [probability of nuclear use
is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[low]{.underline}**]{.mark}, they argue that
it is useful to reduce these risks even further and suggest two
initiatives, such as a strengthening of the Alliance's conventional
military capabilities and particularly the ability to move quickly into
the Baltic region, as well as to establish a Baltic nuclear weapons free
zone, or at least examining the possibility to do so (for further
discussion, see Blechman et at., 2015). Jüri Luik and Tomas
Jermalavičius in their article 'A plausible scenario of nuclear war in
Europe, and how to deter it: A perspective from Estonia' point to
various alarming signs, e.g., Russia's large-scale exercises incorporate
limited nuclear strike scenarios against NATO as part of Russia's
'escalation to de-escalate' strategy; Russia is expanding the range of
its tactical delivery systems, the country's political rhetoric includes
nuclear threats toward the West, and so on. They emphasize that the
Alliance's range of response options to such threats and limited nuclear
war scenarios has shrunk considerably and that the Alliance lacks a
collective will to call those threats a bluff (Luik and Jermalavičius,
2017).

A large part of the research in this field more or less considers it
likely that Russia could use its nuclear forces in the Baltic region.
However, there are also articles that oppose this conviction. For
example, Viljar Veebel and Illimar Ploom in 'The deterrence credibility
of NATO and the readiness of the Baltic states to employ the deterrence
instruments' disagree with the idea that the Baltic countries could be
under potential nuclear attack, which could in turn evolve to a nuclear
war. They argue that [[although Russia and NATO]{.mark} as potential
conflict parties **[have]{.mark} a [striking capability]{.mark}**[, it
would be]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[irrational for both]{.mark} of
them]{.underline}** [[to]{.mark} execute a nuclear
[strike]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[even as a]{.mark} measure of [last
resort]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The authors stress that [[it
is]{.underline} **[hard to believe]{.underline}**]{.mark} [that
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} [[has]{.underline}
**[any]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**rational [motivation to use
nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s in the Baltic]{.mark}**]{.underline}
countrie**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** because [a large share of [the

[**[Russian-speaking]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Likewise, [in case of a

[as well as]{.mark} Russia's possible further [ambition
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[legitimate]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
[**[annexation]{.underline}** [comes **in**]{.underline}]{.mark}[to
play]{.underline}. The argument of [[irrationality]{.underline}
**[applies also to]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** alliance [as [it would]{.mark} raise a
[question]{.mark} about]{.underline} **[[morality and
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [should NATO consider]{.underline}
using [nuclear attack as a preventative measure. In addition, [there
are]{.mark} several **[logical gaps]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in the chain
of arguments justifying the use of nuclear weapons against
Russia]{.underline} if the latter has fully or partially invaded the
Baltic countries. The authors hereby point to the following questions:

### 2NC \-- AT: Invasion

#### Baltics don't provoke Russia.

[The [defensibility of]{.mark} **NATO's [northeast]{.mark}ern
[flank]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} enlargement has [[provided]{.mark} **a key
source of [insurance]{.mark}** [by raising]{.mark} the [costs of]{.mark}
**direct Russian [aggression]{.mark}** [against]{.mark} alliance
[members]{.mark}. This is true [even in]{.mark} arguably **[the weakest
part]{.mark} of the alliance**, [the Baltic]{.mark} littoral
region]{.underline}. Conventional wisdom holds that the defense of this
region against Russian aggression is especially costly for the USA and
NATO to undertake. The countries located there are exceptionally
vulnerable. Whereas most beneficiaries of NATO enlargement are at least
largely separated from Russia thanks to Belarus and Ukraine, the Baltic
countries are directly contiguous and have only a short land connection
to continental NATO by way of the Polish--Lithuanian border. According
to this perspective, a rebalancing of alliance commitments in Europe is
necessary because the local military balance favors Russia too much and
the political will to defend the Baltic states is too low. The USA will
never 'trade Toledo for Tallinn' (Shifrinson 2017, 111).

[Note the [**contradiction**:]{.mark} According to critics, [enlarging
NATO]{.mark} **simultaneously [provokes]{.mark}** [Russia **and**
weakens]{.mark} the [alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. But what rational
cause would Russia have to be dismayed when a potentially adversarial
military alliance willingly takes on major liabilities? The alliance
security dilemma---whereby the strengthening of one coalition may
inadvertently create insecurity for another---suggests that Russia would
be justifiably concerned if NATO either incorporated states that
meaningfully aggregate capabilities or increased military ties with such
powerful states (Snyder 1984, 477). By NATO enlargement critics' own
admission, the Baltic countries sub-tract from, rather than add to, what
the alliance can do. [[Russian might]{.underline}]{.mark} have reasons
to [[protest]{.mark} [enlargement]{.mark}, but these
[reasons]{.mark}]{.underline} likely [[concern]{.mark} **the perceived
slight to its [honor]{.mark}**]{.underline} when former Soviet states
became formal defense partners of the USA (Götz 2017, 236--239).4
[[NATO]{.mark} enlargement [has not been responsible for]{.mark} Russian
authoritarianism or **international [revisionism]{.mark}** [because
it]{.mark} never threatened [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### No Baltics invasion AND [other areas]{.underline} thump.

against Russia in Europe: Military and Non-Military Aspects of
Deterrence,"

Up to now, [[when Russia]{.mark} has [used force]{.mark} **in its own
territory** or **against other countries**, [it has been]{.mark} in the
name of [protecting **important interests**]{.mark}. In]{.underline} the
case of the war in [**Chechnya**, it was]{.underline} the **[territorial
integrity]{.underline}** of the country. [Regarding Georgia and Ukraine,
Russia wanted to prevent the **expansion** of **NATO**]{.underline},
[and in Syria it was to extend help to an important
**ally**]{.underline} [and affirmation of Russia's return on the world
stage as a player with a **global reach**]{.underline} (Lukyanov 2016).
[**[None of this is the case with the Baltic]{.mark}**
countrie**[s]{.mark}**. They have **long**]{.underline} [since become EU
and NATO member states, and it is important to remember that in
international politics it is easier to prevent something from happening
than to undo a done deal. With regard to the question of protecting the
rights of Russian speakers, both Russia's intentions to resolve the
issue in keeping with its interests and the legitimacy of putting
pressure on the Baltic countries from the point of view of the current
context of international rules and regulations are
doubtful]{.underline}. In other words, [the Baltic countries are
accorded **[such an insignificant space in Russia's foreign
policy]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that [it is difficult to **imagine a
reason**]{.mark} that would be **[important enough to use military
force]{.mark} against them**]{.underline}. Since the results of using
force usually come at a cost, [it is difficult to find arguments for
launching such an aggression, for the gains would be unlikely to
counterbalance the costs. [Authors]{.mark} who have been [writing about
**Russia**]{.mark}n foreign policy]{.underline} and have tried to
explain it [in recent years [are]{.mark} therefore]{.underline}
[**[quite certain]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
**[Baltic]{.mark}** countrie**[s have little reason to be
concerned]{.mark} about their security**]{.underline}. Dmitry Trenin
writes that '**[Estonia]{.underline}**, **[Latvia]{.underline}**,
**[Lithuania]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Poland]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} **[safe]{.underline}**, however, [even if they do not
feel that way: the Kremlin [has **no interest** in risking
**nuc**]{.mark}lear **[war]{.mark}** by attacking a **NATO** member
state, [and the **sphere of Russian control** to which Putin
aspires]{.mark} certainly **[excludes these
countries]{.mark}'**]{.underline} (Trenin 2016, 29). Stephen Kotkin is
of a similar opinion: he thinks that [Russia's interest in its sphere of
infl uence in the post-Soviet space does not include the Baltic
countries]{.underline} (Kotkin 2016, 8). [Researchers are not always
right, yet in this case their opinions **clearly** point to Russia
having **no serious interests**]{.underline} [vis-à-vis the Baltic
region. Since countries usually use force to protect important
interests, the nonexistence of such interests in the Baltic region
allows us to speculate that a **military conflict in this region is
unlikely**. Russia is **deterred by its lack of significant
interests**]{.underline} in the Baltic region. Before we analyse other
elements of deterrence it is worth looking at one argument in favour of
Russia's threat to the Baltic countries turning out to be rather
important after all. [[The]{.underline} **[idea]{.underline}**]{.mark}
is [[that]{.underline} [Russia may want to]{.underline}]{.mark} [do to
the West what it experienced at the beginning of the 1990s]{.underline},
when the collapse of the Soviet Union turned the hitherto bipolar world
into a unipolar one. In the current situation, where Europe has become
bipolar, Russia may attempt [to]{.underline} **[[split]{.mark} the
[NATO]{.mark} alliance]{.underline}**, thus becoming the ruling country
in the European security system and reclaiming its sphere of infl uence
that was lost when the USSR collapsed[. In this scenario the Baltic
countries would be accorded an important role, whereas Russian actions
would be based on the assumption that NATO is nothing but a '**paper
tiger'**]{.underline}, i.e. it looks dangerous but will collapse like a
house of cards if Russia is to act quickly and decisively. Russia might
try to split NATO if it were to assume that the military preparations of
alliance members is inadequate to extend a helping hand if one were
needed by one or more member states. [In such a case an attack on the
Baltic countries would exacerbate the existing disagreements among NATO
members, cause lack of unanimity, delay decision making and make timely
arrival of help impossible. Russia would thus **kill two birds with one
stone**]{.underline}: it would destroy NATO (for there would be no point
in its existence if the members cannot help each other when facing
dangerous threats) and reclaim the Baltic countries, which were lost
with the collapse of the USSR. NATO would cease to exist because for the
fi rst time in its history, as a member faced an existential threat, the
alliance would prove ineffective and incapable of providing the
necessary help. The other member states would conclude that there is no
point to NATO and consequently NATO would cease to exist. [On the one
hand, such an argument **seems** convincing]{.underline}, because the
essence of defensive alliances is to make a positive contribution to the
security of member states. If it's not done, then other countries have
to reckon with the possibility that they will not receive help if the
need arises. By joining an alliance, countries have made the decision
that they will generate only a part of the necessary military capability
because the other members will take care of the rest. If other allies
cannot be trusted, then the point of the existence of the alliance is
lost and countries must generate the lacking military capability
themselves or change their relationship to the adversary, i.e.,
bandwagon with the source of threat. Mutual distrust and differing
interests can thus bring the alliance to collapse. [On the other hand,
the argument that alliances **unravel when facing decisive
action**]{.underline} on the part of the adversary [[**does not seem
convincing**. Aggressive behaviour]{.mark} by the adversary undoubtedly
[increases the]{.mark} **feeling of [threat]{.mark}**[, thus it is
**equally**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[possible that countries will]{.mark}
try to **[deepen]{.mark} their [coop]{.mark}eration**]{.underline} [when
external threat is on the rise. With the level of threat **rising** in
the international system, countries will try to **find collective
solutions**]{.underline}. [Under such circumstances, cooperation will be
possible not only among countries which are **already** on friendly
terms, but also countries whose relations **have been neutral or even
hostile**. The alliance between the Soviet Union and the United States
(and Great Britain) during the **Second World War** is
evidence]{.underline} that, when facing an external threat, cooperation
between countries increases and not vice versa. Thus
[Russia]{.underline} **[has to realize]{.underline}** [that in case it
engages in military aggression against the Baltic countries, the threat
it represents will **only** act to **consolidate the ranks of the NATO
member states**]{.underline} and heighten US interest in strengthening
European security. NATO has taken steps to deepen the cooperation, both
after the Russian-Georgian war and after Russia's military aggression
against Ukraine in 2014, supporting the argument that the increase in
the intensity of external threat causes balancing attempts on the part
of the countries under threat (Walt 1990). [It can be concluded that the
possibility of military [aggression]{.mark} on the part of Russia [is
diminished]{.mark} both [by]{.mark} its lack of interest in the Baltic
countries and by its **[disinclination to consolidate
NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} even more [by launching an aggression
against one of the alliance members]{.underline}.

#### Baltic invasion won't go nuclear

3 Studies on potential nuclear escalation scenarios

[[The question whether Russia would use]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[**nuclear forces** in the Baltic region has]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[also [intrigued many]{.mark}]{.underline}** academics and military
experts recently. One of the most radical discussions in this field is a
blog post by Loren B. Thompson, 'Why the Baltic states are where nuclear
war is most likely to begin'. He argues that the likelihood of nuclear
war between Russia and the United States is probably growing and is the
reason why it is most likely going to start is a future military
confrontation over three Baltic countries. Thompson describes eight
reasons why nuclear weapons could potentially be used in future
warfighting scenarios with regard to the Baltics and argues that
according to the bottom-line scenario, the East--West conflict escalates
into the use of nuclear weapons in the Baltic area, and neither side of
the conflict understands what actions might provoke nuclear use by the
other. Thompson comes to a somewhat surprising conclusion -- at least in
the eyes of the Baltic countries -- that the United States needs to
reassess the situation, suggesting that it would make no sense to tie
security of the United States to countries of 'such modest importance
that are situated in such unpromising tactical circumstances' (Thompson,
2016).

Potential nuclear conflict escalation scenarios are in more detail
discussed in another publication, a NATO playbook entitled 'Preventing
escalation in the Baltics' by Ulrich Kühn. The author argues that the
risk of escalating a wider conflict between Russia and NATO is
dangerously high particularly in the case of the Baltic countries
because it would be difficult for NATO to defend the region. Kühn
suggest three possible escalation scenarios, i.e., deliberate
escalation, inadvertent escalation, and accidental escalation. All three
scenarios also involve nuclear threats; however, two of the scenarios
stop short of actual Russian nuclear-weapon usage (Kühn, 2018). The
analysis provides an interesting hypothetical construct for the experts
at both the transatlantic and local levels, as it points to many
practical issues in regard to the nuclear deterrence from the NATO's
political decision-making process to the role of domestic policies in
tackling such a crisis.

Conflict escalation scenarios that involve nuclear capabilities are
discussed also in other studies. For example, in a study called
'Reducing the risk of nuclear war in the Nordic/Baltic region' by Barry
Blechman and co-authors, two scenarios of conventional war ending in the
exchange of nuclear weapons are constructed (namely, 'Escalation in
Estonia' and 'Regional War'). Although the authors emphasize that the
scenarios are purely illustrative and [the [probability of nuclear use
is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[low]{.underline}**]{.mark}, they argue that
it is useful to reduce these risks even further and suggest two
initiatives, such as a strengthening of the Alliance's conventional
military capabilities and particularly the ability to move quickly into
the Baltic region, as well as to establish a Baltic nuclear weapons free
zone, or at least examining the possibility to do so (for further
discussion, see Blechman et at., 2015). Jüri Luik and Tomas
Jermalavičius in their article 'A plausible scenario of nuclear war in
Europe, and how to deter it: A perspective from Estonia' point to
various alarming signs, e.g., Russia's large-scale exercises incorporate
limited nuclear strike scenarios against NATO as part of Russia's
'escalation to de-escalate' strategy; Russia is expanding the range of
its tactical delivery systems, the country's political rhetoric includes
nuclear threats toward the West, and so on. They emphasize that the
Alliance's range of response options to such threats and limited nuclear
war scenarios has shrunk considerably and that the Alliance lacks a
collective will to call those threats a bluff (Luik and Jermalavičius,
2017).

A large part of the research in this field more or less considers it
likely that Russia could use its nuclear forces in the Baltic region.
However, there are also articles that oppose this conviction. For
example, Viljar Veebel and Illimar Ploom in 'The deterrence credibility
of NATO and the readiness of the Baltic states to employ the deterrence
instruments' disagree with the idea that the Baltic countries could be
under potential nuclear attack, which could in turn evolve to a nuclear
war. They argue that [[although Russia and NATO]{.mark} as potential
conflict parties **[have]{.mark} a [striking capability]{.mark}**[, it
would be]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[irrational for both]{.mark} of
them]{.underline}** [[to]{.mark} execute a nuclear
[strike]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[even as a]{.mark} measure of [last
resort]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The authors stress that [[it
is]{.underline} **[hard to believe]{.underline}**]{.mark} [that
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} [[has]{.underline}
**[any]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**rational [motivation to use
nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s in the Baltic]{.mark}**]{.underline}
countrie**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** because [a large share of [the
population]{.mark} in the Baltic countries [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[Russian-speaking]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Likewise, [in case of a
potential conflict,]{.underline} **[[territorial
proximity]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of Russia and the Baltic countries,
[as well as]{.mark} Russia's possible further [ambition
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[legitimate]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
[**[annexation]{.underline}** [comes **in**]{.underline}]{.mark}[to
play]{.underline}. The argument of [[irrationality]{.underline}
**[applies also to]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** alliance [as [it would]{.mark} raise a
[question]{.mark} about]{.underline} **[[morality and
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [should NATO consider]{.underline}
using [nuclear attack as a preventative measure. In addition, [there
are]{.mark} several **[logical gaps]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in the chain
of arguments justifying the use of nuclear weapons against
Russia]{.underline} if the latter has fully or partially invaded the
Baltic countries. The authors hereby point to the following questions:
First, [[how could]{.mark} the [strategic use]{.mark} of nuclear weapons
against Russia [be **believable in a regional
conflict?**]{.mark}]{.underline} Second, [[how would it]{.underline}
**[help]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to solve the conflict]{.underline}**
which has already started? Third, [[what would be the **possible
positive outcome for NATO**, having]{.underline} **[initiated
m]{.underline}**]{.mark}[utually **[a]{.mark}**ssured
**[d]{.mark}**estruction]{.underline} with Russia to stop the
occupations of Baltics? (Veebel and Ploom, 2018a).

The Russians are Coming, the Russians are Coming

[When we understand]{.underline} the [**nuclear ramifications** of
thi]{.underline}s entire [discussion, it becomes clear **how
mad**]{.underline} much of the [argumentation over **conventional
deterrence** in the Baltics truly is. [There is not even a]{.mark}
**meager [attempt]{.mark}** [to explain **how
deterrence**]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[**failed** or why Russia would
**attack**]{.mark} **NATO**, despite the fact that]{.underline} through
most of the Cold War and into the present, [[deterrence]{.mark} has
[rested]{.mark}]{.underline} more [[on]{.mark} the **threat of
[punishment]{.mark}**. The U.S.-Russia relationship **always** enjoyed
deterrence]{.underline} by punishment aplenty (no offense to AirLand
warriors), [[through **nuclear**]{.underline}]{.mark} and subsequently
conventional [**[retal]{.mark}iation**. Despite the current tensions and
Russia's invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine, [there's **[little]{.mark} to
[indicate]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[this]{.mark} equilibrium [has
been lost]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Why is it **so hard** for]{.underline} a part of [the policy
establishment to understand]{.underline} that [**[NATO is not
Ukraine]{.mark}**?]{.underline} That [the [considerations]{.mark}
involved [in mauling a **weak**]{.mark},]{.underline} [**unallied**
[neighbor]{.mark}]{.underline} on one hand [[and **taking on**
the]{.mark} world's **[preeminent]{.mark} military [power]{.mark}** on
the other [are]{.mark}]{.underline} likely to be [**completely
[different]{.mark}**? Instead of credible analysis, we have]{.underline}
been treated to a series of [**ill-structured narratives** that **stack
the Russia threat** as high as necessary]{.underline} together [with
**unfounded claims** that deterrence has been lost]{.underline}. RAND's
wargamers write:

> Russia today looks to its northwest and sees little between its forces
> and the Baltic Sea but highway and the prospect of forcing NATO into
> the three-sided corner described above. Our goal was to devise a
> posture that would present an alternative landscape.

So [what's changed in the **last 16 years**? [If the Baltics are]{.mark}
such **[low-hanging]{.mark} fruit**, [why **doesn't Putin
invade**?]{.mark}]{.underline} Surely it is not a love of NATO that has
stayed his hand for so many years.  NATO is told that it has lost
deterrence and yet [[some]{.mark} mystical [force is]{.mark} **clearly
[deterring Russia]{.mark}**. Could it be U.S. **[treaty
commitments]{.mark}**, the **same thing** that deterred the Soviet
Union]{.underline} all those years? [If Russia does not take **NATO
guarantees** seriously, and is not deterred by the risk of
war]{.underline} with the United States, [then **why invade** and
threaten]{.underline} those who consider joining [the alliance? [There's
**never been** a]{.mark} Russian]{.underline} official
[[statement]{.mark} to the effect [that Moscow does not
take]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. [**treaty [obligations
seriously]{.mark}**[, nor]{.mark} a **serious [repositioning]{.mark}**
of Russian forces to NATO's borders signaling **any intent** to
invade]{.underline}. It is even more worrisome that no attempts are
being made to intellectually link the recommendations to NATO with an
analysis of Russian force posture and intent in the Baltics.

#### Their regional force posture is a [joke]{.underline} and they'll focus on [Ukraine]{.underline} and [Belarus]{.underline} instead.

Ironically, [contrary to]{.underline} many of [the **assertions** by
"**the Russians are coming**" camp, during]{.underline} the period of
[military reforms]{.underline} between 2009 and 2012 [[the Russian
military]{.mark} **moved**, [[**consolidated**, or
**disbanded**]{.mark}](http://www.cast.ru/files/book/NewArmy_sm.pdf)]{.underline} many
of the [formations [in]{.mark} the]{.underline} Western Military
[District facing [NATO's borders]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since 2013, some
of the military strength has been trickling back near Moscow, but
[[there's **no**]{.mark} **sudden [militarization]{.mark}** on NATO's
borders. Russia announced the]{.underline} creation of the [1st Tank
Army]{.underline} [outside
Moscow](https://russiandefpolicy.wordpress.com/tag/1st-tank-army/),
[though the unit has **yet to form**, and]{.underline} like NATO's very
high readiness task force, [is aspirationally named]{.underline}. Since
2014, [[Russia]{.mark}'s]{.underline} General [Staff has [focused
on]{.mark} preparing for]{.underline} another possible [[war with
**Ukraine** and]{.underline}]{.mark} a color revolution in
[**[Belarus]{.mark}**, and still **lacks**]{.underline} permanently
[stationed units on either country's borders]{.underline}. Russia's
Minister of Defense has announced the formation of three [new
[divisions]{.mark}]{.underline} ([these were already announced
piecemeal](https://russianmilitaryanalysis.wordpress.com/) over the past
two years). Two [[will
be]{.mark} [positioned](http://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/articles/2016/01/13/623777-granitsu-prikroyut) [on
**Ukraine's**]{.mark}]{.underline} eastern most [**[borders]{.mark}**,
and one between Ukraine and Belarus. [We can discern in]{.mark} Russian
**[force posture]{.mark}** and **organization** where Moscow sees the
need for]{.underline} permanently based [forces]{.underline}, a division
level command staff, [and]{.underline} the [ability to attack on short
notice. **[It's Ukraine, not NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In essence,
these will be expanded brigades formed from existing units with
division-level command staffs. [While NATO has Russia on its mind,
Moscow is **instead thinking** about contingencies in **Ukraine** and
**Belarus**]{.underline}.

This is one of the clearest examples where the ["more deterrence"
[arg]{.mark}ument[s seem]{.mark} **factually [divorced]{.mark}**
[from]{.mark} changes in [Russian]{.mark} **force [posture]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} perhaps the Russian **[military
[analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}** community as a whole.  While the field
of Russian military analysis is busily studying the layout of Russian
forces and their capabilities, large parts of the policy community are
akin to a plane flying above it, detached and unencumbered by the facts
on the ground. Yes, Russia's brigades can generate battalions to invade
the Baltics, but [**[everything]{.mark}** about Russia's force posture
[indicates a country **ill-prepared** for **war**]{.mark} **with
NATO**. The reserve]{.underline} and mobilization [system has
been [**broken**](http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/can-russia-scrap-the-draft/525849.html) ever
since]{.underline} the military [reforms]{.underline} launched in
2008. [[The]{.mark} Russian [army is]{.mark} **simply [not

#### No Russian invasion

Luke, \"Why Narva is probably not next on Russia's list,\" Apr 20,
https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/4/20/why-narva-is-probably-not-next-on-russias-list/

[[While Narva might look like low hanging fruit]{.mark} for Russia,
[there are four]{.mark} very good [reasons why it will]{.mark} probably
[not be the next place for a Russian invasion]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Out of the three so-called "Baltic Tigers[",
[Estonia]{.mark}]{.underline} [i]{.mark}s the economic leader. The
country bucked the trend of economic decline in the eurozone during the
recent financial crisis. Estonia ranked eighth in the world for economic
freedom in the Heritage Foundation and Wall Street Journal's 2015 Index
of Economic Freedom. The country [[oozes with enterprise]{.mark} and
creativity]{.underline} -- it is, after all, the birthplace of Skype.
[It is true that ethnic Russians living in Estonia do not do as well
economically as their ethnic Estonian counterparts, but the gap is
slowing closing.]{.underline}

More importantly[, [Ethnic Russians living in Estonia are far better
than their counterparts across the border in
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} The proof is in the pudding: Over the last
two-year period for which statistics are available, only 37 ethnic
Russians moved from Estonia to the Motherland. Ethnic Russians in
Estonia do not want to live in Russia.

When commentators say that the 'Baltics are next' for Russian
aggression, what this really means is that NATO is next.

Cheered US troops

When Estonia held its annual military parade in Narva this year (the
third time it has been held in Narva) to mark its Independence Day, [the
[Estonian military was joined by more than 100 soldiers from other NATO
countries]{.mark} -- including soldiers and armoured vehicles from the
US army's Second Cavalry Regiment.]{.underline}

How did the Russian speaking population respond?

Instead of throwing tomatoes at US soldiers, Estonians were taking
selfies with them. Instead of waving Russian flags, the Estonian flag
flew proudly. The crowd cheered. Sure, there were some locals who did
not like the parade, but this would also be the case for a military
parade held anywhere in the US too.

In January, the Russian backed separatists occupying the eastern
Ukrainian city of Donetsk sent a letter to the 13 twin and 10 partner
cities of Donetsk -- Narva is one of them. The letter asked Narva to
provide support to the separatists' government, and even implicitly
suggested that Narvians should rise up against the West out of
solidarity.

This was firmly rejected by Narva. City officials said that the
partnership agreement was signed with the Donetsk city of Ukraine, and
not the Russian backed so-called Peoples Republic of Donetsk. [There was
no appetite among Narvians to support the rogue regime]{.mark} that is
today occupying the city of Donetsk.

The NATO guarantee

Perhaps [[**the main reason why Narva is unlikely to be invaded by
Russia is NATO's mutual security guarantee**: An attack on one is an
attack on all.]{.mark}]{.underline} When commentators say that the
"Baltics are next" for Russian aggression, what this really means is
that NATO is next.

[In the eyes of NATO[, the defence of Narva is as important as the
defence of New York]{.mark} City.]{.underline}

So far it appears that Russia understands this. So instead of
traditional warfare, or an invasion of the Baltic states, Moscow will
test NATO using non-traditional military and security operations -- such
has cyber-attacks, propaganda, abductions, funding of political parties
and pro-Russia NGOs in NATO countries. These acts have become the norm
for Russia in Eastern Europe because Moscow knows that NATO is
ill-prepared to deal with these sorts of threats.

Russian speakers know they have it better in Estonia than they would in
Russia -- and they want to keep it that way.

After Russia's annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine,
nothing can be ruled out. For now, [[the Baltics should expect more of
Moscow's non-traditional methods of warfare,]{.mark} but as things
currently stand, [not an]{.mark} outright Russian
[invasion.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Vladimir [Putin will do what he knows he can get away with and nothing
more.]{.underline}

**Lanoszka 17** -- Alexander Lanoszka, International Relations Professor
at the University of Waterloo. \[Tangled up in rose? Theories of
alliance entrapment and the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, Contemporary
Security Policy, 39(2), December 2017, Taylor & Francis\]//BPS

[Critics charge]{.underline} that [NATO has been reckless]{.underline}
in its outreach to countries like Georgia and Ukraine. In so doing, it
has encouraged those countries to behave more aggressive towards Russia,
[risking war]{.underline} in such a way that implicates NATO members
against their own interests. The [dangers of entrapment
abound]{.underline}.

This article analyzes the different causal pathways and variables that
scholars have invoked to describe how entrapment risks arise. According
to the international relations literature, four broad sources of risk
exist. The strength of the commitment given to the ally---actual or
potential---is an institutional source. The greater the commitment, the
more perverse incentives it creates for the ally to behave recklessly.
System polarity and the offense-defense balance are systemic factors
insofar as no one country can manipulate them. Multipolarity raises the
value of allies for maintaining the balance of power, whereas the
offense-defense balance affects how a defender might manage its ties
with its ally. Reputational sources of risk arise when an ally exploits
the defender's interest to defend its commitments for intrinsic reasons.
Finally, entrapment risks can have ideological sources: An ally
strategically appeals to the ideological prejudices of its defender,
thereby reshaping the defender's own sense of strategic interests on
favorable terms. Some of these arguments regarding how entrapment
unfolds have already been subject to criticism on empirical and logical
grounds. Besides organizing these arguments typologically, I demonstrate
how uncovering clear evidence of entrapment is a difficult enterprise,
even when the theories themselves seem straightforward.

The main problem concerns counterfactuals. The [[factors that]{.mark}
**allegedly [generate]{.mark}** [entrapment]{.mark} risks can be [**so
wide-ranging** that]{.mark} imagining [a world]{.mark} in which they
operate differently [would require changing other variables]{.mark},
which]{.underline} in turn can [make war more or less
likely]{.underline}. Alternatively, [[they might not exclude]{.mark}
**other [factors]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} could [lead to]{.mark} **the
same [violent outcome]{.mark}**]{.underline}. After all, [[conflict
drives]{.mark} both [alliance formation **and**]{.mark} the likelihood
of war. [States join]{.mark} alliances because they assess that the
possibility of war is non-trivial]{.underline}. Similarly, [a defender
might be receptive to the overtures of an ally **precisely
[because]{.mark}** [it has]{.mark} **a pre-existing [desire]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} see [[conflict with]{.mark} the
[adversary]{.mark} of that ally. In social scientific parlance,
**[endogeneity]{.mark} problems** [are **pervasive**]{.mark} when trying
[to]{.mark} understand]{.underline} whether
**[[entrapment]{.underline}]{.mark}** has occurred or is at risk of
occurring. The case of the 2008 Russo-Georgian War is instructive by
revealing these ambiguities. Many NATO members---especially those in
Western Europe---were lukewarm towards Georgia's bid to become a treaty
ally, arguably because they recognized that Georgia posed certain
entrapment risks. The United States was the most supportive of Georgia,
but it might have overstated its support to Georgia in order to gain a
bargaining chip with Russia. It might have even done so because Western
European countries were so hesitant, thereby ignoring Saakashvili's
non-democratic tendencies. But by this very token, the United States
limited its response to the outbreak of hostilities between Georgia and
Russia in August 2008. [**The [Georgia]{.mark}n case**
[suggests]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[states do not forge alliances
**mindlessly** nor]{.mark} do they **[follow]{.mark} their
[allies]{.mark} off the cliff [thoughtlessly]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One
cannot by definition want to be entrapped.

[The]{.underline} Russo-[Georgian War]{.underline} of 2008 [illustrates
the need to **disentangle** the factors that push states to fight
wars]{.underline} and to seek alliances while carefully investigating
the mechanisms through which alliances fuel wars. As noted, some
baseline probability of war had already existed between the two former
Soviet republics when Saakashvili became President. Their conflict
centered on an unresolved dispute regarding the political status of
Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Neither could commit to a durable
settlement. Moreover, territorial concessions and submission to salami
tactics could have signaled Georgian weakness, thereby encouraging new
or more assertive territorial demands. Georgian leaders might have also
faced domestic incentives to stand firm towards Russia---incentives that
would have existed independent of NATO. To the extent that alliance
politics mattered from Georgia's perspective, Saakashvili might have
cherry-picked information that confirmed his beliefs regarding Western
support. Nevertheless, these factors are idiosyncratic because they stem
directly from his personality. In a counterfactual world where NATO was
not a factor, he could have had these and other cognitive biases that
would have elevated the likelihood of war.

By undertaking this sort of counterfactual analysis,
[[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[must]{.underline}]{.mark} take
care to [**[isolate]{.mark}** the [effect]{.mark} of an alliance
commitment---to the degree that it exists---[from]{.mark} **the
[underlying propensity]{.mark} of war**]{.underline}. Georgia bears a
methodological and analytical lesson for thinking about entrapment:
[**Just [because]{.mark}** [NATO was an issue]{.mark} for Georgian
security in 2008 **[does not mean]{.mark}** the [alliance was]{.mark}
**causally [responsible]{.mark}** for the war]{.underline}. Future
[[research]{.underline}]{.mark} on alliances and war [[must
not]{.underline}]{.mark} only [[identify
**correlations**]{.underline}]{.mark} between alliances and conflict,
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} also sort out various causal mechanisms that
connect [**different [causal factors]{.mark}** with war]{.underline}.

Carefully disentangling the factors that could lead to entrapment
matters not only for theory and methodology but also for policy. If
entrapment concerns are real, then defense planners must have a clear
idea as to where they come from. Some entrapment risks can be attenuated
with active policy measures. [[Conditioning]{.mark} **a political or
military [commitment]{.mark}**]{.underline} when dealing with a
risk-acceptant ally is one example. But doing so [[might not matter if
we]{.mark} have reason to [think]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[**[system]{.mark}ic forces** [make that ally]{.mark} **more
[aggressive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Strong commitments could even make
seemingly jumpy allies more secure. And so, armed with a better
understanding of what drives entrapment risks, defense planners would be
more confident in modulating political and military commitments
appropriately. As such, [[critics of NATO]{.mark} expansion]{.underline}
and American foreign policy [[may be **overstating**]{.mark} their
case]{.underline}. NATO might bear some indirect responsibility for the
Russo-Georgian War, but its culpability lessens when we consider the
other factors that increased the likelihood of war: misperceptions,
overconfidence, and the commitment problems underlying the territorial
disputes themselves. If anything, the key policy challenge is for NATO
to determine whether prospective partners like Saakashvili have
psychological traits or cognitive biases that would make them
unjustifiably optimistic about the level of support that they would
receive.

but Seldom Entrap States, Security Studies, 20(3),
https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/143890586.pdf\]//BPS

This paper explains one of the central roles of alliance contracts, the
prevention of undesirable military entanglement. While alliances deter
aggression, they are also considered to be a contagion mechanism for war
expansion.3 The existing literature on alliances argues that
entrapment---"being dragged into a conflict over an ally's interest that
one does not share"---is a major concern for potential and actual
alliance partners.4 [There is]{.underline}, however, [**little
accumulation of knowledge** on]{.underline} the phenomenon of
[entrapment]{.underline}, and contractual aspects of alliances in the
current literature are reduced to the issue of commitment as a solution
to the danger of abandonment, a concept often coupled with entrapment.5

Theorists as well as policy makers talk about the danger of entrapment,
but strangely, [[it is **difficult** to point out]{.mark} **clear
[cases]{.mark}** [of entrapment]{.mark}]{.underline}. My explanation is
two-fold: First, [[entrapment is]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[narrower]{.underline}** concept than others have realized,
[and]{.underline} it is [[**rarer** than]{.mark} the [lit]{.mark}erature
[suggests]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second, [[leaders **anticipate**]{.mark}
[entrapment]{.mark} and]{.underline} either do not form alliances when
it would be a problem or [demand **escape clauses**]{.underline} to
minimize the problem, though only to the extent that they can afford to
refrain from such alliances. Several conceptual problems have made
entrapment difficult to even observe. Most problematically, alliance
literature currently has at least two types of entrapment -- what I call
entanglement and entrapment -- without establishing explicit analytical
criteria for the phenomenon. I argue that the literature's use of the
term ["entrapment" is]{.underline} a **[mislabeling]{.underline}** of
the issue and that we need to distinguish among phenomena loosely
explained by the term. The risk of [[entanglement]{.underline}]{.mark}
(or entrapment broadly defined) [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}** component of all military
alliances, [[but]{.mark} states do [not]{.mark}]{.underline} have to
[accept]{.underline} the risk of [[entrapment]{.underline}]{.mark}
narrowly defined when entering alliances. My arguments and findings are
intuitive, but they have important theoretical and policy implications
on the issue of how states avoid undesirable military involvement in
their allies' conflicts. By explaining how to observe entrapment
analytically, this paper also illuminates the reason why [entrapment is
rare]{.underline} and yet not an illusory concept.

[I will demonstrate]{.underline} that [[states]{.mark} **[carefully
design]{.mark}** alliance [agreements]{.mark} before]{.underline} and
after [they form alliances]{.underline}, and [that is]{.underline} one
of the reasons [why **serious military entrapment** is
rare]{.underline}.7 Alliance contracts reduce the risk of entrapment by
specifying the nature of alliance obligations and conditions for their
activation. This is not a new claim in the literature, but little
empirical work has been done in its support.8 Indeed, [[310]{.mark} of
538 [alliances]{.mark} in the ATOP dataset [have]{.mark}]{.underline}
one or more [**[conditions]{.mark}** for activation]{.underline} of the
alliance obligations (e.g., specific adversary, specific location,
non-provocation by the ally), and this paper explains when and how
allies limit their alliance obligations.9 I argue that a [state's
alliance obligations are **more likely to be conditional** when it has
more fear of entrapment or more bargaining power]{.underline}, and I
test the argument with case studies of six alliance agreements.

The empirical section of this paper examines U.S. alliance agreements
with the Republic of Korea (ROK), Japan, and Spain. These cases are
ideal for my purpose, because they present variations in my explanatory
variables, the fear of entrapment and intra-alliance bargaining power,
and also because there are diplomatic records of the alliance
negotiations, with which we can directly examine the variables rather
than infer them from the circumstances.10 The U.S.- ROK alliance is
considered to be a typical case where a patron state fears entrapment by
its client, but both conceptual and historical analyses suggest that the
story is not so simple. The U.S.- Japan alliance shows that military
capabilities alone do not determine the fear of entrapment; in this
case, it was the client state that feared entrapment. While Japan did
not have enough bargaining power at the time of the 1951 treaty, it
managed to insert safeguard clauses against entrapment in the revised
security treaty of 1960. Among 26 American alliances in the ATOP
dataset, the first period (1963-1970) of the alliance between the United
States and Spain is the only one without a condition for activation.
This, I argue, is due to the low level of commitments made and the low
risk of entrapment for both sides. As concerns for entrapment increased,
however, the bilateral agreement was revised to include clauses against
entrapment.

In the sections that follow, I first explain problems with the concept
of entrapment and argue that the label of [entrapment should be more
**narrowly applied**]{.underline}. I then argue that [[states
design]{.mark} alliance [agreements in **such
ways**]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[they]{.mark} **sometimes
[get]{.mark}** [entangled but **seldom** tricked into]{.mark} **an
undesirable [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The case studies of the
United States' alliances with South Korea, Japan, and Spain demonstrate
that concerns for entrapment and shifts in bargaining power affect the
designs of alliances over time. In conclusion, I discuss the theoretical
and real-world implications of this paper.

[[If]{.underline}]{.mark} America's Cold War [[alliances
involved]{.mark} **serious [entrapment]{.mark} costs**, the historical
[record would include cases in which the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[had]{.mark} been dragged into
[conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline} and crises [[despite]{.mark} having
**[no]{.mark} direct [stake]{.mark}** in them. [There are
**few**]{.mark} **such cases**. American allies have proven **no more
likely** to become engaged in conflicts with adversaries than are other
states, suggesting]{.underline} that [US security [guarantees have not
provoked adventurism]{.mark}]{.underline}.13

True, during the Cold War, the United States faced serious national
security challenges [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} allied territory,
including [the [Berlin]{.mark} Crisis and the [Taiwan]{.mark} Straits
Crises]{.underline}. But as we saw in Chapter 2, the strong US stand
over Berlin was not a product of beneficent obligation to West Germany;
[US policymakers saw **US national interests** at stake]{.underline}.
Alliance with Bonn helped to make the US commitment to West Germany more
credible, but it did not entangle the country in an uninvited fracas.
Likewise during the 1958 Taiwan Straits Crisis, Washington had an
independent interest in averting a conflict between Taipei and Beijing;
it was not simply ensnared in an ally's woes.

The United States also entered two major [wars]{.underline} during the
Cold War, [in [Korea]{.mark} and [Vietnam]{.mark}]{.underline}. But in
**[neither]{.underline}** case [was]{.underline} its participation [a
result of **alliance commitments**]{.underline}. The United States could
not have been entangled by alliance with South Korea because the two did
not have an alliance during the war. The dynamic arguably was just the
opposite: [Washington was dragged into war because it
**failed**]{.underline} [to commit]{.underline} to Seoul in early 1950.
The United States later dangled the prospect of an alliance in order to
win the South's support for an armistice. Vietnam, the most flagrant
American military blunder of the Cold War, also was not provoked by
alliance obligations. SEATO, the US defense pact in Southeast Asia, did
not include Vietnam as a partner. Indeed, most of America's allies
opposed the US war in Vietnam, and some worried that they would be
entrapped.14 South Korea and Australia did enter the fray, sending large
numbers of troops to assist the United States, even though their own
publics opposed the war. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[fought]{.underline} in Vietnam [because of its **own perceived national
interests** and arguably paid lower]{.underline}, if still considerable,
[costs in **blood and treasure** than it would have if **not for
allies**]{.underline}.15

In the first few years after the Cold War, the United States
participated in two more major conflicts, in the Middle East and the
Balkans. [The [Gulf War]{.mark}]{.underline} was precipitated by Saddam
Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, with which the United States [did not have
an alliance]{.underline}. The George H. W. Bush administration committed
troops to repel a violation of the UN Charter---not because it was
obligated by treaty to protect Kuwait. Alliances played a greater role
in the decision to take part in conflicts in [[Bosnia and
Kosovo]{.mark}, as [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}]{.underline}tates
[sought to keep the North Atlantic Treaty relevant]{.underline} after
the Cold War. But the Clinton administration also [identified
**humanitarian interests** and [aimed to establish]{.mark} the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [**newfound global
[primacy]{.mark}** [through **leadership**]{.mark} in the Balkan
conflicts. Neither]{.underline} Bosnia nor Kosovo [were NATO
members]{.underline}.16

Given the scholarly conventional wisdom that alliances cause entrapment,
[[why is it **so hard** to find]{.mark} cases of American
[entanglement?]{.mark}]{.underline} There are several reasons. First,
[the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates has
[[designed]{.mark} its [alliances with terms that reduce]{.mark} **its
exposure to [risk]{.mark}y commitments**]{.underline}.17 Second, [[when
it does commit]{.mark} to an ally, [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[tends to construct]{.mark} its treaty
[obligations **vaguely**, giving]{.mark}]{.underline} itself [**ample
[room]{.mark}** [to support]{.mark} **its [allies]{.mark}**
[without]{.mark} **entering [conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}.18 And
third, [[Washington has been **selective**]{.mark} with its alliance
partners, [rejecting]{.mark} requests for **security [pacts]{.mark}**
[when]{.mark} it judges the associated commitments **too
[dangerous]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

A clear example of Washington's care in crafting treaty language is the
1954 agreement with Taiwan. Policymakers worried that Chiang Kai-Shek
would exploit a US security guarantee, shrouding himself in American
protection while launching attacks on mainland China. To guard against
this, the United States gave itself an escape hatch in case Taiwan used
force offensively. According to language attached to the treaty, Taipei
needed to get Washington's agreement before any such use of force. That
meant Chiang could not take just any aggressive action he wished and
expect American support.19 The alliance treaty also deliberately
excluded several islands whose status Chinese communists and
nationalists disputed. The United States opted to back Chiang through
tensions over Quemoy and Matsu in 1954 and 1958, but Washington was not
legally obligated to act as it did. During the first crisis, the
alliance was still in draft form. During the second, Washington engaged
because policymakers thought it wise to deter Mao's China. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [was not **legally compelled**
to take **any specific action**]{.underline}.

To the contrary, [**American treaty [promises]{.mark}** are designed to
[leave Washington with **room**]{.mark} **to maneuver**. Most US
alliances are triggered by an "**unprovoked attack**" on the ally, but
[**no language** spells out]{.mark} [what constitutes]{.mark}
**unprovoked [attack]{.mark}**[. Treaties]{.mark}]{.underline},
moreover, [[do not indicate]{.mark} what **the American
[response]{.mark}** [will be]{.mark}]{.underline} in case of attack.
Recall that in 1948 [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} allies sought a treaty
provision that would require the United States to automatically enter a
war if Western Europe was attacked, and Washington declined. [The North
Atlantic Treaty [and **all**]{.mark} **subsequent [treaties]{.mark}**
[promise]{.mark} American **[consultation]{.mark}** if allies are
**victims of attack**, [but]{.mark} the nature of defensive [aid is
**not specified**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[**Ambiguous commitments** give]{.mark} Washington [**flexibility**
in]{.mark} **times of [crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. When Taiwan and
China became locked in an escalating standoff in 1958, the United States
made public statements on Taiwan's behalf, moved forces into the region,
and provided naval convoys for Taiwanese ships. This was a nimble
response short of war, enabled by Washington's freedom to design its
action as it saw fit. In 1956 the United States used its leeway to stay
out of a crisis altogether. Late that year two of the closest US allies,
Britain and France, joined Israel in an invasion of Egypt. They hoped to
regain the Suez Canal after Egypt's president, Gamal Abdel Nasser,
nationalized it. But President Eisenhower opposed the intervention.
Washington felt no obligation to participate, placing the United States
in fleeting alignment with the Soviet Union and against its allies for
the sake of preventing escalation.20

[When]{.underline} the [risks of entrapment run **high**, American
leaders may **never ally at all**]{.underline}. US policymakers have
made careful decisions about which international partners they should
support, rejecting even close friends that pose excessive danger. Israel
may be the most prominent example. Though a longstanding confederate on
defense and intelligence issues, Israel is not a treaty ally. This is no
accident. During the Kennedy administration, Israel requested a formal
security guarantee from Washington. From 1961 to 1963, US policymakers
seriously considered the idea. The prospect of alliance was attractive
in no small part because US officials thought they could persuade Israel
to abandon its nuclear program in exchange. But while Kennedy's team
wanted very much to stop Israel from going nuclear, it felt it could not
offer a guarantee without risking entrapment. A particular concern was
the tension between Israel and Egypt, a country the United States did
not count as an adversary. Ultimately the United States chose not to
pursue the alliance. Today it is America's Middle Eastern
partners---Israel and several Arab states---that are most often accused
of "reckless driving," but none of them are treaty allies.21 [**Formal
US [allies]{.mark}** [have]{.mark} records of **highly [responsible
behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

\[A Critique of Hybrid Warfare in the Light of Russia-Ukraine Crisis and
Military Strategy, 5-27-2017,
https://www.behorizon.org/a-critique-of-hybrid-warfare/\]//BPS

Another flaw in the [[Hybrid wa]{.mark}rfare]{.underline} concept is
that it [[attributes **too much**]{.mark} **power to the enemy**. A
hybrid threat becomes an enemy **almost [with mystical
powers]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Cox et al., 2012). As it is indicated in
the definition, a hybrid threat, which is a state or non-state, could
employ conventional, irregular, terrorist and criminal activities
simultaneously, even by the same unit. This argument could be admitted
for a state actor like Russia to some extent, but for non-state actors
like [ISIL and Hezbollah, it is hard to imagine]{.underline}. If they
could have this ability, [they would not apply suicide
missions]{.underline}. Almost every Russian action is interpreted as
part of a well-coordinated ["[hybrid war]{.mark}fare"]{.underline}
campaign. This approach [[gives]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Russia]{.mark}n leadership **[an unrealistic]{.mark} degree** of
**strategic [prowess]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Renz (2016) successfully
points to the similarities between today and 1960s by quoting the
following text from John F. Kennedy's speech. We are opposed around the
world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on
covert means for expanding its sphere of influence -- on intimidation
instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day.
It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources
into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that
combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and
political operations. (Kennedy, 1961) Bear in mind that what Kennedy
implies in his speech was the Soviets. It is interesting to see the
similarities of enemy's capabilities referred such as "covert means",
"intimidation", "combining military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic,
scientific and political operations". Today's strategic prowess, Russia
is also frequently referred to have covert means and to conduct combined
military and non-military operations. A deeper problem with the concept
is that [it is more]{.underline} about [tactics than
strategy]{.underline}. Strategic thinking must include not only the
capabilities of forces but also the characters of forces. Professional
armies do "estimate of situation" formally for over a century and it
includes mission, friendly forces, terrain, weather, technologies and
enemy. Estimation of just enemy includes strength, intentions, morale,
technologies and tactical capabilities Strategy, as it has been already
implemented by armies, should cover, at a minimum, all the factors in
the "estimate of situation. ["Hybrid warfare]{.underline} instead,
focuses on just the tactical capabilities of enemy, which [disconnects
from the enemy itself. Within this line of thinking, **[so many pet
theories]{.mark}** have been **[crammed into]{.mark} the military
[lit]{.mark}erature** [that it becomes]{.mark} **nearly
[impossible]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} make **a clear strategic
[think]{.mark}ing** for]{.underline} anybody who adheres to the concepts
like [hybrid warfare]{.underline} (Cox et al., 2012). Renz argue that
hybrid warfare gained such a popularity that it became a concept
counterproductive to decision making and strategic thought. It might be
useful to highlight Russia's new approach in Crimea, when compared to
its less successful operations in Chechnya and Georgia, which were
characterized by excessive use of force, outdated equipment and lack of
coordination. However, [[it is not true]{.mark} to jump to the
conclusion]{.underline} that [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} had [found a
'new art of war' that [made up for **its shortcomings in
conventional**]{.mark} **capabilities** [and **posed a**]{.mark}
**significant [threat]{.mark} to the West**]{.underline}. (Renz, 2016)
[Hybrid war term **blurs the distinctions within war**]{.underline}, but
it [has the fatal risk of becoming another category]{.underline}, as it
happened by Revolution in Military Affairs, an answer rather than the
basis for questions. (Strachan, 2009) Every war is unique and requires
its own logic. It is impossible to conduct the same strategy at every
war. If we stick to a standard description (like hybrid warfare), we
might have difficulty in understanding the character of war and the
potential for change as each war is waged. It would not work for Russia
elsewhere to use the same strategy she used in Crimea. Echevarria
resembles "hybrid warfare" to "blietzkrieg" of 1940s, a label that was
never an official term in German Military Doctrine, but polished by
media and commentators. In fact, what makes Germans successful in 1940s
and Russians in 2014-2015 was not to create new conceptions of war, what
makes them successful was conducting the main principles of war;
recognizing their enemies correctly, then developing campaign plans that
avoiding the strengths and exploiting the weaknesses of adversaries.
(Echevarria, 2016) Although Hoffman states that his concept is
consistent with the strategic theory, [[few
analysts]{.underline}]{.mark} based their conclusions on Hoffmann's
specific [[understand]{.underline}]{.mark}ing of the term and referred
loosely to [**the general idea of '[hybridity'.]{.mark}** [This
resulted]{.mark} in **widely [varying understandings]{.mark}** on **what
exactly hybrid warfare is.** Analysts sometimes]{.underline} refer
hybrid warfare to [imply]{.underline} the [complexity]{.underline} war,
[while sometimes just to note **irregular activities in the
war.**]{.underline}

The [results show that in **only**]{.underline} 20 **[(30%) media

[demonstrate]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[hybrid wa]{.mark}rfare
[is]{.mark} **an [ambiguous]{.mark} concept**]{.underline} [and is
**[not]{.mark} clearly [understood]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} **different

words, there is not an agreed definition or understanding. [**Most of
the time ([70%]{.mark}),** the [authors imply another concept]{.mark}
when they use hybrid warfare]{.underline}.10 These results suggest two
potential reasons for the miscommunication. It is either because the
[authors have insufficient knowledge]{.underline} on military concepts
or [the [concept is]{.mark} **too [weak]{.mark}**]{.underline} ambiguous
to explain current events that the authors imply different meanings. We
believe that both options are valid. For instance, hybrid warfare is
confused with political warfare in 14 media items, which is
understandable as there is a similarity between two terms. Although it
is author's responsibility to know the difference between two terms, big
part of the problem stems from the broadness of the term. [Hybrid
concept has [**such an inclusive definition** that]{.mark} it allows
[authors]{.mark} to [label any conflict as hybrid]{.mark} warfare **even
[when]{.mark}** the [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} in question
[[includes only]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[part]{.mark} of
the]{.underline} all [characteristics]{.underline}. However, mistaking
hybrid warfare for information warfare is a clear indication of the
authors' lack of knowledge on military concepts as there is a clear
difference between two terms. Table 3- The Results of "author", "media
type" and "country" categories As it is shown in Table-3, [there is no
meaningful difference between academics and journalists in their
capacity to use the term]{.underline} in its proper meaning. In both
groups, only 29% of the population uses the term correctly, which is
very close to the general average (30%). This ratio is even less in
other groups, namely in experts or officials (11%-14%). Similarly, media
types also do not suggest a meaningful difference in terms of correct
use of the term. It is likely to infer in-depth implications if the
sample size is enlarged. But current numbers do not suggest any
implication. But as it stands for now, current numbers do not suggest
any implication between the degree of expertise of the author and the
correctness of the use of the term "hybrid warfare".

In trying to separate hybrid warfare from the classical bins of
conventional or irregular war, I prefer to use Frank Hoffman's
definition, "a tailored mix of conventional weapons, irregular tactics,
terrorism, and criminal behavior in the same time and battlespace to
obtain \[a group's\] political objectives." There are other definitions
out there, but you will find they are not being applied correctly to
analysis of Russian tactics. Unfortunately, [[what]{.mark} Russian
[hybrid warfare is]{.mark}, and how it works, **[varies]{.mark}
dramatically**]{.underline} depending on what article, report, or
PowerPoint brief you are reading. [[The more we]{.mark} have [talked
about it, the less we **understand**]{.mark} **it as a useful
concept**]{.underline} or framework for looking at Russian actions.
What's wrong with a little hybrid warfare? If you torture [hybrid
warfare]{.underline} long enough it will tell you anything, and torture
it we have. [[The term]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[covers
**every**]{.mark} **type of discernible Russian
[activity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, from propaganda to conventional
warfare, and most that exists in between. What exactly does Russian
hybrid warfare do, and how does it work? The short answer in the
Russia-watcher community is everything. [**[The church]{.mark} of
Russian hybrid warfare** [has **a broad**]{.mark} **and influential
[following]{.mark}**]{.underline} these days, [[but finds few
worshippers **among experts**]{.mark} **who study the Russian
military**. [There's a reason]{.mark} for that: [Many don't believe it
**exists**]{.mark}]{.underline} as described. I'm not the first to point
out the problems with applying this lens to Russian tactics , and I have
criticized it elsewhere, but in this piece I hope to offer a fresh
perspective on why the national security establishment continues to do
itself a disservice by thinking about Russia through a hybrid warfare
lens.

[By August 24, [the hybrid approach]{.mark}]{.underline} had
**[demonstrably [failed]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the vein of previous

[units]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which it had sought to avoid. The
invasion in August of 2014 marked the transition to conventional war as
the deciding approach, but with limited political and territorial
objectives. [Russian forces defeated [Ukraine]{.mark}'s]{.underline}

[[demonstrated]{.mark} the **[ineffectiveness]{.mark} of a hybrid

[and **tanks**]{.mark}; not innovative hybrid approaches]{.underline}.

[failure]{.mark} of hybrid warfare** to achieve desired political
ends]{.underline}. If it could not be accomplished there, given the
country's political and military weakness at the time, why do we think
Moscow can succeed elsewhere? Is there an example of Russia using
anything other than conventional war to successfully achieve its
political objectives, be they in Chechnya, Georgia, Ukraine, or Syria?

Close Calls Since 1945, The Washington Quarterly, 40(2), Taylor &

The Tradition of Non-Use Is Strong

[**The Cuban crisis** reveals]{.underline} that Soviet and U.S.
[[officials]{.underline}]{.mark} were able to [[**refrain** from]{.mark}
**foolish [judgments]{.mark}** even [in]{.mark} conditions of **extreme
[stress]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Adversaries have never put at stake the
"vital interests" of their opponents---either because they were unable
to, or because they never intended to, or simply because they feared
retaliation. [The [barriers to]{.mark} the **use of [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}** [were **solid**]{.mark}, and the "**tradition of
[non-use]{.mark}**" [emerged]{.mark} **very
[quickly]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

One last element of the anti-nuclear narrative deserves discussion.
[[There is **no certainty**]{.mark} **at all**]{.underline} that
[[any]{.mark} use of a [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon [would]{.mark} [turn
into]{.mark} **a [major]{.mark} nuclear [war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Yes, Cuba was a time of great danger. But why would the use of a nuclear
torpedo, for instance, necessarily have led to a global thermonuclear
exchange? Is it not at least equally likely that the two countries would
have done their best to limit escalation? It is possible, as Herman Kahn
famously argued, that [["the]{.mark} nuclear [threshold is **not so
weak**]{.mark} that [a single use]{.mark} of **nuclear weapons** [would
make anyone careless about crossing it **a second
time**."]{.mark}]{.underline}79

[[Escalation]{.mark} in **the nuclear age** [would **not**]{.mark}
**necessarily** be a [descent into]{.mark} **the
[abyss]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It might very well be the equivalent of
walking up a staircase where the last stairs are considerably higher
than the first ones. Resistance to actual use or launch could increase
as one moves up the escalation ladder---not unlike two magnets repelling
each other.

[The narrative claiming]{.underline} that [the world has stood **many
times** "on the **brink of apocalypse**,"]{.underline} or that we were
within a "hair's breadth" of a nuclear catastrophe, thus deserves
deconstruction. It discards the strength of the technical, operational,
or mental safety valves that prevent nuclear use. Stanislas
[Petrov]{.underline}, the "man who saved the world," was not a superhero
who single-handedly stopped a runaway train: he [was an **average Soviet
official** who applied **procedures**]{.underline}.

Some legitimate questions remain. What would happen if a false alarm
erupted during wartime? If a full-blown conflict involving nuclear-armed
countries erupted---something that has never happened, probably thanks
to deterrence---can we assume that caution would still prevail? This is
an important question and a legitimate preoccupation. [The [absence
of]{.mark} **any such [conflict]{.mark}** since 1945
[suggests]{.mark}]{.underline} that [nuclear [deterrence is]{.mark} **a
[robust]{.mark} construct**]{.underline}---but no human construct is
infallible. Whether it is for safety mechanisms or for deterrence, even
"virtually impossible" does not mean zero. Some would argue that any
probability of a nuclear war is too much. But surely this does not close
the discussion: a very small probability of a deadly car accident has to
be balanced against the benefits of driving to work, for instance. Is
the nuclear system "tolerably safe"?80 The conversation between
proponents of deterrence and anti-nuclear activists should revolve
around the costs and benefits equation. It is also far from certain that
such safety mechanisms and human resistance will always be present in
the decision-making complexes of all nuclear-armed states (think North
Korea or Pakistan, for instance).

Nevertheless, [a [history of]{.mark} **nearly [40
crises]{.mark}**]{.underline} with some nuclear dimension [has
[taught]{.mark}]{.underline} an important lesion: [**[solid
c]{.mark}ommand-[and-c]{.mark}ontrol arrangements**, **sound

**nuclear testing** indicate]{.underline} that [both
countries]{.underline} can [**meet this threshold** and]{.underline}
both countries\' [weapons programs]{.underline} have almost certainly
[matured in]{.underline} the [decades]{.underline} since.

In previous studies, Robcock, working with others, postulated that
temperature changes could begin within 10 days of a limited nuclear
exchange and the effects from the detonations of 100 nuclear weapons in
the 15-kiloton class would directly result in the deaths of [at least 20
million
people](http://www.nucleardarkness.org/warconsequences/fivemilliontonsofsmoke/).
The [**second order** impacts would be even worse]{.underline} in the
years that followed. 

In 2014, Michael Mills and Julia Lee-Taylor, both then working at the
federally-funded National Center for Atmospheric Research\'s (NCAR)
Earth System Laboratory, authored another paper with Robcock and Toon.
[This [study
concluded](https://web.archive.org/web/20140308191334/http:/acd.ucar.edu/~mmills/pubs/2014_EarthsFuture_Mills_et_al.pdf)]{.underline} again
that [detonation of 100]{.underline} 15-kiloton yield [bombs in a
[**purely regional** conflict]{.mark} would [result in]{.mark}
\"multi-decadal [**global cooling**\" and]{.mark} \"would]{.underline}
put significant pressures on global food supplies and could [trigger a
global [**nuclear famine**.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

It is important to note that[ critics have
questioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter#Critical_response_to_the_more_modern_papers) whether
the Nuclear Winter concept relies on too many assumptions and would ever
actually occur. At the center of many of these rebuttals are debates
about whether the nuclear explosions would truly create the amount of
smoke and soot necessary for major climate change, as well as the
specific conditions for those particles to remain in the atmosphere for
a prolonged period of time. 

The studies here do indicate significant impacts based on a relatively
limited number of nuclear detonations of smaller yield devices, though.
But even if [the impacts]{.underline} are less pronounced than projected
in this particular scenario, they [could be]{.underline} far [more
severe if India and Pakistan]{.underline} were to [use a larger number
weapons]{.underline} and/[or]{.underline} ones of [**higher yields**,
which both belligerents readily have]{.underline}. 

In addition, [[Nuclear Winter is just **one**]{.mark} of
the]{.underline} potential [[thing]{.mark}s that might happen following
a nuclear exchange]{.underline} between the longtime foes. [A
[detonation of]{.mark} **dozens** of nuclear [weapons, **even small
ones**]{.mark}, would [throw]{.mark}]{.underline} hazardous nuclear
[[fallout [**into the
air**](http://thedrive.com/the-war-zone/19450/u-s-training-for-arctic-nuclear-satellite-disaster-amid-russian-weapons-developments)]{.mark} that]{.underline},
depending on the weather pattern, [could **carry**]{.underline} that
**[material]{.underline}** [far and
wide](https://futureoflife.org/background/us-nuclear-targets/?cn-reloaded=1#nukemap),
causing both near- and short-term health impacts. The various [ground
zeroes](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/) themselves would be
irritated and potentially hazardous for many years to come.

Depending on where the detonations occur, [a nuclear exchange
could]{.underline} potentially [cut]{.underline} people
[off]{.underline} from critical [**water** and **food**
supplies]{.underline}, putting increased and potentially unsustainable
strains on uncontaminated areas.  After the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant, situated in Ukraine, [melted down and
exploded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster) in 1986,
authorities established a 1,000 square mile restricted access
\"[exclusion
zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Exclusion_Zone)\" that
remains in place today. 

[There would]{.underline} also [be]{.underline} a [major]{.underline}
danger of [**[second-order]{.mark}** \"spillover\" **[effects]{.mark}**,
as individuals fled]{.underline} affected [areas, putting **economic**
and **political strains** on neighboring regions. This could
**[inflame]{.mark}** existing [tensions **not**]{.mark} **directly
[related]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the inter-state
[[conflict]{.mark} between India or Pakistan [or lead to]{.mark} all
new]{.underline} and potentially [**violent [competition]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} what might already be [**limited
[resources]{.mark}**. India]{.underline} has [already threatened
to [**weaponize water**
access](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/world/asia/india-pakistan-water-kashmir.html) in
its]{.underline} latest [spat with the Pakistanis]{.underline}.

[Any]{.underline} serious [[impacts on food and
water]{.underline}]{.mark} supplies, [or]{.underline} other [economic
upheavals]{.underline} as a direct or indirect result of the conflict,
[[would have **cascading impact**]{.mark} across **South
Asia**]{.underline} and beyond, as well. The very threat of a potential
India-Pakistan war of any kind already caused [some negative
reactions](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/27/indian-air-force-plane-crashes-in-kashmir-says-indian-police-official.html) in
regional financial markets. Those [markets would **certainly collapse**
after]{.underline} an unprecedented [nuclear exchange]{.underline}
actually occurred, and that is before the long-term physical impacts of
such an event would even manifest themselves. 

Overall, we are talking about a sudden and dramatic geopolitical,
financial, and environmental shift that would change our reality in a
matter of hours. Even then, the darkness, both figuratively and
literally, that could propagate over the weeks, months, and years would
be far more damaging. 

How great is the risk?

So far, India and Pakistan have not made any clear indications that the
fighting is close to crossing their nuclear thresholds. Pakistan\'s
warnings about the [risks of
escalation](http://thedrive.com/the-war-zone/26642/pakistan-promises-retaliation-makes-nuclear-threats-after-indian-jets-bomb-its-territory) seem
more calculated to try and prompt India to back down.

[India]{.underline} itself [has a]{.underline} so-called [\"**no first
use**\" policy, which means it]{.underline} has publicly [pledged to
use]{.underline} its [nuclear weapons only in retaliation]{.underline}
to a nuclear strike. [However, experts]{.underline} have increasingly
[**called into question** whether this is]{.underline} truly [the case
and whether India might be developing **delivery
systems**]{.underline} more [suited to a **first strike**]{.underline}
should there be a need to shift policies.

[Pakistan]{.underline}, however, does not have a no first use policy and
has [insisted on its right to employ **nuclear weapons** to defend
itself even in the face of **purely conventional** threat]{.underline}.
Pakistani [officials]{.underline} have, in the past, [[specifically
cited this
policy](https://www.cfr.org/event/promoting-us-pakistan-relations-future-challenges-and-opportunities) as
way of **deterring India**, which has a]{.underline} much
[larger]{.underline} and in some cases more advanced [conventional
force]{.underline}, and preventing larger wars.

The concern, then, is that [this policy appears to have
failed]{.underline}, at least to some degree, [with **India\'s strike**
on undisputed **Pakistani territory**]{.underline} on Feb. 26, 2019.
India, however, did not target Pakistani forces in that instance and
exchanges between the two countries have been limited, at least so far,
to the disputed [Jammu and Kashmir]{.underline} region, where
violent [skirmishes occur **semi-regularly**]{.underline} without
precipitating a larger confrontation.

[We can only hope]{.underline} that [the two countries]{.underline} will
[find a diplomatic solution]{.underline} to this latest conflict [and
avoid any]{.underline} further [escalation. [If
things]{.mark}]{.underline} were to [**[spiral]{.mark} out of control**
and lead to]{.underline} the use of [**nuclear weapons**, [it
would]{.mark}]{.underline} be something that would [[threaten **all of
humanity**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### AT: Turkey -- 1NC

#### The alliance is over. [Any benefit]{.underline} to Turkish membership is [long-dead]{.underline}. Kicking them out just formalizes it.

**GM 19** (Geopolitical Monitor, "Point Counterpoint: Turkey Should Be
Expelled from NATO,"
<https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/point-counterpoint-turkey-should-be-expelled-from-nato/)//BB>

As such, many claim that [ousting Ankara from NATO]{.underline} is an
option to be seriously considered. In principle, this [raises costs in
the form of losing a powerful partner in a strategic position, but in
practice the problem may be **less serious than it
appears.**]{.underline} [The assets currently based on Turkish territory
can be moved to more trustworthy partners, even though this would have
some operational consequences]{.underline}. [Most importantly, Turkey's
own uncooperative, if not outright abrasive, attitude **already
offsets** the advantages its membership is supposed to
bring]{.underline}. At the same time, [expelling Turkey would allow the
Organization and its members to simply counter Ankara whenever the
latter's actions go against its common interests, and NATO would be
freed from any obligation to protect an untrustworthy ally that does
little to promote the common interest and often acts openly against it
in a manner that **undermines NATO's cohesion and
policies**]{.underline}. As such, [Ankara's exit from NATO would put an
end to the numerous problems linked to its membership]{.underline}. And,
arguably, **[it's the Turkish government itself that is choosing this
path]{.underline}**. [Ankara's recent tilts toward rival powers like
Russia and Iran seems to indicate that it is already drifting away from
its trans-Atlantic commitments]{.underline}; therefore, [expelling the
country from NATO would **simply make official** the de facto break-up
that Turkey has been actively seeking over the past decade]{.underline}.

### AT: Turkey -- 2NC

#### Turkey is actively working to help Russia and Iran, against US interests 

**Rubin 21** - is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute (Michael Rubin, "To Use Turkey as a Bulwark Against Russia and
Iran Is Wishful Thinking," July 12 2021,
<https://nationalinterest.org/feature/use-turkey-bulwark-against-russia-and-iran-wishful-thinking-189524)//mcu>

[For decades, Turkey was a staunch Cold War ally]{.underline}. One of
only two NATO members to border the Soviet Union, [Turkey went above and
beyond]{.underline} in its partnership with the United States: Turkey
contributed more men under arms to NATO than Germany and France
combined. Turkey subsequently joined the Baghdad Pact and Turks fought
alongside the United States in the Korean War. Behind the scenes, Turkey
proved crucial to numerous intelligence and counter-terror operations.
[With the end of the Cold War, bilateral relations remained
strong]{.underline}, at least **[until the rise of]{.underline}**
Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip **[Erdoğan]{.underline}**. Slowly
but deliberately, [Erdoğan turned away from the West]{.underline}. He
picked fights like a master tactician, confident that he could find
former ambassadors and others in the State Department, White House, or
pay-to-play think tanks. He artfully played and rewarded those inclined
to apologize for any Turkish outrage or desperate to preserve the
alliance. The frequency of U.S. elections and new U.S.
administrations---at least in comparison to the last two decades in
Turkey---meant Erdoğan could always find an American official eager for
a reset. Often, [those seeking to promote rapprochement with Turkey
argue that repairing the relationship is necessary given the broader
strategic imperative of checking Russia's and Iran's geopolitical
ambitions. **The idea that Turkey can be a bulwark against either is
magical thinking**]{.underline}. [It rests upon an embrace of an
Istanbul bubble not representative of broader Turkish
thinking]{.underline}, [a wholescale embrace of]{.underline} the notion
that [Turkey's depiction]{.underline} of its enemies and its narrative
[of history]{.underline} is accurate, [and an anachronistic idea that
Turkey has not changed over the decades]{.underline}. The idea that it
is possible to ignore the ideology and volatility in Erdoğan is
analogous to embracing Iranian reformists in the hope that they will
somehow nullify the influence of the supreme leader. Likewise, [to
believe that nearly two decades of Erdoğanism has not changed Turkish
society is to believe that twenty years of Khomeinism did not change
Iran. Both are foolish delusions.]{.underline} Consider, for example,
the notion that **[Turkey checks Russia's interests]{.underline}**. In
May 2010, [Russia and Turkey signed energy cooperation agreements to
give Turkey its first nuclear power plant,]{.underline} with help from
Russian energy companies. Earlier this year, Russian president Vladimir
Putin and Erdoğan jointly celebrated the start of the construction of
the new Akkuyu power plant. **[Such cooperation has become the rule
rather than the exception]{.underline}**. [Turkey's purchase of
S-400]{.underline} missiles from Russia has made headlines not because
it represents a lucrative contract for Russia, but because the
integration of S-400s into Turkey's air defense would **[require
compromising NATO electronics and computer codes to Russian
engineers.]{.underline}** [Even if Turkey kept the S-400s on a separate
system, they might be used to track and gather data on NATO air
platforms.]{.underline} In 2016, the two counties signed an agreement on
the TurkStream gas pipeline and, on January 8, 2020, they launched the
pipeline. To suggest Germany's pursuit of Nord Stream 2 is pro-Putin (it
is) but, by omission, bless Turkey's involvement in the TurkStream
pipeline defies logic. [Syria has become a flashpoint for Turkey's
Islamist ambitions]{.underline}. The reason why American officials from
both parties ignore Turkish complaints about U.S. partnership with
pro-PKK groups is not because of some conspiracy to promote Russian or
Iranian interest as some suggest, but rather because Turkey's
partnership with the Islamic State forced that cooperation in the first
place. Given how Turkey and Russia often appear on separate sides in the
Syria conflict[, it might be possible to argue that Turkey's involvement
checks Russian ambitions]{.underline}. The problem,
**[however]{.underline}**, is that **[Turkey's approach to Syrian
president Bashar al-Assad is inconsistent]{.underline}**. In May 2007,
the PKK derailed a train in Turkey that was carrying rocket launchers,
mortar shells, and light arms to Syria, likely destined to Hezbollah.
For example, in 2008 and 2009 Erdoğan was hosting joint cabinet meetings
with Assad and vacationing with the Syrian dictator on the coast of the
Mediterranean Sea. Certainly, the Syrian civil war changed perspectives
but, on January 24, 2017, [Russia, Turkey, and Iran signed an agreement
to establish de-escalation zones and essentially cooperate to create
spheres of influence in Syria]{.underline}. Damascus and Ankara
replicated the same model in Libya and in Nagorno-Karabakh as well.
Officials in both Armenia and Artsakh---as the self-styled Armenian
state in Nagorno-Karabakh calls itself---openly speculate that [Turkey
traded influence in Idlib to Russia in exchange for the Kremlin agreeing
to greater Turkish involvement in the South Caucasus.]{.underline} It is
true that [Turkey's relationship with Russia has not always gone
smoothly]{.underline}. In October 2012, Turkey forced a Syrian passenger
plane to land, accusing it of carrying Russian munitions leading Russian
officials to accuse Turkey of endangering Russian passengers. Three
years later, Turkey shot down a Russian military jet close to the Syrian
border. Putin called the move a "stab in the back." Russia suspended
military contracts, instituted a travel ban against Turkey, and
implemented sanctions in response. After Erdoğan apologized**[, however,
Russo-Turkish relations resumed where they had left off]{.underline}**.
Erdoğan's use of the Gülen bogeyman to deflect blame from the
consequences from his own policy choices proved useful in papering over
other crises, such as when an off-duty Turkish police officer
assassinated the Russian ambassador to Turkey. [Certainly, tensions
remain]{.underline} and the Kremlin is not afraid to play hardball with
Erdoğan but whether out of ideological symbiosis or trade, **[neither
Erdoğan nor Putin appears willing to break their embrace]{.underline}**.
The two leaders have met nearly two dozen times in either Turkey or
Russia since 2012, and that figure does not include phone calls, video
conferences, or mutual attendance at multiparty summits in third
countries. Nor does it factor in Turkish intelligence chief Hakan
Fidan's frequent travels to Moscow. The money at stake is significant.
In 2019, Turkey's exports to Russia totaled \$4.15 billion, and Russian
exports to Turkey were five times that amount. It is likewise farcical
to believe Turkey can be a bulwark against Iranian influence. When, in
2010, [Erdoğan appointed Fidan]{.underline} to be his intelligence
chief, alarm bells sounded in Western capitals where his Western
counterparts knew him as [an Iran sympathizer if not an
asset]{.underline}. To couch a renewed Turkish alliance as good for
Israel or Jews is absurd. [Fidan not only personally supervised efforts
to unravel Turkey-Israel ties but also ordered Turkish intelligence
actively to monitor Jews.]{.underline} He killed two birds with one
stone when [he allegedly exposed an Israeli spy ring targeting Iran's
nuclear program and has also betrayed intelligence to Hamas and
China.]{.underline} [Under Fidan]{.underline}, [Turkey]{.underline} also
[endangered American forces by exposing the locations and supplies of
U.S. forces operating in Syria.]{.underline} To suggest, in each case,
that Turkey is simply acting in pique toward some sleight or following
its own interests misses the point. [Strong allies share not only
short-term interests but also a broader ideological base]{.underline}.
This has been the key to ensuring the stability of the post--World War
II liberal order. [The Turkish government,]{.underline} however, **[no
longer shares common values with the United States or the
West]{.underline}.** Nor after two decades bombarded by vile
anti-Western, anti-Semitic propaganda does a Turkish public, at least
that beyond a few central Istanbul neighborhoods, some more cosmopolitan
areas in Ankara, and the Mediterranean coast. Forty percent of the
Turkish population has lived the entirety of their conscious lives under
Erdoğan's domination. To excuse Erdoğan as transactional is equally
bizarre. In times of crises, allies do not seek to engage both sides in
a bidding war for Turkey's affection but that is at best what Erdoğan
now tries to do. Turkey is skilled at caviar diplomacy; I know. While I
never solicited nor received Turkish money (or that of any other foreign
state), I was a frequent guest at Turkish conferences until the Erdoğan
regime grew frustrated with both my refusal to promote its party line
and my willingness to talk directly in the spirit of independent
research to those it deemed enemies. [Turkey continues to throw out the
red carpet for those who amplify its narrative and offers golden
parachutes for diplomats who amplify Turkish interests]{.underline}.
Conversely, it [restricts access to academics and policy analysts who do
not tow its party line.]{.underline} Such [enticement]{.underline},
however, [is]{.underline} not only intellectually dishonest but also
makes for [buffoonish]{.underline} policy prescriptions, the notion
[that Turkey today can be a bulwark against Russia and Iran chief among
them.]{.underline}

## Advantage Two

### AT: DIB Adv\-\--1NC 

#### Arm sales not key to the DIB

Eugene **Gholz, 2019** Associate professor of political science at the

[Conventional arms transfers can have separate, microeconomic
effects]{.underline} of interest to a discussion of economic security,
including effects on innovation and manufacturing highlighted in the
Presidential Memorandum. **[The [defense industry is not]{.mark} like [a
normal]{.mark} commercial [industry]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[where]{.underline} **[corporations use retained earnings from their
past sales]{.underline}**---or borrowing from investors, who expect to
be repaid from future sales revenue---to **[invest in research and
development]{.underline}**.18 [[Innovation]{.mark} in the defense
industry]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} mostly **[[supported by
direct]{.mark} [government]{.mark} research and development (R&D)
[contracts]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is, **[the DOD customer directs
the trajectory of innovation and pays for specific R&D
effort]{.underline}**. [Another fraction of total defense R&D comes from
companies' Independent Research and Development (IR&D)
expenditures]{.underline}, **[reimbursed by the
government]{.underline}** as part of the overhead cost of other
government-funded defense projects. IR&D spending is company directed,
but it is also paid for by the DOD customer, **[not drawn from the
company's retained earnings]{.underline}**. [As a result, general
increases in defense firms' profitability]{.underline}---**[which might
stem from [arms sales]{.mark} approved under the CAT policy---[do
not]{.mark} generally have much [effect]{.mark} on defense
[innovation]{.mark} at the systems level.]{.underline}** However, many
suppliers in the defense supply chain operate on commercial terms, and
for them, the general added revenues from expanded defense sales
contribute to the retained earnings that support their R&D investment.19
Thus, at the supplier level, arms sales can contribute to US innovation.
However, [generally, the suppliers are less visible, as are the
innovations they might choose to invest in with the marginal dollar of
income. Due to that lack of visibility, it would be difficult for an
economic assessment, as part of the CAT approval process, to give much
weight to the potential innovation-related investments by commercial
firms at lower tiers of the defense supply chain]{.underline}

Is this just another case of Trumpian exaggeration, aimed at portraying
him as a master deal maker who can bring good jobs to America in general
and the heartland in particular, or is there more to it? [There's no
question that particular companies benefit from Saudi sales. The bulk of
the [more than \$150 billion in U.S. arms offers to
Riyadh]{.mark}]{.underline} since 2009 [have involved]{.underline} four
of America's top five defense contractors -- [Lockheed Martin, Boeing,
Raytheon, and General Dynamics]{.underline} -- in deals that have
involved everything from combat aircraft to tanks to missile defense
systems to armored vehicles to combat ships. The most controversial
deals have involved precision-guided munitions that have been used by
Saudi Arabia in its brutal war in Yemen, which has sparked one of the
world's worst humanitarian catastrophes. And [all of these firms are
seeking to grow their export markets]{.underline}, both [to increase
profits and]{.underline} to [provide insurance against the ups and downs
of the Pentagon procurement budget]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} the
truth of the matter is that [U.S. [firms could **do without** sales to

current [Pentagon budget]{.mark} is at one of the highest levels since

that are the leading weapons exporters. This is particularly true when
one considers]{.underline} that the most likely outcome would [not be a
total ban on sales]{.underline} to Saudi Arabia, [but a prohibition on
weapons most relevant to the Yemen war -- precision-guided munitions in
particular. **Other deals**]{.underline}, [like a lucrative]{.underline}
\$15 billion [sale of the Lockheed Martin THAAD missile defense

### DIB Low\-\--2NC

#### DIB is dead now. 

**Clark 21** (Maya,research assistant in The Heritage Foundation's
Center for National Defense, focusing on defense industrial base issues.
Rhttps://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/bidens-supply-chain-executive-order-doesnt-boost-the-defense-industrial-base-and)

Last week, President Joe [[Biden signed a]{.mark} far-reaching
e**[x]{.mark}**ecutive **[o]{.mark}**rder calling [for supply chain
reviews]{.mark} across many economic sectors deemed strategically
significant]{.underline}. For some sectors, these efforts are
unprecedented---and problematic. But such reviews are nothing new
[with[in the defense industry]{.mark}]{.underline}[---]{.mark}and that's
what makes the defense aspects of this order such a good move.

The "Executive Order on America's Supply Chains" has two parts. First,
it calls for a one-hundred-day supply chain reviews for four strategic
sectors: semiconductors; critical minerals, including rare earth
elements; pharmaceuticals, and high-capacity batteries (like those used
in electric vehicles).

Second, [it requires various executive agencies to conduct in-depth
assessments of]{.underline} numerous industrial bases: [the defense
industrial base,]{.underline} but also the newly-coined "public health
and biological preparedness industrial base," a "transportation
industrial base," "agricultural base," "information and communications
technology (ICT) industrial base" and an "energy industrial base." The
agencies must submit their reports to the president within a year.

Whether it's a good idea to refer to certain parts of the U.S. economy
as "industrial bases" is doubtful. Nor is it the proper role of the
federal government to study these private industries' strengths and
weaknesses.

But the defense industrial base is different, and always has been.
[The]{.underline} Biden administration's [move]{.underline} to study,
assess, and report on the health of particular defense-related sectors,
as well as the defense industrial base as a whole, [could]{.underline}
aid efforts [[to mitigate national security risks.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The defense industrial base comprises many private sector firms
providing goods and services that support the U.S. military, as well as
a network of government depots, arsenals and facilities. This base spans
a variety of sectors (shipbuilding, munitions, radar and electronics,
etc.) and encompasses extremely large firms (e.g., Lockheed Martin and
Huntington Ingalls Industries) as well as small businesses making
specialty components.

What brings these diverse firms and sectors under the title of "defense
industrial base" is their criticality to the country's ability to defend
itself and its interests. In a conflict, the United States would depend
on all of these firms and its government installations to supply the
tools the military needs.

But [[trends]{.underline}]{.mark} in the defense industrial base **[are
[weaken]{.mark}ing [its ability to meet the current needs]{.mark} of the
U.S. military, [let alone respond in an armed
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Domestic [[infrastructure]{.mark} for
the manufacture and maintenance of defense items
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[outdated]{.underline}]{.mark}, creating
risks for both service members and for workers in these facilities.
[Some]{.underline} defense [[components are available from only one
supplier]{.mark}.]{.underline} Others are only produced overseas---in
some cases by America's competitors, like China. For example, 84 percent
of the Defense Department's electronics components suppliers are located
overseas.

[[Policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark} in Congress, the White House, and
the Pentagon all [need [to respond]{.mark}]{.underline} to these threats
to U.S. national security. But in order [to fix the problem, they [need
a clearer idea of what the problem is]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[This is where Biden's new e**x**ecutive **o**rder comes

links in that chain, which in turn [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} help make
efforts to [[shore up]{.underline}]{.mark} those [[weak
links]{.underline}]{.mark} more targeted and effective. The review of
the semiconductor supply chain will hopefully provide similar
information for a predominantly commercial sector that is also vital to
defense systems.

#### F-35 cuts are thumped, but government funding steps in

Aaron **Mehta 3-20**-2020 {Aaron Mehta is Deputy Editor and Senior
Pentagon Correspondent for Defense News, covering policy, strategy and
acquisition at the highest levels of the Department of Defense and its
international partners. "How coronavirus could impact the defense supply
chain."
https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2020/03/20/how-coronavirus-could-impact-the-defense-supply-chain/}//JM

WASHINGTON --- As the American defense industry tries to assess the way
forward under the new coronavirus pandemic, it should keep a close eye
on the lower tiers of its supply chain, analysts warn. There are two key
factors when considering supply chain logistics: production and
delivery. On the production side, hurdles include the potential for
[[workers]{.underline}]{.mark} to [have to **[halt production]{.mark}**
work due to the spread of the virus --- something that has
happened]{.underline}, albeit temporarily[, [at F-35 production
spots]{.mark}]{.underline} in Italy and Japan --- [[as well as economic
impacts]{.mark}.]{.underline} Paul Scharre, director of the Technology
and National Security Program at the Center for a New American Security,
said that trying to predict the supply chain's future is like looking
into a crystal ball that is zooming by your face at 100 mph.
"[For]{.underline} companies that are predominantly [[defense
companies]{.mark}, government [money is likely to keep
coming]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said. "The [[real source of disruption
is]{.underline}]{.mark} if there are [**[statewide]{.mark} mandated
[shutdowns]{.mark}** saying: 'Don't go to work.' " [Small
businesses]{.mark}]{.underline} may [feel the economic pain the
most]{.underline}, and that could spell trouble down the road. A 2018
[Pentagon report]{.underline} on the defense-industrial base [warned of
"domestic [extinction" among]{.mark} the [sole suppliers for
**critical**]{.mark} **industrial [parts]{.mark}**]{.underline} ---
shops that could fold under rough economic conditions as the world is
seeing now. For instance, there [are only four American suppliers with
the capability to manufacture]{.underline} large, complex, single-pour
[aluminum]{.underline} and magnesium sand [castings needed to support
American air power.]{.underline} Those [suppliers "face **perpetual
financial risk** and experience bankruptcy threats]{.underline} and
mergers mirroring the cyclicality of DoD \[Department of Defense\]
acquisition," the report said. And there is only one qualified source
for the upper, intermediate and sump housing for an unnamed heavy-lift
platform used by the Marines (potentially the CH-53 King Stallion) that
around 2017 went through bankruptcy proceedings. "Without a qualified
source for these castings, the program will face delays, impeding the
U.S. ability to field heavy lift support to Marine Corps expeditionary
forces," the report said. Warned Martijn Rasser, a senior fellow at the
Center for a New American Security: "For small business, a shutdown
would be extremely difficult to get through because even with bailouts
and economic stimulus, [[once those]{.mark} businesses [close]{.mark}
up, [its]{.mark} **really [hard to get]{.mark} those [started
again]{.mark}**."]{.underline} "If an airline goes out of business, the
planes don't disappear --- you can start over. If it's a highly
specialized manufacturing company, those [employees]{.underline} are
going to [disperse and try to find other work]{.underline}. So I think
that's something to be very cognizant of because of all the
consolidation in the defense industry," he added. ["If they have to
curtail operations]{.underline} for an extended period of time, it's
[extremely difficult to get it going again."]{.underline} Transportation
of goods is another potential issue to watch, particularly as the
commercial aviation industry is shutting down huge chunks of its
operations. Noted Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies: "What if parts of our transportation sector shut
down so parts can't ship, or they're late shipping?" That may already be
happening, with cargo carriers reporting increased demand for shipping
goods globally. A Thursday report on industry trade publication Air
Cargo World warned that the "air cargo industry is seeing daily slashes
to airfreight capacity and massive jumps in rates due to the extensive
number of passenger flights cancelled globally as part of the effort to
mitigate the spread of COVID-19. As a result, space on most trade lanes
is tight and some even have backlogs." **[[Travel
restrictions]{.underline}]{.mark}** between countries could
**[[complicate]{.underline}]{.mark}** issues, given the increasing
global nature of the supply chain on programs such [as the
**[F-35]{.mark}** fighter jet. A delay of parts getting from a tier 4 to
tier 3 supplier could turn into a delay from a tier 3 to tier 2
supplier, and in turn could lead to a delay in delivery of a defense
article]{.underline} to the Pentagon. Still, the delays don't currently
look likely to be too serious in context, said Byron Callan of Capital
Alpha Partners.

### Europe Shields\-\--2NC

#### Europe DIB would fill in, solves the impact- they're interoperable with the US

**Theohary 16** (Catherine, Specialist in National Security Policy and
Information Operations, Congressional Research Service. December 19.
\"Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 2008-2015\"
https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/R44716.pdf)

The major [West [European suppliers]{.mark}]{.underline}, individually,
[have [enhanced their]{.mark} competitive [position in]{.mark} weapons
exports through strong government marketing support for their foreign
[arms sales. All of them can produce]{.mark} both [advanced]{.mark} and
basic air, ground, and naval weapon [systems]{.mark}. The four major
West European suppliers have sometimes [competed]{.mark} successfully
for arms sales contracts with developing nations [against the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates, which has tended to sell to
several of the same major clients, especially to the Persian Gulf states
that see the United States as the ultimate guarantor of Gulf security.
The continuing demand for U.S. weapons in the global arms marketplace,
from a large established client base, has created a more difficult
environment for individual West European suppliers to secure large new
contracts with developing nations on a sustained basis]{.underline}.
Yet, as the data indicate, the major West European suppliers continue to
make significant arms transfer contracts each year. In 2015, a contract
with Qatar for the Rafale fighter jet and missiles for a value of \$7.1
billion contributed to France's record-setting export total, along with
a contract with Egypt for two dozen Rafale fighter jets and a naval
frigate worth nearly \$6 billion.

[An effort to enhance their market share of the arms trade in the face
of the strong demand for U.S. defense equipment, among other
considerations, was a key factor in inducing European Union (EU) member
states to adopt a new code of conduct for defense procurement
practices]{.underline}. This code was agreed on November 21, 2005, at
the European Defense Agency's (EDA) steering board meeting. Currently
voluntary, the EU hopes it will become mandatory, and through its
mechanisms foster greater cooperation within the European defense
equipment sector in the awarding of contracts for defense items. **[By
successfully securing greater intra-European cooperation in defense
program planning and collaboration in defense contracting, [the EU hopes
that the d]{.mark}efense [i]{.mark}ndustrial [b]{.mark}ases [of]{.mark}
individual [EU states will be preserved]{.mark}, thereby enhancing the
capability of European defense firms [to compete for arms sales
throughout the world.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Some European arms
companies have begun, and others completed the phasing out of production
of certain types of weapon systems. [These suppliers have increasingly
sought to engage in joint production ventures with other key European
weapons suppliers or even client countries in an effort to sustain major
sectors of their individual defense industrial bases---even if a
substantial portion of the weapons produced are for their own armed
forces]{.underline}. Examples are the Eurofighter and Eurocopter
projects. A few [[European suppliers]{.underline}]{.mark} have also
adopted the strategy of [[cooperat]{.underline}]{.mark}ing in defense
production ventures [[with the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates such as the Joint Strike Fighter
(JSF), rather than attempting to compete directly, thus meeting their
own requirements for advanced combat aircraft while positioning
themselves to share in profits resulting from future sales of this new
fighter aircraft.7

### Arms Sales Not Key\-\--2NC

#### Arm sales aren't even profitable

Trevor **Thrall**, 4-5-**2019**, associate professor in the Schar School
of Policy and Government at George Mason University and a senior fellow
at the Cato Institute, \"The False Promises of Trump's Arms Sales\",
Defense One,
https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2019/04/false-promises-trumps-arms-sales/156071/

[Weakening the economic rationale]{.underline} even further [is the fact
that in order to seal major deals]{.underline}, **[American defense
[contractors]{.mark} have to [offer]{.mark} massive discounts, or
[offsets]{.mark},]{.underline}** [to the purchasing nations [in]{.mark}
the **form of [coproduction]{.mark}**]{.underline} arrangements **[[or
technology transfer]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In 2014, for example, these
[offsets equaled roughly one-third of the value of total U.S. arms
sales]{.underline}. [[These]{.mark} offsets [mean]{.mark} not only that
American arms **[sales are less profitable than they
appear]{.mark}**]{.underline} on paper, [[but also]{.mark} that they
[lead **to fewer jobs**]{.mark} **created in the United States than
many,**]{.underline} including the president, would like to
**[think]{.underline}**. [Trump's big Saudi arms deal,]{.underline} for
example, [would]{.underline} likely [lead to]{.underline} somewhere
between 20,000 and 40,000 jobs, or **[less than two-tenths of one
percent of the American labor market]{.underline}**. [The unpleasant
truth is that the underwhelming [economic benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[cannot justify]{.mark} Washington's love of [arms
sales]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Arms sales simply do not benefit the
U.S. economy]{.underline}** nearly as much as Trump likes to claim.
[Meanwhile, a large]{.underline} [percentage of American arms sales goes
to countries with horrible human rights records]{.underline}, to nations
where arms are at risk of finding their way into the wrong hands, and
[to nations embroiled in]{.underline} dangerous and
[destabilizing]{.underline} [conflicts]{.underline}. Given this, it is
long past time to rethink American arms sales policy.

#### And the military won't even use the new technology created anyways so they can't solve hegemony

Leo **Blanken 18,** associate professor of defense analysis at the Naval
Postgraduate School in Monterey, California., 1-29-2018, \"America's
Military Is Choking on Old Technology,\" Foreign Policy,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/29/americas-military-is-choking-on-old-technology/

[The current rate of technological change may make many current U.S.
military systems obsolete in the coming decades]{.underline} Advances in
artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, material science, and
nanotechnology threaten to produce qualitative --- not just incremental
--- change in the conduct of warfare in the near future. Although the
U.S. has spent far more on standing military forces than other
countries, for far longer, this accumulated advantage is also a
vulnerability. [It presents an opportunity for Washington's
international adversaries and competitors to reap the advantage of their
backwardness and leapfrog the U.S. with emerging
technology]{.underline}. [[This is exacerbated by the Pentagon's
commitment to **significant investment in existing systems**]{.mark},
the proverbial "last year's model]{.underline}." [There are **many
hindrances** to efficiently divorcing the U.S. military from old
technologies]{.underline}. [First, [for tech]{.mark}nology [to
be]{.mark} widely [adopted]{.mark} across an enterprise like the
Pentagon, [it needs to be woven into bureaucratic
structures]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[which are inherently
sticky]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Recruitment and training of personnel for
specialized skill sets, the development and implementation of standard
operating procedures, costly facilities, maintenance, and other
supporting investments are necessary to enable the use of technology.
[Further, [bureaucracies]{.mark} often build their identities around
technology, turning threats to the technology into threats to the
organization's very essence]{.underline}. [The resulting entities
[are]{.mark} often large, complex, and [full of self-interested actors
who seek to maintain]{.mark} and expand [their]{.mark}]{.underline}
bureaucratic [[realms]{.underline}. **[Once these]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[organizations [exist, they are]{.mark} extremely [difficult
to dismantle]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Therefore, if a bureaucracy and its
culture have been "purpose-built" around a particular technology, then
it may be extremely difficult to nimbly leverage new technologies. [The
revolution in naval architecture (wood to iron) and propulsion systems
(sail to steam) in the late 19th century is a great example of
this]{.underline}. Despite proving their value during the Civil War,
steam-powered ironclads faced vociferous opposition in the 1870s from
naval leadership, who sought to undermine these technologies and the new
class of professional engineers associated with them. William McBride
summarized this conundrum when he said, "Military hierarchies seek
stability, and when a new technology challenges that stability, the
reaction can be sharp and hostile." The Pentagon and the supporting
defense industrial base's adverse reaction to the Third Offset Strategy
underscored this dynamic. [New technology may also offend the
romanticized values of a profession]{.underline}. One anonymous British
observer, upon seeing an ironclad ship for the first time in 1861,
bemoaned: "It is not to be supposed for a moment that our high-spirited
youth of the aristocracy, and our race of seamen ... would practise a
profession of butchery and destruction from behind iron walls ... Those
who know any thing of sailors must see the charm of the life which
animates them; and it is only surprising that any who confess their
sympathy for the profession should be advocating the construction of
engines (they cannot be called ships) devoted to all the grossness and
barbarity of war, while they are deprived of every thing attractive to a
sailor." [The Pentagon has experienced a similar sentiment today with
institutional pushback against drones. The Air Force and Navy continue
to wrestle with recruitment, retention, and career advancement within
the drone operator community, due to among other factors, a preference
toward the existing manned warplane community]{.underline}.
**[[Compounding]{.mark} the challenge of [cultural resistance is the
fact that]{.mark} a set of [external interest groups can accrue around
the maintenance of a particular military
technology]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [Major [defense firms and
lobbyists]{.mark} seeking profits and members of Congress seeking jobs
in their districts [ensure]{.mark} that [legacy defense programs
continue for years]{.mark} [beyond their "state of the art"
days]{.mark}.]{.underline} [For these actors, [replacing and upgrading
existing systems with expensive new features]{.mark} (referred to as
"gold-plating") [seems to be the safest way to satisfy their parochial
interests.]{.mark}]{.underline} Nick Kotz's classic study of the B-1
bomber shows how major investment in military technology can be driven
by such interests. Rather than adjusting investments to changing
conditions (improved Soviet air defenses), older concepts (manned
strategic bombers) were fitted with ever more extravagant technologies.
Such dynamics also exist with the Trident submarine, MX missile, and
even the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. They run the risk of resulting in
what Mary Kaldor coined a "baroque arsenal" of expensive and outdated
platforms that bog down force structure. Simple logic dictates that a
race to acquire new technology while simultaneously maintaining
investments in obsolete technology will result in bankruptcy. The
private sector would suffer from the same affliction if it were not for
the fact that markets help tear down old technologies as soon as new
ones emerge. But that doesn't happen nearly as efficiently in government
bureaucracies. [Since their [work is not disciplined by commercial
market]{.mark} [forces,]{.mark} they allow [ineffective
technologies]{.mark} and the companies that support them to
[survive]{.mark} --- [and]{.mark} even [thrive]{.mark} --- simply [due
to their ability to navigate the political system]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[This is best exemplified by Defense contractors that build their
technology platforms in numerous congressional districts]{.underline}.
Given the political cost of potential job losses, these platforms and
their associated jobs become difficult not only to eliminate but even to
modify in a significant way. Acquisition professionals in the Pentagon
do not necessarily need to slash and burn their way through their
existing technology but they do need to commit to a strategy that
recognizes the changing technological landscape and the threats it
already poses. A senior official, whether it be the chief management
officer or the new undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment,
should be specifically charged with identifying obsolete technological
investments and supporting their replacement. This does not need to be a
zero-sum game where equipment is scrapped never to be seen, or replaced,
again. As the National Defense Strategy makes clear, defense leaders can
reduce institutional resistance by ensuring new technologies directly
address existing missions. There are several notable examples of
initiatives that do so, such as the Defense Innovation Unit --
Experimental, SOFWERX, and the U.S. Army's Asymmetric Warfare Group and
Mad Scientist initiative. These specialized entities have been created
to identify, vet, and integrate innovations from the emerging tech
environment; a parallel effort needs to be focused on shedding obsolete
technologies, as necessary.

invasion?," *Taiwan News*, 5-16-22,

LASA-AH)

[Taiwan suffers as well from the Biden Administration's and Congress'
enthusiasm for supporting Ukraine]{.underline}. Why? First, [[U.S.
extravagant gifting]{.mark} of weapons [to Ukrainian **forces**]{.mark}
**[tradeoffs]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [the U.S. ability to aid
other]{.mark}**[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. [U.S. [weapons]{.mark}
[stockpiles]{.mark} [are shrinking to levels that **imperil the
ability**]{.mark} **of U.S. forces [to fight]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
[Until the U.S. replenishes those stockpiles, the U.S. will not be able
to provide weapons to other countries that might fall victim to Russian,
Chinese Communist Party (CCP), or other invasions]{.underline}. The CCP
and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) are pleased with this situation
because [[the U.S. will neither have the funds **nor**]{.mark} **the
[arms available]{.mark} [to send to Taiwan.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
Second, a CCP-ordered embargo of non-PRC shipping and aircraft flying to
Taiwan restricts U.S. and Asian allies' options for supporting Taiwan. A
nuclear war with China to end a Taiwan embargo is not a politically
feasible policy option. Why would the U.S. and Taiwan's allies not be
able to send weapons or other supplies to Taiwan? Because the CCP will
declare that providing arms or other materials to Taiwan is interfering
in the internal affairs of China. In effect, acts countering the embargo
would be considered casus belli, acts of war. If Russia had been able to
close all of Ukraine's borders, Russia would have made the same
declaration regarding interference in Ukraine. Unfortunately for Russia,
it did not control Ukraine's western borders between Belarus and the
Black Sea, which include the following NATO countries: Poland, Hungary,
Romania, and Slovakia. Through these NATO countries, military and other
aid are flowing into Ukraine. Taiwan is an island and if the PLA Navy
and Air Force control the ocean and the air around Taiwan, then the CCP
could prevent other countries from helping Taiwan during a future
conflict. On May 4, 2022, Admiral Charles Richard, Commander of United
States Strategic Command, noted in his testimony to Congress that the
[[CCP]{.mark} "is [watching]{.mark} the war in [Ukraine]{.mark}
[closely]{.mark} and will likely use nuclear coercion to their advantage
in the future. Their [intent is to]{.mark} **achieve the military
capability to [reunify]{.mark} Taiwan [by 2027]{.mark}**, if not
sooner]{.underline}." [The U.S. and Taiwan's friends and allies should
try to send military aid now and provide training before combat
begins.]{.underline} Providing military aid and training now might be
enough to deter the CCP long enough for Taiwan to become unpalatable for
the CCP to "eat" at least for the short term. The anti-Russia
coalition's war fatigue, lack of supplies, funds, and foresight suggests
Taiwan should prepare to defend itself.

[[Since Russia invaded Ukraine]{.mark} in February, the [Baltic

[and]{.mark} tackling new frontiers in [space]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Since Russia invaded, the U.S. Congress has approved extra funds and the
Pentagon sent F-35 stealth fighters, as well as attack helicopters, to
Estonia; Britain doubled its force presence at Estonia\'s Tapa military
base to around 1,700 personnel. But for many people in the region, which
has been occupied by both Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany and which lies
within striking distance of a Russian garrison at St. Petersburg, that
is not enough. For instance, 84.6% of Latvian respondents to a Benu
Aptiekas/Gemius poll in May said they were highly anxious about
Russia\'s invasion. \"The fact that we could be in danger, it\'s been on
the table all the time,\" said Dzintra Bungs, 82, head of the Latvian
Occupation Museum Association in Riga. \"It is very important that we
have woken up, and that all Europe awakes.\" [The Baltics, with a
combined population of just over six million, want the alliance to boost
its pre-Ukraine invasion presence of around 5,000 multinational soldiers
by as much as tenfold, as well as adding air and maritime
defences.]{.underline} Many of NATO\'s 30 allies in Europe and the
United States support the calls for a bigger force in principle, but in
reality say [allies can only commit to maintaining higher troop levels,
pre-positioning more equipment, weapons and ammunition in the region and
promising rapid reinforcements.]{.underline} The broad outline for
leaders to agree at the summit, the diplomats and NATO officials said,
is a model of larger multinational NATO battlegroups in the Baltics,
with a commitment to quickly reinforce if Russia were about to invade.
Planning for new air and maritime defences will come later. [[Many
members]{.mark}, including Britain and the United States, **[do not
favour permanent new bases]{.mark} in the Baltics**]{.underline}, three
of the diplomats told Reuters. [They said it would cost billions and be

weaponry, [and a permanent]{.mark} [presence would be highly provocative

troops to create a division]{.underline},\" a NATO diplomat said,

Ukraine. [The [Baltic states and Poland are]{.mark} [asking for a
significantly expanded]{.mark} [military presence]{.mark} on their soil
and new capabilities such as antiaircraft defense that could make it far
harder for Russia to invade.]{.underline} [Other [policymakers]{.mark},
**[including from France and Italy]{.mark},** [are voicing skepticism
that the shambolic Russian invasion]{.mark} [force will pose a threat to
NATO territory anytime soon.]{.mark}]{.underline} An initial decision
must be made by the end of June, when NATO leaders will meet at a summit
in Madrid. At that gathering, they are also expected to give initial
approval to Finland and Sweden's membership applications, assuming
Turkey dials back its objections. The expansion would itself
significantly increase NATO's military capability in the eastern part of
the alliance. "Russia's direct military aggression against NATO allies
cannot be excluded," according to a confidential joint proposal from the
Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia that was obtained by The
Washington Post. "Russia can rapidly mass military forces against NATO's
eastern border and confront the Alliance with a short war and fait
accompli," the document said, proposing that a division-size contingent
of about 20,000 troops be tasked with speeding to each of the countries
if they are under threat. [Other [countries are more]{.mark} [cautious
about robust new commitments]{.mark} in Eastern Europe, [wary of signing

This uncomfortable reality for the United States and its allies comes
amid urgent pleas from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to provide
artillery needed to counter Russian forces in the country's east and
south. The Ukrainian leader's appeals are credited with uniting House
lawmakers behind the latest funding request in a bipartisan 368-to-57
vote on Tuesday. But the unprecedented influx of arms has prompted fears
that [some equipment could fall into the hands of Western adversaries or
reemerge in faraway conflicts]{.underline} --- for decades to come.
"It's just impossible to keep track of not only where they're all going
and who is using them, but how they are being used," said Rachel Stohl,
an arms-control expert and vice president at the Stimson Center. A State
Department spokesman said the United States has conducted thorough
vetting of the Ukrainian units it supplies while forcing Kyiv to sign
agreements that "do not allow the retransfer of equipment to third
parties without prior U.S. government authorization." But [the means of
enforcing]{.underline} such [contracts are relatively weak]{.underline}
--- and made even weaker by Washington's own mixed history of
compliance, as recently as last month. In mid-April, the United States
boosted its involvement in the Ukraine conflict by announcing that it
would transfer a fleet of Mi-17 helicopters to Ukraine that it
originally purchased from Russia about a decade ago. The initial sale of
the aircraft required the United States to sign a contract promising not
to transfer the helicopters to any third country "without the approval
of the Russian Federation," according to a copy of the certificate
posted on the website of Russia's Federal Service on Military-Technical
Cooperation. Russia has denounced the transfer, saying it "grossly
violates the foundations of international law." Arms experts say
Russia's brutal aggression in Ukraine more than justifies U.S. support,
but [the **violation of weapons contracts** **chips away at the
foundations** of **counter-proliferation efforts**.]{.underline}
"[Breaking of those end-use agreements is a **serious threat** to
the]{.underline} underlying, but weak, [**capacity for countries to
control how weapons are used**,]{.underline}" said Jeff Abramson, an
expert on conventional arms transfers at the Arms Control Association. A
Pentagon spokesman dismissed the criticisms, calling Russian charges a
distraction and the transfer "permissible under U.S. law and consistent
with our national security priorities." "Russia's claims are a
disingenuous attempt to distract attention from Russia's unprovoked
invasion and its history of aggressive actions against Ukraine since
2014," said Marine Corps Lt. Colonel Anton T. Semelroth. [The job of
ensuring U.S. weapons are used for their intended purpose --- a joint
responsibility of the departments of State and Defense --- is made all
the more difficult by the sheer volume of arms making their way to
Ukraine.]{.underline} The emergency spending bill awaiting approval in
the Senate will cement Ukraine's status as the world's single largest
recipient of U.S. security assistance, receiving more in 2022 than the
United States ever provided to Afghanistan, Iraq or Israel in a single
year. It will add to the stocks of weapons the U.S. already committed to
Ukraine, including 1,400 Stinger antiaircraft systems, 5,500 antitank
missiles, 700 Switchblade drones, 90 long-range Howitzers artillery
systems, 7,000 small arms, 50,000,000 rounds of ammunition, and numerous
other mines, explosives and laser-guided rocket systems. [Shoulder-fired
Stinger missiles, capable of downing commercial airliners, are just one
of the weapon systems experts worry could **slip into the possession of
terrorist groups** seeking to **carry out mass-casualty
events.**]{.underline} The Biden administration's funding request
includes \$8.7 billion to replenish U.S. stores of weapons shipped to
Ukraine, \$6 billion to train and equip Ukrainian forces and \$3.9
billion for U.S. forces deployed throughout Europe in response to the
security crisis that's been set off by the war. Other NATO countries
have transferred billions of dollars in arms and military equipment
since the start of hostilities. "The assistance exceeds the peak year of
U.S. military assistance to Afghan security forces during that 20-year
war," said William Hartung, an arms control expert at the Quincy
Institute think tank. "In that case the U.S. had a major presence
in-country that created at least the possibility of tracking where
weapons were ending up. By comparison, the U.S. government is flying
blind in terms of monitoring weapons supplied to civilian militias and
the military in Ukraine." Ukraine's history as a hub for arms
trafficking dates to the fall of the Soviet Union, when the Soviet
military left behind large amounts of small arms and light weapons in
Ukraine without adequate record-keeping and inventory control. According
to the Small Arms Survey, a Geneva-based research organization, a
portion of the Ukrainian military's 7.1 million small arms in stock in
1992 "were diverted to conflict areas" underscoring "the risk of leakage
to the local black market." The problem grew more acute after Russia's
invasion in 2014, which saw combatants looting arms and munition-storage
facilities of Ukraine's Security Service, Interior and Defense
ministries. "Irregular fighters on both sides progressively gained
access to a wide range of military-grade equipment, including the full
spectrum of small arms and light weapons," according to a report by the
Small Arms Survey in 2017. "Officials estimated that at least 300,000
small arms and light weapons were looted or lost between 2013 and 2015,"
providing a boon the country's black market run by Mafia-style groups in
Donbas region and other criminal networks. [The U.S. government is well
aware of the country's **challenges with weapons proliferation**, though
it has been vague in describing the precautions it's
taking.]{.underline} Weeks after Russia's latest invasion of Ukraine on
Feb. 24, a [group of interagency officials in the Biden administration
met with outside arms-control experts to discuss the **risk of
small-arms proliferation** in the conflict]{.underline}. According to
Stohl, who attended one of the meetings, U.S. officials offered
assurances about vetting Ukrainian security forces and addressing
reports of unauthorized transfer --- but scant details on how the
vetting or monitoring happens. "It does not inspire much confidence,"
said Stohl. Other arms experts feel similarly in the dark. "It is
unclear what risk mitigation or monitoring steps the U.S. and other
countries have taken, or what guarantees they have obtained, to ensure
the protection of civilians through these very large transfers," said
Annie Shiel, a senior adviser at the Center for Civilians in Conflict.
Some of the recommended steps include establishing a special
investigator as the U.S. government did in Afghanistan, ensuring any
weapons transfers contain strong tracking procedures, adding human
rights obligations in the terms of sale and including specifics about
what units can be authorized to receive such transfers. (In 2018,
Congress banned Ukraine's Azov battalion, a far-right nationalist group
associated with neo-Nazism, from receiving U.S. weapons.) [There
are]{.underline} additional [concerns among watchdog groups about **arms
proliferation**]{.underline} [stemming from Moscow amid reports it has
**enlisted mercenaries from Libya, Syria and Chechnya**, as well as the
Wagner Group, a Russian contractor]{.underline}. During a televised
meeting of Russia's Security Council in March, [Defense Minister Sergei
Shoigu said **16,000 volunteers in the Middle East** stood ready to
fight alongside Russian-backed forces in Eastern Ukraine.]{.underline}
In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin offered his approval,
saying, "We need to give them what they want and help them get to the
conflict zone." At the same meeting, [Shoigu proposed **handing over
captured U.S. Javelin and Stinger missiles** to pro-Russian separatists
in Donbas region]{.underline}. "Please do this," Putin told Shoigu. [The
**introduction of foreign fighters** to a conflict runs the **risks of
weapons returning to** those **individuals' countries of origin** when
the fighting in Ukraine ends]{.underline}. There are conflicting reports
about the presence of foreign fighters there, however, and it's unclear
precisely how many have in fact traveled to Ukraine. The lack of
information has spurred calls for answers from the administration and
attention from Congress. "Some of the weapons being provided in the
conflict in Ukraine are likely to be found years, and possibly decades
later," said Abramson. "Congressional leaders should be asking these
questions, in classified briefings if needed, and the public should be
better informed."

and Libya"; Friedrich Ebert Stiftung; MENA Peace & Security Project;
October 2020; https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/iez/16657.pdf\]//eleanor

This policy paper aims to explore the new **[flows and trade of illicit
arms across the MENA region]{.underline}** that have created and
**[continue to feed ongoing conflicts,]{.underline}** most notably **[in
Libya, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen]{.underline}**. [This situation threatens
the human and **national security of the region's nations**. Combatting
war economy activities in war-ridden countries will be a critical issue
in the post-conflict context, and this pertains to countering small arms
and light weaponry transfers that may reignite conflicts on both
communal and ethnic levels]{.underline}. Examining illicit arms
transfers in Libya and Yemen, the paper draws policy options that
address the economic, social, and political aspects of this threat.
Consequently, it will investigate the existing international legal
framework and mechanisms employed by regional and international
organizations such as the African Union (AU) and the UN, as well as how
to fill the gap between them and the national authorities in charge of
stemming out this threat. MAPPING OUT CONFLICT AND ARMS TRAFFICKING IN
THE MENA REGION Legal arms and weaponry owned by the state and law
enforcement are essential to peace and stability. **[Illicit arms
transfer is key to enduring conflicts, social strife, and crime, notably
terrorism]{.underline}**. [Illicit arms transfer or arms trafficking can
be defined as those arms and weaponry possessed, stored, traded, and
used in clear violation of national and/or international laws and
without official government consent or control]{.underline}; these
transfers may involve corrupt government officials acting on their own
for personal gain (see Small Arms Survey definitions). Basically,
non-state actors, whether they are terrorist organizations, militias, or
criminal gangs, are the most relevant to the illicit arms transfer;
nevertheless, states are major players in this trade since they are the
main manufacturers and suppliers of illicit arms. For example, while the
arms trafficking black market is dominated by criminal and trafficker
groups, the illicit grey market arms transfer refers to deals done by
governments, or their clients and agents, exploiting loopholes or
intentionally circumventing national and international laws governing
arms trade. [By applying this understanding to illicit arms trade in the
MENA region, this paper tends to focus on the implications of the arms
proliferation of small arms and light weaponry (SALW) that refer to
heavy machine-guns; hand-held under-barrel and mounted grenade
launchers; portable anti-aircraft guns; portable anti-tank guns;
recoilless rifles; portable launchers of anti-tank missiles and rocket
systems, etc]{.underline}. Therefore, proliferation in this regard does
not include the use of non-conventional arms such as nuclear, chemical,
and biological weapons, which are subject to a different
non-proliferation set of policies. In the MENA region, **[illicit arms
transfer is]{.underline}** both **[a cause]{.underline}** and effect
**[of the unfolding armed conflicts that continue to rage
on.]{.underline}** While arms trafficking had been always around the
corner before the Arab Uprisings in 2011, and mostly related to the
state-softness and the states' clientelist political structure, the
[disintegration of the Arab states in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Libya gave
rise to illicit arms trafficking and other criminal
activities]{.underline}. Moreover, [the rise of violent non-state actors
and their trans-border networks, and the intensification of the regional
geopolitical rivalries, namely between Russia, Turkey, Iran, Saudi
Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt in addition to the EU and USA, turned the
conflict into prolonged proxy wars]{.underline} where local and national
warring parties are provided with arms and funds to gain political
ground. Setting aside direct military intervention by some of these
powers in the conflicts of the four war-ridden countries, these
interventions were in violation of the UN-imposed embargo designed to
disarm the national conflict parties, be it national parties such as the
Government of National Accord (GNA) and Libyan National Army (LNA) in
Libya, the Assad Regime in Syria, or terrorist groups such as ISIS and
Al Qaeda across the region. On the other hand, the **[proliferation of
arms]{.underline}**, especially SALW, **[is perpetuating
conflicts]{.underline}** in many ways. [It **sustains the power
balance** between conflicting parties; and it **entrenches war economy
activities**, such as human trafficking, drugs, and goods allowing
**local criminal organizations** to become **armed to the
teeth**.]{.underline} Additionally[, it **deteriorates social
stability** since it **fuels communal and social strife**, especially in
sectarian, tribal, or ethnic conflicts, which is an **underlying cause
for most of the Arab civil wars.**]{.underline} [For these
socio-economic and political reasons, disarmament and arms control is
integral to post-conflict stabilization and regional
security]{.underline}.

#### That cauess Israel-Iran escalation -- goes nuclear. 

**Teller 22** \[Neville Teller has written about the Middle East for
more than 30 years, has published five books on the subject;

[Of the many conflicts in the Middle East, the ongoing proxy war between
Iran and Israel is potentially the most explosive.]{.underline} Built
into the DNA of the Iranian Revolution from its start in 1979 was the
aim of destroying Israel, as a preliminary step toward the destruction
of Western democracy as exemplified by the US. In pursuit of this
fundamental objective, [Iran's leaders have provided funding, weapons,
and training to groups including Lebanese Hezbollah, Hamas, and
Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)) which have carried out attacks on
Israel, and which have been designated terrorist organizations by many
countries, Because Israel perceives the Iranian regime as a threat to
its very existence, it has consistently opposed Iran's nuclear weapon
and missile programs. It seeks also to downgrade Iran's allies and
proxies, and prevent Iranian entrenchment in Syria, another sworn enemy
of Israel. For years, Iran and Israel have engaged in a shadow war,
quietly attacking each other --directly or by proxy -- on land, by air
and at sea. Escalation to all-out war has been deliberately avoided, and
attacks usually remain either unattributed or plausibly
denied]{.underline}. For example, the assassination of five Iranian
nuclear scientists between 2010 and 2020 remains unexplained and
unacknowledged, to say nothing of the series of mysterious explosions at
various of Iran's nuclear facilities in 2020. In April 2021, [Iran
blamed Israel and vowed revenge for an explosion at its largest uranium
enrichment facility in Natanz, which it said caused significant damage
to its centrifuges.]{.underline} It was the second time in less than a
year that the site had been hit by a suspicious blast. Israel neither
confirmed nor denied it was responsible for either attack. A cyber
attack that paralyzed Iran's gas stations nationwide on October 26,
2021, has also not been acknowledged. [Backed heavily by Iran's Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hezbollah's military forces in Lebanon have,
if the boasts of its leaders are to be believed, accrued a vast arsenal
of rockets and missiles along the border. Israeli forces have repeatedly
struck at Hezbollah's rocket pipeline within Lebanon, and Hezbollah has
on occasion retaliated by firing rockets into Israel and attacking
Israeli troops along the border. As for Syria, ever since the civil
conflict started]{.underline} in 2011 [Iran has been strengthening its
military presence]{.underline} in the country in support of Assad. Using
its so-called "Shia Crescent" Iran transfers weaponry meant for
Hezbollah through Iraq and Syria. In an effort to stop the arms flow and
counter this second hostile presence on its northern border, [Israel has
conducted an increasingly open campaign of air strikes in Syria against
the flow of weaponry and its storage.]{.underline} At sea, tit-for-tat
attacks on commercial vessels in and around the Gulf of Hormuz began in
2019 -- again with little by way of explanation for each incident. Since
several targets have been Iranian tankers carrying oil towards Syria,
media and the public have been left free to speculate. **[There is
always a risk of this long-standing proxy war suddenly igniting into
direct military conflict between Israel and Iran]{.underline}**. Whether
this nightmare scenario ever materializes turns on how Iran's nuclear
program emerges from the current negotiations in Vienna around reviving
the nuclear deal. The administration of President Joe Biden seems dead
set on concluding a new agreement which, all reports indicate, would
delay but not eliminate Iran's eventual acquisition of a nuclear
military capability. Iran's leaders say they have no ambition to build
nuclear weapons. The hoard of secret documents spirited out of Iran in
2018 suggests otherwise. In Washington on October 20, 2021 foreign
minister Yair Lapid warned that Israel was prepared to use military
force to stop Iran from gaining nuclear weapons capability. "Iran has
publicly stated it wants to wipe us out," said Lapid. "We have no
intention of letting this happen." [Should force be required to stop an
Iranian bomb, Israel would have to act, and almost certainly act alone.
That is how the long-standing **Israel-Iran proxy war could assume a
terrible reality**.]{.underline}

[Western [countries]{.mark} have been [ramping up weapons and ammunition
shipments]{.mark} [to Ukraine as Kyiv fights off a Russian
invasion]{.mark}, but arms trade experts warn [some of the lethal
assistance **could end up falling into the wrong
hands.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Ukraine in particular has a history as a
hub of the arms trade during the 1990s, setting off alarm bells for
those who study illicit flows. \"[There are very significant risks
associated to the proliferation of weapons in Ukraine at the moment, in
particular regarding small arms and light weapons]{.underline},\" said
Nils Duquet, a researcher and director of the Flemish Peace Institute.
Western nations, above all the US, have announced successive shipments
of both light and heavy weapons for Kyiv\'s forces since Russian troops
crossed the Ukrainian border on February 24. [Washington alone has
delivered or promised military gear including hundreds of Switchblade
kamikaze drones, 7,000 assault rifles with 50 million rounds of
ammunition, laser-guided missiles and radar systems to detect enemy
drones and incoming artillery fire.]{.underline} \"While the response to
provide more weapons to Ukraine is understandable\..., it would be
prudent to consider the immediate and long-term security implications,\"
the US-based Stimson Center think-tank said in March. \"We've seen time
and time again how [[arms aimed at aiding an ally]{.mark} in one
conflict [have found their way to the frontlines of unforeseen]{.mark}
[battlefields]{.mark}, **often [in the hands of groups at odds with US
interests]{.mark} or those of civilians**]{.underline},\" it added,
pointing especially to small arms. \'Overwhelming challenge\' Following
the collapse of the Soviet Union, many weapons stockpiled in Ukraine
were shipped off to other countries and conflict zones around the world.
That looting of the country\'s arms supplies resumed following Russia\'s
2014 annexation of the Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and the
seizure of two regions in the east of Ukraine by pro-Moscow separatists.
[[According to the]{.mark} Small Arms Survey ([SAS]{.mark}) by the
Geneva-based Institute of International and Development Studies,
[300,000 light]{.mark} [weapons were stolen or lost]{.mark} between 2013
and 2015, with just 4,000 retrieved since then.]{.underline} Rather than
being shipped abroad as in the 1990s, most of these ended up on the
black market within Ukraine, the SAS found. \"The unresolved conflict in
the eastern part of the country and general anxiety towards local
security conditions\" could explain increased demand for weapons among
ordinary people, SAS researcher Matt Schroeder said. Looking ahead,
\"[collecting these weapons and disposing of them properly would be an
overwhelming challenge for any government, let alone one that is still
fighting an existential threat,]{.underline}\" he added. \'Bank
robberies with Javelins\' Even before the current conflict, the US
military\'s inspector general in 2020 questioned the level of
surveillance of weapons sent to Ukraine. Annie Shiel of the Center for
Civilians in Conflict (Civic) warned that \"[there has been very little
transparency around what risk mitigation or monitoring steps the US and
other countries sending weapons to Ukraine have taken, if any\... to
ensure the protection of civilians]{.underline}\". The aid group has
called for deliveries to be tied to human rights commitments and for the
arms to be tracked after they are handed over. Other experts see the
task of following arms through conflict zones as all but impossible.
[\"It\'s an illusion to think that in a context of war you can actually
have control of weapons there. We know that [many weapons will
not]{.mark} [return to the official forces but]{.mark} **they [will
remain in the region for many years]{.mark}**]{.underline}**,\"** said
Nils Duquet. \"Look at Yugoslavia, success has been made but these
weapons are still being smuggled in all parts of Europe,\" he added,
predicting similar outcomes for Ukraine. One senior French military
officer evoked a lurid possible outcome. \"We\'ll be laughing on the
other side of our faces once we\'re seeing bank robberies with
Javelins,\" he said, referring to the US-made anti-tank missiles.

[The [US has few ways to track the]{.mark} substantial [supply of
anti-tank]{.mark}, [anti-aircraft and other weaponry it has sent across
the border]{.mark} into Ukraine]{.underline}, sources tell CNN, a blind
spot that's due in large part to the lack of US boots on the ground in
the country -- and the easy portability of many of the smaller systems
now pouring across the border. It's a conscious risk the Biden
administration is willing to take. In the short term, the US sees the
transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of equipment to be
vital to the Ukrainians' ability to hold off Moscow's invasion. A senior
defense official said Tuesday that it is "certainly the largest recent
supply to a partner country in a conflict." [But the risk, both current
US officials and defense analysts say, is that in the long term, **[some
of those weapons may]{.mark} [wind up in]{.mark} the hands of [other
militaries and militias]{.mark} that the US did not intend to
arm.**]{.underline} "We have fidelity for a short time, but when it
enters the fog of war, we have almost zero," said one source briefed on
US intelligence. "[It drops into a big black hole, and [you have]{.mark}
**almost [no sense of it]{.mark} at all [after a short period of]{.mark}
[time]{.mark}."**]{.underline} In making the decision to send billions
of dollars of weapons and equipment into Ukraine, the Biden
administration factored in the risk that some of the shipments may
ultimately end up in unexpected places, a defense official said. But
right now, the official said, the administration views a failure to
adequately arm Ukraine as a greater risk. Because the US military is not
on the ground, [the US and NATO are heavily reliant on information
provided by Ukraine's government. Privately, officials recognize that
Ukraine has an incentive to give only information that will bolster
their case for more aid, more arms and more diplomatic
assistance.]{.underline} "It's a war -- everything they do and say
publicly is designed to help them win the war. Every public statement is
an information operation, every interview, every Zelensky appearance
broadcast is an information operation," said another source familiar
with western intelligence. "It doesn't mean they're wrong to do it in
any way." For months, US and western officials have offered detailed
accounts about what the West knows about the status of Russian forces
inside Ukraine: how many casualties they've taken, their remaining
combat power, their weapons stocks, what kinds of munitions they are
using and where. But when it comes to Ukrainian forces, officials
acknowledge that the West -- including the US -- has some information
gaps. Western estimates of Ukrainian casualties are also foggy,
according to two sources familiar with US and western intelligence.
["[It's hard to track with nobody on the ground]{.mark}," said one
source familiar with the intelligence.]{.underline}

by the Defense Department are picked up by Ukrainian armed forces --
primarily in Poland -- and then driven into Ukraine, Kirby said, "then

But [these stories overlook the [danger]{.mark} or risk of illegal
diversion [that comes with issuing weapons with little to no
oversight]{.mark}, something that the **Ukrainian government does not
seem to realize**]{.underline}, despite the fact that the diversion of
military-grade weapons such as hand grenades, rockets, and landmines has
been a profitable business in Ukraine in recent years, giving the
country a very bad name in the process. A Hub Of Illicit Arms According
to the Global Organized Crime Index, apart from being a source of
transit and destination point for human trafficking, [[Ukraine]{.mark}
[is one of the]{.mark} **[largest arms trafficking markets]{.mark},**
with a substantial stockpile of weapons, few barriers to accessing arms
and millions of small arms and light weapons on the black
market.]{.underline} "While it has long been a key link in the global
arms trade, [[its role has only intensified]{.mark} [since the beginning
of the conflict]{.mark} in eastern Ukraine. Most arms are reportedly
trafficked domestically, but the [illicit arms trade is]{.mark} also
[linked to **criminal arms markets**]{.mark} **in Russia, Belarus,
Moldova, Georgia, and Turkey,** as well as countries in the EU and the
former Yugoslavia,"]{.underline} the index points out. "Within Ukraine,
the cities of Odesa, Dnipro, Kharkiv, and Kyiv are significant
logistical centers for criminal networks. [The [increasing number of
arms]{.mark} [combined with]{.mark} relatively [limited controls and
conflict in]{.mark} parts of eastern Ukraine [has resulted in a sharp
increase in the size of the criminal market]{.mark} for small arms and
light weapons, particularly Makarov and Tokarev pistols, AK-pattern
assault rifles, and Dragunov sniper rifles.]{.underline} "Additionally,
there is a smaller market for light machine guns. Firearm seizures have
been the largest in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where fighting has
been the most intense. Conflict-affected areas constitute the major
sources of illicit flows for the rest of the country."

[The White House announced a new military aid package of \$800 million

Ukrainians in the use of these systems, and implicitly assumes a long

#### The United States federal government should condition incremental sanctions relief and military aid to Ukraine on Russian agreement to end military engagement in Ukraine.

#### The CP gives Russia a way out AND solves the Ukraine war

[Russia may also be incentivized to enter negotiations if it receives a
pledge that incremental sanctions relief will follow its implementation
of a negotiated peace deal with Ukraine]{.underline}. Another card that
can be played by the West is NATO expansion into Sweden and Finland. The
process of the two countries joining NATO has been stalled by Turkey's
opposition. Bringing Sweden and Finland into the alliance may have its
pros and cons for the United States and its allies. On the one hand,
adding two strong member states could strengthen the alliance. On the
other hand, it will extend U.S. and allied commitments in Europe at a
time when a bigger strategic challenge in Asia requires more resources
and attention. But this issue aside, it would be hard to dispute that
ending the war in Ukraine is not more important than Sweden and Finland
joining NATO. Russia has long opposed Sweden and Finland's membership in
NATO and will likely be willing to make concessions on Ukraine if their
bid to join NATO seems imminent. [Turkey may be willing to play nice if
the resolution on the table could end the Ukraine war. After angering
Russia by supplying effective Bayraktar TB-2 drones to Ukraine, Turkey
returned to its policy of balancing between the West and Russia as soon
as it became apparent that Ukraine is unlikely to fall]{.underline}.
Turkey's opposition to Sweden and Finland's NATO bids should be seen
primarily in this context. Inflation in Turkey recently hit a
twenty-three-year high of 73.5 percent, and the war in Ukraine is doing
even more harm to the Turkish economy. A recent survey shows that public
support for the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has fallen to
26.5 percent, a near-historic low. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will
certainly welcome a boost to the Turkish economy, especially given next
year's presidential and parliamentary elections.

### 2NC - Solvency

#### Sanctions are key to effective negotiation

**Treisman 22** - a writer and editor for the Morning Edition live blog,
which she helped launch in early 2021 (Rachel, "How sanctions factor

The U.S. and other western allies have unleashed a barrage of economic
penalties on Russia in the weeks since it first invaded Ukraine. As the
violence continues --- and the two countries return to the negotiating
table --- how much are sanctions actually helping push Russia to end the
war? Morning Edition\'s A Martínez posed that question to Juan Zarate, a
former assistant secretary of the Treasury who is now global co-managing
partner at K2 Integrity. Zarate says the [[sanctions]{.mark} have [had a
dramatic impact on the Russian economy]{.mark} when it comes to things
like the value of the ruble and the selloff of bonds and
assets]{.underline}, but are not enough on their own to turn back the
tanks, especially when there\'s \"a committed actor like \[Russian
President Vladimir Putin\] with a design on invading a country and
potentially destroying its cities. \"Sanctions have a tail to them ---
they take time to take effect, the effects on the economy in Russia are
still just being felt, and so I think it\'s asking sanctions to do too
much to actually stop the war. But [it certainly can be part of a
tableau of pressure that\'s put on Putin to try to change his behavior,
change his calculus,]{.underline}\" Zarate explains, pointing to other
factors like the Ukrainian resistance, diplomatic isolation and
companies pulling out of Russia. [[Sanctions]{.mark} can, however,
**[play an important role in the]{.mark} ongoing [negotiations between
Russia and Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.** And Zarate says we may
also see more action taken against sanctions evaders, and countries that
are continuing to do business with Russia. [How sanctions factor into
negotiations]{.underline} Zarate says [sanctions could play two
important roles in the ongoing peace talks. For one, [they]{.mark} help
[shape how Russia]{.mark} [feels the costs of its]{.mark}
[actions]{.mark}]{.underline}, something he says should play into the
calculus of negotiators at the bargaining table. In other words, he
says, they should understand that [things are only going to get worse
for Russia as its economy continues to feel the effects of sanctions.
The [conversation]{.mark} [could also]{.mark} come to **[include the
lifting of certain sanctions]{.mark},** such as restrictions on trade or
investment. \"Every sanction that is used as a stick can also be used as
a carrot,\"]{.underline} Zarate says, adding that he has seen this in
the case of Iran and other countries that are seeking to get out from
under the pressure of economic sanctions.

#### Sanctions are key to force Russia to the negotiating table BUT continued arms collapses negotiations

"It's not that I want to talk to Putin," Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky said last week about Russia's president. "[I need to talk to
Putin. The world needs to talk to Putin. **There is no other way to stop
this war.**]{.underline}**"** The United States should heed this plea.
Ukraine's resistance to Russia's unprovoked and illegal invasion has
been both heroic and effective, but its situation is precarious. For all
their flaws, [Russia's armed forces may yet prevail in a prolonged
conflict, and there is still a real danger that much of Ukraine will
become a Russian vassal state under a puppet government]{.underline}.
Moreover, even if Ukraine can hold off Russian forces indefinitely, the
prospect of forcibly evicting them from its territory---particularly in
the south---is daunting. All the while, Russia is slaughtering Ukraine's
citizens ever more indiscriminately. But as Zelensky's statement
suggests, Ukraine's plan to end this war is probably not to vanquish the
invading forces. Rather, its goal appears to be to make the prospect of
continuing the war, and the occupation that could follow it,
exceptionally painful for Russia---so painful that Putin comes to view a
settlement agreement that preserves Ukraine's independence as the lesser
of two evils. Putin may already be feeling the pain. The United States
believes that Putin embarked on this war seeking to conquer most or all
of Ukraine. Today, Moscow has implicitly recognized Zelensky's
government by demanding, in return for an end to the war, that Kyiv
agree to Ukrainian neutrality, acknowledge Crimea as Russian territory,
and recognize Donetsk and Lugansk as independent states. If Ukrainian
forces continue to perform well, Putin will have to settle for still
less and may even have to pay Ukraine reparations. (Conversely, if
Russian forces achieve breakthroughs, Putin will be able to drive a
harder bargain.) Even in the best case[, [if Zelensky wants a negotiated
settlement]{.mark}, [he will]{.mark} likely [have to make significant
concessions]{.mark} to Russia---as he has acknowledged.]{.underline} Any
such concessions will probably be bitterly opposed by many in the United
States and Europe. Ultimately, though, it is not their call. The
democratically elected government of Ukraine should get to decide what
price it is willing to pay for an end to the slaughter of its citizens
and the preservation of Ukraine's existence as a sovereign state. [The
United States and its allies should support Zelensky in any diplomatic
course he pursues. Indeed, he cannot end the war without them. [Economic
sanctions]{.mark} on Russia **[strengthen]{.mark} [his hand at the
negotiating table]{.mark}** [by raising the costs]{.mark} to Russia of
continuing to fight.]{.underline} By the same token, however, [it is
virtually [inconceivable]{.mark} [that Russia would agree to a
settlement without sanctions relief]{.mark}]{.underline}. For this
reason, [the United States and its allies must be prepared to lift
sanctions]{.underline}---including on Russia's central bank---if Russia
and Ukraine negotiate and implement a settlement agreement. To date, the
United States and its allies have sent out mixed messages about
sanctions relief. U.S. Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland
indicated an openness to it. By contrast, French Finance Minister Bruno
Le Maire has declared "economic and financial war on Russia" with the
goal of causing "the collapse of the Russian economy." In a similar
vein, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss stated that "the purpose
of the sanctions is to debilitate the Russian economy." [This ambiguity
is dangerous because it risks obscuring the existence of an off-ramp for
Putin and could thus prolong the conflict and increase the small but
real chance of nuclear escalation.]{.underline} U.S. President Joe
[[Biden]{.mark} [should]{.mark} clear up the confusion by
**[stat]{.mark}ing [publicly]{.mark} that [the purpose of sanctions is
to end the war]{.mark}**, not to remove the government of
Russia.]{.underline} In coordination with Kyiv, he should dispatch a
trusted lieutenant---such as Secretary of State Antony Blinken or CIA
Director William Burns---to try to negotiate with Russia. [Washington
and its allies could also explore whether they could [address]{.mark}
[Russian security concerns]{.mark}, and vice versa, [through]{.mark} the
**implementation of reciprocal [arms control
measures]{.mark}**]{.underline}---as the United States and NATO proposed
in January. Success in this endeavor would be far from guaranteed, and
the Biden administration would take heat for even trying. This
criticism, however, could be undercut by Zelensky's stating publicly
that he would support sanctions relief for Russia in return for the
implementation of any agreement he negotiated.

an unthinkable horror and focusing on steps to ensure that it never,
ever happens, Romney thinks we should be making plans, and simply
reassures us that things definitely won't end in catastrophe, even
though we would be depending on the (clearly delusional and violent)
Vladimir Putin to act with caution and restraint[. [There is no
need]{.mark} [for a U.S.-Russia war to happen]{.mark}, but if one does

not be published in mainstream newspapers.

## Lashout Turn

#### Either side could win the war now BUT it'll be [close]{.underline} -- the aff ensures a [crushing defeat]{.underline} for Russia which spurs Putin lashout

Accessed 6-25-22, LASA-AH)

[Calls that nothing short of a "true defeat" be visited on Russian
President Vladimir Putin's are growing in both frequency and
intensit]{.underline}y. And nowhere is this on more prominent display
than in Anne Applebaum's recent Atlantic piece calling for a victory
over Russia that is rapid, comprehensive (involving military defeat,
economic pain and even some type of NATO membership for Ukraine) and,
above all, humiliating. [According to Applebaum, [only]{.mark} such
[a]{.mark} profound and [profoundly humiliating defeat will permanently
chasten Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. Only such a true defeat will "force
the reckoning that should have happened in the 1990s.... the moment when
Russians should have realized the folly of Moscow's imperial overreach,
when they should have figured out why so many of their neighbors hate
and fear them." [Only such a true defeat, she avers, will end the
historical pattern of Russian aggression and bring about permanent peace
on its periphery. But while it might be emotionally gratifying to issue
such calls, and even to fantasize about inflicting terrible pain on such
obvious malefactors, the goal of inflicting such a defeat on Russia
**must not become allowed to become policy**]{.underline}. For if
history teaches us anything relevant to the current conflict, it is that
[inflicting such a defeat would most definitely not have the salutary
effect on international security that its advocates assume.]{.underline}
Indeed, quite the opposite[. [Inflicting a]{.mark} comprehensive and
[humiliating defeat]{.mark} on Russia [would be **far more likely to set
the stage for further discord**]{.mark}, conflict and war on Europe's
eastern marches than to usher in an era of regional peace and
tranquility]{.underline}. To put it bluntly, indulging fantasies of
inflicting near-total defeat on Russia would be a terrible mistake ---
one that we can, and must, avoid making. To understand why [inflicting a
devastating defeat on Russia would be such a terrible
mistake,]{.underline} it is necessary to pay attention to a motivating
factor that is often overlooked or minimized in conventional accounts of
foreign policy and grand strategy: **[humiliation]{.underline}**. [[Most
theories]{.mark} of international relations, of course, tend to [assume
rational actors]{.mark}]{.underline}, either anthropomorphized states or
actual state officials seeking to rationally advance or defend the
state's national interest. While not entirely blind to "non-rational"
factors in individual or collective decisionmaking, [[these
approaches]{.mark} [tend to]{.mark} systematically **[downplay]{.mark}
or ignore [the]{.mark} [role of emotion]{.mark}** in shaping the foreign
policies of states.]{.underline} But, as Clausewitz cautioned us long
ago, emotions in general (or the passions, as he called them) can and do
play an important role in foreign policy, especially when it comes to
war. And as Joslyn Barnhart argues in her recent book "The Consequences
of Humiliation: Anger and Status in World Politics," historically, the
specific emotion of "humiliation" has proven to be a major driver of
foreign policy -- especially the kind of revanchist and revisionist
foreign policy that all too often leads to war. Barnhart's compelling
argument begins with a definition: Humiliation "is a complex and
negative self-conscious emotion, which combines the sense that one has
been mistreated with a painful sense of self-doubt and helplessness in
the face of this injustice." It is the substrate for "national
humiliation," which "arises when individuals who identify as members of
the state experience humiliation as the overwhelming emotional response
to an international event." [National humiliation occurs, Barnhart
further argues, either when a state suffers "rapid defeat to a state
with lesser military capability" or when it has "been unfairly
undermined by ill-intended others]{.underline}." Either way, such
humiliation involves a "loss of status or prestige which they \[policy
makers\] believe has undeservedly threatened the state's image on the
world stage." Finally, Barnhart shows how [[humiliated states]{.mark}
[have]{.mark} historically [attempted to overcome their
humiliation]{.mark} and restore their status and prestige [by engaging
in "the use of force]{.mark} against the state responsible for one's
humiliation or [against third-party states]{.mark} that were not
involved in the original humiliating event."]{.underline} Although
Barnhart's book was published before Russia reinvaded Ukraine earlier
this year, its implications for today's Russo-Ukraine war are perhaps
obvious. Indeed, it doesn't take much imagination to see how
[[inflicting a devastating defeat on Russia]{.mark} of the kind
Applebaum advocates [would]{.mark} both [humiliate]{.mark} the country's
[leaders]{.mark} [and incentivize them to]{.mark} take whatever steps
they deem necessary -- **up to and including [start]{.mark}ing [another
war]{.mark}** -- to overcome this humiliation.]{.underline} The
strategic implications of this are perhaps obvious. As Barnhart notes in
her conclusion, [prudent policy that seeks to minimize both the
humiliation of defeated states and all of the undesirable consequences
of such humiliation should "avoid the codification of inferiority within
formal and informal treaties and negotiations."]{.underline} They should
avoid, in other words, imposing punitive treaties and settlements that
formalize inferiority or that seek to diminish the defeated nation's
status or standing beyond some unavoidable minimum. In the absence of a
1945-scale total victory by one side or the other (which is obviously
not in the cards), this suggests that the [[goal now should be a
**negotiated settlement**]{.mark} that leaves both Russia and Ukraine
(a) exhausted, (b) relatively satisfied and (c) as little humiliated as
possible.]{.underline}

Senior White House officials designing the strategy to confront Russia

[[concerns accelerated after]{.mark} Mr. [Putin's order]{.mark} on

state of readiness.)

### 1NC - Russia Loss Bad

#### Russian loss in Ukraine causes [nuclear lash out]{.underline} AND an emboldened China

America and a Visiting Fellow at the German Marshall Fund (Liana and

[The [consequence]{.mark}s [of a Russian loss]{.mark} in Ukraine would
present Europe and the United States with fundamental challenges.
Assuming Russia will be forced to withdraw one day, rebuilding Ukraine,
with the political goal of welcoming it into the EU and NATO, will be a
task of Herculean proportions]{.underline}. And the West must not fail
Ukraine again. Alternatively, a weak form of Russian control over
Ukraine could mean a fractured, destabilized area of continuous fighting
with limited or no governance structures just east of NATO's border. The
humanitarian catastrophe would be unlike anything Europe has seen in
decades. [No less worrisome is [the prospect of a **weakened and
humiliated Russia**]{.mark}, [harboring revanchist impulses]{.mark} akin
to those that festered in Germany after World War I.]{.underline} If
Putin maintains his grip on power, [[Russia will become a pariah
state]{.mark}, [a rogue superpower]{.mark} with a chastened conventional
military but [with]{.mark} [its nuclear]{.mark} [arsenal
intact]{.mark}.]{.underline} The guilt and stain of the Ukraine war will
stay with Russian politics for decades; rare is the country that profits
from a lost war. The futility of the costs spent on a lost war, the
human toll, and the geopolitical decline will define the course of
Russia and Russian foreign policy for many years to come, and it will be
very difficult to imagine a liberal Russia emerging after the horrors of
this war. [Even [if Putin loses his grip on Russia]{.mark}, the country
is unlikely to emerge as a pro-Western democracy. It could split apart,
especially in the North Caucasus. Or [it could become a **nuclear-armed
military dictatorship**]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}** Policymakers
would not be wrong to hope for a better Russia and for the time when a
post-Putin Russia could be genuinely integrated into Europe; they should
do what they can to enable this eventuality, even as they resist Putin's
war. They would be foolish, however, not to prepare for darker
possibilities. History has shown that [it is [immensely difficult to
build a stable international order with a revanchist]{.mark}, humiliated
[power near its center]{.mark}, especially one of the size and weight of
Russia.]{.underline} To do so, the West would have to adopt an approach
of continuous isolation and containment. Keeping Russia down and the
United States in would become the priority for Europe in such a
scenario, as Europe will have to bear the main burden of managing an
isolated Russia after a lost war in Ukraine; Washington, for its part,
would want to finally focus on China. [[China]{.mark}, in turn, [could
try to strengthen its influence over a weakened
Russia]{.mark}---[leading]{.mark} [to]{.mark} exactly [the]{.mark} kind
of bloc-building and [Chinese dominance the West wanted to
prevent]{.mark} at the beginning of the 2020s]{.underline}.

#### Even a small Ukrainian victory guarantees nuclear response

LASA-AH)

Another risk is that [even a small Ukrainian victory might be **preceded
or followed by nuclear threats from Putin**]{.underline}. [Putin has
departed from Cold War precedent by instrumentalizing nuclear weapons
for political reasons rather than just for ones related to national
security]{.underline}. His menacing statements have come across as
bluster. But Putin could up the ante. [To scare his adversaries, he
could order technical preparations for the **potential use of nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}. The West should react to such threats with
deterrence, signaling clearly that Putin would achieve nothing through
the use of nuclear weapons. If that does not work, and Putin acts on his
threats, then NATO should consider carrying out a limited conventional
response, either against Russian forces in Ukraine or within Russia
itself. In the meantime, the West needs to build a broad coalition to
condemn and deter nuclear saber rattling by linking sanctions and
threats of retaliation to Putin's nuclear brinkmanship. China might not
join in, but out of fear of nuclear instability, it might approve of the
idea. Finally, [even if Ukraine wins small, Kyiv and its partners would
have to prepare for years of continued conflict.]{.underline} Zelensky
has indicated as much by saying that postwar Ukraine will resemble
Israel in its full-time orientation toward self-defense.
[Putin]{.underline}, meanwhile, [would continue to probe for Western
vulnerabilities: much as he responded to Western sanctions in 2014 by
meddling in the U.S. presidential election in 2016]{.underline}, he
would likely mix cyberattacks, disinformation, and "active measures,"
such as operations that would damage political parties and leaders
Russia dislikes, undermine the internal stability of "anti-Russian"
countries, and degrade the integrity of the transatlantic alliance and
similar such alliances in the Indo-Pacific. The West would be forced to
contain Russia for the foreseeable future. After all, the West can do
little to influence Russia from within other than to hope for the
emergence of less combative Russian leadership.

**[[Beware the Cornered]{.mark} [Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}** Many
people and organizations, from cereal companies to Hogwarts houses, have

Pizza Rat, which is just trying to bring dinner home on the subway, or
Scabby the Rat, which is just trying to helpfully point out non-union

more pressure on Putin to respond.]{.underline} More sanctions would
then follow, including disconnecting all of Russia's banks and financial
institutions from SWIFT, including entities tied to Russian energy, the

ability to exist, would be threatened. [The Putin regime would be

Defusing a Russian intervention and getting out of this crisis implies
pressuring Ukraine to implement the constitutional reforms necessary to
grant autonomy and amnesty to the Donbas republics. These separatist
republics have significant support from the local population and are
backed by a major power. They have thousands of civil servants,
especially soldiers, who are more determined to fight -- and die -- than
NATO. [Ultimately, the main driver of Russian-Western tensions is
Ukraine. Kyiv's desire to join NATO is in direct opposition to Russia's
conception of national and territorial security.]{.underline} Russia is
ready to fight to secure its interests, as are the Ukrainians. However,
[Ukrainians have no real chance of winning against Russia without
Western support. The Atlantic Alliance **lacks the cohesion and interest
to pay the costs associated with real support for
Ukraine**]{.underline}. [The current half-support is insufficient to
deter Russia, and it even **encourages a Russian intervention to stop
Ukraine's steady military modernization.**]{.underline} To truly deter
Russia, NATO would have to provide assets and endure costs that its
members do not want to bear. This is why implementing a strategy that
corresponds to NATO's accurate means and interests would help to avoid
crisis escalation. And such strategy entails [convincing Moscow that a
legal way out exists in the Donbas by reorienting Western pressure from
Moscow to Kyiv.]{.underline}

#### US military support causes Russian insecurity -- prompts lashout

Western Support to Ukraine [Russian current tenseness is in direct
reaction to continuous Western support of Ukraine forces]{.underline}
fighting Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions
-- collectively known as the Donbas. NATO's support to Kyiv is channeled
through the Comprehensive Assistance Package for Ukraine. Since 2014 and
the Russian annexation of Crimea and destabilization in Eastern Ukraine,
NATO's goal has been to increase capacity building and provide military
training to allow Ukrainian forces to resist Russian-backed militias in
the Donbas. [The Biden administration has equipped Ukraine with arms and
military equipment totaling \$650 million in the last fiscal year
alone]{.underline}. The U.K. signed a Memorandum of Implementation on
naval contracts with Kyiv in 2021, while the U.S. signed a Strategic
Defense Framework and a Charter on Strategic Partnership with Ukraine.
200 Canadian soldiers are deployed in Ukraine as part of Operation
Unifier, and Ottawa has provided \$700 million worth of aid to Ukrainian
forces since 2014[. As part of broader efforts to augment its deterrence
posture following the 2014 invasion of Ukraine, NATO has increased its
deployments in the Black Sea (naval and air patrols) and reinforced the
Alliance's forward presence in Eastern and Southern Europe]{.underline}.
More recently, France has declared it would send troops to Romania as
part of NATO's "Enhanced Advanced Presence" missions. A strengthening of
NATO's military posture can also be seen in the Baltic countries and
Eastern Europe. Russia's Grievances and Resolve **[All of this triggers
great security concerns in Russia.]{.underline}** [Putin is suspicious
of NATO's defensive rhetoric,]{.underline} notably because of NATO's
interventions in Kosovo and Libya and its post-Cold War Eastern European
expansion. [For Russia, **U.S. support to Ukraine equates to a de facto
integration of Ukraine**]{.underline} -- short of the article 5
provision -- in NATO. U.S.' stated willingness to increase
interoperability between Ukraine and NATO is unacceptable for Moscow,
for security and ideological reasons. Ukraine's insistence on joining
NATO and NATO's firm support of its Open-Door policy (article 10) is at
the core of Russian grievances against the West. There is no way the
Kremlin will ever allow Ukraine to move forward with its ambition of
joining NATO, nor will NATO ever fight to help Ukraine do so.

### Link - Prolonged War

balances]{.mark}**. So god only knows where those weapons will end up
and when, in years to come, they will come to be used in other
situations.]{.underline} So, it\'s a very dangerous tactic. I know some
of the people in Europe who are calling for this, believe that they are
doing this out of the desire to protect the Ukrainian people. People
would like to help innocent Ukrainians, as I would. But sending more
arms in is not going to do that. The only solution is a negotiated peace
settlement.

Dangerous hubris [Putin appears to have dramatically overestimated
Russia's ability to quickly smash Ukrainian resistance, analysts
said.]{.underline} None of Ukraine's major cities have fallen, defying
even Western expectations. Unprecedented sanctions have torpedoed
Russia's national currency and its stock market, and sent Russian
citizens scrambling to join long lines at ATMs. Ukrainian resistance has
proven much stiffer than seemingly anyone expected. Now, [[Putin]{.mark}
[seems to have few good options to resolve the conflict]{.mark} without
losing face,]{.underline} analysts said. **[[Simply backing down now
could be perilous for him]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The Kremlin strongman
has spent two decades building a reputation as Russia's all-powerful,
irreplaceable leader, and racking up a string of swift military
victories along the way. Russian forces have engaged in protracted,
brutal military campaigns in Syria and in the Russian region of
Chechnya, that killed thousands of civilians. Russian soldiers and
leaders may balk at deploying similar tactics against Ukrainians, who
have strong historic and linguistic ties to Russians. But at the same
time, a humiliating climb-down in Ukraine could have implications for
Putin's future grip on power, Kremlin-watchers said. Russia would be
left saddled with devastating sanctions and cornered in political
isolation, with nothing to show for it. "[If he throws in the towel and
says, 'My bad, we messed up,' that **takes the veneer off his image as
Putin-the-mastermind,"**]{.underline} said Joshua Tucker, director of
New York University's Jordan Center for Advanced Study of Russia. The
crisis in Ukraine is already creating fissures in Russian society. Over
the weekend, two of Russia's richest and most loyal oligarchs openly
called for peace in Ukraine, a rare sign of defiance among the country's
ultra-wealthy elite. Over 6,400 people have been arrested in anti-war
protests in dozens of cities around Russia, according to OVD-Info, an
independent group that tracks the arrests. [[Putin]{.mark} seems, for
now, to [have placed himself in a]{.mark} strategic [position with few
good options to resolve the conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} Russia has
publicly demanded concessions including ceding the region of Crimea to
Russia, and the demilitarization of Ukraine. Yet as the assault has
bogged down, the possibility that Ukraine would concede such demands
appears increasingly remote, analysts said. [[Continuing]{.mark} with
[the assault will]{.mark} likewise [carry steep costs]{.mark} for
Russia]{.underline}. Western powers still have room to ratchet up the
sanctions regime even further. And more casualties will only increase
Russian domestic unrest over the conflict, analysts said. [Even a
conventional military victory by Russia using overwhelming force, which
many experts believe Russia can still achieve, would create the
possibility of a grinding guerrilla war for the foreseeable
future.]{.underline} Putin has also raised long-dormant anxieties about
Russia's nuclear capabilities by putting the country's nuclear forces on
"high alert," prompting nerve-wracking conversations about the
possibility of nuclear war that not long ago would have been considered
outlandish. Such talk is prompting Western officials to look for ways to
provide Putin with some kind of acceptable offramp. President Joe
Biden's White House says it doesn't want to overreact to Putin's nuclear
saber-rattling. But it remains unclear whether Putin would find any
Western proposals for deescalation acceptable. Like the big rat he once
chased down a corridor in Leningrad, [[Putin may decide the best way
out]{.mark} of a terrible situation [is to **ratchet up tensions even
further**]{.mark}]{.underline}**.** "[The question becomes, which is the
bigger fear: The fear that he'll look weak if he walks it back, or the
fear that the situation for Russia will get much worse if he steps it
up?]{.underline} That's what makes this a dangerous moment," Tucker
said.

action against Russia. [[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}, which has already

Could Russia invade other countries? [[Russia]{.mark} has [not stated
any intentions to push beyond Ukraine]{.mark},]{.underline} but Moscow
also previously said it would not invade Ukraine, so a further invasion
is certainly not impossible. [[Any]{.mark} further [drive **would be
incredibly risky for Russia**]{.mark}, particularly if its forces enter
a Nato state.]{.underline} Nato uses a system of collective security,
whereby its independent member states agree to mutual defence in
response to an attack by any external party. [That means [if Russia were
to invade]{.mark}, say Poland, Lithuania, Latvia or Estonia, [it would
automatically be at war with the US, UK and all 30 Nato members]{.mark},
and while Russia's forces are strong they would be dwarfed by Nato's
collective power.]{.underline}

What would be Russia's next steps if NATO accommodates it in Eastern
Ukraine[? It is **unlikely that Russia would keep expanding** if the
Ukrainian crisis were resolved on terms that Moscow could live
with.]{.underline} [First, because Russia's economy would endure massive
costs to sustain the war effort just to hold Kyiv, not to mention other
holds in Russia's near-abroad.]{.underline} The maximum-pressure
scenario -- [Russia's exclusion from the global economy -- would make it
near impossible for Russia to finance expansionist policies in the long
run, not to mention the local resistance Russia would face.]{.underline}
Furthermore, [Russia has **high stakes in protecting the status of the
Russian minority in Eastern Ukraine**]{.underline}. The [Ukrainization
of Russian minority areas in Ukraine]{.underline}, and Kyiv's indigenous
law excluding Russian minorities (as well as Ukrainian), [directly
affects Russia's identity as the protector of Russian
minorities]{.underline}. This Russian emotional involvement favors
Russian irredentism in Eastern Ukraine and militates against the idea
that Russia contemplates expansionist aims. [Ukraine's ideational
importance to Russia plays a significant part in motivating Russia's
revisionist policy towards Ukraine. Moscow ideational interests
elsewhere in the post-Soviet sphere are not as salient as they are in
Ukraine. Therefore, Russian expansion is unlikely, as not all land is
equally valuable from an emotional (and security)
standpoint.]{.underline}

#### [Capacity]{.underline} -- the Ukrainian invasion has [already failed]{.underline} and Russia doesn't have the capacity to expand further BUT pushing him [too far]{.underline} causes irrational escalation

Accessed 6-25-22, LASA-AH)

[Romney]{.underline} disagrees. Note that he does not argue against the
proposition that present U.S. actions (massively escalating military
support for Ukraine and getting closer to a "proxy war" while declining
to push for a diplomatic settlement) make a nuclear response from Russia
more likely. Instead, he appears to [argue]{.underline} [that it doesn't
matter that this makes Putin more likely to use a nuclear weapon,
because the alternative would be "paying the cannibal to eat us last"
and would mean that Putin can "invade and subjugate with near
impunity.]{.underline}" Some may find this persuasive, thinking a
diplomatic settlement would reward Russian aggression and encourage it
to invade countries in the future. But **[this narrative is
false]{.underline}**. As foreign relations expert [Anatol Lieven
explained in a recent Current Affairs interview, it overlooks the
crucial fact that Russia has already lost the war]{.underline}. Russia
failed in its objective, which was to topple and replace the Ukrainian
government. Russia has not even secured full control of the Donbas.
Russia has suffered immense losses of troops, had its economy wrecked,
become a pariah state, strengthened Ukraine as a nation, strengthened
NATO, and shown its military to be a paper tiger that cannot even
conquer territories within a few miles of its own border. This is a
critically important fact to understand. [A diplomatic settlement now
would not result in a "victory" for Russia that encourages further
invasions. Russia has proven that it is utterly and completely incapable
of invasions. It cannot even conquer a poor country like Ukraine. **It
is not going to invade Finland. It is not going to invade the United
States**]{.underline}. Russia has shown that it is not, in fact, any
kind of serious threat. Romney portrays Russia as a kind ravenous
cannibal that, if not stopped, will devour the entire world. Since
Russia cannot even devour the Donbas, this is an utterly deranged
fantasy. It is pure fearmongering. Once we understand that Russia has
already suffered a defeat, and has already been strongly disincentivized
from pursuing future invasions[, it becomes clear how insane it would be
at this point to take steps that could make Russia more likely to use
nuclear weapons. With the **aggression having failed to pay off,** what
we need is to facilitate a deal between Ukraine and Russia that both
parties can accept]{.underline}. Since [Putin is likely secretly eager
to find a way to end this calamity for his country without being
completely humiliated or losing power, such a deal (basic details of
which have been outlined by Lieven and Chomsky) should be within
reach.]{.underline} Or, [on the other hand, we could push Putin as far
as possible in order to maximally punish him, knowing that at any point
this irrational, violent, delusional man has a weapon in his back pocket
that could lead to the end of the world]{.underline}. We would, of
course, as Romney says, be doing this in the name of "freedom," even
though it could result in the gruesome deaths of millions. They would be
dead, and Ukraine would be a radioactive wasteland, but at least Putin
would have been taught a lesson.

to reduce collateral damage can be used by nonstate actors to target
**critical infrastructure** and **threaten civilians**]{.underline}.

[Precision-guided systems]{.underline} and standoff capabilities [have
become abundant and cheap]{.underline}. **[As a result]{.underline}**,
[these **systems are proliferating** into the hands of nonstate actors
who easily **evade the legal norms** surrounding their use.]{.underline}
**[Existing arms control]{.underline}** [and legal frameworks fail to
define and address the **unique and severe** threats posed by the
transfer of precision standoff capabilities and technologies to nonstate
actors]{.underline}, as they are focused primarily on denying
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. An explicit norm banning
these transfers would help states tackle a growing security threat,
through regulation and interdiction, and would also reduce the
international legitimacy of the proliferation of precision standoff
technologies.

[Nonstate actors are increasingly using precision weapons systems. The
**destructive effects**]{.underline} of this trend **[are not
theoretical]{.underline}**. [This is evident]{.underline} almost
anywhere one looks [in the Middle East]{.underline}. In Lebanon,
Hizballah is investing heavily in making its vast ballistic arsenal more
sophisticated and precise, including efforts to acquire the necessary
manufacturing capability and know-how. In Yemen, [**Houthi**
rebels]{.underline} have [used]{.underline} armed [drones to
target]{.underline} Saudi **[oil infrastructure]{.underline}**. The
abundance of precise systems is not exclusively an outcome of
Iranian-backed proliferation --- [the **Islamic State** has]{.underline}
also [used]{.underline} [weaponized drones]{.underline} on multiple
occasions in Iraq and Syria.

This phenomenon is by no means confined to the Middle East.
Surface-to-air missiles launched from pro-Russian separatist-controlled
territory in the Donbass shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. There
have been reports of [**Boko Haram** using attack drones in
**Nigeria**]{.underline}. Simultaneously, **[across the
globe]{.underline}**, [criminal organizations are beginning to harness
aerial capabilities.]{.underline} [The adoption of drones for violent
uses has apparently already begun in the war between **Mexican drug
cartels**.]{.underline}

[Using precision technology and standoff capabilities, nonstate actors
can **cause more damage** now than in the past. These technologies are
**readily available**]{.underline}, [cost less, **do more**, and
**require less expertise**]{.underline}. [Standoff capabilities
challenge the ability to retaliate and to eliminate threats in real
time.]{.underline} Some of these systems are being transferred by
increasingly persistent "rogue" proliferators, but others are a part of
the so-called "support" given by global and regional powers to local
actors. As [the threshold for the acquisition and use of
technologies]{.underline} such as unmanned aerial systems, drones, and
quadcopters [has been **significantly lowered**]{.underline}, nonstate
actors are also innovatively weaponizing commercially available
technologies.

In the coming years, [as technology for precision-guided systems
**continues to advance**]{.underline}, [the challenges]{.underline} are
likely to **[increase]{.underline}**. First, [these systems
are]{.underline} sure [to **become more lethal**]{.underline} ---
[nonstate actors will have more precise weapon systems, with **bigger
payloads** and **more of them**]{.underline}. Secondly, [the ability to
deploy these systems will **improve significantly** and they may be
**increasingly autonomous**]{.underline}. [Operating these systems from
longer ranges will **become easier**]{.underline}, and the use of
predetermined GPS targets (or other Global Navigation Satellite Systems)
or [AI algorithms]{.underline} [could **reduce** the **role of humans**
in the decision-making process. The use of space-related **commercial
intelligence**]{.underline} gathering platforms, such as Google Earth,
[helps different entities to easily **acquire precise
targets**]{.underline}. These new technologies might also simplify the
use of nonconventional weapons, as, for example, a drone or quadcopter
could easily disperse chemical agents.

## Various Advantage CPs

### Hotlines CP

#### The United States federal government should establish a national defense hotline with \[x\].

#### That solves.

**Walker 21** -- Leah Walker is a future digital security fellow at the
Institute for Security and Technology. (Leah Walker, \"Zoom Won't Stop a
Nuclear War,\" Foreign Policy, 4-19-2021,

Accessed 6-25-2022, LASA-SC)

[As]{.underline} [nuclear-armed states seek to]{.underline} **[reduce
the risk of nuclear conflict]{.underline}** [in a new era of multipolar
great-power competitio]{.underline}n, [rethinking hotlines should be at
the]{.underline} **[top of their agenda]{.underline}**. In many ways,
[this is low-hanging fruit that could serve as the technical catalyst
for expanded trust and dialogue]{.underline}. Indeed, France, as the new
chair of the P5 Process, has embraced the concept of "strategic risk
reduction" and will make improving crisis communication technologies
like hotlines a key priority for discussion among the United Nations
Security Council's permanent five members ahead of and beyond the
planned Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty this
August.

In turn, [various governmental and nongovernmental voices have made
broad proposals for nuclear-weapons states to consider whether they are
serious about improving the security environment]{.underline}. For
example, the 16 countries participating in the Stockholm Initiative have
identified a list of "[stepping]{.underline} stones" [toward nuclear
disarmamen]{.underline}t, which **[includes improving
hotlines]{.underline}**. At the same time, another coalition of 12
countries that form the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative has
also included [the need for crisis-proof communication lines in its
"landing zones]{.underline}," or [areas of potential agreement, to
reduce nuclear risks]{.underline}. The Global Enterprise to Strengthen
Non-Proliferation and Disarmament has also pointed out that
communications links between nuclear weapons states "are not universal,
and those that do exist warrant review."

Our organizations---[the Institute for Security and Technology and the
European Leadership Network]{.underline}---[are looking at nuclear
weapon decision-making in the face of technological
complexity]{.underline}. In particular, the Institute for Security and
Technology team has closely examined global nuclear command, control,
and communications systems and outlined what an innovative global
hotline---dubbed "Catalink"---could look like. This project has gone
beyond the conceptual stage and is ready for evaluation by the
nuclear-armed states. Such an evaluation could be undertaken without
change to their policies, postures, or arsenals, and it would feature
well into their effort to take a more strategic approach to nuclear risk
reduction while tensions rise in conflict zones across the globe.

[Given the very real risks of nuclear escalation through
misinterpretation of rhetoric or actions, or the miscalculation of
responses due to ambiguity and secrecy, **leaders must have the ability
to speak clearly, confidently, and confidentially.**]{.underline}

[Maintaining stability and preventing nuclear use in an unstable
multipolar world that includes nine nuclear-armed states is impossible
using the bipolar logic and inadequate systems of the Cold
War.]{.underline} Modern, robustly encrypted, and survivable
multilateral communication systems available to nuclear decision-makers
are needed to face the perils of the 21st-century nuclear reality.
Hotlines are due for an urgent upgrade.

### 1NC\-\--T-Semi-Autonomus

#### Violation. PGMs are semi-autonomous.

Heather **Roff** 1-16-20**15**, Senior Research Fellow at the University
of Oxford Department of Politics and International Relations and
Research Scientist at the Global Security Initiative, \"Autonomous or
\'Semi\' Autonomous Weapons? A Distinction Without Difference\",
HuffPost,
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/autonomous-or-semi-autono_b_6487268, DL

[We have]{.underline} roughly [**four functions** on a weapons system:
trigger, targeting, navigation, and mobility]{.underline}. We might
think of these functions like a menu that we can order from.
[Semi-autonomous weapons have at least one, if not three, of
these]{.underline} functions. For instance, we might say that the
Samsung SGR-1 has an \"autonomous\" targeting function (through heat and
motion detectors), but is incapable of navigation, mobility or
triggering, as it is a sentry-bot mounted on a defensive perimeter.
Likewise, we would say that [precision guided munitions are]{.underline}
also **[semi-autonomous]{.underline}**, [for they have autonomous
mobility, triggering, and in some cases navigation, while the targeting
is done through a **preselected set** of coordinates or through
**\"painting\" a target** through laser guidance.]{.underline}

Emerging factors that may affect PGM programs. Another potential issue
for Congress is how DOD's programs for developing and procuring [[PGMs
might be **affected by**]{.mark} emerging factors such as]{.underline}

 the U.S. withdrawal from the Intermediate Nuclear Force (INF)
treaty;96

 new U.S. military operational concepts for countering Chinese A2/AD
forces in the Indo-Pacific region, such as the Army's new Multi-Domain
Operations (MDO) operational concept and the Marine Corps' new
Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO) concept, both of which
possibly feature the potential use of such weapons from island locations
in the Pacific as a way of countering China's A2/AD forces; and

 [emerging technologies such as]{.underline} hypersonics and
**[[a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence]{.underline}** (AI). 97
