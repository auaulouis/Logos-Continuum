## Case

### 1NC\-\--ASATs\-\--China ASAT Defense

#### China [won't]{.underline} use [ASATs]{.underline}.

Gregory **Kulacki, 16** (Gregory Kulacki is an expert on cross-cultural
communication between the United States and China and is the China
project manager and senior analyst at UCS, 9-7-2016, accessed on

Although Chinese research, development and testing of ASAT capabilities
continues [there is no indication Chinese military planners intend to
launch a pre-emptive strike against US
sat]{.underline}ellite[s]{.underline} at the beginning of a future war
with the United States. Moreover, [Chinese military strategists **do not
see** the US military use of satellites as a **weakness** they can
**exploit**]{.underline}. To the contrary, they see it as a strength
they should emulate. Nevertheless, US concerns about a Chinese "space
Pearl Harbor" attack on US satellites continue to cast a large shadow
over US perceptions of Chinese space policy and programs.

Consequential Chinese Realities

Over the past 16 years China steadily increased the number and
capabilities of its satellites.

The first US warnings of a Chinese ASAT attack came at a time when China
had no significant presence in space. Today China ranks second, behind
the United States, in the number of functioning satellites on orbit. The
planned introduction of a new generation of launch vehicles capable of
placing heavier payloads into space suggests the number of functioning
Chinese satellites will continue to increase. Congressionally imposed
restrictions on civil and scientific cooperation with China make it
difficult for US observers to assess progress in the quality and
capabilities of Chinese satellites. But accounts of Chinese cooperation
with the European Space Agency and media reports on advances in Chinese
satellite technology suggest the quality of Chinese satellites is
increasing at a rate comparable to the increase in quantity.

The military value of China's satellites is arguably much greater than
the value of its ASAT research, development and testing program.
Satellites are a force multiplier that use the inherent advantages of
space to augment the communication, command, control, intelligence,
reconnaissance, surveillance and navigation functions of military forces
on earth. In addition to helping Chinese commanders control their own
forces, satellites can significantly increase their ability to find US
forces over very large areas, track their movement, guide munitions to
these targets and assess the damage afterwards.

US Turning the Table on Chinese ASATs

A recent US study of the technologies likely to be employed in a future
war in the Western Pacific suggests that instead of being a trump card
that a militarily weaker China might use to defeat a stronger United
States, [ASAT weapons]{.underline} could [play a **key role** in helping
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[contain
China]{.underline}**. This is because satellites make it possible for
China to threaten US and allied ships sailing thousands of kilometers
away from Chinese shores. As the study states:

"...[the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [enjoys
a variety of alternatives to military satellites that could **allow
operations** even **without it**]{.underline}. [For the
Chinese]{.underline}, by contrast, [survivable sea-surveillance radar
satellites would make the **difference** between accepting a U.S. sphere
of influence]{.underline} covering much of the Western Pacific [and the
**opportunity** to **threaten** U.S.-allied commerce]{.underline} out to
or beyond the Second Island Chain. For China, [the military difference
between satellites and their absence is thus **important** in ways that
go **far beyond efficiency**]{.underline}. "

In other words, [China's **military dependence** on
satellites]{.underline} may be [**greater** than that of
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. Perhaps that
is why some US officials argue the United States should refuse to
support international efforts to place limits on the use of
anti-satellite weapons.

[In-space manufacturing is another field of space development that can
bring new capabilities currently unaccounted for the space security
sector planning]{.underline}. Large aperture satellites with tens of
kilowatts of electrical power and extremely large antennas can overcome
jamming. [Large space platforms in geosynchronous orbit with tens to
hundreds of kilowatts of power can host a multiplicity of payloads,
which can be upgraded, refueled, and re-tasked, providing capabilities
unheard today]{.underline}. [Such large platforms can have defensive
mechanisms to protect itself from all but the most determined
attacks]{.underline}. Skycorp is developing lightweight highly
maneuverable solar electric propulsion vehicles that are the world's
first reusable systems. Our internal systems architecture roadmap and
cost analysis indicates that reusable spacecraft have lifecycle cost
reduction potential exceeding 80% through re-provisioning, modularity,
and interchangeable payload modules. [These systems, soon to be built on
the International Space Station (2020 timeframe), first deploying
commercial communications payloads]{.underline}, [will help to correct
the growing imbalance between terrestrial and space communications

propulsion would]{.mark} simply [be able to move out of the way of most
ballistic threats]{.mark}, thus [passively defeating attacks]{.mark}**.
[The more systems]{.mark} that can be built with characteristics

Harbor]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This, along with the other capabilities
outlined in this missive, if implemented, neuter current
threats]{.underline}. [[These capabilities]{.mark} help [reduce global
instability and]{.mark} help [maintain our national]{.mark} [security

So Why Won't It Happen? Well, never say never. You might not make to the
end of this paragraph before the sky lights up and the world goes dark.
[But [there are]{.mark} some [good reasons to be optimistic]{.mark} that
won't happen. One reassuring factor is that [the more]{.mark} other
[countries develop their militaries, the more dependent on networks they
become]{.mark} as well]{.underline}. China is developing its own drone
programme, and so is Russia, which will both presumably be dependent on
satellites to operate. [And the more their (and our) economies and
business interests develop, the more everyone will rely on satellites to
further their economic ambitions. [In the event that countries]{.mark}
were to start [knock]{.mark}ing [out each other's satellites]{.mark} on
a large scale, [the consequences]{.mark} across the board -- [for
everyone -- would be disastrous]{.mark}.]{.underline} It would also be
expensive in the short term. [[Getting things into orbit]{.mark} --
peaceful or otherwise -- still [isn't cheap]{.mark}, which is why only a
handful of countries regularly do so.]{.underline} And if you want to
blow up a network of many satellites today (as you would have to in a
first strike, to ensure other satellites couldn't pick up the slack),
launching small satellites or missiles into orbit is the only practical
way to do that -- [[arming satellites with their own weaponry]{.mark}
just [isn't]{.mark} financially or technologically [feasible]{.mark} on
a grand scale]{.underline}. We are, happily, a long way from a Death
Star. "I don't think \[a large first strike\] would be financially too
costly \[if you're\] thinking about kinetic energy weapons and the
air-based or ground-based lasers," says Jasani. "It's viable. But if you
say, 'I'm going to put an \[ASAT\] weapon \[permanently\] in orbit', we
are then getting into very expensive and very complicated technology. So
my guess is that in the foreseeable future, what we are going to focus
on are the kinetic energy weapons and possibly lasers that could blind
satellites or affect, for example, the solar panels. That kind of
technology will be delivered in the foreseeable future, rather than
having lasers in orbit \[like\] the Star Wars kind of thing." [But
there's another, possibly even more persuasive reason that a kinetic war
in space may not happen: [it's]{.mark} just so much [easier]{.mark} --
and less damaging -- [to]{.mark} mess with satellites without getting
close to them. "[Jam]{.mark}ming [from the ground]{.mark} is not
difficult," says Quintana]{.underline}. "If you look at the Middle East,
pick a country where there's a crisis and the chances are that the
military in that country has tried to jam a commercial satellite to try
and avoid satellite TV channels broadcasting anti-government messages."
"[My guess is that by the time we are ready for [space warfare]{.mark},
I think you may not be [bank]{.mark}ing [on]{.mark} your hit-to-kill
ASATs, but more on \[[non-destructive]{.mark}\] high-energy laser-based
[systems]{.mark},"]{.underline} Jasani agrees. ["\[Space [debris\]
affects all sides]{.mark}, not just the attacked side.]{.underline} The
attacking side will have its own satellites in orbit, which might be
affected by the debris \[of its own attack\]." And if you really need to
remove an enemy's satellite coverage, you can always try to flatten or
hack the control stations on the ground, leaving the satellites talking
with no-one to listen. ["I don't think physically blowing things up from
the ground is something that people are looking at again,]{.underline}"
says Quintana. "Countries and governments try to find means other than
physical conflict to achieve their strategic ends. [So [as space becomes
more commercial and]{.mark} more [civilian]{.mark} and as more
scientific satellites go up, then you'll find that **[states will not
seek to directly attack each other]{.mark}**, but will seek other
means.]{.underline} "It may just be that they will try to cyber-attack
the satellites and take them over, which has been done in the past. It's
much easier to physically or cyber-attack the ground control station
than it is to attack the satellite itself - so why would you not look to
do that as a first port of call and achieve the same ends?" Ultimately,
then, what might keep us safe from a war in space isn\'t the horror of
explosives in orbit, but a question of cost and convenience.

D. ASAT Implications for SSA Data Sharing

Given humanity\'s history of ASAT weapons tests, how should SSA data
sharing policies be shaped today? [Does the fact that ASAT weapons have
been developed and successfully tested mean that they will inevitably be
used in war, or are there reasons to discount that risk?]{.underline} Do
the safety gains from broader and more timely sharing of SSA data
outweigh the risks that some of those data could be used to target an
ASAT attack? Or might expanded SSA about enemy capabilities and
intentions provide a strong enough foundation to exercise deterrent
options that would otherwise be unavailable? This article will now
evaluate arguments that minimize the likelihood of an ASAT attack and
explain why the ASAT threat remains real.

1\. [Factors Discouraging ASAT Use]{.underline}

[If an [ASAT]{.mark} weapon is ever used as an act of war, its use
[is]{.mark} likely to be [**significantly more difficult** than]{.mark}
any of the ASAT [tests]{.mark} conducted to date. [In]{.mark} the
[tests, states]{.mark} have [target]{.mark}ed their **[own
assets]{.mark} only**, and in many cases have launched the ASAT weapon
and its target together [in]{.mark} **close [proximity]{.mark}**[.
Belligerents will **not**]{.mark} **always [have]{.mark} those
[luxuries]{.mark}**, especially [as]{.mark} satellite [operators
improve]{.mark} the **[encryption]{.mark}** of their signals and their
own SSA capabilities, [and]{.mark} employ strategies such as
**[disaggregat]{.mark}ing** satellite [functions]{.mark} and using
civilian commercial satellites, sometimes from neutral or friendly
countries, for military purposes]{.underline}. 228

[In addition, there are the **moral, legal, political, and [practical
considerations]{.mark}** that [weigh against]{.mark} using at least a
kinetic ASAT. [Most]{.mark} countries with space programs advanced
enough to field an ASAT weapon will **[not want]{.mark} to set [a
precedent]{.mark}** [that legitimizes]{.mark} a [retal]{.mark}iatory
ASAT attack on their own **sat**ellite**s**, [and]{.mark} they will also
have]{.underline} \[\*78\] [to [consider]{.mark} the likely effects of
**[debris]{.mark}** from their attack against their own and their
allies\' space assets in the future. For an advanced space power,
threatening to destroy satellites in order to deter ASAT attacks by a
less-developed space power would be the strategic [equivalent of
**\"threatening a**]{.mark} **chess opponent\'s [knight]{.mark} in hopes
of [deterring]{.mark} him [from]{.mark} taking [your
queen.\"]{.mark}**]{.underline} 229 [Another analogy might be that of
**[using a]{.mark} hand [grenade to defend]{.mark} one\'s home [from a
burglar]{.mark}**]{.underline}: self-defense may well be justified, but
[the defensive [weapon]{.mark} would **[cause so much]{.mark} collateral
[damage]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} even **[self-harm]{.mark}** that [it
would **not make sense**]{.mark} **to use it** in most
circumstances]{.underline}. Moreover, [some of the most sensitive
[military **sat**]{.mark}ellite[**s** are]{.mark} located [in **GSO**,
where]{.mark} the **[costs]{.mark}** of sending an ASAT missile [are
**much higher** and]{.mark} the costs of **[international
censure]{.mark}** much [higher]{.mark} given the GSO\'s distance and
importance as a limited natural resource]{.underline}. 230

In an effort [to reduce the expected utility of an ASAT
attack]{.underline} (as well as damages from an accidental collision or
space weather event), [the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [is seeking to [**spread out** and
**distribute** its]{.mark} space-based [capabilities]{.mark} so as [to
ensure **resiliency**]{.mark} and continued service **even if** an
individual satellite or set of satellites is knocked out]{.underline}.
231 [Just as Iridium kept a spare satellite in orbit that it moved to
fill the void left by the Iridium-33]{.underline} in February 2009, [the
[GPS]{.mark} constellation [includes]{.mark} a **number of
[spares]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} the U.S. [military]{.mark}
is]{.underline} reportedly [examining concepts to
[launch]{.mark}]{.underline} as many as 3,000 small
**[[\"cubesats\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** over the next few years [to
improve]{.underline} the [resiliency]{.underline} of its satellite
capabilities. 232 [Other countries could]{.underline} also [implement
similar \"hedging\" strategies]{.underline}.

**Neither the U.S. nor China will test again**

Dr. Mark **Gubrud 7**, Adjunct Professor in the Peace, War, and Defense
Curriculum at the University of North Carolina, Contributor to the

Some strong arguments support proposals to focus attention on kinetic
energy ASATs. Such weapons, which directly strike targets at high
speeds, create large amounts of persistent orbital debris, an
increasingly serious threat to all traffic in space. China's addition to
the debris burden has been condemned worldwide and has raised the
concern that further tests, or a war in space using such weapons, might
render space unusable for military or civilian purposes. [The
[U.S.]{.mark} military]{.underline} shares this concern, [[has not
tested]{.mark} a kinetic-energy weapon against an orbital target [in
over **two decades**, and]{.mark}]{.underline} apparently **[[does not
plan to do so]{.mark} in the future]{.underline}**. Given that at least
a live-impact testing ban would be highly verifiable (since it is
impossible to hide the debris shower), [the U.S. military might not
object to such a ban]{.underline}, particularly if framed as a
debris-control measure rather than as arms control. [Yet, **[even
in]{.mark} the [absence of]{.mark} such [a ban]{.mark}**[, China
will]{.mark} likely [judge]{.mark} that the **[p]{.mark}**ublic
**[r]{.mark}**elations [costs]{.mark} of further orbital impact tests
**[outweigh any]{.mark} military [gains]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As
Forden states, [the weapon can be tested adequately in **close flybys**,
including at **high**]{.underline} (e.g., [**geosynchronous)
altitudes**, and can be impact tested against suborbital targets, at
high closing speeds as the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [does, with its missile defense
tests]{.underline}. Forden proposes criteria that would ban the former
but would permit the latter. [Under such rules, terminal homing systems
could be **perfected openly**. Intermediate-range target acquisition and
tracking systems could be tested in low-closing-speed rendezvous
operations, since high-speed flybys are not needed to verify their
performance at the required updating rates]{.underline}. Thus, the
**[further development of kinetic-energy ASAT technology would not be
blocked]{.underline}**.

Space", 2019 11th International Conference on Cyber Conflict: Silent
Battle, https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2019/06/Art_12_The-Cyber-ASAT.pdf

A. Limited Accessibility

Space is difficult. Over 60 years have passed since the first Sputnik
launch and only nine countries (ten including the EU) have orbital
launch capabilities. Moreover, [a launch programme alone does not
guarantee the **resources** and **precision required** to **operate a
meaningful ASAT capability**.]{.underline} Given this, one possible
reason why **[[space wars have not broken out]{.underline}]{.mark}** is
simply [because only the US has ever had the ability to fight
one]{.underline} \[21, p. 402\], \[22, pp. 419--420\].

[Although launch technology may become cheaper and easier, it is unclear
to what extent these advances will be distributed among presently
non-spacefaring nations. **[Limited access to orbit]{.mark}**
necessarily [reduces]{.mark} the [scenarios which could]{.mark}
plausibly [escalate]{.mark} to ASAT usage.]{.underline} Only major
conflicts between the handful of states with 'space club' membership
could be considered possible flashpoints. Even then, the [**[fragility
of]{.mark} an attacker's [own]{.mark} space [assets]{.mark}** [creates
**de-escalatory pressures** due to]{.mark} the **[deterrent effect of
retal]{.mark}iation**. Since]{.underline} the earliest days of [the
space race, dominant [powers]{.mark} have recognized this dynamic and
[demonstrated]{.mark} an inclination **[towards de-escalatory]{.mark}
space [strategies]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[23\].

B. Attributable Norms

[There]{.underline} also [exists a **long-standing normative framework**
favouring the **peaceful use of space**.]{.underline} The effectiveness
of this regime, centred around the Outer Space Treaty
[[(**OST**)]{.underline},]{.mark} is highly contentious and many have
pointed out its serious legal and political shortcomings \[24\]--\[26\].
Nevertheless, this status quo framework has somehow [[supported]{.mark}
over **[six decades of]{.mark} relative [peace]{.mark}** in
orbit.]{.underline}

Over these six decades, [**norms have become deeply ingrained** into the
way states describe and perceive space weaponization.]{.underline} This
de facto codification was dramatically demonstrated in 2005 when the US
found itself on the short end of a 160-1 UN vote after opposing a
non-binding resolution on space weaponization. [Although states have
occasionally pushed the boundaries of these norms, this]{.underline} has
typically [occurred through incremental legal
re-interpretation]{.underline} rather than outright opposition \[27\].
Even the most notable incidents, such as the 2007-2008 US and Chinese
ASAT demonstrations, were couched in rhetoric from both the norm
violators and defenders, depicting space as a peaceful global commons
\[27, p. 56\]. Altogether, this suggests that [**[states
perceive]{.mark} real [costs]{.mark}** [to breaking this]{.mark}
normative [tradition and]{.mark} may even **[moderate]{.mark} their
[behaviours]{.mark}** accordingly.]{.underline}

One further factor supporting this norms regime is the [**high degree of
attributability** surrounding ASAT weapons.]{.underline} For kinetic
ASAT technology, [[**plausible deniability** and **stealth** are]{.mark}
essentially **[impossible]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The literally
explosive act of launching a rocket cannot evade detection and, if used
offensively, retaliation. [This imposes **high diplomatic costs** on
ASAT usage]{.underline} and testing, particularly during peacetime.

C. Environmental Interdependence

[A third [stabilizing force relates to]{.mark} the **orbital [debris
consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline} of ASATs. China's 2007 ASAT
demonstration was the largest debris-generating event in history, as the
targeted satellite dissipated into thousands of dangerous debris
particles \[28, p. 4\]. [Since debris particles are
[indiscriminate]{.mark} and unpredictable, [they]{.mark} often
[threaten]{.mark} the [attacker's own]{.mark} space
[assets]{.mark}]{.underline} \[22, p. 420\]. This is compounded by
Kessler syndrome, a phenomenon whereby orbital debris 'breeds' as large
pieces of debris collide and disintegrate. As space debris remains in
orbit for hundreds of years, the [**cascade effect** of an ASAT attack
can constrain the attacker's long-term use of space]{.underline} \[29,
pp. 295-- 296\]. Any state with kinetic ASAT capabilities will likely
also operate satellites of its own, and they are necessarily exposed to
this collateral damage threat. [Space debris thus acts as a strong
strategic deterrent to ASAT usage.]{.underline}

In fact, the negligible role of cyberattacks in the Ukraine conflict
should come as no surprise. Through war simulations, statistical
analyses, and other kinds of studies, scholars have found little
evidence that cyber-operations provide effective forms of coercion or
that they cause escalation to actual military conflict. That is because
for all its potential to disrupt companies, hospitals, and utility grids
during peacetime, [cyberpower is **much harder** to use against targets
of **strategic significance** or to **achieve outcomes** with **decisive
impacts**]{.underline}, either on the battlefield or during crises short
of war. [In failing to recognize this]{.underline}, [U.S.]{.underline}
officials and policymakers are [approaching the use of cyberpower in a
way that may be doing **more harm than good**]{.underline}---treating
cyber-operations like any other weapon of war rather than as a nonlethal
instrument of statecraft and, [in the process]{.underline}, [overlooking
the **considerable opportunities** as well as **risks** they
present]{.underline}. Much of the [current
[understanding]{.mark}]{.underline} in Washington [[about]{.mark} the
role of [cyber]{.mark}-operations in conflict is [built
on]{.mark}]{.underline} long-standing but [**[false]{.mark}
[assumptions]{.mark}** about cyberspace]{.underline}. Many scholars have
asserted that cyber-operations could easily lead to military escalation,
up to and including the use of nuclear weapons. Jason Healey and Robert
Jervis, for example, expressing a widely held view, have argued that an
incident that takes place in cyberspace, "might cross the threshold into
armed conflict either through a sense of impunity or through
miscalculation or mistake." Policymakers have also long believed that
cyberspace poses grave perils. In 2012, Secretary of Defense Leon
Panetta warned of an impending "cyber-Pearl Harbor," in which
adversaries could take down critical U.S. infrastructure through
cyberattacks. Nearly a decade later, FBI Director Christopher Wray
compared the threat from ransomware---when actors hold a target hostage
by encrypting data and demanding a ransom payment in return for
decrypting it---to the 9/11 attacks. And as recently as December 2021,
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin noted that in cyberspace, "norms of
behavior aren't well-established and the risks of escalation and
miscalculation are high." Seemingly buttressing these claims has been a
long record of cyber-operations by hostile governments. In recent years,
states ranging from Russia and China to Iran and North Korea have used
cyberspace to conduct large-scale espionage, inflict significant
economic damage, and undermine democratic institutions. In January 2021,
for example, attackers linked to the Chinese government were able to
breach Microsoft's Exchange email servers, giving them access to
communications and other private information from companies and
governments, and may have allowed other malicious actors to conduct
ransomware attacks. That breach followed on the heels of a Russian
intrusion against the software vendor SolarWinds, in which hackers were
able to access a huge quantity of sensitive government and corporate
data---an espionage treasure trove. Cyberattacks have also inflicted
significant economic costs. The NotPetya attack affected critical
infrastructure around the world---ranging from logistics and energy to
finance and government---causing upward of \$10 billion in damage. But
[the **[assumption]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} [cyber]{.mark}-operations
play a central role in either **[provok]{.mark}ing** [or]{.mark}
**[extend]{.mark}ing [war]{.mark}** [is **wrong**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[**Hundreds** of cyber[-incidents]{.mark} have [occurred]{.mark}
[between]{.mark} [rivals]{.mark} with **long histories**]{.underline} of
tension or even conflict, [[but]{.mark} **[none]{.mark}** has **ever**
**[triggered]{.mark}** an **[escalation]{.mark}** to war]{.underline}.
[**No**r]{.underline}th **[Ko]{.underline}**rea, for example, has
[conducted **major** cyberattacks against **So**]{.underline}uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [on at least four different
occasions]{.underline}, including the "Ten Days of Rain" denial of
service attack---in which a network is flooded with an overwhelming
number of requests, becoming temporarily inaccessible to users---against
South Korean government websites, financial institutions, and critical
infrastructure in 2011 and the "Dark Seoul" attack in 2013, which
disrupted service across the country's financial and media sectors. It
would be [reasonable to expect that these operations might **escalate**
the situation on the **Korean Peninsula**]{.underline}, especially
because North Korea's war plans against South Korea reportedly involve
cyber-operations. [Yet that is **not what happened**]{.underline}.
Instead, in each case, the South Korean response was minimal and limited
to either direct, official attribution to North Korea by government
officials or more indirect public suggestions that Pyongyang was likely
behind the attacks. Similarly, although the United States reserves the
right to respond to cyberattacks in any way it sees fit, including with
military force, it has until now relied on economic sanctions,
indictments, diplomatic actions, and some reported instances of
tit-for-tat cyber-responses. For example, following Russia's
interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Obama
administration expelled 35 Russian diplomats and shuttered two
facilities said to be hubs for Russian espionage. The Treasury
Department also levied economic sanctions against Russian officials. Yet
according to media reports, the administration ultimately rejected plans
to conduct retaliatory cyber-operations against Russia. And although the
United States did use its own cyber-operations to respond to Russian
attacks during the 2018 midterm elections, it limited itself to
temporarily disrupting the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll
farm. These measured responses are not unusual. [Despite decades of

But [as the invasion continues with **few signs** of any **sophisticated

**vaunted** [cyber]{.mark} capabilities have [been
**neglected**]{.mark}]{.underline} in recent years, [in favor of
developing]{.underline} less expensive, [**less effective** cyber
weapons]{.underline} that cause less widespread damage and are
considerably easier to contain and defend against. For instance, [many
of the cyber[attacks]{.mark}]{.underline} directed at Ukraine
[[in]{.mark} the [past month]{.mark} have [been]{.mark} relatively
[basic]{.mark} distributed
**[d]{.mark}**]{.underline}enial-**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f-**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**ervice
[[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}, in which hackers bombard Ukrainian
government websites and servers with so much online traffic that those
servers cannot respond to legitimate users and are forced offline for
some period of time. Denial-of-service attacks can be effective for
short-term disruptions but they're hardly a new or impressive cyber
capability---in fact, they're what Russia used to target Estonia more
than a decade ago in 2007. Moreover, [launching these types of attacks
requires **no sophisticated** technical **capabilities**]{.underline} or
discovery of new vulnerabilities, [and they]{.underline} typically
[[have]{.underline}]{.mark} fairly [**[contained impacts]{.mark}** on
the]{.underline} specific, [targeted computers]{.underline}. Similarly,
recent reports that Belarusian hackers are trying to phish European
officials using compromised accounts belonging to Ukrainian armed
services members suggests that not only are these efforts relying on
fairly basic tactics like phishing emails, they are not even being
carried out by Russian military hackers directly.

In its 2020 Global Counterspace Capabilities assessment, the Secure
World Foundation noted there was "significant evidence that Russia is
actively employing counterspace capabilities in current military
conflicts."xvi Current Russian counterspace capabilities include various
kinetic systems, directed energy weapons, and other tools of electronic
and cyber warfare. Russia has tested direct-ascent ASAT missiles
intended to intercept targets in low-Earth orbit (LEO) on several
occasions. xvii Russia has also developed and launched several
satellites that have demonstrated the ability to rendezvous with other
space objects.xviii The maneuvering and rendezvous ability demonstrated
by these satellites could be applied to co-orbital ASAT capabilities,
such as satellites that are capable of docking and physically
interfering with others.xix Ultimately, however, [a kinetic ASAT
capability is **unlikely** to be Russia's weapon of choice
in]{.underline} a near-future [space]{.underline} conflict, [given
Russian **leadership's assessment** that its conventional **military
power** is inferior to that of the U.S. and NATO]{.underline}, [which
would make a direct competition of power a **losing
game**]{.underline}.xx Further, [if there is anything the Kremlin
learned]{.underline} from its warfare in Ukraine, [it is that **open
aggression** should be **avoided**]{.underline}, [as it will
**preclude** the state from **denying responsibility** for armed
conflict]{.underline}.xxi [A kinetic counterspace attack would
be]{.underline} relatively [easy to attribute]{.underline} to a
particular actor---[using one would paint Russia as an **antagonist**
and draw **unwelcome scrutiny**]{.underline}.

But now, [even as the Russian army drops bombs and mortar
shells]{.underline} on civilians [in]{.underline} hospitals and
neighborhoods and its invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline} nears its fourth
week, **[no known nightmare cyber scenario]{.underline}** --- a
widespread power outage, a poisoned water system, a crippled supply
chain -- [has come to pass in Ukraine]{.underline}, [the US or
elsewhere]{.underline}. Ukraine detains \'hacker\' accused of aiding
Russian troops amid broader struggle to secure communications To be
sure, a ripple of smaller cyberattacks ricocheted through the websites
of Ukrainian banks and government agencies just before the invasion, and
larger attacks may still be in store for the besieged country of 43
million people. But the general consensus among the nearly 20 experts
who spoke with CNN for this story is that [while Russia is well
positioned to launch catastrophic cyberattacks on the US]{.underline},
[it is **not likely** to do so]{.underline}. "[We]{.underline} do [need
to consider this possibility as]{.underline} a **[low
probability]{.underline}** but high-impact scenario," said Paul
Prudhomme, the head of threat intelligence advisory at the cybersecurity
firm IntSights. The [prospects for a grand-scale cyberattack in America
are **low**]{.underline}, experts say. For one, [Putin **understands**
that his country's cyber capabilities]{.underline}, though formidable,
[are **outmatched** by those of the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, which is generally thought to be the most
sophisticated player in the domain. The federal Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency told CNN it hasn't yet received any
credible cyber threats resulting from the conflict in Ukraine, but it
emphasized that the energy sector has been bolstering its defenses in
recent years and is on high alert as it urgently prepares for any
attempted breach. Experts say Russia's ability to conduct an impactful
cyberattack in the US shouldn't be underestimated. "If we look at just
what they've been able to do, there is only, according to public
knowledge, one country out there that has any experience taking down
electric systems -- that's Russia," said Robert M. Lee, a cybersecurity
expert who investigated the 2015 attack in Ukraine. Testing the waters
Cyberattacks against the US by Russia are more than merely possible --
they've been happening for years on a low-grade scale. The country has
been testing the waters in the US, laying the groundwork, experts say,
for a much more extensive cyber campaign. For instance, in 2018, the
Department of Homeland Security revealed that a group of state-sponsored
hackers from Russia had compromised the networks of multiple US electric
utilities the year prior and allowed intruders to gather detailed
information on the control systems that US electric utilities use to
power American communities. That same year, the Department of Justice
announced the indictments of 12 Russian intelligence officers for
carrying out large-scale cyber operations against the Democratic Party
in advance of the 2016 presidential election. Then, in late 2020, came
the most advanced cyber-op yet: About 100 organizations around the world
-- including multiple US government agencies -- were revealed to have
been breached by Russian hackers who compromised the software provider
SolarWinds and exploited their access to monitor internal operations and
withdraw data. Putin has been systematically testing vulnerabilities in
Europe and the US for the past four years, and is in a position to cause
all sorts of economy-crushing problems, experts say. "They know how to
weaponize these things -- they've done it," said Melissa Hathaway, who
led cybersecurity initiatives in the presidential administrations of
George W. Bush and Barack Obama. "If I need to cause a national crisis
in another country, they know how to do this, they've systematically
been testing the system." Prudhomme said a stealthy Russian hacking
group called Energetic Bear -- which has been tied to Moscow's Federal
Security Service, or FSB -- is the most likely Russian third-party,
state-sponsored actor to execute any high-level attack. The group, which
industry analysts refer to by several aliases, including "Dragonfly" and
"Berserk Bear," has carried out a number of successful hacks in recent
years. In 2017, it targeted a nuclear power plant in Kansas in what
cybersecurity experts refer to as a "watering hole"-type attack -- a
practice where hackers place malicious links on websites frequently
visited by employees. "The group has a history of gaining access and
maintaining access to US and European utility companies, but they don't
do anything with it," Prudhomme said. "They want to have that access
ready at a moment's notice so, if and when they get the order on demand,
they can flip the switch." In 2020, another state-sponsored Russian
group identified by analysts as Cozy Bear, believed to be within
Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, likely orchestrated the
SolarWinds hack. US officials said the group used SolarWinds software to
breach internal email systems at the US Treasury and Commerce
departments, among other key agencies, in what was one of the
largest-ever cyber attacks. But [it's a two-way street]{.underline}.
Experts say that [while it's true Russians are lurking in the software
of various structural areas]{.underline}, [Americans are also lurking in
theirs]{.underline}. [It's the]{.underline} "[cyber equivalent of
**m**utually **a**ssured **d**estruction]{.underline}," said Karen
Walsh, CEO of a cybersecurity firm called Allegro Solutions, using a
term that historically described a philosophy of deterrence during the
nuclear standoff of the Cold War. And the Americans, experts say, are
currently the more capable threat. While Russian cyberattacks tend to
attract headlines, experts told CNN, the most sophisticated hacks are
often carried out in a more professionalized manner by countries such as
the US and Israel, which are good at hiding their tracks. One secret
operation that spilled into public view in 2010 was known as Stuxnet, in
which the US and Israel are widely believed to have jointly sabotaged a
nuclear facility in Iran with a computer virus that temporarily hampered
the country's nuclear program. [Putin]{.underline}, experts say,
[understands the extent of this sophistication and is likely **loath**
to **poke the bear**]{.underline}.

PREVENTING AGGRESSION IN SPACE

While deterrence and the Cold War are strongly linked in the public's
mind through the nuclear standoff between the United States and the
Soviet Union, the fundamentals of deterrence date back millennia and
deterrence remains relevant. Thucydides alludes to the concept of
deterrence in his telling of the Peloponnesian War when he describes
rivals seeking advantages, such as recruiting allies, to dissuade an
adversary from starting or expanding a conflict.6F6 [Aggression in space
was successfully avoided [during the Cold War]{.mark} because [both
sides viewed an attack on]{.mark} military **[sat]{.mark}**ellite[**s**
as]{.mark} highly [escalatory]{.mark}, and such an action would likely
result in general nuclear war]{.underline}.7F7 [[In today's]{.mark}
**more [nuanced]{.mark}** [world, attacking]{.mark} satellites,
including military **[sat]{.mark}**ellite[**s**, does **not**]{.mark}
necessarily [result in nuclear war]{.mark}. For instance, foreign
[countries]{.mark} have [used]{.mark} high-powered [lasers against
American intel]{.mark}ligence-gathering
**[sat]{.mark}**ellite**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}8F8 [[and]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[has
been **reluctant to respond, let alone retaliate** with
**nuc**]{.mark}lear weapon**[s]{.mark}**. This [**shift in policy** is a
result of]{.mark} the [broader]{.mark} use of [gray zone
**op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}**, to which countries struggle to
respond while **[limiting escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Beginning
with the fundamentals of deterrence illuminates how it applies to
prevention of aggression in space.

[[Until **recently**, resilience]{.mark} in space [was]{.mark} largely
[an afterthought]{.mark}. It was assumed that a conflict in space would
likely lead to]{.underline} or precede [a major nuclear
exchange]{.underline}. Therefore, the focus was on cost-effective
architectures that maximized satellite capabilities, often at the cost
of resilience. [Recently, however]{.underline}, some have hoped that
[new architectures could enhance resilience and prevent critical
military operations from being significantly impeded in an
attac]{.underline}k. Although resilience can be expensive, [American
[investments in **smaller sat**]{.mark}**ellite[s]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**more [distributed]{.mark} space [architectures]{.mark}** could
[minimize]{.mark} adversary incentives to carry out [first
strikes]{.mark} in space]{.underline}.

[[In the]{.mark} **late [20th century]{.mark}**[, minor
escalations]{.mark} against space systems [were]{.mark} **treated as
[major events]{.mark}**, since they typically threatened the
superpowers' nuclear architectures. **[Today]{.mark}**, the
**[prolif]{.mark}eration [of counter-space capabilities]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} the **[wide array]{.mark}** of possible types [of attacks
means]{.mark} that **[most]{.mark}** attacks against U.S. space systems
[are **unlikely to warrant a nuclear response**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It
is critical that policymakers understand the likely break points in any
conflict involving space systems. Strategists should explore whether the
characteristics of different types of attacks against space systems
create different thresholds, paying particular attention to attribution,
reversibility, the defender's awareness of an attack, the attacker's
ability to assess an attack's effectiveness, and the risks of collateral
damage (e.g., orbital debris). [[Competitors]{.mark} may attempt to [use
non-kinetic weapons and reversible actions to stay below the
**threshold** that]{.mark} would [trigger a **strong**]{.mark} U.S.
[response]{.mark}]{.underline}. The 2017 National Security Strategy
warns:

> Any harmful interference with or an attack upon critical components of
> our space architecture that directly affects this vital U.S. interest
> will be met with a deliberate response at a time, place, manner, and
> domain of our choosing.

In order to fulfill this promise, [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [will want to ensure that it has capabilities
to respond both above and below various thresholds]{.underline} to
ensure a full-spectrum of deterrence options for the full range of

their]{.underline} own [information]{.underline}, though it took until
2009 for Brazil to crack down on the illegal activity with the support
of the DoD.26 [[In]{.underline}]{.mark} 19**[[98]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
a U.S.-German satellite known as [[ROSAT was rendered

**[minimize]{.mark} the [seriousness]{.mark}** of the

[a]{.mark} U.S. communications **[sat]{.mark}**ellite]{.underline} that

Russian satellite]{.underline}.33 The U.S. company, Iridium, was able to
minimize any loss of service by implementing a network solution within a
few days.34 As of early 2011, no legal action had been taken by the
company either because it is not clear who was at fault or because it
might be politically problematic for the United States, which is trying
to enter into bi-lateral transparency and confidence-building measures
(TCBM) with Russia regarding space activities.35 [Since]{.underline}

multiple GPS jammers]{.underline}---which supposedly did not affect
military GPS functionality. However, [the [U.S.]{.mark} military
[bombed]{.mark} the [jammers]{.mark}]{.underline} anyway after a

In any crisis that threatens to escalate into major power conflict,
political and military [leaders will face **uncertainty** about the
**effectiveness** of their]{.underline} plans and
[decisions]{.underline}. This [[uncertainty]{.mark} will be
[**compounded** when]{.mark} potential [conflict]{.mark} [extends
to]{.mark} the **[space]{.mark}**]{.underline} and cyber
**[domains]{.underline}**, [where **[weapon effectiveness]{.mark}** is
largely]{.underline} untested and **[[uncertain]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[infrastructure **[interdependencies]{.mark}** are
**[unclear]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and [damaging]{.mark} an
**[adversary]{.mark}** [could]{.mark} also **[harm
oneself]{.mark}**]{.underline} or one's allies. Unless the stakes become
very high, [[no country]{.mark} will likely [want to gamble]{.mark} its
well-being in a]{.underline} "**[[single cosmic]{.mark} [throw of the
dice]{.mark}]{.underline}**," in Harold Brown's memorable phrase. 96 The
[[novelty of space]{.underline}]{.mark} and cyber warfare, [coupled with
**[risk aversion]{.mark}** and **worst-case assessments**]{.underline},
could [[lead]{.mark} space [adversaries]{.mark} in[to]{.mark} a
situation of]{.underline} what can be called
"**[hysteresis]{.underline}**," [where each **adversary** is
**[restrain]{.mark}ed** [by]{.mark} its own **[uncertainty]{.mark}** of
success]{.underline}. This is conceptually shown in Figures 1 and 2 for
offensive counter-space capabilities, though it applies more generally.
97 These graphs portray the hypothetical differences between perceived
and actual performance capabilities of offensive counter-space weapons,
on a scale from zero to one hundred percent effectiveness. Where
uncertainty and risk aversion are absent for two adversaries, no
difference would exist between the likely performance of their offensive
counter-space assets and their confidence in the performance of those
weapons: a simple, straight-line correlation would exist, as in
Figure 1. The more interesting, and more realistic, case is notionally
presented in Figure 2, which assumes for simplicity that the [offensive
capabilities of each adversary are **comparable**]{.underline}. In stark
contrast to the case of Figure 1, [**uncertainty** and **[risk
aversion]{.mark}** are present and become [important]{.mark}
factors]{.underline}. Given the high stakes involved in a possible
large-scale attack against adversary space assets, [a **cautious
[adversary]{.mark}** is [more]{.mark} likely to be
**[conservative]{.mark}** in [estimating]{.mark} the effectiveness of
its [offensive]{.mark} [capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, [while **more
[generously]{.mark}** [assessing]{.mark} the **capabilities** of its
**[adversary]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thus, [if **both side's** weapons
were **50% effective**]{.underline} and each side had a similar level of
risk aversion, [each may conservatively assess its **own capabilities**
to be **30% effective** and its **adversary's weapons** to be **70%
effective**]{.underline}. Likewise, if each side's weapons were 25%
effective in reality, each would estimate its own capabilities to be
less than 25% effective and its adversary's to be more than 25%
effective, and so on. In Figure 2, this difference appears, in
oversimplified fashion, as a gap that represents the realistic worry
that a country's own weapons will under-perform while its adversary's
weapons will over-perform in terms of effectiveness. If both countries
face comparable uncertainty and exhibit comparable risk aversion,
[[each]{.mark} may be [**deterred** from]{.mark} [initiating]{.mark} an
[attack]{.mark} by its **[unwillingness]{.mark}** [to **accept**]{.mark}
the **necessary [risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This gap could represent
an "island of stability," as shown in Figure 2. In essence, [given the
**enormous stakes** involved in a major strike against the adversary's
**space assets**]{.underline}, a [potential attacker will **likely
demonstrate** some **risk aversion**]{.underline}, possessing less
confidence in an attack's effectiveness. It is uncertain how robust this
hysteresis may prove to be, but the phenomenon may provide at least some
stabilizing influence in a crisis. In the nuclear domain, the immediate,
direct consequences of military use, including blast, fire, and direct
radiation effects, were appreciated at the outset. Nonetheless,
significant uncertainty and under-appreciation persisted with regard to
the collateral, indirect, and climatological effects of using such
weapons on a large scale. In contrast, the [immediate]{.underline},
[direct effects of major space conflict are **not well
understood**]{.underline}, and potential indirect and interdependent
effects are even less understood. [Indirect effects of **large-scale
space**]{.underline} and cyber [**warfare** would be **virtually
impossible** to confidently **calculate**]{.underline}, as the
infrastructures such warfare would affect are constantly changing in
design and technology. Added to this is a [likely [anxiety]{.mark} that
[if]{.mark} an [attack]{.mark} were **[less successful]{.mark}** than
planned]{.underline}, [a **highly [aggrieved]{.mark}** and **powerful
[adversary]{.mark}** could **[retaliate]{.mark}** in unanticipated
ways]{.underline}, [possibly [with]{.mark} [highly
**destructive**]{.mark} **[consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As a
result, [two adversaries facing potential conflict may **lack
confidence** both in the **potential effectiveness** of their own
attacks and in the ineffectiveness of any **subsequent
retaliation**]{.underline}. Such [[mutual uncertainty]{.mark} would
ultimately be **[stabilizing]{.mark}**]{.underline}, though probably not
particularly robust. This is reflected in Figure 2, where each side
shows more caution than the technical effectiveness of its systems may
suggest. Each curve notionally represents one state's confidence in its
offensive counter-space effectiveness relative to their actual
effectiveness. Until true space asset resilience becomes a trusted
feature of space architectures, deterrence by risk aversion, and
cross-domain deterrence, may be the only means for deterrence to
function in space.

Analysts pointed to Mission Shakti as a vivid example of growing
contestation in the outer space domain. Traditional U.S. dominance in
space has eroded as a litany of [foreign actors]{.underline}
(collaborator and competitor alike) [have increased their spacefaring
prowess, including]{.underline} through the development and use of [ASAT
weapons and]{.underline} dual-use uncrewed orbiters capable of space
**[r]{.underline}**endezvous and **[p]{.underline}**roximity
**[o]{.underline}**peration**[s]{.underline}** \[PDF\]. [Pundits
[fear]{.mark} that]{.underline} such [space technologies could alter the
calculus of deterrence to inauspicious effect or, worse, become
instruments in an adversary's enactment [of]{.mark} a ["space Pearl
Harbor."]{.mark} These fears [are]{.mark}]{.underline} valid in some
senses, [[**overblown** and **misleading**]{.underline}]{.mark} in
others. Developments in space pose significant challenges for strategic
stability. Obsessive concern with the remote contingency of kinetic
warfare in orbit, however, detracts from efforts to address more
pressing space security issues and makes catastrophic outcomes more, not
less, probable.

Missiles and Lasers and Viruses, Oh My

Recent years have witnessed burgeoning democratization in the outer
space domain as plummeting costs---both for manufacturing satellites and
placing them in orbit---and proliferating technologies have enabled new
spacefaring actors to deploy assets in Earth orbit. The number of active
satellites has ballooned to more than two thousand, and their
integration into military operations and civil life has deepened in
tandem. Recognition of the indispensability of these orbital assets to
numerous areas of strategic competition, and defense planners' emphasis
on offensive capabilities as a deterrence measure, has led states to
invest large sums in the development of ASAT weapons of various stripes.

In their April Space Threat Assessment 2019 \[PDF\] report, Todd
Harrison, Kaitlyn Johnson, and Thomas G. Roberts of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies outline four categories of
counterspace operations: kinetic physical attacks, non-kinetic physical
attacks, electronic attacks, and cyberattacks. This litany of potential
threats, which vary in their severity, reversibility, ease of
attribution, and other aspects, makes U.S. policymakers uneasy. After
over half a century of spacefaring pre-eminence, the United States has
come to depend on the remote-sensing, telecommunications, and
positioning, navigation, and timing capabilities that satellites
provide. The resounding defeat of the Iraqi military by American and
coalition forces during the Gulf War of the early 1990s underscored the
substantial battlefield advantages that orbital capabilities confer, and
numerous subsequent conflicts have affirmed the U.S. military's tactical
and strategic reliance on space assets. Proliferating counterspace
systems heighten the potential for adversaries to disrupt American
command, control, and communications networks, as well as surveillance
and reconnaissance operations. In attacking these critical space
systems, U.S. adversaries could compromise large segments of the
national defense enterprise.

Indeed, an insecure orbital environment poses significant challenges for
broader strategic stability. Actors in possession of counterspace
capabilities can threaten or attack vital elements of ballistic missile
launch detection architectures and other systems integral to national
and international security, which opens new avenues for intentional,
inadvertent, or accidental dispute or conflict escalation. In this
sense, novel satellite vulnerabilities add layers of technical and
psychological complexity to already labyrinthine deterrence
calculations. The effect compounds in light of the deep integration of
satellites into information and communications networks: cyber
intrusions into space systems are a tantalizing option for state and
nonstate actors, and such operations carry their own elaborate
deterrence considerations, not least the difficulty of attribution. The
net result is a convoluted deterrence landscape, rife with uncertainty
and in constant motion thanks to the rapid clip and often competitive
character of technological innovation.

Swords of Many Edges

For staunch deterrence advocates, this uncertainty justifies expanding
counterspace arsenals. In their view, preventing a space Pearl Harbor in
which a U.S. adversary launches a crippling surprise attack against
American orbital assets requires evincing the certainty of a devastating
counterattack. One way of accomplishing this is through the unambiguous
demonstration of effective counterspace capabilities. The clearer the
demonstration, the better. In this sense, ASAT missile tests, which are
easy to attribute and spectacular in nature, hold great allure as a
means of signaling orbital strike capabilities.

Such tests, however, come with significant drawbacks. The most obvious
of these is that they generate large amounts of dangerous space debris,
which pose serious hazards to spacecraft. Each new fragment requires
monitoring and, in cases of potential collisions, risk assessment and
avoidance maneuvers. Debris-generating military operations, in this
sense, are a self-defeating proposition. ASAT missile tests also come
with nebulous reputational costs, as the corpus of international space
law, including the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, emphasizes that uses of
space should be peaceful in nature. Likewise, UN Debris Mitigation
Guidelines \[PDF\] affirm the importance of minimizing space junk, a
dictum inconsistent with kinetic weapons testing. Western media heaped
scorn on India for its violation of the important, if incipient, norm
against debris generation, even after the country took pains to destroy
a low-altitude satellite in order to minimize the lifespan of the bulk
of the fragments.

Another important consideration for would-be ASAT testers lies in the
potential for space militarization to ignite or exacerbate international
arms races. Although military activities have been a persistent feature
of the Space Age, those activities have often furthered peaceful as much
as warlike pursuits, as has been the case with many remote-sensing
operations and the opening of the U.S. Global Positioning System to
civilian use. Militarization is a process rather than a state of
affairs, and one that takes various forms at that. Deterrence
implications notwithstanding, the development and deployment of
counterspace capabilities can drive potential adversaries to develop and
deploy similar capabilities, contributing to the erosion of norms of
peaceful use.

Some military planners and policymakers' assertions to the contrary,
space is at present less a domain of warfighting than a domain of deep
interdependence. The value of combat support functions performed from
space, as important as they are to battlefield success, pales in
comparison to that of other satellite-facilitated services, which are
vital to myriad aspects of contemporary global society. Common space
security interests include minimizing debris-generation, coordinating on
satellite placement and radio-frequency spectrum use, monitoring
terrestrial and space weather and the global environment, ensuring the
integrity of global navigation satellite systems, tracking licit and
illicit ground, air, and maritime movements, scanning for hazardous
comets and asteroids, and conducting scientific observations and
experiments. Many of these require states to work together to maximize
benefits and minimize risks. Perceptions that one or more countries are
attempting in systematic fashion to exert dominance and preclude other
actors' access to the domain and its benefits, then, carry significant
dangers. They bend state behavior toward aggression and actual
warfighting.

Security in the Heavens and on Earth

National governments, including that of the United States, should be
careful not to make active contributions to such perceptions. Although
low-level grey zone aggression has become commonplace for space-linked
systems due to the relative ease and reversibility of many cyber and
electronic attacks, space remains free of kinetic combat at present, as
a recent Secure World Foundation report \[PDF\] emphasizes. Rather than
responding to limited attacks by expanding counterspace arsenals, which
carries the risk of contributing to arms race dynamics, U.S. and allied
policymakers should accept some amount of limited aggression as more or
less inevitable. They should place more emphasis on diplomacy---not
weaponry---as a tool in mitigating these sorts of attacks. The United
States should work with other spacefaring powers to reach consensus on
non-binding rules of the road for space, using the International Code of
Conduct for Outer Space Activities \[PDF\] that the European Union
proposed in 2008 as a rough starting point. While new international law
could be a greater boon still, formal UN discussions on the Prevention
of an Arms Race in Outer Space have yielded little progress since the
mid-1980s. A joint Chinese-Russian proposal for a Treaty on the
Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space, for instance, has
significant shortcomings and has drawn open condemnation from the United
States. Such paralysis, in tandem with the Trump administration's and
U.S. Senate Republicans' disdain of multilateral treaties, makes a
formal agreement a farfetched proposition for now.

More important, [U.S.]{.underline} policymakers [should avoid making
decisions on the basis of a possible, though **[highly
improbable]{.mark}**, space Pearl Harbor]{.underline}. They should
recognize that [latent [counterspace capabilities]{.mark}---as
exemplified in]{.underline} 2008's [Operation Burnt Frost, which saw the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [repurpose a ballistic
missile interceptor to destroy a satellite---[are **more than
sufficient** to **deter**]{.mark} adversaries from launching a major
surprise [attack in]{.mark} **almost [all scenarios]{.mark}**[,
especially in]{.mark} light of the aforementioned **[deep
interdependence]{.mark}** in the space domain. [Adding to]{.mark} the
[deterrence]{.mark} effect [are]{.mark} uncertain **offensive [cyber
capabilities]{.mark}**. The **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [continues to launch incursions into
geopolitical competitors' critical systems, such as the Russian power
grid, and has demonstrated a willingness to employ cyberattacks in the
wake of offline incidents, as it did after Iran shot down a U.S.
drone]{.underline} last week. [Unlike in the nuclear arena, where
anything short of the prospect of nuclear retaliation holds limited
dissuasive power, space deterrence can stem from military capabilities
in **various domains**. For this reason, an attack on a U.S. satellite
could elicit any **number of responses**. The potential for
**[cross-domain retal]{.mark}iation**, [combined with]{.mark} the
**[high]{.mark} strategic [value]{.mark}** of space [assets,
means]{.mark} that any [adversary risks **extreme escalation**]{.mark}
in launching a major assault on American space
architectures]{.underline}. Again, well-conceived diplomatic efforts are
useful in averting such scenarios altogether.

[The U.S. depends heavily on military and commercial

### 1NC\-\--ASATs\-\--Taiwan Invasion Defense

#### No Taiwan war\-\--China has pledged to unify since [Mao]{.underline} but has [zero]{.underline} incentive to actually go to war.

**Bush et al. 21**, Richard Bush, former Senior Fellow and Director of
the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution;
Bonnie Glaser, Director of the China Power Project at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies; Ryan Haas, served on the National
Security Council in the Obama administration, Senior Fellow at the
Brookings Institution, "Opinion: Don\'t Help China By Hyping Risk Of War
Over Taiwan," NPR, 04-08-2021,
https://www.npr.org/2021/04/08/984524521/opinion-dont-help-china-by-hyping-risk-of-war-over-taiwan

A growing chorus of officials and experts in the United States has been
raising alarm about the risk of a Chinese attack against Taiwan. Adm.
Philip S. Davidson, the United States Indo-Pacific commander, recently
handicapped the threat of a Chinese assault on Taiwan as \"manifest
during this decade, in fact, in the next six years.\" China is preparing
to invade and unify Taiwan by force, the thinking goes, as soon as it
gains the capabilities to do so. Such [doomsday predictions deserve
interrogation.]{.underline}

[[China\'s actions]{.underline}]{.mark} no doubt have [[earned
scrutiny]{.underline}]{.mark}. In recent years, Beijing has grown
impatiently aggressive in pursuit of its ambitions. China has drawn
blood along the contested Indian border, threatened Vietnam, expanded
its military presence in the South China Sea, increased the tempo of its
operations near the Senkaku Islands and trampled Hong Kong\'s autonomy
--- to say nothing of the atrocities it is perpetrating against its own
citizens in Xinjiang and elsewhere.

Beijing also is investing considerably in military capabilities that
could be employed in a Taiwan contingency. China has gone on a naval
shipbuilding surge in recent years, surpassing the U.S. Navy by a count
of hulls. Robert S. Ross of Boston College estimates that the Chinese
Navy already has more than 300 ships, while the U.S. Navy has around
280.

China is marshaling its full range of capabilities to intensify pressure
on Taiwan below the threshold of conflict. People\'s Liberation Army
forces now operate all around Taiwan. They also have been conducting
highly publicized amphibious assault exercises and air penetrations of
Taiwan\'s air defense identification zone at the highest frequency in
nearly 25 years.

Contributing to Beijing\'s unfriendly treatment of Taiwan was its
perception that the Trump administration showed stronger support for the
island\'s government, thus reducing any incentive that Taipei had to
submit to its demands. Trump officials took initiatives mainly in the
diplomatic and security realms, and they did buoy Taiwan\'s confidence.
The [Biden]{.underline} administration [has shown]{.underline} broad
continuity in [support for Taiwan]{.underline} during its first months.

[As troubling as the trend-lines of Chinese behavior are**, it would be
[a mistake to infer]{.mark}**]{.underline} that **[[they
represent]{.mark} a [prelude to]{.mark} an unalterable
[catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [China\'s]{.underline}]{.mark}
[top [priority]{.mark}]{.underline} now and in the foreseeable future
[is to [deter]{.mark} Taiwan [independence rather than]{.mark} compel
[unification]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[Beijing [remains confident in its
capacity]{.mark} to achieve this]{.underline}** near-term objective,
even as it sets the groundwork for its long-term goal of unification.
Indeed, [[based on polling]{.underline}]{.mark} on attitudes regarding
defense, we believe [the [people]{.mark} of]{.underline}
[Taiwan]{.underline} already [[are sober to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
risks of pursuing [[independence]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[China\'s leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} also have [employed sharp
[rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline}, though [some of it has been
[exaggerated]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Too much is made
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** President **[Xi Jinping\'s
[declaration]{.mark} not to pass down cross-strait divisions to future
generations]{.underline}**. [[Every]{.underline}]{.mark} Chinese
[[leader since Mao]{.underline}]{.mark} Zedong has [[projected]{.mark}
determination [to unify]{.mark} Taiwan]{.underline} with the mainland.
Xi is no different. And Xi, now 67, will not likely be around to see if
Taiwan is unified with the mainland by the putative deadline, the
100-year anniversary of the founding of the People\'s Republic of China
in 2049.

[While it is true]{.underline} that [some in China have
concluded]{.underline} that [time is no longer on China\'s
side]{.underline} and Beijing should use force to compel unification,
[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[resisted]{.mark} such
[pressure]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the latest five-year plan, launched
this year, **[Beijing [reaffirmed]{.mark}]{.underline}** the policy
guideline of pursuing \"**[[peaceful]{.mark} development of cross-strait
[relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" continuing a line tracing back to
the era of Hu Jintao, China\'s president from 2003 to 2013.

[Beijing has]{.underline} its own [incentives to avoid war]{.underline}.
Foremost among them is that [any [attempt]{.mark} to take Taiwan by
force [would]{.mark}]{.underline} very likely
[[invite]{.underline}]{.mark} a [military [conflict with the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}. Such a conflict
would be difficult to limit from escalating or [spreading beyond
the]{.underline} Taiwan [Strait.]{.underline}

Under such circumstances, **[Beijing could [not]{.mark} be [assured
of]{.mark} absolute [victory]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and [[anything
short of quick and absolute unification]{.mark} would risk
**[undermin]{.mark}**ing **[C]{.mark}**hinese]{.underline}
[**[C]{.mark}**ommunist **[P]{.mark}**arty
[legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline} at home. [China\'s [use of
force]{.mark} against Taiwan]{.underline} also [would [poison China\'s
image]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region and the world, [[alert
neighboring countries]{.mark} to the threat China poses]{.underline} to
stability [[and lead to diversion]{.mark} of resources and focus
[from]{.mark} Xi\'s]{.underline} pressing [[domestic
priorities]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Given the unattractiveness of these options, it is little surprise that
China has chosen a different path. In recent years, Beijing has unveiled
a broad range of tools to deter Taiwan\'s independence and gradually
weaken the will of the people of Taiwan to resist integration with the
mainland.

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[targeted]{.mark} Taiwan
[economically]{.mark}, sought to induce]{.underline} a [brain
drain]{.underline} of Taiwan\'s top engineers to the mainland, [isolated
Taiwan]{.underline} on the world stage, [[fomented social
divisions]{.underline}]{.mark} inside Taiwan, [launched cyberattacks and
undertaken displays of military force.]{.underline}

[Beijing\'s goal is to]{.underline} constantly [[remind Taiwan\'s people
of its]{.underline}]{.mark} growing [[power]{.mark}, induce pessimism
about Taiwan\'s future, deepen splits within the island\'s political
system and]{.underline} [show]{.underline} that [outside powers are
impotent to counter its flexes.]{.underline}

Its approach is guided by the Chinese aphorism, \"Once ripe, the melon
will drop from its stem.\" This strategy may require more time than war,
but it would come at less cost and risk to Beijing.

**[[Coercion without violence i]{.mark}s not just a threat; it\'s [an
everyday reality]{.mark}]{.underline}**. China does pose a kinetic
threat to Taiwan, and Taiwan and the United States must strengthen their
capacity to deter war. But [the [proximate threat is]{.mark}
not]{.underline} just [military, it\'s]{.underline} also
[[psychological]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Hyping the threat that China poses to Taiwan does Beijing\'s work for
it. Taiwan\'s people need reasons for confidence in their own future,
not just reminders of their vulnerabilities.

### 1NC\-\--SSA\-\--Space Collisions Defense

**No risk of [accidents]{.underline} -- [tech solves]{.underline} AND
space isn't [crowded]{.underline}.**

**Fernholz '19** \[Tim, \"SpaceX's new satellites will dodge collisions
autonomously (and they'd better),\" May 24,
https://qz.com/1627570/how-autonomous-are-spacexs-starlink-satellites\]

"Within a year and a half, maybe two years, if things go well, SpaceX
will probably have more satellites in orbit than all other satellites
combined," Elon Musk said last week. This is an exaggeration. There are
almost 2,000 operational satellites in space right now. But Thursday
night's launch of 60 satellites for a new internet network called
Starlink is the first step towards that goal. Today, [Musk's space
company said it expects to launch six more times in 2019, with the goal
of operating 720 satellites by the end of the 2020, and eventually more
than 4,000]{.underline}. The Federal Communications Commission---the
lead regulator for American satellites---approved these satellite, among
13,000 new satellites okayed in the last year. [That huge number has
many in the space community nervous about the potential for collisions
with other satellites or with space debris.]{.underline} Neither the
United States nor the world has a reliable system for managing traffic
in space, and policymakers are struggling to keep up with the private
sector's growing ability to hurl computers into the cosmos at faster and
faster rates. [Musk said the [satellite]{.mark}s his company
[**launches** will avoid]{.mark} potential **[collisions on their
own]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And Mark Juncosa, the SpaceX executive in
charge of developing the Starlink satellites, downplayed concerns when
answering press inquiries on the matter last week. "[It might be worth
mentioning for people that are not in the space industry ... **[space is
really big]{.mark}**]{.underline}," he said. It was experts focused on
pinning down what's going on in orbit who questioned whether the
autonomous systems would have sufficient data to safely maneuver. Musk's
electric cars at Tesla often face similar questions. [However advanced
their AI, what's more important is how well the car can
see.]{.underline} The ultimate source for space situational awareness is
the US Air Force's Combined Space Operations Center, or CSpOC, which
tracks orbital objects 10 centimeters in diameter or larger with a
worldwide radar network. [Most **[satellite companies]{.mark}**,
especially those [with **large fleets**, automate]{.mark} the
[**communications** and "station keeping" **maneuvers**]{.mark}. But
[when they receive a **warning**]{.mark} from CSpOC [that there is a
**risk of collision** with]{.mark} another spacecraft or with **space
[debris]{.mark}**]{.underline}, their team consults with the Air Force
to make a decision about how to move. Planet, which operates more than
150 spacecraft, automates its communications with CSpOC and has software
that calculates the probability of potential conjunctions when they
receive a warning. But, [[when the probability]{.mark} of conjunction
[reaches]{.mark} about **[1 in 10,000]{.mark}**, their **[flight
operations]{.mark}** team [step]{.mark}s [in]{.mark} to plan a maneuver
[to keep]{.mark} their [satellites out of trouble]{.mark}]{.underline}.
SpaceX says there will be no human in the loop when it comes to its
satellites. When notified of a potential conjunction with another object
in space, their software will decide whether and how to maneuver, and
communicate that information back to CSpOC. It's not clear what their
threshold will be for taking action, or how much warning they will give
to the US Air Force. CSpOC did not respond to questions about this
communications system. [Satellite **[experts are happy]{.mark}** to see
efforts at automation, because conjunction reports are only going to
increase as more satellites fly]{.underline}. But they worry about an
automated system responding to imperfect data, and emphasize the need
for the widest possible transparency. Though orbital mechanics are
extremely predictable, space sensing is imperfect and the margin of
error around where exactly a satellite can be is quite large. Many
spacecraft operators join the Space Data Association, a trade
association for exchanging space traffic data, and others partner with
new space surveillance companies like LeoLabs to obtain more data about
what's happening in orbit. "Because we look at many hundreds of
satellites every single day, we find that there are issues with the
data," Dr. T.S. Kelso, a former Air Force officer who works for the
Space Data Association, told Quartz. His operation generates about 2,000
conjunction reports every four days. "We can go from something that
looks very serious one day to all of the sudden there is nothing in the
data. ... if you are maneuvering because it is a 1 in 10,000 chance, if
you had done nothing, you still had a pretty good chance nothing was
going to happen." SpaceX isn't responsible for the lack of a real space
traffic management system, but [**as a first mover** among companies
[preparing **ambitious** satellite networks]{.mark} that far outstrip
anything that came before, [it]{.mark} is likely to [set the **tone**
for how operators]{.mark} and regulators
**[interact]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The company chose to fly the
satellites at a low enough altitude that if they fail, they will safely
burn up in the atmosphere within a year, rather than remaining space
junk. "The space junk thing, we don't want to trivialize it or not take
it seriously," Musk said. "\[But\] [**[it's not crowded up
there]{.mark}**. It's extremely sparse. If your goal was [to hit
something]{.mark}, it **[wouldn't be easy]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

What is Kessler Syndrome?

Here's the popular view on Kessler Syndrome. Every once in a while, a
piece of junk in space hits a satellite. This single impact destroys the
satellite, and breaks off several thousand additional pieces. These new
pieces now fly around space looking for other satellites to hit, and so
exponentially multiply themselves over time, like a nuclear reaction,
until a sphere of man-made debris surrounds the earth, and humanity no
longer has access to space nor the benefits of satellites.

It is a dark picture.

[Is Kessler Syndrome likely to happen?]{.underline}

I had to stop everything and spend an afternoon doing back-of-the-napkin
math to know how big the threat is. To estimate, we need to know where
the stuff in space is, how much mass is there, and how long it would
take to deorbit.

[The orbital area around earth can be broken down into four
regions.]{.underline}

[**[Low LEO]{.mark}** - Up to about 400km. [Things]{.mark} that orbit
here [burn up]{.mark} in the earth's atmosphere [quickly]{.mark} -
between a few months to two years]{.underline}. The space station
operates at the high end of this range. It loses about a kilometer of
altitude a month and if not pushed higher every few months, would soon
burn up. [For all practical purposes, Low LEO **doesn't matter** for
Kessler Syndrome. If Low LEO was ever full of space junk, we'd just
wait]{.underline} a year and a half, [and the problem would be
over]{.underline}.

[**[High LEO]{.mark}** - 400km to 2000km. This [where]{.mark} most heavy
satellites and most space [junk orbits]{.mark}]{.underline}. The air is
thin enough here that satellites only go down slowly, and they have a
much farther distance to fall. [It can take 50 years for stuff here to
get down. This is where Kessler Syndrome could be an issue]{.underline}.

[[**Mid Orbit** - **GPS**]{.mark} satellites [and]{.mark} other
**[nav]{.mark}**igation **[sat]{.mark}**ellite**[s]{.mark}** travel
[here]{.mark} in lonely, long lives. The **[volume]{.mark} of space [is
so huge]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} the **[number]{.mark} of satellites [so
few]{.mark}**, that [we **don't**]{.mark} **need to [worry]{.mark}**
about Kessler **[here]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[**GEO** - If you put a satellite far enough out from earth, the speed
that the satellite travels around the earth will match the speed of the
surface of the earth rotating under it]{.underline}. From the ground,
the satellite will appear to hang motionless. Usually the geostationary
orbit is used by big weather satellites and big TV broadcasting
satellites. (This apparent motionlessness is why satellite TV dishes can
be mounted pointing in a fixed direction. You can find approximate south
just by looking around at the dishes in your northern hemisphere
neighborhood.) For Kessler purposes, [[GEO]{.mark} orbit [is]{.mark}
roughly a ring 384,400 km around. However, all]{.underline} the
[**[sat]{.mark}**ellite**[s]{.mark}** here are [moving the same]{.mark}
direction at the same [speed]{.mark} - debris doesn't get free
velocity]{.underline} from the speed of the satellites. [[Also]{.mark},
it's quite expensive to get a satellite here, and so there aren't many,
[only]{.mark} about **[one]{.mark} satellite [per 1000km]{.mark}** of
the ring. Kessler is **[not a problem]{.mark}** here]{.underline}.

How bad could Kessler Syndrome in High LEO be?

Let's [[imagine a **worst case**]{.mark} scenario]{.underline}.

[An evil alien]{.underline} intelligence [chops up everything in High
LEO, turning it into 1cm cubes of death]{.underline} orbiting at 1000km,
[spread]{.underline} as [evenly]{.underline} across the surface of this
sphere as orbital mechanics would allow. [Is humanity cut off from
space?]{.underline}

I'm guessing [the world has launched]{.underline} about [10,000 tons of
satellites total]{.underline}. For guessing purposes, [I'll assume 2,500
tons of satellites]{.underline} and junk [currently in High
LEO]{.underline}. If satellites are made of aluminum, with a density of
2.70 g/cm3, [then that's **839,985,870 1cm cubes**]{.underline}. A
sphere for an orbit of 1,000km has a surface area of 682,752,000 square
KM. So [there would be one cube]{.underline} of junk [per .81 square KM.
If a rocket traveled through that, its [odds of hitting]{.mark} that
cube [are **tiny - less than 1 in 10,000**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

So **[even in the worst case, [we don't lose access]{.mark} to
space]{.underline}**.

Now though you can travel through the debris, you couldn't keep a
satellite alive for long in this orbit of death. [Kessler]{.underline}
Syndrome [at its worst just prevents us from putting satellites in
**certain orbits**]{.underline}.

[[In **real life**]{.mark}, there's [a **lot of factors**]{.mark} that
[make Kessler]{.mark} syndrome **[even less]{.mark} of [a
problem]{.mark}** than our worst case though experiment.]{.underline}

- [[Debris]{.mark} would be [**spread** over]{.mark} a
  **[volume]{.mark}** of space, [not a **single**]{.mark} **orbital
  [surface]{.mark}**[, making collisions **orders of magnitudes less
  likely**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

- [[Most]{.mark} impact debris will [have]{.mark} a **[slower]{.mark}
  orbital [velocity]{.mark}** than either of its original pieces - [this
  makes it deorbit **much sooner**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

- [Any collision will create large and small objects. [Small
  objects]{.mark} are much more affected by atmospheric drag and
  [deorbit]{.mark} faster, even [in]{.mark} a **few [months]{.mark}**
  from high LEO. [Larger objects can be **tracked**]{.mark} by earth
  based radar [and **avoided**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

- [The planned big new [constellations are]{.mark} **not in High LEO**,
  but [in **Low LEO**]{.mark} for faster communications with the earth.
  They **aren't an issue** for Kessler]{.underline}.

- [Most importantly, [all new]{.mark}]{.underline} satellite
  [[launches]{.mark} since the]{.underline} 19[**90's** are required to
  [include a plan to]{.mark} get rid of the satellite at the end of its
  useful life (usually by **[deorbit]{.mark}**ing)]{.underline}

So [the realistic worst case is that **insurance premiums on satellites
go up a bit**. Given the **current trend** toward **much smaller,
cheaper micro satellites**, this wouldn't even have a huge
effect]{.underline}.

I'm removing Kessler Syndrome from my list of things to worry about.

#### It takes [centuries]{.underline} and [adaptation]{.underline} solves

https://www.quora.com/How-quickly-would-it-take-for-the-Kessler-Syndrome-to-destroy-all-the-satellites-in-LEO-And-could-you-see-this-happening-from-Earth

The [dynamics of]{.underline} the [[Kessler]{.underline}]{.mark}
Syndrome [are real]{.underline}, and most people studying it agree on
the concept: if there is sufficient density of objects and mass, a chain
reaction of debris breaking up objects and creating more debris can
occur. [But the **[timescale]{.mark}**]{.underline} of this process
[[takes]{.mark} decades and **[centuries]{.mark}**. There are many
assumptions that go into these models]{.underline}. Though there is
still argument about this, many people in the field think that the
process is already underway in low earth orbit. But others, including
myself, think we can stop it if we take action. [This is [a **slow
motion** disaster]{.mark} that we can prevent]{.underline}.

But [**[in spite of hype]{.mark}** to the contrary, [we will **never**
"lose access]{.mark} to space". [**Certain** missions may become
impractical]{.mark}]{.underline} or too expensive, [and we may decide
that some orbits are too risky]{.underline} for humans. [[**Even that**
depends on]{.mark} the [tolerance]{.mark} for the risk. [But
**robots**]{.mark} don't have mothers, [and]{.mark} if we feel it is
worthwhile **[we will take]{.mark} the [risk]{.mark}** [and fly]{.mark}
the [sat]{.mark}ellite[s]{.mark} where [we need]{.mark} to]{.underline}.

To the specifics of the question, [it will take many decades. **[It will
not destroy all]{.mark} satellites in [LEO]{.mark}**. You won't be able
to see it from the ground]{.underline} unless you were extraordinarily
lucky, and you happened to see a flash from a collision in the instant
you were looking, with just the right lighting.

#### Squo [tracking]{.underline}, [shielding]{.underline}, and [removal]{.underline} plans solve

Dr. Brian **Koberlein 16**, Professor of Physics at the Rochester
Institute of Technology and PhD in Astrophysics from the University of
Connecticut, "Cascade Effect", 5-4,
https://archive.briankoberlein.com/2016/05/04/cascade-effect/index.html

In the movie Gravity the driving force of [the plot is [a]{.mark}
catastrophic [cascade]{.mark} of space debris]{.underline}. An exploding
satellite sends high speed debris into the path of other satellites, and
the resulting collisions create more space debris until everything from
a space shuttle to the International Space Station faces an eminent
threat of destruction. [Not unexpectedly]{.underline}, the movie
portrayal of such a situation [[is not]{.mark} particularly
[accurate]{.mark}]{.underline}, but the risk of a debris cascade is very
real.

It's known as the Kessler syndrome, after Donald Kessler, who first
imagined the scenario in the 1970s. The problem comes down to the fact
that small objects in Earth orbit can stay in orbit for a very long
time. If an astronaut drops a bolt, it can stay in orbit for decades or
centuries. Because the relative speed of two objects in orbit can be
quite large, it doesn't take a big object to pose a real threat to your
spacecraft. On the highway a small pebble can chip your car windshield.
In space it can be done by a chip of paint traveling at thousands of
kilometers per hour. In the history of the space shuttle missions, there
were more than 1,600 debris strikes. Because of such strikes, more than
90 space shuttle windows had to be replaced over the lifetime of shuttle
missions.

[While that might sound alarming, [it's a]{.mark}ctually **quite
manageable**. Upgrades and maintenance were quite common on the shuttle
missions, and we tend to err on the side of caution when it comes to
replacing parts. **[Modern spacecraft]{.mark} also [have ways to
mitigate]{.mark} the [risk]{.mark}** of small impacts, [such as
**Whipple shields**]{.mark} made of thin layers of material spaced apart
so that objects disintegrate when hitting the shield rather than the
spacecraft itself. [We]{.mark} also [have a **tracking system**]{.mark}
that currently tracks more than 300,000 objects bigger than 1 cm, so we
can make sure that most spacecraft avoid these objects.]{.underline}

But the risk of big collisions isn't negligible. [In 2009 the Iridium 33
and Kosmos-2251 satellites collided]{.underline} at high speed,
destroying both spacecraft and creating more dangerous debris. It
wouldn't take many collisions like this for the debris numbers to rise
dramatically, and more debris means a greater risk of collisions. [[In
Gravity]{.mark} the [cascade happens]{.mark} very
[quickly]{.mark}]{.underline}, triggered by a single event. The
[**[reality is not]{.mark} quite [so grave]{.mark}**. Instead of
happening **overnight**, [Kessler]{.mark} syndrome would occur
**gradually**, raising collision risks to the point where certain orbits
become logistically impractical. It could [occur **so
gradually**]{.mark} that [we might **not notice**]{.mark} **it** early
on]{.underline}, and there are some that argue it's already underway.

[The good news is that **[we're aware]{.mark}** of the
threat]{.underline}. And, as the old saying goes, knowing is half the
battle. [[**Already we take steps** to limit]{.mark} the amount of
[debris]{.mark} created. [New]{.mark} space[craft include **end of life
plans**]{.mark} to remove them from orbit]{.underline}, either [by
sending them into Earths atmosphere to burn up, or sending them to a
"graveyard orbit" that poses little risk to other spacecraft. [There
are]{.mark} also [plans]{.mark} on the drawing board [to **clear
orbits**]{.mark} of debris]{.underline}, particularly in low-Earth orbit
where the risk is greatest. [The cascade effect is a real [risk]{.mark},
but it['s]{.mark} also [one we can]{.mark} **likely [manage]{.mark}**
with a bit of ingenuity]{.underline}.

#### [No chance]{.underline} of a short-term solar storm

Miriam **Kramer 18**, MA in Science Reporting from New York University,

The Hype About The Coming Solar Storm", Mashable, 3/13/2018,
https://mashable.com/2018/03/13/solar-storm-hitting-earth/

Perhaps [you\'ve heard; a solar storm is on the way]{.underline}.

If much of the news coverage is to be believed, [the [coming]{.mark}
solar [storm is \"massive\" and]{.mark} could \"[cause]{.mark} power
[outages]{.mark}\" because]{.underline} of [\"equinox
cracks\"]{.underline} that have [appeared in Earth\'s magnetic
field]{.underline}, leaving us vulnerable.

[But that\'s not the full story]{.underline}.

[In fact, [at best]{.mark}, it\'s a **[serious
misunderstanding]{.mark}** of the facts, and [at worse]{.mark}, it\'s a
**[purposeful sensationalization]{.mark}** of a **pretty average** solar
event]{.underline}.

\"**[[This is]{.mark} just [garbage]{.mark}, quite
frankly]{.underline}**,[\"]{.underline} Robert [Rutledge,
of]{.underline} the **[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**ational
**[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**ceanic and
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**tmospheric
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**dministration\'s Space Weather Prediction

solar storm, in an interview. Rutledge went on to say that [he\'s unsure
what \"equinox cracks\" are, and]{.underline} that the [SWPC doesn\'t
use that term]{.underline}.

[[A]{.mark} solar [storm]{.mark} is]{.underline} actually
[[expected]{.underline}]{.mark} to impact the Earth from March 14 to
March 15, [but it **[certainly isn\'t massive]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The storm, known as [a \"G1\"]{.underline} geomagnetic [storm, is
actually the **most minor**]{.underline} of these types of solar storms,
[and [it]{.mark} likely [won\'t create **any**]{.mark}]{.underline} of
the [serious [issues]{.mark}]{.underline} mentioned in many news

**[The [sun is actually]{.mark} pretty [quiet]{.mark} at the

According to the SWPC, [it\'s possible that the solar storm]{.underline}
--- which will occur when charged particles from the sun interacting
with Earth\'s magnetic field --- [will cause \"**[weak]{.mark}** power
grid [fluctuations]{.mark}\" and may have a \"**minor impact** on
satellite operations.\"]{.underline}

[That\'s [a **far cry** from]{.mark} the [serious]{.mark} power

#### No impact to flares or grid collapse

an Electromagnetic Pulse Just Fine", Wired Magazine, 4/30/2019,
https://www.wired.com/story/the-grid-might-survive-an-electromagnetic-pulse-just-fine/

Over the past few years, [speculation has risen around
whether]{.underline} North Korea or any other nation could detonate a
nuclear weapon over the United States that would create [a]{.underline}n
**[e]{.underline}**lectro**[m]{.underline}**agnetic
**[p]{.underline}**ulse and [knock out all electricity for weeks or
months. This doomsday hypothesis has been promoted]{.underline} by a
former CIA director, a commission set up by Congress, and a book by
newsman Ted Koppel. [But [a]{.mark} **sober [new]{.mark} engineering
[study]{.mark}** by industry experts [finds]{.mark} that **[key
equipment]{.mark}** on the grid [can be **protected**]{.mark} from any
such EMP. **[Even if]{.mark}** it could happen, the resulting
[blackouts]{.mark} would [affect a **few states** but **wouldn\'t**
turn]{.mark} the [US into]{.mark} a backdrop for **[The Walking
Dead]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The study, by the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility-funded
research organization, finds that [[existing **tech**]{.mark}nology can
protect various components of the electric grid to **[buffer]{.mark}
it** from the [effects of]{.mark} **solar
[flares]{.mark}**]{.underline}, lightning strikes, and an EMP from a
nuclear blast all at the same time: [a three-for-one **surge
protector**]{.underline}. "We have a strong technical basis for what the
impacts \[of an EMP\] might be," says Randy Horton, EPRI project manager
and author of the report being released today. "That is one thing that
didn't exist before."

Horton says that EPRI technicians worked with experts at the Department
of Energy labs at Los Alamos and Sandia to simulate some effects of an
EMP on substations and distribution systems. [They]{.underline} also
[did **real-world testing**]{.underline} of electrical equipment at an
EPRI laboratory in Charlotte, North Carolina. The study, which took
three years to complete, looks at the effects of three kinds of energy
spawned by a nuclear detonation.

The first high-energy wave occurs in just a few nanoseconds and is
called an E1. The second wave, called an E2, lasts up to a second and
can fry electric systems the way a lightning strike does, unless they
are properly grounded. Effects of an E2 wave on the grid are expected to
be minimal. The third kind of wave can last for tens of seconds and is
similar to what utility operators might expect from a low-frequency,
long-duration solar flare or geomagnetic storm. The report says that the
combination of an E1 and E3 would cause the most damage over the widest
area.

Horton says **[simulations and [testing]{.mark}]{.underline}** by EPRI
[**[contradicts]{.mark} earlier [findings that]{.mark} an [EMP]{.mark}
would [wipe out the]{.mark} US [grid]{.mark}**. "You could have a
regional voltage collapse, but [you **wouldn't damage**]{.mark} **a
[large number of]{.mark} bulk power** [transformers
**immediately**]{.mark},"]{.underline} Horton says. "That was the
difference in our finding. There were some studies that said you could
damage hundreds of transformers. We just didn't find it."

Some members of an EMP commission have argued for the past decade that
an attack would destroy the electric grid, and kill 90 percent of the US
population through disease or starvation. That panel shut down in 2017
after the Department of Homeland Security did not request more funds
from Congress to keep it going.

Apart from the electric power industry, the Pentagon has been conducting
its own classified tests about potential effects from such an event on
military installations. A group of experts is meeting this week at
Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama, says Air Force
lieutenant-general Steven Kwast, who is coordinating the event.

Kwast says the threat is much more real than the public believes. "You
don't need to have a nuclear detonation in space to do this," he said.
"You could have a hot-air balloon rising above a city with a tactical
electromagnetic weapon. You could do one over an airfield of F-35s or
one Army post so none of the tanks work or over a shipyard so that none
of the ships sail. Our enemy is clever and adaptive. They see our soft
underbelly is our electricity."

But other nuclear weapons experts say [the [technical
study]{.mark}]{.underline} by EPRI [[brings]{.mark} **scientific
[rigor]{.mark}** [to a field]{.mark} that has been [dominated by
**hype**]{.mark} and **fearmongering**. "When you are doing documented
research on physical systems, it is still **solid evidence**, no matter
who paid for it,"]{.underline} says Sharon Burke, a senior adviser at
the Foundation for a New America and a former assistant secretary of
defense for operational energy in the Obama administration. ["This is
[not someone's **opinion**]{.mark}."]{.underline}

### 1NC\-\--SSA\-\--Kessler Defense

#### Kessler Syndrome false -- less debris and existing guidelines solve 

**Lewis 15** (Hugh, Senior Lecturer in Aerospace Engineering at the

unreasonable expectation of certainty." Room,
<https://room.eu.com/article/Space_debris_Kessler_Syndrome_and_the_unreasonable_expectation_of_certainty>,
Accessed 8/10/19, JMoore)

There is now widespread awareness of the space debris problem amongst
policymakers, scientists, engineers and the public. Thanks to pivotal
work by J.C. Liou and Nicholas Johnson in 2006 we now understand that
the continued growth of the debris population is likely in the future
even if all launch activity is halted. The reason for this sustained
growth, and for the concern of many satellite operators who are forced
to act to protect their assets, are collisions that are expected to
occur between objects -- satellites and rocket stages -- already in
orbit. [In spite of]{.underline} several commentators
[warning]{.underline} that these collisions are just the start
[of]{.underline} a collision cascade that will render access to low
Earth orbit all but impossible -- a process commonly referred to as the
'[**[Kessler]{.mark}** Syndrome']{.underline} after the debris scientist
Donald Kessler -- [the reality [is not]{.mark} likely to be on the scale
of these predictions or the events depicted in **[the film
Gravity]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Indeed, [results presented by the
Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee
(**[IADC]{.mark}**)]{.underline} at the Sixth European Conference [on
Space Debris [show an expected increase]{.mark} in the debris population
[of]{.mark} only [30% after **200 years** with continued launch
activity. **Collisions**]{.mark} are still predicted to occur, but this
is [far from]{.mark} the **[catastrophic scenario]{.mark}** feared by
some.]{.underline} [[Constraining]{.underline} [the]{.underline}]{.mark}
population [[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} to a modest level [[can be
achieved]{.underline}]{.mark}, the IADC suggested,
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} widespread and good compliance with
[**[existing]{.mark}** space debris **[mitigation
guidelines]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially those relating to
passivation (whereby all sources of stored energy on a satellite are
depleted at the end of its mission) and post-mission disposal, such as
de-orbiting the satellite or re-orbiting it to a graveyard orbit.
Nevertheless, the anticipated growth of the debris population in spite
of these robust efforts merits the investigation of additional measures
to address the debris threat, according to the IADC.

[According to]{.underline} these [activists and

[[catastrophes]{.mark} that could [kill]{.mark} off
**[civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and maybe even our species. [Are
they right?]{.underline} [[**Absolutely** **not**]{.underline}]{.mark},
answers the longtime environmental activist Michael Shellenberger in an
engaging new book, Apocalypse Never: Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us
All. \"[Much of what people are being told about the
**environment**]{.underline}, including the climate, [is
**wrong**]{.underline}, and we desperately need to get it right,\" he
writes. \"I decided to write Apocalypse Never after getting fed up with
the exaggeration, alarmism, and extremism that are the enemy of
positive, humanistic, and rational environmentalism.\" While fully
acknowledging that significant global environmental problems exist,
Shellenberger argues that [[they do not **constitute**]{.mark}
inexorable **[existential threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Economic
**[[growth and tech]{.mark}nological progress]{.underline}**, he says,
can [[**ameliorate** them]{.underline}]{.mark}. Shellenberger\'s
[analysis relies on largely **uncontroversial mainstream
science**]{.underline}, [including reports from the]{.underline}
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC]{.underline}) [and the
Food and Agriculture Organization]{.underline}. And as a longstanding
activist, Shellenberger is in a good position to parse the motives
behind the purveyors of doom. Shellenberger\'s activism is the real
deal. To raise a donation to the Rainforest Action Network, he charged
his friends \$5 to attend his 16th birthday party. At 17 he went to
Nicaragua to experience the Sandinista revolution. In the 1990s he
worked with the Landless Workers\' Movement in Brazil. In 2003,
Shellenberger and allies launched the New Apollo Project to jumpstart a
no-carbon energy revolution over the next 10 years. In 2008, Time named
him \"A Hero of the Environment.\" He co-founded the ecomodernist
Breakthrough Institute, which advocates the use of advanced technologies
such as nuclear power and agricultural biotechnology to decouple the
economy from the ecology, allowing both humanity and the natural world
to flourish. More recently, he founded Environmental Progress, which
campaigns for, among other things, the deployment of clean modern
nuclear power. He is an invited expert reviewer of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change\'s next assessment report. So what does he say
about climate change? \"On behalf of environmentalists everywhere, I
would like to formally apologize for the climate scare we created over
the last 30 years,\" he wrote in an essay to promote his new book.
\"[[Climate change]{.mark} is happening]{.underline}. [It\'s just [not
the **end of the world**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It\'s not even our most
serious environmental problem.\" Needless to say, there are
environmentalists everywhere who do not believe they have anything to
apologize for. A group of six researchers assembled by the widely
respected Climate Feedback fact-checking consortium rated his article as
having low scientific credibility. Shellenberger doesn\'t devote much of
Apocalypse Never to the science behind man-made climate change. He
basically accepts the consensus that it\'s a significant problem and
instead focuses on various claims about the harms it is supposedly
already causing. In that promotional essay, he argues that (1)
[[human]{.mark} being are **[not causing]{.mark}** a \"sixth
mass]{.underline} **[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" (2) the
[Amazon rainforests]{.underline} are [not]{.underline} the \"**[lungs of
the world]{.underline}**,\" (3) [climate change is not making **natural
disasters worse**]{.underline}, and (4) [fires have **declined 25
percent**]{.underline} around the world [since **2003**.]{.underline}
Shellenberger isn\'t denying the reality of man-made climate change.
He\'s arguing that [[humanity]{.mark} is **already
[adapting]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the ways climate change has been
making weather patterns evolve, [and]{.underline} that [we [will
continue to **adapt**]{.mark} successfully in the future]{.underline}.
His book is ultimately a sustained argument that poverty is world\'s
most important environmental problem, and [that rising

to [extend]{.mark} its **[collective defense]{.mark}** principles
[to]{.mark} outer [space]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to the NATO's
overarching Space Policy that was made public on Monday. \"At the 2021
Brussels Summit, [[Allies]{.mark} [agre]{.mark}ed that
[attacks]{.mark}]{.underline} to, from, or [with[in]{.mark}
[space]{.mark} [present]{.mark} a **clear [challenge]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} the [security]{.mark} of the Alliance]{.underline}, [the
impact]{.underline} of which could [**threaten** national and
Euro-Atlantic **prosperity**]{.underline}, **[security]{.underline}**,
[and **stability**]{.underline}, and could be as harmful to modern
societies as a conventional attack. [Such [attacks]{.mark} could [lead
to]{.mark} the **[invocation]{.mark}** [of Article
5]{.mark}]{.underline}. A decision as to when such attacks would lead to
the invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council
on a case-by-case basis,\" the document reads. According to the
document, [NATO plans to **incorporate** space into the system of
**collective** security and **defense**]{.underline}. \"Space is an
inherently global environment and any conflict that extends into space
has the potential to affect all users of space. Even in cases where NATO
is not involved in conflict, Allies' space systems could be affected,\"
it says. [[NATO]{.mark} [pledges]{.mark} [to carry]{.mark} [out]{.mark}
its [activities]{.mark} in outer space with[in]{.mark} the
**[framework]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **[i]{.mark}nternational
[law]{.mark}**]{.underline}. \"[The free access]{.underline},
exploration [and use of outer space for **peaceful purposes** is in the
**common interest** of **all nations**]{.underline}. NATO and Allies
will continue to carry out all activities in outer space in accordance
with international law, including the UN Charter, in the interest of
maintaining international peace and security and promoting international
cooperation and understanding,\" the document reads. Apart from that,
according to the strategy, [NATO has **no plans** to become an
**autonomous actor** in outer space]{.underline}. \"NATO is not aiming
to become an autonomous space actor. NATO will seek to complement and
add value to the work of Allies and to engage with other relevant
international organisations,\" it says.

[[NATO]{.mark}'s [attempts]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [solve]{.mark}
[refugee]{.mark} crise[s]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[fight
wars]{.underline}]{.mark} far from Europe, [[and]{.mark}
[counter]{.mark} [Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline} ambitions for
[[heg]{.mark}emony]{.underline} would be **[[destined]{.mark} [to
fail]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [NATO would fail [due to]{.mark}
**[lacking]{.mark} [unified]{.mark} [commitment]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[**[not]{.mark}** from a **[faulty]{.mark} [strat]{.mark}egic
analysis**]{.underline} (Morcos, 2020). At present, NATO has 30 members.
[There [can be]{.mark} **[no]{.mark} broad [commitment]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} [defense]{.mark} [without]{.mark} **[unity]{.mark}** in
cause]{.underline}. For example, it is apparent that the [most recent
country to join NATO]{.underline}, [[North]{.mark}
[Macedonia]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[has]{.mark} **[separate]{.mark}
[incentives]{.mark}** [then]{.mark}]{.underline} its [partner
member]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. Nonetheless, North Macedonia, like
all other countries of NATO, has interest in keeping Russia's
nationalistic ambitions out of their country. Although new nation-states
have emerged, the same geographical regions highlighted in the Cold War
are relative today. Indeed, many nations that exist today were once
formally a part of the Soviet Union. Thus, returning to the original
purpose of NATO is as valid today as it was in 1949.
[[Solidifying]{.mark} **[resolve]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[unifying]{.mark}** on a **common course** is the [best way]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [return]{.mark} NATO's [prominence]{.mark}]{.underline}. It
is important to note there were disagreements between members of NATO
when combating the Warsaw Pact; however, mutual interest kept the
alliance alive. This same mutual interest exists today within the
revival of Russian aggression. Johnston et al. (2019) conjectured that
"the degree to which NATO endures or indeed thrives appears to be a
function of the continued relevance of the old security agenda." NATO
exists today to deter Russia's unethical foreign ambitions, but
[membership **[commitment]{.mark}** is [**necessary** to]{.mark}
[meet]{.mark} the **[demands]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the strategic
[environment]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### 1NC\-\--Solvency\-\--Article 5 Key

#### Clarification of article V is key

David H. **Ucko 10**, adjunct fellow at the Department of War Studies,
King\'s College London\"Resetting Article 5: Toward a New Understanding
of NATO\'s Security Guarantees\", World Politics Review,
https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/6838/resetting-article-5-toward-a-new-understanding-of-natos-security-guarantees

For all this, [the [alliance]{.mark} badly [needs]{.mark} a
[**clarification** of]{.mark} its [collective security
mech]{.mark}anism, for, though its current **[ambiguity may fool]{.mark}
prospective [adversaries, it]{.mark} really [should not fool NATO
itself]{.mark}.** There is a need]{.underline}, in other words, [to
chart a **middle path** between traditionalists and revolutionaries,
whereby NATO **maintains a solidarity** clause but comes to a new,
**narrower** and shared understanding of its meaning and implications.
The point would be to [downgrade]{.mark} the [expectations]{.mark} that
come with NATO membership [by **talking more honestly**]{.mark},
**[within NATO]{.mark}**, [about what the alliance is]{.mark}
[**likely** and **able** to commit to.]{.mark}]{.underline}

First, [it would be necessary to convey, **in private**, to members that
**an Article 5 response** is not automatic, but is rather the product of
intensely **political processes** within each NATO state, and that even
if a response is forthcoming, there is no way of guaranteeing that it
will be timely or particularly effective. The language of an
**unflinching**, **immediate**, collective and effective response may be
appropriate for **audiences outside of NATO**, but not for **internal
discussion.** Within the alliance, **[less grandstanding]{.mark}
rhetoric** [and **greater transparency** would]{.mark} [reduce]{.mark}
the scope for [**obfuscation**. The **language of collective security**
would **remain**]{.mark} \-- for symbolic reasons, **[for the deterrent
role]{.mark}** that Article 5 still plays and for the foundation it
provides for retaliatory action. But the point would be to
**re-emphasize** within the alliance the oft-forgotten provision of
Article 5 whereby each member takes only **\"such action as it deems
necessary\"** when fulfilling its security obligations.]{.underline}

Second, [[NATO would]{.mark} need to **[delineate]{.mark}** much more
clearly [**what types of threats** it is capable of countering]{.mark}.
No doubt [a **nontraditional attack** can be]{.mark} as
[devastating]{.mark} as a military strike, but it does not follow that
NATO is equally prepared to handle both. The decision regarding NATO\'s
role in any incident must be based not only on the severity of a
potential attack, but also on **NATO\'s ability** to mount an effective
response.]{.underline} Whereas the language of solidarity following the
Sept. 11 attacks was certainly appropriate, a case can be made that NATO
ultimately overextended itself in invoking Article 5. The invocation
established a dangerous precedent for the kinds of threats that the
article might cover, many of which NATO lacks the expertise to deter, to
forestall or to counter. [[Talking loudly]{.mark} about collective
defense against non-traditional attacks **[without]{.mark} a concomitant
[ability to deliver]{.mark}** when they occur [is likely to provoke a
**crisis of credibility**]{.mark} for the alliance.]{.underline}

[Similar [**gaps between expectations and capabilities**
surround]{.mark} the issue of **[cybersecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline},
which Secretary-General Rasmussen recently suggested should be covered
by Article 5, as well as [**energy-security threats** and **economic
warfare**: NATO undoubtedly has a role to play in protecting its members
from these potentially very harmful forms of attack, yet until the
capability is created, it may want to **interpret** its **security
guarantees** more **narrowly**. This also raises the question of [how
serious an attack in a **nontraditional domain**]{.mark} [would need to
be to **trigger Article 5**]{.mark} considerations. Some informal
[**criteria** would]{.mark} need to [be agreed upon]{.mark} to inform
expectation, yet clearly this is also something that would need to be
settled [**behind closed doors**,]{.mark} so as not to invite attack and
provocation **under the established threshold** or precisely where
NATO\'s guarantees are the weakest.]{.underline}

Naturally, the prospect of agreeing within NATO to a more honest but
weaker Article 5 regime will elicit much support among those who rely
most on NATO\'s security guarantees. Nonetheless, [**greater
[transparency is preferable to false hope]{.mark}**. A hardnosed
**stocktaking** of what NATO can and cannot do would also provide for a
more promising foundation on which progress could be made: a **common
appraisal** of problems faced and a **framework for finding limited
solutions**, where possible. This would also [allow]{.mark} those
[nations that feel]{.mark} most [vulnerable to **make their own security
arrangements**]{.mark}, even if that means seeking relationships outside
the alliance structure]{.underline}. In the event that such arrangements
are inimical to NATO\'s interests, the onus would then be on the
alliance itself to provide a preferable alternative. In that sense,
[**greater transparency** would make the self-interest of individual
members the foundation of NATO\'s collective defense mechanism, rather
than the need to ensure the alliance\'s solidarity or prove its
relevance, the reasons most often used to justify Article 5 security
guarantees today but whose rhetorical appeal rarely translates into
action.]{.underline}

[Upholding a security regime that is limited, patchy and short on
substance is far from ideal, yet it would **accurately** reflect the
alliance\'s current **intentions**, **capabilities** and **political
will**. So long as both those making the promise of collective defense
and those hoping to take it up are **mutually aware of its true
possibilities and very real limitations**, it may be the **least-bad**
and most-viable way out of an **awkward situation.**]{.underline}

#### Without clarifying definitions, the plan is useless

Christopher **Woody 18**, Washington, DC-based editor covering military
and defense issues and foreign affairs." NATO leaders are worried about
cyberattacks, but it\'s not clear they all agree on what that means,"
Business Insider, 10/1/18,
https://www.businessinsider.com/nato-leaders-agree-cyberattacks-are-threat-but-cant-agree-definition-2018-10

[[NATO]{.mark} leadership appears to be in [agree]{.mark}ment that
cyberattacks and forms of [hybrid war]{.mark}fare that involve it [are
a]{.mark} **growing [threat]{.mark}** to]{.underline} [the alliance,
[but it\'s]{.mark} still [not]{.mark} totally [clear how]{.mark} its
[members **define**]{.mark} and]{.underline} **[evaluate]{.underline}**
[[that threat]{.mark}, and that raises questions about **how they\'ll
respond** to an attack.]{.underline}

[In late 2014]{.underline} --- several months [after the Russian
annexation of Crimea and incursion into Ukraine]{.underline} --- [NATO
leaders agreed that a large-scale cyberattack on one member **could be
considered an attack on the entire alliance**]{.underline}, potentially
leading to a military response.

\"Today we declare that cyber defense is part of NATO\'s core task of
collective defense\" NATO\'s secretary general at the time, Anders Fogh
Rasmussen, said of the decision.

The emphasis on the cyber realm grew considerably in 2017.

At the beginning of that year, NATO announced plans to spend more than
\$3 billion to upgrade its satellite and computer technology over three
years, including some \$900 million on computer systems that help
command air and missile defenses and \$80 million to improve protection
against cyberattacks at NATO\'s 32 main locations.

At the end of that year, NATO announced plans to increase its
cyber-defense capabilities, adapting its command structure to integrate
cyber weapons into its military operations in what one of the
alliance\'s former cyber-defense advisers called one of the
organization\'s biggest policy changes in years.

[Cyberattacks, along with other forms of hybrid warfare that fall short
of open combat, have complicated things for]{.underline}
[NATO]{.underline}, current Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in
September.

With cyber operations, Stoltenberg said, \"it\'s very hard to tell
exactly who attacked you. It\'s very hard to say exactly where it takes
place.\"

\"So we live in a \... completely different security environment with a
more blurred line between peace and war,\" he added.

In an interview on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York
City, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez echoed that view.

\"In my opinion, cybersecurity, a fight against hybrid wars or
strategies, is one of the major challenges for NATO,\" Sanchez said
during an interview with Reuters, adding that the alliance needs to
remain vigilant on its eastern and southern frontiers as well.

[[Despite]{.mark} the **growing [focus]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**increased [spending]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[NATO\'s]{.mark}
[response]{.mark} to cyber threats appears to have a problem with
**definitions**]{.underline} --- [namely, **what constitutes an attack**
and how severe it]{.underline} is.

In late 2017, after officials from France, NATO, and the EU offered
several widely varying tallies of cyberattacks in 2016, Stefan Soesanto,
a former cybersecurity and defense fellow at the European Council on
Foreign Relations, asked their agencies to ask what incidents were
included in their totals and if their standards were public, receiving
no response or no comment from each.

\"But [[without]{.mark} published **[standards]{.mark}** and
**discernable metrics**,]{.underline} such [[warnings]{.underline}
**[are of no]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[real
[value]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to the public]{.underline},\" Soesanto
wrote for Defense One in September.

\"We simply do not know whether 6,000 annual attacks against NATO\'s
infrastructure is a lot or whether any of the 24,000 attacks against the
French \[Ministry of Defense\] were serious,\" Soesanto added. \"All we
know is that something was counted by someone somehow to somewhat
explain the threat environment.\"

Further inquiry found that [even **within countries**]{.underline},
**[different agencies]{.underline}** [had]{.underline} **[different
definitions]{.underline}** [for what constituted a cyberattack and
different ways of determining their severity.]{.underline}

[This [**incoherence** creates]{.mark} **several
[problems]{.mark}**,]{.underline} according to Soesanto.

[The [lack of a **unifying standard** will lead public officials to
**over**- and **under-state**]{.mark} such [incidents]{.mark},
which]{.underline} in turn [undermines]{.underline} the public\'s
[ability to understand the threat]{.underline}.

[A **lack of cohesion**]{.underline} also [[hinders]{.mark}
cyber-[defense efforts **within** and **between** governments,]{.mark}
and,]{.underline} perhaps most important, **[muddies the rules of
engagement.]{.underline}**

\"[[NATO]{.mark} [member s]{.mark}tates [are]{.mark} embroiled in
[discussing]{.mark} **[cyber deterrence
frameworks]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[offensive
op]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[eration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[[and]{.underline} **[creating norms]{.underline}**]{.mark} and rules
[for state behavior in cyberspace, [they have]{.mark} **still [not
reached consensus on how to actually]{.mark} count and [categorize cyber
incidents across the alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" Soesanto writes.

Altering the Calculus of Deterrence [Assuming]{.underline} that
[[states]{.mark} will behave as **rational** actors when **contemplating
attacks** in space, they will [conclude on]{.mark} maintaining [security
when]{.mark} their [calculations favor]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**[avoidance of risk]{.mark}** instead of]{.underline} seeking [the
benefit of aggression. To influence]{.underline} these [calculations,
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [must deny the
benefit]{.underline} of an attack [and make sure]{.underline} that
[adversaries are **aware** that any benefits would be **insignificant**
compared to]{.underline} the [anticipated response. The
N]{.underline}ational [S]{.underline}ecurity [S]{.underline}pace
[S]{.underline}trategy [calls for]{.underline} this [deterrence by
denial]{.underline} approach [by "[strengthening]{.mark} the
**[resilience]{.mark}** of our architectures" and use of
**cross-domain** solutions to maintain capabilities in the event of an
attack]{.underline}.71 [Such methods]{.underline} generally
[deny]{.underline} the benefits of an [attack by adding redundancy,
which [is]{.mark} **extremely [costly]{.mark}** to achieve [and]{.mark}
ultimately **[aggravates]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [**concerns** of

[[these]{.mark} strengthening]{.underline} and cross-leveling

[Reliance on]{.mark}]{.underline} the current [**passive
[safeguards]{.mark}** such as systems hardening]{.underline}, system
[dispersal, and maneuvers [amounts to]{.mark} **maintaining [the
s]{.mark}tatus [quo]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 72 In reality, [these
efforts]{.underline} generally prevent the consequences of an attack
from becoming devastating; they [do not]{.underline} necessarily [deny
benefits]{.underline} of objective [to the adversary. Redundancy may not
be the best approach]{.underline}. Demonstrations, military exercises,
as well as technical analyses can effectively display to potential
adversaries that aggressive actions will not afford them their desired
asymmetric military advantage. While such efforts reduce the
consequences of a potential attack, the effort must focus on increasing
the effectiveness of the deterrence strategy. [Effective [deterrence
begins with]{.mark}]{.underline} a firmer **[declaratory
[policy]{.mark}]{.underline}** [that works in **[reducing
miscalc]{.mark}ulation** by ensuring those]{.underline} that are
[contemplating aggressive actions in space **perceive the costs**
resulting from those actions as **prohibitive**]{.underline}.73
[[Without]{.mark} these **[clear limits]{.mark}** denoting]{.underline}
the framework of [escalation, [others might **not understand**]{.mark}
the deterrent]{.underline} message.74 Declarations regarding the right
to respond to aggression in space provide the first step in a process
that must ensure that potential aggressors understand the nation's
resolve to respond to aggressive acts in space.

Challenges

Of course, [there are]{.underline} [**legitimate reasons** why
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has
not **actualized** more defense]{.underline} space
[partnerships]{.underline}. Part of this stems from the legacy of the
Cold War in which the United States and the Soviet Union were the two
major powers in space. A RAND report from 2000 says, "Historically, the
predominance of U.S. investment in and experience with space systems has
minimized the consideration of space as an area with potential
interoperability problems," noting that "the United States has provided
the bulk of products and services derived from space assets."28 Because
the United States had overwhelming capabilities in space relative to
allies, little could be gained by defense space partnerships. Nowadays,
it is rare to hear arguments against collaborating in the defense space
domain. But there are deceptively simple yet significant obstacles in
the way of realizing more defense space collaboration. Among these are
classification and releasability of information; technology and
logistics; and organizational issues. Although the mindset has changed
around defense space partnerships, these mundane challenges will need to
be addressed for the United States to establish more and deeper space
partnerships.

Classification Levels and Releasability.

[No issue]{.underline} [presents a **greater impediment**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} defense space [partnerships than an
**inability**]{.underline} [to **share information**]{.underline}. In
conversations with allied attachés and exchange officers,
**[classification]{.underline}** [and **releasability**]{.underline}
routinely [came up as the **biggest obstacle**]{.underline} [they
perceived]{.underline} [to more]{.underline} **[effective]{.underline}**
[security space]{.underline} [collaboration]{.underline}. We need to
protect information that helps the United States maintain its advantage,
but it is possible to overdo secrecy, and we should continuously
evaluate the classification and releasability of information in the
space domain to better balance secrecy with collaboration.29 Defense
space information is frequently classified and often with a NOFORN (not
releasable to foreign nationals) caveat. [Such
classification]{.underline} or dissemination [control
**limits**]{.underline} [defense **space collaboration**]{.underline}.
For example, a foreign partner could share sensing data with the United
States, which is then processed through NOFORN software and made
unavailable to the very country that captured it.

This issue has received attention at senior levels. General John Hyten
has stated the need to remove NOFORN designations where possible.30 In
2019, then Air Force Chief of Staff, General David Goldfein said with
respect to space collaboration: "One of the challenges we have is that
we over-classify things and that gets in the way of information
sharing."31 The Air Force is currently implementing a security
classification review looking to improve information sharing for space
operations. The [experts]{.underline} we spoke with [**noted**
that]{.underline} although the United States has been making progress in
this area, **[classification]{.underline}** [remains a **major
obstacle**]{.underline} for defense space partnerships.

Compatibility in Standards and Technology.

[Defense]{.underline} space [partnerships]{.underline} [present
**logistical hurdles**]{.underline} [for sharing]{.underline}
[information too]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} [not having
**compatible systems**]{.underline} and standards. Even in cases where
U.S. officials are permitted to share sensitive information with
partners, [experts]{.underline} we [spoke]{.underline} with pointed out
[that]{.underline} the United States and the [partner
country]{.underline} [often]{.underline} **[cannot
collaborate]{.underline}** [because]{.underline} [they do not have the
same]{.underline} or compatible [**classified**
conferencing]{.underline} **[capabilities]{.underline}** or networks.
The DOD's classified SIPRnet Secret-level computer network, for
instance, was not designed to be a combined or allied system.32 In some
cases, defense space partnerships also require allies to align their
standards, such as for data. [In]{.underline} **[s]{.underline}**pace
**[s]{.underline}**ituational **[a]{.underline}**wareness data sharing,
[for instance]{.underline}, **[government]{.underline}**, industry, [and
**international organizations**]{.underline} [have been adopting
**various standards**]{.underline} [for]{.underline}
[sharing]{.underline} orbital [information]{.underline}, [which is
requiring **complex**]{.underline} data [translation]{.underline}
[services]{.underline} or [**preventing sharing**
altogether]{.underline}.

Organizational.

[Another challenge]{.underline} [is that with the]{.underline} **[myriad
of organizations]{.underline}** in the U.S. government [that work on
**defense**]{.underline} [space]{.underline}
**[partnerships]{.underline}** [and sharing]{.underline}, [it is not
easy for allies]{.underline} [to know]{.underline} **[whom to talk
to]{.underline}**. [Roles]{.underline} and responsibilities [are
**spread out** across the]{.underline} **[D]{.underline}**epartment
**[o]{.underline}**f **[D]{.underline}**efense, [the]{.underline}
**[I]{.underline}**ntelligence **[C]{.underline}**ommunity,
[the]{.underline} **[D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[S]{.underline}**tate, and others, [and there is no
**single**]{.underline} clear [**entry point** for partners]{.underline}
or potential partners [to **engage**]{.underline}. The U.S. Space Force
headquarters could be the entry point for training and exercises, U.S.
Space Command for space operations collaboration, Office of the Director
of National Intelligence for intelligence sharing, the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency for imagery sharing and training, Space
and Missile Command for combined space system acquisition, the Office of
the Secretary of Defense for broader discussions. This issue surfaced in
our discussions with allied attachés and foreign exchange officers. One
official from a partner nation offered an anecdote in which an official
from a separate nation called for help because he was unable to connect
with the right people on the U.S. side. [Many said that
**navigating**]{.underline} [the **"U.S. space behemoth,"**]{.underline}
as one official put it, [and knowing whom]{.underline} [to **contact**
is]{.underline} extremely **[challenging]{.underline}**.33 Figure 1

space collaboration.

While the United States' announcement that it would contribute its
capabilities could help lend credibility to NATO's cyber deterrence,
further [[clarification]{.mark} is **[needed]{.mark}** with[in]{.mark}
NATO]{.underline}, particularly [when it comes to its **[command

[threat]{.mark} [perceptions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and face]{.mark}
[issues of]{.mark} **[cohesion]{.mark}** and **trust**]{.underline},
[[could agree]{.mark} on effective response scenarios in a crisis

[[critical]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[because]{.mark} **[cyber]{.mark}
operations** will be [subject]{.mark} [to]{.mark} **political
[approval]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} the **NATO
[allies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The new Cyber Operations Center, which
should be fully operational in 2023, could play an important role in
that respect, but the lack of operational authority may pose a
significant challenge.37 According to NATO, the center aims to
"strengthen cyber defenses and integrate cyber capabilities into NATO
planning and operations."38 But as the U.S. declaration on its potential
cyber support to NATO confirms, it appears at this point that the center
will serve to coordinate rather than oversee operations.
[This]{.underline}, [[**coupled** with]{.mark} allies'

Furthermore, even before Trump's current term at the White House

Asian allies will be **increasingly [shaped]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} **US
[perceptions]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the role [allies]{.mark} play in
[helping]{.mark} or hindering **US objectives [towards]{.mark}
[China]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [ongoing
[dispute]{.mark}]{.underline} between the US and China
[[concerning]{.mark} the acquisition of [5G]{.mark} networks is the
**[first]{.mark} major [test]{.mark}** of this proposition]{.underline}.
[[America]{.mark} has openly [threatened to]{.mark} [curb]{.mark}
**[intel]{.mark}ligence sharing** [with]{.mark}]{.underline} its closest
[[allies]{.mark} [if]{.mark} they choose to [entrust]{.mark}
[China's]{.mark} Huawei [Tech]{.mark}nologies Company]{.underline} [with
setting up their 5G networks]{.underline}.15 It remains to be seen what
practical conclusions the US will actually draw if major allies such as
France, Germany, Italy or the UK decide to 'go Chinese'. If no key
European ally chooses Huawei, following in Japan's and Australia's
footsteps, that outcome will be due at least in part to the strength of
America's campaign calling attention to the security and strategic
implications of their 5G decisions. [Given the **commercial
[advantage]{.mark}** enjoyed [by **Huawei**]{.mark}]{.underline} as a
result of the infrastructure it built up as part of 3G and 4G networks
and what is apparently massive state aid[, it could normally
[expect]{.mark} [to be]{.mark} [selected]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a
[5G]{.mark} prime [contractor]{.mark} in many markets in the absence of
**broader security** and **strategic considerations**]{.underline}.16
[As China's rise **consolidates** and]{.underline} as its
[**assertiveness** increases over time]{.underline}, [[NATO]{.mark} will
be]{.underline} systematically [[**forced** to choose]{.mark}
[between]{.mark} [working]{.mark} **[with]{.mark}** the
[US]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**without** the US [or]{.mark}
**[against]{.mark}** the [US]{.mark} [when it comes to]{.mark}
**relations** with [China]{.mark}]{.underline}. China itself well
understands this. It is handling the precedent-setting 5G confrontation
as a first-order political issue. Threats from Chinese ambassadors in
Europe and others arose from November 2019 onwards, while the general
tone of Chinese diplomacy in Europe and Canada deteriorated, with
punishments imposed on a broad range of issues.17 [Against this
backdrop]{.underline}, [the [relationship]{.mark} between the US and its
NATO allies will be increasingly [prone to]{.mark} **misunderstanding**
and **uncontrolled [disagreements]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is in the
North American and European interest to work together to avoid the
former and reduce the latter to manageable proportions. [Because
[European]{.mark} [and Canadian]{.mark} [interests]{.mark} may
**[align]{.mark} more [closely]{.mark}** [with China]{.mark}'s policies
than with America's on a number of key issues]{.underline} -- such as
the global financial order, the extraterritorial reach of American law
and climate change -- [[any US]{.mark}--[Europe]{.mark}
[mechanism]{.mark} for coping with differences would need [to]{.mark}
have a **[heavily transactional cast]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with or

[As Russia continues its **military buildup**]{.underline} along
Ukraine's borders, [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and the EU are [[trying
to]{.mark} [project]{.mark} a strong]{.underline}, [[united
front]{.underline}]{.mark} on these extraordinary and dangerous
developments. [But [Germany]{.mark} is **[undermining]{.mark}** that
[unity]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[leaving]{.mark} the **[West
weaker]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **more [divided]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Below, Strategic Europe editor-in-chief Judy Dempsey digs into what's
driving Germany's actions on this latest crisis. WHY IS GERMANY
RELUCTANT TO FOLLOW NATO ALLIES ON UKRAINE? Publicly, [[Berlin]{.mark}
**[toes]{.mark} the NATO [line]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} sending
[troops]{.mark} [and equipment]{.mark}]{.underline} to the Baltic states
and Romania in order to boost the alliance's eastern flank. In practice,
[it does not want to send any **defensive weapons**]{.underline} to
Ukraine. It blocked Estonia from sending such equipment, which had been
made in Germany, and a UK aircraft carrying military equipment to
Ukraine detoured around German airspace. The [German political
establishment [believes]{.mark} such [moves will **destabilize
Europe**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [make it]{.mark} more [difficult
to]{.mark} [have]{.mark} a **[dialogue]{.mark}** with
Russia]{.underline}. BUT [ISN'T RUSSIA TRYING TO DESTABILIZE
UKRAINE?]{.underline} [**[Germany]{.mark}** **doesn't see it that
way**]{.underline}. There is a part of the [German
establishment]{.underline} that [**[sees Ukraine]{.mark}**
[through]{.mark} the **[prism]{.mark}** [of
**Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For historical reasons, [this group
views Ukraine]{.underline}, [Belarus]{.underline}, [and Georgia as a
**cordon sanitaire** between Europe and Russia]{.underline}. There's a
legacy of both centuries-old rivalry and cooperation between Russia and
Germany. And there's the immense historical guilt of Germany's role in
World War II. Ukraine and Belarus suffered horribly under Adolf Hitler's
occupation, but somehow, these facts don't enter into the public
discourse. The historical guilt is centered on Russia, and German
politicians often refer to this legacy. DON'T BELARUS, GEORGIA, AND
UKRAINE ONE DAY WANT TO JOIN BOTH NATO AND THE EU? Yes. Joining the EU
is a long way off, but that is their goal. That is what drives the
reformers when it comes to strengthening democracy, the rule of law, and
an independent judiciary. That's what scares Russia: truly independent,
democratic countries on its border. And NATO is its red line. Putin does
not want any Eastern European countries joining this Western security
alliance. If they did, the United States would, from the security and
military points of view, dominate not only Western Europe but also
Eastern Europe. Russia would lose any leverage to influence events among
its immediate western neighbors. NATO would defend these countries if
they were threatened or attacked. That is why Putin is threatening
Ukraine and demanding a water-tight commitment from NATO that Ukraine
will not join. He does not want Ukraine integrated into the
Euro-Atlantic structures of NATO or the EU, nor does he want a secure
and democratic Ukraine on his doorstep. The fear of contagion would be
too big. HOW ARE NATO ALLIES REACTING TO GERMANY'S RELUCTANCE? With
anger. The Baltic states and Central European countries believe Germany
doesn't understand their security concerns or Russia's intentions. They
believe the [[German]{.mark} **political** and **business
[establishments]{.mark}** are **[so close]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
**[Russia]{.mark}** that [they]{.mark} [don't]{.mark} [want to
upset]{.mark} those **decades-long [ties]{.mark}**]{.underline}. DOES
GERMANY'S STANCE HAVE ANY SUPPORT? Yes, from France, but for different
reasons. President Emmanuel Macron wants a European, not a U.S-led,
response to this crisis. He wants Europe to have its own security and
defense policy that would create a kind of "strategic autonomy." In
Macron's view, the global geostrategic context has changed so much that
Europe has to develop its own instruments to defend itself and shape
policy. But [Germany has **no strategic compass**]{.underline}. Because
of World War II, it is locked into a pacifist way of thinking. This
explains why it is uncomfortable with Macron's idea, as are the Baltic
states, Poland, and other Central European countries. WHY IS THAT? The
Ukraine crisis has made Central Europe even more pro-NATO and
pro-American because of Germany's closeness to Russia and Macron's
ambitions to have a militarily and strategically capable Europe. These
countries will likely put a brake on any future EU integration,
especially when it comes to security, defense, and foreign policy, where
consensus would give way to simple majority voting under proposed
reforms. They don't trust France's intentions, which they see as
weakening Europe's relationship with NATO. They don't trust Berlin
because it is seen as too pro-Russia. This is bad news for the EU. HOW
THEN ARE EU AND NATO MEMBERS SEEKING A WAY OUT OF THIS CRISIS? With the
threat of more sanctions and with an increased NATO and U.S. military
presence in the Baltic states, Poland, and other Central European
countries. The United States is also stepping up its diplomatic efforts
with Moscow to deescalate the crisis. As yet, there's no consensus among
members of either the EU or NATO on the scope of the sanctions. HOW DOES
ENERGY FACTOR INTO GERMANY'S RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA? Currently,
[**natural [gas]{.mark}** [from Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}---which
[[accounts for]{.mark} [**more than half** of]{.mark} [Germany's]{.mark}
gas [imports]{.mark}]{.underline} and an average of 40 percent of the
rest of Europe's imports---must transit through Poland or Ukraine. But
[the [planned]{.mark} Nord Stream 2 [gas pipeline]{.mark} will [allow
Russia]{.mark} [to directly send]{.mark} more gas [to
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline} under the Baltic Sea. Some [European
countries **want** Germany to **stop** the
[pipeline]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which will]{.underline} [likely
[make]{.mark}]{.underline} Germany become more dependent on Russian gas.
And because Poland and Ukraine won't be needed to send Russian gas to
Europe (one of Moscow's goals in building Nord Stream 2),
[[Ukraine]{.mark} will be even [more **vulnerable**]{.mark} to
**pressure** [from Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly when it
comes to gas deliveries. Nord Stream 2 weakens Ukraine's leverage as an
access point for Russia to the European energy market. [[Yet]{.mark} for
all that]{.underline}, [[Germany **refuses**]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
**[stop]{.mark}** **the [pipeline]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Testimony of Edison Electric Institute official Scott Aaronson under

encapsulates some of the issues. Video of the exchange is available on
the web \[29\]. The Edison Electric Institute (EEI) is the trade
association that represents all US investor-owned electric companies.

Johnson: Mr. Aaronson, I just have to ask you -- the protocol of warning
15--30 min -- who is going to make that call? I mean, who is going to
make that for a massive geomagnetic disturbance, that nobody knows how
many of these transformers are going to be affected. Who is going to
make that call to shut them off line -- to take them off line -- so
those effects do not go through those wires and destroy those large
transformers that cannot be replaced?

Aaronson: [So]{.underline}, the [grid operators]{.underline} [are
**tightly aligned**]{.underline}. We talked about the fact that [there
are **1900 entities**]{.underline} [that make up]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} **[b]{.underline}**ulk **[e]{.underline}**lectric
**[s]{.underline}**ystem. [There are]{.underline} **[transmission
operators]{.underline}** and so on...

Johnson (interrupting): Who makes the call? Who makes the call -- we are
going to shut them all down in 30 min, in 15 min?

Aaronson: [It's **not as simple** as]{.underline} [cutting]{.underline}
the [power]{.underline}. [That's **not how** this is **going to
work**]{.underline} but there is again, there is this shared
responsibility among the sector.

## Case Turns

### 1NC\-\--CT\-\--Mega Constellations Bad

#### Satellite deployment makes [undersea cables]{.underline} obsolete.

In a world where our doorbells, headphones and printers are wireless, it
may surprise readers to read that [[over
**97%**](https://policyexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Undersea-Cables.pdf)
of **internet traffic** is transmitted through physical fibre-optic
**cables**]{.underline}, [laid on the **sea bed**]{.underline}.

[Each undersea cable]{.underline} consists of between [4 and 200 optical
fibres](https://policyexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Undersea-Cables.pdf),
each of which can [transmit about **400GB** **per second**]{.underline}.
There are [approximately [1.2 million
km](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/03/10/technology/internet-cables-oceans.html)
worth of undersea cables currently in operation]{.underline}, a spider's
web of 0s and 1s crisscrossing the Earth [carrying an estimated [**\$10
trillion** of financial
transfers](https://policyexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Undersea-Cables.pdf)]{.underline},
and over [1 sextillion
bytes](https://au.pcmag.com/features/57830/why-satellite-internet-is-the-new-space-race)
of data every day. [Most cables are **no thicker** than a **garden
hose**]{.underline}, an astonishing fact given they transmit data at the
rate of [terabytes per
second](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/25/asia/internet-undersea-cables-intl-hnk/index.html).

Worryingly, these [cables are largely protected **only** by the **sheer
vastness** of the ocean]{.underline} (a topic we've [explored
previously](https://www.ourfewcents.com/post/twenty-thousand-leagues-under-the-sea)).
Given how tenuous this safeguarding is, it is unsurprising that there
are over 200 cable failures every year. Most [people are oblivious to
cable damage incidents]{.underline} because
[providers](https://internethealthreport.org/2019/the-new-investors-in-underwater-sea-cables/),
mostly Internet giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, have
deliberately built redundancy into their systems, meaning that most
countries are serviced by multiple cables. In the event that one cable
suffers a failure, internet traffic is seamlessly re-routed to the
existing intact cables, if there are any. However, [a total of [19
countries](https://www.techradar.com/au/news/internet-access-hangs-by-a-thread-for-hundreds-of-millions)
rely on a **single cable** to provide them internet]{.underline},
including Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Togo and Sierra Leone. While countries
like the US, UK and Japan are supported by 91, 54 and 26 cables
respectively, over 5% of the world's population live in countries
supported by only two cables. As island nations, Australia and New
Zealand are particularly vulnerable in this respect, the latter being
supported by just three cables.

The majority of cable failures each year are inadvertently [caused by
humans](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/25/asia/internet-undersea-cables-intl-hnk/index.html),
rather than natural causes. The aforementioned blackout in Tonga was
apparently caused by a ships'
[anchor](https://www.abc.net.au/radio-australia/programs/pacificbeat/tonga-cable-outage/10765642)
damaging an undersea cable. Eight cables were damaged during an
earthquake in 2006, causing [internet
outages](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/25/asia/internet-undersea-cables-intl-hnk/index.html)
in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Japan, Korea and the Philippines. When
ships accidentally severed cables in the Mediterranean in 2008, [80% of
the
connectivity](https://policyexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Undersea-Cables.pdf)
between Europe and the Middle East was knocked out in a matter of hours.
In 2017, Australians were warned about [slow internet
speeds](https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/aussie-web-users-warned-to-expect-slow-speeds-for-at-least-six-weeks-after-undersea-cables-damaged/news-story/5ca81511fe7c51f8ee1cb5cfbac85e51)
due to cable damage caused by typhoons. In 2018, the entire country of
Mauritania was forced offline when a fishing trawler
[damaged](https://www.techradar.com/au/news/internet-access-hangs-by-a-thread-for-hundreds-of-millions)
an important cable link to Europe. 28 million Yemenis suffered a similar
fate in January 2020, when a single cable was severed.

That's just accidental breakages. There [remains]{.underline} the
[terrifying possibility of **deliberate attacks** by unfriendly
agents]{.underline}. We've previously expounded on the dangers of
[confidential messages being
decrypted](https://www.ourfewcents.com/post/encryption-a-primal-need) by
hostile actors. [What **better avenue** for this]{.underline} [[manner
of
**espionage**]{.underline}](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/07/the-creepy-long-standing-practice-of-undersea-cable-tapping/277855/)
[than **poorly guarded** optic fibres strung out in the vastness of the
ocean]{.underline}, [far from **prying eyes**]{.underline}? Far [more
terrifying is the prospect of a complete loss of internet
connectivity]{.underline} for entire countries, [crippling
economies](https://policyexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Undersea-Cables.pdf)
and [causing **massive social unrest**]{.underline}.

The cables are also vulnerable to attack, bizarrely enough, from
[sharks](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/this-map-shows-how-undersea-cables-move-internet-traffic-around-the-world/).
Given that sharks are so ancient they reportedly [predate
trees](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/respect-sharks-are-older-than-trees-3818/),
it is ironic that one of the newest inventions on Earth, the internet,
is vulnerable to one of the oldest. It appears that the truth is once
again stranger than, or at least as strange as, fiction - in the comedy
The IT Crowd, technically incompetent IT Manager Jen Barber is convinced
the "Internet" in fact lives inside a small black box\*.

So why do we use physical undersea cables, with all the attendant risks,
when we could use satellite communications instead? Simply put, because
fibre-optic cables use light to transmit information, they are both
faster and cheaper to use for the mind boggling scale of internet
traffic. Rather surprisingly, given the discussion above, the standard
measure of cable downtime is measured in a mere [seconds per
year](http://www.ieee-rogucci.org/files/The%20ROGUCCI%20Report.pdf),
indicating their reliability in adverse conditions. And of course,
repairs are far easier to undertake on the seabed than in Earth orbit.

Is the future in the skies?

Although the first Space Race was aimed at setting foot on the Moon (a
swashbuckling story we've covered
[here](https://www.ourfewcents.com/post/the-space-race)), of late focus
has shifted to [launching satellites into Earth orbit]{.underline}. As a
result, there are [now over [**2600
satellites**](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/satellite-database#:~:text=In%2Ddepth%20details%20on%20the,purpose%2C%20and%20other%20operational%20details)
in orbit]{.underline}, with 180 belonging to SpaceX specifically to
provide [internet
services](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21043229/spacex-starlink-satellite-mega-constellation-concerns-astronomy-space-traffic).

Looking ahead, [satellite internet would]{.underline} offer the next
quantum leap in internet accessibility, while potentially
[sidestep]{.underline}ping some of the [**intractable issues** faced by
undersea cables]{.underline}. Remarkably, the development of
geostationary satellite communication was [heavily
influenced](http://lakdiva.org/clarke/1945ww/) by a 1945
[publication](http://lakdiva.org/clarke/1945ww/1945ww_oct_305-308.html)
by the prescient sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke, a full 20 years before
the first commercial example was launched.

No technology is as profoundly important to the global economy as the
[internet]{.underline}, which is [**dependent** on the security of a
**vast network**]{.underline} of some 750,000 miles [of **seabed
cables** that criss-cross the oceans' depths]{.underline}. The
[interdependence of]{.underline} global submarine [communication systems
means that a break in one cable can have **cascading effects** on
internet access to **distant states**]{.underline}. While the rules to
protect this critical infrastructure in peacetime should be refurbished,
the need to further develop the rules to secure this global
infrastructure during periods of armed conflict is perhaps even more
compelling. Although several peacetime treaties protect submarine cables
from disruption and criminal acts, albeit weakly, the rules that apply
during naval war are even more antiquated. Because the law of naval
warfare is principally based on custom and state practice rather than
treaties, there is considerable uncertainty over how submarine cables
would fare in conflict at sea.

Bryan **Clark 16**, Senior Fellow with the Center for Strategic and
Budgetary Assessments, "Undersea cables and the future of submarine
competition," *Bulletin of Atomic Scientists* 72(4)

Given the likely economic and military impacts of cable breaks, the
ability to threaten or protect submarine cables and their shore landings
will be increasingly important in future conflicts. In a crisis, an
aggressor could use multiple coordinated attacks on cables to compel an
opponent to back down or employ them as part of an opening offensive to
cut off the defender's military forces from national commanders,
intelligence data, and sensor information. [[**Cable attacks**
could]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be]{.mark} **highly
[destabilizing]{.mark}**]{.underline}, since [[they]{.mark} could

Many [**great [civilisations]{.mark}** have
**[fall]{.mark}**en]{.underline}, leaving nothing but cracked ruins and
scattered genetics. Usually this results [[from:]{.mark} **natural
[disasters]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} **resource [depletion]{.mark}**[,
**econ**]{.mark}**omic [meltdown]{.mark}**[, **disease**, **poor
info**]{.mark}**rmation** flow and corruption]{.underline}. But we're
luckier than our predecessors because [we command a technology that no
one else possessed: a rapid communication network that finds its highest
expression in the internet]{.underline}. I propose that there are six
ways in which [the **[net]{.mark}** has **vastly [reduced]{.mark}** the
[threat of]{.mark} **societal [collapse]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[**[Epidemics]{.mark}** can be **[deflected]{.mark}** by
telepresence]{.underline}

One of our more dire prospects for collapse is an infectious-disease
epidemic[. Viral and bacterial epidemics precipitated the fall of **the
Golden Age of Athens**,]{.underline} the Roman Empire and most of the
empires of the Native Americans. [The internet can be our key to
survival because the ability to [work telepresently]{.mark} can
**[inhibit]{.mark} microbial [transmission]{.mark}** by reducing
human-to-human contact]{.underline}. In the face of an otherwise
devastating epidemic, businesses can keep supply chains running with the
maximum number of employees working from home. This can reduce host
density below the tipping point required for an epidemic. [If we are
well prepared when an epidemic arrives, [we can **fluidly**]{.mark}
shift into a **[self-quarantine]{.mark}d** society]{.underline} in which
microbes fail due to host scarcity. Whatever the social ills of
isolation, they are worse for the microbes than for us.

[The internet will **[predict]{.mark} natural
[disasters]{.mark}**]{.underline}

We are witnessing the downfall of slow central control in the media:
news stories are increasingly becoming user-generated nets of
up-to-the-minute information. During the recent California wildfires,
locals went to the TV stations to learn whether their neighbourhoods
were in danger. But the news stations appeared most concerned with the
fate of celebrity mansions, so Californians changed their tack: they
uploaded geotagged mobile-phone pictures, updated Facebook statuses and
tweeted. The balance tipped: the internet carried news about the fire
more quickly and accurately than any news station could. In this
grass-roots, decentralised scheme, there were embedded reporters on
every block, and the news shockwave kept ahead of the fire. This head
start could provide the extra hours that save us. If the Pompeiians had
had the internet in 79AD, they could have easily marched 10km to safety,
well ahead of the pyroclastic flow from Mount Vesuvius. If the Indian
Ocean had the Pacific's networked tsunami-warning system, South-East
Asia would look quite different today.

Discoveries are retained and shared

Historically, critical information has required constant rediscovery.
Collections of learning \-- from the library at Alexandria to the entire
Minoan civilisation \-- have fallen to the bonfires of invaders or the
wrecking ball of natural disaster. Knowledge is hard won but easily
lost. And information that survives often does not spread. Consider
smallpox inoculation: this was under way in India, China and Africa
centuries before it made its way to Europe. By the time the idea reached
North America, native civilisations who needed it had already collapsed.
The net solved the problem. New discoveries catch on immediately;
information spreads widely. In this way, societies can optimally ratchet
up, using the latest bricks of knowledge in their fortification against
risk.

Tyranny is mitigated

Censorship of ideas was a familiar spectre in the last century, with
state-approved news outlets ruling the press, airwaves and copying
machines in the USSR, Romania, Cuba, China, Iraq and elsewhere. In many
cases, such as Lysenko's agricultural despotism in the USSR, it directly
contributed to the collapse of the nation. Historically, a more
successful strategy has been to confront free speech with free speech
\-- and the internet allows this in a natural way. It democratises the
flow of information by offering access to the newspapers of the world,
the photographers of every nation, the bloggers of every political
stripe. Some posts are full of doctoring and dishonesty whereas others
strive for independence and impartiality \-- but all are available to us
to sift through. Given the attempts by some governments to build
firewalls, it's clear that this benefit of the net requires constant
vigilance.

[**Human [capital]{.mark}** is **vastly
[increased]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Crowdsourcing brings people together to solve problems.]{.underline}
Yet far fewer than one per cent of the world's population is involved.
We need expand human capital. Most of the world not have access to the
education afforded a small minority. For every Albert Einstein, Yo-Yo Ma
or Barack Obama who has educational opportunities, uncountable others do
not. This squandering of talent translates into reduced economic output
and a smaller pool of problem solvers. [**The [net]{.mark}**
[opens]{.mark} the gates **[ed]{.mark}ucation** [to **anyone**]{.mark}
with a computer]{.underline}. A motivated teen anywhere on the planet
can walk through the world's knowledge \-- from the webs of Wikipedia to
the curriculum of MIT's OpenCourseWare[. The new [**human capital** will
serve us]{.mark} well [when we confront **existential threats** we've
**never imagined**]{.mark} before.]{.underline}

[Energy expenditure is reduced]{.underline}

Societal collapse can often be understood in terms of an energy budget:
[when energy spend outweighs energy return, collapse
ensues]{.underline}. This has taken the form of deforestation or soil
erosion; [currently, the worry involves fossil-fuel depletion. The
internet addresses the energy problem with a natural ease]{.underline}.
Consider the massive energy savings inherent in the shift from paper to
electrons \-- as seen in the transition from the post to email.
[Ecommerce reduces the need to drive long distances to purchase
products]{.underline}. [Delivery trucks are more
eco-friendly]{.underline} than individuals driving around, not least
because of tight packaging and optimisation algorithms for driving
routes. Of course, there are energy costs to the banks of computers that
underpin the internet \-- but these costs are less than the wood, coal
and oil that would be expended for the same quantity of information
flow.

[The tangle of [events that trigger]{.mark}s **societal
[collapse]{.mark}** [can be **complex**]{.mark},]{.underline} and there
are several threats the net does not address. [But **vast, networked
[communication]{.mark}** [can be an **antidote** to]{.mark} several of
the most deadly diseases **threatening
[civilization]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The next time your coworker
laments internet addiction, the banality of tweeting or the decline of
face-to-face conversation, you may want to suggest that the net may just
be the technology that saves us.

The danger of kinetic strikes increasing orbital debris is a common
theme in the literature, but [the **[positive deterrent]{.mark}**
**effects** [of]{.mark}]{.underline} some [[debris]{.mark} are often
**[overlooked]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [[debris]{.mark} resulting
from destroyed satellites]{.underline}, [or other space
objects]{.underline}, [[creates]{.mark} a **[deterrent]{.mark}
[effect]{.mark}** [on actors]{.mark} [who]{.mark} might otherwise
**[violate]{.mark}** international [norms]{.mark} [and
**strike**]{.mark} at **objects [in space]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[either to test their capabilities or as an act of
hostilities]{.underline}. This is not deterrence in the traditional
sense, of one actor publicly threatening punishment in response to
another actor's unwanted actions. It is not deterrence by denial since
the attacker is not damaged and may even achieve its objective. Nor is
it deterrence by punishment because the debris itself does not threaten
to punish the attacker's country. But [debris can **[increase]{.mark}**
the **future [costs]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the aggressor]{.underline},
[even if their initial [attack]{.mark} **succeeds**]{.underline}, and
thus it [[has]{.mark} a similar **[restraining effect]{.mark}** on
certain behavior]{.underline}. Like the automated response of the U.S.
tripwire in West Germany, [the [threat]{.mark} that [debris]{.mark} can
[pose]{.mark} to state interests [acts as]{.mark}]{.underline} a form of
[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least [to prevent]{.underline}
some [actors from taking certain types of actions]{.underline}.
[[Removing]{.mark} the danger of [debris]{.mark} will
**[weaken]{.mark}** that [restraint]{.mark} [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
thus **[[weaken deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[making]{.mark}
**[ASAT]{.mark}** **test[s]{.mark}** [and **hostile actions**]{.mark} in
space **[more likely]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Several factors may deter a
state from launching kinetic tests or striking against an adversary's
interests in space. For one thing, if a state's adversary has similar
capabilities to destroy objects in space, deterrence would be a function
of not wanting to escalate tensions. Although international law only
explicitly prohibits states from placing weapons of mass destruction in
orbit, international space law, like the Outer Space Treaty \[30\], does
provide a framework for addressing the activities of one state that lead
to the damage of another state's property. Likewise, there are
international norms (informal but expected rules of behavior) against
the weaponization of space. But these norms seem to be in decline
\[31\], and such norms only deter a state from engaging in certain types
of behavior if the state cares about following norms, if it cares about
how states perceive its behavior, or if it believes other states are
willing to enforce the norms. [The **beauty** of [debris as]{.mark} a
[deterrent]{.mark} is that it **does [not rely]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the
**[enforcement]{.mark}** of norms or the credibility of states [to
succeed]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Some potential solutions to the debris problem will be faster and more
effective than others. The [**irony** is that more efficient solutions
to the debris problem will more **heavily weaken** the effect that
debris has to **deter tests** and attacks on space assets]{.underline}.
[If someone develops the ability to quickly and efficiently remove
debris]{.underline} once it is created, then [states will have **fewer
disincentives** against using **kinetic weapons** in space]{.underline},
such as antisatellite ballistic missiles, [or to
**activate**]{.underline} some of the alleged [**hunter-killer**
**satellites**]{.underline} already [in space]{.underline} \[41,42\]. In
effect, [the current difficulty cleaning up space]{.underline} is a
factor that [**strengthens deterrence** because it **constrains**
certain states from engaging in **hostile activities**]{.underline},
[who otherwise might do so **absent** the **threat** to their **own

poses **enough of a threat** that it continues to deter]{.underline}
kinetic [hostilities while posing a **small enough threat** to
**existing orbital objects** that it does not **dramatically hinder**

optimal amount, which will be different for each orbit and the actor

Under this definition, "security sector assistance" includes the

Complicating matters, though, Congress has considered a proposed
definition for "security sector assistance" that, in contrast to the
presidential policy definition,130 encompasses DoS programs, but not DoD
or other executive agency programs.131 In addition,
[[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[**defined** "security

which the DoD defines as a subset of security cooperation that is funded

Colorado Boulder, "Solving the space junk problem",

HBisevac)

Space is getting crowded. Aging satellites and space debris crowd
low-Earth orbit, and [launching new satellites **adds** to the
**collision risk**]{.underline}. The [most **effective way** to solve
the space junk problem]{.underline}, according to a new study,
[is]{.underline} not to capture debris or deorbit old satellites: it's
[an international agreement to charge operators]{.underline}
"**[orbital]{.underline}**-**[use fees]{.underline}**" [for **every
satellite** put into orbit]{.underline}.

[Orbital use fees would]{.underline} also [increase the
**long**]{.underline}-[**run value** of the space industry]{.underline},
said economist Matthew Burgess, a CIRES Fellow and co-author of the new
paper. [By reducing future **satellite** and **debris collision**
risk]{.underline}, an annual fee rising to about \$235,000 per satellite
would quadruple the value of the satellite industry by 2040, he and his
colleagues concluded in a paper published today in the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences.

"Space is a common resource, but companies aren't accounting for the
cost their satellites impose on other operators when they decide whether
or not to launch," said Burgess, who is also an assistant professor in
environmental studies and an affiliated faculty member in economics at
CU Boulder. "We need a policy that lets satellite operators directly
factor in the costs their launches impose on other operators."

Currently, an estimated 20,000 objects---including satellites and space
debris---are crowding low-Earth orbit. It's the latest tragedy of the
commons, the researchers said: Each operator launches more and more
satellites until their private collision risk equals the value of the
orbiting satellite.

So far, proposed solutions have been primarily technological or
managerial, said Akhil Rao, assistant professor of economics at
Middlebury College and the paper's lead author. Technological fixes
include removing space debris from orbit with nets, harpoons, or lasers.
Deorbiting a satellite at the end of its life is a managerial fix.

Ultimately, [engineering or **managerial solutions**]{.underline} like
these [**won't solve** the debris problem because they **don't change**
the **incentives** for operators]{.underline}. For example, [removing
space debris might motivate operators to **launch** **more**
satellites]{.underline}---[further crowding]{.underline}
**[l]{.underline}**ow-**[E]{.underline}**arth **[o]{.underline}**rbit,
**[increasing collision risk]{.underline}**, and raising costs.

"[This is an **incentive problem** more than an **engineering
problem**]{.underline}. [What's key is getting the **incentives
right**]{.underline}," Rao said.

A [better approach to the space debris problem]{.underline}, Rao and his
colleagues found, [is to implement an orbital-use fee]{.underline}---[a
**tax** on **orbiting satellites**]{.underline}.

"That's not the same as a launch fee," Rao said, "Launch fees by
themselves can't induce operators to deorbit their satellites when
necessary, and it\'s not the launch but the orbiting satellite that
causes the damage."

Orbital-use fees could be straight-up fees or tradeable permits, and
they could also be orbit-specific, since satellites in different orbits
produce varying collision risks. Most important, [the fee for each
satellite would be **calculated** to **reflect** the **cost** to the
industry of putting another satellite into orbit]{.underline},
[including **projected current** and **future costs** of **additional
collision risk** and **space debris production**]{.underline}---costs
operators don't currently factor into their launches.

"[In our model]{.underline}, what matters is that [satellite operators
are **paying the cost** of the **collision risk** imposed on **other
operators**]{.underline}," said Daniel Kaffine, professor of economics
and RASEI Fellow at CU Boulder and co-author on the paper.

And those fees would increase over time, to account for the rising value
of cleaner orbits. In the researchers' model, the optimal fee would rise
at a rate of 14 percent per year, reaching roughly \$235,000 per
satellite-year by 2040.

For an orbital-use fee approach to work, the researchers found, all
countries launching satellites would need to participate---that\'s about
a dozen that launch satellites on their own launch vehicles and more
than 30 that own satellites. In addition, each country would need to
charge the same fee per unit of collision risk for each satellite that
goes into orbit, although each country could collect revenue separately.
Countries use similar approaches already in carbon taxes and fisheries
management.

In this study, Rao and his colleagues [compared orbital-use fees to
**business as usual**]{.underline} (that is, open access to space) [and
to technological fixes such as removing space debris]{.underline}. They
[found that orbital use fees **forced operators** to directly **weigh**
the **expected lifetime value** of their satellites against the **cost**
to industry of **putting another satellite** into **orbit** and creating
**additional risk**]{.underline}. In other scenarios, operators still
had incentive to race into space, hoping to extract some value before it
got too crowded.

With orbital-use fees, the long-run value of the satellite industry
would increase from around \$600 billion under the business-as-usual
scenario to around \$3 trillion, researchers found. The increase in
value comes from reducing collisions and collision-related costs, such
as launching replacement satellites.

[Orbital-use fees could]{.underline} also [help satellite operators get
**ahead** of the **space junk problem**]{.underline}. "In other sectors,
addressing the tragedy of the commons has often been a game of catch-up
with substantial social costs. But the relatively [young space industry

As two experts who have witnessed the cascading impacts of crises from
the front lines of industry and government, we know the importance of
cyber defense and the impact that a major event could have on our
country. That's why we\'re calling on [President
Biden](https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden) to mitigate the looming
cyber threat in the first 100 days of his administration. Here's how:
First, [[the]{.mark} [president]{.mark} [should]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[nominate]{.underline}]{.mark} [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} National
[[Cyber]{.mark} [Director]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} begin
staffing the office]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
[[bring]{.underline}]{.mark} [together the full
[resources]{.mark}]{.underline} [of the]{.underline} [federal
government]{.underline} [[and the private sector]{.underline}]{.mark}
around a united cybersecurity strategy. A whole-of-nation approach to
cybersecurity is required [to deter our adversaries]{.underline} [and
strengthen our homeland]{.underline} --- and [American
[businesses]{.mark}]{.underline} [must be a key partner]{.underline} in
this fight. [The]{.underline} [private sector [has]{.mark}
a]{.underline} [[tremendous]{.underline}]{.mark} [amount of
[knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline} [and capabilities]{.underline} to bring
to the table, which is why the National Cyber Director must engage
deeply with the business community on how to protect American companies,
accelerate intelligence sharing, and leverage new technologies to
strengthen our cybersecurity posture. [Bolstering direct
collaboration]{.underline} between the White House and business leaders
on cyber matters [is how we build better resiliency]{.underline} and
defend against our adversaries with greater speed and agility. Second[,
the new administration]{.underline} [must make it a priority
to]{.underline} [lead the way]{.underline} [in setting new
[international]{.mark} information]{.underline} [and
communications]{.underline} [technology standards]{.underline}. Much of
[today's [fragmented standards]{.mark}]{.underline} [[place
a]{.mark}n]{.underline} unnecessary [[burden]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} American [[businesses]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
[[stifling]{.mark} [issue]{.mark} [response]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
reducing real [transparency]{.mark} for consumers]{.underline}. Compared
to other countries, the United States is not participating as much or as
effectively in global forums where these types of international
standards are set. As Sen. [Mark
Warner](https://thehill.com/people/mark-warner) (D-Va.) recently said,
"We used to [flood the
zone](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-urge-next-administration-to-focus-on-cybersecurity-11603877402)
at all these technical conferences. We are not doing that anymore." But
other countries like [Russia and
China](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/09/16/russia-and-china-are-trying-to-set-the-u-n-s-rules-on-cybercrime/)
are. American interests and security are strengthened when international
standards are developed and set with active U.S. participation. Third,
the new administration should work quickly with Congress to establish a
Joint Collaborative Environment, a mechanism by which the federal
government can share with the private sector classified and unclassified
cyber threat information, insights, and other relevant data --- to the
greatest extent possible. Today's aged and fragmented approach to
intelligence sharing must change. When it comes to winning in
cyberspace, speed matters, collaboration matters, and communication
matters. [The private sector needs faster access to intel to preempt
cyber threats, fast-twitch engagement to mitigate attacks in the heat of
the battle, and stronger, ongoing communication with partners from
government to collectively elevate our defenses]{.underline}. Through
this common environment, we can build a coordinated public-private
approach to cybersecurity. Fourth, [the president must]{.underline}
[address]{.underline} [the security of our technology]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [communications]{.underline} [supply
chain]{.underline} as a result of SolarWinds breach. As Sen. [Ben
Sasse](https://thehill.com/people/benjamin-ben-sasse) (R-Neb.) [recently
said](https://omaha.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/russian-hack-puts-a-spotlight-on-sasses-cyber-warfare-planning-push/article_21985a58-4156-11eb-a4e2-e344cc20852d.html),
"There's just a hard truth that we're decades behind where we need to be
for cyber." The grim reality is that there are a countless number of
third-party vendors just like SolarWinds who have the data, access, and
trust of American businesses and countless government institutions.
That's exactly why [[the U.S. government]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[needs]{.mark} [to take immediate]{.mark}]{.underline} [[steps]{.mark}
[to build a [trusted supply
chain](https://www.solarium.gov/public-communications/supply-chain-white-paper)]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[which]{.mark} [include]{.mark}]{.underline} [activating a lead
agency]{.underline} [to support supply chain risk efforts]{.underline};
[[mapping]{.mark} how and where [key]{.mark} [vendors]{.mark} are used
in our digital infrastructure; and accelerating better intelligence
sharing, risk assessments, [and product testing]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
we've seen, the consequences of failing to protect our technology and
communications supply chain has far reaching implications.

**Blair, 18** (Bruce Blair, nuclear security expert and a research
scholar at the Program on Science and Global Security at Princeton and
the co-founder of Global Zero, Strengthening Checks on Presidential
Nuclear Launch Authority, January/February 2018, Arms Control Today,
<https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-01/features/strengthening-checks-presidential-nuclear-launch-authority>)

[U.S. nuclear launch protocol has important virtues and serious
liabilities]{.underline}. [Major changes are needed to constrain a
president who would seek to initiate the first use of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} without apparent cause [and]{.underline} to
[prevent him or her from being pushed into making nuclear retaliatory
decisions in haste.]{.underline}

The virtues of the protocol---the procedures and timelines for ordering
the use of nuclear weapons and for carrying out such an order---are
twofold. First, it concentrates launch authority at the highest level of
the executive branch, the presidency, taking it out of the hands of the
military and others. This is a function of paramount importance. The
principle of civilian control over weapons of mass destruction must
never be compromised. Together with the imposition of organizational and
technical safeguards on the weapons and their handlers, the protocol
elevates the locus of launch capability, as well as of launch authority,
to the highest practical level.1

Second, it is designed to allow the president and the nuclear forces
under his command to respond rapidly and decisively in the face of an
enemy attack by nuclear-armed missiles that can fly from the opposite
side of the planet to U.S. territory in 30 minutes or from
forward-deployed submarines in 15 minutes.2 This is of critical
importance in view of the acute vulnerability of U.S. nuclear command,
control, and communications, as well as of a large portion of the U.S.
strategic nuclear arsenal, particularly the silo-based missile force and
the bomber fleet in its normal peacetime posture.3

Despite fast-flying inbound warheads, the protocol on paper provides
enough time for detecting and assessing an attack, convening an
emergency conference between the president and his top nuclear advisers,
briefing the president on his options and their consequences,
authenticating the president's decision, and formatting and transmitting
a launch order to the launch crews in time to ensure the survival and
execution of their forces.

**[The flip side of these virtues are serious
liabilities]{.underline}**. [The protocol concentrates
authority]{.underline} [and emphasizes speed to such a degree that it
may allow a president to railroad the nuclear commanders into initiating
a first strike without apparent cause and quickly executing an order
that may be horrifyingly misguided,]{.underline} [illegal, or both. A
demented commander-in-chief could start a nuclear
conflagration]{.underline} that [no one could forestall,]{.underline}
veto, or stop.

[Equally deleterious, a president can become hostage to the protocol
itself, like a conductor on a runaway train, if an enemy nuclear strike
appears underway]{.underline}. [He may be pushed into hastily ordering
"retaliation"]{.underline} in response [to a false alarm]{.underline}.
[Rationality would be lost in the fog of crisis]{.underline} under a
short deadline fraught with confusion and emotion.

[Protocol for Intentional First Use]{.underline}

[If the president wishes to order the first use of nuclear weapons, he
would be expected to do so in close consultation with his top national
security advisers]{.underline}, particularly the secretaries of defense
and state (statutory advisers on the National Security Council), the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the national security adviser,
and the senior generals who command the military forces. Depending on
the urgency of the situation, this could be a protracted process with
extensive planning, heightened force readiness, and regular briefings of
the president, or [it could be truncated]{.underline} to minutes [if an
imminent attack is perceived.]{.underline}

[When a decision is imminent, the process goes critical.]{.underline}
The commander-in-chief would be connected to his key advisers via a
secure communications network designed to support nuclear emergency
actions. The president could initiate this conference anytime, even
abruptly in the night, through his military aide who is always nearby
with the "football"---a satchel containing the nuclear war plans,
including a one-pager graphically depicting the major options at his
disposal.

The best location for conferencing would be the blast-resistant
emergency operations center under the East Wing of the White House.
Advisers could be assembled there, and others linked by secure phone.
Such a conference could be convened almost anywhere, from Mar-a-Lago or
other locations or aboard his ground-transport vehicles and dedicated
aircraft, including Air Force One and his "doomsday" plane.4 Secure
communications are far less reliable when the president is traveling or
in the process of being evacuated to a safe location. The advisers may
or may not join the conference in a timely way. If a brewing crisis
suddenly escalates and catches them off guard, key advisers may fail to
get on the call before a president decides the time to strike has
arrived. During nuclear release exercises and real-world incidents
involving North Korea and other nations over the past decade, missile
launch preparations or actual firings posing a potential threat
triggered emergency conferences, but notification often failed to reach
key advisers in time. Sometimes none of the advisers checked in, leaving
the president and the head of Strategic Command (StratCom), whose role
is to brief the president on nuclear options and their consequences,
alone in the hot seats.5 After this briefing, the president may seek
advice from any, all, or none of the advisers in the room or on the
telephone before rendering a decision, which likely but not necessarily
involves choosing a preprogrammed option.6 Formally, he does not need
any approval or consent, although StratCom or others on the call could
attempt to dissuade the president if his thinking or final decision veer
into the realm of the obviously misguided or illegal.7 Even the defense
secretary has no particular role other than offering advice if asked.
Contrary to widespread belief, he does not confirm the order or
otherwise bless it in any way. But this is their last chance to change
the president's mind before a formal launch order is prepared by the
Pentagon, disseminated, and inexorably implemented. Listening in on the
exchange is the Pentagon war room, a kind of boutique service dedicated
to executing the orders of the president and the defense secretary.8
Following the drift of the conversation, this entity would start
preparing a launch order. When the president finally declares his choice
of option, it would challenge the president to authenticate using a
special code known as the "biscuit," or Gold Code. This would take a few
seconds. If the codes match properly, it would quickly format and
transmit a launch order over multiple communications channels directly
to the submarine, bomber, and underground launch crews. This would take
a couple of minutes. Shorter than the length of a "tweet," the order
would specify the war plan, the time to begin the strike, an unlock code
needed by the firing crews to release their weapons, and a Sealed
Authentication Code that must match the codes in the firing crews' safe.
If the codes match, the crews assume the order originated with the
president, even though all the codes in the launch order are held
exclusively by the Pentagon war room and alternate command centers such
as StratCom itself. The underground Minuteman crews could complete their
launch checklist in a little more than a minute. Today, as many as 400
missiles could be launched from their underground silos in less than
five minutes after the president gave the order.9 Submarines and bombers
would be the primary attackers in a scenario involving North Korea. With
two boats typically on launch-ready patrol in the Pacific Ocean, the sub
force would be capable of quickly firing about 200 warheads roughly 15
minutes after the president gave the order.10 If the order came without
a prior raising of alert readiness, however, the boats would surface to
confirm its validity. Bombers on full alert with bombs and cruise
missiles loaded,11 as they would be in times of heightened tension,
would need eight hours or so to fly from their U.S. bases to near the
border of their target countries, where they would fire cruise missiles
at inland targets or proceed to fly into enemy airspace to drop gravity
bombs. They could deliver upward of 500 weapons. Protocol for
Second-Strike Scenarios A decision to strike back in retaliation
theoretically could be drawn out for days and weeks, but the protocol is
designed to yield one in minutes. The basic procedures are the same for
first and second use of nuclear weapons, but the timelines shrink in the
latter case. Reactions from the bottom to the top of the chain of
command to an apparent attack are driven by checklists and virtually
preordained. The action could be described as a rote enactment of a
prepared script with very high expectations in all quarters that a
nuclear response would be authorized immediately. Historically, the
notion of riding out an attack has been operationally anathema to the
military. As General Lee Butler, a former head of the strategic forces,
stated, "Our policy was premised on being able to accept the first wave
of attacks.... Yet at the operational level it was never accepted....
They built a construct that powerfully biased the president's decision
process toward launch before the arrival of the first enemy warhead...a
move in practice to a system structured to drive the president
invariably toward a decision to launch under attack."12 This is called
"jamming" the president, or pressuring him to quickly authorize
retaliation while under apparent or confirmed attack.13 Jamming is still
the norm in current nuclear operations. Although President Barack Obama
directed the Pentagon to reduce our reliance on launch on warning and
find ways to increase warning and decision time, nuclear exercises still
feature this high-pressure tactic. In some high-threat situations, the
StratCom commander's briefing of the president may be compressed to as
little as 30 seconds, and then the president may be pressed to
"deliberate and decide" in six minutes or less. The persistent
vulnerability of the nuclear command system and hundreds of U.S.
missiles requires extremely fast reaction at all levels. In truth,
everyone gets jammed. The risk of mistaken launch on false warning
remains significant even today, 25 years after the end of the Cold War.
It also creates pressure to pre-empt an imminent attack. To relieve the
jamming pressure today, the protocol must start earlier and under
conditions of greater uncertainty about the degree of threat posed by
missile launch preparations or actual firings. During the Cold War, even
the really close calls did not rise to the level of presidential
notification.14 Today, there are more missile launches than ever to
track, and assessing whether they pose a threat has become more
difficult.15 Ironically this surge, which has happened over the past
decade or so, has spawned great unpredictability, complicated
assessment, and led on multiple occasions to presidents being notified
of an ambiguous imminent threat in progress.16

Reforms: Toward a True Retaliatory Posture

[A six-minute deadline for deliberation and decision is ridiculous. The
president needs]{.underline} much [more]{.underline} warning and
decision time to rationally cope with indications of a nuclear attack on
the United States or its allies. [He must no longer be jammed to
authorize]{.underline} [what could be a civilization-ending
response]{.underline} to attack indications that may be false. **[The
risks of miscalculation and irrational decision-making leading to
incoherent operations and further escalation are unacceptably
high]{.underline}**.

This terrifying reality has been ignored for decades. Reform is long
overdue.

This means that the current prompt-launch posture must be drastically
altered. [Use-or-lose forces]{.underline} such as the silo-based missile
force [should be eliminated]{.underline}. Launch on warning should be
eliminated. Reducing the vulnerability of command, control, and
communications to kinetic attack and cyberattack should be the top
priority of the nuclear modernization plan, even if it means cutting
spending on replacement forces in the pipeline. The submarine force has
already become the premier leg of the strategic triad, the central
component of U.S. deterrence policy. This force can patiently wait for
months for direction from higher authority.

[Equally overdue is the adoption of a policy that eschews the first use
of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. **[A clear marker would be established
in limiting the president's leeway to initiate a first
strike]{.underline}**.17 If taken seriously, [the operational plans
would also be modified in ways that would hamstring any effort to order
the use of nuclear weapons without apparent cause]{.underline}.

**[Congress has considerable legal standing to pass legislation that
prohibits first use]{.underline}**. A recent bill introduced by
Representative Adam Smith (D-Wash.) is a step in this direction,18 but
**[a law would draw real redlines around the policy]{.underline}**.
**[Crossing them would make the president accountable and even
impeachable.]{.underline}**

The [Trump]{.underline} administration [appears to be heading in the
opposite direction]{.underline}. Its nuclear review in the works is
leaning toward the deployment of smaller-yield nuclear weapons (e.g., a
primary-only warhead on Trident missiles) that will make them more
usable in both first- and second-use scenarios. [It is]{.underline} also
[leaning toward widening the conditions under which nuclear weapons may
be used first]{.underline} in response to non-nuclear strategic
aggression and toward revoking Obama-era assurances given to non-nuclear
countries that the United States would never attack them with nuclear
weapons.

Our efforts here go beyond mere words -- they are backed by actions. As
I have discussed before, a key aspect of improving spaceflight safety,
and assuring we can monitor the space environment more closely, is our
space situational awareness ([SSA) capabilities]{.underline}. We have
been working on this for some time, and I am happy to report that we
have made some real progress over the last year. That [progress
comes]{.underline} [in two forms -- new sensors and
info]{.underline}rmation [sharing agreements]{.underline}.

On the sensor front, we have remained on a constant path for the last
several years to reposition sensors where they can do the most good and
to invest in new sensors where needed. Last year we reported that we had
entered into an agreement with Australia to relocate and repurpose a
launch tracking radar, the C-Band radar, from Antigua to western
Australia to aid in our ability to monitor activities at low altitude in
the southern hemisphere. That work is now underway. We complemented that
effort with a second agreement signed with Australia this past November
to relocate the DARPA-developed Space Surveillance Telescope to western
Australia to give us an unmatched ability to track deep space objects in
that critical region of the world. Additionally, after years of focused
effort, and a sequestration-imposed six-month delay, we will soon award
the contract for the first Space Fence site. The Space Fence will
provide an unprecedented ability to track an order-of-magnitude greater
number of objects in low earth orbit, supporting long-term spaceflight
safety.

[[The Department]{.mark} has]{.underline} also [[made great strides
in]{.mark} more transparently [sharing SSA]{.mark} information [with
other space operators]{.mark}.]{.underline} Over the past year, U.S.
Strategic Command ([USSTRATCOM]{.underline}) has [continued to pursue
SSA sharing agreements with commercial companies [and foreign
governments]{.mark}, consistent with existing legislative
authority]{.underline}. This year, USSTRATCOM signed five agreements
with other governments -- Australia, Japan, Italy, Canada, and France --
and increased to forty-one our agreements with commercial satellite
operators. Many more agreements are in varying stages of negotiation.
[We are committed to [providing]{.mark} SSA services to enhance
spaceflight safety for all]{.underline}.

While the purpose of [these agreements]{.underline} is to allow us to
share more advanced space flight safety products with other space-faring
nations, they really serve to [lay the groundwork for the next stage of
effort -- **[two-way data sharing]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The space
environment is too big and too complex for a single nation to bear the
entire cost of monitoring it. Cost-effective SSA requires cooperation
among space actors. The increasingly congested space environment means
that an unparalleled level of [[info]{.underline}]{.mark}rmation
[[sharing]{.mark}]{.underline} is needed to [**[promote]{.mark} safe and
[responsible op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}** in space [and]{.mark} to
**[reduce]{.mark} the [likelihood of]{.mark} mishaps,
[misperceptions]{.mark}, and mistrust**]{.underline}. [We
are]{.underline} currently [engaged in detailed technical discussions
with several nations that have space situational awareness capabilities
to explore opportunities for two-way info]{.underline}rmation [exchange.
This type of [sharing will **increase SSA**]{.mark}
**[info]{.mark}rmation [available]{.mark}** [to the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [while
limiting unnecessary duplication of SSA capabilities]{.underline}. In

Alliances: Forging the US--Pakistan Alliance",
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2347797019842430>, HBisevac)

The central argument of the article is that [[when]{.underline}]{.mark}
prospective [**[allies]{.mark}** have **[diverg]{.mark}ing**
**interests**]{.underline}, [**[side payments]{.mark}** facilitate the
**[form]{.mark}ation** of an **asymmetric
[alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Side payments **[compensate]{.mark}**
the [**weaker state** for]{.mark} its
**[concessions]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the great power. Morrow's
(1991) model posits that asymmetric alliances provide different benefits
to the parties involved---autonomy to the great power and security to
the minor power.4 In exchange for security from the great power, the
weaker side can offer concessions, such as military bases or the
coordination of foreign and domestic policies that can increase a
stronger ally's freedom of action. States judge the attractiveness of an
alliance by comparing the benefits of the ally's ability to advance its
interests with the costs of advancing the ally's interests. [When the
**benefit** **exceeds** the **cost**]{.underline} for both states,
[they]{.underline} will [form an alliance]{.underline}. This
formulation, however, does not shed light on the extent of security
benefits for the weaker side when the prospective allies have
significant diverging interests. Indeed, the net value of an alliance
decreases when parties have diverged interests (Morgenthau, 1973;
Scarborough & Bueno de Mesquita, 1988; Snyder, 1997). I contend that in
many cases, [the **[security]{.mark}**]{.underline}--[**[autonomy
trade-off]{.mark}** alone leaves a [deficit]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the
weaker state's [expected]{.mark} net [gains]{.mark}]{.underline} from
the alliance. The [deficit]{.underline}, which is often a function of
diverging interests between prospective allies, [[can be filled]{.mark}
in through side payments that **facilitate** the **successful
completion** of an alliance agreement]{.underline}.

The use of side payments in interstate negotiations is well-known.
According to bargaining theories, [policymakers use side payments

**positive [induce]{.mark}**ment]{.underline}, [help states to
[**diminish conflict** and]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[reach]{.mark} an
[otherwise **unattainable**]{.mark} level of **[coop]{.mark}**eration
during negotiations]{.underline} (Aggarwal, 1998; Oye, 1993).
[[Parties]{.underline}]{.mark} can gain from the use of side payments
and issue linkages and are able to [reach **mutual [agree]{.mark}ments**
[when they have **different**]{.mark}ial [value]{.mark}]{.underline} for
two issues (Davis, 2004; Wagner, 1988). [For the wealthier state, the
military value of the alliance and]{.underline} the [anticipated
gains]{.underline} in foreign policy objectives [justify the cost of
side payments]{.underline} (Skålnes, 2000). [[For a weaker
state,]{.mark} side [payments]{.mark} offer a positive inducement
and]{.underline} a potential source of [external resources
that]{.underline} could help leaders to [[**ameliorate** the
**dilemma**]{.mark} in **domestic resource distribution**]{.underline}.

[In the **absence** of a]{.underline} shared threat or a **[common
objective]{.underline}**, great powers and weaker states are likely to
have different foreign policy priorities. They may seek external allies
for different reasons. [Great powers have **extensive**
**fo**]{.underline}reign **[po]{.underline}**licy [**objectives** with a
global scope than weaker states]{.underline}. They may wish to establish
their spheres of influence abroad and may seek a high degree of autonomy
or freedom of action in the periphery. Forming alliances in the
periphery allow them to acquire such freedom of action. The geographic
location of weaker states or their proximity to international conflicts
sometimes makes them strategically attractive partners to great powers.
Also, having the need to gain access to military bases may motivate a
great power to establish security ties with weaker states. Whereas great
powers may use alliances as a power projection tool, leaders in weaker
states may use external alignment to enhance their hold on power. For
many leaders in the Third World, regional rivalries and domestic
political factors, which are sometimes intertwined (Ayoob, 1995), such
as political instability, leaders/regimes' legitimacy and their calculus
for political survival play crucial roles in alignment choices.
[Parties]{.underline}, thus, sometimes [attach different values to what
they want to [achieve]{.mark} from [an **asymmetric
alliance**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Having divergent interests between prospective allies increases the
likelihood that great powers use side payments to form the alliance. The
likelihood of using side payments by a great power to cement an alliance
is a function of having divergent interests between the parties. Great
powers and small states can have incentives to form alliances for
different reasons, not necessarily driven by a mutual interest in
deterring a common enemy. [**Divergent [motivations]{.mark}** for
forming an alliance between great powers and small states are sometimes
[caused by]{.mark} **the [disparity]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} **their
[power]{.mark} capabilities**. Whereas a great power may use the
alliance as **a tool for power projection**, [a small state leader may
seek]{.mark} an alliance with a great power to obtain **external
[help]{.mark}** [to counter]{.mark} **domestic and regional
[threats]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} his **[[political
survival]{.underline}]{.mark}**. An alliance agreement may stipulate
that the small state offers concessions (such as changes in its internal
policies or granting military bases) to the great power ally. In return,
[the [great power can offer]{.mark} **a potential ally** an increase in
[security through]{.mark} an increased amount of **side
[payments]{.mark}**, such as **economic aid**, **military equipment**,
**arms** or **other logistical support**]{.underline}. The great power's
ability to influence its ally's internal and external policies enhances
its freedom of action in foreign affairs and enables it to pursue
desired changes in the status quo in regional or international politics.
[Given that the great power is likely to be **considerably wealthier**
than the small power, **[the]{.mark} marginal [cost]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} sacrificing **some [resources]{.mark}**]{.underline} (side

In forming an asymmetric alliance, the [autonomy-[security]{.mark}
trade-off]{.underline} alone cannot improve the net gain for the weaker
side. Such a trade-off [[can generate a deficit in]{.mark} gain for

[payments]{.mark}** [fill the gap and make **the trade-off**]{.mark}
**mutually [beneficial]{.mark}**[. Given]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[the
great power is]{.underline}]{.mark} likely to be [**considerably

[sacrificing **some**]{.mark} **resources (side [payments]{.mark})** to

great power and **a large gain** for **the small, poorer power** who

Side Payments: Side payments are positive incentives offered by one side
to the other in exchange for the recipient's concessions on
issues/policies deemed important to the donor. Foreign economic aid,
military aid, and loans are clear examples of such side payments.40
Aside from these obvious examples, side payments can take various shapes
or forms. For instance, during a negotiation process one party can use
territorial concessions as side payments to cement an agreement. [The
use of **positive incentives** in **interstate bargaining** is **no
secret**]{.underline}. States use foreign economic policies to influence
other states' behavior and to achieve foreign policy objectives. [This
is **a common practice** of "statecraft."]{.underline}

[There is **a [well-developed]{.mark} area** of [research on]{.mark}
**the use of side payments**]{.underline} (of which issue linkage is a
part) [in]{.underline} the [bargaining]{.underline} literature.
According to bargaining theories, [policymakers use side payments as
either **direct [monetary payments]{.mark}**]{.underline} (such as
bribes) [[or **material concessions**]{.underline}]{.mark} on other
issues (such as issue linages) [[to encourage
concessions]{.underline}]{.mark} on a given issue.42 Side payments and
issue linkages, if used to provide a [positive [inducement,
help]{.mark}]{.underline} sates to diminish conflict and to
[[reach]{.mark} **an [otherwise]{.mark} [unattainable]{.mark} level of
[cooperation]{.mark}** [during negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline}.43
[Issue linkages]{.underline}, as a part of side payment mechanism, [help
states]{.underline} to [solve **distribution problems**]{.underline},
arise when actors have different preferences over alternative possible
agreements, in bargaining situations. As Morrow observed: "a linkage
deal requires two issues that the sides believe are of different
importance. Each side receives concessions on the issue it believes is
of greater relative importance. . . \[if\] done properly, both sides
prefer the linkage deal to going to war over the initial issue." 44

A state may offer various types of incentives to encourage otherwise
unwilling governments to cooperate with it. [Side [payments]{.mark} may
[come in]{.mark}]{.underline} the form of [**direct payments** such as
**[cash]{.mark} payments (or grants)**, [loans, or]{.mark} military
[aid]{.mark}, etc.]{.underline} Positive incentives can also be in the
form of indirect payments, such as unilateral trade concessions,
investments, etc. In an alliance negotiation [**the nature** and
**volume of side payments**]{.underline}, however, [will depend on **the
strategic value** of **the alliance** to **the more powerful
side**]{.underline}.45 I contend that [side [payments serve as]{.mark}
**a [compensation]{.mark} mechanism** [that closes]{.mark} the
**[deficit]{.mark} in net gains**]{.underline} sometimes [[felt
by]{.underline}]{.mark} a member [(usually, [the weaker side]{.mark})
[of the alliance]{.mark}. Side payments]{.underline} sometimes [increase
**the scope of the alliance** to include economic and/or military
dimensions. For **a great power** considering an alliance with a small
state, **the strategic value** of the alliance may justify **the cost of
side payments**]{.underline}; for the small state gains involve both
economic and strategic dimensions at the expense of concessions on
issues deemed important to the great power.46 This study probes the
conditions under which side payments are used as a bargaining tool in
asymmetric alliances.

Space Alliance, 6-28-2010, accessed on 6-25-2022, NBC News, "The right
and wrong stuff for space cooperation",
<https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna37986760#.XVwyN-hJHbE>, HBisevac)

President Barack Obama\'s space policy paper stresses international
cooperation as a means of advancing national goals in space. But [when
are]{.underline} these [**heavenly marriages** advantageous to
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, and [when
might they be so **harmful** that]{.underline} \"[going it
**alone**]{.underline}\" [is **preferable**?]{.underline}

The 14-page report, released Monday, says that spaceflight has already
become multinational because of the growth of national (and commercial)
players, and the wide array of teaming among these players for different
activities. The report's brief introduction ends with a "pledge of
cooperation," offered "in the belief that with strengthened
international collaboration and reinvigorated U.S. leadership, all
nations and peoples will find their horizons broadened, their knowledge
enhanced, and their lives greatly improved."

But these fine words collide with still-powerful international distrust,
exemplified by the recent flap over China's role as a potential partner.
Last week, NASA had to deny a report that the Russians were inviting the
Chinese to become players on the International Space Station, based on
their expected ability to docking their own crewed spacecraft to the
outpost.

That same week, widespread objections followed the announcement of
China's participation at a NASA-sponsored world conclave on coordination
of each country's space programs.

And now [the White House]{.underline} policy paper prominently [lists
expansion of international cooperation as]{.underline} one of the [**top
goals** of the U.S. space program]{.underline}. Such cooperation has
proven useful in the past. [But expanding cooperation merely for the
sake of cooperating]{.underline}, as a goal in itself rather than a
means toward a goal, [can become an **empty**]{.underline}
([but]{.underline} potentially **[costly]{.underline}**)
**[gesture]{.underline}**.

The goals described in the White House report appear more realistic and
reassuring. The three main aims are to strengthen U.S. space leadership,
identify candidate projects that would benefit from international
partners, and dispel misconceptions around the world about U.S.
intentions in space through greater transparency and confidence-building
measures. These seem to be reasonable and valuable efforts.

Bogus promises of the past

In assessing which future projects could benefit from which candidate
partners, it\'s useful to assess the international track record in
space. Old partners such as the Europeans, Canadians and Japanese have
proved their worth. They stuck to joint projects even after
Washington\'s course changes and delays multiplied the costs and
difficulties enormously.

But how about the Russians? Did they really \"save\" the International
Space Station, or were they more trouble than they were worth? That
question requires a cold-blooded calculation of costs and benefits.

The surprisingly heart-warming result is that for this project, the
internationalist choice --- including the Russian role --- was the
correct one, but for all the wrong reasons. This time, the United States
was lucky. For other projects now under consideration, the \"right
reasons\" must be understood from the beginning, and not just turn up by
good fortune and dumb luck.

First of all, the Russian space alliance didn't make the project faster
or cheaper, as was promised when the alliance was forged in 1993.
Experience verified what spaceflight guru Norm Augustine observed at the
beginning: "I [have yet to see a **joint international program** that
saves any **money**]{.underline}."

The [costs to the U.S. side were **significant**]{.underline} but have
rarely mentioned by NASA. In order to reach a compatible orbit to build
the station, space shuttles had to steer so far northward from Florida
that they lost up to a third of their cargo-carrying capacity. This
required many extra flights --- at well over half a billion dollars
apiece --- to carry hardware that could have been stowed aboard shuttles
heading toward the originally planned orbit. At liftoff, it also
required a more severe atmospheric climb that put added stress on the
shuttle's insulation system.

Nor are there any real signs that the Russian participation made the
station particularly \"better.\" All the revolutionary design features
that differentiated the International Space Station from every previous
orbital outpost --- Skylab, Salyut, Mir --- were invented by the
American side. These included reprogammable laptop-controllers for
changing equipment configurations, massive power and thermal control
systems, high-speed communications links that enabled ground scientists
to directly operate on board equipment, and even doorways that were big
enough to permit the transfer of refrigerator-sized equipment modules
into the station and between the modules.

As to learning from the previous Russian experience with long
spaceflights, the NASA teams observed and respected their Russian
colleagues, and then figured it all out on their own pretty quickly.

Sending hundreds of millions of dollars to Russia in the mid-1990s was
also supposed to prevent a flood of unemployed rocket scientists from
seeking work overseas for \"rogue state\" missile programs. But the
people who got the money weren't missile builders at all, they were
space designers. And by the time the money began to arrive, the real
missile builders had already been laid off by the hundreds of thousands.
There were always more than enough unemployed Russian rocketeers for
hire overseas, and they had no trouble \"following the money.\" The
limitation was in the budgets and domestic industry of those would-be
missile nations.

Making friends in orbit

[One of the most **persistent** and **pernicious mythical benefits** of
international space partnerships is that it promotes **peace** on
Earth]{.underline}. That is, embarking on a complex and expensive joint
space project actually tames the governments of unfriendly nations.

The [Apollo-Soyuz]{.underline} linkup in 1975 [is often portrayed as
**inspiring politicians**]{.underline} in Moscow and Washington [to end
the Cold War]{.underline}. The [space shuttle dockings]{.underline} with
Russia\'s Mir in the late 1990s, and the subsequent Russian amalgamation
into the International Space Station, [were]{.underline} likewise
[portrayed as **forcing earthside diplomats** to be **nicer** to each
other]{.underline}.

Top NASA astronaut Charlie Precourt proclaimed in 1998 that the
partnership would force politicians to resolve disputes \"that otherwise
they wouldn\'t.\"

\"They'll look up there and say, 'Well, we have an investment in that,
too. We have to keep this relationship going in a proper direction,'
rather than doing something rash," Precourt predicted.

**[In reality]{.underline}**, [joint space projects]{.underline}
actually **[follow]{.underline}** --- **[rather than
cause]{.underline}** --- [**relaxations** of tensions]{.underline}. They
are [often **performed** to **illustrate**]{.underline} the [new and
improved diplomatic climate]{.underline}. [A **rooster** may **think**
its **crowing brings the sunrise**]{.underline}, [but its performance is
the **consequence** of a larger phenomenon]{.underline}, and [not the
**cause**]{.underline}. The [same goes for the **bird\'s fellow fliers**
in the **astronaut** and **cosmonaut corps**]{.underline}.

#### The CP spurs a [follow-on merger]{.underline} into cooperation, but the [sequence]{.underline} of starting [first]{.underline} with unilateral action is key to [space innovation]{.underline}.

1.3.3 [[Competition as a **driver of better coop**]{.mark}**erative**
performances]{.underline}

Nowadays, space is no longer just the playground of politics; a
considerable importance is given to space exploration and innovation for
the purpose of science. The [ambitions are diverse]{.underline}: better
understanding of the solar system and its planets, search for habitable
planets, search for life beyond Earth... [These are large-scale projects
which necessitate important funding for research and development. [In
the world's situation]{.mark} discussed above, [where]{.mark} space
[**innovation** is no more a]{.mark} countries' [**priority**,
maintaining **competition** between]{.mark} space [agencies is a]{.mark}
**relevant [way to keep innovation in the center]{.mark}** of their
activities. "[Coop]{.mark}eration on a global scale [draws on]{.mark}
the [competences]{.mark} of the various partners, **created and
[stimulated through competition]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (15), tells Jan
Woerner on the ESA website. [Generally, each space agency brings to a
project its best capacities, in terms of technology but also of
qualified scientists. **[Competition is]{.mark} a [necessary]{.mark}
tool [to obtain]{.mark} a [fruitful cooperation]{.mark}**[.
Thus,]{.mark} competition and cooperation **[cohabitate]{.mark}** in the
post-Cold-War era]{.underline}, though the overall trend is to
collaborate to address modern space topics. However, if this first part
concentrates mostly on the traditional great powers, one cannot raise a
complete analysis of the space post-Cold War issues without studying the
new rising actors of the field. The impact of developing countries and
the private sector on space-related activities are at the core of
current and future preoccupations of outer space.

this economic revolution are already on our doorstep: **space data
capabilities are exponentially growing** elements of the 21st century
world economy.]{.underline}

Beginning with the dreams and funding by successful tech entrepreneurs,
enormous venture investments are already delivering wondrous benefits to
the world.

Commercial Space -- Profit and Non-Profit

There are really two major categories in the commercial sector, the
profit driven and the non-profit. The [classic for-profit companies
include]{.underline} not only those designing, building, launching, and
operating satellites but also [[the tech sector]{.mark} that [is
turning]{.mark} that raw]{.underline} [**space [data]{.mark}** [into
**gold**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[through **machine-learning**]{.mark}
**analytics**]{.underline}. Since for-profit companies are no longer
dependent upon the revenues generated by the Cold War space race culture
of a bygone era, [this new generation of space companies is able to
more]{.underline} **[efficiently capitalize on Moore's
Law]{.underline}**, [the]{.underline} nonstop [**exponential growth in
chip density**, and the associated networking technology co-evolving
with it. [This]{.mark} new generation [is building **profitable
businesses**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[helping]{.mark} to **clean
up**]{.underline} our **[oceans of garbage and debris]{.underline}**
with satellite surveillance, [reconnoitering to assist in enforcing laws
that]{.underline} **[[protect]{.mark} our [oceans]{.mark}]{.underline}**
from illegal, unregulated, unlicensed fishing, something that is rapidly
depleting the world's most valuable and essential lifeforms. [It's
leading in the innovative use of low-cost satellite constellations to
produce ubiquitous **[remote-sensing]{.mark} data**]{.underline},
enabling small business owners to be more profitable and less wasteful.
For example, [precise timing signals from space are already
**[optimizing transportation]{.mark}**]{.underline} of people, goods,
and services, [with even further gains anticipated with the introduction
of **[a]{.mark}**rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence]{.underline} to
assist drivers, perhaps even someday replacing them entirely.

[The non-profit sector is]{.underline} the other side of commercial
space, [concerned]{.underline} more [for the **general welfare** of
society]{.underline}, but every bit as integral to this new space
enterprise. Much [like every century]{.underline} before it in human
history, [ours is not without its unique challenges]{.underline}, some
of which have been a consequence of the last, and all of
[which]{.underline} the [[space data]{.underline}]{.mark} domain
[[can]{.mark} be leveraged to [help solve]{.mark}. **Examples are
endless**]{.underline}, but [one challenge]{.underline} that this new
space community [is]{.underline} uniquely well-adapted for is to further
inform **[worldwide resource allocation]{.underline}** for the 21st
century and beyond. [These two primary resources are]{.underline}
**[[sustainable water]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and the]{.underline}
**[materials]{.underline}** [needed for adequate]{.underline}
**[housing]{.underline}** [for [an]{.mark} ever-**[increasing]{.mark}
human [population]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As cities and urbanization
continue to expand, [governmental planning challenges such as
transportation design optimization for goods and services are only the
beginning. Additionally, through using inexpensive remote sensing
technologies, some members are designing space data analytics to
**mitigate human suffering**]{.underline} [from
**[plagues]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [contain **outbreaks**]{.underline},
[and combating illegal]{.underline} **[[poaching]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Some are connecting with other non-profits to curtail **human
[trafficking]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the sex trade or forced labor
for migrant debt repayment. Still others are helping non-governmental
organizations in their work to expose the use of children as soldiers.
[Addressing these challenges has little to do with resuscitating dreams
conceived by long deceased science-fiction writers and much more to do
with turning "swords back into plowshares" to]{.underline} **[solve real
[threats to humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Other non-profit initiatives include pursuing an even more foundational
understanding of who we are and how to be the best custodians of our
environment. [Much as exploring and monitoring the world's oceans has
advanced civilization through a better understanding of human life and
the planet, so too does exploring and monitoring from space. Low Earth
orbit ([LEO]{.mark}) [provides a]{.mark} unique [vantage point
to]{.mark} look back on the planet and understand what is
happening,]{.underline} anticipate what might happen and prepare for the
future. [In addition to]{.underline} [**[better understand]{.mark}ing
[Earth]{.mark}**, responsible and rapid exploitation of the low Earth
orbit domain will enhance the understanding of the **solar system** and
the rest of the **universe**]{.underline}. Small satellites already
offer low-cost platforms to study and explore what lies beyond the
Earth. Other members are pioneering the use of zero-carbon,
hydrogen-based reusable propulsion systems to ensure we don't worsen our
atmosphere using kerosene-fueled rockets for the coming tsunami of
satellite launches. Finally, [a mission [ensuring]{.mark} the general
welfare and]{.underline} **[[planet survival]{.underline}]{.mark}** [for
the next thousand years is finally [confronting]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[existential threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[asteroids]{.mark}
and comets [pose]{.mark} to humanity]{.underline}. These
extra-terrestrial, deep-space threats are passing dangerously close to
our planet, and today we have no solar map of them and no defense.

Risks of International Cooperation

Despite the many benefits, [[there are]{.mark} **implicit and explicit
[risks]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} international [coop]{.mark}eration. [These
include]{.mark} creating [dependencies]{.mark} between the
partner]{.underline}s, which might include partners being responsible
for different aspects of the mission [[where one]{.mark} partner's
[failure]{.mark} to meet objectives **deleteriously [affects the entire
mission]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

When planning missions, mission designers frequently chart the
organizational and developmental steps towards accomplishing the
mission's objectives. For project managers, this work breakdown
structure shows the project's "critical path" towards completion of the
goal. The longest time towards completion of the project is determined
to be the "critical path". [Where the project involves multiple
partners, as]{.underline} would be the case [in an international
partnership, partners run the risk of [crucial steps]{.mark} along the
critical path [fall]{.mark}ing [to]{.mark} the mercy of
**[foreign]{.mark} programmatic [constraints]{.mark}**, and thus
**[outside]{.mark} of their [control]{.mark}**. Losing control of the
critical path is another possible risk to international
cooperation]{.underline}7.

[**[Complications]{.mark}** also include an **[increase]{.mark} of
overall [costs]{.mark}**, perhaps [due to]{.mark} what economists would
call the **["transaction costs"]{.mark}** of international cooperation
-- costs associated with the choice of doing a project with
international partners rather than purely domestically.
[Examples]{.mark} of these transaction costs [include **flying**]{.mark}
**parts and personnel [abroad]{.mark}**, **scheduling [delays]{.mark}**
[from **foreign holidays**, **time and money**]{.mark} **spend
[assuring]{.mark} that domestic [procedures comply with foreign
laws]{.mark} and requirements**, and any other concerns which might not
happen were the project done by a single agency or country, and perhaps
even within the same field office or centre]{.underline}.

[International [coop]{.mark}eration also [increases]{.mark} the
**[managerial complexity]{.mark}** of the overall project, as the
**[mixing]{.mark} of [resources]{.mark}** [engenderers many]{.mark}
**legal, technical and programmatic [hurdles]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to
be discussed below. [[This]{.mark} complexity **[balloons]{.mark}** the
**[admin]{.mark}**istrative hurdles, [leading to **duplication**]{.mark}
of efforts and personnel. Additionally, owing to the dual-use nature of
space hardware and space-based assets, **technology transfer** and
**export control issues** will likely arise. The **sharing of
resources** and technology also creates the risk that a nation is
fostering the growth of industrial competitors whom might damage the
competitiveness of its own domestic industries. [If all]{.mark} of the
mission [objectives are not]{.mark} all [met]{.mark}, there is the risk
that the [coop]{.mark}eration [would be **seen as a failure**]{.mark} by
stakeholder (like]{.underline} the public, [governments]{.underline},
industry, or other interested parties).

While the Chinese have been slowly opening their manned spaceflight
program to the rest of the world, they have a long way to go before they
match the US or, for that matter, the Russians. [If China
does]{.underline} in fact [enter into a]{.underline} long-term
[[relations]{.mark}hip [with NASA]{.mark}, this [could be]{.mark} a
[good]{.mark} thing, but **[only if]{.mark}** the [US negotiates
from]{.mark} a **position of [strength]{.mark}**. Right now, fairly or
unfairly, the administration is seen as **weak**]{.underline}.

The Augustine committee report states: "If the U.S. is willing to lead a
global program of exploration, sharing both the burdens and the benefits
of space exploration in a meaningful way, significant benefits could
follow. Actively engaging international partners in a manner adapted to
today's multipolar world could strengthen geopolitical relationships,
leverage global financial and technological resources, and enhance the
exploration enterprise." Nice words, but not a very substantial basis
for policy.

The Bush Administration's approach was arrogant. They said, in effect,
"We're going to the Moon, and eventually to Mars, if you want to come
along, fine. Don't get in the way and pull your own weight." This may
have disturbed some foreign space policymakers, but it at least had the
virtue of being clear and reflecting financial and technical realities.
Unless there is a radical change in both US policy and in the shape of
the world's economy these realities are not going to change for at least
the foreseeable future; say twenty years.

As of now the Obama Administration is still making up its mind what to
do, where it wants to go, and above all what it wants to spend. There is
at least a possibility that the next NASA budget will simply reflect the
status quo. If there is a large cut to the budget then the plans may
change, but it will be difficult to durably change the overall direction
of the program. At some point, a little more than a decade from now,
America will send humans beyond low Earth orbit.

[**[Atmospherics]{.mark}, however, [are]{.mark} also
[important]{.mark}**[. If]{.mark} the [US is seen as **meekly
asking**]{.mark} the rest of [the world to]{.mark} please
[support]{.mark} the goals and ambitions of the exploration program, it
will be **treated with contempt**. This will not only make it
exceptionally difficult to come up with acceptable **international
agreements**, but [it will]{.mark} **almost [certainly ensure]{.mark}
that [the next Congress or]{.mark} the next [admin]{.mark}istration
[will seek to overturn]{.mark}** any unfair, unequal, or [humiliating
deals]{.mark} made by the current leadership]{.underline}.

NASA's experience with major international exploration agreements has
been mixed. The Apollo-Soyuz deal put together by Nixon and Brezhnev in
1972 and flown in 1975 was a bit of propaganda for the idea of
"detente". As Walter McDougall put it in his authoritative ...the
Heavens and the Earth: A Political History of the Space Age, "it gave
Soviet technicians the chance to traipse through US space facilities and
flight operations firsthand." That's something the Chinese can do today
simply by going on the Internet.

The Apollo-Soyuz flight was a dead end. Twenty years later, in February
1995, the Shuttle flew its first mission to Russia's Mir space station.
This was an early step in NASA's second great international program, the
International Space Station (ISS), and in spite of everything it has
been a technological success. It has taught NASA and its partners
invaluable lessons in building and maintaining large structures in
space. The Clinton Administration, which created the program, and the
George W. Bush administration, which largely built and paid for it, made
sure that it was recognized as a US-led program.

Neither of these projects represents a good or accurate model for the
current situation. With Apollo-Soyuz the hardware already existed, so
modifying it for the "Handshake in Space" that was intended to symbolize
the end of the US-Soviet confrontation was not that difficult. The ISS
project was based on previous work done by NASA on Space Station Freedom
and above all on the need for Clinton to show some magnanimity towards
the Russians. Today Washington's political motivation for a US-Chinese
joint space project is pretty murky.

The Chinese have publicly laid out a path that does not require any
international cooperation. They could change their plans, but this might
upset delicate internal political or industrial arrangements that we
know nothing about. There has been a lot of speculation about the exact
motives that drive their human exploration program, but few hard facts
have emerged.

On the other hand, we know that [the]{.underline} Obama [Administration
and [Congress]{.mark} are chock-a-block full of [motivations]{.mark},
many]{.underline} of them [contradictory or confused, but all of them
expressed with passion]{.underline}. There are political motivations:
after all, Florida, Texas, and California are all big voter-rich states.
[There [are]{.mark} questions of **prestige** and **international
[power]{.mark}**. There are industrial, scientific, and technological
reasons why leaders in Washington think that this is important. There is
a strong desire on the part of both parties to use NASA's
accomplishments as a way to inspire]{.underline} kids to study science
and engineering.

[In all of NASA's programs]{.underline}, ever since the Eisenhower days,
[there has been an element of "soft power".]{.underline} Some
administrations have used it more effectively than others, but it has
always been there. [Yet this kind of power is only a tool, not a goal in
itself. [If]{.mark} the [US presents]{.mark} itself [as **too eager
for**]{.mark} **partnership [agreements]{.mark}** [or **too weak** to
explore]{.mark} the solar system **[without assistance]{.mark}**, then
the world and the **[America]{.mark}n people [will only see
softness]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Fiat can't solve\-\--politicization crushes [morale]{.underline} and causes [micromanagement]{.underline}\-\--tanks solvency

Jeffrey **Marlow 12**, Geobiologist at Harvard University, Founder of
the Ad Astra Academy, "IS SPACE GETTING TOO POLITICIZED?", Wired,
6/6/2012,
https://www.wired.com/2012/06/is-space-getting-too-politicized/

Oesterle's characterization of Obama's political calculus reflects a
recent trend: [despite widespread public support for space exploration,
recent polls suggest that the issue is getting **increasingly
polarized**]{.underline}. The overall percentage of the American
population supporting the enterprise remained roughly constant between
2008 and 2010 according to the National Opinion Research Center, but the
groups declaring that the government spent "too little" or "too much"
both grew by about 5 percentage points.

[This is an alarming development, because]{.underline} manned
[[space]{.mark}flight seems to [**work best** when]{.mark} it's
**de-politicized**, or]{.underline}, perhaps more accurately,
[**[de-partisanized]{.mark}**. Space exploration is [a **long game**: it
**requires**]{.mark} long-term planning and a **[consistent]{.mark}**
goal-driven [trajectory]{.mark} that builds on previous accomplishments.
It's difficult to fold this reality into the "what have you done for me
lately?" culture of Washington]{.underline}, where failure to hit
quarterly benchmarks is grounds for cancellation. Of course,
[government-sponsored [space]{.mark} exploration]{.underline} also
[[requires]{.mark} **public [support]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and
mobilizing enthusiasm without stoking partisanship is a fine line
indeed.

If space exploration is something that we decide is worthwhile (and
apparently it is), then the best policy is often to let previous plans
germinate. As administrations come and go, the long term path will
rarely be exactly what current leaders had in mind, but it's better to
make some progress toward a palatable destination than to make no
progress toward the ideal one. This approach runs counter to the
political impulse to exert strong opinions on every aspect of public
life, the principle that if it's possible to have an opinion, one should
be had, ideally if it's perpendicular to that of the opposition.

[Ultimately, constant [**course corrections** **waste**]{.mark}
**previous [investments]{.mark}**[, **sap**]{.mark} **institutional
[purpose and morale]{.mark}**[, and **deliver uninspiring
results**]{.mark}. Ironically, in order [to **make**]{.mark} **more
sustained [progress]{.mark}** [and **not be subjected to micromanaging
debate**, space]{.mark} exploration [might]{.mark} be [best]{.mark}
served by **[fall]{.mark}ing [off the]{.mark} political
[radar]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Side of the Moon: A Window of Opportunity for Europe and Global
Cooperation", p. 15-16 \[typo corrected\]

Conclusion A famous quote by Napoleon on China states: "China is a
sleeping giant. Let her sleep, for when she wakes she will move the
world." By now, it is clear that the giant has woken up and its space
programmes along with it. Over the last twenty years China has become
one of the larger spacefaring powers in the world. The descent on the
far side of the Moon was not only a historic achievement in space
exploration, but also a strong signal and concrete expression of China's
rising capabilities to the rest of the world. Moreover, China is only in
its infancy of its space capabilities, and is expected to further emerge
as a major spacefaring nation, potentially even as the major spacefaring
power. China is notorious for its rather mysterious structural
organisation. The same applies for its space policy. A strong military
tradition negatively affected China's reputation in international
relations. A trait which was moreover amplified after the ASAT incident
of 2007. However, [China is visibly not interested in a new space
race]{.underline}. Although the nation seeks to gain prominence in space
with its recent achievements on the Moon, [China desires to engage
extensively in international cooperation]{.underline}. This has made the
country an exciting place for international research. [In the current
US-dominated international space arena, two second-tier spacefaring
nations like [Europe and China could **mutually benefit** from]{.mark}
such a [coop]{.mark}eration. Europe [has a **lot of utility**]{.mark} to
complement the prestigious Chinese space program. A Sino-European
partnership could be [a **win--win**]{.mark} situation, [based
on]{.mark} their respective strengths: Europe's valuable
**[tech]{.mark}nological [expertise]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **innovation
[capabilities,]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} China's **fast-rising [financial
and engineering resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover, [such a
partnership would contribute to China's new international status as a
responsible great power.]{.underline} At the same time, [the associated
costs would **remain within Europe's space budget**]{.underline}. The
Sino-European partnership constitutes relations with the EU and ESA. The
two organisations overlap but are nonetheless separate entities. For the
more political oriented EU, working together with China offers the
opportunity to strengthen a European identity. However, as demonstrated
by the arms embargo and Galileo initiative, if Europe pursues further
cooperation with China, it will also run the risk of encountering
opposition from the US. With the upcoming Brexit however, the member
state with the most obvious transatlantic connection will drop out, so
at least the EU will become less susceptible to the US. Still, an
extreme reprisal measure adopted by the US, such as the suspension of
NASA's cooperation with ESA would be detrimental. A partnership with ESA
on the other hand, is less political but more science based and
technologically focused. Because of China's uprising space capabilities,
Chinese space science is new and somewhat lacks the space tradition of
the most established agencies. [ESA proved to be a reliable partner in
solving China's utility gaps]{.underline}. Taking into account the
stated sensitivities of a Sino-European partnership, limiting such a
partnership to ESA with limited involvement of the EU, would reduce the
political dimensions and prevent possible resistance from European
stakeholders or international partners. In such a configuration, the
contribution provided by Europe to China's lunar exploration would be
limited, and the downside would be the impression of Europe being only a
follower in future space exploration. While it would bring some real
benefits to the European space programme, Europe's overall position
would appear weakened in the light of the much more visible achievements
of other spacefaring nations, China above all. [A Sino-European
partnership]{.underline} thus [offers great opportunities,
but]{.underline} also [requires a balancing of conflicting interest.
Ultimately, the partnership is bound to be restricted. Such restriction
would however be lifted if [Europe could fulfil]{.mark} its **unique
[role]{.mark}** [as a **bridge builder**]{.mark}. International
cooperation has traditionally been one of the most striking features of
Europe's space policy. Cooperation is **structurally engrained** in the
inner workings of both the EU and ESA. [Through multilat]{.mark}eral
cooperation, [it could]{.mark} also **[bring]{.mark} the [US and China
together]{.mark}**. If it becomes a bridge-builder between these two
opposing forces, [Europe could **leverage**]{.mark} its long-standing
[partnership with Washington and]{.mark} its maturing relations with
Beijing. Europe could become a **[trailblaze]{.mark}r for a [global
coop]{.mark}eration** in space]{.underline}. Moreover, [its role would
**not be limited** to that of a matchmaker, as it would also bring
**active** European participation in a global cooperative approach to
exploration]{.underline}. [The area of **human [space]{.mark}flight**
[seems]{.mark} like an **[appropriate]{.mark} playing field** to achieve
this goal]{.underline}. A milestone in this area would be that of a
Chinese participation in the ISS programme, and international
participation in the CSS programme. A manned international lunar base to
conduct scientific research, would be another crucial stepping stone for
a unified, cooperative approach to a human Mars exploration. The Global
Exploration Roadmap is already a praiseworthy initiative in this regard.
Mars has been globally acknowledged as the final destination of
twenty-first century exploration, but its costs remain unfeasible
without a multinational or global cooperation scheme. From a political
perspective, [a global [coop]{.mark}eration [would **reinforce**]{.mark}
**the role of and identity \[of\] [Europe]{.mark}** [as a **centre of
gravity**]{.mark} **in international affairs**[, promoting cooperative
**i**]{.mark}nternational **[r]{.mark}**elations. The costs associated
with this policy would **remain affordable**, as they would be **spread
across** a number of partners]{.underline}. The greatest cost and risk,
however, would be time, as a comprehensive and enduring international
consensus might prove difficult to reach, and pursuing this strategy
will inevitably be slow. Moreover, windows of opportunity do not last
forever and must be seized before alternative, undesirable outcomes take
root. Instead of being the arena of competition it once was, in the
future, human space exploration should be intended as a catalyst for
global cooperation.

[In a **brittle world** without enduring strong international
alliances]{.underline}, the debate on [Europe's 'strategic autonomy' has
gained **new resonance**, but it should not shadow the [EU's
**unique**]{.mark} **key international [assets]{.mark}** [in the]{.mark}
**global [economy]{.mark}** [and **multilat**]{.mark}**eral order**.
Working with **global networks** to [**promote norms** and **public
goods**]{.mark} is [key to **push back**]{.mark} **on
[nationalism]{.mark}**, the rise of **geopolitics** and
**transactionalism**.]{.underline} Strategic autonomy' and
'complementarity with NATO' usually appear in the same sentence in the
European debate -- the latest doctrinal iteration to be found in the EU
Global Strategy of June 2016. The ensemble reflects Europe's need to
rely on its transatlantic relationship for security and territorial
defence, empowering it to carry out foreign policy too. The EU's
greatest foreign policy achievement of enlarging to Central Europe after
the Cold War, pursued in tandem with NATO expansion, is testimony to
this pairing. Since the end of 2016, the US President's international
preferences undermine directly or indirectly Europe's security. Whether
it is the insistence on greater burden-sharing, US action in the Middle
East, or trade disputes with China, current US policies put Europe's
security -- already challenged by Russian action in Eastern Europe and
the Middle East -- at risk. European leaders have started to question
whether the transatlantic relationship needs to be preserved no matter
what, or whether Europe should emancipate from it. [The debate on
'strategic autonomy']{.underline} is animating recent efforts in the
field of security and defence. It [refers to the ability to make and
carry out decisions on **defence**, to conduct **[military
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}** autonomously, and to have the **industrial
capabilities** to do so. Even if]{.underline} this level of strategic
autonomy were [agreed upon, it would take a **generation** for Europe to
affect the world stage]{.underline}. [The focus]{.underline} on
strategic autonomy [[speak]{.mark}s to]{.underline} present
[insecurities in Europe]{.underline}an societies, [but [not to]{.mark}
the EU's **international [legitimacy]{.mark}**
[where]{.mark}]{.underline}, possibly, [the
**[E]{.mark}**]{.underline}uropean **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion
[[has **better opportunities** to develop]{.mark} **means of political
[autonomy]{.mark}** which befit its **history** and **international
identity**]{.underline}. The emerging debate on economic sovereignty is
addressing for the first time the degree to which the EU can make
political use of some of its economic and financial tools, such as the
Euro as an international currency. After all, the EU and its Member
States remain the world's largest trade bloc and donor. [On the
multilateral stage, [Europe faces an **increasingly hostile
environment** but remains]{.mark} the **[best]{.mark} hope** [to
pursue]{.mark} **universal principles**, such as **human
[rights]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the [**rule of law**, which
**underpin**]{.mark} **the [resilience]{.mark}** of that **multilateral
system**. How to **partner with other countries and actors** around the
globe to **push back on attacks to international order** is no longer a
second order priority.]{.underline} If the way ahead appears clear,
achieving it is a tall order. The rationale for collective action for
the EU seems obvious -- the 'politics of scale', or to be stronger
together rather than weaker apart -- but historically difficult to
achieve. [The multiple threats and risks]{.underline} on Europe's
doorsteps [have only minimally bridged the strategic divergence that
continues to beset the continent]{.underline}, and the rise of the
populist radical right is beginning to undermine existing European
external policies, not to speak of a higher level of ambition. Looking
at global politics from a non-European perspective, how Europe's friends
and partners around the world will welcome a bid for greater autonomy --
politically, economically, and strategically -- still needs to be seen.
The EU's worldview that it has acted as a 'force for good' is not
uncritically accepted. After all, that ethical stand was also possible
thanks to the EU's belonging to a stable and hegemonic West. If Europe
wants to engage with the world and simultaneously strengthen its
strategic identity it needs to square some circles. [[Without giving
into]{.mark} the **facile [critique]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} realism and
[geopolitics render multilat]{.mark}eral principles [obsolete]{.mark}
and warrant hard-nosed politics, [Europe should **leverage**]{.mark}
**its [assets]{.mark}**, which are irrevocably embedded [in]{.mark}
multilateralism and **[coop]{.mark}eration**. **[Climate]{.mark}
change**, **[conflict]{.mark} prevention and [mediation]{.mark}**[,
and]{.mark} an **[open]{.mark} and fairer international [trade]{.mark}
system** [are among]{.mark} the [assets]{.mark} that the [EU can]{.mark}
concretely [work towards]{.mark} globally]{.underline}. To do so it
needs to engage flexibly with global actors, focusing more on multilevel
networks including civil society rather than on the traditional
partnerships between governments, some of which are no longer benign or
useful. Both will require a dose of humility in listening to
non-European world views and of pragmatism in seeking appropriate
strategies and paths forward. Last but not least, if
[[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} wants to imagine its own history of
prosperity, democracy and peace as still relevant to the debates taking
place in the rest of the world, it also [[needs to think abou]{.mark}t
the **[global]{.mark} future [sustainability]{.mark}** of
welfare]{.underline}, taking progressive politics outside national
boundaries and [engaging in a more global]{.underline} and open [debate
about public common goods]{.underline}.

3\. The Moon as the eight continent: boosting global cooperation

[Space has]{.underline} often [been used as a **geopolitical
tool**]{.underline}, not only in times of confrontation but also [as a
**symbol** and instrument of cooperation. Space]{.underline} thereby
[provides the opportunity to **connect** divided actors. [Using
China]{.mark}'s quest to the Moon [as a **tool to**]{.mark} **create
trust and [coop]{.mark}eration** [with a **reluctant** America]{.mark}n
partner, [Europe could fulfil a **unique role** as a **bridge
builder**]{.mark} between nations. International cooperation has
traditionally been one of the **most striking features** of Europe's
space policy. Cooperation is **structurally engrained** in the inner
workings of both the EU and ESA, since their very existence is the
result of multilateral construction]{.underline}. It is perhaps for this
reason that European stakeholders today maintain cooperative relations
with almost all other space actors worldwide. **[Through multilateral
cooperation, [it could]{.mark}]{.underline}** also [**[bring]{.mark} the
[US and China together]{.mark}**. If it becomes a bridge-builder between
these two opposing forces, Europe could **[leverage its]{.mark}
long-standing [partnership]{.mark}** [with Washington and]{.mark} its
maturing relations with Beijing]{.underline}. Moreover, [Europe could
[become a **trailblazer**]{.mark} for a **broader** international
cooperation in space exploration]{.underline}, possibly extending to
Russia and other spacefaring nations, such as Japan and India.39 [This
would [secure]{.mark} Europe's [**active involvement** without]{.mark}
facing the dilemma of choosing between mutually exclusive partnerships
or [being limited to]{.mark} provide [minor contributions]{.mark} to
multiple partners' endeavours. Being a bridge-builder would involve
**core European geopolitical skills and values**. Its role would **not
be limited** to that of a matchmaker, as it would also bring active
European participation in a global cooperative approach to
exploration]{.underline}.

[In addition to its **intellectual capital**, [Europe is the **only
power** with]{.mark} the [**critical mass** to **stand**]{.mark} **on an
[equal]{.mark} footing** [with]{.mark} the Chinese and [America]{.mark}n
giants. Taken together, European countries represent [the]{.mark}
world's [**largest trading block** and **exporter**]{.mark} **of
capital**. The common currency, the **Euro**, has emerged as one of the
world's **major reserve currencies**. Despite the EU's bumpy road,
bouncing off one crises after the other, the **economic and demographic
weight** of the continent is likely to be further strengthened. Finally,
[in]{.mark} terms of **[tech]{.mark}nological innovation**,
[**scientific output**, and]{.mark} **industrial and [financial
assets]{.mark}**[, Europe remains a]{.mark} **true
[protagonist]{.mark}** in the world arena. However]{.underline}, the
[failure]{.underline} to see Europe as a collective geopolitical whole
[stems from the fact that]{.underline} it often lacks a one voice system
and that [its achievements]{.underline} in the field of economic
integration [are unmatched in]{.underline} matters of [collective
defence]{.underline}, adding to the impression that it can do little
more than exercising soft power. This does, however, not mean that
**[[Europe can]{.underline}]{.mark}** no longer be a
**[[produce]{.underline}]{.mark}**r of [[**global governance**,
**shaping**]{.mark} **the global [order]{.mark}** as much as the US or
China. Europe remains [a **structural power**]{.mark} and it must be
**conscious** of its **great potential**]{.underline}.40 In creating
more Europe, at pain of having no Europe at all, [[Europe]{.mark}ans
[must]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[rediscover]{.mark} **international
[assertiveness]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to ensure its active
participation in the construction of the international order they want
to see. [[Space is a **playing field** where Europe can **achieve
this**]{.mark} **goal**]{.underline}. Since the beginning of the space
age, [space activities, and human spaceflight]{.underline} in
particular, [have proven to be domains of high politics, **geopolitical
value**]{.underline}, while also benefiting innovation, inspiration and
socio-economic growth.

With regard to human spaceflight, the joint astronaut training
programmes should be gradually broadened. Between 2007 and 2011, the
space agencies of Europe, Russia and China already carried out the
MARS-500 project, which was a psychosocial isolation experiment for an
unspecified future manned mission to Mars. American co-operation with
China in space, on the other hand, remained modest. A milestone in this
area would be that of a Chinese participation in the ISS programme, and
international participation in the CSS programme, of course the latter
is much more likely. A manned international lunar base to conduct
scientific research, would be another crucial stepping stone for a
unified, cooperative approach to a human Mars exploration. This has been
globally acknowledged as the final destination of twenty-first century
exploration, but its costs remain unfeasible without a multinational or
global cooperation scheme. From a political perspective, this option
would reinforce the role and identity of Europe as a centre of gravity
in international affairs, and promote cooperative international
relations. The costs associated with this policy would remain
affordable, as they would be spread across a number of partners. The
greatest cost and risk, however, would be time, as a comprehensive and
enduring international consensus might prove difficult to reach, and
pursuing this strategy will inevitably be slow.41 Moreover, windows of
opportunity do not last forever and must be seized before alternative,
undesirable outcomes take root.

Throughout this paper, it has been shown that [[China is
**willing**]{.mark} to cooperate on the international
level]{.underline}. This is not limited to a Sino-European partnership,
but also covers other international collaborations. For instance, the
science payloads involved in the Chang'e 4 mission were, in part,
developed by Saudi Arabia.42 More importantly, China also maintains
relations with Russia. In fact, the Chinese crewed space vehicle
Shenzhou, was developed after signing a deal with Russia in 1995 for the
transfer of Soyuz technology. In present times, a formal alliance with
Russia could also become tempting for China. It could change the current
US-dominated space arena, and establish a new bipolar world order. Such
a course of events would not only pose a huge threat for conflicts on a
global scale, but it would also leave Europe with little room for
geopolitical manoeuvring, forcing it to take a black or white stance
vis-a-vis the two poles.43 By necessity, Europe's foreign policy action
should be directed to prevent this scenario. [[Coop]{.mark}eration [in a
**highly symbolic**]{.mark}**al [domain]{.mark}** like manned lunar
exploration [could be]{.mark}come [one]{.mark} of the **[key
action]{.mark}**s helping [to **transform**]{.mark} the potential trend
of **[power politics]{.mark} competition** [into]{.mark} **more
[coop]{.mark}erative, win--win approaches**]{.underline}.44 The Global
Exploration Roadmap is an initiative with high potential in this
regard.45 While the document is not creating any formal commitments, it
does coordinate a global approach to space exploration. Most
importantly, it connects all major space agencies, including that of
China. Moreover, space has become an attractive indicator of China's
commitment to multilateralism, so it seems more likely that China will
look for even deeper international cooperation. Indeed, if Chinese
leaders eventually decide to embark upon a human lunar landing, it can
be expected that they will use and present this endeavour as the
antithesis of a space race. International cooperation in space is thus
in the best interest of China, if it wants to be recognised as a part of
the largest space powers.

With U.S. President Donald Trump [raising previously unthinkable doubts
about America's willingness to defend its traditional NATO allies, some
European leaders, officials and military experts **insist** the
Continent must do more to **defend itself**]{.underline}. "The EU for
decades has profited from the protection the U.S. has provided,"
Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to Washington who is the
chairman of the Munich Security Conference, said in an interview last
weekend with the Funke media group. "Today, this protection is not a
certainty anymore." [Proposals for more robust European defense range
from a series of Brussels-based initiatives]{.underline} on procurement,
training, and research and development, to the extension of France's
nuclear umbrella, to the development of a full-blown EU army, as
endorsed recently by French President Emmanuel Macron and German
Chancellor Angela Merkel. [Paradoxically]{.underline}, perhaps, [**the
biggest obstacle** to the boldest of these proposals might be
**NATO**]{.underline} --- the very alliance that has safeguarded the
Continent since the end of World War II. Opposition comes not only from
the U.S., which despite Trump's browbeating of allies to spend more, is
intent on preserving a 70-year-old framework that lets Washington call
the shots and put its interests first. [There's also pushback from NATO
political leaders who are keen to protect their own institutional
turf]{.underline}, [as well as heavy reluctance from self-doubting
Europeans]{.underline}. Proponents of a strong European defense insist
the stumbling blocks have more to do with political and financial will
than logistics. European diplomats and military experts who have
considered the necessity and possibility of a Europe-led collective
defense say that the EU's capabilities are vastly underestimated ---
including by many Europeans. Were the EU simply to mass its serving
military members it would have the second largest armed force in the
world --- a total of roughly 1.5 million service members --- with only
China having more, nearly 2.2 million. [Military experts point to at
least one conceivable approach that could deliver relatively **quick
deterrence against Russia** without help from Washington]{.underline},
[NATO]{.underline} or the U.K., [which is aiming to leave the EU this
year]{.underline}. Rough-sketched, the plan would require massing enough
conventional forces in Eastern Europe so as to force Russian President
Vladimir Putin, or his successor, to make clear any hostile intentions.
And it would require an extension of France's nuclear capabilities ---
the so-called force de frappe --- to provide a security umbrella over
the entire European Continent, with a confirmed large-scale Russian
invasion theoretically triggering an immediate strike. Yet, as
tantalizing as this sort of coordination and capability might be to
Europe's lonely hawks, [such talk has **barely moved** beyond
chit-chat]{.underline} in the non-classified "Public Square" space [at
NATO]{.underline}'s new headquarters in Brussels, where military
officials in uniform and diplomats in business suits grab coffee, take
money from the ATM, or pick up magazines in the press shop. And [that's
largely **because of the alliance** itself]{.underline}. [Under the
guise of avoiding]{.underline} "[duplication]{.underline}" [and
demanding]{.underline} "[complementary]{.underline}"
[capabilities]{.underline}, [the U.S. and NATO's political leaders
continue to put up strong resistance to the EU ever developing the
command-and-control capabilities that would allow it to operate outside
of the alliance's existing umbrella]{.underline}. At NATO, no one wants
to be seen discouraging greater EU military investment or cooperation.
[But the alliance has long **served as an excuse** for many European
governments unwilling to tap tax-payers for often unpopular military
spending]{.underline}. "[There is a certain **moral hazard** in the
classic economic sense here]{.underline}," said a senior NATO diplomat.
"[There are some allies who are incentivized]{.underline}, say, [to
spend more on transportation infrastructure or health
services]{.underline}."

#### EU self-sufficiency in defense is essential to check a laundry list of existential threats

Nick **Witney 19**, served as the first chief executive of the European
Defence Agency in Brussel, senior policy fellow at the European Council
on Foreign Relations, "Building Europeans' capacity to defend
themselves," 6/25/19,
https://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/building_europeans_capacity_to_defend_themselves

[The dilemmas that this paper has addressed persist largely because
[Europeans lack the]{.mark} institutional and political [capacity to
think strategically about their]{.mark} shared [geopolitical
situation]{.mark} and future]{.underline}. Neither the European External
Action Service nor the various European Council formations have the
bandwidth to deal with both the fundamentally important and the
pressingly urgent -- as recently underlined by the hijacking of the
scheduled discussion of China policy at the March 2019 EU summit by the
latest twist in the Brexit crisis. From time to time, the EU recognises
and responds to this deficiency through a one-off exercise such as the
2003 European Security Strategy or the 2016 Global Strategy. Both worked
well. [But between such efforts, collective [strategic reflection
lapses, centrifugal tendencies reassert themselves]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
-- in the absence of the time or mechanisms needed to address crucial
but slow-burning issues -- [the default option has been to
outsource]{.mark} the continent's strategic [thinking to the
Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Nuclear issues are]{.mark} perhaps
[the]{.mark} toughest and [most controversial]{.mark} matters that a
Europe with aspirations of strategic autonomy must find a way to grapple
with]{.underline}. But they are hardly the only ones. [After almost two
decades of [involvement in Afghanistan]{.mark}, it might be time for
Europeans to take collective stock of what has been achieved and at what
cost, and to consider whether their individual and collective interests
are still best served by treating their engagement in that country as
simply a tribute they must pay to Washington. The [rising]{.mark}
military power of [China]{.mark}, marked by its ever-growing global
reach and increasingly belligerent attitude [towards Taiwan]{.mark}, is
another issue that a Europe that aspires to take greater responsibility
for its own security cannot ignore forever]{.underline}. Presumably, it
is this vital missing element in any serious European efforts to take
control of their collective destiny that has prompted German Chancellor
Angela Merkel's recent references to the need for a European Security
Council. It may also be what French President Emmanuel Macron had in
mind when he echoed the call for such an institution in his recent,
widely published "address to the citizens of Europe". Fundamentally,
however, Europe's strategic vacuum may owe as much to psychology as it
does to institutional or political shortcomings. After all, it is easier
to fall in with Washington's world view than to conduct the sort of
European debates that must inevitably expose transatlantic and internal
differences. The old fault lines between Europeanists and Atlanticists
run deep, and have recently been overlaid by profound differences in
strategic outlook -- not least between those who look east and those who
look south. [When [some]{.mark} member states [see Russia as an
**existential threat**]{.mark} while others view such fears as little
short of paranoia, and when some regard turmoil in the southern
neighbourhood as something requiring proactive management while others
see no need for anything but fences, the temptation to despair of any
possibility of [agreement]{.mark}, and [to leave the leadership]{.mark}
responsibility [to America]{.mark}, [is]{.mark}
understandable]{.underline}. [Understandable, but **[fatal -- and
unnecessary]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The EU would never have got anywhere
if it confronted only issues on which there was unanimous agreement.
What has ensured progress has been the habits of solidarity and
compromise -- a readiness to expose and ultimately accept differences in
outlook and priority, and then to strike deals that may not totally
satisfy anyone but leave everyone better off than they were before. [So
[it is]{.mark} with the **[imperative of building Europeans'
capacity]{.mark}** to defend themselves]{.underline}. Proposals to
strengthen the European pillar of NATO in terms of force deployments and
capabilities, and to offer the US some level of operational
burden-sharing through a division of labour, will inevitably leave
different European constituencies feeling that one or other initiative
is misdirected, even retrograde. But they should embrace both, in the
recognition of the fact that collective progress towards a safer and
more autonomous Europe is possible only with efforts to address the
security priorities of all.

A final distinction is between cooperative and noncooperative games. A
noncooperative game has each player acting on his/her own. In contrast,
cooperative game theory involves players acting in unison as a coalition
to maximize some joint gain that is subsequently divided among coalition
members. [The **[devil]{.mark} is [in the details]{.mark}**
[because]{.mark} [how]{.mark} [to divide]{.mark} the **[collective
gain]{.mark}** is **[never clear]{.mark}** and can be done in **various
ways**]{.underline}. Even though this book is about transnational
cooperation, we rely exclusively on noncooperative game theory for a
number of reasons. First, all cooperative games can be expressed as a
noncooperative game. Second, a noncooperative game can encompass
cooperative or mutually beneficial outcomes along with mutually
deficient outcomes. Third, by eschewing cooperative games, we do not
have to impose a payoff division assumption that can always be subject
to question. Fourth, countries cherish their sovereignty and rarely form
tight, enforceable ties With Other countries that allow the collective
to act as one, as required by cooperative game. For example, [**[NATO
allies]{.mark}** must [vote]{.mark} unanimously [on]{.mark} **key
policies**]{.underline} ([for]{.underline} example, [membership

[preserving]{.mark} **[members]{.mark}**]{.underline}\'
**[[sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As such, NATO is a loose
alliance because allies can block undesirable policy changes or
decisions. Fifth, cooperative games require a good deal of algebra,
which we can avoid by staying with a noncooperative game representation.

It is on democracy, unsurprisingly, that the traditional debate on
values is most palpable. [Today, the state of **democracy** and human
rights **globally** is **poor**]{.underline}. Many see a waning
commitment to these values from the traditional bastions of the current
democratic world order. Yet this depiction hides a more nuanced picture.
While executive-level support for democracy promotion in its more
traditional homes has declined, its operational manifestation remains
largely intact. [Governments still channel a considerable
amount]{.underline} of financial assistance [toward the technical level
in this field]{.underline}. And various democracy initiatives, such as
Sweden's Drive for Democracy, illustrate how individual [[EU]{.mark}
member states have [acted]{.mark} [as]{.mark} [**champions** of
**democracy promotion**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This has sent a confusing
message and led to different responses from different parts of the
globe. Some have opted to approach this issue from a utilitarian
perspective, either by providing purely technical assistance or by
molding democratic models of engagement to the local context. Others
perceive the Western democratic model as simply one of many different
forms of governance. While Russia and China are not particularly keen
for a European---or, for that matter, Western---leadership model, some
[[countries]{.mark} [in Asia]{.mark}, like India, [and]{.mark} in [South

[find]{.mark}]{.underline} some [**[merit]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the
**[EU]{.mark}** being [involved in]{.mark} **[democracy
promotion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But these countries see such
investment as requiring a lighter touch and a deeper consideration of
local specificities. It is by sharing Europe's own experience and
adopting what the EU's outside partners often consider a less
patronizing attitude that Europe is recognized as a useful partner. So,
while [[there is space for]{.mark} the [EU]{.mark} [to **lead**]{.mark}

What does a collective vision of a global Europe look like from the
point of view of the demand side? And how can this vision be translated
into an operational program? The picture that emerges confirms that [the
[EU must develop]{.mark} a more **[flexible]{.mark}** and [**nuanced**
view of **responding** to **global challenges**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Outside partners consider [the EU the [**standard-bearer** for
**multilateralism**]{.mark}]{.underline} and, as such, [[a **natural
ally**]{.mark} in this environment]{.underline}. But [the
[verdict]{.mark} on multilateralism [in its current form
is]{.mark}]{.underline} resounding---even
**[[deafening]{.underline}]{.mark}**---**[[ambivalence]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Many Europeans regard it as an end in itself, whereas for other powers
it is at best a means to be employed for any number of competing
agendas. Its credibility is repeatedly put to the test when
nation-states undermine the collective interest if doing so serves their
purpose. In its worst form, multilateralism becomes a screen to hide
behind, leading to indecision and inaction. Multilateralism in its
current incarnation is seen as antiquated and out of touch with today's
globalized, transactional world. From the trade negotiations between the
United States and China to the ongoing talks over the conflicts in Syria
or Libya, multilateral organizations appear sidelined, outmaneuvered,
and irrelevant---overtaken by events and left to deal with their
aftermath. Yet as a tool, multilateralism also reveals its strengths, as
illustrated by the EU itself in its long journey toward closer
integration. Once clear boundaries and operational lines have been
drawn, [[the EU has shown]{.underline}]{.mark}---with the competencies
that the member states have given it---[that [a **multilateral
framework** can be]{.mark} a force for **[good]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
This is [nowhere more evident than in the EU's **trade** and
**economic** sphere]{.underline}, where Europe's whole is stronger than
the sum of its parts. The lesson here is that [[Europe needs to
**update**]{.underline}]{.mark} both [its [**internal cohesion**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[**multilateral doctrine** to be]{.mark}
considered [a **credible architect** for a]{.mark}]{.underline} revised
and more consensual **[multilateral global order]{.underline}**. That
order should be [based on a vision of **common political values** that
the EU and its outside partners can share **equally**]{.underline}.

However, [we live in a time defined by **uncertainty**]{.underline}.
Ideas once held as indisputable truths---be it the viability of the
Alliance or the European project itself---are now being challenged by a
myriad of internal and external forces, including the United States.
This means that non-nuclear [Europe]{.underline}an states [must remain
mindful of a reality in which they may not be able to rely on the NATO
nuclear deterrent]{.underline}. [Given a **resurgent Russia** and the
**shifting security landscape** at large]{.underline}, Europe cannot
afford to be without a plan. Yet, it is important to frame this
conversation in a cautious and nuanced way. With the suggestion that
Germany build the bomb and Europe undergo nuclear rearmament, the
current debate has taken an alarming turn. Should the worst come to pass
and the United States closes the nuclear umbrella covering Europe by
refusing to defend its allies with nuclear capabilities, European
leaders should not have to choose between deterring nuclear-armed
adversaries and NATO's shared values of restraint, rule of law, and
weapons of mass destruction (WMD) non-proliferation. A European nuclear
deterrent is reconcilable with European commitments to international law
(most importantly with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons). In this alternative future, France, one of two nuclear-weapon
states (NWS) in Europe, would replace the United States as the supplier
in the nuclear-sharing arrangement. Depending on whether this
arrangement would be sustained under the EU Common Security and Defense
Policy or within NATO, the United Kingdom, which plans to leave the
European Union, could opt in as well. France would pledge to use its
warheads to defend its European allies against a nuclear strike.
However, it would retain ultimate command over its own weapon systems.
[Some,]{.underline} such as social scientist Maximilian Terhalle, are
worried that France's arsenal, comprising almost 300 warheads, is too
small to deter Russia---and justifiably so. Nonetheless, [nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark} is [**not a numbers** game]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[Deterrence is **psychological**]{.mark} and exists in the mind of the
adversary]{.underline}. [To be deterred, [Russia must
**believe**]{.mark} that a nuclear [attack will be retaliated]{.mark}
against and will come at an **unacceptable strategic** and **human
cost**.]{.underline} Hence, [France and the countries under its umbrella
should focus on developing survivable delivery capabilities that can
penetrate Russia's sophisticated]{.underline} anti-access/area denial
([A2AD) network]{.underline}, such as air-launched cruise missiles
(ALCMs). Effectiveness, reliability, and readiness should be
prioritized. With this arrangement, the destabilizing effects of a
sudden loss of deterrence would be negated while complying with
international law**.** Since [[a scenario]{.mark} in which [France
assumes]{.mark} the **[role]{.mark}** of the nuclear supplier [**does
not** have to involve a transfer]{.mark} of command or
weapons]{.underline}, [the provisions]{.underline} of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty ([[NPT]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[would **not be
violated**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Said plan [would also **disincentivize
individual member states** from turning nuclear by **calming fears**
]{.mark}of **vulnerability** [and **serving** as]{.mark} an **[insurance
policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Additionally, [since the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would be removing its
weapons]{.underline} from military bases across Europe, [the
[total]{.mark} number of [warheads stationed]{.mark} on the continent
[would **decrease**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[underlining Europe's

It can be assessed that, firstly, [[cyber]{.mark}-[attacks]{.mark}
predominantly [fall **below**]{.mark} the [threshold]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
the **[use of force]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which implies]{.underline}
that [[collective]{.mark} [defence]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[clauses]{.underline}]{.mark} meant for armed attacks [are
**[incompatible]{.mark}** with]{.underline} most
[cyber-attacks]{.underline}. Secondly, [cyber-attacks are [often]{.mark}
[executed]{.mark} [by]{.mark} [non]{.mark}-[State
actors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although Article 51 UN Charter was meant to
regulate State behaviour, the inherent right of self-defence it reflects
is a separate rule of customary international law. 81 The latter
includes attacks by non-State actors, and after the 9/11 attack Article
51 UN Charter is also commonly read in that sense. Thirdly, the author
and [the [origin]{.mark} of cyber]{.underline}-[attacks]{.underline}
(State or non-State actors) [are]{.underline} sometimes [[**difficult**
to]{.mark} **[pinpoint]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [referring to the
**time-laps** between]{.underline} the [malign cyber-**activity** and
the actual **effect** of a cyber-attack]{.underline}. Establishing
authorship and attributing a cyber-attack to an actor or even a State,
without conclusive technical and forensic research is possible but is a
political act. Nevertheless, and although with lower (overt) standards
of certainty, attribution is nevertheless on the rise. Fourthly,
[[cyber-attacks]{.mark} aim to [affect]{.mark} the cognitive dimension
via [cyberspace]{.mark}]{.underline}. Often [these attacks do not have a
**physical** or functional **manifestation**]{.underline}, [making it
[challenging]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [conclude]{.mark} that the
**[territory]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} a]{.underline}n EU or [[NATO]{.mark}
Member State is **[affected]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The
**[EU]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [as an integrated and political
entity]{.underline}, [[has]{.mark} a **[broader scope]{.mark}** than
NATO which can be [used to **tackle**]{.mark}]{.underline} many issues
related to **[[cyber]{.mark}-[attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The [EU
**[competences coalesce]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} the [attributes]{.mark}
of current cyber-attacks]{.underline}, especially when related to
problems of attribution, [the **[virtual]{.mark}
[characteristics]{.mark}** of the cyber-attack]{.underline}, but
[primarily given the fact that cyber-attacks remain below the use of
force]{.underline}. In that sense, [the EU is better suited to respond
to cyber-attacks]{.underline}. The [EU is able to focus on collective
measures below the use of force including diplomatic]{.underline},
[economic]{.underline} [and other instruments]{.underline}, thereby
complementing NATO and not latently competing with it. However,
[while]{.underline} the [[current]{.mark} cyber [diplomacy]{.mark}
toolbox is a **welcome first step**]{.underline}, [it is
**[insufficient]{.mark}**]{.underline} as a coherent EU joint response
mechanism [as it **lacks focus**]{.underline}. [[To strengthen]{.mark}
the [EU policy]{.mark}]{.underline} related to a joint response to
cyber-attacks, [the [EU]{.mark} [response]{.mark} mechanism would [need
to **operate**]{.mark} **[separate]{.mark}ly** from **collective
responses**]{.underline} to armed attacks since the latter are based on
the inherent right of self-defence of Member States -- individually or
collectively. It should also operate separately from responses by single
Member States, which include countermeasures against the use of force.
Since collective countermeasures by the EU are not allowed, the EU's
joint response mechanism against cyber-attacks should revolve around
lawful though unwelcome proportional repercussions and retorsions,
including collective EU sanctions and issuance of diplomatic statements
attributing cyber-attacks to alleged perpetrators.

**[[alone]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And while there remain skeptics on the
causes of climate change, there is overall recognition that its physical
manifestation is affecting all. India is justifiably proud of its
admirable track record on climate change; yet it must deal with the
reality that over 40 percent of its labor force is employed in
agriculture. That is a serious vote bank for any politician. In this
context, reconciling cleaner agriculture with industrialization is a
political economy problem that trumps long-term growth. [[China and

operational could have serious economic implications. The Russians
recognize the importance of climate change because it is affecting some
of their physical infrastructures. But they fear the narrative will be
hijacked by overly politicized ideologies. Clearly, the EU cannot tackle
climate change on its own, nor can it build a fortress around its
effects. The union is simply not influential or rich enough to make the
world follow its lead. However, [[the EU]{.mark} does [have enough
**legitimacy** and **leverage** to give]{.mark} a sense of
[**direction** to]{.mark} the [climate]{.mark} issue. The overall
[message]{.mark} for the EU in this context [is to
**persevere**]{.mark}: find the areas where it can build support and
stick it out. [Leadership is **sorely lacking**]{.mark} in this space,
and [the EU's choice to fill that role is
**primordial**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Chinese]{.underline} president Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road
Initiative [(BRI)---a massive, transcontinental
mega-project]{.underline} utilizing economic, financial, infrastructure,
and other connectivity links to bring China and the world closer
together and propel China's soft power---[has now become the epitome
of]{.underline} American and European [fears of China's global
geostrategic designs]{.underline}. Western capitals have come to view
BRI, along with China's increased assertiveness in East Asia, as part of
China's grand strategy to challenge the Western-led and rules-based
international order erected after World War II. For them, a China-led
regional or global order would mean revising the rules of the game,
weakening international norms and institutions, and promoting corruption
and bad governance. Furthermore, Chinese economic practices could
further destabilize financially weak and politically unstable states, as
well as worsen political, economic, and social cleavages in these
countries.

Western capitals have come to view BRI, along with China's increased
assertiveness in East Asia, as part of China's grand strategy to
challenge the Western-led and rules-based international order erected
after World War II.

European countries are concerned that [[BRI will **worsen**]{.mark}
**existing [conflicts]{.mark} and internal divisions [around the
world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ironically, some of the major existing
conflicts are rooted in the historical legacy of European colonialism.
[[From **Myanmar**]{.mark}**'s ethnic conflicts** [to]{.mark} **tensions
between [India and Pakistan]{.mark}**, the European and Chinese roles
have been reversed]{.underline}, with former colonial powers seeking to
offset the negative implications of Chinese economic and political
actions in conflict-affected regions.

Back home in Europe, [Chinese [investments]{.mark} have **[sowed
divisions]{.mark}**]{.underline} between countries in Western Europe, on
the one hand, and those in Central and Eastern Europe, some of which
have formed a 16+1 grouping with China, on the other hand. In 2016,
Greece and Hungary refrained from criticizing China's aggressive actions
in maritime and territorial claims in the South China Sea. In June 2017,
Greece vetoed a joint EU statement at the United Nations that criticized
China's human rights record. Former German foreign minister Sigmar
Gabriel warned that "if we don't develop a \[European\] strategy
regarding China, then China will succeed in dividing Europe."

European governments also believe that [[Chinese]{.mark}-backed
infrastructure [projects are saddling]{.mark} developing countries from
Asia to Africa [with debt, which will]{.mark} lead to]{.underline}
greater Chinese political influence in those countries and [toward
a]{.underline} Chinese [model of development that
[ignore]{.mark}s]{.underline} the EU's [high social, economic, and
environmental [standards]{.mark}]{.underline}.

European governments also believe that Chinese-backed infrastructure
projects are saddling developing countries from Asia to Africa with
debt, which will lead to greater Chinese political influence in those
countries and toward a Chinese model of development that ignores the
EU's high social, economic, and environmental standards. [Chinese
economic [engagement in the **Balkans**]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as in
Serbia, [is creating alternative incentives that [move]{.mark} these
[countries away from]{.mark} adherence to [EU standards, which]{.mark},
in turn, may not only delay their accession to the EU, but also [**fuel
corruption**, undermine]{.mark} **governance [reforms]{.mark}**[, and
**facilitate state capture**]{.mark}. Europeans do not want to see
scenarios where [China attaches]{.mark} political [strings to]{.mark}
its economic [support]{.mark} to financially unstable countries,
particularly [in **Central**]{.mark} **and Eastern [Europe]{.mark}**[,
but also]{.mark} other parts of its immediate neighborhood such as North
[Africa and the Middle East]{.mark}]{.underline}.

U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy Stokes Sino-Indian Tensions

Unable to compete with the cash-flushed Chinese state companies that are
often willing to engage in murky deals with host governments, at times
flaunting established norms and even sanctions, the United States and
European Union have in recent years proclaimed their respective
strategies to deal with BRI: the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy and the
Asia-Europe Connectivity Strategy. The EU's connectivity strategy
emphasizes sustainable and international rules-based connectivity, and
fostering bilateral, regional, and international partnerships that are
"sustainable, open, inclusive, and rules-based." The U.S. Indo-Pacific
Strategy aims to create a "free and open" Indo-Pacific, borrowing the
phrase from Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe's Indo-Pacific plan. As
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, "We \[...\] have never and will
never seek domination in the Indo-Pacific, and we will oppose any
country that does." Viewing the vast expanse of the Indian and Pacific
Oceans as an area of strategic importance to the United States,
Washington wants to utilize a rising India as a regional balancer to
Chinese expansionism and revisionism in the Indo-Pacific.

With its geographical connotation that elevates India's position, the
Indo-Pacific Strategy is seen by Beijing as part of a broader U.S.
containment strategy against China's rightful rise to power in its
neighborhood.

The U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy has created new tensions with the Chinese
government. With its geographical connotation that elevates India's
position, the Indo-Pacific Strategy is seen by Beijing as part of a
broader U.S. containment strategy against China's rightful rise to power
in its neighborhood. India's challenge to China was underscored by the
standoff between the Chinese and Indian militaries at the Doklam plateau
in Bhutan in 2017. No longer diminishing the strategic challenge posed
by India, Beijing soon came to realize that it had to improve relations
with New Delhi to relieve Indian strategic pressure on China. In South
Asia and the Indian Ocean region, CPEC has reinvigorated national
ambitions in Pakistan, while conversely spurring competitive tendencies
with India, which is wary of China's expanding presence in Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh, and the Maldives.

Chinese Activism in Afghanistan Motivated by Terror Concerns

Since the high-level Wuhan summit in April 2018 between Xi Jinping and
Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, both sides have agreed to cooperate
on Afghanistan's economic development and to jointly train a small group
of Afghan diplomats. Indeed, Sino-Indian cooperation in Afghanistan is
one bright spot--- and a potentially positive step to help improve
governance, institutions, and security in Afghanistan---in the broader
relationship marked by mutual strategic distrust. This joint step
forward in Afghanistan, which took several years to realize, also shows
China could work with India despite the Pakistan factor. Yet, China's
policy move seems to be motivated more by its domestic counter-terrorism
agenda in Xinjiang vis-à-vis the Uyghur Muslim minority than by
development goals for Afghanistan.

Sino-Indian cooperation in Afghanistan is one bright spot--- and a
potentially positive step to help improve governance, institutions, and
security in Afghanistan---in the broader relationship marked by mutual
strategic distrust.

In the past, China sought to assist Afghanistan's economic development
and supported the peace process between Kabul and the Taliban as means
to stabilize the country---and it still does to a certain degree.
However, due to Beijing's limited influence in Afghanistan's peace
process and state-building, it became primarily motivated by internal
concerns that extremist ideologies in Afghanistan would spill over into
Xinjiang and encourage further terrorist attacks by the discontented
Uyghur population. Contrary to this belief, China's own repressive
crackdowns on Uyghur human rights are the main drivers of Uyghur
reprisals against the Chinese state---and not the oft-cited overseas
influence from co-religionists in Afghanistan.

To move the Afghan peace process forward, U.S. and European officials
have long wanted Beijing to use its leverage over Pakistan to pressure
the Taliban to join peace talks with the Afghan government. Beijing,
however, has been hesitant or unable to do so. The Chinese government
insists it does not have that level of influence over Pakistan or the
Afghan Taliban. Clearly, there are limits to what China is politically
willing to do to help reduce tensions in regional conflict zones. The EU
has a diminished role in reducing violence in Afghanistan or promoting
peace between Pakistan and India, and thus wants China to play a more
constructive role in the political settlements of these conflicts. But
Beijing has a mixed record on such issues, particularly when its
national interests do not correlate with the demands of the peace
process.

The EU Caught between the U.S. and China

The U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy also comes amid increased geopolitical
competition between major powers. European governments are concerned
about the implications of heightened U.S.-China tensions surrounding the
ongoing bilateral trade and investment disputes, as well as strategic
issues emanating from China's increased assertiveness in the South and
East China Seas, over Taiwan, and tensions over China's handling of the
North Korean nuclear issue. Any miscalculation could potentially lead to
the outbreak of a regional conflagration.

While the EU shares some principal concerns outlined in the U.S.
Indo-Pacific Strategy, it is keeping its distance so as to not attract
Beijing's ire. Although positions differ among European governments, the
EU has not embraced the revitalization of the Quadrilateral Security
Dialogue ("Quad") in 2017 involving the United States, Japan, India, and
Australia. Many European governments do not want to choose between their
traditional ally, the United States, and China, their leading economic
partner and major source of foreign investment. As Washington is on a
gradual strategic retreat from global affairs, China could be a useful
partner for European governments that also have to manage Russia's
spoiler role.

EU Competitiveness and Joining CPEC

Europeans' reservations about China are igniting a Europe-wide debate
about how to handle China's expanding economic and political profile in
the region. Many in Europe are anxious about Chinese investment
practices and relative economic competitiveness vis-à-vis European
companies. Chinese state companies investing in Europe seek access to
technology from European companies, leading the EU to call for more
stringent screening of foreign, namely Chinese, investment in the
region. Until recently, foreign companies were required to form joint
ventures with Chinese companies in order to gain market access in China.
Additional government policies effectively force foreign investors to
transfer technology to their joint venture partners, which significantly
tilts the competition in China's favor. Chinese state-owned enterprises
also benefit from hefty financial support from state banks, leading the
EU and the U.S. to decry Beijing's violation of free market principles
and fair competition. In April 2018, a group of 27 EU Ambassadors to
China signed a report criticizing BRI, which it said "runs counter to
the EU agenda for liberalizing trade and pushes the balance of power in
favor of subsidized Chinese companies."

Many in Europe are anxious about Chinese investment practices and
relative economic competitiveness vis-à-vis European companies.

Far from dismissing BRI, European companies also want a share of the
infrastructure and connectivity opportunities. The UK, German, and
French governments and private companies have expressed interest in
participating in the various energy, infrastructure, and technological
projects under CPEC. In a visit to China, French president Emmanuel
Macron told Xi Jinping that CPEC was good connectivity for the region.
The French government emphasized it hopes that French companies will
have "equal opportunity" to invest in Pakistan. The UK government
released a statement that "the UK is poised to be a key partner of
CPEC." The larger question is whether CPEC can be extended to other
countries given its political, economic, and strategic importance to
both Beijing and Islamabad. The Chinese government has publicly said
that it welcomes foreign participation and investment in CPEC, including
from India, Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and European
countries, so as to create an image of inclusivity with benefits for
all, though CPEC remains a China-Pakistan enterprise that is tightly
controlled by these two governments.

As Pakistan prepares to approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
for a financial bailout for its current account deficit and worsening
financial situation, observers have raised questions about the financial
viability of CPEC. As a result, Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan has
sought financial aid packages from many countries, including Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and China. European governments could
provide Pakistan economic and other assistance and urge high governance
standards for CPEC. Such external involvement could lead Pakistan and
China in the long run to be more transparent and inclusive in the
procurement process for CPEC projects.

The United States and European Union share common concerns about China's
global presence and possible dominance and thus should strengthen
transatlantic cooperation and coordination to address a whole gamut of
concerns arising from Chinese government's foreign investments, China's
military assertiveness in East Asia, and its political interference in
BRI countries. [The [EU can **leverage its**]{.mark} **reputable
political [neutrality]{.mark}**[, **diplomatic activism**]{.mark} **in
conflict mitigation**, [and **engagement in**]{.mark} **regional
[institutions]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} complement the U.S. realist strategy
and U.S-led security architecture in the Indo-Pacific. The EU should
[develop]{.mark} strong [partnerships]{.mark} in other regions [to
**address**]{.mark} **China's rise more broadly** and [the
**B**]{.mark}**elt and [R]{.mark}oad [I]{.mark}nitiative in
particular**. The [EU needs to enhance cooperation]{.mark} not only with
[the]{.mark} Indo-Pacific region, but also [**Eurasian countries** along
the]{.mark} Belt and [Road]{.mark} in order [to]{.mark} steadfastly
[promote]{.mark} its [high standards]{.mark} on sustainable economic
development [and good governance]{.mark} and to uphold the liberal
international order]{.underline}.

#### Nuclear war

Dr. Stephen **Blank 12**, PhD, Senior Fellow at the Strategic Studies
Institute at the US Army War College, \"Making Sense Of Moscow's Syrian
Gambit,\" 6/27,
http://www.sldinfo.com/making-sense-of-moscow%E2%80%99s-syrian-gambit/

Beyond that [[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} was and still [may be equally
anxious that the "Arab Spring" or some analogue of it [might erupt in
Central Asia]{.mark}]{.underline} where it even publicly voiced its
apprehensions about that in April 2011.\[xi\] [[Any]{.mark} such
[uprising]{.mark} might [spread throughout Central Asia and trigger an
**explosion**]{.mark}]{.underline} on a scale resembling or even
surpassing Syria's current travails. And there are analysts who have
publicly warned that such a revolution could occur under the inspiration
of Arab events.\[xii\] Moreover, Russian perceptions of disaster were
quickly confirmed as Libya fell into civil war and as it became clear
that Islamist factions might actually take power in one or more of the
affected Arab states. Russian discussions of the Arab Spring regularly
complain that these revolutions' likely outcome is an Islamist takeover
leading to a protracted civil war or at least civil strife as those
forces seek to impose their vision of a just society on their countries
if not neighbors as well.\[xiii\] [Since Moscow is currently fighting an
Islamic insurgency in the North Caucasus and fears for one in Central
Asia the prospect of other]{.underline} Islamist victories or [[civil
wars]{.underline}]{.mark} engendered by attempted Islamist takeovers
[[in regions where Moscow]{.mark} still [perceives]{.mark} as [its
strategic perimeter]{.mark} **might [evoke profound
nervousness]{.mark}** if not anxiety in Moscow]{.underline}. (For a look
at a video showing Russian attack helicopters of the sort being sent to
aide the Assad regime see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKr_eOk8mNk II
Strategic and Geopolitical Goals Beyond these compelling domestic
reasons for resisting the Arab Spring, Russia has equally profound
strategic objections to Western interventions in the Middle East. These
include but go beyond the belief that the West deceived Moscow regarding
Libya and used the UN resolutions on Libya to create a precedent as in
Kosovo for a war on behalf of democracy promotion, or, more cynically,
for French access to Libyan oil and gas. If the democracy virus could
easily spread to Moscow's restive Muslim south or Central Asia,
democracy promotion on the wings of NATO aircraft threatens Russia's
fundamental domestic system and great power interests. Since 1991
[Russia has professed that any regional [strife]{.mark} in and [around
its]{.mark} (i.e. Soviet) [perimeter]{.mark} not only exposes it to war
or at least significant threat, it **[might]{.mark} also [escalate
beyond]{.mark} anyone's [control]{.mark}**]{.underline} as in Iraq
**[[and trigger]{.mark} a [protracted war that]{.mark} could
[escalate]{.mark} vertically even [to the nuclear
level]{.mark}]{.underline}** if Russia is drawn in.\[xiv\] Alternatively
it could escalate horizontally if it spreads throughout the Middle East,
which Moscow still claims as its strategic perimeter. Given Moscow's
lack of confidence in Western judgments and suspicions of its inveterate
hostility to Russia, it is hardly surprising that Russian spokesmen from
Putin and Medvedev down have repeatedly threatened that intervention in
Arab revolutions could escalate all the way up to nuclear war.\[xv\]

Areas of Divergence and Recommended Mechanisms to Manage Tensions and
Crises

The development, testing, and employment of dual-use capabilities. [One
of the [most significant]{.mark} **areas of [tension]{.mark}** [will
be]{.mark}]{.underline} the [development, testing, and employment of
**[dual-use]{.mark} capabilities** that have]{.underline} both [military
and nonmilitary uses. Many]{.underline} space [technologies are dual-use
**in nature**: rockets]{.underline} are used to loft humans and peaceful
satellites into orbit as well as to [hurl]{.underline} conventional and
[nuclear warheads]{.underline} at targets on earth. Many satelli[te
applications such as]{.underline} remote [sensing]{.underline},
communications, [and navigation have]{.underline} both commercial and
[military applications]{.underline} and end users. [The
[commoditization]{.mark} of space]{.underline} technology and the
expansion of commercial activity in space [[are]{.mark} increasingly
**[breaking down]{.mark}** traditional [silos]{.mark} between
military]{.underline}, civil, and commercial [uses]{.underline} of
space, [thereby **blurring the lines** even further]{.underline}.

[The development of robotic RPO, which involves]{.underline} the close
[approach and]{.underline} potential [docking]{.underline} of two or
more unmanned space objects, [currently poses a significant challenge to
a stable relationship]{.underline}. Such [operations form the
**foundation of capabilities** essential to the next generation of
space]{.underline} activities, including on-orbit satellite servicing,
refueling, repairs, formation flying, and the ability to actively remove
large space debris. However, [they are also vital to]{.underline}
on-orbit inspection of satellites and intelligence gathering as well as
[co-orbital ASAT weapons]{.underline}. Over the last decade, [both the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China]{.underline} have
[conducted]{.underline} a number of [RPO demonstrations]{.underline} in
orbit, [which]{.underline} have [**heightened tensions** and raised
questions on each side about]{.underline} what [the **ultimate
purpose**]{.underline} is [for the other's development]{.underline} of
these capabilities.64

[A second area of tension]{.underline} over dual-use capabilities [is
the]{.underline} development, testing, and [employment of direct ascent
**kinetic-kill** weapons]{.underline}. Such [systems utilize rockets to
place a kill vehicle on a ballistic **trajectory** to **intercept** and
**destroy** a space object by colliding]{.underline} with it. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has been developing direct
ascent]{.underline} kinetic-kill [technology for decades. Although it
has used the technology for ASAT capabilities]{.underline} in the
past,65 [it currently does not have any]{.underline} acknowledged
[kinetic-kill ASAT programs and states]{.underline} that [current
programs are]{.underline} for [**missile defense** only]{.underline}.66
[China's activity]{.underline} in this area [has been more recent
and]{.underline} has [focused on]{.underline} developing and [testing
direct ascent]{.underline} kinetic-kill [technology for ASAT
capabilities, although it]{.underline} has recently [justified the
testing as related to missile defense]{.underline}.67

[In the case of a conflict]{.underline}, the presence of [operational
[ASAT]{.mark} capabilities on both sides [could]{.mark} be a **strong
[drive]{.mark}r** for **crisis [instability]{.mark}**.
Chinese]{.underline} military [[authors]{.mark} writing about space
doctrine [are]{.mark} **increasingly [focused]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the
**importance of [first strikes]{.mark}** against U.S. space
assets]{.underline} in order [to **seize the initiative** and deter a
U.S. attack]{.underline}.68 At the same time, [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is]{.mark}
increasingly [worried about Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline} conventional
[**ballistic [missile attacks]{.mark}** on carrier]{.underline} battle
[groups and land bases in the Asia-Pacific, [which utilize]{.mark} **ISR
[satellites]{.mark}** for targeting]{.underline}. In response, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is considering "**left of
launch**" capabilities that]{.underline} could [include]{.underline}
[**using ASAT systems** against Chinese satellites to disrupt
the]{.underline} ballistic [missile kill chain]{.underline}.69 Thus, [a
crisis scenario between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and China could include a **race condition** where [both]{.mark} sides
**[move to strike]{.mark} first** against the other's]{.underline} space
[assets, [which could]{.mark}]{.underline} cause the situation to
**[[escalate]{.mark} out of control]{.underline}**.

Transparency and confidence-building mechanisms for managing tensions
and crises. [The [prospects of]{.mark}]{.underline} banning or
[[prohibiting]{.underline}]{.mark} the development of [direct
ascent]{.underline} kinetic-kill [and RPO [technologies are
**slim**]{.mark}. RPO technology has]{.underline} many [legitimate
peaceful uses and]{.underline} potentially significant [commercial
applications. [Both]{.mark} the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and China are likewise [develop]{.mark}ing]{.underline} their direct
ascent [kinetic-kill technologies [as a result of
**strong**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but different, [national
[interests]{.mark} that are **unlikely to disappear** in
the]{.underline} foreseeable future. Moreover, [**[verification]{.mark}
challenges** associated with]{.underline} the [space]{.underline} domain
[will continue to **[impede any]{.mark} arms [control]{.mark}**
initiative]{.underline} that is [built o]{.underline}n bans or
[limits]{.underline} on deployment [of]{.underline} technology or
[capabilities]{.underline}.

[A **more promising** approach is to **focus on transparency** and
**confidence-building measures**]{.underline} for both direct ascent and
RPO. [TCBMs are a means by which governments can **[share
info]{.mark}rmation** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} help [[create]{.mark}
**mutual [understanding]{.mark}**]{.underline} and trust [[and
**reduce**]{.mark} **misperceptions** and
[miscalc]{.mark}ulations]{.underline}. Although not new, [TCBMs
**represent a shift** for]{.underline} the [space]{.underline} world,
[which has long focused]{.underline} its efforts [on
pushing]{.underline} for legally binding [arms control]{.underline}
agreements and treaties. [The recent report from the UN]{.underline}
Group of Governmental Experts, in which the United States and China both
participated, [highlights several areas for space TCBMs:
**[info]{.mark}rmation [exchange]{.mark}** on]{.underline} space
[policies]{.underline}, information exchange and
[**[notifications]{.mark}** related to]{.underline} outer [space
activities, **[risk reduction]{.mark}** notifications]{.underline}, and
contact and visits to space launch sites and facilities.70

[[Improving **info**]{.mark}**rmation** on activities in
space]{.underline} likely [**[holds]{.mark} the most [promise]{.mark}**
[for mitigating tensions]{.mark} in the U.S.-China
relationship]{.underline} in this domain. [[While determining]{.mark} a
satellite's **[exact]{.mark} capabilities** and [**function**
is]{.mark}]{.underline} still [[difficult, **SSA**]{.mark}
**capabilities**]{.underline} have [[developed to]{.mark} the point
[where it]{.mark} is]{.underline} becoming [possible to **[verify
actions]{.mark}**]{.underline} and activities in space.
[The]{.underline} U.S. [military]{.underline} already [maintains a
catalog of more than 22,000]{.underline} human-generated space
[objects]{.underline} in earth orbit, [much of which is **available
publicly** and]{.underline} also [shared with]{.underline} all
[satellite operators]{.underline}.71 [[China is]{.underline}]{.mark}
currently [[developing **its own SSA**]{.mark} capabilities
and]{.underline}, presumably, [its own catalog of space
objects]{.underline}. Russia, several European countries, India, and
many other spacefaring nations are also increasing their own SSA
capabilities, and most recently actors in the private sector have
started to develop such capabilities as well.72

[[As]{.mark} SSA [capabilities]{.mark} continue to **improve** and
**[proliferate]{.mark} to other countries**, it becomes]{.underline}
increasingly [possible]{.underline} that [[they]{.underline}]{.mark} may
be able to [serve as a new]{.underline} type of national [**technical
means** to [**underpin** bilateral]{.mark}]{.underline} and multilateral
political [[agreements]{.mark} on responsible]{.underline} and
irresponsible [behavior in space]{.underline}.73 [Such agreements should
be aimed at limiting]{.underline} dangerous or [**provocative actions**,
such as close approaches of]{.underline} national [security
satellites]{.underline};74 [**signaling restraint** for]{.underline}
kinetic [testing and deployment of new capabilities; and
making]{.underline} political [pledges to refrain from first use
of]{.underline} destructive [counter-space weapons]{.underline}.75

[A key challenge in]{.underline} developing these [agreements will be
[overcoming]{.mark}]{.underline} cultural and [**bureaucratic
incentives** for **[opacity]{.mark}** on both sides. In the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [the]{.underline} national
[security community has a deeply rooted **culture of secrecy** and
**unilateralism** in]{.underline} the [space]{.underline} domain [that
results from]{.underline} policy decisions made during the Kennedy
administration as well as [the consideration that space remains the last
domain where the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has a
decisive advantage. [For China, which sees itself as]{.mark}
**significantly [inferior]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the United States,
[[opacity]{.mark} in space]{.underline} activities and programs
[[is]{.mark} seen as one of [the]{.mark} **few [tools]{.mark}** [to
**offset**]{.mark}]{.underline} overwhelming [[U.S.]{.mark} capabilities
and [resources]{.mark}. Both countries]{.underline} also [have
the]{.underline} usual [**organizational silos** and impediments to
**sharing information** internally that are inherent to]{.underline} all
large [bureaucracies and undermine]{.underline} bilateral
[sharing]{.underline}.

[Both countries need to come to the realization that **[enhancing
SSA]{.mark} capabilities** and **increasing transparency**]{.underline}
on activities [in space [are in their]{.mark}]{.underline} national
[[interests]{.underline}]{.mark}. While some more exquisite national SSA
capabilities should be reserved for security uses, [there is
a]{.underline} much [broader set of]{.underline} basic [SSA capabilities
that are]{.underline} relatively [common among]{.underline} all
[spacefaring nations [and **essential** to **safe**]{.mark} **space**
[activities]{.mark}]{.underline}, including those of commercial
satellite operators. [Increased **[sharing]{.mark} of [data]{.mark}**
from]{.underline} these [capabilities and collaboration on]{.underline}
enhancing and [improving them will [result in **positive
externalities**]{.mark} that]{.underline} will [benefit all
countries]{.underline}.

4 DIGITAL PLATFORM AND ECO-SYSTEM OF SMART SERVICES FOR ADVANCED SPACE
TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT

[Advanced space traffic management]{.underline} (ASTM) [involves digital
platform for]{.underline} building an eco-system of **[smart
services]{.underline}** \[10, 11\] -- [to combine]{.underline} different
models and [methods for developing **new generation of space
systems**]{.underline}. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} working [[paper
submitted by]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n
Federation [at]{.underline} the 59th session of [the
C]{.underline}ommittee [o]{.underline}n the [P]{.underline}eaceful Uses
of [O]{.underline}uter [S]{.underline}pace (30.01.2017 -- 02.10.2017),
titled "Additional ideas on the set of goals to achieve Vienna consensus
on safety in outer space and the need for thorough understanding on the
modalities of consideration of complex issues related to space traffic
management, and justification of the great expectations of early
decisions in this field" [[may form a new legal basis
for]{.underline}]{.mark} developing [**[new space platform for
cooperation]{.underline}**, [suggesting]{.underline}]{.mark} the
following steps:

> • to create and agree the concept of traffic management in space based
> on thorough study of all problematic issues and economic risks;
>
> • step transition from ensuring safety of space operations at the
> level of documents of voluntary execution to the rules governing
> traffic in space;
>
> • [[to create a **single**]{.underline}]{.mark} UN-based [**[digital
> platform for monitoring and dissemination of
> information]{.underline}**]{.mark} [about objects and events in the
> near-Earth space]{.underline};
>
> • introduction of formal requirements for accuracy, completeness and
> timeliness of providing monitoring information about objects and
> events in the near-Earth space.

The main tasks of creating a digital platform for managing space traffic
are the following:

> • developing guidelines, standards and procedures relating to safety
> of space operations and avoiding collision of spacecraft with
> operating spacecrafts or elements of space debris;
>
> • development and implementation of rules for provision and use of
> information on the situation in space;
>
> • prevention of further generation of space debris and implementation
> of measures for safe cleaning of the near-Earth space from space
> debris;
>
> • control of the state of the orbital group in order to identify
> dangerous flight situations and develop recommendations for their
> parrying in operational mode;
>
> • provision of continuous updating of the space-time model of the
> near-Earth space;
>
> • development of recommendations on planning of orbital operations in
> order to improve safety of space systems traffic and movement of
> individual spacecrafts in the current and forecested space
> environment;
>
> • timely, complete, authentic and accurate communication of
> information about objects and events in the near-Earth space to
> consumers;
>
> • carrying out analysis of processes of managing spacecrafts as a part
> of space traffic control technology;
>
> • participation in planning and preparation for the launch of new
> spacecrafts and space systems in order to assess the risks for the
> expected period of operation, justification of acceptable orbits,
> correction of time for the launch of carrier rockets and boosters. and
> boosters.

Based on these tasks, the following key "smart services" can be
developed (Fig. 3):

> • smart services for ballistic models;
>
> • smart services for models and methods of data analysis;
>
> • smart services for planning at all levels.

The features of any "smart service" should be the following:

> • Ontology-driven Knowledge base -- which should contain a semantic
> network of concepts and relations of the domain area \[12\];
>
> • Autonomy -- the ability to continuously respond to events, make
> plans and achieve their fulfilment.

The platform will be based on mathematical models and methods of
ballistics, which should provide the following possibilities:

> • creation of a ballistics-navigation support system for flight
> control for a large number of multi-type spacecrafts controlled from a
> single mission control center;
>
> • methods of project-ballistic analysis and expertise of orbital
> construction of space remote sensing systems, communication and
> retransmission;
>
> • development of software for selection and calculation of parameters
> of orbits for disposal of spacecrafts;
>
> • improving methods for calculating dangerous encounters and
> parameters of evasive maneuvers for spacecrafts;
>
> • methods of ballistic design of space complexes for orbiting
> maintenance of spacecrafts in the near-Earth orbits;
>
> • improvement of methods for calculating ballistic schemes for removal
> of largesized space debris;
>
> • comprehensive methodology for predicting technogenic pollution of an
> area of 1100 (up to 2000) km with objects larger than 10 cm;
>
> • development of a methodological approach to assessment of safety of
> payload generation scheme;
>
> • improvement of methods and technologies for traffic control and
> prediction of dangerous encounters;
>
> • development of methods and technologies improving the accuracy of
> forecasting the time and impact point of unmanaged space objects;
>
> • study of the evolution of "clouds" of space debris, formed as a
> result of destruction of rocket and space equipment objects in the
> low-earth orbit;
>
> • improving interaction between organizations engaged in safety
> analysis and preparing and launching space-mission vehicles;
>
> • creation of space observing devices in the visible and infrared
> ranges for fragments of space debris in the low-earth orbit;
>
> • measures for prevention of the risk of collisions of functioning
> spacecrafts with formed fragments.

The development of [[the platform will]{.mark}]{.underline} make
possible to [[significantly improve]{.mark} the quality and [efficiency
of s]{.mark}pace [t]{.mark}raffic [m]{.mark}anagement [in]{.mark}
the]{.underline} context of constantly growing [technogenic pollution of
the [near-Earth space]{.mark}, namely:]{.underline}

> • maintenance of space vehicles of the Russian orbital group, as well
> as identified potentially dangerous space objects and risk objects;
>
> • control of implementation of the stages of spacecraft launch into
> target orbits, measures to remove the spent Russian spacecrafts, the
> upper stages of launch ve-hicles and boosters into the "dead" zones
> and into orbits with a limited life, assess parameters of the state of
> accompanied spacecrafts (including in non-emergency situations);
>
> • assessment, identification, forecast, analysis, and ballistic
> support of dangerous situations, including destruction of space
> objects in the near-Earth space, dangerous encounters of spacecrafts
> with potentially dangerous space objects, forecasting descent from
> orbits and ground impact of risk objects identifying time and possible
> impact area.

The next key element of the space traffic management is the data
analysis services -- aimed to improve technologies for analyzing flights
parameters of spacecrafts and their control systems, forecast their
functioning on the basis of accumulated knowledge base of flight data,
as well as monitor the state of elements of the ground stations. Figure
4 shows the structure and integration of these services.

The main functions of the data analysis services are the following:

> •  collection, processing and storage of information on flight data of
> individual spacecrafts and spacecraft systems;
>
> • forecast of operation of spacecrafts and space systems based on the
> accumulated knowledge base of flight data[;]{.underline}
>
> •  monitoring the state of the elements of the ground stations.

[[The proposed approach provide solution for solving the problems
of]{.underline}]{.mark} telemetric and information support for [[flight
control of]{.underline}]{.mark} manned and
[[automatic]{.underline}]{.mark} spacecrafts and [[space systems
for]{.mark} the benefit of creating the unified space traffic
management]{.underline} technology [for a large number of
spacecrafts]{.underline}.

[In order to create services for strategic]{.underline} and operational
[management of large-scale orbital groups]{.underline} of spacecrafts,
[[it is necessary to use]{.underline}]{.mark} models and methods for
allocating resources of ground-based and satellite spacecraft control
tools, as well as [[mutual maneuvering]{.underline}]{.mark} of
spacecrafts within the existing space technology capabilities (Fig. 5).

[[With the]{.underline}]{.mark} use of developed [[platform it becomes
possible to provide]{.mark} **modernization**]{.underline} [of the
Center for situational analysis]{.underline}, [[coordination and
planning to manage]{.mark} a large number of different types of
spacecrafts, as well as to support [interaction between
spacecrafts]{.mark} and ground stations]{.underline} for scientific,
social and economic applications. At the same time, [an **end-to-end
network of spacecrafts** and stations can be provided for managing
abnormal situations]{.underline} (Fig. 6).

In addition, within the platform, there should be implemented services
for target planning for groups of various types of spacecrafts, services
for mamaging of the spacecraft flight program, services for space-time
control of spacecrafts, services for planning the use of individual
elements of the ground stations and services for forming tasks for the
target equipment. The platform should support organization of tasks
redistribution in the spacecraft system in cases of unpredictable events
of an abnormal situation and the need for unscheduled evasion from space
debris. At the same time, additional services should be implemented for
issuing recommendations on redistribution of spacecraft functions within
the system (taking into account the technical capabilities of the
system) and for issuing recommendations on the use of the ground
stations for clarifying the spacecraft orbit in case of a dangerous
encounter.

Another important issue in developments of the space traffic management
is legal and regulatory framework. Since the space traffic management
technology affects aspects of international cooperation, it is necessary
to take into account not only the Russian GOST (State All-Union
standard), but also international ISO, CCSDS standards, and documents of
the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC).

CONCLUSION

The objective of the developed approach is to create new opportunities
for managing space traffic and resources of the mission control centers
for a large number of spacecrafts with different owners.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} proposed [[s]{.mark}pace [t]{.mark}raffic
[m]{.mark}anagement [platform]{.mark}]{.underline} and eco-system of
smart services [[will]{.mark} [provide a **comprehensive
solution**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the following tasks:

> • [continuous round**-the-clock control**]{.underline} of automatic
> spacecrafts in various orbits;
>
> • [cataloguing information on **space debris**]{.underline} in the
> near-Earth space;
>
> • [rapid identification]{.underline} of dangerous encounters;
>
> • determination of the time and area of ground impact for space
> objects;
>
> • coordinating the work planning for the ground stations and for
> spacecrafts of scientific, social and economic applications in order

>
> • analysis of the use of the ground automated control complex for

> • provision of round-the-clock continuous control of the Russian
> Segment of the ISS RS;
>
> • providing control of Transport Cargo Vehicles of the "Progress MS"

>
> • ensuring the conduct of scientific experiments.

Currently, methods and tools for developing digital platform for control
spacecrafts and and use of ground stations are under development.

[The main requirement is [to **manage large-scale orbital
groups**]{.mark} **of up to 40 spacecrafts**]{.underline} at [the
existing ground stations [including]{.mark} small, ultra-small and nano
spacecrafts that will be formed in a [self-organizing "swarm"]{.mark} or
"cloud" --[to make the]{.mark} Roskosmos [orbital group more]{.mark}
smart, open and flexible, scalable, [efficient]{.mark} and
reliable]{.underline} and also protect the spacecrafts from space waste
and debris.

[Russia and Western states **continued to cooperate in Space**
after]{.underline} the annexation of [Crimea. [**The ISS** has been
functioning]{.mark}]{.underline} normally, [with Western astronauts
travelling there in Soyuz spacecraft]{.underline}. Indeed, [since the
annexation in]{.underline} March [2014, [NASA]{.mark} has
[booked]{.mark} an **additional [seven seats on Soyuz]{.mark}** and
taken out]{.underline} options on [three more]{.underline} (Grush, 2016;
O'Kane, 2017). [The Cospas-Sarsat Programme is functioning
normally]{.underline} and [**[Russian]{.mark}-made RD-180
[engines]{.mark}** [are]{.mark}]{.underline} still [being [used to
launch US intelligence]{.mark} and military
[sat]{.mark}ellite[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although plans to replace the
RD-180 with a US-made engine gained impetus from the annexation of
Crimea (Ferster, 2014), the replacement engine is still years away. [In
2016, **the US [Congress approved]{.mark}** the purchase of an
additional [18 RD-180 engines: enough to last until
2022]{.mark}]{.underline} (King & Troyan, 2016).

[All three of the **commercial launch services** based on
Russian--Western cooperation continued]{.underline} to operate [after
the annexation of Crimea. Since]{.underline} March [2014, 12 commercial
launches for Western customers have taken place on Protons, 3 on
Rockots, and 18 on Soyuz STs]{.underline} (Space Launch Report, n.d.).
[[Russia and the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [continue to [share]{.mark} some
**[info]{.mark}rmation [on Space debris]{.mark}**[, with the]{.mark}
**US military remaining at the centre** of this]{.underline}
international [cooperation]{.underline} (Henry, 2018). [The two
countries]{.underline} also continue to [observe the ban on the
**deployment of nuclear weapons** in Space and,
notwithstanding]{.underline} President Donald [Trump's plans
for]{.underline} creating [a US Space Force, are refraining from
**testing anti-satellite weapons**]{.underline} in ways that might
create Space debris. As General John Hyten, the current head of US
Strategic Command, stated in 2015:

Kinetic \[anti-satellite weaponry\] is horrible for the world ... And to
me, the one limiting factor is no debris. Whatever you do, don't create
debris. (Billings, 2015)

In 2017, Trump redirected NASA's plans for human Space travel towards
the Moon rather than Mars. [NASA]{.underline} responded by proposing the
[Lunar Gateway]{.underline}, a [[Space station in cis-lunar
orbit]{.mark} that would serve as a staging point for]{.underline}
access to the Moon's surface as well for **[deep Space
missions]{.underline}** (NASA, 2017). Later that year, [[NASA]{.mark}
and [Roscosmos issued a joint statement on cooperation in]{.mark}
pursuit o[f]{.mark} [this]{.mark} objective]{.underline} (Weitering,
2017).

Russia and Western states are also cooperating with regards to natural
hazards in-and-from Space, including through the International Asteroid
Warning Network, created in 2013 to facilitate cooperation between
observatories and Space institutions in discovering, monitoring, and
characterising potentially hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs)
(International Asteroid Warning Network, n.d.). [[Russia is similarly
working with Western states in the]{.mark} Space [Mission
Planning]{.mark} Advisory [Group]{.mark}, an association of national
Space agencies that was established in 2014 [to 'prepare for an]{.mark}
international response to a [NEO]{.mark} threat through the exchange of
information, development of options for collaborative research and
mission opportunities, and to conduct NEO threat mitigation planning
activities]{.underline}' (European Space Agency, n.d.). Last but not
least[, [Space weather]{.mark}]{.underline} (that is [solar
storms]{.underline}) [[has]{.mark} [become another subject of]{.mark}
Russian--Western [cooperation ]{.mark}]{.underline}through the [recent
establishment of expert and working groups]{.underline} within the
United Nations system as part of the Space 2030 Agenda and UNISPAC[E+50
exercise]{.underline} (St. Pierre, 2017).

In short, both [the United States and Russia are still cooperating in
Space, and appear intent on continued cooperation.]{.underline} In April
2018, Russian President Vladimir [[Putin said]{.underline}]{.mark}:

> [[Thank God, this]{.mark} field of activity [is not being influenced
> by]{.mark} problems in [politics]{.mark}.]{.underline} Therefore, I
> hope that everything will develop, since it is in the interests of
> everyone, in the interests of all humankind. ::: This is a sphere of
> activity that unites people. (President of Russia, 2018)

Reasons for Continued Cooperation

There are a number of reasons for continued Russian--Western cooperation
in the Arctic and Space; reasons that overlap with each other. These
reasons are not of equal importance; nor must they all be present for
cooperation to occur.

The Arctic and Space are remote and extreme environments The first
reason for continued cooperation concerns the 'cold, dark, and
dangerous' characters of the Arctic and Space. In every region of the
world, natural factors such as geography, climate, and the presence or
absence of resources play a role in national interests and policy
preferences. In the Arctic and [Space]{.underline}, a combination of
remoteness and extreme conditions makes almost any activity very
expensive.

These high expenses, in turn, create an incentive for cooperation and
burden-sharing. [As]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin said in 2010: If you
stand alone, you can't survive]{.underline} in the Arctic. Nature makes
people and states to help each other. (Harding, 2010) Examples of how
states cooperate to overcome remoteness, extreme conditions, and high
expenses abound in the Arctic and Space. For instance, the
[[states]{.mark} which [contribute]{.mark} their
[sat]{.mark}ellite[s]{.mark} and ground stations [to]{.mark} the
[Cospas-Sarsat Programme]{.mark}]{.underline} all [[obtain]{.mark}
[much]{.mark} greater coverage and therefore faster notification of
distress signals than they could ever obtain on their own,]{.underline}
given the high costs of building, insuring, and launching satellites.
[[This]{.mark} then [saves]{.mark} them [money by taking the 'search'
out of search and rescue---a matter of no small importance f]{.mark}or
the Soviet Union/[Russia, the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, Canada, and France, [[which created
the]{.mark} CospasSarsat [Programme]{.mark}]{.underline} and have some
of the world's largest maritime zones. Similarly, all the states
involved in the ISS benefit scientifically and commercially from having
a laboratory in micro-gravity (Rai et al., 2016). Yet the cost of
building and operating such a large, multi-functional, and long-lasting
Space station would be prohibitive for any single state, including the
United States (Zimmerman, 2003).

States also have a shared interest in cooperation as an antidote against
conflict, especially in remote and extreme environments where military
preparations and activities can be punishingly expensive. The OSCE's
1992 Treaty on Open Skies enabled the verification of arms control
agreements. The Arctic Council was created, in large part, to foster
communication, build confidence, reduce tensions, and thus help to
prevent conflict in the post-Cold War period (English, 2013). The
greatest accomplishment of the Arctic Search and Rescue Agreement may
have been to regularise contact, and therefore confidence-building,
among the militaries and coastguards of the eight Arctic states
(Exner-Pirot, 2012). The creation of the Arctic Coast Guard Forum has
carried this development further. In Space, one of the motivations for
the Cospas-Sarsat Programme was to continue the cooperation and
confidence-building that had developed---during the Cold War---as a
result of the Apollo--Soyuz Project (Jamgotch, Knappet, & Carpio, 1988).
In the 1990s, the same motivation led to Russia being invited to
participate in the ISS as a full partner, despite the United States
shouldering most of the cost. [The recent [inclusion of Russia as the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' primary [partner in the Lunar Gateway is
a continuation of this policy]{.mark}]{.underline}---[taking
collaborative, confidencebuilding steps that reduce tensions and thus
help to prevent conflict.]{.underline}

The **[[compressed timelines]{.underline}]{.mark}** characteristic [of
crises [**combine** with]{.mark}]{.underline} these
―**[[use]{.underline}]{.mark}** it **[[or lose]{.underline}]{.mark}** it
[**[pressure]{.mark}**s to shrink timelines. This **dynamic couples
dangerously** with]{.underline} the [inherent difficulty of
determining]{.underline} the [cause]{.underline}s [of satellite
degradation]{.underline}, whether [malicious or]{.underline} from
[natural]{.underline} causes, in a timely way. Space is a difficult
environment in which to operate. [Satellites orbit [amidst
**increasing**]{.mark}]{.underline} amounts of
**[[debris]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A [[collision]{.mark}
with]{.underline} a [debris]{.underline} object t[he size of a marble
[could be **catastrophic**]{.mark}]{.underline} for a satellite, but
objects of that size cannot be reliably tracked. So a failure due to a
collision with a small piece of untracked debris may be left open to
other interpretations. Satellite electronics are also subject to high
levels of damaging radiation. Because of their remoteness, satellites as
a rule cannot be repaired or maintained. While on-board diagnostics and
space surveillance can help the user understand what went wrong, it is
difficult to have a complete picture on short timescales. Satellite
failure on-orbit is a regular occurrence19 (indeed, many satellites are
kept in service long past their intended lifetimes). In the past, when
fewer actors had access to satellite-disrupting technologies, satellite
failures were usually ascribed to ―natural‖ causes. But increasingly,
[**even during** times of **peace operators** may **assume malicious
intent**]{.underline}. More to the point, in a crisis when the costs of
[inaction may be perceived]{.underline} to be [costly]{.underline},
[there is an incentive to choose]{.underline} the [worst-case
interp]{.underline}retation of events even [if]{.underline} the
[info]{.underline}rmation [is incomplete]{.underline} or inconclusive.
Entanglement of strategic and tactical missions During the Cold War,
nuclear and conventional arms were well separated, and escalation
pathways were relatively clear. While space-based assets performed
critical strategic missions, including early warning of ballistic
missile launch and secure communications in a crisis, there was a
relatively clear sense that these targets were off limits, as attacks
could undermine nuclear deterrence. In the Strategic Arms Limitation
Treaty, the US and Soviet Union pledged not to interfere with each
other's ―national technical means‖ of verifying compliance with the
agreement, yet another recognition that attacking strategically
important satellites could be destabilizing.20 There was also restraint
in building the hardware that could hold these assets at risk. However,
where the lines between strategic satellite missions and other missions
are blurred, these norms can be weakened. For example, the satellites
that provide early warning of ballistic missile launch are associated
with nuclear deterrent posture, but also are critical sensors for
missile defenses. Strategic surveillance and missile warning satellites
also support efforts to locate and destroy mobile conventional missile
launchers. Interfering with an early warning sensor satellite might be
intended to dissuade an adversary from using nuclear weapons first by
degrading their missile defenses and thus hindering their first-strike
posture. However, for a state that uses early warning satellites to
enable a ―hair trigger‖ or launch-on-attack posture, the interference
with such a satellite might instead be interpreted as a precursor to a
nuclear attack. It may accelerate the use of nuclear weapons rather than
inhibit it. Misperception and dual-use technologies Some space
technologies and activities can be used both for relatively benign
purposes but also for hostile ones. It may be difficult for an actor to
understand the intent behind the development, testing, use, and
stockpiling of these technologies, and see threats where there are none.
(Or miss a threat until it is too late.) This may start a cycle of
action and reaction based on misperception. For example, relatively
low-mass satellites can now maneuver autonomously and closely approach
other satellites without their cooperation; this may be for peaceful
purposes such as satellite maintenance or the building of complex space
structures, or for more controversial reasons such as
intelligence-gathering or anti-satellite attacks. Ground-based lasers
can be used to dazzle the sensors of an adversary's remote sensing
satellites, and with sufficient power, they may damage those sensors.
The power needed to dazzle a satellite is low, achievable with
commercially available lasers coupled to a mirror which can track the
satellite. Laser ranging networks use low-powered lasers to track
satellites and to monitor precisely the Earth's shape and gravitational
field, and use similar technologies. 21 Higher-powered lasers coupled
with satellite-tracking optics have fewer legitimate uses. Because
midcourse missile defense systems are intended to destroy long-range
ballistic missile warheads, which travel at speeds and altitudes
comparable to those of satellites, such defense systems also have
inherent ASAT capabilities. In fact, while the technologies being
developed for long-range missile defenses might not prove very effective
against ballistic missiles---for example, because of the countermeasure
problems associated with midcourse missile defense--- they could be far
more effective against satellites. This capacity is not just
theoretical. In 2007, China demonstrated a direct-ascent anti-satellite
capability which could be used both in an ASAT and missile defense role,
and in 2009, the United States used a ship-based missile defense
interceptor to destroy a satellite, as well. US plans indicated a
projected inventory of missile defense interceptors with capability to
reach all low earth orbiting satellites in the dozens in the 2020s, and
in the hundreds by 2030.22 Discrimination The consequences of
interfering with a satellite may be vastly different depending on who is
affected and how, and whether the satellite represents a legitimate
military objective. However, it will not always be clear who the owners
and operators of a satellite are, and users of a satellite's services
may be numerous and not public. Registration of satellites is
incomplete23 and current ownership is not necessarily updated in a
readily available repository. The identification of a satellite as
military or civilian may be deliberately obscured. Or its value as a
military asset may change over time; for example, the share of capacity
of a commercial satellite used by military customers may wax and wane. A
potential adversary's satellite may have different or additional
missions that are more vital to that adversary than an outsider may
perceive. An ASAT attack that creates persistent debris could result in
significant collateral damage to a wide range of other actors; unlike
terrestrial attacks, these consequences are not limited geographically,
and could harm other users unpredictably. In 2015, the Pentagon's annual
wargame, or simulated conflict, involving space assets focused on a
future regional conflict. The official report out24 warned that it was
hard to keep the conflict contained geographically when using
anti-satellite weapons: As the wargame unfolded, a regional crisis
quickly escalated, partly because of the interconnectedness of a
multi-domain fight involving a capable adversary. The wargame
participants emphasized the challenges in containing horizontal
escalation once space control capabilities are employed to achieve
limited national objectives. Lack of shared understanding of
consequences/proportionality States have fairly similar understandings
of the implications of military actions on the ground, in the air, and
at sea, built over decades of experience. The United States and the
Soviet Union/Russia have built some shared understanding of each other's
strategic thinking on nuclear weapons, though this is less true for
other states with nuclear weapons. But in the context of nuclear
weapons, there is an arguable understanding about the crisis escalation
based on the type of weapon (strategic or tactical) and the target
(counterforce---against other nuclear targets, or countervalue---against
civilian targets). Because of a lack of experience in hostilities that
target space-based capabilities, it is not entirely clear what the
proper response to a space activity is and where the escalation
thresholds or ―red lines‖ lie. Exacerbating this is the asymmetry in
space investments; not all actors will assign the same value to a given
target or same escalatory nature to different weapons. For example, the
United States is the country most heavily dependent on military space
assets. Its proportionally higher commitment to expeditionary forces
make this likely to be true well into the future. So while the United
States seeks to create a deterrence framework, punishment-based
deterrence would not likely target its adversary's space assets. But
then there is difficulty finding target on the ground that would be
credible but also not unpredictably escalate a crisis. If an American
military satellite were attacked but without attendant human casualties
(satellites have no mothers'), retaliation on an adversary's
ground-based target is likely to escalate the conflict, perhaps
justifying the adversary's subsequent claim to self-defense, even if the
initial satellite attack didn't support such a claim. Little experience
in engaging substantively in these issues Related to this issue is that
[there is]{.underline} relatively [**little experience**
among]{.underline} the [major space actors in handling a crisis with the
others]{.underline}. [The [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the Soviet
Union, then [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, [have]{.underline} had a long
[history of [strategic discussions]{.mark}]{.underline} and
negotiations. [This [built]{.mark} up a **shared
[understanding]{.mark}** [of each other's]{.mark} point of
[view]{.mark}, developed relationships between those conducting those
discussions, [and]{.mark} created [bureaucracies]{.mark} and expertise
to support those discussions. [This experience and]{.mark}]{.underline}
these [[relationships]{.mark} are **[important to interpret]{.mark}**ing
[events]{.mark} and to **[resolv]{.mark}**ing [disputes]{.mark} before
they turn into a crisis, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} to
[**[managing]{.mark}** \[[crisis]{.mark}\] ~~one~~ once it begins.
**[There is nothing like this]{.mark}**]{.underline} level of
[engagement [around **space**]{.mark} **issues**
**[between]{.mark}**]{.underline} these two states, and much less
between [the **[US and China]{.mark}**.]{.underline} One of the
participants in a 2010 US space war game, a diplomatic veteran,
imagined25 how things would play out if one or more militarily important
US satellites failed amidst a crisis with an adversary known to have
sophisticated offensive cyber and space capabilities: The good news is
that there has never been a destructive conflict waged in either the
space or cyber domains. The bad news is that [**[no one around]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} situation room [table]{.mark}** [can
**cite**]{.mark}]{.underline} any history from previous wars, or common
[**[bilateral understandings]{.mark}** with the adversary]{.underline},
[[relating to space]{.underline}]{.mark} and cyber conflict [[as a
guide]{.mark} to what the incoming reports mean, and what may or may not
happen next.]{.underline} This is the big difference between the
space-cyber domains, and the nuclear domain. [There is]{.underline}, in
this future scenario, no credible basis for anyone around the president
to attribute restraint to the adversary, [**no track record** from which
**[to interpret]{.mark}** the **[actions]{.mark}** by the adversary.
There is **no crisis management history**: **the president has no
bilateral understandings**]{.underline} or guidelines [from past
diplomatic discussions, and **[no op]{.mark}erational [protocols
from]{.mark} previous [incidents where space]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
cyber [[moves]{.mark} and counter-moves [created precedents]{.mark}.
Perhaps the adversary intended to make a point with one series of
limited attacks, and hoped for talks with Washington and a compromise;
but for all the president knows, sitting in the situation room, the
hostile actions taken against America's space assets and information
systems are nothing less than early stages of an all-out assault on US
interests. Where to start?]{.underline} How to prioritize efforts Using
this lens, what does this say about where efforts around space security
should be focused? Start a substantive, high-level arms control
discussion Starting a credible high-level discussion will require
countries to identify key domestic stakeholders, assemble teams of
experts on relevant issues, and develop detailed policy positions. The
resulting **[[informed dialogue]{.mark} will [increase
understanding]{.mark} between countries]{.underline}**, identify
important areas of agreement and disagreement, **[[clarify
intentions]{.mark}, and [establish]{.mark} better [channels of

#### That solves global SSA coop

Action at the Council on Foreign Relations. "Dangerous Space Incidents:
Contingency Planning Memorandum No. 21" 4-16-14
https://www.cfr.org/report/dangerous-space-incidents\]

An ASAT test that causes unintended damage to U.S. and ally satellites
or [an **accident** in space caused by [**debris** could trigger]{.mark}
a [**major international crisis** between]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and
China]{.mark}. The risk is [heightened by]{.mark} the]{.underline} fact
that both countries have [no]{.underline} pre--space-launch
[notification arrangements]{.underline}, similar to the U.S.-Russia
agreement on notifications of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)
and submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) launches. [Management
of]{.underline} such [a crisis could]{.underline} also [be hindered
by]{.underline} a **[[lack of direct
communication]{.underline}]{.mark}** between U.S. authorities and the
PLA agency that oversees Chinese military space launches. Warning
Indicators As China, North Korea, and Iran\'s space capabilities
continue to grow, the following strategic and tactical warning
indicators would suggest that a dangerous space event is forthcoming.
Strategic warning indicators include statements of intention to
interfere with or develop the capability to interfere with space
operations of other powers during a crisis or wartime; evidence of such
intent, including research and development or budget indicators,
organizational changes, or intelligence collection; noticeably increased
efforts to disrupt space communications using lasers or jammers against
satellites or ground-based transmitters; or the sudden and unexplained
launch of additional satellites into LEO, accompanied by an increase in
aggressive or potentially hostile maneuvers. Certain indicators are
suggestive of potential military escalation or onset of conflict. These
include a heightened diplomatic crisis involving the United States and
China, North Korea, or Iran that could result in terrestrial military
escalation and trigger a crisis-related interference in space;
militarized tensions or direct conflict between one of the three
countries and the United States, a U.S. treaty ally, or a non-U.S. ally
with known space capabilities, such as India or Russia; or an internal
power struggle among governing elites in China, North Korea, or Iran,
prompting space activities intended to consolidate domestic power or
stoke nationalism. Tactical warning indicators tend to be more overt.
They include significant changes in the alert status or operational
readiness of military units associated with China, North Korea, or
Iran\'s missile or space programs; the unexpected announcement of the
closure of airspace to civilian aircraft over the territory of previous
space launches; or preparations for missile tests from satellite
launching stations which are usually detectable days, if not weeks, in
advance. Space launches from road-mobile missile units, although closely
monitored, would likely occur with less warning, if any. Additional
indicators include specific space-related warnings or rhetoric, or the
declaration of an antisatellite or ballistic missile defense test,
although no warning would be issued. The 2007 Chinese ASAT test that
destroyed an LEO satellite was not preceded by any specific warnings.
Implications for U.S. Interests The United States has three primary
national interests in preventing or mitigating the dangerous space
contingencies detailed above, which would threaten U.S. or allied space
assets and produce mass space debris, imperiling assured access to
space. First, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [depends on
space systems]{.underline} more than any other country, which is
[unlikely to change]{.underline} in the future. No other state spends as
much on its space activity (75 percent of global space funding is by the
United States), or has a greater stake in a safe and secure space (43
percent of all active satellites are U.S. owned). [Threats to U.S.
satellites would reduce the country\'s ability to attack suspected
terrorists with precision-guided munitions and conduct imagery analysis
of nuclear weapons programs,]{.underline} and could interrupt non-cash
economic activity depending on the severity of the attack and number of
satellites disrupted. Moreover, although space [debris threatens all
international space assets]{.underline}, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [**depends** especially **on
satellites**]{.underline} in the portions of LEO [**where** the
**greatest debris is found** for encrypted communications,
**[recon]{.mark}naissance** over Afghanistan, **[missile
defense]{.mark}**, and **other [missions critical to]{.mark}
nat**]{.underline}ional **[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Second, as
the most active global security manager with unmatched commitments, the
United States **[[would be more affected]{.underline}]{.mark}** by an
unstable or insecure space commons than any other country. In January
2012, the Obama administration announced its commitment to help broker
an International Code of Conduct on Outer Space Activities, which would
be an informal arrangement based on freedom of access to space for
peaceful purposes, preservation of the security and integrity of space
objects in orbit, and due consideration for the legitimate defense
interests of states. Third, as the primary guarantor of space access,
the United States has a strong interest in promoting responsible
behavior in space or at least preventing [[space
activities]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[have]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[potential]{.mark} to be]{.underline}come [a source [of
**international**]{.mark} **instability** or]{.underline} potential
[**[conflict]{.mark}**,]{.underline} in space or [**[on the
ground]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Intentional or crisis-related
[[interference]{.mark} in space [would]{.mark}]{.underline} undermine
the norm of equal access to space for all by introducing space as a
domain for crisis bargaining, as well as prompting its further
militarization---both of [which would [be **highly
destabilizing**]{.mark} to **[international]{.mark}** political
**[dynamics]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The U.S. Strategic Command\'s Joint
Space Operations Center (JSpOC) helps to protect the space domain by
providing conjunction assessment notifications to government and
commercial space operators when their satellites are predicted to
collide with other satellites or space debris. JSpOC gathers this
information with its \"space fence\" of ground-based radars and optical
sensors located throughout the world. [[Threats to]{.underline}]{.mark}
military or civilian [[satellites]{.underline}]{.mark} could
[[limit]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[timely]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and
[**accurate** info]{.mark}]{.underline}rmation [available [to]{.mark}
civilian]{.underline} decision-makers [and military
[commanders]{.mark}]{.underline} [[during crisis]{.mark}
situations.]{.underline} This is [**compounded by** how
[difficult]{.mark} it would be]{.underline} for officials [[to]{.mark}
**quickly [interpret]{.mark}** whether]{.underline} a satellite
[[malfunction]{.mark} was **[cause]{.mark}**d]{.underline}
[**intentional**ly **or**]{.underline} inadvertently [by]{.underline}
humans, [a]{.underline} damaging space phenomenon (such as [**solar
flare**s]{.underline}), or routine mechanical failure.
[Attributing]{.underline} who or what is responsible for such a
disruption in space is usually possible, but
[[requires]{.underline}]{.mark} equipment, [**[analysts]{.underline}**,
[and time]{.underline}]{.mark}---all of which may be [**[in short
supply]{.mark}** during]{.underline} a [crisis.]{.underline}
[This]{.underline} situation could also [**[create]{.mark} a
[first-strike incentive]{.mark}** for U.S. decision-makers]{.underline}
seeking to act before its understanding of a terrestrial dispute or its
space situational awareness---the ability to view, characterize, and
predict the location of manmade objects in space---is interrupted or
further degraded. Preventive Options The United States has several
unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral options for preventing dangerous
space events most detrimental to U.S. interests. In addition to taking
further steps to improve the survivability and redundancy of U.S. space
assets and enhance its ability to detect dangerous space activities and
debris, the United States could undertake other unilateral measures,
such as declaring a moratorium on all ASAT testing to pressure other
states to do the same. The United States could also promote a nontreaty
prohibition of direct ascent ASAT tests. However, given that this would
limit the operational requirements of mid-range U.S. ballistic missile
defenses, such an agreement would be infeasible because of intense
domestic political opposition. Moreover, while an ASAT and direct ascent
ASAT ban would be beneficial to U.S. security, it is unlikely that
China, North Korea, or Iran would agree to, let alone abide by, such
agreements. Additionally, emerging space powers, such as Russia and
India, may prioritize the development of space capabilities in an effort
to match those of other space powers. The United States could issue
clear and specific public warnings to deter malicious activity in space.
As of yet, U.S. deterrent threats are confined to Pentagon planning
documents, or have been applied with little specificity to cyber and
space domains contemporaneously. If the space event was detected during
the planning stage by the U.S. intelligence community, or it became
clear that a country developing space capabilities intended to use them
maliciously and the resultant space debris could be predicted by JSpOC,
the United States could publicize the costs that such debris would pose
to the world\'s satellites in an attempt to marshal international
condemnation to prevent it. Military options to deter impending actions,
or respond if necessary, include deploying naval assets toward a
potential adversary, placing regionally based bombers on high-alert
status, attempting to intercept a space launch with the sea-based Aegis
ballistic missile defense system (a near impossibility for far inland
China launches), or attempting to preemptively strike the space launch
platform with long-range bombers or conventionally armed ballistic
missiles. Though the United States possesses advanced direct ascent ASAT
capabilities, employing them against Chinese, North Korean, or Iranian
space systems would signal that such acts were normal behavior and
create space debris threatening to U.S. space assets. Beyond these
unilateral options, the United States could issue private demarches to
warn and educate China, North Korea, or Iran of the consequences of a
direct ascent or co-orbital ASAT test. The United States could initiate
trust-building measures with specific countries to reduce the risk of
inadvertent conflict. For example, U.S. officials could work with
Chinese military leaders to establish rules of the road for space, such
as announcing space launches and implementing emerging industry
standards for debris mitigation, which could be included as part of the
U.S.-China military discussions on common understandings for
international airspace, the open seas, and cyberspace. Currently, no
legal or nonbinding instruments governing outer space exist other than
the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the
Exploration and Use of Outer Space. U.S. diplomats could also request
greater clarity from North Korea and Iran about the intent of their
space activities. Multilaterally, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to
[develop and [promote **bilat**]{.mark}**eral**]{.underline} and
multilateral **[transparency]{.underline}** and confidence-building
[measures]{.underline} in outer space, expanding on the UN Group of
Governmental Experts\' roadmap published in July 2013. This would
include **[[info]{.underline}]{.mark}**rmation [**[exchange]{.mark}**s
and]{.underline} notifications, consultative mechanisms, **[[shared
s]{.underline}]{.mark}**pace **[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**ituational
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**wareness, and the publication of
**[n]{.underline}**ational **[s]{.underline}**pace
**[p]{.underline}**olicies. Likewise, the United States could seek to
advance discussions in the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer
Space, which is developing best practices for space debris and
collaborative space situational awareness.

[[The]{.mark} U.S.-China [relationship in space]{.mark} [has the
potential to be a]{.mark} stable [foundation for a stronger
**overall**]{.mark} [relationship]{.mark} between the two
countries]{.underline}. [Space was]{.underline} arguably [a
[stabilizing]{.mark} element in the relationship between the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Soviet Union [during the
Cold War]{.mark} [by]{.mark} [providing]{.mark} national capabilities to
reduce tensions and [an outlet for]{.mark}
[collaboration]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although the future of the
U.S.-China relationship will be characterized by both competition and
cooperation, [taking concrete steps to stabilize relations in space can
be part of the solution to avoiding th]{.underline}e "Thucydides [trap,"
where an established power's fear of a rising power leads to
conflict]{.underline}.

The Role of Space in the U.S.-China Relationship

Space is a critical domain to the security of the United States. Space
capabilities enable secure, hardened communications with nuclear forces,
enable the verification and monitoring of arms control treaties, and
provide valuable intelligence. Such capabilities are the foundation of
the United States' ability to defend its borders, project power to
protect its allies and interests overseas, and defeat adversaries. The
space domain, however, is currently experiencing significant changes
that could affect the United States' ability to maintain all these
benefits in the future. A growing number of state and nonstate actors
are involved in space, resulting in more than 1,200 active satellites in
orbit and thousands more planned in the near future. Active satellites
coexist in space along with hundreds of thousands of dead satellites,
spent rocket stages, and other pieces of debris that are a legacy of six
decades of space activities. As a result, the most useful and densely
populated orbits are experiencing significant increases in physical and
electromagnetic congestion and interference.

Amid this change, China is rapidly developing its capabilities across
the entire spectrum of space activities. It has a robust and successful
human spaceflight and exploration program that in many ways mirrors
NASA's successes in the 1960s and 1970s and is a similar source of
national pride. Although it still has a long way to go, China is
developing a range of space capabilities focused on national security
that one day might be second only to those of the United States. [Some
of China's new capabilities have created significant concern within the
U.S. national security community, as they are aimed at countering or
threatening the space capabilities of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and other countries.

The massive changes in the space domain and China's growing capabilities
have affected the U.S.-China relationship in space. [[There is
growing]{.mark} [mistrust]{.mark} between the two countries,
fueled]{.underline} in part [by their development and testing of
dual-use technologies such as rendezvous and proximity operations and
hypervelocity kinetic kill systems]{.underline}. This mistrust is
compounded by a misalignment in political and strategic priorities:
China is focused on developing and increasing its capabilities in the
space domain, whereas the United States is focused on maintaining and
assuring access to its space capabilities.

Recommendations for Managing Tensions and Promoting Positive Engagement

Despite these challenges and concerns, [[there are concrete]{.mark}
[steps]{.mark} that the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
China can take [to]{.mark}]{.underline} manage tensions and possibly
even [[work toward **positive engagement**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
2011, President Barack Obama and then Chinese president Hu Jintao issued
a joint statement on strengthening U.S.-China relations during a visit
by President Hu to the White House. As one of the steps outlined in the
statement, the two presidents agreed to take specific actions to deepen
dialogue and exchanges in the field of space and discuss opportunities
for practical future cooperation.

President Xi Jinping's upcoming visit presents an opportunity to build
on the 2011 agreement and take steps toward these goals. The first step
should be to have a substantive discussion on space security. President
Obama should clearly communicate the importance that the United States
places on assured access to space, U.S. concerns with recent Chinese
counterspace testing, and the potential negative consequences of any
aggressive acts in space. Both countries should exchange views on space
policies, including their interpretations of how self-defense applies to
satellites and hostile actions in space. Doing so can help avoid
misunderstandings and misperceptions that could lead either country to
unwittingly take actions that escalate a crisis.

Second, Presidents Obama and Xi should discuss [[specific]{.mark} ideas
for [cooperation]{.mark} [in]{.mark} civil and [scientific]{.mark}
[space activities]{.mark} [and the use of space]{.mark} for peaceful
[applications]{.mark} [on earth]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[[Continuing to exclude China]{.mark} from civil space cooperation [will
not prevent it from]{.mark} developing its own [capabilities]{.mark};
this approach will [only ensure]{.mark} that [China]{.mark} [cooperates
with other]{.mark} countrie[s]{.mark}]{.underline} in space in a way
that advances its own national interests and goals. [**[Space
weather,]{.mark}** **[scientific research]{.mark}**, **exploration**,
[capacity building for **disaster response**]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
**global [environmental monitoring]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} all
[areas]{.mark} [where the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and China]{.mark} [share]{.mark} joint
[interests]{.mark} [and could collaborate]{.mark}]{.underline} with each
other and other interested countries to help establish broader
relationships outside the military realm.

In addition, the United States should take steps on its own to stabilize
the relationship. First and foremost, it should get serious about making
U.S. space capabilities more resilient. Increasing resilience would
support deterrence by decreasing the benefits an adversary might hope to
achieve and also help ensure that critical capabilities can survive
should deterrence fail. While resilience has been a talking point for
the last few years, the United States has made little progress toward
achieving the goal. Radical change is thus needed in how Washington
develops and organizes national security space capabilities. Moreover,
the United States should embrace commercial services to diversify and
augment governmental capabilities, while encouraging allies to develop
their own space capabilities.

Second, [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[should]{.underline}]{.mark} continue
to [[bolster]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[transparency]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of space
activities]{.underline} [[by increasing]{.underline}]{.mark} the amount
of space situational awareness ([[SSA) data]{.underline}]{.mark}
available to satellite operators and the public. Greater
[[transparency]{.underline} [reinforces]{.underline}]{.mark} ongoing
U.S. and international [initiatives to]{.underline} [promote
[responsible]{.mark} [behavior in space]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} also helps mitigate the possibility for
accidents or naturally caused events to spark or escalate tensions.
Shifting responsibility for space safety to a civil agency that can
share and cooperate more easily with the international community and
working with the international community to develop more publicly
available sources of SSA data outside the U.S. government are two steps
that would enhance trust, improve data reliability, and reinforce norms
of behavior.

The consequences of not addressing the current strategic instability in
space are real. A future conflict in space between the United States and
China would have devastating impacts on everyone who uses and relies on
space. Both the United States and China have acknowledged the dangers of
outright conflict and have pledged their interest in avoiding such an
outcome. Taken together, [the initial steps outlined here could help
stabilize the U.S.-China strategic relationship in space, mitigate the
threat of the worst-case scenario, and work toward a more positive
outcome that benefits all]{.underline}.

In 1859, while observing sunspots, a young astronomer named Richard
Carrington recorded a geomagnetic storm so powerful, the electrical
currents it sent to Earth were enough to keep the newly invented
telegraph operating without a battery. Centuries later, though humans
have sent robots to Mars and even strong-armed a couple engineers into
walking on the moon, [the science of space weather, the changing
environmental conditions in near-Earth space, has largely managed to
elude us]{.underline}. In fact even the term "space weather" is new; it
wasn't used regularly until the 1990s. Now, an international project led
by **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[is hoping to advance the study of
space weather by]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[light-years]{.underline}]{.mark}** in order [[to minimize the
**dangerous impact**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[a storm]{.mark} in space
might [have on]{.mark}]{.underline} us **[fragile
[Earth]{.mark}]{.underline}**lings. If [experts are
correct]{.underline}, there\'s a chance that [a **serious**]{.underline}
[space weather threat will arrive **sooner rather than
later**]{.underline} -- [and the risk to humans is **greater than you
think**]{.underline}. Oddly, the trouble is that we've become too
advanced. [Because humans today are **so dependent** upon modern
electrical technology, a space storm the size of the one Carrington
recorded in 1859 could cause **catastrophic problems** if it occurred
tomorrow]{.underline}. According to a 2008 National Academy of Sciences
Report, from [long-term electrical blackouts to damage to communication
satellites and GPS systems (not to mention billions in financial
losses), the results could be **devastating worldwide**]{.underline}.
Luckily, scientists are hopeful [the]{.underline}
**[KuaFu]{.underline}** [project]{.underline} [will]{.underline}
**[prevent]{.underline}** ([or **at least minimize**]{.underline} [the
impact of]{.underline}) [this kind of **disaster**]{.underline}. Our
Eyes on the Sun, The Sun in Our Eyes Named for Kua Fu, a sun-chasing
giant from a Chinese folktale whose pursuit to tame the brightest star
in our solar system ended after he died of thirst, the
[**[KuaFu]{.mark}** project [will create a]{.mark} space weather
forecasting [system]{.mark} 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth\'s
surface]{.underline}. The goal is similar to the one from the legend:
[[to observe]{.underline}]{.mark} changes in solar-terrestrial
**[[storms]{.underline}]{.mark}**, investigate flows of energy and solar
material, [[and improve]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[forecasting of
space weather]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Not necessarily to tame the sun,
but, at least, to understand it. Proposed in 2003 by scientist Chuanyi
Tu from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the project will place three
separate satellites at strategic points in our solar system to observe
the inner workings of space weather. China\'s National Space
Administration along with the European and Canadian Space Agencies will
work together to man them. "[Being **aware** of the impending blindness
to space weather and its effects, we consider a mission like **KuaFu
absolutely mandatory**]{.underline}," said Dr. Rainer Schwenn, one of
the developers of KuaFu. "If \'space weather\' keeps being considered an
important science goal, then **[[KuaFu is a real key

tumultuous relationship between the **[sun]{.underline}** and Earth, [by
allowing scientists to observe both the star and its effects on the
planet simultaneously]{.underline}. To now, this process has been
viewable only via computer simulation. "You have to look at the two
systems simultaneously \[to most accurately forecast space weather\]"
said Dr. William Liu, a senior scientist at the Canadian Space Agency
who took over as project leader when Chuanyi Tu retired two years ago.

the United States. "**[That\'s how you prevent
catastrophe]{.underline}**," Liu explained. "You reduce the load on the
parts that are more sensitive." While the project was originally
scheduled to be completed this year, Liu's current estimates put its
debut at 2016. Despite the delays, he remains optimistic it will come to
fruition, pointing out that international collaborations like this one
often stir up scientific and financial challenges that delay the launch
process. Whether the KuaFu project will be able to predict space weather
accurately all of the time is up for debate. Liu, however, is confident
that, at the very least, it\'s a step toward that direction . "With this
launch and operation, we\'ll make our predictions better. Whether it
will be 100 percent, that will be too much to ask, but it will
definitely improve our knowledge."

#### It's [expensive]{.underline}.

Building and Launching a Satellite",

[Sat]{.underline}ellite[s]{.underline} are [**not** **cheap**
business]{.underline}. [They cost a lot of money to design]{.underline},
[construct]{.underline}, [launch]{.underline} [and monitor]{.underline}.
Just how much money? If you have at least \$290 million in your bank
account, that money can go into making a satellite that can track and
monitor hurricanes. Add about \$100 million dollars more if you want a
satellite that carries a missile-warning device.

What makes satellites so expensive?

Some of the [factors that drive the cost of sat]{.underline}ellite[s are
the **equipment** and **materials** used to **build them**]{.underline}.
[Transponders alone hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to
maintain]{.underline}, [while bandwidth cost per MHz is priced at a
minimum of about \$3,500 a month]{.underline}. Running a satellite at a
36MHz bandwidth will cost over **[\$1.5 million a year]{.underline}**.
There are also the other gadgets and equipment that have to be built
into the satellite in order for it to perform its intended function.
These can include computers, computer software and cameras.

Another factor that contributes to the expense associated with
satellites is the cost of putting one into orbit. It is estimated that a
[single satellite launch can range in cost from]{.underline} a low of
about \$50 million to a high of about **[\$400 million]{.underline}**.
[Launching a space shuttle mission can easily cost **\$500
million**]{.underline} dollars, although one mission is capable of
carrying multiple satellites and send them into orbit.

Also [to be considered in the cost]{.underline} of satellites [is its
**maintenance**]{.underline}. [After getting one into
orbit]{.underline}, it [has to be **monitored** from a ground facility,
which]{.underline} will [require]{.underline} ~~manpower~~
\[**[peoplepower]{.underline}**\]. Satellites are also not impervious to
damage or down times. Furthermore, [if things don't go too well during a
launch]{.underline}, a [**multi-million endeavor** can]{.underline}
either end up in pieces or [sustain damages that will cost **more
money** to repair]{.underline}.

#### Consumes [massive]{.underline} resources.

[Launching]{.underline} [military assets into space]{.underline} -- a
"core element of national security" -- [is becoming **too
expensive**]{.underline} and bureaucratic and could render the
Pentagon's space program "ineffective," warns the director of the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

\"I think we\'re in the middle of a self-inflicted surprise in some
senses in space today, it's a very different kind of surprise but it's
one that is rendering us ineffective and putting us in a place where we
simply cannot afford to be,\" DARPA Director Arati Prabhakar said Monday
at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics SciTech 2014
conference.

[Per-launch costs have soared into the **tens of millions** of
dollars]{.underline}, [and take **years** to **plan** and
**execute**]{.underline}. The [biggest barriers to cost-effective
military spaceflight]{.underline}: [a **shortage** of **launch
locations**]{.underline}, [and an inability to use **existing
infra**]{.underline}structure [and **takeoff points**]{.underline}.

\"There\'s also something going on inside the national security
community in space that\'s actually quite troubling," Prabhakar said.
"That has to do with how slow and costly it is for us today to do
anything we need to do on orbit for national security purposes.

Prabhakar said the agency is investing in programs like the Airborne
Launch Assist Space Access program, which could bring the price of
taking cargo into outer space down from \$30,000 a pound to \$10,000.
The agency is working with scientists and engineers to make the
construction and maintenance of satellites more cost-effective.

"[As we develop those capabilities]{.underline} at \[geosynchronous
orbit\], we believe we're [going to start **changing** the fundamental
dynamics]{.underline}, [and the **economics**]{.underline},
[of]{.underline} [what's]{.underline} going to be [possible with
**satellite capability**]{.underline}," Prabhakar said.

Geospatial-Intelligence Agency

GEOINT 2022: [NATO is mulling a new]{.underline}, and somewhat
surprising, [effort to directly **buy imagery** from commercial
providers in a move that]{.underline} industry sources say appears to
have [irked the **US spy satellite agencies** that have
**traditionally** filled that **role**]{.underline}. Interested
companies have until the close of business today to respond to NATO's
request for information (RFI).

[Alliance member nations]{.underline}, too, [have been asked to
identify]{.underline} "**[emerging]{.underline}** and/or existing"
[**remote sensing capabilities** that could help **NATO's military
command**]{.underline} produce "imagery intelligence," or IMINT. IMINT
is provided primarily by satellites, as well as by aerial photography.

The [US is the largest operator of **military**]{.underline}
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (**[ISR]{.underline}**)
[satellites]{.underline}, [and is **outwardly supportive** of the
effort]{.underline}, which an IC official said could improve NATO's
production of geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) products.

"We want NATO to produce timely, relevant, and trusted GEOINT that can
be easily shared with the Alliance, and we work with NATO towards that
end," Melissa Planert, deputy director for international affairs at the
[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]{.underline}
(**[NGA]{.underline}**), said in an email.

"NGA's position is that we also strongly recommend NATO seek diverse
imagery sources, products and services from across the Alliance and from
commercial vendors," she added. "A diverse selection of imagery and
analysis providers will only benefit GEOINT contributions to NATO
intelligence requirements, and strengthen NATO policymakers'
understanding of the complex security situation."

NGA is responsible --- in its role as GEOINT functional manager and a
combat-support agency for the Defense Department --- for providing
imagery and ISR analytics to military commanders, including at NATO. NGA
collects satellite imagery from the National Reconnaissance Office and
US and selected foreign commercial providers.

In fact, one NGA official told Breaking Defense that the NATO RFI was
spurred by concerns from allied military officials that budget cuts to
the agency might affect their ability to receive timely US imagery and
support.

But despite Planert's assurances, industry sources said they've felt
[the US Intelligence Community is much **less receptive** to the idea of
NATO using its **collective budget** to acquire]{.underline} commercial
imagery and **[analytical services]{.underline}**.

One [industry official said that for **NGA**]{.underline} and NRO,
"[it's **all about control**]{.underline}" [of the
information]{.underline}.

Exploratory First Step

The RFI was issued last month \[PDF\] by Headquarters Supreme Allied
Commander Transformation (HQ SACT), based in Norfolk, Va. SACT is one of
only two NATO strategic commands, and is responsible for research,
development and acquisition of new technology. French Gen. Philippe
Lavigne was appointed as commander this past September.

A SACT spokesperson told Breaking Defense in an email that the RFI
doesn't represent a formal bidding process, rather is a first
information-gathering step.

"The purpose of this RFI is to involve industry/academia and Nations,
through collaboration, in an examination of current and future
capabilities. This is the exploratory phase of the process and does not
represent a commitment to acquire any such services," the spokesperson
wrote. "NATO looks forward to working with industry/academia and Nations
to ascertain if they possess prospective products, systems or
sub-systems that will then help inform NATO's capability development
decision-making process."

It is unclear that if a decision is made to institute a formal
procurement whether it would be the first time NATO has sought to
collectively purchase its own IMINT.

The SACT spokesperson said that the NATO commands have worked with
commercial imagery providers in the past during exercises. Further,
Allied Command Transformation (ACT) "regularly works with nations and
industry to identify prospective products that would support capability
development in various fields." However, the spokesperson was unable to
confirm by press time whether there had ever been a formal acquisition
program.

NATO only in 2019 declared space a legitimate operational domain, and in
January this year finally released a first-ever alliance space policy.
That policy calls on allies to voluntarily ensure compatibility among
their national space assets, while pledging members to develop
collective requirements and the means of fulfilling them --- including
the use of commercial capabilities.

Alliance commanders do have access to remote sensing imagery provided by
member states. However, besides the US, only a handful of the 29 allied
nations operate remote sensing satellites, military or commercial.
According to a study \[PDF\] by CNA's China Aerospace Studies Institute,
US allies own or operate only a total of 69 remote sensing sats. Germany
operates the most, with 16 birds. By contrast, US national security and
commercial operators have more than 500.

Thus, the US is the primary provider of space-based ISR to NATO ---
although there have historically been problems with sharing images and
analysis based on data from uber-classified spy-sats. This is one reason
why there has been a public push by top military commanders to
declassify space capabilities.

Indeed, in the run up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it took a
decision by President Joe Biden himself to release imagery of the
conflict from US spy satellites, Ronald Moultrie, DoD undersecretary for
intelligence and security, told the USGIF GEOINT 2022 symposium near
Denver this week. This includes pushing US commercial firms to provide
Ukraine's government, and release to the global public, their own
imagery of Russian military actions, which have reportedly included
human rights violations.

"That decision was not taken lightly," he said. Rather, it was a "gutsy
decision to say: 'We are going to disclose some of the most insensitive,
sensitive intelligence that we have, but it's important enough for us to
do.\'"

Mixed Messages From The IC?

A number of industry sources told Breaking Defense in the run up to and
during the GEOINT conference that [IC officials were resistant to the
concept of NATO using]{.underline} its collective [funds to
buy]{.underline} commercial [imagery]{.underline}, [rather
than]{.underline} simply [**rely** upon that provided by
**NGA**/**NRO**]{.underline} and other NATO members. These sources said
that IC officials were instead pushing NATO not to move ahead with a
formal acquisition.

"[**NRO** wants **everything** to **go through them**]{.underline}," one
company rep said bluntly.
