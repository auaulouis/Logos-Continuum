[Who Insists Russia Is in **Decline**]{.underline} and Why?

So where is this contention coming from and why does it persist? Part of
the explanation is that many **[western pundits]{.underline}** --
[and]{.underline} even government [advisors -- are ill-informed about
Russia]{.underline}. But that doesn't seem to explain the phenomenon
entirely.

[Western leaders]{.underline} -- particularly those in the United States
-- loved Yeltsin who presided over an undemocratic Russia on the verge
of collapse, a sizable portion of its population in desperate straits.
They've [heaped nothing but scorn on Putin, who]{.underline} -- whether
one likes him or not -- demonstrably [stabilized the country
on]{.underline} many fronts, including [the **economy**, **mortality
rate**, **crime**, and the **legal system**]{.underline}.

When [Putin]{.underline} is not being pressured by the US-led West, he
[is a typical Eastern **European liberal**]{.underline}. Putin's actions
and policies during his first two terms as president bear this out.

### 2AC -- Not Declining

#### Russia isn't declining [BUT]{.underline} won't be a threat regardless.

Analyses and a fellow at the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute,

Strategy,\"

[Russia is not **a rising power**, but it will not decline as a
threat]{.underline} to the United States [in any appreciable
way]{.underline} in the near- or medium-term. Moreover, the declining
power mantra is puzzling as a basis for defense prioritization since
declining powers can be more dangerous than rising ones. The United
States must not let its desire to focus efforts on China result in
strategic malpractice by failing to account for a world with multiple
competitors, including one in which Moscow and Beijing may collaborate
to the detriment of U.S. efforts. Consequently, the United States needs
to take Russia seriously. [Moscow is an **enduring great
power**]{.underline} and should continue to be a major factor in U.S.
strategy.

[Russia retains the power to challenge]{.underline} or violently upend
[the **security architecture** of Europe]{.underline}. In military
terms, it [has the conventional **military power** to deter the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, take on any coalition
of lesser states, [and use force]{.underline} successfully outside of
its region to deny U.S. foreign policy prerogatives elsewhere (as Syria
aptly illustrates). As a nuclear power, [Russia is in a league only with
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, with a much larger
non-strategic nuclear arsenal to boot. Together the United States and
Russia account for over 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons.
[Moscow]{.underline} also [has a seat at]{.underline} the table in [the
world's most **significant international institutions** like the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[N]{.underline}**ations
**[S]{.underline}**ecurity **[C]{.underline}**ouncil. A conflict between
the United States and Russia --- or between Russia and an American ally
--- could have existential implications for the prevailing international
order.

Instead of comparing Russia to the United States or China, the [question
is whether Russian power **relative** to that of U.S. allies is
declining]{.underline} by any appreciable measure. Perhaps the strangest
and most factually inaccurate strain in national security discourse on
Russia is the notion that there is something deterministic about
Russia's demographic outlook, and its implications for state power.
While [Russia]{.underline}'s population is set to decline by
approximately 7 percent (to 135 million) by 2050, it [will remain the
**most populous** country in Europe by a **wide margin**]{.underline}.
Russia's demographic decline is not just overstated, based on dated
estimates, but it is unlikely to substantially constrain Russian power
in any meaningful way. The demographic outlook for many of America's
allies, as well as China, is just as worrisome. The relevance of
demographics to state power today is not a simple question: what matters
is quality of human capital rather than quantity. Often it seems that
Washington's understanding of how to assess power, and what matters, is
more suitable for the world of 1920, as opposed to 2020. In any case,
Russia is not going to run out of people.

[Russia's]{.underline} economy may appear one dimensional --- depending
heavily on resource extraction --- but [**economic power** speaks to
potential]{.underline}, and even then crudely. In truth, the economic
foundations of Russian power have often been weak compared to Moscow's
status ambitions. That said, Russia is not a one dimensional power.
[Simple **GDP measures**]{.underline}, based on market exchange rates,
[disguise the fact that Russia is one of the world's largest economies
with **tremendous resources**.]{.underline} For example, while many
think tanks assess Russian defense spending at a mere \$60 billion, a
much more accurate way of comparing defense spending, which adjusts for
purchasing power parity or PPP, illustrates that Russian military
expenditure is in the range of \$150-180 billion per year.

The mismatch between Russian economic strength and apparent performance
has engendered a mistaken perception that Russia is just playing a weak
hand well, perhaps due to President Vladimir Putin's assertiveness.
Individual leaders and their ideas matter, but the conventional wisdom
has it backwards. [Russia is much **stronger**, and more **resilient**
as a power than it's typically given credit]{.underline}, while its
leadership is hardly a fountain of strategic aptitude. There is also
little evidence that the significant disagreements over interests,
values, and outlooks on how to order the world will disappear with a
different Russian leader, or that a different regime in [Moscow will
embrace America's view of the world]{.underline}. What the [narrative on
**Russian decline** gets wrong is Russia's **historic ability** to
resurrect itself after a period of]{.underline} stagnation,
[decline]{.underline}, or state collapse to rebuild state power and
influence. U.S. defense thinking has fallen victim to the fallacy of
secular trends: the belief that a rising China will stay rising and a
stagnating Russia will continue to do so. Ironically, there is good
evidence that China has tremendous structural weaknesses, which are
commonly brushed aside, but in Russia's case the same problems are
viewed as somehow deterministic.

#### Russia is [unambiguously stable]{.underline}.

College, 12/26/2021, \"Reports of Russia's decline are greatly
exaggerated,\"

[Tales of Russia's demise have **circulated**]{.underline} with
remarkable consistency since the fall of the Soviet Union on Dec. 25
exactly three decades ago. Having fallen from its superpower pedestal,
the [Soviet Union's successor state was routinely characterized as a
"**declining power**]{.underline}," a "has-been power" and a "downshift
power."

In recent years, the more [**dire prophesies** of Russian
collapse]{.underline} that circulated in the 1990s [hav]{.underline}ing
[gone unfulfilled]{.underline}, such characterizations have given way to
a recognition that [Russia is]{.underline} in fact [a "**persistent
power**]{.underline}." Fundamentally, though, nothing has changed.
Whether rebranded as a mere "nuisance power" or as a perpetually
"disruptive" power, Russia is viewed now as it has been since it emerged
out of the wreckage of the Soviet Union in December 1991 --- as a
broken, if sometimes petulant, vestige of a once-mighty superpower.

But as the crisis in Ukraine has once again demonstrated, such
characterizations are grossly misleading. Indeed, they couldn't be more
wrong. Russi[a is not the **geopolitical basket-case** it was in
the]{.underline} immediate [post-Soviet era.]{.underline} Nor is it the
bit player on the world stage it is often portrayed as in the Western
press. In fact, quite the opposite: Viewed dispassionately and in the
cold light of Realpolitik, [Russia is **unambiguously** a "great power"
--- a country possessing both **substantial instruments** of national
power]{.underline} and the will to use these instruments to influence
political outcomes around the world. And any American grand strategy
worthy of the name will have to take that undeniable fact into account.

When it comes to possessing a substantial and varied instrument of
power, there can be little doubt that Russia meets the "great power"
standard. To be sure, economic woes and demographic challenges continue
to plague the country. But the myth of [Russian decline is]{.underline}
precisely that --- [a **myth.**]{.underline}

The Russian military today is not the poorly trained and ill-equipped
conscript rabble that fared so poorly in Chechnya in the mid-1990s.
Spurred in large part by that experience, [Moscow undertook a **radical
modernization**]{.underline} and upgrading [of the country's
**nuclear**]{.underline} and conventional **[forces]{.underline}**, with
staggeringly impressive results. While some [**asymmetries**
remain]{.underline} between Russia on the one hand and the United States
and China on the other, resurrected Russia's "hard power" capabilities
now place it in the same league as those two recognized great powers ---
and in a different league altogether than almost every other country on
the planet.

Similarly, there can be little doubt that [Moscow is able to
field]{.underline} the "**[soft]{.underline}**" and "sharp"
**[power]{.underline}** capabilities of a great power. Regarding the
former -- which in Russia's case refers to the country's ability [to
"wage friendship]{.underline}" -- Russia has developed a formidable
arsenal of tools for generating good will and attracting political
support. These include Russian media (including the RT and Sputnik
networks), Russian cultural centers, the Russian Orthodox Church and
Russian universities and research centers. [Moscow also exercises soft
power through the provision of **humanitarian aid** and **debt
relief**]{.underline} and security through Russian-centered
international organizations such as the Collective Security Treaty
Organization.

### 1AR -- No Decline -- Economics

#### [ECONOMICS]{.underline}. GDP doesn't assume [purchasing parity]{.underline}.

Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American
Security; Michael Kofman, Director of the Russia Studies Program at CNA

sg

The problem is that the case for [Russian decline is **overstated**.
Much of the evidence]{.underline} for it, such as Russia's shrinking
population and its resource-dependent economy, is not as consequential
for the Kremlin as many in Washington assume. [Nor should the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates expect [that Russia
will **automatically** abandon its course]{.underline} of confrontation
once President Vladimir Putin leaves office. [Putin's foreign policy
enjoys **widespread support**]{.underline} among the country's ruling
elite, and his legacy will include a thicket of unresolved disputes,
chief among them that over the annexation of Crimea. Any disagreements
with the United States are here to stay.

Put simply, Washington cannot afford to fixate on China while hoping to
simply wait Russia out. Rather than viewing Russia as a declining power,
[U.S. leaders should see it as a **persistent one**]{.underline}---and
have a frank conversation about the country's true capabilities and
vulnerabilities. Rethinking American assumptions about Russian power
would allow policymakers to address what will be a period of prolonged
confrontation with a capable adversary.

FAULTY ASSUMPTIONS

Expectations of Russian decline contain important truths. The country's
economy is stagnant, with few sources of value other than the extraction
and export of natural resources. The entire system is rife with
corruption and dominated by inefficient state-owned or state-controlled
enterprises, and international sanctions limit access to capital and
technology. Russia struggles to develop, retain, and attract talent; the
state chronically underfunds scientific research; and bureaucratic
mismanagement hinders technological innovation. As a result, Russia lags
considerably behind the United States and China in most metrics of
scientific and technological development. Military spending has largely
plateaued in the last four years, and the population is forecast to
decline by ten million people by 2050.

With such a dismal outlook, it is natural to assume that Russia's
capacity for disruption and hostility on the international stage will
soon diminish, too---that the Kremlin will simply run out of resources
for its aggressive foreign policy. But those data points miss the
broader picture. They highlight Russia's weaknesses and downplay its
strengths. Russia may be "a downshifter country," as Herman Gref, the
head of Russia's largest bank, complained in 2016. But its economic,
demographic, and military potential will remain substantial, rather than
entering a precipitous decline.

Consider the [country's economy, which, stagnant as it may be, is still
**larger** and more **resilient** than many believe]{.underline}.
Analysts like to point out that [Russia's **GDP**]{.underline} of \$1.5
trillion is comparable to that of Italy or Texas. But that [\$1.5
trillion is calculated using market **exchange rates**]{.underline}.
[Factor in purchasing **power parity**, and it **balloons** to \$4.1
trillion]{.underline}, which would make Russia the second-largest
economy in Europe and the sixth-largest in the world. Neither measure is
wholly accurate---one is likely an underestimate, the other an
overestimate---but the comparison shows that [Russia's economy is
nowhere near as small as the **conventional wisdom** holds]{.underline}.
At any rate, [raw GDP is often a **poor measure** of geopolitical
power]{.underline}: it no longer translates easily into military
potential or international influence.
