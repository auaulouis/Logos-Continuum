# K---Racial IR---FMPS

This is similar to the imperialism K put out by the BFHR lab, but
focuses more on the racialized epistemologies and motivations behind IR
scholarship than on the external imperial outcomes of policy, and has a
much more framework/scholarship-focused alternative. That said, the
evidence between the two Ks very much overlaps, so you can use that file
to supplement this one and vice versa.

#### IR scholarship is founded on [racial omission]{.underline}.

Beyond the "Norm Against Noticing"", CS)

[The field of IR is grappling with renewed calls to reform its
longstanding elision of race,]{.underline} manifested most recently in
Foreign Policy(Bhambra et al. 2020, Shilliam 2020a, Zvobgo & Loken2020)
and Foreign Affairs(Blain 2020). These interventions have since been
complemented by various public speaker series, webinars, and discussion
forums, each retrieving important contributions that criticize IR
scholarship as silent on race[. Those that expose and contest this
silence aptly describe it as particularly tenacious in mainstream IR,
especially research that appears in the discipline's top
journals]{.underline}. While new efforts are being made to take race
seriously, such as Búzás's(2021) piece in the 75th anniversary special
issue of International Organization and the special issue calls on race
by Security Studies and Security Dialogue, [IR scholars are still coming
to terms with a discipline that is historically reluctant to address
questions of race. The notion that IR is colorblind has long been
interrogated. Seminal critiques of this notion,]{.underline} of which
the norm against noticing is a contemporary interpretation[, lay bare
the centrality of race and racism in the making of an intellectual and
professional discipline]{.underline}. [The mythology of a colorblind
tradition in American IR was rendered explicit by early disciplinary
work on the role of White supremacy in world making]{.underline}. To the
forebears of this critique, [what was often taken to be race neutral
was, in practice, silence and evasion about the African presence in
world politics]{.underline}. As Krishna (2001) explains, [race
constitutes a crucial epistemic silence around which modern IR is
continuously made and coheres.]{.underline} For Krishna, [contemporary
IR discourse is predicated on a systematic politics of forgetting, an
abstraction from the role of racialized violence in the construction of
nation-states and the system they inhabit]{.underline}. As the
discipline developed, [the timeless problems of anarchy and the security
dilemma came to define the core questions of IR in line with Cold War
imperatives, making race irrelevant for many scholars. Relations between
states,]{.underline} where material power and national interest shape
behavior, [were assumed to occur above the supposedly domestic issue of
race.]{.underline} [Intellectual commitment to the assumption of anarchy
in world politics,]{.underline} however, [was coterminous with the
discipline's willful amnesia about race.]{.underline} Indeed, [while
implicitly equating anarchy with the primitive, and equating the
resulting state of nature with supposedly violent peoples outside
Europe, scholars stripped anarchy of any notion of race and
racism]{.underline} (Sampson 2002). For some, the norm against noticing
reflects a common difficulty in accepting the idea that [the
"international" in international relations was imagined along the color
line]{.underline} (Vitalis 2015).[For critical theorists, forgetting
race cannot be reduced to discomfort, disinterest, or unaware-ness among
scholars]{.underline} (Sabaratnam 2020). [By implication, the
invisibility of race in IR was not accidental but designed. Similar
observations have been made about the makeup of the IR as mostly White
and male, an institutionalized feature that produces and reproduces
itself]{.underline} (Doty1993; Henderson 2007, 2013; Lake 2016;
Rutazibwa 2020). [That which was made most visible in IR---its
distinguishing intuitions and methodologies---is also that which
conceals race, denying the possibility of its explanatory
power.]{.underline}

#### Mobilizing NATO to save the planet is a racialized project that gets operationalized to inflict [violence]{.underline} on the Other.

**Platon 15**(Mircea Alexandru, Doctor of Philosophy, Ohio State
University, History ""PROTRACTED CONFLICT" The Foreign Policy Research
Institute "Defense Intellectuals" and Their Cold War Struggle with Race
and Human Rights", CS) Marked for ableist language

The FPRI literature produced by Possony, Strausz-Hupé, Kintner, and
their constant collaborators argued that [the only way to defend White
Western Civilization against Communist "Oriental despotism" was the
development out of a military confederation such as NATO of an Atlantic
Union---]{.underline} a political confederation under American hegemony,
and, as Possony argued as early as 1949, [the creation of a world
police]{.underline} (Possony 1949 , 1953 ). [This]{.underline}
institutional [structure would allow "Western democracies" a virtual
monopoly on technology, natural resources, and violence.]{.underline} As
a Cold Warrior impatient with the "verbal magic" of the empty legal
formulas of international organizations and agreements, Possony
maintained that [there was no other way to maintain peace than war and
the increase of the capacity to wage war, defined as "the purge of the
enemies of the new order]{.underline}" (1949, pp. 294-295). For
Strausz-Hupé, [the United States was "the most powerful nation of
European stock"]{.underline} (1945, p. 108), a fact of enormous
importance according to the theories of Third Reich geopolitician
Michael Hess, quoted by Strausz-Hupé. Hess argued that [only the "white
race"---through its mastery of technology---was "truly
'space-bridging,'" the other races being of the space-bound
variety]{.underline} (Strausz-Hupé 1942 , p. 91). That meant [that both
the geographical position and its technological prowess designated the
United States as the main "arsenal" of an "international police force,"
and as the master of the "nucleus" of great powers that would control
the balance and the stability of the "new and universal order" after the
defeat of the Axis powers]{.underline} (Strausz-Hupé 1942 , p. 194-195).
Quoting Karl Haushofer's judgment that the United States "possessed all
the geopolitical prerequisites" for achieving global hegemony,
Strausz-Hupé warned that Haushofer had hoped that the Americans would
eventually fail in their bid for world supremacy because they were
"race-biologically ~~retarded"~~ and torn apart by internal racial
tensions (Strausz-Hupé 1942 , pp. 66-67). The keen interest manifested
by Strausz-Hupé, Possony, and Kintner for the role played by "race"
during the Cold War seems to betray their fear that Haushofer was right
and that lack of racial homogeneity would indeed compromise the U.S. bid
for global leadership (Glaser and Possony, 1979 ). It is indeed
difficult to understand Strausz-Hupé's work without taking into
consideration the way in which Nazi geopolitical theories informed his
racialized approach to the Cold War (Crampton and Tuathaila, 1996 ;
Raffestin et al., 1995 ). Nazi Geopolitik---with [its concept of a
dynamic frontier and perpetual international instability fostered by the
dynamic of growing, expanding versus shrinking, and dying, states---was
interpreted]{.underline} by Strausz-Hupé in terms of [an opposition
between the stable, "civilized order" of Europe and "the Asiatic
aversion to fixed boundaries"]{.underline} (Strausz-Hupé 1942 , p. 220).
Europeans, Strausz-Hupé argued, could not be reasonably expected to
forget the "pungent meaning of Asia" (1942, p. 91).
[Strausz-Hupé]{.underline} discovered some sense even in Hitler's
frenzied attacks on "Asiatic bolshevism" and [warned that, since the
history of Russia bore the mark of the Mongols and since Russia had
inherited the role of Asian oppressor of Europe, the Cold War was merely
another stage of the eternal clash]{.underline} of "men of the steppe
against the man of the sown; the mounted horde against the dwellers of
the city; mass against form" (1952, p. 82). [These premises allowed FPRI
intellectuals to defend both the legacy of old-fashioned European
colonialism and new-fangled American imperialism by denouncing any
anti-colonial movement or non-aligned state as an "Asiatic," unruly,
"primitive" threat against the "real," civilized, democratic "New Order"
dominated by the United States]{.underline} (Strausz-Hupé 1942 , p.
196). The United States led the Free World in a global struggle for the
"preservation of the [Western Communit]{.underline}y" (Strausz-Hupé 1952
, p. 3). Since this struggle was a psychomachia, a clashing of spiritual
worlds, StrauszHupé [rejected any "optimistic idea" about a meeting of
the cultures and argued that only a "whole," "unitary," and pure Western
culture could hope to successfully meet the challenge of the
East]{.underline}. According to Strausz-Hupé, one of the ways in which
the West could transform the "discrete whole" of European culture into a
world culture was to abandon the antiquated and ultimately petty cult of
national heroes and promote instead the "heroes of its common
undertakings[," the conquerors and colonizers who were the true global
heralds of the West]{.underline}: "The exploits of Cortes, Pizzaro,
Clive, Stanley, Bugeaud, Lyautey, Rhodes, Muraviev were conquests on an
Asiatic scale" (1952, pp. 7-8, 12-13). Western colonial expansion
indicated a thriving Western culture [(]{.underline}although the West
was supposed to be at the same time essentially static, a victim of
Asiatic restlessness). In order [to defend this way of life, America had
to]{.underline} vigorously [embrace military, economic, and cultural
imperialism, a]{.underline} benign form of imperialism [whose weapons
were]{.underline} not merely "military force or political coercion," but
also ["anti-imperialist" discourses]{.underline} (Strausz-Hupé 1952 , p.
294[). It also had to create an Atlantic Union]{.underline} and increase
spending on propaganda in order to advance the vertical and horizontal
integration of Western culture, that is [to discourage the
multiplication of people with lower IQ levels and to encourage the
adoption of the same Weberian pro-capitalist]{.underline} Protestant
[values by the entire "Free World." The creation of an Atlantic Union
would be both the result and the safeguard of these
efforts.]{.underline}

#### The impact is a [self-fulfilling prophecy]{.underline}\-\--actors perceive other nations as [more threatening]{.underline}, fueling escalatory actions.

**Búzás 12**(Zoltán I, Associate Professor at the Keough School of
Global Affairs at the University of Notre Dame, "Race and International
Politics: How Racial Prejudice Can Shape Discord and Cooperation among
Great Powers", CS)

[Identity]{.underline} influences foreign policy behavior in several
ways. It may serve as an ideological device to justify self-interested
policies, it may influence the cost of policy options, it may restrict
the menu of possible foreign policies, or it may provide foreign policy
preferences.244 My approach is closest to the latter two. [Identities
influence action by narrowing the]{.underline} menu of [foreign policy
options and by giving actors "primary reasons for action" or providing
them with "motivational and behavioral dispositions.]{.underline}"245 [I
link racial identities to behavior through]{.underline} a relaxed
version of [the "logic of habit."]{.underline} 246 Once activated,
[racial prejudices embedded in racial identities shape threat
perceptions and create behavioral dispositions habitually and relatively
automatically]{.underline}. All else equal, [racial identity shapes
patterns of discord and cooperation]{.underline} as follows. [Through
the lens of their racial identity agents perceive racial others as more
threatening, which facilitates discord and impedes
cooperation]{.underline}. In turn, [agents perceive those with shared
racial identity as less threatening]{.underline}, which facilitates
cooperation and impedes discord. In this view, ["structures of identity
that yield systematically biased perceptions" sustain enduring patterns
of conflict and cooperation]{.underline}.247 [The endurance of these
behavioral patterns is supported by the self-fulfilling nature of
prejudices]{.underline}. [The perceiver acts unconsciously on
prejudices, which elicits prejudice-consistent behavior from target
agents]{.underline}, [validating prejudices and reinforcing their
impact]{.underline} on the behavior of the prejudiced agent.248 Although
a [relaxed logic of habit does not obviate the role of agency,
rationality, and uncertainty, it reduces their
significance]{.underline}. Agents may refuse to act on a particular
prejudice if they recognize it as such, but since [most of the time
prejudices work unconsciously or are not recognized as prejudices,
agents tend to act on them]{.underline}. States may still rationally
calculate what their best options are. However, [their agency will be
constrained and rationality "bounded" as states will consider and act on
a menu of foreign policy options limited by racial
prejudices]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} relaxed [logic]{.underline}
of habit [does not exclude]{.underline} the logic of consequences where
actors are driven by [cost-benefit calculations]{.underline}, but it
[sets the parameters within which this latter can operate]{.underline}.
Uncertainty plays a role in initial stages of threat assessment, but
[once racial prejudices are activated, they dissipate uncertainty by
imposing a false certainty on threats]{.underline}. The process through
which difference in racial identity predisposes agents towards discord
is similar to that through which ["misplaced certainty" facilitates
conflict]{.underline}.249 [In the absence of significant threats
decision makers may nonetheless be certain that they perceive threats.
This can give rise to a series of escalatory actions and reactions which
can facilitate conflict.]{.underline}

#### The [alternative]{.underline} is an [epistemic rejection]{.underline}\-\--refusing the attempt to [racialize]{.underline} the international should start [right here]{.underline}.

**Gani and Marshal** **22**(Jasmine, PhD in International Relations from
the London School of Economics, Jenna, PhD Political Science, Queen Mary
University of London, "The impact of colonialism on policy and knowledge
production in International Relations", CS)

Given the historical and ongoing mutual complicity between knowledge
producers and policy-makers in upholding imperial and racial orders, we
[now consider the responsibilities, possibilities and challenges faced
in altering the nature of that nexus]{.underline}. [Doing so
requires]{.underline} turning to what Danso and Aning call [an 'episteme
of alternativity']{.underline};41 and [the primary way for academics to
enact this would be to draw on anti-colonial practice and legacies,
rather than imperial competition, as the foundation of their
theorizing]{.underline}. Thus, in his article, Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh
forefronts global South policy-makers and focuses on the nuclear order
(a topic that is typically associated with realist IR) to demonstrate
how [it can be approached through an alternative, critical
epistemology]{.underline}.42 [Disrupting the 'Great Power
gaze']{.underline}, Mpofu-Walsh asks what the politics of
non-proliferation looks like from the perspective of the global South,
especially the African continent as the sole nuclear weapon-free zone
(NWFZ). There, denuclearization is fundamentally linked to
decolonization. [Thus anti-colonial goals, rather than
hegemonic/imperialist competition, are at the root of both policy and
theorizing]{.underline}. How different would IR knowledge and theories
on nuclear weapons be if African praxis and the importance of NWFZs were
taken seriously? Turning to the Middle East, Gani similarly argues in
her article that [the inclusion of non-western history and voices---from
policy-makers to activists and scholars---in think-tank discussions can
mitigate the latent colonialism that shapes western
policy]{.underline}.43 Nevertheless, even with an incorporation of
non-western practice and knowledge in policy making and scholarly
theorizing, [multiple perspectives that are marginalized even in the
local context, owing to class or gender, may continue challenge such
patterns is by adopting a more expansive reading of what constitutes
'knowledge' and indeed 'practice'.]{.underline} In doing so, [we can
dismantle some of the constructed and false hierarchies between elite
'knowledge' and 'research']{.underline} on one hand, and local
'tradition' on the other.45 The former is assumed to be objective,
reliable and associated with western (and western-validated)
universities; while the latter is viewed as subjective, unscientific and
commonly associated with Indigenous, racialized, grassroots
communities[. Assumptions about who counts as a true knowledge producer
or 'expert' is not only elitist but heavily racialized and
gendered.]{.underline} Definitions of who counts as a 'practitioner' are
equally narrow, so that [scholars or policy-makers may place much weight
on the views and actions of state, global governance and corporate
practitioners, but do not view as equal practitioners those involved in
everyday practice in their communities---]{.underline}those who in fact
sustain their ecology, livelihoods, security and identities, all while
having to navigate the impact of top-down policies.46 Both the articles
by Jan Wilkens and Alvine Datchoua-Tirvaudey on climate justice, and by
Althea Rivas and Mariam Safi on the organizing and practices of Afghan
women, share knowledge from non-elite local communities and challenge
the above binaries and hierarchies. In their article on climate justice
in the Arctic and the Mediterranean, Wilkens and Datchoua-Tirvaudey
explain that [academic-- practitioner knowledge exchange has often been
a contributing factor in continued climate injustice]{.underline}.47
[The existing patterns of this knowledge exchange on climate governance
are dependent on hierarchies of knowledge, namely, the valorization of
western/'scientific' knowledge production at the expense of the needs
and knowledges of the Indigenous and local communities most affected by
climate change]{.underline} (i.e. the community-based practitioners,
rather than the institutional/state ones). Moreover, [the spaces where
such knowledge exchange takes place are often exclusionary]{.underline}
(in who is invited, in the parameters of discourse and/or in the
extortionate costs of participating[), producing an intra-elite
debate]{.underline}.48 Having identified these racialized patterns, they
offer a corrective decolonial strategy for ethical climate governance,
founded on practice-based knowledge and diverse ways of knowing that
bring in those excluded insights. The article by Rivas and Safi also
provides an example of how the academic-- practitioner nexus can be
'decolonized', one in which everyday knowledges of Afghan women, in all
their diversity and complexity, are centred in peacebuilding efforts.49
Their article, co-written by an academic and a local practitioner,
offers a methodology of how to take into account the internal
hierarchies of positionality, interests and knowledges that are always
present when engaging with grassroots communities for the sake of
'research'. Rivas and Safi also demonstrate the [importance of
registering and valuing the unlooked-for, atypical knowledges from
below,]{.underline} such as the subtle observations offered by Afghan
women in rural areas that, contrary to wider assumptions, reflect their
political engagement and interest[. Caution against extractivism in the
search for such local knowledge exchange is at the forefront of both the
above contributions]{.underline}.50 [Thus academics should remain
reflexive in what the purpose of their research is, and who really
benefits]{.underline}. Moreover[, a praxis of decolonizing such
research]{.underline} necessarily [entails taking time in a way that is
at odds with the current culture of speedy and multitudinous
productivity in academia: the rapid churning out of articles from 'the
field' should raise appropriate questions about how, why and for whom
that research is being conducted.]{.underline}

Power shifts. As Reus-Smit (2017) notes, [challenges to prevailing
regimes of cultural stratification become most pronounced in the face of
shifting material balances of power. Racial prejudice]{.underline},
after all, [is activated by perceived competition with subordinate
racial others in order to maintain the status quo hierarchy]{.underline}
(Bobo 1999[). Racialized threat perceptions]{.underline}, in other
words, [can have the most palpable effects on world politics under the
condition of major power shifts.]{.underline} In conjunction with their
newfound material capabilities, [rising but racially subordinate states
can trigger racialized fears and foreign policy aggression from
declining but racially dominant states]{.underline}. As Adler-Nissen&
Zarakol (2021) point out, [the current challenge to the liberal
international order partly comes from rising non-Western powers such as
China who seek to redress their grievances against what they perceive to
be a Western-centric, and thus White-dominant, global
order]{.underline}. Historically, Japan's revisionist foreign policy in
the early 1930s has also been explained as motivated in large part by
the rising power's frustration with the then more explicitly racialized
Western-dominated inter-national order (Ward 2013). [Dominant powers
simultaneously tend to perceive such challenges with a racial lens,
giving rise to racialized foreign policy narratives, most famously
exemplified by the still popular "Yellow Peril" discourse]{.underline}
(Búzás 2013, Ward 2013). [Perceived racial affinity, on the contrary,
appears to substantially ameliorate fears and uncertainty under power
shifts, again as suggested by the fin de siècle Anglo--American
rapprochement]{.underline} (Vucetic 2011a,b; Edelstein 2017).Future
[research should investigate whether racial fears inflate threats from a
rising China, produce public support for hawkish policies, and
potentially aggravate military tensions]{.underline}. More [studies are
needed]{.underline}, for example, [on the extent to which contemporary
public opinion on China is racialized, how top-down anti-China rhetoric
can activate racial fears, and the potential mechanisms by which racial
prejudice affects actual policy making and crisis
management]{.underline} (see Miller &Taylor 2017; Dionne 2020; Han &
Marwecki 2020; Kim 2020, 2021; Ebner & Medenica 2021). In parallel[,
researchers can pay more attention to how a rising China produces and
manages its own racialized narratives as it promulgates the discourse of
the century of humiliation by the West.]{.underline}

#### Their invocation of ecological catastrophe furthers racial violence by narratively cohering it within a linear temporality of progress.

**Agathangelou, 21**---Associate Professor, Department of Politics, York
University (Anna, "On the question of time, racial capitalism, and the
planetary," Globalizations, 18:6, 880-897, dml) \[brackets in original\]

[Physicists]{.underline}, [spiritual leaders]{.underline}, [and
theorists argue]{.underline} '**[time is not real]{.underline}**'
(Martin, 2020; Rovelli, 2018). [It is a]{.underline} '**[human
construct]{.underline}** ... [to help us **differentiate** between now
and our perception of the past]{.underline}' (Martin, 2020). As a
meaning that human groups have given to change (Tabboni, 2001), [it
**organizes** our systems of thought and our everyday
lives]{.underline}. Time has special meaning in politics, where '[the
**very distinction between truth** and **fiction** has been made
**redundant**]{.underline}' [so that]{.underline} '[the **criterion** is
no longer **accuracy**]{.underline} -- [it's **conformity** to the
**needs of the moment**]{.underline}' (Klein, 2014; emphasis added). Our
present analytical and political challenge is to grapple with the ways
time is entangled with the 'needs of the moment' in areas of energy and
climate change. Yet the politics of the ecological require understanding
time. Notions like succession, simultaneity, duration, urgency, waiting,
speed, geological revolutions, money, and death are expressions of time
and are entangled with the ecological and its models of development.

The increasing risks to the environment as a result of the extraction of
conventional oil and natural gas resources and the increased greenhouse
emissions have led to what the experts have called the climate crisis.
Yet as Klein says, 'despite being convinced of the necessity of
addressing our behavior as regards energy consumption, collective
consciousness appears at once paralyzed and indecisive ... frozen in the
face of the obstacle' (Klein, 2014). Instead of frozen time, Bourriaud
points to the acceleration of time and what this has wrought: 'the great
acceleration also lies within the process of the naturalization of
capitalism: now it has become both organic and universal, it is the
natural law of the Anthropocene' (cited in Chiambaretta, 2017). Mbembe
(2021) expands this argument of the relations of time with the planetary
by arguing [the politics and aesthetics of the ecological require
understanding the coloniality of power and its contemporary temporal
mutations]{.underline}. Imperial expansion, Mbembe argues, was (is) a
planetary project driven by nationalist states and companies to
reallocate the earth's resources through military might and
privatization. [Colonial epistemes and practices of time **block** the
potentiality and affirmation of a planetary **beyond capture** and
**conquest**]{.underline} (Marriott, 2011) but national decolonization
cannot be 'what gives deep breathing for the world' (Mbembe, 2021). Some
physicists speak of 'eternity in relation to time', wherein 'atoms and
the emptiness of the universe are infinite, uncreated, and imperishable'
(Oestreicher, 2012, p. 435). Others speak of chronological and cyclical
time, attributing the first to the West and the latter to the East.
Newton (1643--1727) defined time as a mathematical variable with one
dimension. The only two 'topological objects with this characteristic'
are a 'line and a circle ... . It thus follows that time is either
infinite or cyclic' (Oestreicher, 2012, p. 436). Grappling with the
question of social death, Frank Wilderson argues that [**assembling
black life** into a series of **historical events**]{.underline}, [into
a **narrative** with a **plot**]{.underline} '[is a **catastrophe** for
narrative at a **meta-level** rather than a **crisis** or **aporia**
within a particular narrative]{.underline}' (Wilderson, 2015b). For him,

[narrative time]{.underline} ... [marks **stasis** and **change** within
a]{.underline} \[**[human]{.underline}**\] [paradigm]{.underline},
\[[but]{.underline}\] it does **[not]{.underline}** mark the time of the
\[human\] paradigm, the time of time itself, [the time by which the
**slave's dramatic clock** is set]{.underline}. [For the
slave]{.underline}, [historical]{.underline} '[time]{.underline}' [is
**not possible**]{.underline}. (Wilderson, 2010, p. 339)

In this article I engage with two dominant logics1 and grammars of
time,2 modernity, capitalism, and ecology: time as linear, flowing in a
particular direction (determined sequencing separable in measurable
units), and time as retrojection, defined as 'a kind of projection that
retrospectively testifies to 'what comes before'' (Walker, 2012, p. 268)
or after.3 Examining how these two ideas of time become central to the
co-production of the planetary as a colonial and imperial project will
allow a structural engagement with the emergence and generation of the
conditions for decolonial planetary relations as acts of invention
(Fanon, 1967; Marriott, 2014).

A Caribbean slave proverb, '**[time is longer dan rope]{.underline}**',
challenges the dominant notion of linear time and progress. [The state
and corporations continue to **expropriate black lives** and
**indigenous lands**]{.underline}, thus '[extract\[ing\] surplus
from]{.underline} various processes of [social and ecological
reproduction]{.underline}' (McGee & Greiner, 2020), [including the
**obliteration** of lives]{.underline}. [These structures of death are
**taken for granted**]{.underline}, [including the **colonial linear
structures** of progress and growth]{.underline}, [their contingent
epistemic edifices and the privileges that shape and enable social and
ecological reproduction]{.underline}.

Generally speaking, [**temporal boundaries** are drawn to
render]{.underline} climate change or [**ecological crisis**
theorizable]{.underline} within certain fields, such as environmental,
governance, and conservation studies. However, [that]{.underline} which
is 'inside' or embodies a [temporal trajectory connotes what is present
**in** the economy]{.underline}, [while the]{.underline}
'**[outside]{.underline}**' connotes a void (without time). Rather than
seeing contemporary readers as always irrevocably distanced from such
events, if those who write on climate change focus the language of time,
they [may open up **new possibilities** for bringing to the fore
substantial structures whose temporality or lived experience is
**occluded** or **does not even register** as time]{.underline}. In
fact, [the **pervasive tapestries of violence** and their temporal
structures are **challenged** by]{.underline} theorists of black
thought, indigenous studies, postcolonialism, and Fanonian studies
(Rifkin 2017; Wilderson 2015a, 2015b, 2016; Fanon, 1967). They challenge
historical and linear time, [orienting]{.underline} the reader [toward a
reality that is neither **graspable** nor **conquerable** but a
**flickering reality** of sensed and unsensed]{.underline}
'[actualities]{.underline}, [the moment under the moment]{.underline}'
(Hoban, 1992). They problematize easy readings of structures and
dominant systems of thought and their entanglement with notions of time,
and [they query the collective amnesia of temporal productions and the
racial capitalist-enslaving-colonial global order where]{.underline}, on
the one hand, [things are written on water and evaporate]{.underline}
(Shafak, 2014, p. 2) [and]{.underline}, on the other, [certain ecologies
and lives are **dead on arrival**]{.underline}.

Modernist nationalist and [capitalist iterations of time focus
on]{.underline} linear teleologies/eschatologies. This orientation of
the temporal operates through **[causality]{.underline}**, stories of
[**progress** and **growth**]{.underline}, [the **plausible** and
**possible**]{.underline}, and ideas about movement from past to present
to future and evolution (Wilk, 2007). However, another orientation,
retrojection, I argue, is vital to racial ecological capitalism's
dominant power. [Without engaging with]{.underline} both of [these
structures]{.underline} and operation of time simultaneously, [we
**cannot understand** power and its entanglements with the
planetary]{.underline}. The temporality of capital's projection
retrospectively testifies to what comes before its current organizing.
Retrojection requires us to 'relocate ourselves into the past', while
'assigning purposes and ends to \[such\] actions' (Motzkin, 1992) as
well as a mythical agency to capital. These two expressions of
temporality co-exist, at times in tension. They are inflected in our
institutions and our social life.

In this piece, I look at the structure of time and ecology to trace how
social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences draw on such
structures to colonize, enslave, and imperialize the planetary. I trace
how and when time and temporality bound the Anthropocene. The search is
not for a start date but for the ways the 'date' or the 'when' is a
political, economic, scientific, and ethical question (Davis & Todd,
2017, p. 761; Rifkin 2017; Whyte, 2017; Saldanha, 2020) entangled with
the structure of time and what Fanon calls the invention or new
beginning beyond global capital's projects. I draw on a 2018 report from
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and work by Naomi
Oreskes and Erik M. Conway to register the co-production of the temporal
with 'the domains of nature, facts, objectivity, reason ... policy
\[and\] culture, values, subjectivity, emotions and politics' (Jasanoff,
2004, p. 12).4 I use these works as a springboard for thinking how this
temporal co-production expresses the tension between the reproduction of
capital and the generation of life. To conclude the piece, in
conversation with Octavia E. Butler, I suggest [instead of **dreading**
an impending crisis]{.underline}, [we should **read radically** for the
**ruptures** in the dominant structures of time]{.underline} (i.e. in
narratives, dialectics, etc.) (Marriott, 2011; Wilderson, 2010) [and
their entanglement with questions of the planetary and climate
change]{.underline}. [Such fractal readings may yield insights into
possible **disinvestment** from the fossil economy and open up the
possibility for an **indeterminate world**]{.underline}, [the passionate
and living experimenting with and harnessing of the flux of energy into
a vision of a decolonial whose basic premise is **not conquest** and
**enslavement**]{.underline}.

Liberalism: always too late, or capitalism's colonial and enslaving
proactivity?

In the IPCC reports, time as a linear human orientation is placed in the
context of timescales of forces requiring human intervention but out of
human control: climate change. The recent SRl.5 (IPCC, 2018), 'Global
Warming of 1.5°C', representing the 'newer instalment of the
scientisation of climate change', situates 'the issue beyond democratic
debate by declaring it a matter for the scientific expertise of the
IPCC', and inscribes it as an emergency (Garrard, 2020, p. 1). The
report suggests 'climate change is moving faster than we are'
(Masson-Delmotte et al., 2018, p. v), and its urgency demands our
intervention. However, the moral and ethical articulation of the climate
as a linear temporal 'urgency' does not allow us to understand
ecological shifts or even climate change in a larger trajectory,
including human conquest, property relations, and competition. Rather,
the report's 'foreshortened timeframe' speaks to the urgent need of
global concerted efforts to mitigate climate change and signals how
temporary responses and procrastination are not going to do the trick
(Garrard, 2020, p. 2).

John Mecklin, Editor of Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, similarly reminds
us that time is running out:

Faced with this daunting threat landscape and a new willingness of
political leaders to reject the negotiations and institutions that can
protect civilization over the long term, the Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists Science and Security Board today moves the Doomsday Clock 20
s closer to midnight - closer to apocalypse than ever. (Mecklin, 2020)

The **[moving]{.underline}** of [**the clock** makes the]{.underline}
'[climate emergency]{.underline}' **[public]{.underline}**, especially
[for]{.underline} those [proponents of liberalism whose]{.underline}
'[macroscopic exclusion clauses]{.underline}' [have been written
to]{.underline} '**[displace]{.underline}** ...
**[unfreedom]{.underline}**' [onto all **marginalized**]{.underline},
**[enslaved]{.underline}**, [and **colonized** peoples]{.underline} and
those 'primitive' and 'undeveloped' sites 'from a white male bourgeois
European who was the historical agent in the narrative' (Mann, 2019).
Yet this [moving]{.underline} of [the clock does not address the
**root** of the problem]{.underline}. It [allows the positing of
a]{.underline} secular/**[humanist eschatological story]{.underline}**
(Rothe, 2020, p. 162) [whose temporal structure is one of **immanent
destruction**]{.underline}, informed by an analysis of existence as
being-towards-death (i.e. of the human and the planet) or catastrophe.

Of course, this schematic presumes death and ecological
**[catastrophe]{.underline}** (collapsed into one). It [represents a
**never-reached horizon** of experience]{.underline}, [where
**authentic** and **moral decisions** **must be made** through
a]{.underline} theory or '**[concept of crisis]{.underline}** or
emergency' (Mann, 2019). [Liberal leaders]{.underline} of the
international political system '**[inch toward]{.underline}**' an
[implementation of a **regulatory system**]{.underline}, what Mann and
Wainwright call climate Leviathan, [instead of addressing the **root
causes**]{.underline} of global warming. These leaders are not creative
but 'fumble ... for solutions', continuing to argue that 'climate
change' is a 'market failure, without considering the limiting
structures of the 'market' itself (Osaka, 2019, p. 2; citing Mann &
Wainwright, 2018). [When the moment for **organized challenge**
emerges]{.underline}, [white hegemony rushes to **squander** the
creative energy and **reorients** social relations toward its
consolidation]{.underline}. It does so [by rushing to **innovate**
through the co-production of narratives and an emerging ecological
order]{.underline}.

The present as a fracture of notions of history and 'historical natures'

[Apocalypse is]{.underline} '[the **single most powerful master
metaphor** that the contemporary]{.underline} environmental [imagination
has at its disposal]{.underline}' (Buell, 1995, p. 285). As such, [it
**deranges** capital and its entanglements with ecological
problems]{.underline}, ranging from the climate change, to the
extinction of species, the loss of pollinating insects, and other
ecological disasters. These challenges or this ecology of environmental
concerns cannot be considered in a partitioned manner.

The focus on temporality has been picked up by historians and others
grappling with what the authors of the Anthropocene name a crisis and
emergency. One text that speaks to the global climate change as
apocalyptic temporality is Oreskes and Conway's The Collapse of Western
Civilization. In theorizing the present and the temporal possibilities
for the future otherwise, these authors open the door for us to
experiment with what Sheila Jasanoff and Sang-Hyun call sociotechnical
imaginaries (2013). The book's narrator is a Chinese historian in the
year 2393. The historian says Western civilization possessed robust
information about climate change and the 'damaging events to unfold' but
was 'unable to stop' them (Oreskes & Conway, 2014, p. x, pp. 1-2), thus
'condemning their successors to the inundation and desertification of
the late twenty-first and twentysecond centuries' (Oreskes & Conway,
2014, pp. 59--60). A second Dark Age descended, and the Period of
Penumbra began. The present ignorance, the historian says, is a result
of an 'ideological fixation on 'free' markets; another
compartmentalization and the practice among the scientific community of
demanding an excessively stringent standard for accepting claims of any
kind, even those involving imminent threats' (Oreskes & Conway, 2014,
pp. ix-x). In a sense, this future scenario tells nothing about the
future and more about the 'present' -- our moment.

However, [the]{.underline} narrator's historical [account is
**problematic** and]{.underline}, as Garrard argues '**[unequivocably
dangerous]{.underline}**', [as the scenario]{.underline}
[focus]{.underline}es [on]{.underline} '**[catastrophic
outcomes]{.underline}**' (Garrard, 2020, p. 3). Gallard's critique is
important to our discussion of temporality. Narrating the present as a
given history [**evades** uncertainty and possibilities for the world as
a project **beyond** global capital]{.underline}. In a sense, [this
dystopian temporality posits itself as the]{.underline}
'**[truth]{.underline}**' [of our reality]{.underline} as if punctuating
a certain kind of imaginary temporal orientation -- the only one about
the future. [This]{.underline} depicted history [**anticipates the
failure** of the future by drawing on **assembled empirics** and
**technologies of problem-solving** as if failure and the future are
**not up for debate**]{.underline} (Jasanoff, 2019), as if the
historical codes and genre choices that assemble these dystopia future
scenarios are not 'originary' to the familiar narratives of history
which they ground.

In highlighting that the Anthropocene is actually a 'liberal managerial
term', Mann (2019) suggests the ideology of [liberalism **distorts** the
multiple social reproductions of violence and strategies of failure by
sublimating them through temporal means]{.underline}, [deploying
concepts such as crises]{.underline}, emergencies, and exceptions, [and
substituting adaptation for progress]{.underline}. We see this in
scientific reports, for example, the SRl.5 and others; while they
address the metabolic rifts and shifts, they still use the Anthropocene
as the social contract (Mann, 2019). In Climate Leviathan, Joel
Wainwright and Geoff Mann argue crisis, risk, and uncertainty are
asymmetrical, the result of the actions of a minority of humanity, i.e.
[the white male bourgeois European]{.underline} who [claims the
**agency** and **writing** of the historical narrative of liberalism and
imperial capitalism]{.underline}. The Anthropocene is a technology
co-productive of temporal regimes of modernity and the planetary order:

\[The Anthropocene is\] an explicitly future facing instrument of
temporal power. Like all contracts, it restarts time on its terms. The
distribution of responsibilities it represents is always also the
closure of supersession of past arrangements. So, a contract that has no
expiration, like a constitution or the Anthropocene, is supposed to mark
the end of the past and the beginning of a new time. (Mann & Wainwright,
2018, p. 8)

The Anthropocene is itself a technology of temporal power which orders
and organizes social life. In questioning this contract, Mann and
Wainwright problematize how time is used to organize global power. They
question whether the idea that the Anthropocene marks the end of the
past as many claim and the beginning of a new time is accurate. For
them, this fetishization of the Anthropocene evades the intensifying
challenges to the world. The structure of 'transition' of the
contemporary global order and [the production of]{.underline} history of
[liberalism as progress]{.underline} (Mann & Wainwright, 2018, p. 9) are
problematic and [**do not acknowledge** how such kinds of politics are
co-produced with a structure of transcendental time as their **major
procedural technology** of governance]{.underline}. The transformation
of the world's political economy and the fundamental political
arrangements most people take for granted thus need to be engaged on the
register of the language of temporal power and the global order.

[perpetually absorbed in
conflict](https://www.academia.edu/1053370/The_Myth_of_the_Hundred_Years_Peace_War_in_the_Nineteenth_Century)
during this period -- either via territorial expansion or suppressing
violent colonial uprisings. The Indian Revolt of 1857 alone resulted in
over [6,000 British casualties and left around 800,000 Indians
dead](https://books.google.ca/books?id=dyQuAgAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y) due to
the violence and resulting famine. How can such consistent conflict
occur during a period supposedly marked for its enduring peace? In
international relations discourse, [war is almost [exclusively
defined](https://www-jstor-org.proxy1.lib.uwo.ca/stable/40645028?pq-origsite=summon&seq=5#metadata_info_tab_contents)
as an act between "sovereign powers." Violent acts on any political
entity other than a "state]{.underline}" (i.e. native territories,
proto-states, warlords, etc.), [or those committed *by* political
entities other than a "state]{.underline}", such as the British East
India Company, [are]{.underline} conveniently [removed from the purview
of *international* relations]{.underline}. This [abstraction instantly
sanitizes a violent world history, committed overwhelmingly against
non-whites]{.underline}, that the modern international order is built
upon. The distortionary impact of such a model is exemplified by the
widely popular [democratic peace theory]{.underline}, which [proposes
that democracies are less likely to engage in war]{.underline} than
non-democracies. [This proposition is [historically

imperial
conflict](https://www-jstor-org.proxy1.lib.uwo.ca/stable/pdf/40645028.pdf),
[serves to privilege the Western model in international affairs and
justify colonial and neo-colonial violence today.]{.underline} Both
[liberalism and realism]{.underline}, the dominant paradigms of
contemporary international relations, [operate from a conception of
global anarchy]{.underline} which in many ways enforces the hierarchical
racial dualism associated with early international relations theory.
[International relations' conception of anarchy [is
based](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy1.lib.uwo.ca/doi/full/10.1080/09557571.2012.710585)
in the Hobbesian state of nature]{.underline}, which is presumed to
occur in the absence of the state. However[, Hobbes' only real-life
example of those in the state of nature can be found in ["the savage

America."](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy1.lib.uwo.ca/doi/full/10.1080/09557571.2012.710585)]{.underline}
Implicit in this analysis is the belief that [while civilized democratic
states established international order among themselves, the undesirable
condition of anarchy was found in the backwards, non-white areas, which
relied upon civilized people to impose order for them.]{.underline}
Sampson argues that [underlying the definition of anarchy is a trope of

Islamophobia across Europe in response to the Syrian refugee crisis is a
testament to the modern impact of racism on foreign policy. To evolve
past its harmful Eurocentric biases, [international relations must
abandon its colonial-era precepts and formally integrate the critical

Foreign economic policy. Th[e effects of race and racism can also be
found in foreign economic policy.]{.underline} [Critical race
scholarship in IR has long pointed out the enduring legacies of
colonialism as manifested]{.underline}, for instance, [in the global
labor regime]{.underline}. Immigrant laborers continue to be subject to
the racialized practices of labor exploitation (Persaud 2001).
[Racialized global inequality also permeates other domains such as
North--South trade relations and aid regimes]{.underline}. Rosenberg
(2019)provides systematic evidence of how racism affects global
migration flows, showing that [migrants from majority-Black states
migrate significantly less than they would under a racially blind
hypothetical scenario.]{.underline} Focusing on the role of more subtle
forms of modern-day racism, Singh (2017)shows that [the global North
continues to offer unfavorable trade terms to the global
South.]{.underline} Scholars have also placed racism at the center of
the global aid regimes, finding that paternalism (Baker2015, Baker &
Prather 2021) and racial resentment (Simon & Moltz 2019) play a large
role in garnering public support for foreign aid. One particularly
promising area of research centers on the increasing racialization of
international trade, engaging conventional theories of trade policy
preference in international political economy. Utilizing survey
experiments and multiyear public opinion surveys, a group of scholars
finds that [the racial identity of a potential trading partner has
become increasingly important for American public support for overseas
trade, often at the cost of the respondent's material
self-interest.]{.underline} These recent studies find that such racial
considerations are most prominent among [White Americans who have become
far more protectionist than other racial groups in the
country]{.underline} (Guisinger 2017). Supported by evidence from
multiple surveys, Mutz et al. (2020) point to higher levels of racial
prejudice among Whites as one potential source of the growing race gap
in trade attitudes. As the United States comes closer to becoming a
"majority-minority" nation[, future research might further investigate
the sources and political consequences of the race gap in trade and
other foreign policy issues]{.underline}.

Political Science at Rutgers University, Melanie, Senior Lecturer in
International Relations and Director of the Centre for Advanced
International Theory, "Is securitization theory racist? Civilizationism,
methodological whiteness, and antiblack thought in the Copenhagen
School", CS)

First, [feminist scholars of securitization theory have questioned
whether the theory can account for gender relations]{.underline}
(Hansen, 2000; Heck and Schlag, 2013; Hoogensen and Rottem, 2004; H.
Hudson, 2005; N. F. Hudson, 2009; Kearns, 2017). Much of this research
is inspired by Hansen's (2000) widely cited article that argues that
classic securitization theory's limitations regarding gender are
methodological: speech act theory cannot account for the gendered power
dynamics that underpin situations when speech is not possible. Hansen
illustrates these methodological shortcomings through the fable of the
Little Mermaid, wittily locating the analysis in Copenhagen, then
abruptly travels to Pakistan and Bosnia for empirical evidence. There,
Hansen (2000: 299) finds 'honour killings' and 'raped Muslim women' who
are deemed to be silent. This [Orientalist imaginary constructs a racial
opposition: white Western women, who have achieved legitimacy as vocal
political actors, versus 'silent' subaltern women]{.underline}
(Abu-Lughod, 2002; on securitization theory, see Bertrand, 2018). [This
elides gendered insecurity]{.underline} in places like Denmark, [where
'gender equality' is often figured in white supremacist discourses as a
mark of civilization threatened]{.underline}, for instance, by
Muslimified (Richter-Montpetit, 2014: 45) immigrants. So, [in core
feminist securitization theory texts, we find that Eurocentric and
racist thought is reaffirmed rather than challenged.]{.underline}
Second, securitization theory's Eurocentrism has been challenged by
scholarship that asks whether applying securitization theory to the
non-West upends or modifies the theory (Bilgin, 2010, 2011; Wilkinson,
2007), a question echoed by some of securitization theory's original
proponents (see Greenwood and Wæver, 2013). However, [securitization
theory has never ignored the 'non-West']{.underline}. As we will show,
[it draws heavily on racist accounts of spaces outside Europe that reify
a stark division between 'West' and 'non-West' without examining
colonial relationalities]{.underline}. Critics of securitization
theory's Eurocentrism assert that [we cannot assume a (functioning,
democratic) European state in non-West spaces, but ignore the
(settler-)colonial underpinnings of the state system and border
cartographies]{.underline}. Seeing the issue solely as the analytical
exclusion of the 'non-West', they decry 'Eurocentrism' while retaining
racist political thought. We adopt a more robust analysis (see
Sabaratnam, 2013) that views Eurocentrism as involving the ideas that:
(1) 'Europe' or 'the West' is ontologically distinctive; (2) European
development was endogenous; and (3) European cultural and political
achievements were subsequently diffused across the world. Additionally,
we deploy concepts beyond Eurocentrism (civilizationism, methodological
whiteness, and antiblack racism) to grapple with the role of racist
political thought in securitization theory.

### Link\-\--Hegemony

#### Notions of US leadership further [racialized governance]{.underline} and [interventions]{.underline}.

Beyond the "Norm Against Noticing"", CS)

Although engagement varies across the movement of critical race theories
and Third World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL), much of the
work within these reconstructive traditions has sought to uncover the
ongoing dynamics of racialized power that constitute international law
and relations. [The racialization of international law can be seen
in]{.underline} several contemporary legal and [political trends that
are at least implicitly premised on a conception of non-White-majority
countries as being deficient and in need of assistance or corrective
action by North American or European states]{.underline}. Good
governance. [The program of good governance and its strategic promotion
in the non-European world]{.underline} illustrates this point. A term
that gained considerable prominence in the field during the 1990s, good
governance [became a way of organizing, interpreting, and deploying
legal doctrines in international politics]{.underline}. While norms
entrepreneurs in various international and non-governmental
organizations herald the concept as an advance in international law,
critics note that it bears an old lineage of racialized dispossession.
[Influential development institutions]{.underline} such as the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as well as human rights
groups[, promote standards of governance that are seen as already
perfected in the European world.]{.underline} On the other hand,
[non-White-majority societies are imagined in perpetual lack of the good
governance needed for stability and progress]{.underline}. Countries
that lack good governance, thus, are understood as lacking some quality
implicitly assigned to White countries. According to Anghie (2006),
[good governance was invoked to create non-European governments that
would facilitate European commercial expansion]{.underline}. Grovogui
(1996) similarly explicates [international law as "outside
administration" by a West that seeks to maintain its imperial holdings
long after its withdrawa]{.underline}l. Status of Forces Agreements.
Extraterritoriality in US Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) betrays
similar assumptions about state capacity and governance. SOFAs establish
when and how the domestic laws of host governments are applied to US
military personnel stationed in those countries (Yeo 2014, Efrat 2022).
While these agreements stop short of immunizing US troops against
criminal sanctions, SOFAs effectively constrain the legal authority host
countries exercise over US forces. At their core, SOFAs attempt to
reconcile US interest in safeguarding soldiers' rights with deeply held
beliefs about the inferiority of non-European institutions and courts
(Freeman 2021).Foreign basing contracts like SOFAs---a bargained concept
of hierarchy---are not beyond prevailing symbols of subordination that
reinforce pathologies of colonial legal regimes (Cooley 2017,Allen et
al. 2020). [The notion that non-Europeans lack "government suited to the
white man" has long been embraced as "just cause" for extraterritorial
jurisdiction, and in some cases, capitulation]{.underline}(Grovogui
1996, p. 51). [A hallmark of Western foreign policy, extraterritoriality
declares a kind of state of emergency where normal rules do not
apply]{.underline} (Ruskola 2008). Variation in US SOFA jurisdiction
conveys a similar story. The United States imposes concurrent
jurisdiction to govern its interactions with predominantly European host
states, allowing these peer countries to try US personnel while
withholding this same right from most non-European host partners,
ceteris pribus (Freeman 2021). Since immunity relies on the premise of
inherent difference between peoples and societies (Cassel 2011), it
affirms prevailing beliefs about racial difference. Thus, hierarchical
conceptions of race are reified through extraterritorial jurisdiction
and its codification into the SOFA Responsibility to Protect.
Unanimously endorsed at the UN World Summit in 2005, the Responsibility
to Protect (R2P) represents a collective commitment to atrocity
prevention. [Viewing authorized intervention as responsibility
constitutes a departure from the norm]{.underline} of nonintervention
established in the Montevideo Convention of 1933 and incorporated into
the UN Char-ter. [R2P engenders and reproduces international hierarchy
through its normative diminution of sovereignty]{.underline} (Getachew
2019a). Integral to this process is [the recasting of sovereignty as
responsibility, a concept that invents the conditions for intervention
in ways that are racially biased]{.underline}. Notwithstanding the
African origins of R2P, often cited to thwart charges of
neo-imperialism, [the doctrine of responsibility appeals to the paternal
protection common in colonial philosophy]{.underline}. To be sure, [the
shadow of racial hierarchy in international law is long]{.underline}.
From [the Berlin Treaty]{.underline}, which "enshrined the
responsibility of Europe in watching over and improving the conditions
of native populations" (Gathii 1998, p. 202; emphasis original), to [the
League of Nations settlement]{.underline}, which excluded those lowest
in the race hierarchy from its international supervisory mechanism (the
mandate system), racism and the rhetoric of responsibility are
constitutive of the principle and need for intervention (Gathii 1998,
Grovogui 1996). R2P is no exception. [The principle renders sovereignty
conditional upon the evaluations of international
institutions]{.underline} (like the UN Security Council) [that are
empowered to decide when a state has failed to fulfill its
responsibility]{.underline} (Getachew2019a). [At its core, R2P reflects
the same projection of deficiency onto non-White countries, promoting
the idea that countries lack either the will or the capacity to treat
their domestic populations equitably and fairly.]{.underline} The fruit
of this alleged failure of responsibility is the near-exclusive
application of R2P toward African states

### Link\-\--Humanitarian Aid

#### Humanitarian intervention is [intrinsically racialized]{.underline}\-\--it promotes a [white savior complex]{.underline} that [locks]{.underline} non-whites into [supposed origins]{.underline}.

**Lynch 19**(Cecilia, Professor in the department of political science
at the University of California, Irvine, "The moral aporia of race in
international relations", CS)

[This humanitarian order brings together western and transnationalized
publics with states and U.N. agencies to create new forms of
'partnership']{.underline} (one of the new buzzwords for implementing
post-Cold War moral codes).68 In these relationships[, nongovernmental
organizations are delegated to give 'early warning' of conflict, and
provide aid in sites of suffering. The 'Responsibility to
Protect']{.underline} (R2P) and the International Criminal Court, new
components of the IR/IP architecture, [provide post-Cold War
justifications for varying degrees of military
intervention]{.underline}.[69 These interventions privilege interference
in Africa and Asia while overlooking crimes against humanity committed
by countries such as the United States and United Kingdom in Iraq and
Afghanistan]{.underline}, according to critics.70 Economic intervention
occurs in the form of humanitarian and development aid by a complex of
nongovernmental organizations, UN agencies, and state donor agencies.
[Such aid has become 'neoliberalized' into a kind of Foucauldian
governmentality, in which nongovernmental humanitarian organizations
work hand-in-glove with state and UN agencies to provide assistance
according to market logics.]{.underline} These [logics promote
interventions that seek]{.underline} (albeit often unsuccessfully) [to
obtain quick results for limited investment of time and
money]{.underline},71 [in the process inscribing racialized victimhood
on populations of the global south]{.underline}. Humanitarian
[government highlights violence]{.underline} to non-white bodies, but
does so [in ways that erase white/northern responsibility for the
fragility of political and economic structures within the global
south.]{.underline} These interventions inherit and continue the
racialized phantasms of earlier interventions in Congo and Biafra, among
numerous others. Cilas Kemedjio, for example, argues that the moral
discourses of nongovernmental groups who wanted to aid starving Biafrans
in the late 1960s established the foundation for contemporary military
interventionism in the present. Kemedjio highlights in particular[, the
racialization of late-colonial and postcolonial moral codes that seek to
save non-white bodies from themselves and their
environments.]{.underline}72 Although realists and liberals debate the
degree to which state interests should limit or foster intervention in
societies riven by violence, critics show how [the 'humanitarian
international' established and perpetuates a 'white saviour industrial
complex' that has the effect, in both IP and IR, of once again locking
'non-whites ... in\[to\] their supposed origins'.]{.underline}73

### Link\-\--Revisionism

#### Their notions of a [perceived revisionist]{.underline} get [operationalized]{.underline} to enforce a [new]{.underline}, [violent understanding]{.underline} of international politics

**Lake et al. 21**(David, Distinguished Professor of Political Science

Kim, Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at the
University of California, San Diego, "Race in International Relations:
Beyond the "Norm Against Noticing"", CS)

[The recent worldwide surge in anti-Asian hate at the height of the
pandemic calls for renewed attention on how race and racism connect to
international politics.]{.underline} Fueled by inflammatory elite
rhetoric, [deep-seated racial animus has far-reaching implications
for]{.underline} not only domestic racial relations but also interstate,
and most importantly, [great power relations]{.underline} (Dionne 2020;
Kim 2020,2021; Reny & Barreto 2020). As we shall see, [race and racism
can affect the way foreign threats are perceived, competing visions of
national interest are deliberated, and foreign policy responses are
selected]{.underline}. Having elucidated international law as a
projection of racial deficiency, we now turn to the second face of
racism, namely [the perception of racial others as potential threats.
Notions of deficiency and hostility, though seemingly contradictory,
straddle a key feature of racial hierarchy. Subordinate racial groups
are considered not only inferior but potentially threatening to the
status quo.]{.underline} [Dominant actors within a racialized
international order]{.underline}, in other words, [perceive racial
others as a latent threat to their own interests, and by extension,
their identity]{.underline}. [Racial hierarchy thus directly conditions
how state actors interpret the behavior of racial others, assess their
own interests, and cope with felt challenges to their
status]{.underline}. Understanding this element of racial hierarchy can
help us reexamine the overlooked role of race and racism in shaping a
wide range of foreign policy preferences and decision making. In the
language of Reus-Smit (2017, p. 879), though he avoids explicit
reference to race, [an international order is a configuration of
political authority in which the need for legitimacy requires complex
heterogeneity to be converted into authorized forms of
cultural---including racial---difference]{.underline}. [Racial
hierarchy, by extension, provides a key source of legitimacy for an
unequal global order, engendering "intersubjective understandings
about\...the appropriateness of its constituent role
identities]{.underline}" (Reus-Smit 2017, p. 879). Under such prevailing
"diversity regimes," [subordinate groups are perceived as a latent
existential threat with potentially revisionist intent and incompatible
interests]{.underline}. Sociological and psychological understandings of
racial hierarchy also suggest that it is through the effect of [racial
prejudice]{.underline} that [dominant groups evaluate threats from
racial others and formulate their behavioral responses.]{.underline}
Building on Blumer's (1958) group position theory of prejudice, Bobo
(1999) posits that [racial prejudice involves more than negative
feelings or stereotypes and instead derives more fundamentally from a
felt challenge to the sense of relative group position]{.underline}. The
long tradition of social dominance theory also attributes the source of
racial prejudice and violence to the human predisposition to maintain
group-based social hierarchies(Sidanius & Pratto 1999). Conceived in
this way, racism is related to but goes beyond social identity theory,
which posits an innate human tendency toward in-group favoritism and
out-group discrimination (Tajfel & Turner 1979). [By socializing state
actors into constituent identities and interests, racial hierarchy turns
attention away from simple out-group tensions to threats to group status
and, thus, shows how racism can play a deeper role in shaping perceived
foreign threats, national interest, and ultimately foreign policy
behaviors.]{.underline}

### Link\-\--Securitization

#### Their [securitization narrative]{.underline} perpetuates the idea of the ["West and the Rest"]{.underline}, non-Eurocentric civilizations are viewed as [primitive]{.underline}, justifying the [violent assertion]{.underline} of U.S. leadership 

**Howell and Richter-Montpetit 20**(Alison, Associate Professor of
Political Science at Rutgers University, Melanie, Senior Lecturer in
International Relations and Director of the Centre for Advanced
International Theory, "Is securitization theory racist? Civilizationism,
methodological whiteness, and antiblack thought in the Copenhagen
School", CS)

[Securitization theory similarly occludes the racial violence of normal
(liberal) politics]{.underline}. This is not just a conceptual problem:
[it results in major empirical oversights]{.underline}. For example,
though it contains the word 'security', securitization theory places
social security outside of its frame of analysis, as part of 'normal
politics': 'Although it shares some qualities with "social security," or
security as applied to various civilian guard or police functions,
[international security has its own distinctive, more extreme
meaning.]{.underline} Unlike social security, which has strong links to
matters of entitlement and social justice, [international security is
more firmly rooted in the traditions of power politics']{.underline}
(Buzan et al., 1998: 21). [Securitization theory overlooks the power
politics of social security and cannot see how Western welfare state
social security systems support white]{.underline} (settler)
[heteropatriarchal forms of life, such as the nuclear
family]{.underline} (Arvin et al., 2013; Cohen, 1997; Duggan, 2003;
Kandaswamy, 2008), and [disproportionately target racialized,
indigenous, and poor communities]{.underline} for direct and violent
interventions such as the removal of children from families through
enslavement, the residential schools that formed part of the genocide of
indigenous people, child welfare systems, migrant detention and removal,
and so on. Closer to Copenhagen: Denmark now uses socialized daycare as
a means for removing and assimilating Muslim children (Salem, 2018).
Social and national security are imbricated. For example, current
Islamophobic counter-terrorism programs often use social and health
services to identify suspected 'terrorists' (Kundnani, 2014; Qurashi,
2018; Qureshi, 2015). Social security only entails 'entitlement and
social justice' for those privileged by whiteness, heterosexuality,
citizenship, and/or class status. Securitization theory's
civilizationist idealization of 'normal politics' occludes these
dynamics. More strikingly still, Copenhagen School theorists view
policing as a positive force: 'In the West, the police are normally an
institutionalized part of society that ensures continuous functioning'
(Buzan et al., 1998: 54). They praise the pacification role of the
modern state (Greenwood and Wæver, 2013: 489) and ignore the
longstanding use of police in defending class and racial inequality and
(hetero)sexual mores (Amar, 2013; Browne, 2015; Davis, 2003; James,
2000; Kelley, 2000; Sexton, 2007; Singh, 2016), and violently occupying
indigenous land (Bell and Schreiner, 2018; Byrd, 2011; Dhillon, 2015;
Fanon, 1963; Nettelbeck and Smandych, 2010; Razack 2015). Securitization
theory also repeatedly refers to the US War on Drugs as a 'niche
securitization' (Buzan and Wæver, 2003: 327--331, 2009: 265). This
minimizes the transnational history of antiblack violence perpetrated by
the US state leading into the mass incarceration of black and Latinx
people (Davis, 2003; James, 2000; Rodriguez, 2006) and ignores American
covert and counterinsurgency action globally, especially in Latin
America. Policing ensures 'good' order for those privileged by
whiteness, property ownership, gender norms, and/or settler status. The
constitutive role of policing and law in the racial, (settler-)colonial,
sexual, and class violence of 'normal politics' is occluded as a direct
result of securitization theory's reliance on civilizationist
oppositions between politics versus security and politicization versus
securitization. Classic securitization theory is civilizationist in that
[it believes that there are more or less politically and morally
developed civilizations.]{.underline} It identifies 'normal politics'
with (European) civilization and 'securitization' with a return to
(racialized) primal anarchy. As a result, [it depicts 'underdeveloped'
civilizations as threats to supposedly more advanced ones]{.underline}.
This becomes especially clear when examining securitization theory's
ideas about ['state failure'. Securitization theory claims that in
'developed' states]{.underline} (Buzan et al., 1998: 28) a [civilized
political sphere generally fends off securitization, except when
'securitization is unavoidable, as when states are faced with an
implacable or barbarian aggressor' (]{.underline}Buzan et al., 1998:
29). By contrast, [in 'failed' or 'weak' states securitization runs
amok: 'In well-developed states, armed forces and intelligence services
are carefully separated from normal political life, and their use is
subject to elaborate procedures of authorization]{.underline}. Where
such separation is not in place, as in many weak states ... much of
normal politics is pushed into the security realm' (Buzan et al., 1998:
28). [This excessive securitization,]{.underline} in turn, [leads to
primal]{.underline} (or 'Hobbesian' or 'Kaplanesque') [anarchy, wherein
the state 'fails to take root or spirals into
disintegration]{.underline}. [This situation can lead to prolonged
periods of primal anarchy, as is currently the case in Afghanistan and
various parts of Africa, in which the state is only a shadow and reality
is one of rival warlords and gangs']{.underline} (Buzan et al., 1998:
50, emphasis added; for analysis of the colonial preoccupation with
Afghan 'tribes', see Manchanda, 2018). Discourses of state failure are
'irredeemably rooted in an imperial and racialized imagination'
(Gruffydd Jones, 2015: 65; see also Grovogui, 2001; Shilliam, 2013; Wai,
2012a, 2012b). While they may avoid overt reference to race, [they
operate within a lineage of racial discourse that emerged to justify
colonialism and continuing trusteeship]{.underline}. This racial
hierarchy is fully represented in securitization theory's list of weak
and failing states: Nigeria under Abacha, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Somalia,
Liberia, and 'various parts of Africa', the USSR under Stalin, Bosnia,
Colombia, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and so on (see Buzan et al., 1998:
28, 50, 69, 146). This is a racial discourse: 'primal anarchy' is
primarily located in 'brown' ('Afghanistan') and 'black' ('parts of
Africa') regions.

### Link\-\--Security Policy

#### Security politics plays a [key role]{.underline} in [reinforcing]{.underline} a racialized lens of [politics]{.underline}, enforcing [scapegoating]{.underline} and [denial]{.underline} from political spheres.

**Lake et al. 21**(David, Distinguished Professor of Political Science

Foreign security policy. First, [racial hierarchy, through "colored"
perceptions of foreign threats and national interest, has direct
implications for how countries conduct foreign policy on a wide range of
security and military issues, including alliance politics, regional
order building, and territorial expansion.]{.underline} A few
exceptional works on race in IR have emphasized that **[racial identity
can be an important factor in the formation, stability, and durability
of alliances in international politics]{.underline}**. Focusing on the
case of the Anglo-Japanese alliance (1902--1923),Búzás (2013) proposes
that [racial prejudice inflates perceptions of threat and aggressive
intentions from racially dissimilar countries.]{.underline} He finds
through extensive archival research that racial difference came to
inflate British threat perceptions of Japan, predisposing the two allies
toward discord and eventually the termination of the alliance at the
1921 Washington Conference. At the same time, [Anglo--American racial
similarity saved the United States and Britain from such racialized
fears, despite frequent military tensions including the Venezuela crisis
of]{.underline} 1895--1896. [The dominant racial discourse of the
trans-Atlantic Anglo-Saxon brotherhood drew the two countries toward
foreign policy cooperation to a greater extent "than any other
comparable pairs of states]{.underline}" (Vucetic 2011a, p. 403). Bell
(2013) [further notes that this prevailing White supremacist vision
undergirded the fin de siècle discussion of racial utopianism---the
claim that an Anglo-Saxon security community would eliminate all forms
of interstate conflict]{.underline} (see also Vucetic 2011b[).Racialized
beliefs can also have]{.underline} far-reaching [effects on other types
of foreign security and military policies such as regional
institution-building and territorial expansion.]{.underline} Hemmer
&Katzenstein (2002) argue that [perceived racial identity]{.underline},
among other components of collective identity, [played an
important]{.underline} yet underappreciated [role in shaping starkly
different American approaches to regional orders in postwar Europe and
Asia]{.underline}. [Despite a huge disparity in material capabilities
between the United States and its regional allies in both regions,
American policymakers established multilateral security institutions in
Europe while opting for a hub-and-spokes system of bilateral alliances
in Asia]{.underline}. **[Postwar foreign policy elites viewed their
potential Asian partners as part of an inferior race who were less
trustworthy and thus ineligible for membership in a NATO-like
multilateral security community.]{.underline}** Maass (2020) shows that
the perception of the native population as racially inferior, dangerous,
and thus inherently unsuited for republican governance also explains the
limited American territorial expansion in Mexico.

### Link\-\--Space

#### The 1AC forwards [racist mythologies]{.underline} of white dominance over space. Their framing matters.

**Haskins, 18**---The Outline, citing Michael Ralph, professor of
anthropology at NYU and Lucianne Walkowicz, Chair of Astrobiology at the
Library of Congress (Caroline, "THE RACIST LANGUAGE OF SPACE
EXPLORATION,"
<https://theoutline.com/post/5809/the-racist-language-of-space-exploration?zd=1&zi=ix5ripys>,
dml)

"You could argue that [the effort to colonize space is **likely** to
involve **new forms of inequality**: **shifts in tax revenues** and
**administrative priorities**]{.underline} devoted to that," said
Michael Ralph, a professor of anthropology at NYU. "[As **opposed** to
\[supporting\] other social institutions that benefit people like
**health care**, **education**, **infrastructure**]{.underline}."

[Earning money in space is an **exciting prospect** for a **far-right**,
**pro-business**, **anti-regulation politician**]{.underline} like Cruz,
and he explicitly associated it with European countries having colonized
the Americas. Starting in the late 1400s, Great Britain, Spain, and
Portugal funded missions to the Americas in order to gather natural
resources that would power up their economies. By stealing the land that
made this resource extraction possible, colonizers used genocide,
enslavement, biological weaponry, and warfare and that resulted in the
deaths of tens of millions of indigenous people living in the "New
World." The concept of race, and therefore racism, was invented as a way
of justifying their violence and legitimizing a hierarchy of
race-divided labor.

Based off of what we know right now, the Moon and Mars are devoid of
life, so this colonizing language is not actually putting other beings
at risk. But, [there is the risk that the **same racist mythology** used
to **justify violence** and **inequality** on earth]{.underline} ---
such as the use of frontier, "cowboy" mythology to condone and promote
the murder and displacement of indigenous people in the American West
--- [will be used to **justify missions to space**]{.underline}. In a
future where humans potentially do live on non-earth planets, [that same
racist mythology would **carry through** to who is **allowed
to**]{.underline} exist on, and [**benefit** from]{.underline},
[extraterrestrial spaces]{.underline}.

On Earth, and in the United States specifically, the ideal of a
merit-based society has been used to justify race-blind hiring policies
that fail to account for, say, the implicit bias against black or
Asian-sounding names, or the legacy of segregation, which continues to
make children of color more vulnerable to attending underfunded schools.
Narratives of "law and order" have also been used to justify racial
profiling and harsher prison sentences for people of color than for
white people who commit the same crimes. Not nearly enough work has been
done here on Earth to ensure that these structural inequalities wouldn't
carry through.

"Those [narratives]{.underline} do [**carry specific implications**
about how people living on other worlds might be
**structured**]{.underline}," Lucianne Walkowicz, the current Chair of
Astrobiology at the Library of Congress, told The Outline. Walkowicz
organized the Decolonizing Mars Conference that took place on June 27 as
well as a public follow-up event planned for September, to discuss how
[colonial language is **shaping our potential future** in
space]{.underline}. "[Space is **not just built for nothing**, it's
**built for people**]{.underline}."

[When we think about humanity's **potential to exist on other planets**,
it's **important** to consider **who won't have access to
space**]{.underline}, in part [due to a **total lack of concern** over
these issues by people who are **able to access it**]{.underline}.
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos intends to make space a place for the rich to use
for adventure leisure, and SpaceX/Tesla founder Elon Musk has proposed
that a Martian "colony" can save a selection of humanity from the
collapse of civilization in some World War III scenario. Granted, right
now, [these]{.underline} are just [words]{.underline} from billionaires
who want to excite the public about their business ventures. But they
[suggest that if the **economically** and **socially vulnerable are
priced out** of a life-saving journey from Earth, it is a **justifiable
loss**]{.underline}.

"All of [these things]{.underline} that are said off the cuff \[by
billionaires\] [have]{.underline} some [implications that are
**concrete** and **count some people in**, and **some people
out**]{.underline}," Walkowicz said.

Part of that concern is fueled by the fact that Cruz and Pence have
presented the path to settling space as one that will be privately
funded, but lead by the U.S. government. In the Destination Mars
subcommittee meeting, Cruz said, "At the end of the day, the commercial
sector is going to be able to invest billions more in dollars in getting
this job \[of getting to Mars\] done." In his Thursday remarks regarding
the Space Force, Pence also implied that celestial territories would be
treated as private property (even though owning private property in
space is explicitly illegal per the Outer Space Treaty, which the U.S.
and dozens of other nations signed in 1967).

"While other nations increasingly possess the capability to operate in
space, not all of them share our commitment to freedom, to private
property, and the rule of law," Pence said. "So as we continue to carry
American leadership in space, so also will we carry America's commitment
to freedom into this new frontier."

This approach to public-private partnerships directly mirrors colonist
practices. For instance, the British East India Company violently
colonized parts of India on behalf of the company, but over time,
ownership of the stolen land shifted to Great Britain.

While these risks feel a part of a far away future, in the present,
idealizing colonization as a positive, replicable aspect of American
history speaks to an unsettling indifference from leaders about the
violent history of colonization. And by referencing historical events
that victimized people of color, leaders paint a vision of the future in
which people of color continue to be excluded, Walkowicz said that the
social and economic legacy of colonization is ignored.

By using narratives of adventurism and heroics, white Americans were
able to convince other white Americans that they were not only entitled
to steal and conquest land and persons, but that it was their destiny.
Ralph said to The Outline that this mythology remains central to the way
Americans conceptualize their history and culture.

"Colonization is portrayed as a heroic conquest," Ralph said. "These
practices are framed as central to American identity, essential to
governance, politics, and all major social institution. But not depicted
as a colonizing that is one caused by violence, displacement,
dispossession."

Even when people aren't explicitly referring to settlements in space as
"colonies," they still use the rhetoric of colonizing the New World and
the American frontier, which erases the stories of and violence against
the people of color who lived and ranched in the region. But how did
this language start being used in the first place?

Presidents have also used frontierism and colonialism to get white
citizens behind their agenda. When President John F. Kennedy announced
his intention to bring Americans to the Moon in 1962, he paraphrased one
of the earliest colonists on the North American continent.

"William Bradford, speaking in 1630 of the founding of the Plymouth Bay
Colony, said that all great and honorable actions are accompanied with
great difficulties, and both must be enterprised and overcome with
answerable courage," Kennedy said.

Bradford was the governor of the Plymouth Bay Colony at the time of the
Pequot War. In an overnight attack, British colonizers massacred four
hundred soldiers, non-soldiers, and children. Bradford later described
the act of genocide as a Christian victory. "\...victory seemed a sweet
sacrifice, and they gave the prays therof to God," Bradford wrote, "who
had wrought so wonderfully for them, thus to inclose their enemies in
their hands, and give them so speedy a victory over so proud and
insulting an enemy."

Although Kennedy did not characterize his vision for the Moon as
creating a "colony" specifically, the association he wanted to create is
clear: The Moon is the next version of the New World, the next frontier
for American conquest.

In his speech, Kennedy continues that men like Bradford teach us that
"man, in his quest for knowledge and progress, is determined and cannot
be deterred." However, if "man" is a stand-in for "white colonizers,"
"knowledge and progress" unabashedly brushes over the lives of
indigenous persons and people of color that were lost in their quest to
"explore." It's a profusely sanitized version of reality.

"It's fascinating that a term like 'colonizing' can be seen in neutral
terms when it can't exist without violence and dispossession," Ralph
said. It can't exist without violence to establish a political
hierarchy. Every colonial project is about managing populations,
subjugating people, extracting resources."

But Kennedy was not the first person to use of colonizing language in
the context of space. John Wilkins, one of the first people who ever
theorized about humanity's future in space, wrote "A Discourse
Concerning a New World and Another Planet" back in 1638, where he argued
that the Moon will be a place for human habitation in the future.
Although it was a piece of science fiction theorization at the time,
Wilkins justified his argument by saying that God created the Earth and
stars for people to use in his honor.

Colonizers are adventurers, Wilkins argues, whose ideals are worth
replicating on other planets. "The invention of some other means for our
convenience to the Moon cannot seem more incredible to us, than this did
at first to them, to be discouraged in our hopes of the like success,"
Wilkins wrote, admitting that any mission to the moon would be far in
the future. "We have not now any \[Sir Francis\] Drake, or Columbus, to
undertake this voyage, or any Daedalus to invent a convenience through
the air."

Sir Francis Drake was a slave-trader, and of course, Christopher
Columbus is responsible for the genocide of almost 3 million people on
the island of Hispaniola (now the Dominican Republic and Haiti).

As space travel has become more technologically feasible,
science-fiction writers have speculated about how a space society would
actually function. Arthur C. Clarke envisioned that "colonial" would be
a dirty word in space in his 1954 book Earthflight: "And to do \[enter
Solar politics\], one had to go to Earth; as in the days of the Caesars,
there was no alternative. Those who believed otherwise or pretended to
--- risked being tagged with the dreaded word 'colonial.'"

For Clarke, colonialism was equated with privilege in a space society,
not because of racism and violence on Earth. Later in the novel, Clarke
doesn't hesitate to compare travelling between planets, and the nobility
of doing so, with British colonizers travelling between continents in
earlier centuries.

Adilifu Nama, a professor of African American Studies at Loyola
Marymount University who has written about the representation of race in
science fiction, said that science fiction movies and books during the
1950s and 1960s often included narratives of invasion from alien
lifeforms directly alongside conceptualizations of existing in other
worlds. These anxious science fiction narratives became popular during
the Civil Rights Movement.

"We had \[an\] invasion emerging \[during the Civil Rights Movement\] of
black folks invading these once pristine white spaces: with public
transportation, public schools, and eventually particular neighbourhoods
and black folks having access to better, more upscale neighbourhoods,"
Nama said. "So there is also this invasion society around racial purity,
and the tensions of science fiction can be read not only as Cold War
anxieties, but racial anxieties about the other."

Ralph said to The Outline that [the Space Race]{.underline} of the 1950s
and 60s [shouldn't be seen as **purely a nationalist
competition**]{.underline} between the U.S. and Soviet Union: [it was
also a **distraction from the Civil Rights Movement**]{.underline}.

"A lot of what we think of as the Space Race was the US and Russia
competing as rivals for supremacy in space back in the 1950s, but also
that movement was about civil rights and the struggle for justice for
Americans," Ralph said. "In a way, you could argue that
[space]{.underline} exploration [has **historically been used to shift
public attention away** from the struggle of **social
justice**]{.underline}."

According to Walkowicz, that [people dip into the **violent**, **racist
history** of colonialism and **gloss over** their language
using]{.underline} a sense of adventure provided by the American
frontier is no coincidence. "The people for whom the American frontier
myth were constructed, who were primarily white men, also now have [the
**narrative of space**]{.underline}," Walkowicz said. "And because tech
is so incredibly non-diverse, and has been so slow to change even in
those small ways in which it has, I think a lot of [those narratives
**go unquestioned**]{.underline}."

[The people with the power to **make a future in space
possible**]{.underline}, such as Trump, Pence, and Cruz, [or the **money
to actually get us there**]{.underline}, like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos,
[are the same people who **have** and **will always benefit from
systemic racism** and the **potential economic glory** from new economic
ventures]{.underline}.

Ralph noted that [prioritizing space travel **undermines funding for
sustainable forms of energy** like wind and solar, and **efficient ways
to construct affordable houses** and **schools**. It also has **direct
economic implications** for the people who rely on]{.underline} any
number of **[federally-funded social programs]{.underline}** in the U.S.

"In Trump's America, [we have a lot of conservatives and even
libertarians insisting there's **too much government spending** on
social programs, and]{.underline} yet [Trump wants to **use our federal
funds to reinvigorate our space programs**]{.underline}," Ralph said.
"Just like in the 1950s and 60s, [\[Trump\] is using space exploration
to **cultivate nationalist sentiment** and]{.underline} arguably
[**shift questions away** from questions of **social justice** and
questions of **inequality**]{.underline}."

Americas.]{.underline} Starting in the late 1400s, Great Britain, Spain,
and Portugal funded missions to the Americas in order to gather natural
resources that would power up their economies. [By stealing the land
that made this resource extraction possible, colonizers used genocide,
enslavement, biological weaponry, and warfare]{.underline} and that
resulted in the deaths of tens of millions of indigenous people living
in the "New World." [The concept of race, and therefore racism, was
invented as a way of justifying their violence]{.underline}
[and [legitimizing a hierarchy of race-divided
labor](https://books.google.com/books?id=UMMECgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Intimacies+of+Four+Continents&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwin_Pr4l-PcAhXGqlkKHaC6BQoQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=The%20Intimacies%20of%20Four%20Continents&f=false)]{.underline}.
Based off of what we know right now, the Moon and Mars are devoid of
life, so this colonizing language is not actually putting other beings
at risk. But, [there is the risk that the same racist mythology used to
justify violence and inequality on earth]{.underline} --- such as the
use of frontier, "cowboy" mythology to condone and promote the murder
and displacement of indigenous people in the American West --- [will be
used to justify missions to space]{.underline}. In a future where humans
potentially do live on non-earth planets, [that same racist mythology
would carry through to who is allowed to exist on, and benefit from,
extraterrestrial spaces.]{.underline} On Earth, and in the United States
specifically, [the ideal of a merit-based society has been used to
justify race-blind hiring policies that fail to account
for]{.underline}, say, the implicit [bias]{.underline} against black or
Asian-sounding names, or the legacy of segregation, which continues to
make children of color more vulnerable to attending underfunded schools.
[Narratives of "law and order" have also been used to justify racial
profiling]{.underline} and harsher prison sentences for people of color
than for white people who commit the same crimes. [Not nearly enough
work has been done here on Earth to ensure that these structural
inequalities wouldn't carry through]{.underline}. "Those narratives do
carry specific implications about how people living on other worlds
might be structured," Lucianne Walkowicz, the current Chair of
Astrobiology at the Library of Congress, told The Outline. Walkowicz
organized the Decolonizing Mars Conference that took place on June 27 as
well as a public follow-up event planned for September, to discuss how
colonial language is shaping our potential future in space. "[Space is
not just built for nothing, it's built for people." When we think about
humanity's potential to exist on other planets, it's important to
consider who won't have access to space, in part due to a total lack of
concern over these issues by people who are able to access
it.]{.underline} Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos intends to make space a place for
the rich to use for adventure leisure, and SpaceX/Tesla founder Elon
Musk has proposed that a Martian "colony" can save a selection of
humanity from the collapse of civilization in some World War III
scenario. Granted, right now, these are just words from billionaires who
want to excite the public about their business ventures. But they
suggest that [if the economically and socially vulnerable are priced out
of a life-saving journey from Earth, it is a justifiable
loss]{.underline}. "All of these things that are said off the cuff \[by
billionaires\] have some implications that are concrete and count some
people in, and some people out," Walkowicz said. Part of that concern is
fueled by the fact that Cruz and Pence have presented the path to
settling space as one that will be privately funded, but lead by the
U.S. government. In the Destination Mars subcommittee meeting, [Cruz
said,]{.underline} "At the end of the day, [the commercial sector is
going to be able to invest billions]{.underline} more in dollars in
getting this job \[of getting to Mars\] done." In his Thursday remarks
regarding the Space Force, [Pence]{.underline} also
[implied]{.underline} that [celestial territories would be treated as
private property]{.underline} (even though owning private property in
space is explicitly illegal per the Outer Space Treaty, which the U.S.
and dozens of other nations signed in 1967). ["While other nations
increasingly possess the capability to operate in space, not all of them
share our commitment to freedom, to private property, and the rule of
law," Pence said]{.underline}. "So as we continue to carry American
leadership in space, so also will [we carry America's commitment to
freedom into this new frontier." This approach to public-private
partnerships directly mirrors colonist practices.]{.underline} For
instance, the British East India Company violently colonized parts of
India on behalf of the company, but over time, ownership of the stolen
land shifted to Great Britain.

### Link\-\--Ukraine

[The narrative that only white people deserve peace]{.underline} and

US, French and British troops deployed across the continent. [The white
world causes suffering and then says that the people of the global south
are "uncivilized" with no rights that need to be respected.]{.underline}
A Watson Institute of Brown

that [more than 37 million people]{.underline} in North Africa, Western

and its allies]{.underline} since 2001. The [humanitarian disasters
begun years ago are ongoing]{.underline}, as refugees use the
Mediterranean and even the US border with Mexico as points of escape.
[After experiencing wars of aggression these nations are then subjected
to punishment as the United States steals Afghanistan's assets and keeps
Syria under the thumb of Caesar Sanctions.]{.underline} These thefts
cause more suffering and even death as nations are robbed of the ability
to care for their people. Who is civilized and who is not[? Ukraine has
been pushed to the forefront of American thought in order to defend the
imperialist foreign policy which led to the current conflict with
Russia. If the blue eyed nation is suffering it is because of US and
NATO arrogance and aggression]{.underline}. [Ukraine's current situation
is a direct result of the 2014 coup engineered by the US and its EU
partners]{.underline}. An elected president was dispatched and a civil
war began that has killed some 14,000 people. [Ukraine is a US colony
with a puppet government now under military attack]{.underline}.
Ukrainians are themselves refugees as they flee to neighboring Poland,
Romania, Slovakia and other countries. It is [the supposedly advanced,
democratic, and supposedly civilized who have created their
problems.]{.underline} Yet once again [bare faced racism is
evident]{.underline}. [African migrants]{.underline} and students [in
Ukraine were prohibited from boarding trains]{.underline} and buses
[that could take them to safety.]{.underline} A group of [Jamaican

forced to walk 20 kilometers when they were forced off of a bus enroute
to Poland. [Africans and Jamaicans live and study all over the world
because the US and Europe underdeveloped their nations through a variety
of means]{.underline}. Yet [Ukrainians and Poles didn't see people in
need of help. They determined that the non-blondes were not deserving of
assistance]{.underline}. Ironically, it [is the white supremacist
underpinnings of US/NATO foreign policy which has created all of
Ukraine's suffering. The need to dominate, to "contain" Russia and its
ally China is not playing out the way they had hoped but the Ukrainians
be damned]{.underline}. The MinskII agreement which was unanimously
approved in the United Nations Security Council was a roadmap to peace.
Ukraine should be a neutral nation but that is the exact opposite of
what its lords and masters in Washington want. [The good faith
negotiations that could resolve the crisis are a non-starter because
NATO is a very dishonest broker.]{.underline}

## Impact 

### Impact\-\--Existential Threat

#### Treat white supremacy as an [existential threat]{.underline}.

**Preston, 17**---Cass School of Education and Communities, University
of East London (John, "Rethinking Existential Threats and Education,"
Competence Based Education and Training (CBET) and the End of Human
Learning pp 61-93, dml)

After Marxism, [the second existential threat is one of **negation** and
**elimination of the subject**]{.underline} and here I shall consider
conceptions of this from CRT and black existentialism.

Various contemporary educational theories consider the equity and social
justice implications of different forms of education with regard to
race. The work of Sleeter and Grant (2007) makes the ethical and
pragmatic case for multicultural social justice as a key value of
education. This has been followed in contemporary work that attempts to
consider the various dimensions of social justice. For example, Bhopal
and Shain (2014), consider the twin axis of recognition and
redistribution as goals of education. Other work examines the role of
social distancing from the 'Other' by white students as a dynamic
process in which Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) and
working-class students are disadvantaged. In many ways [[denial of
social justice]{.mark} in terms of lack of resources, recognition or
access to social space [can be considered]{.mark}]{.underline} to be [a
form of **dehumanisation**]{.underline}. However, [whilst work on social
justice and education might consider the lack of humanity in these
systems of oppression]{.underline} (applying concepts such as 'bare
life', Lewis 2006; or 'othering' Lebowitz 2016) [they **do not consider
directly [existential threats]{.mark}**[. Threats to humanity]{.mark} on
the basis of difference [may arise]{.mark} from totalitarianism [**as
much as through war** and]{.mark} **threats to the
[environment]{.mark}**. The various genocides which have taken place
throughout human history **have often had a racial**, or **ethnic**,
**cleansing purpose** to them. They have been eugenic threats that are
based upon spurious ideas of genetic and moral superiority. Writers on
race]{.underline} from Fanon to Du Bois [have considered that the threat
posed to racial groups **may be existential** and that [there is a
**short step** from **psychic**, to **real
extermination**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The negation of individuals
through economic, social and psychological processes allows for their
physical extermination. Du Bois (2014) deals explicitly with existential
threat in his short story 'The Comet' where humanity is almost wiped out
by a threat from space, leaving only a small number of people to carry
on. As one of the survivors of the comet is an African American, this
leads Du Bois to consider the state of race relations in the USA. The
implication of the story is that the existential threat of the comet
(which allows the African American character to live in a world entirely
free of racial prejudice) allows release from the existential threat of
eugenic attitudes. Building on Du Bois, in other work (Preston 2012), I
have considered the ways in which [[preparation for]{.underline}]{.mark}
threats, including [**[existential threats]{.mark}** such as
**pandemics** and **nuclear war**, [has been]{.mark} **in many ways
[eugenic]{.mark}** in that [it prioritises]{.mark} the survival of
**[some more than others]{.mark}** based upon]{.underline} criteria
which include [**race** and **ethnicity**]{.underline} (Preston 2012).
[[Preparing]{.mark} for disasters and emergencies often **prioritises
the interests of white people** above those of other ethnic minorities.
One reason for this is **tacit intentionality** which means that
policymakers and practitioners **[do not consider human
diversity]{.mark}** in considering how people may respond to disaster.
Policy is **often biased** as policymakers expect that people **will be
'like me'** which]{.underline} (at least in the UK and USA) [means they
will **often be white**, **middle-class**, **educated**,
**English-speaking men**. In planning for threats, there will be various
ways in which such biases are included]{.underline}. For example, [they
may not consider publishing advice in a number of languages, the
resources necessary to survive a disaster, the mobility of people and
the attitudes of emergency responders. This is **unwitting prejudice**
in that by not considering diversity they are actually **making it less
likely** for BAME people to **survive**, or **protect themselves**
against, the disaster]{.underline}.

Although these biases may lead to a gradient in terms of survival by
different groups in a disaster, they do not appear to relate to
existential threat. However, existential threat can be interpreted in a
different way in perspectives from critical whiteness studies and CRT.

In critical whiteness studies, [whiteness is taken to be not a racial
identity, but rather a **system of power** and
**oppression**]{.underline} (Leonardo 2009). [Whiteness was created as
an identity not simply as a mode of social classification but as a way
of **exploiting** and **controlling others**. There are]{.underline}
obviously [periods in history where this was **objectively the
case**]{.underline}. During slavery in the USA, for example, whiteness
was used as a means to distinguish between those people who had the
right to own property (whites) and those who could not (Africans),
Moreover, whiteness was the obverse of property in that only Africans
could 'be' assets or property. Enslaved Africans were therefore treated
as property and did not have access to the basic rights which would
constitute humanity in American society (such as access to education,
the right to own property, the right to decide who they should have
relationships with). There are obviously parallels between this
experience and holocaust when Jewish people (and other individuals) were
dehumanised by the Nazis and denied access to basic resources. During
imperialism there was also a period whereby [other races were
categorised to be **less worthy** than white people and this **provided
the justification** for **colonial control**, **exploitation** and often
**extermination**.]{.underline}

Advocates of whiteness studies go further than this and consider that
[whiteness is not merely a past system]{.underline} of oppression, [but
a **continuing system** of white supremacy]{.underline} (Leonardo 2009).
The economy and [society is comprised in such a way that **white people
will usually benefit**, and BAME people will **usually not**. This is
not only an economic and social system but also a **psychological
system** whereby existence as a full human **depends upon one's racial
categorisation**]{.underline}. This idea has its roots in the work of
Fanon (1986) who wrote that black identity was shaped by the white gaze,
but also contemporary [writers]{.underline} also con[sider the notion of
**[whiteness as 'death']{.mark}**, a categorisation that is rooted in
**past oppression** and **extermination**, whose remnants **exist to
this day**. This]{.underline} perspective on race and existence [[leads
us to **consider what is meant by life**]{.mark}, and whether we are
**not currently living to our full potential**]{.underline} (as Marxists
would also propose) [when existential threat is **actually amongst
us**]{.underline}. For Marxists this would be the expansion of the
'social universe' of capitalism that flows between and through us,
'capitalising humanity'. For critical whiteness studies, [[this
existential threat would be]{.underline}]{.mark} one of [**whiteness**
and [the **negation of existence** for a racially classified
group]{.mark} of people.]{.underline}

In order to make this idea of constant existential threat more tangible
(although the term is not used) critical race theorists use what are
known as 'counter-stories' to consider how racial dynamics might develop
in the future, or to highlight inequalities in the present (Delgado
1996). Derrick Bell (1992) who is considered to be the founder of CRT,
uses a much cited counter-story 'The Space Traders' to consider the ways
in which black people's lives are classed as being not equal to those of
whites in the USA. In 'The Space Traders' a race of aliens offer the USA
a trade: all of America's black citizens in return for unlimited,
environmentally friendly, energy and technology. After some debate, the
American people vote on the proposal and decide to give up all of
America's black citizens to the space traders in return for the
futuristic technical goods. Of course, Bell is proposing an analogy
between slavery in the past and the present situation of black people in
the USA, and perhaps even suggesting that such a thing might happen
again. On another level, though, there is also the idea that [the
existence of black people in America is [**categorised at a different
level** of]{.mark} metaphysical [worth]{.mark} to that of white people.
That life could be **traded so cheaply**, even
**plausibly**]{.underline} (in the thought experiment) [[makes us
**pause**]{.mark} **for thought** [in]{.mark} terms of **[how we
classify existential threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Although the relationship between CRT and black existentialism may not
always seem obvious we can see that there is a nihilistic streak in the
work of Bell (1992) with regard to the prospects for survival. In
addition, the drawing on the work of Fanon by authors who use CRT as
part of their work which shows the perpetual violence encountered by
people of colour in education as well as the enduring influence of Du
Bois on CRT (Delgado and Stefancic 2001) shows the close connection
between the two theories. [What links CRT and black existentialism is a
**basic concern with existence** and the **meaning of human life under
constant threat** that can be thought to underpin any concern with
social justice]{.underline}. From CRT and black existentialism, we
therefore see that [**existential threat is one of negation** through
**economic**, **social** and **political systems** and there are
**degrees of graduation** between these forms of existential threats and
**actual genocide** or **extermination**]{.underline}. The links between
these points and CBET might be considered as obtuse but, as we shall see
in the next chapter, [systems of education can play a role in forms of
negation]{.underline}. Obviously, [there are **social justice
implications** in the way in which people are treated in terms of race
and ethnicity in education]{.underline}. The 'triaging' by race and
ethnicity of access to education courses, the ways in which certain
groups are rationed access to educational routes and the fragility of
links between education and the labour market for BAME groups are all
part of marginalisation, in which vocational education plays a large
part. As part of this process, and probably not coincidentally, these
groups are also more likely to find themselves in vocational, CBET
courses. However, social justice is not the whole story, and there is a
more profound form of equality associated with the right to existence.
It is this that CBET threatens through the reduction of the subject to a
digital organism as I will show in the next chapter.

#### Don't even let them into the house.

University of Paris, Naiteire, Racism, Translated by Steve Martinot, pg.

[[The struggle against racism will be]{.mark} **long, difficult,
[without intermission]{.mark}**]{.underline}, without remission,
probably never achieved.  Yet [for this very reason, it is **a struggle
to be undertaken [without]{.mark}**]{.underline} surcease and without
**[[concessions]{.underline}]{.mark}.**  [[One cannot be indulgent
toward racism]{.mark}.  [One **cannot even let the monster in the
house**, especially]{.mark} **not [in a mask]{.mark}**.  To give it
merely a foothold means to augment the bestial part in us and in other
people, which is to diminish what is human.  [To accept the racist
universe to the slightest degree is to **endorse fear,
injustice**]{.mark}**, and [violence]{.mark}.**]{.underline}   It is to
accept the persistence of the dark history in which we still largely
live. It is to agree that the outsider will always be a possible victim
(and which \[person\] man is not \[themself\] himself an outsider
relative to someone else?). Racism illustrates in sum, the inevitable
negativity of the  condition of the dominated;  that is it illuminates
in a certain sense the entire human condition[. The anti-racist
struggle, difficult though it is. and always in question, is
nevertheless one of the prologues to the ultimate passage from animality
to humanity]{.underline}. In that sense, [**we cannot fail to rise to
the racist challenge**.]{.underline} However, it remains true that
one\'s moral conduct only emerges from a choice: one has to want it. It
is a choice among other choices, and always debatable in its foundations
and its consequences.  Let us say, broadly speaking, that the choice to
conduct oneself morally is the condition for the establishment of a
human order for which racism is  the very negation.  This is almost a
redundancy.  [[One cannot found a moral]{.mark} order,
[let alone]{.mark} **a [legislative order]{.mark}**[, on racism]{.mark}
because [racism signifies]{.mark} **the [exclusion of the other]{.mark}
and his or her [subjection to violence and
domination]{.mark}.**]{.underline} From an ethical point of view, if one
can deploy a little religious language, racism is \"the truly capital
sin.\"fn22 It is not an accident that almost all of humanity\'s
spiritual traditions counsel respect for the weak, for orphans, widows,
or strangers. It is not just a question of theoretical counsel respect
for the weak, for orphans, widows, or strangers. It is not just a
question of theoretical morality and disinterested commandments. Such
unanimity in the safeguarding of the other suggests the real utility of
such sentiments. All things considered, we have an interest in banishing
injustice, because injustice engenders violence and death Of course,
this is debatable. There are those who think that if one is strong
enough, the assault on and oppression of others is permissible. But no
one is ever sure of remaining the strongest. One day, perhaps, the roles
will be reversed, All unjust society contains within itself the seeds of
its own death. It is probably smarter to treat others with respect so
that they treat you with respect. \"Recall,\" says the Bible, \"that you
were once a stranger in Egypt,\" which means both that you ought to
respect the stranger because you were a stranger yourself and that you
risk becoming once again someday[. **It is an ethical and a practical
appeal**]{.underline} \-- indeed, it is a contract, however implicit it
might be. In short, [[the refusal of racism is the condition for all
theoretical]{.mark} and practical [morality]{.mark}. Because, in the
end. [The ethical choice commands the political choic]{.mark}e. A just
society must be a society accepted by all. If this contractual principle
is not accepted, then only conflict, violence, and destruction will be
our lot.  **If it is accepted, we can hope**]{.underline} someday **[to
live in peace]{.underline}**.  True, [it is a wager, but **the stakes
are irresistible**.]{.underline}

### Impact\-\--Racial Hierarchy 

#### IR is [utilized]{.underline} to establish a system of [racial logics]{.underline} that [overcodes]{.underline} the globe

**Lake et al. 21**(David, Distinguished Professor of Political Science
at the University of California, San Diego, Bianca Freedman, PhD
candidate in the Department of Political Science at UC San Diego, D.G.
Kim, Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at the
University of California, San Diego, "Race in International Relations:
Beyond the "Norm Against Noticing"", CS)

As the Howard School knew, race is a social construct that categorizes
or classifies humans ac-cording to contrived differences. Its
categories---races---are always and everywhere contested, a product of
social struggle. As such[, race is nearly always vertically stratified,
entitling members of the ranked categories different rights and
privileges within society. Omi & Winant]{.underline} (1994, p.
60)[center this idea of racial hierarchy in their theory of racial
formation]{.underline}. They explain that [hierarchy is established and
sustained as a racial project such that "everybody learns\...the rules
of racial classification and of her racial identity\...inserted in a
comprehensively racialized social structure. Race becomes 'common
sense'---a way of comprehending, explaining, and acting in the
world.]{.underline}" As Bonilla-Silva (1997) suggests,
[racialization]{.underline}---the process by which groups are attributed
racial meaning---[conditions how actors relate to the social structures
and institutional systems they in-habit]{.underline}. As an organizing
principle of super- and subordination, it orders [race hierarchically
and engenders behaviors and interests to fit the position of the groups
in the racial regime.]{.underline} Fanon \[2008 (1952)\] perceived
racial hierarchy and the process of racialization in the language of
colonial domination. [To internalize the norms of the colonizer was to
participate in one's own oppression, to reflect the very hierarchical
structures of alienation. Once racial stratification is established and
its "racial logics" are absorbed]{.underline} (Hobson & Sharman 2005),
[race becomes an in-dependent criterion for vertical hierarchy in a
society, both domestic and international.]{.underline} And to be sure,
[race as a hierarchy is international]{.underline}. Wynter (2003) argues
that [a globally expanding West used race to define and order the
human]{.underline}. The color line encoded deserving and undeserving
status within Western imperial orders. [Racial hierarchy becomes
important in IR in at least two fundamental ways]{.underline}, explored
in more detail below. Though the coin may eventually be revealed as
multisided, we see perceived deficiency and hostility as the two faces
of racism in world politics. [In the first face, countries below the
color line are perceived to be deficient in some essential
attribute]{.underline}. Through the mid-twentieth century, this face of
racism was manifested in the "standard of civilization" criteria for
establishing sovereignty and acceptance into the family of nations. [As
the norm of juridical sovereignty took hold after the formation of the
United Nations, conferring sovereignty on any recognized member of the
international community regardless of their capacity to govern their
territory effectively]{.underline} ( Jackson 1990), [the same projection
of deficiency onto countries with majorities of people of color
continued in the practice and interpretation of international
law]{.underline}. [In the second face, non-White-majority countries are
perceived by White-majority countries to be inherently aggressive or
threatening.]{.underline} [Within a racialized global order, dominant
actors perceive racially "inferior" foreign countries as potentially
destabilizing to the status quo]{.underline}. This is precisely how Du
Bois \[2005(1906), p. 34\] construed the problem of the color line: [the
prospect of war and peace hinges upon how White-majority countries cope
with perceived challenges from the "awakening of the brown and black
races."]{.underline} The integrated analytic framework in Figure 1
illustrates the intersections of racial hierarchy, international law,
and foreign policy. First, [norms, including the norm of racial
hierarchy, are so deeply woven into the fabric of social life that they
appear natural, effectively conditioning the design and enforcement of
an international legal order]{.underline} (i). Once [the embedded social
norm]{.underline}(in this case, the norm of racial hierarchy[) is
codified, international law further authorizes and promotes
it]{.underline} (ii), which is often the intended goal of norms
entrepreneurs in international politics In other words, international
law, racialized in its content and enforcement, helps consolidate what
Reus-Smit (2017, p. 875) calls the "authorized forms of difference"
along the color line. As discussed in more detail below, [uneven
application of law brace plagues international politics. Providing rules
that order relations between states with different status, rights, and
responsibilities, international law thus guides the practice of foreign
policy making]{.underline} (Figure 1, iii), [which in turn reproduces an
unequal global order that is underwritten by the international legal
system as well as the racial hierarchy embedded within it]{.underline}
(iv). Racial hierarchy also implicates foreign policy and practice more
directly. [The racial norm shapes foreign policies by conditioning how
actors perceive their interests, interpret the position and interests of
racial others, and act accordingly.]{.underline} As emphasized by
Jackson (2006, p. 16), [racial hierarchy affects foreign policy making
through the process of legitimation, defined as "the process of drawing
and (re)establishing boundaries]{.underline}, ruling some courses of
action acceptable and others unacceptable." By supplying the language of
legitimation that shapes predominant foreign policy discourses, racial
hierarchy thus renders certain foreign policies acceptable and therefore
possible (Figure 1, v[). Similar to how international law facilitates
the authorization of racial hierarchy (ii), foreign policy and practice
in turn further reinforce the norm of racial hierarchy, reifying the
contrived racial categories and differences]{.underline} (vi). Below, we
provide a more in-depth discussion on how racial hierarchy shapes the
formulation of foreign policy[. Altogether, the interactions of racial
hierarchy, international law, and foreign policy reaffirm one another
and produce a racialized world that is taken for granted.]{.underline}

### AT: Empirics

#### [Modern IR]{.underline} frameworks selectively employ [willful amnesia]{.underline} to justify their methodology -- their theories aren't supported by [empirics]{.underline} by rather by the [blatant omission]{.underline} of them

Race Matters in International Relations", CS)

Take [the "big three" IR paradigms: realism, liberalism, and
constructivism.]{.underline} These dominant frames for understanding
global politics [are built on raced and racist intellectual foundations
that limit the field's ability to answer important questions about
international security and organization]{.underline}. [Core
concepts,]{.underline} like anarchy and hierarchy, are raced: They [are
rooted in discourses that center and favor Europe and the
West.]{.underline} These concepts implicitly [and explicitly pit
"developed" against "undeveloped," "modern" against
"primitive,"]{.underline} "civilized" against "uncivilized." And [their
use is racist: These invented binaries are used to explain subjugation
and exploitation around the globe]{.underline} [While realism and
liberalism were built on Eurocentrism and used to justify white
imperialism]{.underline}, this fact is not widely acknowledged in the
field. For instance, [according to neorealists, there exists a "balance
of power" between and among "great powers.]{.underline}" Most of these
great powers are, not incidentally, [white-majority states, and they sit
atop the hierarchy, with small and notably less-white powers organized
below them.]{.underline} In a similar vein, [raced hierarchies and
conceptions of control ground the concept of cooperation in neoliberal
thought]{.underline}: Major powers own the proverbial table, set the
chairs, and arrange the place settings. [Constructivism,]{.underline}
which rounds out the "big three" approaches, is perhaps best positioned
to tackle race and racism. Constructivists reject the as-given condition
of anarchy and maintain that anarchy, security, and other concerns are
socially constructed based on shared ideas, histories, and experiences.
Yet with few notable exceptions, constructivists [rarely acknowledge how
race shapes what is shared. Despite the dominance of the "big
three"]{.underline} in the modern study of IR, many of [the arguments
they advance, such as the balance of power, are not actually supported
by evidence outside of modern Europe.]{.underline} Consider [the
democratic peace theory]{.underline}. The theory [makes]{.underline} two
[key propositions: that democracies are less likely to go to war than
are nondemocracies,]{.underline} and that democracies are less likely to
go to war with each other. The historical record shows that [democracies
have actually not been less likely to fight wars---if you include their
colonial conquests]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [in regions such as the
Middle East and North Africa, democratizing states have experienced more
internal conflicts than their less-democratic peers.]{.underline} Yet
[leaders in the West have invoked democratic peace theory to justify
invading and occupying less-democratic, and notably less-white,
countries]{.underline}. This is a key element of IR's racial exclusion:
The state system that IR seeks to explain arises from the 1648 Peace of
Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years' War and established European
principles of statehood and sovereignty. Far from 17th-century relics,
these principles are enshrined in the United Nations Charter---the
foundation for global governance since 1945. But [non-European nations
did not voluntarily adopt European understandings of
statehood]{.underline} and sovereignty, as IR scholars often
mythologize. Instead, [Europe, justified by Westphalia, divided the
world between the modern, "civilized" states and conquered those which
they did not think belonged in the international system]{.underline}. IR
scholar Sankaran Krishna has argued that[, because IR privileges
theorizing over historical description and analysis, the field enables
this kind of whitewashing. Western concepts are prioritized at the
expense of their applicability in the world]{.underline}. Krishna called
this "[a systematic politics of forgetting, a willful amnesia, on the
question of race."]{.underline}

### AT: Not the Root Cause

#### IR is rooted in racism and eurocentrism

Beyond the "Norm Against Noticing"", CS)

In a parallel fashion, as suggested above, [race is hidden behind
international law and the principle of sovereign equality.]{.underline}
Rooted in conceptions of natural law, international law is necessarily
universal and based on principles of equality. Yet, [race was implicated
in the development of international law almost from its very
origins]{.underline} (see, e.g., Pitts 2018). [The vision of equality at
its core was immediately challenged by Europe's encounter with the rest
of the world]{.underline} during the age of discovery. [If international
law applied universally to peoples]{.underline}, their territory, and
their existing governance structures, [then Europeans would have to
recognize these unfamiliar polities as equal to their own, which in turn
would have prevented them from expropriating the land and enslaving
those who lived on it.]{.underline} To justify expropriation,
[international law thus required the creation or application of
racialized hierarchies that considered non-European societies as less
than human.]{.underline} [The interpretation of race as a stable,
self-evident difference became the marker from which more elaborate
notions of difference, like "civilization," were
constructed]{.underline} (Anghie 2006). In one such justification, John
Locke declared the territory occupied by Indigenous peoples in the
Americas as forfeit for their failure to enclose and cultivate the land
(see Arneil 1996). In short, [international law required Europeans to
assign a lesser status to others in order to reconcile the conception of
equality under the law that governed their own relations with the desire
to exploit the "new worlds" they "discovered."]{.underline} Thus, [race
was tethered to the rationale for conquest undertaken by European
powers]{.underline}. Race continued to animate international law and
relations between Europe and the rest of the world well into the
twentieth century. In negotiations over the League of Nations in 1919,
for instance, [Japan's proposed language on racial equality was
rejected]{.underline}. Although it received broad support, US President
Woodrow Wilson, who himself had resegregated the US civil service, was
in the Chair and summarily declared that such an important change
required unanimity, which effectively killed the proposal. [Following
World War II, renewed calls for formal racial equality]{.underline} at
the San Francisco Conference in 1945 and later the International
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in
[1969 led to the prohibition of racism, but subtly embedded it in the
precept of sovereignty and the corresponding doctrine of domestic
jurisdiction that allowed member countries to prohibit international
oversight of their domestic racial regimes]{.underline}(Búzás 2021). As
a shield against foreign interference[, sovereignty became a way of
preserving racial inequality at home.]{.underline} Its universal
standard also [gave rise to]{.underline} [an international legal order
that obscured racism from view.]{.underline} By the mid-twentieth
century, non-European societies acquired the status of sovereign
state-hood previously denied by international law. On its face,
decolonization overcame the notion that racial others were somehow not
ready for full sovereignty (Grovogui 1996). In practice, however,
[writing race out of law was necessary to conceal, and therefore
maintain, the uneven application of international norms and rules along
constructed racial difference]{.underline}. By implication, formal
manifestations of race are no longer permissible. But at the same time[,
the projection of racial deficiency by White-majority countries onto
especially Black-majority states is found in the practice and
interpretation of contemporary international law]{.underline}. Although
engagement varies across the movement of critical race theories and
Third World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL), [much of the work
within these reconstructive traditions has sought to uncover the ongoing
dynamics of racialized power that constitute international law and
relations]{.underline}. The racialization of international law can be
seen in several contemporary legal [and political trends]{.underline}
that [are]{.underline} at least implicitly premised on [a conception of
non-White-majority countries as being deficient and in need of
assistance or corrective action by North American or European
states]{.underline}

### AT: Our Threats are Real

#### Western epistemology will always present itself as [indisputably true]{.underline}\-\--[subjecting]{.underline} the rest of the world to [disempowerment]{.underline} and [objectification]{.underline}

**Van Milders and Toros 20**(Lucas, Assistant Professor in Critical
Security Studies at the University of Groningen, Harmonie, Deputy
Director of Institute of Cyber Security for Society (iCSS) at University
of Kent, "Violent International Relations", CS)

We advance here a two-pronged conception of disciplinary violence. On
the one hand, as is argued in this section, [the epistemic violence of
colonial disciplinarity shuts down debate and critique and leaves
unhindered violent regimes of governmentality.]{.underline} On the other
hand, as it will be argued in the next section, [this form of violence
is epitomised in the international expert.]{.underline} [What moulds
this all together is]{.underline}, apart from disciplinary fragmentation
and hierarchy, [the insulation of rational, objective and universal
knowledge]{.underline} (typically associated with Western epistemology)
[from irrational, subjective and particular knowledge]{.underline}
(although it is commonly referred to as experience or a perspective as
opposed to knowledge). What t[his concerns is a colonial matrix of power
that is based on a racist classification of the world]{.underline}
(Quijano, 2007: 171). This is indeed one, as Kerem Nisancioglu argues in
this issue, [that still affects IR's racialised account of one of its
key elements of analysis]{.underline}: sovereignty (2020). The colonial
infrastructure of knowledge production is thus part of a much broader
matrix of colonial hierarchies that were imposed through European
imperialism since 1492. This involved, among others, a racist hierarchy
that privileged European whiteness and a sexist hierarchy that
privileged the European masculinity (Grosfoguel, 2009). Indeed, [the
colonial framework is deeply racist and gendered]{.underline}, and we
understand it as such in this article[. It also includes a global
epistemic hierarchy that privileges the Western mode of knowledge
production as the only viable way of producing knowledge that is
universal, objective, neutral and scientific.]{.underline} As mentioned
above, this concerns ideas about organising, classifying and storing
knowledge, yet it is [specifically by hiding its locus of enunciation
that its claims towards universality are facilitated.]{.underline}
Indeed, similar to decadent disciplines, [Western epistemology presents
itself as coinciding with universality and is therefore capable of
generating absolute knowledge by subjugating other modes of knowledge
production]{.underline} as particular, subjective, biased and
un-scientific[. This epistemic subsequently operates through binary
conceptions such as the West and the Rest that, on the one hand,
consolidate a position of imperial hegemony while, on the other, cement
other perspectives, knowledges and experiences into a subjugated
position]{.underline} (Hall, 1996). [The result of this is]{.underline},
in the words of Frantz Fanon[, a dividing of the world in a zone of
being and zone of nonbeing]{.underline}. For if it is only the Western
mode of knowledge production that is capable of generating universal
knowledge, then [this means that the Western experience itself
necessarily corresponds to the experience of humanity as
such]{.underline}. [Everything else is not a different type of
knowledge]{.underline} -- since this would affect the appeal to
universality that marks Western epistemology -- [but is simply
non-existent.]{.underline} [What separates the zone of nonbeing from the
zone of being is an unsurmountable line that strips the non-Western
other of their ontological resistance.]{.underline} In the zone of
nonbeing, [colonial racialisation inescapably subjects one to
disempowerment and objectification]{.underline}. For Fanon, the reasons
behind this are plain and simple: 'The white man wants the world; he
wants it for himself alone. He finds himself predestined master of this
world. He enslaves it. An acquisitive relation is established between
the world and him' (Fanon, 2008: 97).

### AT: Liberalism Good

#### Liberal peace is inseparable from the [violent façade of liberal pacification]{.underline} which obscures the [escalating cycle]{.underline} of phenomenological violence at the [heart]{.underline} of the world order that kills [value to life]{.underline} and ensures [nuclear war]{.underline}

[Phenomenology]{.underline}, as we are using it, [is **not about lived
experience**]{.underline}. [It is the]{.underline} philosophical
[tradition of **revealing different types of beings** and **things**
that contain meaning in our world, the **structures** and/or
**contexts** in which they exist, and how these structures and contexts
are **meaningful**]{.underline}. Understood in this way, [**violence**
is one of these structures and/or contexts]{.underline}. A
phenomenological perspective does not approach violence from a
particular normative position, although it does not preclude normative
critique. [A phenomenological approach **does not treat violence as a
discrete thing** that one agent does to another]{.underline}, although
it does not preclude such acts being described as violent. Instead, [a
phenomenological perspective **adds to our intellectual** and
**methodological toolbox** by identifying violence as a **condition** or
**context** in which people function. Phenomenology allows us to
identify violence occurring in ways and in places that we **otherwise
would not be able to recognize**]{.underline}. It does not change the
meaning of violence (as harm, for example). Instead, [it treats violence
**ontologically**, enabling us to **reveal more accurately** the extent
to which violence exists in the world]{.underline}.

[From a phenomenological perspective, violence is **often
inconspicuous**. Violence can function as a **naturalized** or
**internalized regime of compulsion** or **domination**.
**Pacification** reveals both the **pervasiveness of violence** and
**forms of violence that may otherwise remain inconspicuous**. The
**erasing of tradition** and the **enforcement of particular legal
codes** at the expense of **indigenous cultural norms** is one example
of an **inconspicuous form** of violence]{.underline} that involves
conspicuous and inconspicous consequences (Cocks 2014). [In
understanding violence **phenomenologically**]{.underline}, as a
structure of revealing across multiple worlds, [we are **better able to
reveal the extent** to which violence **shapes our world** and how we
are then **shaped by violence**]{.underline}.

Pacavere

The Romans understood violence as a necessary condition for pax. [The
liberal imagination]{.underline} blinds itself to [\[**obfuscates**\]
the ways that pacification **functions as violence** in our world order.
**I**]{.underline}nternational **[r]{.underline}**elations
scholarship['s]{.underline} [**strict distinction** between peace and
violence **reinforces this obfuscation**. Yet, the **violence of** (and
**in**) **pacification is central to the contemporary
world**.]{.underline} A phenomenological approach shows that [moments of
violent rupture are **not aberrations** of the world order. Violent
outbreaks are **breakdowns of pacification**]{.underline}. It follows
that [multiple structures of the world order function as the violence of
pacification]{.underline}, of pacavere.12 [These structures include
**liberal capitalism**, **colonialism** and the **postcolonial
aftermath**, and **war**]{.underline}. Each functions as a key site of
pacification. Anarchist thought reveals the pacification in liberal
capitalism. Postcolonial thought reveals the pacification of colonial
projects. Both anarchist and postcolonial thought demonstrate how war is
a breakdown of pacification, revealing the hidden violent structures of
our worldhood.

Anarchist critiques of capitalism, unlike Marxist and liberal
interpretations, take seriously the decisive role of state violence in
structuring society and markets. Anarchists view [the
**state**]{.underline} as an institution that [**sustains elite
appropriations** of political and economic power]{.underline} (Proudhon
\[1861\] 1998; Sorel 1999; Prichard 2015). [Those at the bottom of the
social hierarchy **bear the costs** of this enforced order. The state
**diffuses violence** (pacification) throughout the entire
society---often in ways that **go unrecognized** by its
subjects]{.underline} (Sorel 1999, 65). [The naturalization of violence
**consolidates arbitrary regimes of domination** in society. While
**specific**, **countable incidents** of violence **may decline**, the
social order is **largely premised** on the **threat of violence** for
contravening social norms making specific, countable incidents of
violence **relatively rare**]{.underline} (Kinna and Prichard,
forthcoming).

[Anarchist thinkers view **rising inequality** in the context of
**declining riots**, **insurgencies**, and
**assassinations**]{.underline} (see Figure 1) [as **evidence of
pacification**. Incidents of proletarian violence, anticolonial
violence, riots, and protests are all examples of resistance to the
"regimes of domination" that shape contemporary society]{.underline},
regimes easily identifiable by those subject to them (Gordon 2007, 33).
Drawing on these accounts, [we interpret declining rates of riots as a
sign of **increased pacification**, **rather than evidence** that the
system is **becoming less violent**]{.underline}. Conversely, eruptions
of antistate and anticapitalist direct violence are signs of a breakdown
in pacification. Much like Heidegger's example of broken equipment
(1962, 102--3, 412--13), which draws our attention to the background
structures of our world, brief instances of direct violence reveal
violently structured social relations.

[Although the liberal imagination **obscures the centrality of
violence**, violence **has always been central** to the liberal world
order]{.underline}---to the liberal worldhood---[particularly during the
**colonial** and **imperial projects**]{.underline} of the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries (Bell 2007a, 2007b). [Colonial violence was
**diffused throughout the entire society**, often in ways that **went
unrecognized** by the colonized themselves. The violence of pacification
**structured the very existence** of the colonized subject]{.underline}.
This violence transformed the colonized subjects into a different
"species" (Fanon 1963, 35-- 40, 43). [Colonial pacification was **more
than direct** and **indirect violence**; it was sufficiently diffuse to
**remake the psyche** of the colonized, **affecting their mental
health** and **emotions**]{.underline} (Fanon 1963, 35--106).
[Fanon]{.underline} (1963, 31) [described it as "**atmospheric
violence**," a "violence **rippling under the skin**." Unable to lash
out against the colonizer, the colonized lived everyday within a world
ordered by violence]{.underline}. In this world, the colonized could not
respond to the colonizers for fear of directly violent reprisals and
would turn to symbolic activities such as a dance circle to expose the
violence experienced on a daily basis (Fanon 1963, 57). For the
colonized, rituals such as the dance were a means of expressing
existential frustrations with and resistance to the violence of colonial
pacification through reenactments of direct violence. Ultimately,
anticolonial struggles exposed the violence of colonialism by directing
that violence back on its authors.

Practices of colonial rule were central to developing liberal norms of
sovereignty, as well as to the domination and control of recalcitrant
populations whether within Europe, such as the English domination of the
Welsh, Irish, and Scots, or outside of Europe by settler colonialists
against indigenous populations (Deloria Jr 1974; Anghie 2005; Miller
2006; Havercroft 2008; Shaw 2008; Barkawi and Stanski 2012; Coulthard
2014; Simpson 2014; Lightfoot 2016; Rueda-Saiz 2017). [This civilizing
imagination **functioned phenomenologically**. It produced insiders as
**civilized** and **peaceful** and outsiders as **violent**, **external
threats** to civilization. In doing so, this imagination **successfully
obscured**]{.underline} how the structures of liberalism produced
colonial violence.**[13]{.underline}**

**[FOOTNOTE 13]{.underline}** Arguments about [the **foundational role
of colonialism**, **primitive accumulation**, and **white supremacy** in
structuring the modern international system]{.underline} are
particularly useful in thinking about phenomenological violence (Jones
2006; Anievas, Manchanda, and Shilliam 2015; Du Bois 1915; Shaw 2008;
Coulthard 2014; Deloria 1974; Lowe 2015; Hartman 1997). [The legacy of
these practices **pervades contemporary liberal
peace-building**]{.underline} (Richmond 2014; Sabaratnam 2015; Bouka
2013; Autesserre 2009) [and **liberal global governance**]{.underline}
(Koomen 2014a, 2014b, 2013), [while trade liberalization can
**facilitate mass violence**]{.underline} (Kamola 2007; Smith 2016).
Césaire argues that [colonialism produced a "**boomerang effect**"
within European societies; **Nazism** was the return of violence
previously "**applied only to non-European peoples**"]{.underline}
(Césaire 2000, 36). At independence, [**international law became a
mechanism** for reinforcing this international order upon the previously
colonized world]{.underline} (Grovogui 1996).

[The idea of war as an **external practice** of states, **not tied** to
their **internal workings** and located according to **specific
normative projections** of Western identity, **followed** from this
colonial mentality. This mentality **legitimized the exporting of
violence** to create a **Western imperial pax** and was so widespread
that it **shaped the development of modern warfare**]{.underline} (Ellis
1986; Proudhon \[1861\] 1998). [The colonial wars **reproduced** and
**reinforced ideologies of Western superiority**, evidenced in part by
the West's **superior military technology**. A consequence of this
racist hubris was the **inability to foresee the destructive
tendencies** of Western warfare when **unleashed against
themselves**]{.underline} (Ellis 1986).

The discipline of international relations, founded in response to the
unexpectedly destructive character of the First World War, reproduced
this understanding of war.14 [This understanding **disguises the
possibility of increasing violence** within the liberal world by
**presuming a historical narrative of progress** and **being shocked by
its aberration**. War, however, is **not the absence of peace** or an
**aberration of liberal progress**, but is instead a **phenomenological
breaking** of the liberal worldhood.]{.underline}15

[Once a liberal order]{.underline} of democracy, free markets, [and
international institutions are **spread throughout the world**, liberal
ideology imagines peace as the end state. Yet, states **often deploy war
under liberal guises**]{.underline}.16 [Wars under the aegis of
humanitarian values and regime change are examples of the multifaceted
character of liberal pacification. Liberal regimes emphasize the
violence of those that they are invading, while minimizing the violence
involved in these military undertakings and the violence necessary to
sustain the liberal societies themselves]{.underline}. What
Pierre-Joseph Proudhon called ["the **moral phenomenology of
war**"]{.underline} (Prichard 2015, 112--34; Proudhon \[1861\] 1998)
[becomes an **integral part** of the **everyday workings of society**
that shape **innumerable aspects** of our daily language]{.underline}.
The upshot is that, [within liberal ideology, the violence committed by
liberal states is justified, whereas the violence committed by illiberal
states is not]{.underline}.

Postcolonial and anarchist scholarship focuses on the incorporation of
violence in the production of liberal spaces (Barkawi and Laffey 1999).
These same concerns can be directed onto the liberal order itself. [Seen
from the perspective of **marginalized** and **oppressed populations**,
the structures of liberal pacification take on a **distinctly violent
aspect**. The liberal world is **not less violent**. Rather, the liberal
world involves a **sophisticated phenomenological process** of
**legitimating certain types of violence** in order to **render other
types of violence invisible**]{.underline}.

Liberal Pacification

What does it mean to apply this third type of violence to our
understanding of international relations? Pacification reveals
liberalism as a violent process as opposed to a system that is
emblematic of the absence of direct violence. There are parallels
between the Pax Britannia, Pax Americana, and the ancient peace of the
Pax Romana (Neocleous 2010, 13). However, our account emphasizes the
crucial role of pacification as a distinct kind of violence in
maintaining these pacific orders. Our theory offers the novel insight
that incorporating pacification into the analysis of the liberal peace
reveals crucial aspects of this peace that conventional and critical
accounts neglect.

A focus on pacification provides three critical insights. First, it
recovers the crucial role of pacification in the historical founding of
the liberal order. Second, by distinguishing between three kinds of
violence (Figure 2), we account for the empirical observations of the
liberal peace as leading to a decline in direct violence and an increase
in violence overall as part of the pacification of the Pax Americana.
Conversely, the liberal version of the Pax Americana cannot account for
key anomalies. Third, our approach draws attention to the violent
ordering of social relations. This dimension of violence is neglected
even in Marxist, postcolonial, neo-Gramscian, and post-structuralist
critiques of the liberal peace, which primarily focus on the role of
direct and indirect violence in maintaining the Pax Americana.

Contemporary liberal international relations theory emphasizes the
nonviolent role of the liberal triad (democracy, free markets, and
institutions) in causing the liberal peace. Yet, a quick review of the
history of liberalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries shows
that key figures in liberalism, from John Stuart Mill, to Joseph
Galliéni, to American foreign policy elites, understood pacification as
a necessary step in establishing and maintaining the liberal order

Mill, one of the philosophical founders of liberalism, conceptualized
and deployed liberalism as a domination strategy. Mill argued that it is
appropriate to impose despotism or slavery on "savages" who incline to
"fighting and rapine," but the government should use force as little as
possible:

What they require is not a government of force, but one of guidance.
Being, however, in too low a state to yield to the guidance of any but
those to whom they look up as the possessors of force, the sort of
government fittest for them is one \[that\] possesses force, but seldom
uses it. (Mill 1998, 232--33)

In terms of our conceptual distinction, Mill argued that liberalism as
pacification was a more effective instrument of violence than the direct
modes of violence that governments usually deploy.

The history of European colonialism is replete with this line of
reasoning. "\[L\]iberal improvement" was a regular plank of colonial
strategy by France and Britain in the nineteenth century (Owens 2015,
154). Consider one example from the French colonial tradition. Galliéni,
a military commander and administrator, consciously deployed liberalism
as a domination strategy in the pacification of Tonkin during the 1890s.
Galliéni's strategy involved slowly spreading military outposts and
deploying civil administrators to create markets, schools, and
amenities. The rationale was that locals would gain a personal interest
in the continuation of French control and would help to quell Chinese
brigandage. "Piracy," said Galliéni, "is the result of an economic
condition. It can be fought by prosperity" (quoted in Owens 2015, 157).
Galliéni devised a "theory of pacification" in which "the correct
combination of force and politics can socialize, pacify, and domesticate
a population into regulating itself" (quoted in Owens 2015, 157). What
Mill proposed in theory, Galliéni enacted in practice;
pacification---the violent reordering of social relations in a
colony---was a more effective means of maintaining liberal rule than the
deployment of direct violence.

[While less explicit, the relationship between liberalism and
imperialism **remained present**]{.underline} in the twentieth-century
development of the Pax Americana. During this era, US policy makers
sought to construct a zone of peace distinct from the zones of war
associated with authoritarian regimes. The US State Department first
recognized the concept of "hegemonic pacification" in the Euro-Atlantic
conference diplomacy of the 1920s (Cohrs 2008, 619). [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' ["**strategic
restraint**"]{.underline} in the aftermath of World War Two [was
motivated by this concept of **liberal**, **hegemonic
pacification**]{.underline} (Ikenberry 2009; Ikenberry 2011, 173). US
defense officials Stimson, Patterson, McCloy, and Assistant Secretary
Howard C. Peterson agreed that it was a matter of the security interests
of the United States to maintain "open markets, unhindered access to raw
materials, and the rehabilitation of much---if not all---of Eurasia
along liberal capitalist lines" (Leffler 1984, 349--56; Barkawi and
Laffey 1999). Liberalism as a domination and pacifying strategy
continued throughout (and long after) the Cold War (Laffey 2003; Stokes
2003), as evident in one of the founding documents of the post--World
War Two liberal order, NSC-68 (Ikenberry 2011, 168). [While the
enforcement of a Pax Americana **eventually yielded a decline** in
direct violence, it **produced an increase** in other types of
violence]{.underline}. The first insight of our theory is that
[pacification **has always been part of the liberal project**
and]{.underline} that [the violence in the liberal project **never went
away**]{.underline}.

The second insight is that [by reinterpreting the liberal peace as
liberal pacification we are able to **grant the empirical findings** of
liberal peace theorists while **maintaining** that the Pax Americana
represents an **intensification of violence overall**]{.underline}.
[In]{.underline} the language of [**positivist social science**, our
theory is **observationally equivalent** to that of liberal peace
theory]{.underline}. We expect that [the quantity of direct violence
**inversely associates** with the degree of pacification in a
society]{.underline}. Therefore, [our interpretation **challenges
research** that identifies liberal institutions as the cause of
declining violence. Liberal institutions, as apparatuses of liberal
pacification, ensure that direct violence is increasingly rare while
**leaving the structures of violence** and **domination in
place**]{.underline}. The observational equivalence on particular
dependent variables (in our case, all forms of direct violence) produces
a theoretical change requiring the generation of novel observable
implications (King, Keohane, and Verba 1994, 30).

Furthermore, [**increased suffering** in liberal societies **provides
evidence contradicting the main claims** of liberal peace theories,
while **remaining consistent** with liberal pacification]{.underline}.
At its core, [liberalism is a project that **tries to maximize the
utility** of its subjects]{.underline} (in other words, [**minimize
suffering** while **maximizing happiness**]{.underline}). As such, [a
state of liberal peace should lead to a decrease in markers of
suffering. However, there is **more slavery** in the world today than
ever before, with conservative estimates of **between 12.3** and **27
million people** in debt bondage, chattel, or contract
slavery]{.underline} (Gordon 2012).17 Moreover, [there is **ample
evidence** of rising psychological disorders in liberal societies. A
**preponderance of evidence** from the United States suggests that
**depression**, **anxiety**, **alienation**, **opioid dependency**,
**stress**, **other related psychological disorders**, **increased
social isolation**, and the **decline of community have
increased**]{.underline} throughout the twentieth century (Twenge,
Zhang, and Im 2004, 320; Adler, Boyce, Chesney, et al. 1994; Twenge
2000; Twenge, Konrath, Foster, et al. 2008; Twenge, Gentile, DeWall, et
al. 2010; Cohen and Janicki-Deverts 2012; American Society of Addiction
Medicine 2016). [Changes to human life associated with modernity have
**caused psychological stress to increase**]{.underline} (Jackson 2014).
[**Mortality rates** have increased]{.underline} for some white,
non-Hispanics aged 45--54 in the United States between 1999 and 2013
(Case and Deaton 2015). [**Modern technological advances** from
television to the Internet may contribute to **increasing separation**
and **alienation**]{.underline} of the social human animal [into
**individualized bodies** connected by **increasingly weak** and **empty
bonds**]{.underline} (Putnam 2000; Gray 2011; Turkle 2011). At minimum,
[new information communication technology such as Facebook can
**increase the stress** and **anxiety** of its users]{.underline}
(Lee-Won, Herzog, and Park 2015). [The **violent structuring** of
liberalism enables **increases in social alienation**, **anxiety**,
**stress**, and **human bondage** through repression, economic control,
and social isolation.]{.underline}

[These are **not isolated instances** of suffering. They are
**fundamental structural features** of our liberal world]{.underline}.
If liberalism is a process of pacification rather than simply peace,
then this rise in individual suffering in liberal spaces may be evidence
of a similar process that Fanon equated with the psychic life of the
colonist. Just as Fanon's colonial subjects, unable to lash out at the
settler through direct violence, internalized their suffering, [modern
liberal subjects, **unable to resist liberal pacification**,
**internalize their suffering**]{.underline} (1982, chap. 6; cf. Sorel
1999, 118). [Liberal peace should bring about a rise in happiness; that
it has instead led to rising suffering is evidence of liberal
pacification]{.underline}.

Third, in addition to offering an alternative interpretation of the
liberal peace, our theory of liberal pacification supplements key
insights from critical approaches to peace. Tarak Barkawi and Mark
Laffey's work on imperial processes and liberal spaces makes a similar
point to ours, that the celebrated zone of liberal peace rests on
practices of violence (Barkawi and Laffey 1999, 2002; cf. Neocleous et
al. 2013). Their account, however, focuses on practices of direct
violence, such as humanitarian interventions against authoritarian
regimes or corporations hiring local militias to make work sites in the
global south safe for economic extraction (Barkawi and Laffey 1999,
422). Our point is that these moments of direct violence lead to
pacification wherein social relations have been so violently reordered
as to make direct violence no longer necessary. Once direct violence has
established liberal space, pacification functions as a structure of
violence that sustains the space. Direct violence only manifests itself
when pacification weakens.

Pacification, however, does not merely operate through manipulating the
conscience of its subjects. While Marxist and Gramscian concepts of
ideology and hegemony are consistent with our theory of pacification
(Peceny 1997, 418), they do not address how the constructed political
order sustains itself through a violent reordering of social relations.
A Gramscian-inspired critique of the democratic peace can yield a
bird's-eye view of the ways in which liberal peace theory is itself
deployed as an ideological tool (Ish-Shalom 2006, 569--75). However,
Gramscianinspired approaches do not account for the ways that everyday
practices of violence (for example, surveillance technologies, implied
threats from weapons, security barriers, etc.) sustain liberal
pacification. While ideational factors are important in pacification,
these factors rest upon practices and structures that are of an
ontological-existential character. To review, our reinterpretation of
the liberal peace as liberal pacification offers three novel insights.
First, [liberal scholars]{.underline} and others [associate the
development of the liberal order with peace and a decline in violence by
**ignoring** how pacification is part of the liberal
project]{.underline}. Second, [the empirically observed decline in
violence equated with the liberal peace is **not necessarily a sign of
human progress** but could be a sign of **intensified repression** or
**increases in other forms of suffering** across the liberal world
order]{.underline}. Third, our concept of [pacification reveals violence
that is neither direct nor indirect but is **phenomenologically
structured** into the world order. Understanding liberalism as
pacification produces a **paradigm shift**. Liberal pacification is
violent in the sense that it coerces a specific type of liberal
docility, while also preventing types of resistance that might be
understood as violent]{.underline}, including riots, insurrections,
civil wars, and interstate wars. [Pacification **reveals the ongoing
violence** at the heart of a political project that imagines itself to
be against violence.]{.underline}

Conclusion

Our account of pacification recovers a crucial aspect of pax, one
originally etched into Roman monuments. The heading of the Res Gestae
(the funeral monument to Emperor Augustus) reads, "\[t\]his is how he
\[Augustus\] made the world subject to the power of the people of Rome"
(Beard 2016, 364). This monument does not celebrate peace as the absence
of violence; it celebrates pacification. Pax takes the form of a process
that violently reorders the world so that imperial subjects are rendered
incapable of using violence to resist Roman rule. The absence of overt
acts of violence depends upon the maximization of pacification.

The practice of [pacification includes **threats**, **coercion**,
**intimidation**, and **surveillance** to restructure and sustain social
and political relations]{.underline}. When this type of violence
operates effectively, it appears as the absence of violence;
[pacification's violence resides in the structuring of the prevailing
order. While such an outcome **may appear peaceful**, it entails, at
best, a **negative peace** that operates through a **violent** and
**coercive reordering** of society.]{.underline}

[Liberal peace advocates measure direct violence and equate the decline
in that kind of violence with peace]{.underline}. However, our claim is
that [the spread of liberal institutions **does not necessarily decrease
violence** but **transforms it**. Our phenomenological analysis
**captures empirical trends** in human domination and suffering that
liberal peace theories **fail to account for**, including **increased
inequality**, **slavery**, **anxiety**, **addiction**, and
**anomie**]{.underline}. Our analysis also highlights how [a decline in
direct violence **may actually coincide** with the **transformation of
violence** in ways that are **concealed**, **monopolized**, and
**structured into the fabric of modern liberal society**]{.underline}.
If our theory is correct, [we will find **increases in markers of
suffering** as society liberalizes]{.underline}. While we cannot say
whether these indicators are unique to pacified liberal societies, it is
significant that they are rarely, if ever, discussed in terms of
violence and the liberal peace.

[Liberal pacification is **observationally equivalent** to liberal
peace. This is **not a semantic argument**. Liberal peace advocates
claim that processes that promote]{.underline} individual freedom and
autonomy (that is, [democracy, free markets, and global
institutions]{.underline}) [cause peace. While the **restructuring of
the global order**---**pacification**---**reduces direct violence**, it
also **restructures social relations** in ways that are violent.
Declines in directly observable violence **render other forms of
violence invisible** as violence; in fact, insidious, coercive, and
**violent systems of military deterrence** and **compellence**,
**nuclear terror**, **surveillance**, and **intimidation constitute the
worldhood** of the liberal order]{.underline}.

### AT: Realism Good

#### Realism is [bad]{.underline}, ensures racialization is [cemented]{.underline} in [all areas]{.underline} of IR.

**Vitalis 2K**(Robert, Professor of Political Science at the University
of Pennsylvania, "The Graceful and Generous Liberal Gesture: Making
Racism Invisible in American International Relations", CS)

[IR theorists have often hidden behind realism's wings to face these
kinds of criticism]{.underline}; they have argued that the
distinctiveness of their subject matter sets them apart and makes the
'norm against noticing' irrelevant in this case. [In relations among
states,]{.underline} where material power and interest govern the
behaviour of actors bent on survival in a violence-prone environment,
[an overarching logic of security and the national interest
prevails.]{.underline} Even [a 'domestic politics' of white
supremacy]{.underline}, to use a familiar adage, [stops at 'the water's
edge']{.underline}. [Pursuit of this particular line of
thought]{.underline}, however, [would quickly take the naïve defender of
an American-invented tradition down a slippery slope]{.underline}. The
empirical quandary remains. ['Until recently, race was a central
category in international relations]{.underline}' for statesmen,
intellectuals, and the white working classes of the colonial powers and
the industrialising colonial-settler states.17 More crucially still,
[realism's own proximate indigenous roots in the US may be found in part
in the 'rising tide of colour' theory]{.underline} in the 1920s and
related strains of Anglo-Saxon declinism.18 [Realism was not so much
'founded' in the 1940s by a wave of émigré continental European
scholars, but recast in line with Cold War imperatives, which included
the jettisoning of what was coming to be recognised as overt racist
doctrines by whites who ruled the 'kingdom of culture' and the writing
of a more useable past for their adopted discipline]{.underline}.19
[What needs to be explained is]{.underline} not how a particular domain
of intellectual life somehow escaped the bounds of ascriptive
Americanism---it didn't---but [why the 'norm against noticing' appears
to work so much more powerfully there than elsewhere inside the academy
until now?]{.underline} The question, I believe, involves 'domestic
institutions'. [Few signs remain of the academy's insurgent moment
inside professional IR in the U]{.underline}S.20 The [oppositional and
anti-imperialist values that constituted the original identity of
political economy]{.underline} in the 1960s and 1970s [are reflected
more powerfully]{.underline} today [in]{.underline} parts of
Anthropology, [Cultural Studies]{.underline}, Gender Studies,
Literature, and History [than in Political Science]{.underline}, and
more in British Political Science than in the American Political Science
Association. This might be gauged by comparing the renaissance in the
study of the culture of empire and American expansionism with the
paucity of work by political scientists. [One might look at the index of
the New Left Review over the past two decades for a sense of what is
'left' in Political Science and who in American IR might be publishing
there]{.underline}, aside from Richard Falk (answer: no one). Last, and
undoubtedly most important, [one might look around the room at the next
seminar, conference plenary, or talk for insight into the culture of
American IR and the operation of the 'norm against noticing'. The
absence of virtually any, let alone a critical mass of, black thinkers
and writers in the field today goes a long way toward explaining why
white supremacy remains an unexposed foundation of the field and why the
Black Atlantic remains an unrecognised source (for mostly white IR
scholars that is) of the emancipatory counter-currents that we know
today as imperialism theory, 'underdevelopment' 'postcolonial theory',
dependencia, world systems analysis, and so on.]{.underline}

### AT: Realism True

#### Scholars [critiquing realism]{.underline} are forced to make their theories fit within [constraining models]{.underline} of [conceptualization]{.underline} -- it isn't that realism is true, rather it is built to [subvert]{.underline} critique 

**Henderson 13**(Errol, Associate Professor of Political Science at
Pennsylvania State University, "Hidden in plain sight: racism in
international relations theory", CS)

[The centrality of race and racism in the foundations of IR and their
enduring impact on world affairs towards the end of the millennium
contrasts with the relative dearth of mainstream scholarship on the
subject in IR.]{.underline} For example, Doty's (1998, 136) survey of
mainstream journals in IR for the period of 1945 --1993 (World Politics,
International Studies Quarterly, International Organization, Journal of
Conflict Resolution, Review of International Studies) 'revealed only one
article with the word race in the title, four with the term minorities
and 13 with the term ethnicity'. Given that at its inception IR focused
heavily on issues of race and racism, the marginalization of race and
racism in mainstream IR journals (and textbooks) begs the question of
what accounts for the apparent disparity? Doty (1998, 145) argues that
'[the dominant understandings of theory and explanation in International
Relations' preclude conceptualizations of 'complex issues/concepts such
as race' and result in their marginalization or force them 'into
constraining modes of conceptualization and explanation']{.underline}.
For Krishna (2001, 401), [the complexity is related less to the issue of
racism than to the methodological orientations that often privilege
abstract theorizing over historical analyses, which allows IR theorists
to whitewash the historical content of global affairs, especially 'the
violence, genocide, and theft that marked the encounter between the rest
and the West in the post-Columbian era'.]{.underline} [Ignoring the role
of racism facilitates this whitewash]{.underline}. He adds that
'[abstraction, usually presented as the desire of the discipline to
engage in theory-building rather than in descriptive or historical
analysis, is a screen that simultaneously rationalizes and elides the
details of these encounters. By encouraging students to display their
virtuosity in abstraction the discipline brackets questions of theft of
land, violence, and slavery]{.underline}---the three processes that have
historically underlain the unequal global order we now find ourselves
in' (Krishna 2001, 401-- 402). Further, ['overattention' on the part of
scholars to issues related to racism in IR 'is disciplined by
professional practices that work as taboo' and may label such
orientations as 'too historical or descriptive' and label such students
as 'not adequately theoretical' and 'lacking in intellectual
rigor']{.underline} (Krishna 2001, 402). Moreover, where the impact of
race and racism is analysed, [insufficient attention is paid to the
relevance of struggles related to race and racism to basic conceptions
of fundamental issues in world politics such as power, war, freedom or
democracy]{.underline}. For example, Persaud (2001, 116) maintains that
'[what needs to be underlined is that the struggle for racial equality
has been fundamental to the emergence of democracy as a whole, not just
for the colored world']{.underline} (2001, 116). Persaud and Walker
(2001, 374) claim that [race has not been ignored in IR as much as it
'has been given the epistemological status of silence'.]{.underline}
This silence is linked by Maclean (1981, 110) to
['invisibility]{.underline}', which '[refers to the removal]{.underline}
(not necessarily through conscious action) [from a field of enquiry,
either concrete aspects of social relations, or of certain forms of
thought about them'.]{.underline} Vitalis (2000) also acknowledges a
'norm against noticing' white racism throughout mainstream IR discourse
(also see Depelchin 2005). [Each of these processes perpetuates the
racist assumptions embedded in the foundations of IR theory where they
serve as the 'priors' of the main propositions]{.underline}. These
assumptions may be exposed by tracing the racist claims that inform IR
theory. This approach is different from that undertaken in most studies
of racism in IR, which usually focus on one of four approaches: (1)
examinations of the impact of non-racial factors on racial outcomes,
such as the geographical studies of Linneaus and the physical
anthropological works of Blumenbach and Kant, which attempted to
determine the extent to which environmental and climatic factors led to
the creation of different races;3 (2) examinations of the impact of
racial outcomes on non-racial factors, such as studies of the effects of
racial stratification on domestic outcomes (for example, development or
democracy), or the impact of racial differences on the likelihood of
violence within or between states (for example, Deutsch 1970; Shepherd
and LeMelle 1970); (3) examinations of the impact of racist practices on
the IR of states and non-state actors, such as studies of diplomatic
historians on racist practices such as international slavery, imperial
conquest, colonialism, genocide, apartheid, occupation, or racial
discrimination, among single states, several states, or international
organizations (for example, Elkins 2004; Hochschild 1998; Tinker 1977;
Vincent 1982; Winant 2001); and (4) examinations of the impact of racist
ideology on the IR of states and nonstate actors, such as studies on the
impact of racism on foreign policy (for example, Hunt 1987; Lauren 1988;
Anderson 2003), imperialism (for example, Rodney 1974), state-making
(for example, Cell 1982; Fredrickson 1982; Mamdani 1996; Marx 1998),
diasporization (Harris 1982; Walters 1993) or international war (Dower
1986). While studies utilizing each of these approaches have contributed
to our understanding of the role of racism in world politics, they have
largely ignored the issue of primary concern to us here: how racism
informs the major paradigms of IR theory such as realism and
liberalism.4 [Racism informs IR theory mainly through its influence on
the empirical, ethical and epistemological assumptions that undergird
its paradigms]{.underline}. These assumptions operate individually and
in combination. For example, [racist empirical assumptions bifurcate
humanity on the basis of race and determine our view of what/whom we
study and how we study it/them]{.underline}---[privileging the
experiences of 'superior' peoples and their societies and
institutions]{.underline}. [These assumptions also lead us to privilege
ethical orientations of the 'superior' peoples which justify their
privileged statu]{.underline}s. In such a context[, epistemological
assumptions that reflect and reinforce the racist dualism are more
likely to become ascendant, and 'knowledge' that supports the racist
dichotomy]{.underline}---both the privileged position of the racial
hegemon and the underprivileged position of the racial subaltern---is
[more likely to be viewed as valid]{.underline}. Such [knowledge drawn
from the empirical domain becomes legitimized through ethical
justifications that 'naturalize' the racial hierarchy.]{.underline} In
this way, the separate dimensions often reinforce each other. [Whether
or not the empirical, ethical and epistemological assumptions operate
singly or in combination, it is important to demonstrate the role of
these assumptions in IR theory today, especially given that mainstream
IR also provides prominent critiques of racism]{.underline}. [Ignoring
these critiques would misrepresent the degree of racism in the field and
disregard the challenge to racist discourse within IR from IR theorists
themselves]{.underline}. For example, few IR scholars openly embrace a
racist ontology that assumes for whites a higher order of being than for
nonwhites.5 Moreover, racist ethical assumptions usually receive the
opprobrium they deserve in present IR discourse. [Racist epistemological
assumptions are largely challenged by the prevalence in IR theory of the
view that our 'knowledge' of world politics usually requires us to have
something approximating evidence to determine the accuracy of rival
truth claims]{.underline}. Finally[, racist empirical assumptions are
checked by the dominant view in IR that our theses should be broadly
applicable across states and societies and should be substantiated by
crossnational and cross-temporal tests]{.underline}. But the sanguine
view of [the propensity of IR literature to check racist assumptions, or
to generate non-racist theoretical discourse for the field, begs a
fuller exploration of how ethical, epistemological and empirical
assumptions underlie prominent theses in IR. The main sources of these
racist assumptions that inform our present IR discourse are the primary
theoretical constructs of most IR theory: the state of nature, the
social contract and the conception of anarchy that derives from
them.]{.underline}

## Framework

### Epistemology First

#### Epistemology comes [first]{.underline}\-\--the Kritik is a moment of [invasion]{.underline} as we enter into [IR centric spaces]{.underline} and introduce [radical ideas]{.underline}\-\--that [shapes]{.underline} those spaces.

**Gani and Marshal** **22**(Jasmine, PhD in International Relations from
the London School of Economics, Jenna, PhD Political Science, Queen Mary
University of London, "The impact of colonialism on policy and knowledge
production in International Relations", CS)

Thus far, [a lot of responsibility for challenging the racial and
colonial dynamics of the academic--practitioner nexus has been placed
with knowledge producers]{.underline}, whether within or outside
academia. But [it is necessary to emphasize that efforts have already
been under way, not only to 'decolonize' our academic disciplines, but
to bring that discourse into the public realm]{.underline}. At that
point [practitioners need to carry their share of responsibility in
listening to and applying the expertise]{.underline} (whether academic
or community-based) [that can foster more just policies.]{.underline}
Instead, [the attention policy-makers give to expertise is often
selective and politicized, based]{.underline} not on what can actually
improve people's lives but [on what helps to justify the existing
approaches adopted by governments. The current]{.underline} denigration
and growing [securitization of critical race theory,]{.underline}
especially in the United States but increasingly [elsewhere, is an
example of attacks on emancipatory knowledges that challenge power and
oppression]{.underline}. Offering another stark example of this, Amal
Abu-Bakare explores in her article the lack of any serious attempts to
confront Islamophobia in society, despite the wealth of research and
expert advice from scholars and community-based practitioners available
to policy-makers.55 Focusing on the cases of the UK and Canada, she
highlights the way in which [practitioner intervention]{.underline}, in
this case that of security and police officials, [has actively prevented
the adoption of expert guidelines on tackling Islamophobia]{.underline}
on the grounds that they might interfere with their counterterrorism
strategies. In many ways this is a blatant acknowledgement from
policy-makers that their [counterterrorism strategy is inherently built
upon racial tropes and discrimination.]{.underline} In contrast,
so-called '[neutral' research]{.underline} on terrorism and/or
counterterrorism [is embraced by practitioners, precisely because such
research might not ask uncomfortable questions about the racial
foundations or assumptions that are necessary to enact their
policies]{.underline}. Abu-Bakare's article offers an example of the
limitations of academic--practitioner knowledge exchange[. Exhorting
scholars to make their research policy relevant does not address the
unequal receptivity towards critical research that may challenge policy.
Nor does it sufficiently take into account the implicit disciplining
that can take place in that process of knowledge exchange.]{.underline}
[Those very spaces or channels that are created to facilitate sharing,
listening and negotiation]{.underline} between knowledge producers and
practitioners (through all the blurred boundaries between them) [may
reproduce and reify hierarchies through unequal
interactions]{.underline}. Is real dialogue possible if power dynamics
render the interlocutors unequal?56 Or, in their efforts to be heard,
taken seriously, and make their presence worthwhile, [academics and
other knowledge producers]{.underline} may [find themselves
being]{.underline} subtly [socialized into the very modes of speech and
thought that they sought to criticize.]{.underline} This can also happen
in reverse when grassroots practitioners share spaces with scholars and
elite institutions. [The path-breaking and radical ideas needed to
initiate change on some of the most deep-seated problems in politics and
society may be diluted in such spaces for the sake of pragmatism and
communication, undermining the ability to imagine real alternatives to
the status quo.]{.underline} This is not to say that [knowledge
producers]{.underline}, whether academic or community-based, should not
engage with policy-makers, but rather that [they should be clear in what
they seek to achieve---if, for example, constructive dialogue or
receptivity to expertise is unlikely, it is at times necessary and an
ethical responsibility simply to register alternative ideas or
contestation]{.underline}. Returning to the point made at the start of
this piece, [this cautions us in how we champion 'impact' and
knowledge--policy engagement, especially if we only recognize
engagements that supplement and are 'useful' to systems of power rather
than those that hold them to account.]{.underline}

### Privilege DA

#### Their evidence comes from a position of [privilege]{.underline}\-\--their authors ignore the complex [racialization]{.underline} of great power relations [compromising]{.underline} the quality of their theorizing and the [field of IR]{.underline} itself 

**Peterson 21**(V Spike, professor of international relations in the
School of Government and Public Policy at the University of Arizona,
"Critical privilege studies: Making visible the reproduction of racism
in the everyday and international relations", CS)

Familiar [structural inequalities]{.underline} -- of race, gender,
class, nationality -- [and corresponding systems of privilege constitute
relations of domination and subordination that figure centrally in the
social violence and multiple crises that international relations and
security scholars struggle to address]{.underline}. These
[scholars]{.underline}, however, [rarely engage a critique of privilege
when interpreting these processes, which effectively perpetuates the
invisibility (naturalization) of power relations and precludes more
adequate critical theorizing]{.underline}. Privilege refers to socially
conferred unearned advantages available to some by being constitutively
denied to others. Two implications of this structural relationship: [the
privilege enjoyed by dominant groups is literally at the expense of
subordinated groups, and systemic inequalities do not only harm those
who are dominated but significantly benefit -- every day and over time,
intentionally and unintentionally, directly and indirectly -- those who
are privileged. Failing to 'see' this crucial, consequential and
structural relationship -- and its affective consequences -- has
enormous implications for how adequately we understand the reproduction
of, and responses to, entrenched inequalities and the social violence
they generate.]{.underline} Not least, [we need to 'see' that conditions
generating internalized inferiority in those who are subordinated have
the effect of naturalizing internalized superiority in those who
can,]{.underline} and typically do, [assume that the advantages of
privilege and their practices of domination are 'just the way things
are'.]{.underline} Given the global expanse of harms, resentments, and
violences that we confront, I argue that [critical theorists --
in]{.underline} security studies, [international relations]{.underline},
and elsewhere -- [cannot afford to persist in neglecting
privilege]{.underline}. This [neglect perpetuates ignore-ance of
consequential power relations and obscures how practices of privilege,
every day and everywhere, operate to reinforce, normalize, and reproduce
structural inequalities]{.underline}. I assume that [critical security
studies seeks to further a reduction in emotional and embodied harms
produced by, and productive of, structural inequalities]{.underline},
and I argue that [doing so requires accurately understanding and
actively dismantling the power relations of privilege]{.underline}.
Accordingly, I contend that [failure to critically engage how privilege
operates severely compromises both the quality of current theorizing and
the future field of critical security studies.]{.underline} My
contribution, then, situates racism in the intersectional matrix of
structural inequalities, foregrounds how systems of privilege operate to
reproduce this matrix and its many harms, and examines the role of white
privilege in reproducing the invisibility and normalization of racism
(and its related inequalities). I present a condensed overview of what I
call 'critical privilege studies'2 and indicate how this analytical
framing contributes to 'a radically different, anti- or nonracist
\[international relations\] and everyday' (Rutazibwa, 2016: 199). I
argue that [the systematic study of privilege shifts our attention,
illuminates unfamiliar patterns, and enriches critical theorizing within
and beyond international relations. Critical privilege studies makes
distinctive contributions, primarily by examining how those who benefit
the most -- every day and everywhere -- participate in reproducing
inequalities, sometimes intentionally but also -- most often and most
problematically -- when not 'consciously' intending to do
so]{.underline} (but doing so all the same). The specific orientation of
critical privilege studies reveals how [normalization reproduces --
while concealing -- the power relations and structural logics of
dominant--subordinate relations, and how behaving 'normally' in unequal
systems reinforces and reproduces their hierarchies,]{.underline}
whether intentionally or not. Critical privilege studies clarifies how
[privilege works to entrench and amplify systemic inequalities, while
enabling those with privilege to be unaware of, habitually ignore, and
also deny how privilege tilts the playing field in their favor -- a
reality that fosters feelings of superiority for some and inferiority
for others.]{.underline} And by recognizing that everyone occupies
multiple social categories, [critical privilege studies uniquely engages
the complex dynamics of theorizing intersectionality and points to the
inadequacy of critical projects that focus exclusively on a single
vector of oppression.]{.underline}

### Being DA

#### Their framework is a form of [liberalism]{.underline} that [pacifies violence]{.underline} and [legitimizes]{.underline} military action creating zones of [being]{.underline} and [nonbeing]{.underline} 

**Van Milders and Toros 20**(Lucas, Assistant Professor in Critical
Security Studies at the University of Groningen, Harmonie, Deputy
Director of Institute of Cyber Security for Society (iCSS) at University
of Kent, "Violent International Relations", CS)

Indeed, [the 'international' nature of IR]{.underline} and of its
scholars [make the discipline a 'frontline' discipline that often
resides in practices along the abyssal lines between the zones of being
and nonbeing.]{.underline} [This is caused by]{.underline} the object of
enquiry of the discipline -- formally the power relations between states
but, as is increasingly recognised, [the power relations between
people]{.underline}. [It is also caused by the practices of the
discipline -- the need to perform the role and lifestyle of the
international expert for research, dissemination and increasingly
impact]{.underline}. There are many ways in which this is distributed
across the discipline, yet what [the iterations of disciplinary violence
in IR tend to have in common is a further proliferation of the limits of
IR as essentially an abyssal line.]{.underline} This concerns, for
instance, the decadent or disciplinary nature of mainstream IR, widely
critiqued elsewhere (such as in Ashley and Walker, 1990 and Weber, 2014
to name but two separated by decades). However, [critical strands of IR
theory might have]{.underline}, despite their efficacy at exposing the
violence performed by mainstream IR, [implicitly]{.underline} (and
presumably undeliberately) [contributed to the image of the critical
theorist as an expert or intellectual, characterised by the privilege to
withdraw politically and theorise both systemically as well as
globally]{.underline} (Linklater, 1996). [This image subsequently
solicits and naturalises a range of theoretical inquiries
that]{.underline} not only stem from the zone of being but also, as
mentioned above, [continue to demarcate an abyssal line around the
discipline]{.underline}. [This has]{.underline}, in recent years,
[allowed for the continued support for Western military violence in
post-colonial states, even when such instances have had disastrous
effects]{.underline} (see debate between Dunne and Gelber, 2014, Hehir,
2015, and again Dunne and Gelber, 2015 as well as the critique of
feminist support for war in Afghanistan in Wibben, 2011). [The violent
nature of IR is also evident from its inclusion of non-Western forms of
theory]{.underline} (typically presented as reactionary and
anti-Western) [on the premise that they do not challenge the
discipline's inherently Western epistemology]{.underline} (Buzan, 2018).
[The violence of IR theory is then characterised by its
capacity]{.underline} and often willingness [to maintain relations of
both material as well as epistemic coloniality.]{.underline} This
article is not about pointing accusatory fingers at specific instances
of disciplinary and epistemic violence, which would indeed aid to
exceptionalise said violence. Yet the question remains: what marks the
violence of IR that cannot be solely attributed to the fact that it is a
discipline like any other, and can we study IR without reproducing said
violence? To clarify, the type of violence we are talking about is not
merely the direct violence of physical and material force or the
indirect violence of the aggregate actions of social groups or
institutions, such as a refugee crisis or the concentration of wealth.
Rather, it is [the violence of pacification: a form of domination that
(re)structures the political order and ensures that violent resistance
against it is infrequent]{.underline} (Baron et al., 2019: 203). [The
violence of pacification is often inconspicuous, yet it operates through
means of coercion that are rendered visible whenever they are
resisted]{.underline}. As such, it is similar to Slavoj Žižek's
discussion of the maintaining function of objective violence in
capitalist ideology that incites the eruption of subjective violence of
anti-capitalist struggles and riots (2009). [In IR, this pacification is
distributed through the so-called liberal world order, often celebrated
for bestowing the world with liberal peace and a decline of
violence]{.underline} (Ikenberry, 2009; Pinker, 2012[). Yet liberal
pacification is still violent, as 'it coerces a specific type of liberal
docility, while also preventing types of resistance that might be
understood as violent,]{.underline} including riots, insurrections,
civil wars, and inter-state wars. [Pacification reveals the ongoing
violence at the heart of a political project that imagines itself to be
against violence]{.underline}' (Baron et al., 2019: 207). As it concerns
the shaping and maintaining of a political order that seeks to hide its
apparatus of violent coercion, [the violence of pacification also
intersects with the epistemic violence that is distributed through a
colonial epistemology. It is indeed the epistemic violence that seeks to
silence marginalised groups]{.underline} such as the subaltern
nonspecialists, the illiterate peasantry, and the urban subproletariat
(Spivak, 1994). [Through IR's violence, the international is
reconfigured into a discipline that silences these voices in a seemingly
non-violent way by subjugating their experiences as in need of
translation or assimilation into expert knowledge that can be evaluated
against disciplining/disciplinary criteria, that is, impact. So as
opposed to trivilialising IR's violence by exceptionalising it, we
rather seek to highlight the deeply embedded nature of this violence
across the discipline, although of course distributed to varying
degrees.]{.underline}

### AT: Evaluating Scholarship Bad

#### Their evidence is the [product]{.underline} of the [system]{.underline} that encouraged it\-\--[methodological whiteness]{.underline} is unquestionably accepted as the [true logic of security studies]{.underline}, creating a never-ending cycle of [securitization]{.underline} and threat [construction]{.underline}

**Gani and Marshal** **22**(Jasmine, PhD in International Relations from
the London School of Economics, Jenna, PhD Political Science, Queen Mary
University of London, "The impact of colonialism on policy and knowledge
production in International Relations", CS)

[If academia has had a long history of supplying imperial policy through
its knowledge production, the reverse has also been
true]{.underline}---it is not a unidirectional process. Thus, i[mperial
policies and those that embed racial injustices have often provided the
starting-point for academic enquiry, with imperialist and racist
constructions taken as the material reality from which to launch any
research, without historicization or interrogation of whether that is
how it has to be]{.underline}. The risk of academia being a mule for
unjust and oppressive assumptions generated through colonial and racist
practice looms even larger with the increased emphasis in academia on
the necessity of applying for and obtaining research grants. [Many
funding bodies are dependent on state subsidies, or are financed by the
corporate sector or by benefactors from the business and political
elite]{.underline}.27 When it comes to selecting prize-winners, [the
committees are often made up of members from the business community to
assess the potential 'real world']{.underline} (and presumably monetary)
[impact of the proposed research.]{.underline} Thus [academia is not a
bastion of intellectual autonomy, but is increasingly allowing the
parameters and goals of research to be delineated by practitioners and
their priorities]{.underline}. Where [those practitioners have vested
interests]{.underline} (as is often likely, even if not always the case)
[in a social, economic and political status quo that upholds systemic
discrimination against marginalized communities, the potential for
deep-rooted long-term change becomes muted]{.underline}. This special
issue accordingly demonstrates how [academic knowledge production risks
reifying colonial and racial injustices]{.underline}. Like so-called
[impartial reporting in journalism, which indirectly becomes a
convenient and efficient means for political elites to distribute their
messages]{.underline}, [IR as a discipline can end up being a
disseminator of the rationales and motives of
policy-makers.]{.underline} Thus [the supposed neutrality of analytical
theorizing and empiricism]{.underline},[28 which claim merely to observe
and predict impartially the way the world is and will be without
problematization, can be seen as complicit in normalizing what should in
fact be treated as abnormal, even unacceptable.]{.underline} Several
contributions apply this argument to [particular regions and debates
where the inherent absorption of unjust practices and erasures within
knowledge production is particularly egregious]{.underline}. The
articles by Kwaku Danso and Kwesi Aning, and by Somdeep Sen, both [call
for greater challenges to the centrality of the state in IR, and
criticize the way it has mirrored an (often colonial) international
practice of delegitimizing non-state actors.]{.underline} In their
article, Danso and Aning complicate Weberian notions of the state
monopoly on violence, extending validity and recognition to non-state
actors in their ability to act as authoritative avenues for dispute
resolution.29 They further make the case for [the unsettling of
knowledge within security studies,]{.underline} especially when engaging
with the African continent, arguing that [methodological whiteness has
been unquestioningly accepted as the logic that underpins much of
security studies discourse. This lack of problematization racializes
Africa as ungovernable, and flattens or often entirely negates any
substantive understandings of the complexities of lived
experiences]{.underline}.30 Their article also makes visible the ways in
which [academic eagerness to supply regional case-studies for the sake
of policy relevance and proof of 'universal theories' impact people's
lived realities]{.underline}. They make their point explicit through an
illustration of the 'war on terror' discourses within the Sahel region.
Providing an alternative example, Sen argues that [academic scholarship
has contributed to the concretization of the state and its violence as
'normal politics', while insurgency]{.underline} (or, in other words,
anti-colonial resistance) is [thereby rendered 'unnatural' and
existentially dangerous for global order]{.underline}.31 [In failing to
question the sanctity of the state, scholars have been complicit in
upholding colonial practice and the outlawing of resistance, consigning
it beyond the realm of acceptable politics, as seen in contexts such as
Palestine]{.underline}. Sharri Plonski and Nivi Manchanda extend these
arguments about unsettling the fixity of the state and its borders, but
also expand where we look to first to identify the producers of
knowledge.32 Thus, they argue [knowledge is not necessarily always
produced within the academy, but often is first made (and indeed
exchanged and concretized) through (colonial) practice and, in turn, via
normalization that converts the practice into 'fact' that goes
unchallenged by academic knowledge producers]{.underline}. Their article
demonstrates the way [colonial and racist knowledges are nourished,
upheld and validated by silences within broader epistemic
communities---communities in which the boundaries between academics,
policy-makers and corporations are much more fluid than a strict binary
between academics and practitioners]{.underline}. Recognizing this
fluidity also serves to disrupt the 'bridge the gap' debate discussed at
the outset of this article.

### Alt\-\--Post-Racist Critical IR

#### Vote negative for [post-racist critical IR scholarship]{.underline} -- revealing the [Westphilian epistemologies]{.underline} present in the aff is [critical]{.underline} to holding them accountable for their double standards and working towards [decolonization]{.underline} 

**Hobson 07**(John, Professor of Politics and International Relations at
the University of Sheffield, "Is critical theory always for the white
West and for Western imperialism? Beyond Westphilian towards a
post-racist critical IR", CS)

If Eurocentrism portrays the West as bringing the world to heel,
[post-racist emancipatory politics seeks to bring the world to
hea]{.underline}l. How, then, might we begin to imagine this?
[Post-racist IR singles out analyses of identity-formation and
civilisational dialogues/dialectics as the first port of call for a
global emancipatory politics]{.underline}. The centre-piece of racism as
it has been constructed in the West is a repressing of the Other in the
Self. It is precisely this that underpins the Eurocentric construction
of a line of civilisational apartheid, which creates the illusion of a
pure, self-generating, supremacist White Western Self. [Accepting the
Other in the Self and recognising that the Self is therefore hybrid must
be central to the process of global reconciliation]{.underline}. The
second step is, however, much more fraught but all the more pressing
nevertheless -- namely the creation of a political dialogue between East
and West.100 This can take the form of a counter-hegemonic bloc
comprising a rainbow coalition of groups from the West though mainly
from the East, which can articulate an alternative discourse to
challenge Eurocentric post-racism. Still, [there are]{.underline}
undoubtedly [many hurdles]{.underline} that stand in its way. These
include the not inconsiderable [spiritual capital that Westerners have
invested in their Eurocentric identity; the economic interests of
capital in maintaining post-racist neo-colonialism]{.underline}; and,
ironically, those Eastern political elites who embrace Eurocentrism in
order to hold on to power. But [global reconciliation need not be
portrayed as an impossible dawn, for there is historical precedent here
in the shape of the Eastern nationalist movements that successfully
challenged the discourse of empire.]{.underline} And while
decolonisation has been succeeded by the imposition of post-racist
policies this should not detract from the success of Eastern resistance
agency in terminating formal empire. Decolonisation also provides a
crucial precedent given that 'the setting of the sun on the British
empire' was always portrayed by the British elites as an impossible
dusk. Salutary too is that Nelson Mandela's long walk to freedom would
also have appeared prior to its success as a feat too far. Naeem
Inayatullah and David Blaney argue that this [political dialogue needs
to work on an empathic approach in which both sides appeal to their own
experiences of suffering]{.underline}.101 [This needs to be coupled with
a major injection of humility in the West, which can be enabled by
revealing, and facing up to, the massive moral debt that it owes the
East]{.underline} (given that the East did so much to enable the West's
rise through both dialogue and sacrifice). In any case, [failure to do
this is to be complicit with that which went on not just in the past but
also in the last fifty years]{.underline}. But alongside these
rhetorical manoeuvres, the Eastern and [Western spokespersons need to
emphasise the contradictions and double standards that underpin
contemporary post-racist Western foreign policy]{.underline}. [Here they
need to engage not simply in dialogue but a dialogical dialectic wherein
the East prosecutes the unfair and hypocritical practices of the
post-racist West in what might be called the 'global court of social
justice'.]{.underline} This is not a legal entity, though it is governed
like any (formal) court by a certain set of (social) norms that
adjudicate over what is right and wrong. The nationalist movements
effectively prosecuted the West in the global court of social justice
through 'mimetic challenge',102 or 'rhetorical entrapment',103 where
they rendered empire illegitimate by appealing to Western social norms
of justice, since there was no other way of revealing the racist double
standards that the West committed in its imperial policies (much as the
Black Jacobins had done in the earlier Haitian revolution).104
Crucially, [if revealing the racism of empire had such powerful import
in effecting decolonisation, then why cannot the strategy of revealing
post-racism today equally be used to decolonise contemporary
neo-colonialism]{.underline}? [Thus a counter-hegemonic bloc needs to
work within the interstices of Western discourse to reveal the
postracist contradictions and double standards that it consciously and
subconsciously smoothes over, in order to demonstrate how the West
currently fails to uphold its own self-referential norms of human
justice]{.underline}. Appealing only to Eastern norms would most likely
be rejected out of hand by the West with no progress forward possible.
Indeed, '\[f\]or [the oppressed it is a strategic necessity to address
the oppressor in its own language, the language which it knows and
understands: indeed the point is to manipulate the self-understanding of
the oppressor]{.underline}'.105 Besides, no court can operate according
to conflicting norms. And it is to the West that the East must turn if
only because it currently holds disproportionate (though not
anthropomorphic) power. Still, [this dialogical project is one that can
simultaneously benefit the West.]{.underline}106 For as noted,
[Eurocentrism leads to the repression and sublimation of the Other in
the Self.]{.underline} [Thus doing away with Eurocentrism can end the
sociopsychological angst and alienation that necessarily occurs through
such sublimation.]{.underline} Indeed, the ultimate irony is that
[racist/post-racist Western imperialism has underdeveloped the Western
Self.]{.underline} And so, hopes for Western emancipation must to an
important extent lie with the 'Eastern civilising mission' and the
associated ['Black Human's Burden', which can launch the Western peoples
on an ethnographic maiden Voyage of Self-discovery that, with humility,
empathy and above all sincerity, steers around the icebergs of tragic
self-deception to return fully humanised. In the process, we take one
giant leap towards a global dream that exorcises the global nightmare of
cycles of war and Western civilising missions -- a dream in which the
dusk of post-racism brings in its wake the dawn of a new era wherein the
peoples of the world can finally sit down at the table of global
humanity and communicate together as equal partners.]{.underline}

### Alt\-\--Insignificant Acts of Resistance

#### Vote neg to further [insignificant acts of resistance]{.underline}\-\--slowly putting cracks into the [regime]{.underline} is the only way we can successfully [challenge]{.underline} it 

**Van Milders and Toros 20**(Lucas, Assistant Professor in Critical
Security Studies at the University of Groningen, Harmonie, Deputy
Director of Institute of Cyber Security for Society (iCSS) at University
of Kent, "Violent International Relations", CS)

What we are more interested in here is [how we can challenge the
violence of the zone of being, our violence.]{.underline} Thus, what we
aim to explore [is how to remain 'in']{.underline}-- in Mogadishu, in
rooms with Western military and defence officials -- [while
refraining]{.underline} (as far as possible) [from participating in
structural and epistemic violence, and indeed challenging
it]{.underline}. Such a [staying 'in' would allow critical IR scholars
to uncover the fissures]{.underline} (Horkheimer, 1982) [that exist in
all structures of violence, and attempt to expose them and enlarge
them]{.underline}. Before elaborating on this, it is important to point
out that such an attempt is not rooted in the belief that we can find a
path towards a completely ethical future in IR scholarship. Just as we
argue that there is no ethical past to ground ourselves in -- on the
contrary, there is only a violent past -- [we are not contemplating the
possibility of an ethical future free of tensions and
violence.]{.underline} Such a stance is not of the purview of critical
scholars, as it is inevitably based in the misrecognition of violences
that always mark -- to some degree -- human social relations. [Our
aim]{.underline} is far more modest and thus hopefully more honest in
that it [seeks a path of discomfort that is ethical enough to allow for
an engagement with today's power structures,]{.underline} which we
continue to insist are in need of critique and countering, [also from
within]{.underline}. Drawing some foundations from research on the
everyday and the banal, [we want to argue in favour of almost
insignificant acts of subversion in the zones of being]{.underline}.
These are [acts that are so small]{.underline} that, for example, [they
cannot be used as a reason to exclude scholars from a gathering or even
indeed to refrain from re-inviting them.]{.underline} They are almost
insignificant. [It is in the almost however that we seek ethical moments
that have the potential to highlight and enlarge the fissures of violent
power structures]{.underline}. Just as banal nationalism (Billig, 1995)
can be 'significant and political' and instances of \'everyday peace'
and \'everyday resistance' can be generative (Mac Ginty, 2014: 552;
Vinthagen, 2015), [almost insignificant acts of subversion
can,]{.underline} we argue, [be disruptive and generative]{.underline}.
Such acts can take a variety of forms and, just as everyday peace, they
\'probably cannot be modelled, taught or replicated' (Mac Ginty, 2014:
554). [They are available in the immediate and only exist
contextually]{.underline}. [They differ from the concept of the
\'everyday']{.underline} insofar as the term has been used in IR to mean
[practices that are of the \'realm of the routine and humdrum which we
take for granted']{.underline} (Holloway and Hubbard, 2001: 33). Our
[acts of subversion are]{.underline} just the opposite: They are
[precisely those conscious acts of agency that may be disguised within
the routine and humdrum but that in fact aim to challenge and subvert
it]{.underline}. They recognise our position as agents, our being
internationals and use this position to authorise these minute acts that
challenge our exclusive right to be. Methodologically, [they operate
like a crack -- 'the perfect ordinary creation of a space or moment in
which we assert a different type of doing']{.underline} (Holloway, 2010:
21). What this means in terms of practices is not obvious and all we can
put forward here is a discussion that is aimed at clarifying our
argument rather than offer an exhaustive list of what they may entail.
As such, we identify three forms of almost insignificant acts of
subversion that acknowledge the position from which the enunciation
takes place: (a) [moments in which one implicitly recognises
and,]{.underline} if appropriate, [highlights the other as different but
equal]{.underline}; (b) [moments in which one implicitly
recognises]{.underline} and, if appropriate, [explicitly speaks out the
power disparity and violence of a relationship]{.underline}; and (c)
[moments in which one implicitly recognises]{.underline} and, if
appropriate, [explicitly highlights the violence of power structures
generally made invisible through habitus]{.underline} (Bourdieu, 1977).
As with everyday peace, such subversion 'is not something that people
always and necessarily engage in. It relies on opportunities and
context, as well as the ability of individuals and groups to exploit
these' (Mac Ginty, 2014: 550). Context -- [the power structures
surrounding the individual and the latter's capital within those
structures -- will be central to an actor's ability to engage in such
acts and to what degree]{.underline}.

### AT: IR Isn't Intrinsically Racist

#### The historical record goes neg.

**Lake et al. 21**(David, Distinguished Professor of Political Science
at the University of California, San Diego, Bianca Freedman, PhD
candidate in the Department of Political Science at UC San Diego, D.G.
Kim, Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at the
University of California, San Diego, "Race in International Relations:
Beyond the "Norm Against Noticing"", CS)

The critique of IR's race blindness begins with the Howard School. The
tradition of unveiling the modern world from its racialized origins was
proffered by Howard University--based African American IR scholars
beginning in the late nineteenth century (Henderson 2013, 2017;
Vitalis2015). Arguably path-breaking, the contributions associated with
the Howard School highlight IR's systematic failure to appreciate race
and its inscription into world order. [Silence about racism in IR,
imposed in part by the exclusion of work that advanced its
critique]{.underline} (Vitalis 2000), [obscured race as an orienting
worldview in the emergent field]{.underline}. Despite various
adaptations of publications like Foreign Affairs---which had been titled
the Journal of Race Development from 1910 to 1919---[its genealogy
implies what early scholars deemed the subject of IR to be]{.underline}.
This veneer of substantive change in the discipline was counterpoised by
W.E.B. Du Bois's seminal thesis on the color line, first offered in The
Souls of Black Folk\[2015 (1903)\] and later extended in "The Color Line
Belts the World" (1906). Du Bois noted, ["The problem of the twentieth
century is the problem of the Color Line]{.underline}" \[2005 (1906), p.
33\]. For Du Bois, [White supremacy and anti-Blackness were organizing
principles of US expansionism]{.underline}. Similarly, other scholars of
the Howard School made plain that [theorizing the international required
careful scrutiny of its imperial, colonial, and neocolonial
foundation]{.underline}s \[Locke 1992 (1916), Bunche 1936, Tate
(1943)\]. [Notwithstanding, mid-century debates in the field over
stability, dependency, and territorial sovereignty were underpinned with
racial ontologies, willful or otherwise, that privileged Whiteness in
their assumptions about the social world]{.underline} (Vucetic
2016).This early critique of IR's race blindness was elaborated in
opposition to the incipient field's essentialist notions of race. For
Alain Locke and Ralph Bunche, race was what today we recognize as a
social construct based on phenotypic characteristics that are themselves
socially constructed. By advancing this argument, Locke and Bunche
removed race from its biological and anthropological moorings,
effectively rejecting the "hierarchy of races" assumption that anchored
the developing field of IR (Henderson 2013). Locke's \[1992 (1916)\]
sociological thesis of race as a product occulture informed Bunche's
(1936) subsequent analysis in A World View of Race. For Bunche, race was
arbitrary. Devoid of any scientific meaning, race was a device of
national policy that shaped bargaining in class conflict. The Howard
School also anticipated much of the postwar scholarship on race and
racism in IR. To be sure, it developed some of the earliest theory of
modern war as an outcome of imperialist and other racial projects (Du
Bois 1915, Tate 1943, Bunche 1936), a point delivered in Henderson's
(2017) critique of Vitalis's (2015) apparent disassociation of these
scholars from the formulation of IR theory. Though met with scant
regard, [the insights developed]{.underline} by the Howard [School
unveil an IR that not only noticed race but also highlighted it as a
prominent axis of inquiry and theory building]{.underline}. [The norm
against noticing has since been engaged by scholars, and this
confrontation actively informs the present debate.]{.underline} Across
interlocking approaches to the study of race, [new scholarship coheres
around the assertion that race and racism are unavoidable when grappling
with the is-sues and methodologies of IR]{.underline} (Persaud & Walker
2000; Shilliam 2013, 2020b). [The norm against noticing has been
challenged by excavating disciplinary genealogies and unveiling forms of
racialization as power in IR.]{.underline} Burgeoning literature on
Eurocentrism (Hobson 2012) and new advances in non-Western IR theory,
embodied by the "Global IR" project (Acharya & Buzan 2009, Haggard& Kang
2020), similarly examine the imperial conditions that constitute
relations between the European "core" and the non-White "peripheries."
[Recent contributions in the field also illuminate the racial and
gendered patterns of IR canon formation.]{.underline} In a recent essay,
for instance, [Hutchings & Owens (2021) expose opportunities to theorize
race in IR through a fundamental reorientation toward the international
thought of women]{.underline} (of color).

### AT: IR=Redeemable

#### The alt is a [prerequisite]{.underline} to ethical IR scholarship -- [discomfort]{.underline} is necessary to deter institutions from employing the [politics of denial]{.underline} 

**Vitalis 2K**(Robert, Professor of Political Science at the University
of Pennsylvania, "The Graceful and Generous Liberal Gesture: Making
Racism Invisible in American International Relations", CS)

Once, after I presented an account of the Saudi case, a colleague asked:
'why do you seem surprised by any of this, what did you expect?' This
question tells us something about how [the Cold War 'norm against
noticing', the 'graceful and generous liberal gesture']{.underline}
proceeds, what it [presumes. Race is already known, banal and
commonplace, not worth noticing.]{.underline} Race is 'really' something
else. [Race is a 'language that most would today find offensive and
inappropriate'.]{.underline} This last statement sums up how the best
history we have to date of the discipline of IR, Political Discourse of
Anarchy, by Brian Schmidt, deals with the most significant force in
American politics and culture. Schmidt dismisses in a single sentence in
a self-styled discursive history what was known at the time to be basic
to understanding world politics, the 'conflict of color'.89 More
recently, a colleague politely pressed me to name a single work by the
towering intellect of the twentieth century that was significant for any
aspect of IR. This form of question is a well-known reflex that is
triggered when canons of seemingly timeless truths come under
interrogation. But the truth is that '[African Roots of War', Du Bois'
bold attempt to theorise on imperialism and global
conflict,]{.underline} which his biographer Levering Lewis calls 'one of
the analytical triumphs of the early twentieth century', [has never been
anthologised or discussed in any IR theory text in the
US]{.underline}.90 While 'African Roots' was celebrated then, and Du
Bois lectured widely to black and white audiences at home and abroad on
the topic, we are much more likely now to reference white writers---E.D.
Morel's Africa and the Peace of Europe, and especially, Lenin's
Imperialism: [The Highest Stage of Capitalism---when creating our
genealogies and canons of anti-imperialism and 'radical' theory
traditions in world politics]{.underline}. Lord Zimmern, in contrast to
Du Bois, is almost always included in one story IR tells about World War
I and its putative impact on the emerging discipline in Great Britain
and the US.91 But the transcripts of Lord Zimmern's deeply rooted,
extended, and quite serious conversations with his many colleagues about
race as a fundamental part of world order, 'the most urgent problem of
our time', inevitably go unreported, and so the questions they raise for
Zimmern's successors remain unresolved. The first post-war generation of
émigré theorists was equally successful in mythmaking of its own. They
created a world where realist thought in its classic geopolitical mode
is a coherent and continuous tradition across space and time. [Today's
national security debates and self-serving 'strategic justifications'
are represented as the close echoes of earlier debates inside imperial
states and societies]{.underline}. At key moments, the promotion of
civilisation, greatness, and modernity (or, now, democracy and market
economies), [the preservation of a hegemon's credibility, and other
expansionist credos trump the arguments of those who really understand
the true strategic or security value inhering in one course over that of
another]{.underline}. Old metaphors are compared with new ones, for
instance, a row of falling dominoes, a barrel contaminated by one rotten
apple, and the like.92 Representatives of the American geopolitics
tradition, such as Ellsworth Huntington and Alfred Thayer Mahan, can be
summoned and selectively quoted without ever acknowledging their concern
with the world racial balance of power that launched the quest for a
whitewater Navy as defence against the teeming Asian multitudes who
threatened from land and sea.93 [It is in the forgotten, yet vast
literature and the terms of the ongoing public debate on 'race war' that
we can trace the roots of what is later recast as an American realist
tradition in IR theory.]{.underline} We have to acknowledge,
nonetheless, [that the collectivity that identifies itself as 'the field
of International Relations' in the US is tightly, organically bound to a
particular place, history, and social formation]{.underline}.94 [This
inescapable fact]{.underline}, which applies equally across 'schools' of
thought and methodological 'approaches', [goes far to explain why IR
today has little to say about racism as an international institution or
white supremacy as the identity of the American state that the field's
founders embraced and elaborated.]{.underline} [Certainly, this
problematique would provide a better explanation than one that would
simply erase racism from the historical record else deny its
importance.]{.underline} It would place the post-Holocaust, post-World
War II invention of realism as a tradition that argues against the
explanatory significance of ideas (and morality) in world politics in a
new and disturbing light. [Critical alternatives need to be elaborated
in opposition to the 'norm against noticing' and to the wider so-called
'realist' strains in American life (defined against hopelessly utopian
visions about 'ending war' or 'transcending capitalism') that, without a
hint of irony, insist that a 'colour blind' society is now within easy
reach]{.underline}.95 [Such are the terms today in which privilege is
defended and hierarchy reconstituted. The embeddedness of writers and
readers in a particular cultural formation is inescapable. But so too is
the work of 'clearing intellectual and moral space' in this particular
part of the increasingly globalised academy]{.underline}: [Racial
constructs are being forced to reveal their struts and bolts, their
technology and their carapace, so that political action, legal and
social thought, and cultural production can be generated sans racist
cant, explicit or in disguise]{.underline}.96 Political Science, like
other institutions, is constituted and regulated by a set of norms and
armoured by a repertoire of material awards and sanctions that can
affect the likelihood that members of the profession themselves will
pursue the work that Toni Morrison writes about in 'Home'.97 My interest
in [writing on racism]{.underline} is the chance that it [offers to
imagine what can be done to make it less easy and less safe for others
to practice the politics of its denial.]{.underline}

### AT: No Spill Up

#### [Yes]{.underline} spill out. This is [not simply]{.underline} ivory tower theorizing\-\--academia [spills out]{.underline}, [shaking]{.underline} the foundation for racialized IR

**Gani and Marshal** **22**(Jasmine, PhD in International Relations from
the London School of Economics, Jenna, PhD Political Science, Queen Mary
University of London, "The impact of colonialism on policy and knowledge
production in International Relations", CS)

First, as a number of the contributions argue,[15 academia has been a
predominant influence in the production of broad epistemic communities.
In the course of this process, academic knowledge production has acted
as a supplier of racial, civilizational and imperialist discourse,
ideology and 'logic' that were]{.underline} (and are) [disseminated
through research, teaching and broader public
intellectualism.]{.underline} Bearing in mind that [many policy-makers
have been taught and trained within academia]{.underline}, especially
elite institutions, [it is necessary to recall that IR departments were
founded]{.underline} in the early twentieth century in the United
Kingdom and United States [precisely to serve the purpose of informing
imperial administrations]{.underline}.16 While this form of transmission
is impossible to quantify precisely, the articles in this special issue
show that nevertheless [universities, along with think tanks and
journals, delineated the parameters of rational and acceptable
debate]{.underline}. That the [ideas emanated]{.underline} (as they
still do) [from so-called bastions of scholarship and rigour meant they
carried greater credibility and gravitas, and were accompanied by an
assumption that they had been scientifically tested.]{.underline} In
many cases [universities and intellectuals were responsible for
upholding the legitimacy of racist hierarchies and the necessity of
colonialism in the West against the grain of anti-colonial and
anti-racist social movements and intellectuals in the colonies, and
subsequent grassroots movements for the abolition of colonialism and
racism in the West]{.underline}. Thus, [in contrast to the common
refrain that academia is an 'ivory tower' that is disconnected from the
real world, in IR it has in fact routinely demonstrated the opposite,
with the capacity to embed and systematize racism, scavenging the
disorganized and reactionary fears of society and refining them in such
a way that they appear rational]{.underline},17 [indeed necessary for
the sake of order, security and communal peace]{.underline}. A second
way in which [academia]{.underline} has historically fed and [continues
to feed policy]{.underline} is in a more direct way---[through a supply
chain of academically trained experts who go on to work in policy,
either as consultants or by holding office in government or in other
state institutions]{.underline} such as the military. This pattern was
laid down during the peak period of European colonialism, the [clearest
example bein]{.underline}g provided by [J. S. Mill:]{.underline}
[despite being a philosopher]{.underline}, [he was]{.underline} anything
but detached from the 'real world', [taking up the position of colonial
officer in British-controlled India]{.underline}, arguing against Indian
self-rule on the racist intellectual basis that the natives were still
in their infancy.18 Such 'knowledge entrepreneurs' were at the forefront
of the knowledge ordering indispensable to Britain's expansion into
south Asia. [These 'epistemological invasions', alongside the core group
of 'European explorers, diplomats, military men, and Company officials',
had the chief function of producing 'a proto-episteme' or 'corpus of
knowledge' by which the region was rendered legible for imperial
expansion.]{.underline}19 Later, the [urgent imperatives of war
established the revolving door that turned scholars into practitioners
and vice versa]{.underline}, as witnessed, for example, in the interplay
in 1930s British East Africa between colonial administrations and
anthropologists to ensure indirect rule.20 But [such close embodied
relationships between academics and imperial governance were not
confined to the age of formal empires]{.underline}. [The scholarly
sanitizing and rebranding of contemporary imperialism as 'hegemony' or
'soft power' prevents us from applying anti-colonial critiques to
contemporary empires.]{.underline} In his contribution to the special
issue, Randolph Persaud argues that [this is a complicity especially
epitomized by US 'Disciplinary IR', and challenges the feigning of
neutrality in US-led theorizing, calling for it to be recognized as
implicitly ideological]{.underline}.21 Moreover[, it is precisely their
ideological character that renders such academics 'useful' and allows
them to move smoothly into policy roles.]{.underline} Thus, for Persaud,
[their service as practitioners acts as the chief conduit for those
ideologies to travel into and be socialized in policy]{.underline}.
Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Barack Obama, and Secretaries of State
Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice, are just some of the examples of
academics who have served in high office in the United States. [The
notion that academic expertise might temper imprudence and propensity
for war in policy-making is refuted by their respective willingness to
approve of foreign occupations, military intervention, coups, drone
attacks or authoritarian allies abroad, and of racial securitization,
border regimes and incarceration at home.]{.underline} As Persaud points
out[, beyond those holding office there are multiple examples of
academics who have acted as advisers to governments, obliquely upholding
the principles of imperialism under the guise of 'grand strategy' or the
'liberal international order']{.underline}.

### AT: Perm

#### Silencing DA: The perm reinforces the "norm against noticing."

**Henderson 13**(Errol, Associate Professor of Political Science at
Pennsylvania State University, "Hidden in plain sight: racism in
international relations theory", CS)

In fact, [the 'norm against noticing' white racism is so intense that it
engenders a 'silencing' of those who would raise it; or it ensures
against publication in mainstream outlets for such work except that
authors provide appropriate euphemisms for the atrocities associated
with white racism]{.underline}---especially against blacks---[or they
provide the requisite 'balance' to emphasize the role of nonwhites in
their own subjugation]{.underline}---[as if white supremacism and the
imperialism, colonialism, neocolonialism and internal colonialism that
it has employed against Africans, Asians, and Native Americans are
somehow the responsibility of groups other than the whites who created,
maintained and continue to profit from them.]{.underline} Thus, the
racist dualism in world politics creates, in turn, a dual quandary for
IR scholars and many Africanists seeking to publish in Western
journals---and many non-Western ones, too---wherein [white racist
expectations of the appropriateness of certain lines of inquiry often
limit the discourse of African politics to hollow phraseology and
meaningless metaphors]{.underline}, [while they simultaneously check
informed challenges to historical and contemporary expressions,
practices and institutions of white racism in academia by ensuring that
such racism is rarely confronted in the major publications in IR/world
politics in clear and direct terms]{.underline}. Another result is that
[the norm against noticing white racism leaves IR scholars teaching a
history of the development of IR which ignores the salience of
colonialism as central to the origins of the field]{.underline}. That
is, [in continuing to teach the fiction that the field emerged following
the devastation of World War I as 'idealists']{.underline} led by Wilson
and others such as Lowes Dickinson, Zimmern, Giddings and Kerr sought to
provide the institutional checks on the realpolitik that was implicated
in the 'war to end all wars', [we belie the reality of the centrality of
colonialism, race development and white racial supremacy to the
development of the academic field of IR]{.underline}. Thus, [our
narrative creates an academic fiction that hovers outside of its own
history.]{.underline} The presence of this narrative is a testament to
the white supremacism that is a centrepiece of the field given its role
in ensuring a 'norm against noticing' the centrality of white racism in
world politics. [It simultaneously silences or marginalizes perspectives
that focus on the importance of white racism in the development of the
field of IR/world politics, and similarly, those who would raise this as
a legitimate research focus for the most sensible of reasons: it happens
to be true.]{.underline}

#### Substitution DA: The alt is [mutually exclusive]{.underline} and a [sequencing question]{.underline}. Critical interrogation should be [independent]{.underline} of policy focus.

**Chandler and Chipato 21**(David, Professor of International Relations
at University of Westminster, UK, Farai, PhD in Political Science from
Queen Mary University of London, "A call for abolition: The disavowal
and displacement of race in critical security studies", CS)

The problem with this move of displacement is that [the ethico-political
stance of reparation is necessarily an affirmative one.]{.underline} As
Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick (2003: 150--151) suggests[, it is through this
displacement that we can learn from the 'ways selves and communities
succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture -- even
of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain
them]{.underline}'. As Tiffany Lethabo King powerfully argues, while it
is the case that reading 'for what is generative and provides openings'
(King, 2019: 230n74) is vital for coalition and collaboration,
reparative work advocated in LGBT and queer theory presupposes the
positionality of a shared humanist sexual subject position. As Fred
Moten (2018: 11--12) notes in his essay on race and the work of Levinas,
[the reparative stance of being 'open to the world' or 'available to the
world' can only work as a critical project for those for whom the world
is accessible in these ways. For those structurally excluded from this
political ontology of the subject, this openness would be critical only
insofar as relationality is understood to be an expression of
power]{.underline}, structured by the givenness of a transcendental
subjectivity that the black cannot have but by which the black can be
had; a [structural position that he or she cannot take but by which he
or she can be taken]{.underline}. (Moten, 2018: 204) [Any project of
reparative work for generative ethico-political openings would have to
be undertaken after the abolition or dismantling of critical security
studies, not as a substitute for this, displacing the problem to that of
the repair of the disciplinary field]{.underline}. Reparative work
proffered from within a system where race is not merely the 'oil' in the
engine but the engine itself offers little hope of real change. How can
critical security studies offer a space for a new antiracist political
ethics, from within the wider 'prison of colonial modernity' (Blaney and
Tickner, 2017)? Surely, if reparative work is to be undertaken, it
should be carried out on the terms of those who are wronged, rather than
on the grounds of the perpetrator of the offence. [If critical security
studies exists on the ground of the 'human', as a science of the
humanity from which Blackness has always been excluded, then it cannot
ameliorate the oppression that was required to clear that
ground]{.underline} (Wynter, 2003). Instead, we might follow Alexander
Weheliye (2014: 137) in arguing that humanity, the idea of the 'human',
can only be overhauled from without, transformed by those who, he
argues, 'live behind the veil of the permanent state of exception'.
Thus, we might argue that [reparation ultimately leads us back to
subjection]{.underline} (see Coulthard, 2007: 453). '[Questions of race
and racism' are not the spectre haunting critical security studies, they
are its life blood, its arteries and the muscles that power it. Critical
security studies can have no reparative access to 'questions of race and
racism' no matter how hard or how genuinely it tries. 'Questions of race
and racism' are what enable the cuts and binaries, the world, the
subjects, the concerns, the practices, the methods, the understandings
of critical security studies.]{.underline} Critical. Security. Studies.
What is it about these three words, singularly, together, in whatever
order, that could make anyone think, in today's world, there was a way
beyond their imbrications in 'questions of race and racism'? Critical of
what? On what grounds? Security of what? On what grounds? Study of what?
On what grounds? Answer: the grounds of anti-Blackness or 'questions of
race and racism'.

#### Resistance DA: Modern IR theory was created to ensure that [resistance]{.underline} is [ontologically impossible]{.underline}\-\--the only [critiques]{.underline} that they allow are those that uphold the current [system]{.underline}

**Van Milders and Toros 20**(Lucas, Assistant Professor in Critical
Security Studies at the University of Groningen, Harmonie, Deputy
Director of Institute of Cyber Security for Society (iCSS) at University
of Kent, "Violent International Relations", CS)

This has also left a mark on the dynamics of knowledge production. Our
conceptualisation [of 'the other side of the line' is always determined
by Western epistemology's abyssal thinking,]{.underline} that is, the
colonial matrix of knowledge production (Santos, 2007). In other words[,
this messy cartography is predicated on the assumption that those within
the zone of nonbeing cannot speak or think]{.underline} (Spivak, 1994).
[The hierarchy between rational, objective and universal knowledge and
irrational, subjective and particular experience continues to operate
through Orientalist conceptions about who knows and who is known or who
produces knowledge and who produces experience.]{.underline} In short,
[the violence of colonial difference constitutes the Western, academic
knowledge worker, whether they work strictly within disciplinary
boundaries or an interdisciplinary fashion.]{.underline} And this brings
us to the second question: what does this mean for knowledge production
in IR? Here we point to [the ontological gap between knowledge and
experience that has recently been articulated as a critique of the role
of the expert as an Orientalist subject (]{.underline}Kynsilehto and
Puumala, 2015; Sylvester, 2011, 2012, 2013). Indeed, [the
'international' nature of IR and of its scholars make the discipline a
'frontline' discipline that often resides in practices along the abyssal
lines between the zones of being and nonbeing. This is caused by the
object of enquiry of the discipline]{.underline} -- formally the power
relations between states but, as is increasingly recognised, [the power
relations between people.]{.underline} It is also caused by the
practices of the discipline -- [the need to perform the role and
lifestyle of the international expert for research, dissemination and
increasingly impact.]{.underline} There are many ways in which this is
distributed across the discipline, yet what the [iterations of
disciplinary violence in IR tend to have in common is a further
proliferation of the limits of IR as essentially an abyssal
line]{.underline}. This concerns, for instance, the decadent or
disciplinary nature of mainstream IR, widely critiqued elsewhere (such
as in Ashley and Walker, 1990 and Weber, 2014 to name but two separated
by decades). However, [critical strands of IR theory might
have]{.underline}, despite their efficacy at exposing the violence
performed by mainstream IR, implicitly (and presumably undeliberately)
[contributed to the image of the critical theorist as an expert or
intellectual, characterised by the privilege to withdraw politically and
theorise both systemically as well as globally]{.underline} (Linklater,
1996). This image subsequently solicits and naturalises a range of
[theoretical inquiries]{.underline} that not only stem from the zone of
being but also, as mentioned above, [continue to demarcate an abyssal
line around the discipline. This has]{.underline}, in recent years,
[allowed for the continued support for Western military violence in
post-colonial states, even when such instances have had disastrous
effects]{.underline} (see debate between Dunne and Gelber, 2014, Hehir,
2015, and again Dunne and Gelber, 2015 as well as the critique of
feminist support for war in Afghanistan in Wibben, 2011). [The violent
nature of IR is also evident from its inclusion of non-Western forms of
theory]{.underline} (typically presented as reactionary and
anti-Western) [on the premise that they do not challenge the
discipline's inherently Western epistemology]{.underline} (Buzan, 2018).
[The violence of IR theory is then characterised by its capacity and
often willingness to maintain relations of both material as well as
epistemic coloniality]{.underline}.

### AT: Perm Do The Aff Through The Lens

#### [Trivializing]{.underline} race in IR as the background to "[important]{.underline}" security policies only serves to further [cement]{.underline} racism in the [system]{.underline} 

**Howell and Richter-Montpetit 20**(Alison, Associate Professor of
Political Science at Rutgers University, Melanie, Senior Lecturer in
International Relations and Director of the Centre for Advanced
International Theory, "Is securitization theory racist? Civilizationism,
methodological whiteness, and antiblack thought in the Copenhagen
School", CS)

This article has illustrated that [classic securitization theory is
structured not only by Eurocentrism, but also by civilizationism,
methodological whiteness, and antiblack racism]{.underline}. This is
evident in its conception of politics, borrowed from Arendt, which it
defines as [a sphere of (white) civilized dialogue where reason triumphs
over irrational securitizations.]{.underline} [This perspective is only
made possible by ignoring colonial history, ongoing (settler-)colonial
relations, and the racial violence of normal liberal
politics.]{.underline} Securitization theory's racism is also evident in
its methodology, which examines securitizing speech acts in order to
defend this (European, civilized) 'normal politics'. Under cover of
ostensibly neutral terms, [securitization normatively prioritizes the
defense of order over justice, positioning the securitization theorist
as the defender of (white) civilized politics against (racialized)
'primal anarchy'.]{.underline} We have further demonstrated the role of
antiblack thought in securitization theory: its racist imaginaries of
Africa serve as an indispensable foil, setting up a contrast between
normal politics and securitization. One question beyond the scope of
this article is whether this is similarly true of 'second-generation'
and more empirical applications of securitization theory -- or, indeed,
the mere use of the word 'securitization'. [Postcolonial literature has
long deliberated whether it is possible to rework theories built on
racist precepts.]{.underline} For example, vigorous debate has
surrounded whether the works of Marx (Coulthard, 2014; Rao, 2017;
Robinson, 1983) or Foucault (Mbembe, 2003; Stoler, 1995; Thobani, 2007)
can be adapted and made to work for anti-racist/anti-colonial purposes.
Are there 'reparative possibilities' (Sedgwick, 1997; in relation to
international relations, see Rao, 2017) for classic securitization
theory? Can it excise or surmount its racist foundations? Our analysis
suggests that [securitization theory's racism is not an incidental
feature, nor 'merely' a matter of (empirical) application. Rather, it is
baked into securitization theory's conceptual apparatus and, in
particular, its core concepts of politics and security. These problems
cannot be remedied by applying classic securitization theory to
non-Western spaces]{.underline} (as typically suggested by critics of
its Eurocentrism), [or by simply adding race or colonialism to its
accounts]{.underline}. The retention of securitization theory's concepts
and methods leads to a primary focus on instances of overtly racist
speech acts. [Global racism is then treated as a matter of mere
language. This elides the constitutive role of racist and colonial
relations of force and expropriation in the making of the modern order,
including ongoing security projects]{.underline} (see Howell and
Richter-Montpetit, 2019). [Once classic securitization theory is
stripped of its racist conceptual and methodological
apparatus,]{.underline} including its concepts of 'normal politics', its
conservative deployment of speech act theory, its view of excessive
securitization as threatening a racially encoded lower level of
civilization, its faith in the social contract, and so on, [there is
very little left]{.underline}. Perhaps what remains is simply the word
'[securitization']{.underline}. But even this word [is potentially
problematic, because inherent in it is a temporal move from normal
politics towards the (exceptional) violence of security.]{.underline}
[Authors attempting to recuperate the term 'securitization' must take
care not to indulge in white nostalgia for a better, more innocent
time]{.underline}: a time that does not exist for those who have been
subject to colonialism or the racial contract on scales from the local
to the global -- that is to say, the majority of the world's people.
[Such a recuperative intellectual project, if at all possible, has yet
to be articulated.]{.underline}

### Critiquing Western Scholarship Fails

#### Sweeping critiques of Western colonialism [buttress]{.underline} the status quo.

**Vickers, 20**---Professor of Comparative Education at Kyushu
University (Edward, "Critiquing coloniality, 'epistemic violence' and
western hegemony in comparative education -- the dangers of ahistoricism
and positionality," Comparative Education, 56:2, 165-189, dml)
\[gendered language modifications denoted by brackets\]

The central flaw in the argument advanced by the CER authors stems from
an apparent lack of awareness of contemporary scholarship on the
comparative history of imperialism and colonialism. [Criticism of the
Eurocentric assumptions that inform much mainstream social science is
**certainly warranted**, as is critique of the excessive influence
exerted by institutions]{.underline} such as key journals based [in
North America or Europe]{.underline}. [However, when critical arguments
rely on **selective** and **historically flimsy** claims for the
**uniquely colonial quality** of modern Western culture, the risks
are]{.underline} twofold: firstly, and fundamentally, actually [to
**sustain** or **reinforce Eurocentrism** by deflecting the critical
gaze from non-Western societies and the patterns of oppression
('colonial' or otherwise) therein; and]{.underline} secondly, by the
same token [to **weaken** or **discredit** the case for a more inclusive
and culturally sensitive approach to]{.underline} the [comparative
analysis]{.underline} of education.

The empirical and theoretical flaws of this approach are intertwined
with the problematic language in which its arguments are typically
couched. [Historical and anthropological scholarship on East Asia and
other regions **amply demonstrates** that colonialist or neo-colonialist
attitudes and strategies of [domination]{.mark} are **not** and [**have
never been** a Western monopoly]{.mark}. But [decolonial theory]{.mark}
posits the more or less **uniform** victimhood of non-Western 'others,'
deriving claims for the moral superiority of '**authentically**'
indigenous perspectives. **Debating the validity** of such claims [is
**complicated** by]{.mark} an emphasis on '[**positionality**.'
Readers]{.mark} are exhorted to **[judge]{.mark} an [argument]{.mark}**
[less by]{.mark} standards of **[evidence]{.mark}** or **logic** (often
portrayed as camouflaging a Western '**will to power**') [than]{.mark}
on the basis of the writer's]{.underline} self-identification or
[['**positioning**.' The language of '**epistemic
violence**,']{.underline}]{.mark} 'secure spaces,' ['**epistemological
diffidence**,' '**border thinking**' and 'location' [suggests]{.mark} an
image of [the]{.mark} critical [scholar as **revolutionary**]{.mark}
**guerrilla**, **valiantly sniping** at Western hegemony
from]{.underline} his or her [\[their\] marginal redoubt]{.underline}.
In so far as this reflects a desire for a more just, tolerant and
sustainable society -- one that values diversity as a resource for
mutual learning -- it is admirable. However, [if we seek to combat
oppression, in the educational sphere or beyond, [it is
incumbent]{.mark} on us [to **pick**]{.mark} **our [enemies]{.mark}**,
and our **language**, [**carefully**. Aiming a **blunderbuss**
at]{.mark} the supposedly illegitimate or self-serving 'universalism' of
'modern [Western]{.mark} social [science,' while **ignoring**
how]{.mark} calls for indigenisation and ['authenticity']{.mark} are
used to **[legitimate]{.mark} highly [oppressive regimes]{.mark}**
across Asia and elsewhere, is to [risk **undermining**]{.mark} those
universal social and political [values]{.mark}]{.underline} (freedom of
expression, civil liberties, rule of law) [[upon which]{.mark}
**critical [scholars]{.mark} themselves [rely]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[An [embrace of]{.mark} '**opacity**' or '[**epistemological
diffidence**,']{.mark}]{.underline} advocated by several of the CER
contributors, [[threatens to be]{.mark} **similarly
[self-defeating]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While they share an admiration
for the Argentine theorist of 'decoloniality,' Walter Mignolo, the work
of his brilliant compatriot, the writer, poet and essayist Jorge Luis
Borges, is far worthier of attention. Borges' famous fondness for
'labyrinths' and the paradoxical was combined with a sharp eye for
gratuitous obfuscation and circumlocution (see, for example, his story
The Aleph, in Borges 1998, 274--286). Offering his own critique of the
fashion for opaque jargon in mainstream social science, the émigré
Polish sociologist Stanislav Andreski wrote acerbically that 'one of the
pleasures obtainable through recourse to confusion and absurdity is to
be able to feel, and publicly to claim, that one knows when in reality
one does not' (1974, 95). ['Opacity']{.underline} in imaginative
literature [may **intrigue** or **entertain**, but in **interpreting**
and **explaining**]{.underline} unfamiliar societies, cultures and
education [systems]{.underline}, [comparativists especially ought to
write in **clear**, **accessible language**. And while all social
scientists can understand the lure of the **sweeping generalisation**,
we should generalise with **extreme caution**, especially when
categorising large swathes of humanity]{.underline}.

Borges' earliest collection of stories is entitled A Universal History
of Iniquity. This appeared in 1935, when there were already rumblings in
both East and West of the conflict that would soon engulf Eurasia.
Implied in his title was a truth painfully obvious to many
contemporaries: that iniquity is indeed universal. The conflicts of the
mid-twentieth century starkly illuminated another truth: that iniquity
in the modern world, especially (though not only) that associated with
totalitarian societies, often consists in essentialising and
de-humanising 'the other'. Hannah Arendt -- a thoroughly Eurocentric
thinker, but one who addressed, in 'totalitarianism,' a theme with
global ramifications -- wrote of how, through 'the murder of the moral
person in man,' totalitarian systems transform their citizens into
'living corpses' capable of any outrage (2017, 591). But ironically,
[[in]{.mark} the **very act of [attacking essentialism]{.mark}** as
applied to 'non-Western' cultures]{.underline}, the CER
[[contributors]{.mark} propagate an **[essentialise]{.mark}d view** of
'[the West']{.mark} itself. Iniquity in the form of [coloniality
is]{.mark}]{.underline} in their account [[attributed **solely** to
West]{.mark}ern modernity. [This]{.mark} view [is]{.mark} both
[**inaccurate** and **dangerous**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The irony]{.underline} in this approach [extends to the attribution of
**agency**. [Claims to champion the]{.mark} dignity of
[subaltern]{.mark}, 'non-Western' actors [are]{.mark} in fact
[**undermined** by assertions of]{.mark} their **uniform
[victimhood]{.mark}**. This **reproduces** the very Eurocentrism that
'decolonial' scholars quite rightly seek to challenge]{.underline}. In
fact, [privilege and victimhood have **many dimensions**, **[by no
means]{.mark} all [traceable]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the '**phenomenon of
colossal vagueness**' that is [colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Osterhammel 2005, 4). [One group or individual can plausibly be
portrayed as **victim**, or **perpetrator**, or **both**, depending on
**context** and **perspective**. Were post-war German civilian refugees
from Eastern Europe, or Japanese civilians fleeing Manchuria, victims or
perpetrators?]{.underline} Or today, is a privately-educated,
English-speaking, upper-caste South Asian scholar more accurately to be
seen as privileged or under-privileged, in terms of access to power
('epistemic' or otherwise) within South Asia or the global academy?
['Location' or identity are **not reducible** to neat labels or discrete
categories]{.underline}. As the Anglo-Ghanaian philosopher Kwame Anthony
Appiah emphasises, [according dignity and agency involves recognising
that our identities are not just **socially given**, but also **actively
chosen**]{.underline}. Culture is 'a process you join, in living a life
with others,' and 'the values that European humanists like to espouse
belong as much to an African or an Asian who takes them up with
enthusiasm as to a European' (2018, 211). [The same applies with respect
to value systems we have reason to regard as **iniquitous**, such as
those associated with **colonialism** or **neoliberalism**]{.underline}.

What, then, are we to make of the traction that totalising
anti-Westernism appears to be gaining within the CIE field? On one
level, this may tell us more about the state of campus politics, and
politics in general, across contemporary America and the broader
'Anglosphere', than about the wider world. The worldview that the CER
contributors espouse, even as they strain at the shackles of Western
epistemology, is redolent of America's peculiarly racialised identity
politics. And [notwithstanding claims to marginal positionality,
[the]{.mark} **increasingly widespread [currency]{.mark}** [of such
arguments]{.mark}]{.underline} in North American and Anglophone CIE
circles [reflects their status as an emergent orthodoxy that in key
respects **[mirrors]{.mark}** the very [ethnocentrism]{.mark} it
rejects]{.underline}.

[Although the ideas]{.underline} in the CER special issue [are presented
as **challenging** both the scholarly mainstream and a wider neoliberal
or neocolonial establishment, the seriousness of this challenge is
**doubtful**. [Exhortations to]{.mark} embrace '**opacity**' or to
['**think otherwise**']{.mark} in the name of 'contesting coloniality'
imply **no coherent programme**, and [suggest a]{.mark}n
**overwhelmingly [negative agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Meanwhile,
[**far** from risking ostracism, the contributors can expect **warm
endorsement** of their views from regulars at]{.underline} the major
international [conferences. For many]{.underline} in the CIE community
in North America and beyond, [sweeping critiques of Western 'hegemony',
'coloniality' and so forth hold a **strong appeal**; it is those seeking
to **question** the balance or accuracy of such theorising who risk
**opprobrium**]{.underline}. As Merquior wrote of Foucault, Derrida and
their postmodernist or 'deconstructivist' followers, their 'skepsis',
'highly placed in the core institutions of the culture it so strives to
undermine,' has come to constitute an 'official marginality' (1991,
160).

[The]{.underline} potential -- and actual -- [consequences]{.underline}
of this [are **troubling**]{.underline}. Takayama et al call for the
WCCES in particular to embrace the agenda of '[contesting
coloniality]{.underline},' but one conclusion to be drawn from recent
events is that this [is **already happening**, with **damaging
consequences**]{.underline} for civility within the Comparative
Education field, and [for the **wider credibility** of]{.underline} its
[scholarly output]{.underline}.15 [[Reducing scholarship to]{.mark} the
projection of the scholar's own [positionality]{.mark} can only [lead to
**fragmentation** and **irrelevance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To quote
Merquior again (paraphrasing Hilary Putnam), '[[to **demote
rationality**]{.mark}, in a relativist way, to a mere concoction of a
given historical culture [is]{.mark} as **[reductionist]{.mark}** as the
logical positivist's reduction of reason to scientific
calculus]{.underline}' (160). What he calls the 'Elixir of Pure
[[Negation]{.underline}']{.mark} (159) is an intoxicating brew, but it
[[is **unlikely to**]{.mark} **inspire coherent** or **constructive
contributions** to [addres]{.mark}sing the pressing problems of our age:
**[climate]{.mark} change**, [**poverty**, **inequality** and]{.mark}
the **ethical [crisis]{.mark}** that underpins them all]{.underline}.

Indeed, [[it]{.mark} is **very likely to [do the opposite]{.mark}**. The
**neoliberal cadres** of the OECD or World Bank, along with
**nationalist autocrats** from Beijing to Budapest, will be **more than
happy** for 'critical scholars' to fulminate against a
**vaguely-defined** 'West' while embracing 'epistemological
diffidence']{.underline} (Takayama, Sriprakash, and Connell 2017, S18).
As one critic of 'postmodernism' has put it, [the promotion of
'**epistemological pluralism**,' combined with **rejection** of any
'**settled external viewpoint**,' means that, 'so far as **real-life
ongoing politics** is concerned,']{.underline} postmodernists, along
with de-constructivists, [[decolonialists]{.underline}]{.mark} and their
ilk, [[tend to be]{.mark} '**passively [conservative]{.mark}** in
effect']{.underline} (Butler 2002, 61). If 'decoloniality' promotes a
balkanisation of the Comparative Education field into identitybased
cliques that prize 'opacity,' [the risk is that [in practice]{.mark}
this will only serve [to **buttress the s**]{.mark}**tatus
[quo]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Researching and debating IR teaches [critical inquiry]{.underline} that spills out [beyond the classroom]{.underline}---it's [not]{.underline} inevitably elitist or Eurocentric.

[The [first benefit is]{.mark}]{.underline} generating [a **well-trained
[pipeline]{.mark}** [of future IR scholars and practitioners]{.mark}.
Today's students are the [**scholars** and **practitioners of
tomorrow**]{.mark}, and sparking **curiosity** in students, especially
**[undergraduates]{.mark}**, has the potential to **[rejuvenate]{.mark}
the [field]{.mark}** [from within]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Hagmann and
Biersteker (2014, 292--293) argue[, [IR scholars]{.underline}]{.mark}
[should "[take]{.mark} a **more [direct interest]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} how world politics is explained to [[students
in everyday schooling practices]{.underline}]{.mark}." This is eminently
sensible. International relations' [[preoccupation]{.mark}
with]{.underline} "the cult of research intensivity" (Nossal 2006, 737),
and to a lesser extent [[political practice]{.underline},
**[misleads]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the [professoriate]{.mark} into
believing that the very people who sustain universities as institutions
and who are the future of the discipline---[student]{.mark}
subscribers---[can be **ignored**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [It
has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[led the IR professoriate to
**undervalue**]{.underline}]{.mark} the contribution that the taught
discipline makes to disciplinary renewal through [the [**training**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elation[s']{.underline} [next
[generation]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[For future practitioners, whether in **government** or **elsewhere**,
an [IR education provides]{.mark} the [**conceptual architecture**
needed to **make decisions**]{.mark} about policy and its place in the
world]{.underline}. In his memoirs, Henry Kissinger emphasizes this
point: "The convictions that leaders have formed before reaching high
office are the intellectual capital they will consume as long as they
continue in office. There is little time for leaders to reflect" (as
quoted in Desch 2019, 153). While Kissinger is talking about the highest
level of elected office, it is equally true that [policymakers
throughout government come in equipped with the **intellectual capital**
and **technical skills** learned in the classroom]{.underline} (Biswas
and Paczynska 2015). [For future scholars, early lessons have
**downstream effects** on the very content of IR knowledge]{.underline}.
After all, [the [classroom is where IR theory gets reproduced "**for the
first time**" to future generations of IR scholars]{.mark}]{.underline}.
As Newsom (1995, 64--65) put [it]{.underline}, "\[t\]eachers [**[plant
the seeds]{.mark}** that shape the thinking of each new generation; this
is]{.underline} probably [the academic world's **most lasting
[contribution]{.mark}**]{.underline}[."]{.mark} [It is also a place
where the durability and centrality of the field's major theories are
reinforced as a matter of course and **not necessarily for the
better**]{.underline} (Vitalis 2015, 6). [Early undergraduates **carry**
the assumptions they are taught **throughout** their undergraduate and
graduate careers, and **beyond**. A [discipline that **cannot connect**
with students]{.mark} or is inward-looking and esoteric risks **pu[tting
off]{.mark}** [its next generation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, [the
classroom needs to be treated with **greater regard** as a site of
**knowledge production** and **dissemination** in the intellectual life
of the field]{.underline}. In this sense, [curiosity can be provoked
among students that may continue **beyond** an undergraduate
career]{.underline}. Take, for example, the observation of one student
on her intellectual awakening in the classroom:

Despite a Eurocentric and male-dominated ethos, what ultimately
convinced me to stay in IR was my exposure and inability to detach from
what was first described to me as the politics of the "postcolonial." A
lecturer holding up a roughened paperback copy of Edward Said's 1979
acclaimed work Orientalism originally introduced me to
postcolonialism...Hearing Said's words being reiterated back to me in my
predominately white and conservative-leaning lecture theater was a
defining moment in my education. Orientalism provided an experience that
I could finally connect with: one where political power was not about
who had the most weaponry or democracy, but instead about who held
political control over the reality of the racialized person (Abu-Bakare
2017).

The moment captured in this tableau is the [[intellectual
awakening]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[is possible]{.mark}
when]{.underline} pedagogy is carefully considered. From [the
student]{.underline} perspective, well-taught courses
**[prepare]{.underline}** them better [for the next stage in their
education, [starting with **superior foundational
training**]{.mark}]{.underline} at the early undergraduate levels [and
[progressing to **improved research capabilities** and **substantive
knowledg**]{.mark}**e**]{.underline} at the higher undergraduate levels,
and then to advanced skills training in graduate school. [Well-trained
cohorts]{.underline} coming up the ranks [will be **highly proficient**
in a **wider range** of IR topics, theories, ideas, and methods and will
be **well prepared** to make the jump to fluency]{.underline}.
Similarly, [future practitioners will be equipped with **superior
substantive** and **technical training**]{.underline}. This is
especially true with "experiential learning." Done in purposeful ways,
learning through experiences outside the classroom generates employable
skills for students.

Social and Institutional Context of Teaching and Disciplinary
Reproduction

Directly related to the question of the future of international
relations is the social context of teaching and the discipline's
reproduction in the classroom. IR [scholars must recognize that the [IR
classroom is the site of **ideational preferences**]{.mark}, clashes of
**favored** or **disfavored paradigms**, of **personal
authority**]{.underline}, generational difference, [**social
privileges**, and **prejudices**. At **every point** in]{.underline}
professional [i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations, [there
are implications for how knowledge is **produced**, **taught**, and
**passed on**]{.underline} (Ettinger 2016; Colgan 2017; Fattore 2018;
Knight 2019). Indeed, [the intellectual output of IR scholars does not
exist independent of the **lived context** in which it is
produced]{.underline}. Gaining insight into the social context of
international relations' taught discipline can help begin to correct the
pathologies that are affecting the way the next generation of IR
scholars are being taught right now and how future scholars and
practitioners will be taught next year and beyond.

It begins by addressing the social identity of the instructor and how it
contributes to the reproduction of IR knowledge. After all, the
instructor does not speak from a position of nowhere and an account of
IR pedagogy should address the personal features of the instructor, her
place within the discipline's division of labor, and its effect on the
delivery of course content (Biswas and Deylami 2017). For international
relations especially, it is the site of entrenched male and
Euro-Atlantic dominance with cascading implications within the classroom
and beyond. The 2014 TRIP survey shows that the global IR professorate
is two-thirds male (Maliniak et al. 2014). In the United States and
British IR "core" and in the Anglo "noncore" (Cox and Nossal 2009), the
professoriate is overwhelmingly white and male. Australia is 72.11
percent male and 76.87 percent white. Canada is 70.83 percent male and
83.4 percent white. The United Kingdom is 64.83 percent male and 85.23
percent white, while the United States is 68.33 percent male and 85.21
percent white non-Hispanic. New Zealand, a slight outlier, is 81.82
percent male but only 34.78 percent identifying as NZ European (Maliniak
et al. 2014). Given what has been shown about the American dominance of
the discipline, the insularity of national IR communities, and the
gender gap in citations, it is reasonable to conclude that the bulk of
the most influential IR scholarship is produced and disseminated by
white men in the West (Maliniak et al. 2018; Maliniak et al 2013).

Understanding this relationship can improve IR pedagogy by recognizing
how diverse student populations interact with an overwhelmingly white
Euro-Atlantic intellectual tradition and by remedying some of the
attending limitations such as geohistorical narrowness, state-centrism,
epistemological positivism, and phallocentric authorship (Fonseca 2019).
In this regard, the taught discipline of international relations should
be intellectually responsive to a diversifying discipline and to a
diversifying student population. Such circumstances call for a broader
approach to teaching courses in a field whose heavy Euro-American
centrality can alienate students when their backgrounds are not
reflected in the course material. This is not simply a matter of
curriculum design that tries to mirror or "look like" the students
(Appiah 2019, SR7). Rather, it is one that balances disciplinary
foundations with broadened ontological scope of what "matters" in IR in
order to generate betterinformed teaching. It is widely recognized that
international relations is a very traditional field of scholarship, but
this should not preclude perspectives beyond the canon or case studies
from outside the empirical mainstream. More ambitious and, especially,
diverse content helps adapt teaching to changing student audiences. This
is especially true at the undergraduate level. What is important to
avoid is the "pipeline problem" that has discouraged women and
minorities from progressing through the scholarly ranks in STEM fields
(Brown et al. 2016; Branch 2016). By the same token, bringing more and
more diverse young students into the discipline of international
relations and encouraging their growth can bear intellectual fruit down
the line. At very least, we avoid artificially restricting the
development of the next generation of scholars.

[By [**no means** is this a call to **jettison** the
classics]{.mark}]{.underline}. To the contrary, [[the field's canon is
**irreplaceable** as a foundation, as the **intellectual inheritance**
of the present, as the **prevailing ideas** of foreign policymakers,
and]{.mark} as **points of [disagreement]{.mark}** for critical
traditions]{.underline}. However, [the scope of IR pedagogy can be
**[expanded]{.mark}**]{.underline} to make it relevant for a
twenty-first century classroom. Primarily, this means expanding the
theoretical and empirical scope of international relations
[**[beyond]{.mark}** its traditional **Eurocentric** and
[**male-dominated** parameters]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(Acharya
2016). This is discussed below. Granted, there will be no singular
population to which an IR curriculum will be pitched. Variation in
student population profiles based on race, gender, class, geography, and
other identity markers complicate the decisions that an instructor has
to make. The point is that there are intellectual gains to be had when
the taught discipline takes seriously the social context of
international relations' disciplinary reproduction. With a more diverse
pedagogy in place, it is possible that, with more eyes on the subject
matter and more minds from different backgrounds at work, [the IR
classroom can generate greater interest in **fundamental theoretical
questions** for the next generation of scholars to solve]{.underline}.

Institutional context of teaching matters too. The vast majority of IR
practice takes place in university institutions. Therefore, the material
institutional setting must enter in as a condition of international
relations' intellectual life. Consider first, the matter of basic
institutional survival. In an era where public universities around the
world face funding problems, there are immediate economic imperatives
for taking the taught discipline of international relations seriously.
In the short term, survival in unforgiving economic times requires
student enrollment and retention (Conley 2019). Systematic accounts of
US undergraduate enrollment since the Great Recession of 2008 show
majors in the "traditional disciplines" declining by 21 percent
(philosophy) to 30 percent (history). Political science and
international relations fare less badly, declining "only" by 11 percent
and 15 percent over ten years (Schmidt 2018). Put differently, the
classroom is on the front line in the battle for resources. Student
recruitment and retention are essential to the economic viability of
academic departments including political science and international
relations. Turning students off the subject matter through an
unreflexive pedagogy, boring classes, or mediocre lecturers has real
economic implications for the future. Without students prepared to part
with tuition dollars, or governments prepared to unlock activity-based
funding, no department can thrive, even with a roster of productive
researchers. Concretely, this means no new hiring and reduced budgets---
a recipe for contraction. In this context, the systematic neglect of the
classroom by IR stocktakers is entirely inexplicable given the parlous
financial state of most public universities. Trends in expanded
enrollment compound or create new problems. Universities that pack
classrooms with hundreds, if not thousands, of more students---many of
whom are international and pay exorbitant tuition fees---put revenue
generation above pedagogy (Schulmann 2019).

The disciplinary division of university labor must be factored into an
understanding of the context of IR teaching and its implications for the
intellectual life of international relations. In this sense, debate
about the taught discipline must grapple with question of resources,
division of university labor, teaching assignments, pressures of the
tenure track, the precarity of contract faculty, and other aspects of
university governance as conditions that influence the classroom. One of
the most striking trends in university governance is the increasing role
of contingent instructors. In the United States, some 73 percent of
instructional positions were nontenure track in 2016 (AAUP 2018). This
is consistent with longer-term trends. The percentage of postsecondary
instructional positions filled by contingent faculty increased from 57.6
percent in 1995 to 71.6 percent in 2011. In that time, the number of
full-time tenure-track positions increased by 10 percent while the
number of full- or part-time contingent positions doubled (GAO 2017,
8--9). This is not to say that contingent faculty are worse teachers,
but the contingent nature of the work creates impediments to teaching.
Fewer institutional resources, the constant need to reapply for jobs,
and the need for part-time work outside the university are all matters
that detract from time dedicated to students, improving pedagogy, or
learning new content. Downstream, the design of an IR class or the
delivery of an IR curriculum may not be nearly as effective as it could
be.

Intellectual Reflection and Renewal from the Inside Out

Taking teaching seriously as part of [the intellectual life of
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations [can]{.underline}
lead to intellectual renewal and self-reflection for individual
professors and for the discipline as a whole. At the individual level,
teaching has the ability to [catalyze an **intellectual
renewal**]{.underline} in the mind of the individual professor. [The
intellectual challenges of the classroom can provoke **[new avenues of
research]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the instructor. [The classroom is a
**much more permissive intellectual environment** than academic
publishing. It affords]{.underline} the professor [a degree of freedom
to **explore topics**, **ideas**, and **arguments**, outside of their
research expertise. Making use of the opportunity to teach beyond one's
[comfort zone permits **thinking out loud**, **working through ideas**,
and **entanglement in analytical puzzles**. Doing so is demanding, and
it is much easier to fall back on existing]{.mark}]{.underline} teaching
[[content]{.mark}. But an ambitious]{.underline} teaching [agenda can
lead to **new research questions**, **new** and **unexpected
intellectual horizons**, and **better background context** for existing
expertise]{.underline}. Indeed, there is truth to the aphorism that
there is no better way to learn than to teach.

[This kind of renewal turns on the "**eureka**" moment when research
ideas **flows directly** from classroom activities]{.underline}. A more
systematic approach to renewal that is less reliant on serendipity
begins by asking discipline-wide questions. The first is this: what is
the purpose of teaching international relations? It is a variation on a
core concern to the discipline and one that remains unresolved (Dyvik,
Wilkinson, and Selby 2017)? Is it for disciplinary self-reproduction, to
train future practitioners, or more broadly, citizens and knowledge
workers in the twenty-first century economy (Darling and Foster 2012;
Szarejko and Carnes 2018; Zartner et al. 2018)? [Arriving at an official
"purpose" for i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations [is
probably **pointless**]{.underline}, and it is best left to the
decentralized community of scholars to decide. IR scholars have debated
this question widely within the published discipline but far less so in
the taught discipline. This is a shame because the answers matter for
the nature of the design of individual courses and entire degree
programs.

Just like the published discipline, the taught discipline is radically
decentralized in universities around the world, subnational variations,
department-level programs, and individual scholar's preferences. Thus,
it is incumbent on individual professors to give an answer in their own
teaching programs. At the individual level, answering the question about
the purpose of teaching international relations should outfit students
with an answer to what they are about to encounter and why this topic,
course, or degree program is worth pursuing. Students, especially early
undergraduate students, need to know why they are about to be presented
with the complicated theory and obscure events that are core (or
peripheral) to [the IR discipline]{.underline}. Answers are generously
supplied in the introduction chapters to IR textbooks but the suite of
options betrays a lack of focus that is symptomatic of the wider field
(Albert 2010). However, [this permissive intellectual environment is
beneficial for **wide-ranging intellectual pursuits**, **teaching
styles**, and **pedagogical agendas**]{.underline}. [It
**may**]{.underline}, though, [come at the cost]{.underline}. The
institutional underpinnings [of]{.underline} the discipline---faculty
administrators, editorial boards, funding agencies, hiring committees,
and so on--- may end up doing as much to shape the boundaries of the
discipline as the substantive output (Albert and Buzan 2017, 908). The
alternative, though, is subjecting intellectual and academic freedom to
[an **institutionalized orthodoxy**]{.underline}. In teaching,
decentralization may be intellectually permissive but may come at the
expense of disciplinary coherence.

[This concern]{.underline}, though, [may be **overstated**]{.underline}.
TRIP **[data]{.underline}** on curriculum design [gives an indication of
the **competing** and sometimes **overlapping pedagogical
priorities**]{.underline} among the IR professoriate. In a question on
introduction to IR classes, respondents were asked whether their
introductory courses are designed more to introduce IR scholarship
within the discipline or to prepare students to be informed about
foreign policy and international issues. The result favors a mix of both
with 80.83 percent incorporating scholarship and issues in some balance.
The remaining 19.17 percent come down in favor of one to the exclusion
of the other. At the master's level, the ratio is a bit narrower (73 to
27 percent) but still overwhelmingly embraces a mixture of academic
scholarship and international issues (Maliniak et al. 2014). Respondents
are a bit more divided on what undergraduate courses should be mandatory
in an IR program. They overwhelmingly agree (73.25 percent) that IR
theory should be a required subject. However, they differ on other
options. The next most popular candidates for a required course are
international/global political economy (45.37 percent), international
security (38.87 percent), and research methods (35.22 percent), followed
by international organizations (27.59 percent), comparative foreign
policy (22.86 percent), home country foreign policy (19.95 percent),
international law (19.85 percent), diplomatic history (19.11 percent),
and international economics (15.17 percent) (Maliniak et al. 2014). The
point is that [resolving what IR teaching is supposed to accomplish is
**hardly settled**]{.underline}, but there is some convergence on
certain issues.

So, [what]{.underline} then, [is the purpose of teaching
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations? Ultimately, it is up
to the individual instructor to answer and to enact a program
accordingly. But [[it is up to the community of scholars to
**debate**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It may well be that the enormous
variation in the purpose of teaching international relations and the
radical decentralization is an inescapable feature of the taught
discipline. [[Though IR teaching may be **wildly
divergent**]{.underline}]{.mark} around the world, [there [is **always
some purpose**]{.mark} to it, and]{.underline}, however defined, [this
is an **intrinsic feature** of an i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elations [education]{.underline}. Here, Cox's (1981, 128)
famous admonition that "[theory is **always for someone** and **for some
purpose**]{.underline}" serves as the anchor concept for
[such]{.underline} pedagogical [framing]{.underline}. It [frames IR
theories as **political things** and **not just abstractions** to be
memorized or an **[analytical template]{.mark}** to be applied
uncritically]{.underline}. Similarly, [it [helps to **frame thematic**
and **empirical**]{.mark} **cases** in the classroom]{.underline} so
that course material is not merely a reflection the professor's
unexamined preference. In the classroom, it is up to the professor to
articulate. Beyond the classroom in administrative meetings, academic
conferences, and in print, it is up to the field to debate.

The next question asks what is the proper scope of IR teaching? This
question has also been asked before of the field but not directly about
the IR classroom (Albert and Buzan 2017, 898). The answer to this
question connects different themes of this article: intellectual
rejuvenation and disciplinary renewal, diversity, and the future of
international relations as an intellectual project. In substance and in
design, [the scope of IR teaching should [**embrace pluralism** in
paradigm, empirical remit]{.mark}, and criticism]{.underline}. A great
deal has been made of pluralism in international relations (Levine and
McCourt 2018; Eun 2016), but pluralism in the taught discipline is far
different from pluralism in the published discipline, where differences
accrue over the merits of accumulation and diversity. Here, [the scope
of possibility in the classroom is **far more intellectually
permissive**. Teaching international relations can be **theoretically**
and **empirically promiscuous**]{.underline}. It can respect the canon,
its inner logic, and its external life, as well as contemporary
alternatives (Ferguson 2015). [This]{.underline} is an "integrative
pluralism" (Dunne, Hansen, and Wight 2013, 416) that [embraces diversity
as a means of "providing **more comprehensive** and **multidimensional
accounts** of complex phenomena" and a pedagogical engagement with the
world that includes, but **hardly limited** to the Euro-Atlantic
theater, that has dominated]{.underline} generations of [IR
thinking]{.underline} (Dunne, Hansen, and Wight 2013, 416).

Pedagogical pluralism in international relations flows from intuitions
about balancing theory and empirics, the canon and its alternatives,
being current while eschewing presentism, being "useful" without being
instrumentalist, and drawing on instructor expertise without being
constrained by the hyperspecialized knowledge attendant to the published
discipline. Of course, this is easy to say. But operationalizing these
intuitions into a pluralistic teaching program is much more difficult.
Complicating the matter is the relative absence of explicit theoretical
guidance for making IR pluralism work in the classroom. The insights of
proponents of a "Global IR" can help, including some critiqued above for
their neglect of the classroom. In particular, Acharya and Buzan's
(2019, 300--308) program for developing a Global IR provides concrete
steps toward curriculum design as much as is does for research.

Regarding the IR theoretical parts of their program, Acharya and Buzan
(2019, 301) say that Global IR respects existing theories while "giving
due recognition to the places, roles, and contributions of non-Western
peoples and societies," which entails "pluralization within theories,
rather than just between them." There are issues here. First,
[[pluralization between theories requires **expanding the remit** of IR
theory beyond]{.mark} the grand [IR paradigms to include **non-Western
contributions**]{.mark}]{.underline} to international thought (Acharya
and Buzan 2010; Acharya 2011). [But this is not easy]{.underline}.
Tickner and Wæver (2009) make it clear that [Anglo-American IR looms
impossibly large around the world. Without jettisoning this intellectual
inheritance]{.underline}, Thinking International Relations Differently
(Tickner and Blaney 2012) provides a route to [pluralism]{.underline}.
That volume [**interrogates alternative meanings** to some of
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elation[s']{.underline}
[central concepts]{.underline}---security, state, sovereignty and
authority, globalization, secularism, religion, and the international. A
professor committed to [this kind of [pluralism]{.mark} can
**[expand]{.mark} the conceptual [vocabulary]{.mark}** of international
relations in a way that **encourages**]{.underline} undergraduate
[**conversancy** in multiple IR vernaculars **within** and **beyond**
the Anglo-American core]{.underline}.

[There is also the matter of what do with the **existing**,
**Western-centric canon**]{.underline}. Acharya and Buzan (2019, 301)
also say that [a global international relations would **subsume** rather
than **supplant** existing IR theories and methods. The purpose here is
**not to displace** Western-dominated IR knowledge but to **situate** it
within the global context]{.underline}. This is an entirely attainable
objective for an IR theory instructor. IR teachers should have full
command of some IR theories while being conversant in nearly all anyway.
[Integrating a fuller slate of intellectual content into teaching IR
theory permits]{.underline} a **[cognitive pluralism]{.underline}** that
is rarely available in the published discipline. The point here is that
teaching narrowly and to the expertise of professors may suit their
interests, but it puts blinders on the students. Upper-year and graduate
studies can explore specific pathways, but only after international
relations' map has been presented. This likely means instructors must
venture out of their preferred intellectual comfort zones and teach to
their weaknesses as well as their strengths. Doing so, however, requires
breaking through disciplinary walls and should not be underestimated. It
requires breadth of knowledge, disciplinary literacy beyond the
scholar's training, and language skills (usually beyond English) that
can take many years to develop, while the imperatives of the published
discipline stress specialization.

Regarding the empirical subject matter, a pluralistic IR agenda would
ground its empirics in world history rather than just Western history
(Acharya and Buzan 2019, 301) This is demanding on an instructor whose
subject-matter expertise will be narrow (by dint of academic training)
and whose time will be short given other professional and personal
commitments. Without considerable effort, this is more of an ideal than
a reality. But a good start would be to follow Acharya and Buzan's
(2019, 303) admonition to integrate the study of regions, regionalism,
and area studies into the curriculum. In particular, this means offering
case studies, examples, and illustrations drawn from parts of the world
outside the Euro-Atlantic zone. To this we can add Buzan and Lawson's
(2015) case for expanding the temporal remit of international relations
to the nineteenth century. This would break free of the apocryphal
founding myths (Carvalho, Leira, and Hobson 2011) and temporal myopia of
the orthodox discipline (Buzan and Lawson 2014) in order to draw upon a
richer and more global context for the emergence of the modern world. A
worldly curriculum will likely begin rather thin, but over time become
much deeper and more inclusive. Perhaps [more attainable in the
short-term is a [pluralistic pedagogy that recognizes **multiple forms
of agency**]{.mark} beyond the state and material power.
Such]{.underline} an approach would entail [a pedagogy]{.underline}
addressing a diverse constellation of actors in world politics that
[offers a faithful representation of an overwhelmingly complex
environment **without reducing it** exclusively to a handful of Western
powers]{.underline}.

### IR Good\-\--Short

the taught discipline. This is a shame because the answers matter for
the nature of the design of individual courses and entire degree
programs.

Just like the published discipline, the taught discipline is radically
decentralized in universities around the world, subnational variations,
department-level programs, and individual scholar's preferences. Thus,
it is incumbent on individual professors to give an answer in their own
teaching programs. At the individual level, answering the question about
the purpose of teaching international relations should outfit students
with an answer to what they are about to encounter and why this topic,
course, or degree program is worth pursuing. Students, especially early
undergraduate students, need to know why they are about to be presented
with the complicated theory and obscure events that are core (or
peripheral) to [the IR discipline]{.underline}. Answers are generously
supplied in the introduction chapters to IR textbooks but the suite of
options betrays a lack of focus that is symptomatic of the wider field
(Albert 2010). However, [this permissive intellectual environment is
beneficial for **wide-ranging intellectual pursuits**, **teaching
styles**, and **pedagogical agendas**]{.underline}. [It
**may**]{.underline}, though, [come at the cost]{.underline}. The
institutional underpinnings [of]{.underline} the discipline---faculty
administrators, editorial boards, funding agencies, hiring committees,
and so on--- may end up doing as much to shape the boundaries of the
discipline as the substantive output (Albert and Buzan 2017, 908). The
alternative, though, is subjecting intellectual and academic freedom to
[an **institutionalized orthodoxy**]{.underline}. In teaching,
decentralization may be intellectually permissive but may come at the
expense of disciplinary coherence.

[This concern]{.underline}, though, [may be **overstated**]{.underline}.
TRIP **[data]{.underline}** on curriculum design [gives an indication of
the **competing** and sometimes **overlapping pedagogical
priorities**]{.underline} among the IR professoriate. In a question on
introduction to IR classes, respondents were asked whether their
introductory courses are designed more to introduce IR scholarship
within the discipline or to prepare students to be informed about
foreign policy and international issues. The result favors a mix of both
with 80.83 percent incorporating scholarship and issues in some balance.
The remaining 19.17 percent come down in favor of one to the exclusion
of the other. At the master's level, the ratio is a bit narrower (73 to
27 percent) but still overwhelmingly embraces a mixture of academic
scholarship and international issues (Maliniak et al. 2014). Respondents
are a bit more divided on what undergraduate courses should be mandatory
in an IR program. They overwhelmingly agree (73.25 percent) that IR
theory should be a required subject. However, they differ on other
options. The next most popular candidates for a required course are
international/global political economy (45.37 percent), international
security (38.87 percent), and research methods (35.22 percent), followed
by international organizations (27.59 percent), comparative foreign
policy (22.86 percent), home country foreign policy (19.95 percent),
international law (19.85 percent), diplomatic history (19.11 percent),
and international economics (15.17 percent) (Maliniak et al. 2014). The
point is that [resolving what IR teaching is supposed to accomplish is
**hardly settled**]{.underline}, but there is some convergence on
certain issues.

So, [what]{.underline} then, [is the purpose of teaching
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations? Ultimately, it is up
to the individual instructor to answer and to enact a program
accordingly. But [it is up to the community of scholars to
**debate**]{.underline}. It may well be that the enormous variation in
the purpose of teaching international relations and the radical
decentralization is an inescapable feature of the taught discipline.
[Though IR teaching may be **wildly divergent**]{.underline} around the
world, [there is **always some purpose** to it, and]{.underline},
however defined, [this is an **intrinsic feature** of an
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations
[education]{.underline}. Here, Cox's (1981, 128) famous admonition that
"[theory is **always for someone** and **for some
purpose**]{.underline}" serves as the anchor concept for
[such]{.underline} pedagogical [framing]{.underline}. It [frames IR
theories as **political things** and **not just abstractions** to be
memorized or an **analytical template** to be applied
uncritically]{.underline}. Similarly, [it helps to **frame thematic**
and **empirical cases** in the classroom]{.underline} so that course
material is not merely a reflection the professor's unexamined
preference. In the classroom, it is up to the professor to articulate.
Beyond the classroom in administrative meetings, academic conferences,
and in print, it is up to the field to debate.

The next question asks what is the proper scope of IR teaching? This
question has also been asked before of the field but not directly about
the IR classroom (Albert and Buzan 2017, 898). The answer to this
question connects different themes of this article: intellectual
rejuvenation and disciplinary renewal, diversity, and the future of
international relations as an intellectual project. In substance and in
design, [the scope of IR teaching should **embrace pluralism** in
paradigm, empirical remit, and criticism]{.underline}. A great deal has
been made of pluralism in international relations (Levine and McCourt
2018; Eun 2016), but pluralism in the taught discipline is far different
from pluralism in the published discipline, where differences accrue
over the merits of accumulation and diversity. Here, [the scope of
possibility in the classroom is **far more intellectually permissive**.
Teaching international relations can be **theoretically** and
**empirically promiscuous**]{.underline}. It can respect the canon, its
inner logic, and its external life, as well as contemporary alternatives
(Ferguson 2015). [This]{.underline} is an "integrative pluralism"
(Dunne, Hansen, and Wight 2013, 416) that [embraces diversity as a means
of "providing **more comprehensive** and **multidimensional accounts**
of complex phenomena" and a pedagogical engagement with the world that
includes, but **hardly limited** to the Euro-Atlantic theater, that has
dominated]{.underline} generations of [IR thinking]{.underline} (Dunne,
Hansen, and Wight 2013, 416).

### Integrative Pluralism

#### Judge the debate through a lens of [integrative pluralism]{.underline}---putting theories into conversation through [evidence comparison]{.underline} and the [burden of rejoinder]{.underline} opens space for marginalized perspectives. Centering debate on the explanatory power of competing worldviews [reinforces academic exclusion]{.underline}.

**Wight, 19**---Professor and Chair of Government and International
Relations in the School of Social and Political Sciences at the
University of Sydney, Australia (Colin, "Bringing the outside in: The
limits of theoretical fragmentation and pluralism in IR theory,"
Politics, Vol 39, Issue 1, 2019, dml)

[Pluralism for the sake of pluralism seems]{.underline} to lead to an
incapacitating relativism, or what Yosef Lapid (2003) calls a
'**[flabby]{.underline}** pluralism'. A better term might be disengaged
pluralism. [[**No claim** or **viewpoint** would]{.mark} seem to [be
**invalid**, and theorists]{.mark} are free to [pursue their own agenda
with]{.mark} **little** or **[no contact]{.mark} with alternative
views**. This is [a **disengaged pluralism**]{.mark} because there is
**no attempt to specify the relationships between theories** or to
**examine one's own theoretical position** in the light of alternative
views. The absence of an agreed unity of method would also entail that
the **standards** by which the various theories are to be **judged**
[would be **internal**]{.mark} **to the theory**]{.underline} (Jackson,
2011; Smith, 2004). [This would be a disengaged form of pluralism with
each theoretical perspective [legitimating]{.mark} its claims **[solely
on its own terms]{.mark}** and with **little reason to engage in
conversations with alternative approaches**. It is the kind of pluralism
that finds its political expression in **apartheid**]{.underline}.
Despite the intense theoretical debate that followed the 'third debate'
(Waever's 'fourth'), IR now seems to have settled into an uneasy truce
based on theoretical pluralism/fragmentation. Indeed, in some respects,
the validity of the 'ism's' themselves have been called into question
(Lake, 2013). **[Analytical eclecticism]{.underline}** (Sil and
Katzenstein, 2010) [now seems to be the **mantra of the day**. The
[question]{.mark} remains as to [whether we]{.mark} **simply [embrace
this fragmentation]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} attempt to [work towards
a]{.mark} **more [coherent view]{.mark}** [of global
processes]{.mark}]{.underline}. My own view is that [we
should]{.underline} attempt to [move towards]{.underline} a position
that I will term '[**[integrative pluralism]{.underline}**']{.mark}
(Mitchell, 2003). [Integrative pluralism [is **not**]{.mark} an attempt
[to **forge competing**]{.mark} **knowledge [claims into one]{.mark}
overarching [position]{.mark}** that subsumes them all. It is
**not**]{.underline} a form of **[theoretical synthesis]{.underline}**
(Kratochwil, 2003), **[[nor]{.underline}]{.mark}** is it [a **[middle
ground]{.mark}** that eclectically claims to **take the best of various
theories** [to]{.mark} forge them into a '**grand [theory of
everything]{.mark}**']{.underline} (Wendt, 1999). [Integrative
[pluralism]{.mark} **accepts** and **[preserves]{.mark} the
[validity]{.mark}** [of a]{.mark} **wide [range]{.mark} of theoretical
perspectives** [and **embraces**]{.mark} **theoretical
[diversity]{.mark}** as a means of [providing]{.mark} **more
[comprehensive]{.mark}** and **[multi-dimensional accounts]{.mark} of
complex phenomena**. This is **not** a suggestion that a summation of
the various theoretical claims will **produce a complete account**; we
**could not know** when any account was complete]{.underline}. Moreover,
[engaging in integrative pluralism carries **risks**, and [some
theories]{.mark} **may not survive**]{.underline}. In the course
engagement, [some theories **[may]{.mark} ultimately [be
rejected]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} others may [undergo]{.mark}
**substantial change** and **[modification]{.mark}**]{.underline};
hence, it is not a form of relativism. [[Which]{.mark} theories
**[contribute]{.mark} to our overall stock of knowledge** [and which
**fall**]{.mark} **by the wayside**]{.underline}, however, [[is **not an
issue that can be resolved solely in**]{.mark} **the heat of
[metatheoretical debate]{.mark}**. The **ultimate [test]{.mark}** of
integrative pluralism [will be **practice**]{.mark}, but this is a
practice [that **cannot**]{.mark} **even [begin]{.mark}** [unless we
have]{.mark} some sense of its **problems**, **possibilities** and
**[practicality]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Current **[theoretical
debate]{.underline}** in the discipline [**does not seem conducive to
this discussion** and theories seem to function as **identity markers**
within a social system **suffused by battles over resources** and
**power**. Understanding the different forms of pluralism is
[**essential** in]{.mark} terms of **[opening up space for global voices
to enter]{.mark} the IR conversation**. If mainstream, mainly Western,
dominated IR theory **struggles to listen to alternative
voices**]{.underline} from within its own limited inter-paradigmatic
frameworks, [then there is **little chance** that it will be **open to
non-western voices**]{.underline}. In addition, [if non-western global
voices enter the terrain on the **terms already set** by the
fragmentation of the 'isms' then **opportunities for serious dialogue**
will be **limited**. [Given]{.mark} the [potential]{.mark} for
non-western voices [to **reconfigure IR**]{.mark} **theory along new**
and **interesting lines**, [it would be a **disaster** if]{.mark} those
voices **[adopted]{.mark} the [frameworks]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} have
**[stymied]{.mark} serious cross theoretical [debate]{.mark}** thus
far]{.underline}. Indeed, [the **current theoretical landscape** that
confronts new entrants to the discipline might be one factor that
**increases their exclusion**]{.underline}. Those global voices will
have a greater potential of not repeating the mistakes of the past if
they have a sophisticated understanding of the structural configuration
that has produced 'isms inertia'. Getting around the current theoretical
impasse will require an explanation of how it arises and an account of
the limits, problems and potentials of theorising in IR. I suggest four
main factors help explain theoretical fragmentation in the discipline.
First is ontology. [The contemporary international political system
is]{.underline} best understood as [a **complex open system**, which
displays '**emergent properties**' and degrees of '**organised
complexity**']{.underline}. Because **[[all]{.mark} human
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline}** have this form, they [[require a
**plurality of explanations**]{.mark} to deal with phenomena at
**differing levels**, [and]{.mark} the **[complex]{.mark}
differentiation of [causal mechanisms]{.mark}** within levels. Since
theory is a **process of abstraction**, and since we **cannot isolate
particular mechanism** in the manner of]{.underline} some of [the
natural sciences, then some form of theoretical pluralism is
**necessary**]{.underline} and to be expected. Yet some of the natural
sciences face a similar situation and have not regressed into a state of
rampant theoretical fragmentation. So, complexity is not a sufficient
explanation. Second, is [the academic division of labour]{.underline},
which [**compartmentalises knowledge into zones of expertise**,
which]{.underline} in turn, [**structurally impedes** the development of
interdisciplinary research needed to explain complex
systems]{.underline}. Third, is the structure of IR as an academic
discipline, which using a framework developed by Richard Whitley (1984),
I characterise as a 'fragmented adhocracy'. Whitley views reputation as
the currency of an academic discipline. A fragmented adhocracy is marked
by a low degree of reputational interdependency between competing
research groups, with few organisational impediments regarding the
choice of theoretical framework, research methodology or even core
problematic. As a consequence, the [[research]{.mark}
activity]{.underline} within the field [[proceeds]{.mark} in an
[**arbitrary**, **incoherent**]{.mark} and at times **[ad hoc]{.mark}
manner**, [with **few**]{.mark} **sustained [attempts to
integrate]{.mark} new research** with the **existing configuration of
knowledge**]{.underline}. In such an intellectual structure, the
potential for integrative pluralism is low. The fourth reason, however,
is the most important, the most problematic, and I suspect the most
difficult to change. This is the issue of epistemology, and in
particular disciplinary accounts of its place in the practice of
science. My argument here is simple: [The way IR currently
understands]{.underline} the issue of [epistemology, is **confused**,
**incorrect** and [a **severe barrier to serious debate across**]{.mark}
**differing theoretical [perspectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I refer
here to [the [**widespread view** that]{.mark}]{.underline} positivism,
postpositivism, rationalism, constructivism, feminism and postmodernism,
for example, are epistemological positions. For instance, according to
Markus Kornprobst: [The **deepest** and **most consequential
disagreements**]{.underline} in the field [are
**epistemological**]{.underline}. Both the so-called 'third debate'
(Lapid, 1989) between positivists and postpositivists and the
'communicative stasis' (Lapid, 2003: 130) that has succeeded it, speak
volumes about the divisiveness of assumptions on how to produce
knowledge. (Kornprobst, 2009: 87) And for Steve Smith: the key
difference between rationalist and reflectivist approaches is that,
broadly speaking, rationalist accounts are positivist, whereas
reflectivist approaches oppose positivism ... for now it is enough to
note that the central differences between rationalist and reflectivist
accounts are epistemological and methodological, and only secondarily
about what the world is like (ontology). (Smith, 2010: 5) This account
[[treats]{.mark} the [debate]{.mark}]{.underline} between positivists
and postpositivists [[as]{.mark} a **debate [between competing
epistemologies]{.mark}**. This [is an **error**]{.mark}; positivism is
**not an epistemology** but a **philosophy of science**]{.underline}.
Moreover, [the idea of a 'feminist']{.underline} epistemology
[or]{.underline} a [postmodern epistemology **makes no sense**. At best
we might talk about]{.underline} feminist methods or postmodern
**[methods]{.underline}**. However, [to ask]{.underline} of a positivist
for example, ['**how do you know X**']{.underline}, and to receive the
reply 'because of positivism' [is **not an epistemological position** it
is a **statement of identity**]{.underline}. As John Gunnell (1998: 7),
argues '[[epistemology]{.mark}, properly construed,
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} I will maintain a post-hot enterprise
**[[contingent on]{.underline}]{.mark}** substantive theory and
scientific [**[practice]{.underline}**']{.mark}. Yet rarely, if ever,
are we told why the differences between positivism and postpositivism
are legitimately treated in epistemological terms? [**[Never]{.mark} is
it [explained]{.mark}** [why epistemologies **cannot be**]{.mark}
**integrated** and/or [**combined**; apart]{.mark}]{.underline} that is,
[[from **vague allusions**]{.mark} **to
incommensurability**]{.underline} (Wight, 1996). [This is to **misuse**
and **abuse** the term epistemology]{.underline}. It is a misuse and
abuse of the term because [epistemological [positions]{.mark} **do not
operate as**]{.underline} the [**a priori discontinuous** and **discrete
entities**]{.underline} this view suggests. I take it as given that the
argument about complexity is a given. Likewise, the adverse effects of
the academic division of labour in terms of impeding interdisciplinary
work are not in doubt. Hence, the article will concentrate on the
relationship between current understandings of epistemology and the
structure of IR as an academic discipline. [These]{.underline} two
[aspects are **mutually reinforcing**. Current understandings of
epistemology in IR **reproduce the disciplinary social structure**, and
the disciplinary structure **reproduces the current understanding of
epistemology**]{.underline}. Before proceeding, however, a clarification
on the issue of science. My position is based on what is known as
scientific realism (Psillos, 1999). According to scientific realism,
[there is **[no]{.mark}**]{.underline} such thing as the scientific
[**[method]{.mark}** that [can be **applied in all domains**]{.mark} and
**[across all]{.mark} subject [matters]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Science
is not one thing it is many. There is no one scientific method, and
[[each]{.mark} science [needs to **orientate**]{.mark} **its methods**
[according to the **specifics**]{.mark} **of its object domain**. How we
study sub-atomic particles will **require different methods** to how we
study human societies]{.underline}. For the sake of expediency,
[I]{.underline} will [merely define science as the attempt to come to
understand and/or explain the chosen object domain through
**systematic** and **critical inquiry**]{.underline}.

### No Prior Questions/Root Cause

#### Sweeping theories can't explain policy decisions---if they can, then our framework [link turns]{.underline} their offense.

**Rose, 21**---editor of Foreign Affairs (Gideon, "Foreign Policy for
Pragmatists," Foreign Affairs, March/April 2021, dml)

[[Theories]{.mark} of]{.underline} history, fundamental beliefs about
**[how the world works]{.underline}**, [[are]{.mark} usually
[**assumed** rather than **argued**]{.mark} and **[rarely]{.mark}** get
[subjected to]{.mark} **serious [scrutiny]{.mark}**. Yet these general
ideas **set the parameters** for]{.underline} all the **[specific policy
choices]{.underline}** an administration makes. Know an administration's
theory of history, and much of the rest is easy to fill in.

There are a lot of possible [theories]{.underline} of history, but they
[tend to fall]{.underline}, like Bush's and Trump's, [into two main
camps: **optimistic** and **pessimistic**]{.underline}. Thus, the
Clinton administration followed its own version of happy
directionality---think of it as Bush with less muscular Christianity.
And there have been earlier believers in Trump's dark and stormy night,
as well.

Unfortunately, [given the stakes of the question, **[no one]{.mark}
really [knows]{.mark}** [whether]{.mark} the [optimists or]{.mark} the
[pessimists have the better case]{.mark}]{.underline}. Political
[theorists have fought about that for **centuries**]{.underline}, with
neither side winning. A few generations ago, modern social scientists
joined in, [**generating** and **testing** lots of theories in lots of
ways, but still, **neither** camp bested the other]{.underline}. And
then, in the last few years, history got interesting again and erased
some of the few things the scholars thought they had learned.

As individuals, presidents have had strong views on these matters. As a
group, they have not. [[American]{.underline}]{.mark} foreign
[[policy]{.mark} is **notorious** for its **[internal
tensions]{.mark}**. Its fits and starts and reversals [**do not fit
easily** into any single theoretical framework]{.mark}. Yet this
pluralism has proved to be a **feature**, not a **bug**. Precisely
because [it **has not embraced any one approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}
to foreign policy [**[consistently]{.mark}**, Washington has managed to
**avoid the worst aspects** of all]{.underline}. Blessed with
geopolitical privilege, it has slowly stumbled forward, moving over the
centuries from peripheral obscurity to global hegemony. [Its genius has
been less **strategic insight** than an ability to **cut
losses**]{.underline}.

By now, [it seems fair to say that [the debate]{.mark} between the
optimists and the pessimists **[will never be settled]{.mark}
conclusively**, since each perspective knows something big]{.underline}
about international politics. [[Instead of **choosing**]{.mark} between
them]{.underline}, the new administration should [[keep **both**]{.mark}
truths in its pocket, [taking **each** out as
appropriate]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Learning in U.S. foreign policy has come largely across administrations.
President Joe Biden's goal should be to speed up the process, allowing
it to happen within an administration. Call it the Bayesian Doctrine:
rather than being wedded to its priors, the administration should
constantly update them.

[The way to do so is to [make theorists]{.mark}]{.underline}, not
principals, the administration's true team of rivals, forcing them to
[[make **real-world predictions**, and]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[offer
**testable practical advice**]{.mark}, and then [seeing whose **turn
out**]{.mark} **to be [better]{.mark}** in real time]{.underline}. In
this approach, searching [[**intellectual honesty** is more important
than **ideology**; what people think **matters less** than whether they
can **change their minds**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Constantly calculating
implied odds won't always win pots. But it will help the administration
fold bad hands early, increasing its winnings over time.

### Rejecting IR Fails

#### Rejecting IR scholarship as praxis creates [openings]{.underline} for [far-right cooption]{.underline}. There is [no single disciplinary impulse]{.underline} within IR.

**Michelsen, 21**---Department of War Studies, School of Security,
King's College London (Nicholas, "What is a minor international theory?
On the limits of 'Critical International Relations'," Journal of
International Political Theory, Vol 17, Issue 3, 2021, dml)

[The problem of synthesis stalks all self-defining Critical approaches
to IR. [Defining]{.mark} the **[terms of]{.mark}**]{.underline}
reference for [**intellectual [dissidence]{.mark}** [in relation to IR's
'disciplin]{.mark}ary crisis']{.underline}, as the poststructuralists
did in viewing critique as a function of disciplinary marginality,
[[created conditions **ripe** for viewing **any**]{.mark} **competitor
[theory]{.mark}** [as **problematic**]{.mark} to the degree that they
can be deemed **insufficiently minor**]{.underline} (Whitehall, 2016).
[The [idea]{.mark} that [critique necessitates moving '**beyond**
IR']{.mark}]{.underline} as an inherently majoritarian project [[has
become **a**]{.mark} **widely expressed [trope]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
The result is that Critical IR theorists now engage in increasingly
virulent disagreements over the political and ethical implications of
disciplinarity itself. In perpetual abeyance, [[claimants to Critical
IR]{.mark} [become **hostages** to]{.mark} **a continuous
[risk]{.mark}** [of being exposed as **insufficiently pure**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the ([[modernist, racist, colonial]{.mark},
patriarchal, heteronormative, positivist, capitalist]{.underline})
[[traces]{.underline}]{.mark} of 'the major literature/discipline'. At
the same time, Critical IR scholars who advocate for a disciplinary exit
in search of 'more Critical' inter-disciplines have found themselves
wrestling with the charge of pre-judgement: [Since they appear to know
what 'Being Critical' will look like]{.underline} after
de-disciplinarisation, [[critique takes]{.mark} the [form of **testing**
whether]{.mark} other [scholars meet]{.mark} these **[pre-given
criteria]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Holden, 2006; **[[Howell and
Richter-Montpetit]{.underline}]{.mark}**, 2020).

[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} stream in contemporary IR scholarship
[**[ignores]{.mark}** the [manners in which]{.mark}]{.underline} minor
[[theories, **far from tending to**]{.mark}**wards
[alliances]{.mark}**[, are]{.mark} often [set to
**contradictory**]{.mark} **political and ethical [purposes]{.mark}**.
And that **the [visions]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **[world]{.mark}
politics** created [by scholars **'moving beyond'**]{.mark}
**disciplinary [IR]{.mark}** [can be **just as problematic**]{.mark} as
visions already settled within the discipline. **[Contemporary]{.mark}
political and social [movements]{.mark}** [borrow]{.mark} **intellectual
[resources]{.mark}** from various]{.underline} (once or still) [minor
theoretical traditions in IR [to think against **a 'Globalist'**]{.mark}
**world [order]{.mark}**, [incorporating]{.mark}]{.underline} the
Gramscian position that 'politics is downstream from culture', [the
ideal of a **transgressive emancipatory identity**, and the **critique
of neo-colonialism**]{.underline} (Love, 2017; Nagle 2017). The
philosopher Alain De Benoist wrote his manifesto for the New Right in
the year 2000 with the aim of challenging the oppressive implications of
major international theories, especially Liberalism, borrowing widely
from resources of minor intellectual critique (de Benoist and
Champetier, 1999). [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} theory
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} marginal in disciplinary IR, but [[influential
amongst **populist politicians**]{.underline}]{.mark} like Putin, Trump,
Orban, Salvini and Le Pen, [as well as online communities of **[Race
Realists]{.mark}**, [**western chauvinists**, and **white**
]{.mark}**nationalists**. It proposes that Liberalism **destroys the
autonomy** of ethnicities and cultures, and that the history of the west
has been one of ongoing **cultural** as well as **political
colonialism**]{.underline}. De Benoist's argument is that the project of
decolonisation is incomplete, and continues through international aid
and UN-led Liberal paternalism.

[The answer proposed by the **New Right** is to restore a **truly
independent status** to diverse cultures and indigenous world-views in
International Relations, and suggest that people belonging to these
'birth-cultures' must actively work towards their **national** and
**cognitive emancipation** from all the baggage of Liberal
modernity]{.underline}, if necessary, [through **violently closing
borders**]{.underline}. The New Right claims its intellectual
marginality vis-à-vis Liberalism or Globalism (understood as the
ideological representative of modernism in international thought) is a
marker of its virtue. The New Right is not, however, widely viewed as a
'Critical ally' of Decolonial IR theory.

A claim to minor theoretical status is also visible amongst reactionary
theorists of gender, including online groups of men's rights activists,
western chauvinist militias like the Proud Boys, or traditionalist
'family values' movements (Nagle, 2017). These groups develop an
operative concept of the radical intellectual margins as central to
their understandings of critique, and of the emancipatory relationship
which their critique has to hegemonic theoretical frameworks that they
perceive as oppressing them: Liberalism or 'Cultural Marxism' (Nagle,
2017). These actors see their critiques of what they term 'gender
ideology' as part of a necessary escape from the straightjacket of
modernist categories, currently hegemonic in contemporary academia. In
other words, the belief that transgressive or marginal theory is
emancipatory has diverse advocates, whose antimodernism or
anti-hegemonism comes with divergent attitudes to gender, race, culture,
economics, social, political and international organisation.

The sociological implications of this point were anticipated, but not
fully developed, by Katz (1996: 488), who noted that:

['**[talk]{.mark} of exclusion** [can lead to]{.mark} an **unsavory
hierarchy of [marginalization]{.mark}** -- a kind of **[competitive
victimology]{.mark}** -- [and]{.mark} even to the cul-de-sac of an
**[essentialist identity politics]{.mark}**. Notions of [exclusion
are]{.mark}]{.underline} all about, one might even say
[**[tautologically]{.mark}** [about, position]{.mark}, and if we are not
careful [they]{.mark} can [lead to **relativist**]{.mark} [**accounts**
that offer **little**]{.mark} **of practical [value]{.mark}**. And they
can be **disingenuous** -- proclamations of exclusion by scholars who
are **quite included**]{.underline}'.

The historical moment facing critique calls us to recognise that minor
[[theories infer **no allied ethics**]{.mark} **or politics**. [There is
**no cohesive**]{.mark} **and abiding** [sovereign]{.mark} '**logic of
[modernity]{.mark}**' [that forms the **superstructure** of]{.mark}
**disciplinary [IR]{.mark}**, and gives **assurance** that the
postdisciplinary avant-guard will **share an understanding of
virtue**]{.underline}. The romanticism characteristic of self-describing
Critical intellectual cultures that arose in IR in the immediate
Post-Cold War context must now be reconsidered. [Many of **[the
same]{.mark} intellectual [tools]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} now being
**effectively [mobilised by]{.mark} reactionaries**, [**racists** and
**gender absolutists**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Contemporary
reactionaries]{.underline} have read their Deleuze, their Gramsci, their
Derrida and Foucault (see Land, 2012), and they [are **cognisant** of
the discursive logic and rhetorical power of]{.underline}, for example,
[concepts of **exclusion**, **identity**, **precarity**,
**marginality**, **hegemony**, the **avant-guard**, **victimhood** and
**indigeneity**]{.underline} (see Michelsen and De Orellana, 2019).

[The challenge facing scholars in IR who seek to write in the service of
vulnerable groups]{.underline}, like migrants lacking a safe home state,
those who do not fit with heteronormative gender roles, or the victims
of racism, [is that their reactionary theoretical interlocutors have
**recognised the power** in claiming to be uniquely reflexive critics,
**intellectually marginal** vis-à-vis dominant theoretical assumptions
about IR]{.underline}. The category [['Critical IR' provides]{.mark}
**[no tools]{.mark}** by which [to **counter**]{.mark} these
[relativistic arguments]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this context, [the
[belief]{.mark} that ['Being Critical' **requires**]{.mark}]{.underline}
a minoritarian [[**exit** from]{.mark} **disciplinary [IR]{.mark}**
[may]{.mark} be a **[distract]{.mark}ion** [from]{.mark} developing
**methodologically and epistemologically [rigorous critiques]{.mark}**,
that can be communicated as such. Faith in the emancipatory intellectual
margins brings]{.underline} to mind Latour's (2004: 225) [worry that
self-describing ['Critical' scholars]{.mark} today [are]{.mark} like
'**those [mechanical]{.mark} toys** that **endlessly [make the same
gesture]{.mark}** when everything else has changed around
them']{.underline}.
