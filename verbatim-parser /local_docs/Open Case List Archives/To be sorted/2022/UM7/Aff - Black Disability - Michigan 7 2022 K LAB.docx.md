### 1AC \-\-- Definitions 

####  Definition of mad blackness :: black madness

**Pickens 19** \[Therí Alyce Pickens, Professor of English, specializing
in African American, Arab America and disability literatures and
theories at Bates University, June 7, 2019 "Black Madness :: Mad
Blackness", Duke University Press, Durham and London, pgs. 4-5, JMH\]

Despite my academic and personal proclivity for politesse and rigorous
specificity, I choose to rest in the vagueness and insult mad brings.8 I
mobilize this word as part of my critical armature because this
discussion requires a direct engagement with slippery and insulting
language.9 Mad carries a lexical range that includes (in)sanity,
cognitive disability, anger, and, for anyone who remembers the slang of
the 1990s, excess (usually synonymous with too or really). In common
parlance, it is used pejoratively and remains rather vague. However,
[[mad studies takes up madness]{.mark} to "represent a critical
alternative to 'mental illness' or 'disorder' as a way of naming and
responding to emotional, spiritual, and neuro-diversity."10]{.underline}
[[Mad studies perspectives mobilize activist and scholastic
impulses]{.mark} in their refusal of the historical definitions of
madness as "irrationality, a condition involving decline or even
disappearance of the role of rational factor in the organization of
human conduct and experience" and the equation of madness with lack or
inability.11]{.underline} In this field, the biopsychiatric definitions
of madness that proceed from this historical definition---wedded to
inability and irrationality---no longer hold since they disenfranchise
the perspectives of those harmed by psy-disciplines. In this study[, [I
take seriously the critical impulses of mad studies: I keep a tension
between psychosocial definitions of madness]{.underline}]{.mark}
[(without attributing causality) and biomedical definitions (without
attributing authority), [while resisting an uncritical celebration of
madness as experience or as metaphor]{.mark}. Even though this project
focuses on those who would be labeled mad or embrace being mad, I also
do not veer too far away from the critical possibilities of madness as a
"slippery and unruly object."]{.underline}12 When **[[madness does not
solely refer to the experience of a mad person but rather pans outward
as a larger discourse, it challenges how "the psychic, cognitive, and
affective dimensions of experience are parceled out into categories . .
. all under the supposedly 'empirical' authority of medical science and
psychiatric expertise as much as through the exercise of legal and
juridical power."]{.underline}]{.mark}**13 In other words, **[[it is
everywhere and affects everything. Maddeningly
so.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In Black Madness :: Mad Blackness, **[[Black
functions as a racial category, cultural affiliation, and social
position. I use Black for its lexical and sociocultural range. It
includes a wide variety of people and experiences within the diaspora
and does not limit the discussion to a specific geopolitical imaginative
space]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Unfortunately, my discussion is limited in
scope to the parts of the diaspora that share an intellectual
inheritance with North America and Europe. As Julie Livingston's
Debility and the Moral Imagination in Botswana (2005) and Nirmala
Erevelles's Disability and Difference in Global Contexts (2011) make
clear, definitions of Blackness and disability cannot and should not be
moved carelessly across transnational borders.14 Yet, given the vastness
of colonial and imperial projects where race determines life and death,
**[[the study of Blackness emerges as a fecund space to think through
how material consequences manifest]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [As I have
claimed elsewhere, a turn to Blackness "authorizes a reconceptualization
of history, culture, and politics" if the field is understood as "a set
of traditions, reading practices, and valuation systems operating
alongside, intertwined with, but also independent from those of
whiteness."]{.underline}15 Like madness, Blackness is also everywhere
and affects everything. It is my hope that despite the necessary
geopolitical limitations of my project, it later proves useful for those
studying other Blacknesses. [I choose to nominalize Black and mad by
adding the suffix "ness" to attend to the two words as both description
and category.]{.underline} I bring them together grammatically to
theorize about the constellation of relationships that comprise the two.
Nirmala Erevelles, in writing about the Middle Passage, rereads Hortense
Spillers's work to point out that the simplified causal
relationship---slavery produces disability---does not fully encompass
the way disability and Blackness function. Rather,
["disability/impairment and race are neither merely biological nor
wholly discursive, but rather are historical material constructs
imbricated within the exploitative conditions of transnational
capitalism."]{.underline}16 My staged grammatical intervention in the
title calls attention to how a revision of this sort works**[. [It is at
once a ref erence to the material conditions and consequences as well as
a discursive attending to the categories' imbrication.]{.mark}
Nominalizing the two also staves off what Rachel Gorman argues is "[the
mad subject . . . constituted as the white subject at the horizon of
whiteness"17: that is, the mad white subject who can be embraced by
whiteness through a discourse of universality]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In
this formulation, [Blackness modifies (and I use the grammatical term
deliberately) who and what is mad. Madness as noun calls attention to
what Sami Schalk insists is a useful slippage between materiality and
metaphor in Black studies.]{.underline} She argues that within Black
literature, disability takes on "concrete and metaphorical meanings"
such that disability can "symbolize something other than disability
while still being about disability[." In so doing, "disability metaphors
therefore allow us to explore the historical and material connections
between disability and other social systems of privilege and
oppression."18]{.underline} As with Erevelles's formulation, [the two
categories do not exist in a simple causal or analogic relationship;
they inform each other such that madness modifies how we understand
Blackness.19]{.underline}

The term ["vitality politics"]{.underline} in the chapters to follow,
thus, [identifies a post-Reconstruction]{.underline} [politicization of
biological health as an instrument for insisting on a racial state of
exception in which African Americans' own unhealthy habits and disease
susceptibility justified their legitimate suspension from full rights to
social justice, economic opportunity, political equality, and
freedom]{.underline}. I use the term "vitality" deliberately because of
its layered meanings: first to invoke the language widely cited in early
twentieth-century discussions about racial destiny that debated the
private bodily practices and life processes of African Americans to
determine (allegedly on an objective scientific basis) the developmental
tendencies of freedmen and women and to medicalize economic, social, and
political discriminations (see chapter 1). But, second, [vitality
politics also registers the focus of African American reformers on
hygienic behaviors and environments to rehabilitate African Americans
into "vital" citizens practicing self-care and private risk management
promoted within modern liberal (and now neoliberal) multicultural racial
capitalism.1]{.underline}4 [Vitality Politics synthesizes multiple
strands within the broad field of what is collectively identified as
biopolitics, including theories of vulnerability, medicalization,
disability studies, slow death, necropolitics, mad studies, and vital
materialism to get at the complicated, and not always consistent, ways
that both the literal physical and mental health---the matter of Black
lives--- and the semiotic meanings and larger discursive narratives
attached to them functioned as key tactics shaping and controlling
African Americans' place as part of the shift toward modern liberal
governmentality]{.underline}. These practices of vitality politics, as a
consequence, require an attention to a complex notion of Black
personhood, one which necessitates us as literary and cultural critics
to avoid privileging representations over physicality or culture over
biology, and to acknowledge how post-Reconstruction material Black
personhood and its representation were being mutually transformed.15

#### Emerging technologies create [disinformation]{.underline} campaigns, expanding state influence to justify its [mistreatment]{.underline} of racialized and disabled subjects through the weaponization of cognitive dissonance in [algorithmic fashion]{.underline}

Zach **Naqvi 21** \[Department of Political Science, University of
Alberta, Madness, Migration and Media in the Modern Digital Age, April
14^th^ 2021, pg.2-7, -ekh-\]

Citizenship, migration and international relations informing how we
conceptualize policy get inextricably tied to sovereign states that
determine the fate of refugees. The framework that facilitates this
process has followed a chaotic trajectory in recent years. Understanding
the rise of populist rhetoric emerging in North America and Europe,
among others, points to recent developments in international relations
requiring greater scrutiny, with specific practices necessitating a
closer look by communities at home and abroad. I argue that [**we have
fallen short of our collective humanitarian promise** of dignity and
fundamental human rights for everyone, regardless of race, gender,
religion, class, or country of origin]{.underline}. Unsurprisingly, the
sovereignty of the state and a universal humanitarian aim have had
difficulties getting reconciled. In theory and practice, pragmatism and
utopia and things related to realist necessity versus a more utopian
idealism -- international relations are plagued with a disconnect
between what ought to be and what is. The reason is that
[**[states]{.mark}**, unlike individuals, families and communities **are
not concerned** primarily **with** such lofty ideals as **human
dignity**, fraternity, **equality**, and the like. Instead, **they
[get]{.mark}** inseparably **[linked with the]{.mark}** fundamental
**[objective of consolidating, maintaining, and executing
powers]{.mark}** that **[we]{.mark}**]{.underline} as individuals [upon
the grounds of elections, citizenship and birth or connection have
**[authorized the state to have]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Furthermore,
many view frameworks of citizenship and migration from a privileged
standpoint, concerned with realist undertones of security, sovereignty,
and the success of their state above all else. The dire question here is
whether those immigrating, seeking asylum or even completely stateless
can reasonably expect to be accommodated by sovereign states.

First, [alternative facts or the designation by some that we are
entering a post-truth world, amplified by improvements in technology
moving us collectively towards increasingly interconnected
existence]{.underline}, lay bare for all to see a new power dynamic
playing out over the past decade. [The aim of alternative facts is "to
establish power: **[they are lying to flaunt
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They are saying to us: 'we know that you
know that this is a lie, and we don't care, because there is absolutely
nothing you can do about it' ... over years, [**[ceaseless propaganda
and spectacle]{.mark}**, exacerbated by **corrections and retractions,
[can destroy your sense of reality]{.mark}.** Time spirals forward and
lurches backwards]{.underline}." (Kendzior, 2020, p.18) Take Franz
Fanon, for example. Despite his death decades ago, his lived experience
then provides critical insight now. [Fanon was a doctor]{.underline} and
the acclaimed author of Black Skin, White Masks. [Despite his subjective
personhood being complex and multifaceted, not constrained simply to
role or race, when practicing medicine, it is a mistake made as a black
doctor if he made a mistake.]{.underline} Similarly, [[**refugees,
migrants, and asylum seekers** are]{.underline}]{.mark} broadly
[**[categorized as if the totality of their being constitutes
race]{.mark}** -- and nothing more.]{.underline} Other times, we simply
view things based on monetary or pragmatic conditionality. As Fanon
notes, it is society, unlike biochemical processes, that do not escape
human influence. Yet[, **it is us that brings society into
being**]{.underline}. (Fanon, 2008, p. XV) We saw this media makeover
take place in society with the portrayal of Muslims, migrants and more
recently with the Chinese during COVID-19, among a myriad of other
examples through the ages. Kendzior notes how, "a media makeover is a
peculiar wound. It is a terrible feeling to be in pain and ignored -- as
a place, as a person. It is worse to be given a mask and told it's your
face." (Kendzior, 2020, p. 22) In other words, alongside ordinary people
behaving rationally according to human psychology, some behave
pathologically according to inhuman psychology. (Fanon, 2008, p. 15) [We
have forgotten sense from nonsense and implemented it ubiquitously as if
it held any semblance of truth]{.underline}.

Take Wiener's (1960) [**[framing]{.mark}** of the coming difficulties of
**[technological advancement]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It]{.underline}
still proves influential because he
**[[generalized]{.underline}]{.mark}** it **[beyond [literal
human--machine cooperation to any]{.mark} [situation in which two
systems work together]{.mark} at different temporal and perceptual
scales]{.underline}**. Because [choices]{.underline} [made]{.underline}
today [with limited information can have terrible long-term
consequences]{.underline} that we cannot foresee, Wiener warns that
"[the purpose put into the machine]{.underline} --- [be it a literal
machine]{.underline} like a Twitter algorithm, [or a metaphorical one
like the corporation that runs it]{.underline} --- [should be the
purpose that we 'really desire' and not a colourful
imitation."]{.underline} (Wiener, 1960; Prier, 2017) That colourful
imitation has become the norm with associations of refugees, migrants
and asylum seekers based not on dignity but premised on race and
identity politics masquerading as genuine discourse. In terms of how to
meaningfully address this inversion, I believe it necessary to borrow
from the very tactics we aim to illuminate. In a manner reminiscent of
Darko Maver, where "**[[the borders between reality and false]{.mark},
if they exist at all, [are so thin that often the roles exchange and
reality copies imitation,"]{.mark}]{.underline}** Deseriis (2010)
theorizes their method as a form of 'media homeopathy.' Where "the idea
was to inject into the media bloodstream stories whose patent falsity
would eventually induce the media immune system into a reaction of its
own." This example brings us to the most suggestive connection to the
present. The QAnon conspiracy, from the beginning, fixated on the lurid
idea of hidden child molestation rings. However, historically this is
nothing new. The middle ages were plagued with conspiracies concerning
Jewish cabals and children. (Spence, 2019) Recently, Swami (2012) noted
a positive relationship between right wing authoritarianism and beliefs
in anti-Jewish conspiracy theories, but a negative relationship with
general beliefs in conspiracy theories. It points to how individuals may
well pick and choose theories that fit with a particular political view
or belief system. Moreover, the 90s saw Italy face its version of
"Satanic Panic" around child sex abuse. Feeling that people were
baselessly targeted, Luther Blissett activists responded in an
unconventional way --- with a multiyear campaign of interconnected,
multi-city media pranks." (Davis, 2018) As Q-Anon has gotten 'unmasked'
recently in the HBO (2021) documentary Q, Into the Storm, and used to
get hosted on a site whose slogan is 'embrace infamy', it would appear
history has repeated itself through the injection of blatantly false
narratives, except this time -- it led to a clear and definitive mass
mobilization. Furthermore, states profoundly benefit from this
obfuscation, and I believe, as was the case with Trump in 2016, can have
real success from dividing people into distinct categories and
subsequently pitting these separate groups against each other. Rhetoric
based on this divisive and obfuscated nature is the link I explore that
differentiates arguments about justice, human rights, and dignity on the
one hand and the actual telos of institutions on the other. Migration,
immigration, and asylum frameworks have particularly gotten affected by
this developing phenomenon detaching its purpose from actions. What I
mean is instead of being concerned with the framework on which migration
gets premised, we have forgotten that the framework's telos or point in
favour of the outcomes that result from it. As a means to an end, the
frameworks are politicized in a Machiavellian manner, not ends in
themselves. Likewise, social media is not free as one would like to
believe. It follows a similar path as it is us who are the product,
which is done by commodifying our data. Additionally, migratory
narratives are often not concerned with promoting virtue but instead are
concerned with outcomes. Kantian autonomy and human dignity help one to
discern how this plays out; as is the case with varied frameworks, we
treat people as a means to an end and not an end in themselves. The
result: utilization of polarization for populist ends that often
scapegoat's foreigners, migrants, and refugees -- among other
fashionable outgroups, dependent on time, place, and circumstance.
(Muslims after 9/11, Turkish with BREXIT, Chinese during COVID,)

Unfortunately, as much as we have never been more connected, we are also
divided and polarized by the very tools that promote this connectivity.
Similarly, the problem with Trump's rhetoric, as with big tech, is that
the purpose or telos gets obfuscated, and as a result, many lack the
ability or context necessary to discern fundamental conceptions such as
the difference between a migrant, internally displaced person, and
refugee from broader conversations on what migratory regimes ought to
look like. A clear example of this was illustrated during Hurricane
Katrina, where many government representatives mistakenly referred to
the displaced persons as refugees. Additionally, ["**[the]{.mark}** U.S.
**[government did not]{.mark}** adequately **[protect the rights
of]{.mark}** Gulf Coast residents during displacement, failing in many
cases to prevent discrimination against **[the poor, immigrants, and
people of colour]{.mark},** and [**allowing** **children**]{.mark}, the
**[elderly, disabled persons]{.mark}** and other vulnerable populations
**[to be put in life-threatening situations]{.mark}**."]{.underline}
(Brookings, 2008, p. 5) If this occurred to those already in the US, it
is unsurprising to see this outcome on a more pervasive scale for those
with no citizenship or legal standing. On a more positive note, [despite
state powers, we also have the power to articulate concerns and voice
expectations -- albeit without a monopoly on violence like the
state]{.underline}. (Weber, 1965) As Kendzior points out, "[**[There is
a difference between expecting autocracy and accepting
autocracy]{.mark}**. It is necessary to **[expect it so that you
can]{.mark}** plan how you will **[fight]{.mark}**. But the **[battle
lines change]{.mark}**, and **[you]{.mark}** often **[end up changing
with them]{.mark}**]{.underline}." (Kendzior, 2020, p. 15) The sentiment
as mentioned above is echoed in Nietzche's quip how "he who fights with
monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou
gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee." (Nietzsche
& Zimmern, 1997, p. 52) Building on Nietzsche, I surmise the reason for
our collective spiral into distrust, fueling anti-immigrant populist
rhetoric, reflects how misinformation embodies the tale of the
mythological hydra. What I mean is, [when you cut one head off -- three
grow back to replace it]{.underline}. Similarly, [when attempting to
debunk blatantly false narratives, it only feeds further into
conspiratorial rhetoric, reinforcing the person's views that they are
getting confronted because what they view is correct.
**[Exchanges]{.mark}**]{.underline} like this [**[rob]{.mark} potential
[discourse of being]{.mark} [constructive and cannot]{.mark} reasonably
[assess]{.mark} the [credibility of varied points of
view]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Moreover, [**[cognitive dissonance
is]{.mark} a [powerful]{.mark} influence on the mind [causing
hesitations]{.mark} [regarding]{.mark} the [credibility of contradictory
information]{.mark}, especially [pertaining to
conspiracies]{.mark}**.]{.underline} (Leman & Cinnirella, 2013) A
typical interaction I have personally experienced many times manifests
as such:

One person critical of conspiratorial narratives can say, "Not
everything is intentional, and not everything has meaning," referring to
some real or imagined cabal, deep state, or conniving billionaire
suiting their predispositions (Soros, Gates, Zuckerberg, Musk, Bezos,
Trump, etc.) In response, the person defending their blatantly false
views can say, "Well... that is just your opinion," "You fell for the
misinformation," or "I did my research, you should do yours."

The distrust is so pervasive that even asking for sources for the
'research' is met with hostility, contempt, or stonewalling. As a
result, honest and credible debate cannot occur when the very foundation
the conversation rests on is negated through open-ended Socratic style
musings that talking heads like Tucker Carleson implore regularly.
(Kaufman, 2021; AP, 2020) To clarify precisely how this presents itself,
suppose I ask you, "are illegal aliens a burden to our country?" This is
precisely the bad faith musings that presuppose a determined answer. By
calling migrants, refugees, or asylum speakers' illegal aliens,' you are
already denoting them in a negative light, grouping distinct cases into
a bundle premised on the negation of the group's humanity. Additionally,
by using loaded words like 'burden' with negative connotations, the
answer is built into the question. Unfortunately, despite various
politicians, NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and citizens'
repeated assurances that it is absurd to give this type of discourse
credence, one must never forget -- even the road to hell is paved with
good intentions. Interestingly, Swami et al. (2012) demonstrated in a
controlled study how belief in entirely fictitious conspiracy theory was
significantly associated with stronger belief in other real‐world
conspiracy theories, stronger paranormal beliefs, and lower crystallized
intelligence. Nevertheless[, we must remember **[these subtle
influences]{.mark}** that guide the narratives we tell ourselves and
society collectively **[are]{.mark}** not spirits, hydras, or demons but
rather,]{.underline}

"[**[bots]{.mark} and [opaque algorithmic processes]{.mark}**,
which]{.underline} alternately and capriciously [curse or bless
us]{.underline}. One such force is, of course, Internet memes and online
content generally. Amplified and circulated by complex proprietary
information platforms hidden behind corporate obfuscation and often too
complicated even for their own engineers to fully comprehend, these
systems make their users vulnerable to external predation by harmful
forms of social influence. [The common factor in all the fears about
rampaging memes is the belief that memes are like magic, with powers to
cause real-world effects."]{.underline} (Elkus, 2021)

#### Disability studies is essential to their paradigm of bioethics -- without it biotechnology will inevitably regress onto the structures of disability that pathologize and normalize unequal power relations.

**[[Disability studies and biomedical ethics]{.underline}]{.mark}** have
each been criticized for their respective omissions of the experiences,
concerns, and contributions of people of color. Throughout the 1990s and
2000s, scholars began demonstrating that the first-person accounts,
normative guidelines, and framings of embodiment within these
interdisciplinary fields **[[tend]{.underline}]{.mark}**ed **[[to
prioritize the experiences of disability, pain, illness, health, and
clinical treatment from a white perspective]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(e.g., Myser 2003; Bell 2006)[.]{.mark} In response, both fields have
attempted to transform the focus of their research, activism, and
clinical guidelines to include historical and present patterns of
neglect, oversight, and harm impacting communities of color. Both fields
have also begun to highlight insights, methods, and political strategies
employed by people of color within disability activism and clinical
settings. The cross-pollination of these fields of study occurred during
the mid-1990s through the development of disability bioethics, even
prior to coinage of the term "disability bioethics." This new area of
**[[research]{.mark} [urged]{.mark} [practitioners]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[understand]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[importance]{.mark}
[of]{.mark}]{.underline}** insights and methodologies from
**[[disability studies within]{.mark}]{.underline}** the formation and
regulation of ethical guidelines and clinical practices in
[**[biomedicine]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Such insights included,
specifically, **[[that the experiences]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
contributions **[[of disabled people are necessary in the field of
bioethics.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Regarding race, founding theorists of
disability bioethics engaged race and racism to varying degrees in their
respective writings. For example, Rosemarie Garland-Thomson has been
described by Sami Schalk as "one of the first disability studies
scholars to provide sustained race and disability analysis in the final
chapter of her book Extraordinary Bodies, published in 1997" (Schalk
2018, 10). Accordingly, **[[disability bioethics]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
as this volume suggests, from its inception
**[[has]{.underline}]{.mark}** attempted to **[[examine the intricacies
and structural conditions of race and racism within the biomedical
sciences.]{.underline}]{.mark}** As a brief caveat, it is important to
note that, although the focus of this chapter is on race, disability,
and bioethics, the study of the [**[intersection of race and disability
exceeds the scope of the biomedical sciences]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
That is, as Shelley Tremain (2017) has cautioned her readers, **[[to
reduce disability to biomedical]{.underline}]{.mark}** and health
**[[discourses]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [to]{.mark}]{.underline}**
potentially **[[reify]{.underline}]{.mark}** the broader
**[[societal]{.mark} [and historical]{.mark} [conditions]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} [shape]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
**[[pathologizing]{.mark} [and]{.mark}]{.underline}**/or [**[normalizing
relations of power that negatively impact disabled
people]{.underline}**.]{.mark} For this reason, although the focus of
this volume is on disability bioethics, uncovering the broader relevance
of the intersection of disability and race beyond medical and health
discourses remains an important ongoing project. Accordingly, the
analysis offered here will be limited, but will serve as a piece of a
broader scholarly and political movement focusing on the relationships
between race and disability more generally. To foreground a disability
bioethics that grapples with the structural and intimate presence of
oppression in its many valences and that emphasizes the lives and work
of disabled people of color, this chapter focuses on two overlapping
areas that thread together disability studies, bioethics, and critical
approaches to race. First, the chapter examines work addressing the
existential and conceptual relationships between race and disability.
This section underscores writings by authors who analyze embodied
experiences of community belonging, illness, pain, motility, madness,
desire, futurity, and barriers to affirmation and care, all of which are
in conversation with processes of racialization. Building on this
discussion, the second section shifts to a focus on race and
institutions. This section includes an examination of the functions of
disability and race in contexts of clinical diagnosis and treatment,
medical education and research, as well as disability and health
activist movements that have challenged systemic oppressions impacting
communities of color. I Existential/Conceptual Analyses of Race and
Disability within Biomedical Ethics As noted above, recognizing the
necessity and value of the perspectives of disabled people has been a
critical turn that distinguishes **[[disability
studies]{.underline}]{.mark}** more generally, and has surfaced within
bioethics more recently. The common English-language refrain within
disability rights activism since the 1990s "Nothing about us without us"
**[[presents a demand for policymakers, theorists, and organizers to
prioritize the experiences, worldviews, and resources of people who
identify as disabled or who may be socially marked as disabled or
debilitated.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Likewise, **[[critical race
studies]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Indigenous studies
**[[have]{.underline}]{.mark}** long recognized the need to
[**[prioritize]{.underline}** **[the perspectives of people of color and
Indigenous peoples to avoid the exoticizing, commodifying, or otherwise
misinformed views developed within the anthropological, biological, and
medical sciences.]{.underline}**]{.mark} Social epistemologist, Charles
Mills (1998), for example, considers the novel Invisible Man by Ralph
Ellison a classic illustration of the existential conditions of Black
Americans who have experienced patterned epistemic erasure and
invalidation by white Americans. Or, as Anishinaabe theorist and
literary author, Gerald Vizenor (1994) proposes, the fact that vastly
distinct Indigenous societies of the Americas have been placed under one
homogeneous label "Indian" has required Native peoples to devise
"postindian" strategies to subvert and survive the damage caused by
settler colonial imaginaries. Given this shared methodological stance
across these fields, we find the study of race, disability, and the
biomedical sciences similarly taking on such a priority. As such, we can
turn to accounts of **[[the relationship between race and
disability]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
**[[explore]{.underline}]{.mark}** the existential and **[[conceptual
conditions of encounters with]{.underline}]{.mark}** clinical,
**[[research]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}]{.underline}** other **[[medical
settings.]{.underline}]{.mark}** First, regarding existential conditions
that frame the interconnected relationships between race and disability
within biomedical contexts, a number of theorists have explored the
differing forms of medical treatment, attitudes and expectations of
medical providers, and the everyday forms disregard for people of color
within clinical settings. Notably, women of color authors of the
1970s--1990s utilized descriptions of embodied pain, illness, and
disability to critique heterosexual norms and post-racial framings of
**[["color blindness" within medical settings]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Pueblo) each respond, in differing ways, to
**[[conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}** of **[[pathologization and
debilitation impacting communities of color.]{.underline}]{.mark}** For
example, Lorde's The Cancer Journals (1980) analyzes the author's
experiences of breast cancer, including biopsy, diagnosis, and
mastectomy, and the text documents her refusal to be objectified or
shamed within the clinical encounters that she endures. She describes
her experience of breast cancer as stemming explicitly from a Black
lesbian feminist perspective, and the text is framed throughout by
excerpts from the author's journal from the years 1978--1980. Seizing
control of her narrative, Lorde opens The Cancer Journals by describing
the "transformation of silence into language and action" (18).
Specifically, she outlines the double binds often experienced by Black
women, including their hypervisibility and simultaneous invisibility
within allied political movements with white women. Within such
settings, Black women, she writes, have had to fight and still do, for
that very visibility which also renders us most vulnerable, our
blackness. For to survive in the mouth of this dragon we call america
\[sic\], we have had to learn this first and most vital lesson---that we
were never meant to survive. (21, 17) Against this deathly tendency, she
states, survival depends on "teach\[ing\] by living and speaking those
truths which we believe and know beyond understanding" (22). In the
context of The Cancer Journals, she intimates that writing about her
experiences with breast cancer, including the patterned harms that she
underwent within the clinical setting, is vital to her own survival and
to the survival of other Black women. Additionally, "know\[ing\] without
understanding" appears to refer to the inchoate existential awareness of
one's own sensations, emotions, and other embodied experiences,
experiences that are not fully transparent to oneself or others.
According to Lorde, **[[the act of bringing such pre- or non-discursive
forms of awareness, including experiences of pain and illness, into
expression becomes a method to reshape personal and collective
possibilities.]{.underline}]{.mark}** On this point, Therí A. Pickens
(2014) notes that Lorde "wrestles with the appropriate ethical response
to her pain" and configures her writings as a means "to move toward
awareness, discussion, and activism" (130--131). The importance of
highlighting such a relationship between pain and expression is that
Lorde is able to demonstrate the many ways in which Black lesbian women
struggle through cancer and amputation. Among the themes that emerge in
Lorde's work is the dominance of the medical establishment over
patients' own narrative descriptions. Thus, describing her pain through
evocations of joy and sensuality, including phantom pains, becomes a
resistant act against the power of clinical medicine's force relations.
For example, after her mastectomy, Lorde writes that "the pain returned
home bringing all of its kinfolk" (Lorde 2014, 31--32). Through drawing
on familiar vernacular, Lorde's description serves as a response to
**[[the insufficiency of medical discourses to describe the experiences
of Black American women in pain]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Pickens 2014,
132). The Cancer Journals also underscores Lorde's decision not to wear
a prosthesis following her mastectomy. Specifically, nurses and
volunteer staff encourage her to wear a pink prosthetic breast following
her surgery, and the reasons offered are that such a prosthesis will
make Lorde and others around her feel more comfortable (1980, 42).
**[[The artificiality of]{.mark} [the]{.mark}]{.underline}** pink
[**[prosthetic]{.underline}**]{.mark} contrasts with Lorde's
descriptions of her own "soft brown skin" after surgery, and her
**[[remarks]{.mark} [critique the white aesthetic norms that exist
within biomedical technologies of the flesh]{.mark}]{.underline}** (44).
Pickens also notes the heteronormative encounters Lorde describes while
being encouraged to wear the prosthesis, including the suggestions by
medical staff that wearing the prosthesis would allow her to remain
attractive to men (2014, 135). In these ways, Lorde's writings refuse
these tendencies to foreclose her own appreciation of her body and
desires, and her descriptions reopen a discursive space for a
distinctively Black lesbian response to the misunderstandings and
erasures that stem from the medical world around her. As such, Lorde's
writings offer a counternarrative to the whiteness of clinical medicine,
and provide a descriptive opening for the existential conditions of
illness, pain, and pathologization experienced by queer women of color.
Alongside the pivotal work by Black, Indigenous, and other women of
color in the 1970s and 1980s, more recent scholarly and activist work
operating through framings of disability justice has focused on the
specific existential and conceptual tools necessary for disabled, queer
and trans people of color. For example, although authors like Lorde and
Gloria Anzaldúa wrote extensively of experiences of illness, medical
intervention, pain, and blindness, these authors were often reluctant to
interpret themselves in terms of "disability" or as "disabled." Along
these lines, Moya Bailey and Izetta Autumn Mobley (2019) and Aurora
Levins Morales (2013) have respectively explored the **[[relationships
between race and disability]{.mark}, [examining the reasons why people
of color may choose not to politically organize around disability rights
or through identification as "disabled."]{.mark}]{.underline}** Namely,
Bailey and Mobley note that tropes of the "crazy Black woman" are
weaponized against Black women leading to high rates of violence
committed against them, and that such violence occurs **[[while
simultaneously failing to address the needs of Black people with
psychiatric or physical disabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** (2019,
31)[.]{.mark} Additionally, they point out that: Black women and other
women of color do most of the labor in the service of disability despite
the impact on their ability to care for themselves or their families.
Caregivers are often engaged in debilitating work for disabled people
and become disabled themselves. (32) These
**[[concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}**, along with others, may thus
**[[complicate political]{.mark}]{.underline}** and personal
**[[mobilization through a framing of disability for people of
color.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Bailey and Mobley also note, however, that
growing work is currently being done among Black authors and activists
to explore the terms of a disability within Black communities, including
as their work attests, developing a Black feminist disability framework
from which to theorize and mobilize. Along similar lines, Morales notes
that for Gloria Anzaldúa, as a "dark-skinned working class Tejana
lesbian," to have affirmed disability as an identity would likely have
required "a strong, vocal, politically sophisticated, disability justice
movement led by queer working class women and trans people of color who
understood \[her\] life" (2013, 5). From this insight, Bailey and
Mobley, as well as disability justice activists have resisted
individualist rights- and autonomy-based models of justice to focus on
collective resistance to ableism in its many instantiations. Instead,
**[[disability justice activists and scholars demand a recognition of
the interdependence of shared struggles against systemic oppressions and
how disability functions across all forms of
oppression]{.underline}]{.mark}**---all of this **[[while
foregrounding]{.underline}]{.mark}** the desires, joys, and **[[networks
of care among disabled people who are fighting against those systemic
oppressions.]{.underline}]{.mark}** For example, disability justice
organizers Talila A. Lewis and Dustin P. Gibson, through their social
media, workshops, and collective public actions, offer powerful
critiques of the forms of systemic ableism that undergird US prison
systems and policing, while also dedicating time and energy to curate
Black disability solidarity music, art, film, and history (Lewis 2020;
Gibson 2020). Additionally, Sins Invalid, founded in 2005 by disability
justice activists Patty Berne and LeRoy F. Moore, is a performance-based
artist collective composed of artists of color and LGBTQ/gender-variant
artists that explores themes of sexuality, the non-normative body, and
social and economic justice through their performances and workshops
(Sins Invalid 2020). These examples of disability justice activism thus
illustrate the important point made by Bailey and Mobley that there are
creative aesthetic, embodied, and political contributions founded in the
experiences of disabled people of color, and that **[[organizing work
done within a disability justice framework celebrates both the lives and
experiences of disabled people of color while also critiquing the very
systematic patterns of harm that would seek to erase, reduce, or
eliminate their very existence.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Lastly, regarding
the relationship between disability and race, Nirmala Erevelles (2011)
explores the **["racialization of disability" and the "dis-abilization
of race,"]{.underline}** a process that Erevelles offers to bring both
categories into material relation. Specifically, she argues that
**[[whiteness, defended as a form of property right, is "the ideological
discourse that has been used to justify the racial superiority of white
people over people of color by using the logic of
dis-ability]{.underline}]{.mark}** (e.g., inferior genes, low IQ) **[[to
decide who has the rights to citizenship"]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(166)[.]{.mark} By this, Erevelles suggests that the **[[racialization
of disability is the process by which white]{.mark},]{.underline}**
able-bodied heterosexual cisgender **[[men]{.mark}
[become]{.mark}]{.underline}** centered as the **[[most
productive]{.underline}]{.mark}** (and thereby valuable)
**[[citizens]{.underline}]{.mark}** within capitalist
societies[.]{.mark} In this, **[[the]{.mark} [productive
possibilities]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline}** such **[[white
citizens]{.mark} [are]{.mark} [protected]{.mark} [through]{.mark}
[institutions]{.mark} [such]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[as]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[law]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
education, and health care[.]{.mark} Regarding education, for example,
the criminalization and pathologization of Black children in k-12
settings, as well as the segregation of educational institutions by
"cognitive ability" seeks to shore up protected educational resources
for those deemed more deserving or more capable of making "positive"
contributions to society. Regarding the dis-abilization of race,
Erevelles notes that people considered outside the productive metrics of
advanced capitalism are often relegated to the welfare state, and
thereby stigmatized as burdensome on the civic body. The responses to
such so-called "dependency" on social welfare programs, however, is also
a lucrative business, she argues. Testing companies, metrics and
measurements for success, juvenile detention facilities, and other
programs designed to manage or "uplift" children of color effectively
foreground a life marked by pathologization and deviance for many
people. Moreover, Erevelles proposes that the debilitating conditions of
labor for many people of color in the USA also lead to increased
marginalization, vulnerability, and medical precarity for such
populations within advanced capitalism.

#### Disability is not solely a material codification but operates on invisible registers which doom its subjects to endless encounters with ableism.

In the literature on diversity, a significant amount of work has been
undertaken on issues of racism, sexism, and more recently, heterosexism,
and their corresponding privileges. However, despite discussion on
disability being more than decades old, with the mainstream disability
rights movement gaining momentum in the 1960s and 1970s (Wolbring,
2012), and the Americans with Disabilities Act having been enacted in
1990 (United States Code, 2008), notably **[[less academic literature
has addressed ableism]{.mark},]{.underline}** particularly within the
field of social work. **[[Even disability policy as an area of focus in
the literature is relatively new, given the large number of disabled
individuals in the United States]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Schriner,
1990)**[[.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This study examines whether and how
the experiences of ableism by people with invisible disabilities
(someone who might not be assumed to be disabled at first meeting, such
as individuals with chronic pain, traumatic brain injury, multiple
sclerosis, HIV, etc.) are disparate from those whose disabilities may be
more evident to others. Although members of this community use both
identity-first (disabled people) and person-first (people with
disabilities \[PWD\]) language (Dunn & Andrews, 2015), this article will
focus primarily on identity-first language, as this language comes from
a self-determination paradigm in line with both social work and feminist
values (Ladau, 2014; National Association of Social Workers, 2017). The
United States Census Bureau (2012) reported that in the 2010 Census,
21.3% of those of age 15 years and older had a disability or impairment.
From these statistics, it can be inferred that approximately one fifth
of U.S. residents are currently living with a disability or impairment.
**[[Disability]{.underline}]{.mark}** in and of itself **[[is a
community with blurred lines---people can acquire
disabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** (both short term and long term)
t**[[hroughout their lives, making the concept of membership to the
disabled community one that is frequently difficult for other
marginalized groups to understand]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Davis,
1999)**[[.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Although **[[individuals with
"invisible" disabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** (those that are not
always, or ever, apparent to others) may not receive as much overt or
explicit social stigma as those with more apparent disabilities, they
**[[are still exposed to forms of rejection, ableism, and
discrimination;]{.underline}]{.mark}** in fact, **[[they may even have
more trouble accessing support services than their visibly disabled
counterparts due to being expected to prove their
disability]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Davis, 2005**[)[.]{.mark} [Disabled
individuals with invisible disabilities may struggle with "passing" as
nondisabled]{.mark}]{.underline}** persons in many settings (Samuels,
2003**[)[. While passing may be seen as a privilege, it can also be a
challenge for these individuals to find community and be validated by
disabled people.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The decision on whether to pass
or not comes with not only personal implications of stigma and
discrimination but also more societal and political implications of
outing themselves as disabled (Brune & Wilson, 2013). **[[They may also
have issues in accessing the services, support structure, and even
physical spaces that they need, given assumptions about what their
bodies and minds are able to do, and whether those given the power to
make the distinction decide whether they are "disabled
enough"]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Lightman, Vick, Herd, & Mitchell, 2009).
Therefore, it is possible that members of this community experience
ableism in different ways than those who have apparent disabilities.
Ableism is the overarching act of prejudice and/or discrimination
against disabled people and the devaluation of disability (Hehir, 2002)
and corresponds with able-bodied/neurotypical privilege, the set of
unearned privileges held by nondisabled individuals. They are both
interconnected systems that maintain stratification around disability.
Ableism values physical, emotional, and mental capital, following
socially constructed expectations of ability (Loja, Costa, Hughes, &
Menezes, 2013). Queer/disability theorist McRuer (2006) posits that like
the ideal of compulsory heterosexuality, **[[ableism results in a
compulsory able-bodiedness, demanding that disabled individuals do
whatever it takes to enact a nondisabled identity however
possible.]{.mark}]{.underline}** While sexism, racism, and other isms
certainly are prevalent in all types of systems and interactions,
Wolbring (2008) argues that ableism is one of the most accepted and
widespread isms in society and works in conjunction with many other
isms. Because of the lack of conversation around ableism and
able-bodied/neurotypical privilege, prejudice against disabled people
may at times be more prevalent and socially acceptable than many others
types of prejudice (Ford, 2009). Although **[[ableism is insidious and
apparent in all aspects of society]{.mark}, [little research has been
conducted to understand the lived experiences of ableism by disabled
individuals, nuanced disabled identities]{.mark}]{.underline}** (such as
those who have invisible/less obvious disabilities**[)[,]{.mark} [and
intersections of other marginalized identities with disability
identities.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Moreover, while there have been some
publications in the field of social work around ableism, much of it
focuses on policy (El-Lahib & Wehbi, 2012), sanism (discrimination
around mental health) specifically (Poole et al., 2012), or the general
need for better culture competency in social work practice and education
regarding disabled populations (Carter, Hanes, & MacDonald, 2012;
Dupre´, 2012). Disabled individuals also experience higher rates of
poverty and chronic health issues than their nondisabled counterparts
(Hehir, 2002; Roux et al., 2001; Storey, 2007), and there are few
instances of social work around the experiences of disabled people of
color, transgender disabled people, and the ways that other marginalized
identities interplay with disability and ableism. Feminist
**[[disability scholars]{.underline}]{.mark}** in particular **[[have
brought up the need for intersectional frameworks and connecting
disability to conversations around diversity]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Kafer, 2013; McRuer, 2002; Olkin, 2002). In Feminist, Queer, Crip,
feminist disability studies, scholar Kafer (2013) explains that not only
did feminist theory gave her the ability to critically examine notation
of disability but also emphasizes the bridge between theory and
practice, something incredibly relevant to the discussion of disability
and ableism in social work. Microaggressions: Death by a Thousand
Papercuts The concept of **[[microaggressions is used to explain the
phenomena of the implicit perpetuation of]{.underline}]{.mark}** racism,
sexism, heterocentrism, transphobia, anti-Semitism, and other **[[forms
of power and oppression in society]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Sue, 2010).
Microaggressions are everyday interactions that perpetuate inequalities
and stereotypes against people who belong to marginalized communities
(Solo´ rzano, Ceja, & Yosso, 2000; Sue, 2010). They are perpetuated
against many individuals holding many different identities, including
race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and disability (Solo´ rzano
et al., 2000; Sue, 2010). **[[Frequent exposure to]{.mark}
microaggressions, including a[bleist microaggressions, can result in
higher incidence of negative mental health outcomes, feelings of being
excluded, and lower positive outcomes including reduced academic
performance]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Khattari, 2017; Nadal, Griffin,
Wong, Hamit, & Rasmus, 2014). **[[Microaggressions are a common means of
perpetuating ableism.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[These may include
telling someone that they speak very well for a deaf person, telling
someone they are lucky to get to bring their dog everywhere with them,
asking a group of people to all stand for an activity (making the
assumption that everyone can stand), or making a joke about how fast
someone can go in their wheelchair]{.underline}** (Storey, 2007). Many
of these microaggressions are a result of assumptions about disabled
people. Storey (2007) found that **[[perpetuation of these
microaggressions]{.underline}]{.mark}** and assumptions **[[result in
disabled people feeling excluded or unwelcome in educational settings
and]{.mark} [produce]{.mark}]{.underline}** outcomes including
**[[anger, frustration, and other feelings that can be harmful to an
individual's engagement with their community.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Invisible Disabilities **[[People with invisible
disabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** or illness may be **[[more likely to
experience ableism indirectly]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including through
ableist microaggressions. For example, **[[while someone might not use
language]{.mark} like "lame" [in front of someone]{.mark} [they]{.mark}
[perceive]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [be]{.mark} [mobility impaired,
they]{.mark} [may]{.mark} [be less reticent to use]{.mark} such
[language]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [front of]{.mark} those they identify as
[nondisabled]{.mark}]{.underline}**, whether or not those individuals
actually are. Additionally, people with invisible disabilities may
experience ableism when using adaptations for PWD, such as
disability-designated parking spaces or elevators, when others view them
as nondisabled individuals. It is possible that **[[this is a result of
unintentionally fulfilling the role of compulsory
able-bodiedness]{.underline}]{.mark}** suggested by McRuer (2006),
simple **[[by not having disabilities that might make themselves visibly
distinct as disabled to outsiders.]{.mark} [Disabled bodies
are]{.mark}]{.underline}** frequently othered and **[[feared by
society]{.underline}]{.mark}** at large (Hirschmann, 2013),
**[[but]{.mark} [there]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [little]{.mark}
[knowledge]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [how]{.mark} [this]{.mark}]{.underline}**
may be **[[experienced]{.mark} [by those with
invisible]{.mark}]{.underline}** physical
**[[disabilities.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Mad studies, a subset of
disabilities focusing on mental health and sanism, have noted
similarities in the "coming out and facing stigma/not being out and
facing different marginalization" decision as faced by other individuals
with sometimes invisible identities (Pilling, 2012). Therefore research
is needed to help understand how disabled individuals who may not be
read as disabled experience ableism in their lives. **[[Bridging the
theoretical understanding of ableism into the lived experiences of this
community is a crucial move forward in creating more disability
inclusive]{.underline}]{.mark}** social work
**[[practice.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This study explores the experiences
of ableism specifically for individuals with invisible disabilities
because, given that this invisibility often prevents these individual
from being viewed as disabled, it is likely that their experiences may
differ from disabled individuals with more apparent disabilities.

#### Moves towards progress through an embracement of a collective humanity relies on an Enlightenment reading of humanism that is incoherent for accounting for black disabled life. Black life is not locked into the position of being fully human nor fully slave; instead you should understand black life as lived within social death.

Blackness", Duke University Press, Durham and London, pgs. 74-78, JMH\]

[The ideological conceit of the human materializes at every turn. It
operates as the main thrust of an argument about the (in)validity of
Black and mad subjects' existence. As it becomes an appeal to or for a
purported universal experience, it ironically denies some humans a
humanity according to Western European ideals, which are fundamentally
anti-Black and sanist]{.underline}. Since it masquerades as normalcy, it
insidiously functions as an apparition---ghosting a text or an event.
Conceptually, [[humanity]{.mark} separates the human from flora and
fauna and ostensibly [guarantees that a human will be thought of as an
autonomous subject]{.mark}, operating [with agency]{.mark} [and securing
the legal, social, cultural, political, and material conditions]{.mark}
to do so.]{.underline} [**[For mad Black subjects]{.mark}, [this
definition of the human does not apply.]{.mark}** This [understanding of
humanity, forged in the crucible of the Enlightenment period]{.mark},
undergirds our analytic praxis as well.]{.underline} Its materiality
affects the access Black mad subjects are granted to particular
conditions and, as a discursive construct, adherence to it affects the
theoretical paradigms with which we work in literary criticism. [This is
the break where the criticism reveals itself to itself: [this notion of
humanity]{.mark} lingers in the criticism that art---exclusive to
humans, of course---[must have specific characteristics]{.mark}
(formalism).]{.underline} As the previous conversation intimates, it
subtends our attention to and preoccupation with ocularity and the logos
(deconstruction, structuralism). [It assumes that readers' seldom
autonomous interpretations evince the value of meaning in a text
(reader-oriented criticism). It occupies our concerns about interiority
(psychoanalysis) and labor (Marxism) since it finds critical purchase in
the energy expended by certain human bodies and minds (feminist
criticism, queer studies, disability studies, ethnic studies,
etc.).]{.underline} Sedimented within our interpretive strategies and
invested with promise--- so much so since we refer to ourselves as
humanists---the concept of the human becomes nearly impossible to
critically examine. [The ideology of the human carries with it an
exclusivity: namely, that the category of human belongs solely to a
figure Rosemarie Garland Thomson terms the normate]{.underline}. Such a
figure---white, male, cis gendered, straight, able-bodied, Protestant---
excludes multiple identity categories on its face.1 **[[Because of its
origins in the Enlightenment and entanglement with the Middle Passage,
eugenics, imperialism/colonialism, and the carceral system, the human
poses a set of ontic and narratological problems for Black madness and
mad Blackness]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [In the previous conversations
within this text we've seen how the concept of the human could be opened
up, the cut widened, when an artist-theorist places Blackness and
madness at the center rather than the periphery.]{.underline} For
instance, [Butler uses Ina to theorize about the constellation of
intimate relationships available when Blackness and madness form the
crux of a new identity.]{.underline} Hopkinson's cognitively disabled
and mentally ill characters shift the narratological terrain when their
specific minds become the locus of the novel. Each artist-theorist
questions how capacious the category of human can be. [What boundaries
keep humans fundamentally human? If remaining human is possible or
preferable, what exactly does it mean to be one? How might we read and
interpret if we cannot assume the validity of the human?]{.underline}
Following a politics of curiosity,2 I conjecture about what it might
mean to unmake madness and Blackness, detract from the critical and
narrative power each has accrued as derogatory. [Though I consider that
both discourses were fomented in the Enlightenment as a way of defining
and disciplining nonnormative bodies, I am not interested in turning to
con versations between Enlightenment thinkers (or those wrestling within
that tradition). **[I am much more interested in the critical gaps and
folds explored by Black studies and disability studies
thinkers]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Their analyses invaginate our
discussions, forcing us to examine how we think about madness and
Blackness in a world hostile to them. [This discussion comes from two
strains: one, from the previous conversations in this project in which
nonhuman characters populate the landscape, and, two, from a larger
conversation beyond this project about the potential of madness and
Blackness to be disruptive once one divests from the human as a category
or concept.]{.underline} I [[turn to those in disability and Black
studies who have theorized about the creation of human and humanity as a
concept vis-à-vis madness and Blackness.]{.mark} I purpose to trace
their understanding of this concept and, since the two have often
implicated but not involved each other, I also aim to find the common
conceptual ground between them.3]{.underline} Last, I turn to
artist-theorist Tananarive Due's African Immortals series as a mad Black
text that operates as a heuristic, questions the validity of human as a
concept, and explores the repercussions of abandoning it. [Though I read
the text as a set of experiments, I concentrate on a few overarching
story lines---desiring [Blackness, understanding the ideology of
ability, and forming new interpretive strategies]{.mark}---that question
whether the conception of the human has particular narrative
power.]{.underline} Other F-Words: Fugitivity, Fungibility, & Futility
Scholars within Black studies have long contested the category of human
for Black people. Sylvia Wynter's oeuvre contains a rigorous and adroit
critique of this concept, designating the human as a localized Judeo
Christian concept that she terms Man.4 [She traces it through the
Enlightenment to the late twentieth-century Caribbean, citing that the
human was ideologically designed to exclude Indigenous people and
Blacks.5 There could be no room for those whose subjugation made
colonial and imperial life possible.]{.underline} To be clear, this
subjugation was not simply about putting those bodies to work, and
harnessing their labor, but also about the intellectual subjugation and
cultural denigration of those bodies. [**They had to be deployed in
service of the colonial and imperial subject physically, and
simultaneously disregarded as a space of intellectual and cultural
complexity.** [The prohibitions against reading,]{.mark} gathering, and
marriage (just to name a few) ensured that the Black cultural and social
institutions developed did not carry with them the validating stamp of
approval from social institutions that had power.]{.underline}
[[Excising Blackness from histories]{.mark} (read: time) [makes
permissible the kind of erasure that facilitates thinking of Blacks as
outside the realm of the human]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, [[the
emphasis on labor sustained]{.mark} a set of practices that sought to
create [a permanent underclass]{.mark} from the antebellum period to the
present. Blackness then not only bears the mark of being thought of as
having a fundamental lack of humanity, but that lack is determined, and
circumscribed, by fungibility and fugitivity. **[Race,]{.mark} then,
[and Blackness specifically, determines who lives and who
dies.]{.mark}**]{.underline}6 As a result of this thanatological
constraint, [Blackness remains exteriorized, consistently unaccounted
for in the construction of the modern world.7]{.underline} Even after
Man, to deploy the term in Wynter's lexicon for the human, definitions
of Blackness must contend with abjection. [[The analytical praxis
consistently turns]{.mark} and returns [to the areas where Blackness has
a circumscribed agency, limns a limited radicality, and remains enmeshed
with histories of violence and degradation]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Scholars differ on their responses to abjection such that some attempt
to maneuver out of it, and others accept it as part of the experiences
of Blackness. To be clear, [accepting abjection is not]{.mark}
equivalent to [accepting institutionalized racism]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Instead**[, [it requires viewing Black social life as lived in light of
social death]{.mark},8 or [finding freedom in unfreedom]{.mark}. Jared
Y. Sexton's notion that Blacks live in light of social death dovetails
with Fred Moten's understanding of freedom in unfreedom in one crucial
way: that [abjection must be circumnavigated if one
exists]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The difference between the two scholars'
arguments resides in how that navigation takes place and with what
affective residues[. That is, radicality and resistance evince an
ontology circumscribed by the discourses of fugitivity and fungibility.
Locating the origins of these discourses in the antebellum period, some
scholars also find that [abjection must be understood as a fundamental
aspect of Black life]{.mark} post--Middle Passage.]{.underline} These
scholars--- among them Kimberly Juanita Brown, Saidiya Hartman,
Christina Sharpe, Hortense Spillers, and Alexander Weheliye---all
understand the long reach of the antebellum period as having direct
repercussions to how Black life functions currently. [**[Slavery]{.mark}
as a vast hemispheric project [fundamentally shapes how Blacknesses
operate discursively and materially]{.mark}.9** The residues of
unspoken, ethical grammars force those who find some degree of
maneuverability possible to wrestle with some exigencies, such as the
queered and erotic Black/white encounter or the presumed degradation of
male rape as a locus of Black radical power.10]{.underline} Man tethers
itself to Blackness through abjec tion, requiring Blackness to make
meaning through a grammar that enfolds within it the resistance to
itself. [Abjection becomes the facet of Blackness (not Blackness in
toto) typified by the fact that "[you can't win. You can't break
even.]{.mark} And, [you can't get out of the game."1]{.mark}1 Whereas
the field of Black studies has chosen to question the validity of the
human as a concept, disability studies has taken a decidedly different
strategy. Disability studies makes a particular claim on the human even
as it acknowledges that the category excludes disability as a matter of
course.]{.underline} For instance, myriad scholars clarify that the
conception of health and ability determines who is included and who is
worthy of living. Lives thought to be too painful, deformed, or
requiring too much medical intervention often fight for the right to
live at all.12 **[The typical disability studies response has been to
depict disability as a part of human variance, a part of the spectrum of
human experience. This particular formulation correlates to the idea
that if one lives long enough, one will become disabled.]{.underline}**
The kingdom of the sick, as Sontag puts it, always welcomes new visitors
and permanent residents.13 Undergirding this idea is the conception of
the human as potentially inclusive of disability, where disability can
function as an absent presence. [According to disability studies
scholars, this absent presence surfaces in narrative, art, and rhetoric,
among other cultural and social spaces. For instance, the Venus de Milo
makes its current claim to beauty based on its amputee
status.14]{.underline} In Keywords for Disability Studies, the entry on
aesthetics positions disability as hopeful prospect despite its position
and history: "The close proximity of aesthetic judgment to carceral
isolation and rationalized euthanasia is the darker side of
Enlightenment knowledge, even as the increased visibility of the
disabled body creates the occasion for its liberation."15 [Narrative
relies on intellectual disability even when it is not named as such or
embodied within a character.16 Communication requires the disabled body
to establish itself not only as coherent but also saleable in terms of
diversity.17 In each of these instances, the human is a category to
which disabled people already belong, albeit in abjected and absented
form. The idea is not only that the human relies on disability to
perform conceptual work but also that enfolded into the human is the
experience of disability.]{.underline}

#### Our embracement of Black madness :: mad blackness operates as a discursive move against the imposition of whiteness and being able bodied through speaking on realities that are inherently unspeakable. Absent this mode of analysis, logics of white eugenics will lock mad blackness into a position of unfreedom.

[Seemingly in answer to Bell's work, scholars developed a reading
strategy that clarifies how race and disability operate: mutual
constitution.]{.underline} Specifically, mutual constitution impresses
upon readers how these two discourses operate as interrelated and
simultaneously present. [This reading strategy performs several useful
functions within the scholarship. In the interest of carving space to
examine our critical conversations and open them up with the work of
artists-theorists, I turn to several key moments in our use of mutual
constitution to think through when it works and when it does
not]{.underline}. This critical reading strategy becomes useful when
understanding how disability has been used as a discursive tool. For
example, [racial and gendered groups have tended to justify their cases
for civil rights in opposition to individuals with disabilities. The
rhetorical invocation of disability here only functions to undergird the
validity of another people groups' personhood]{.underline} (at the
expense of the personhood of the disabled).4 **[[Disability]{.mark}, in
this case, [does not quite exist as a material reality but rather as a
hauntological presence that helps create race and gender]{.mark},
sometimes as superlative. In thinking of race and disability as
material, [one must consider that contexts of oppression and war create
disability]{.mark}, often with detrimental effects on those already
disenfranchised by institutional racism.]{.underline}**5 In this case,
[[disability shores up the physical evidence of institutionalized
racism]{.mark} and systemic injustice, helping to define race as a
matter of life and death. In addition to highlighting the discursive and
material effects of race and disability in tandem, [such
mutuality]{.mark} also [serves an argumentative
function]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since it is a critical reading practice,
it also shapes how critics write about the two subjects. [This project,
in its interest in openoing up the critical literature to itself,
invests in discussing this as a writing and reading strategy for how it
roadmaps intellectual possibility (and, as the metaphor goes, closes off
certain avenues).]{.underline} [Within Ellen Samuels's]{.underline}
monograph Fantasies of Identification: Disability, Gender, Race (2014),
she [pinpoints that "the mutual entangled and constitutive dynamic of
disability, gender, and race in modern fantasies of identification
determines the shape and trajectory of \[her\] book" and, in
articulating her main argument, states that "if, at times, one of these
embodied social identities comes to the foreground, such that parts of
the book address disability or race or gender more centrally, the
overarching argument remains structured around the inseparability of
their meanings."]{.underline}6 An incredibly useful proposition.
[Samuels's caveat guarantees that readers do not miss the way that all
discussions heavily rely on each other. Historically speaking, the
creating of disability, race, and gender occurs at the same time. The
strands of what would become [modern medicine worked to differentiate
bodies]{.mark} from each other, specifically [normal bodies from
abnormal ones]{.mark}, [where abnormal was constituted in gendered,
raced, and abled terms]{.mark}]{.underline}. These fantasies of
identification found their justification in what Samuels terms
"biocertification,"7 a process that further links the construction of
abnormality (and with it the construction of Blackness and disability)
to objective science, aspiring to some semblance of truth. What becomes
clear is not just that one cannot read race without disability nor
disability without race, but that their entanglement requires a robust
critical armature that grapples with them both. When I trace the use of
mutual constitution, [two critical reading practices emerge: first,
recuperation projects that seek to historicize, and, second, retrieval
projects that read against ableism to find agency. In this way, mutual
constitution performs as scholarly shorthand for "It's
complicated."]{.underline} Intussuscepted (that is, enfolded) in these
readings are several challenges to the practices themselves:
specifically, scholarship is stagnated between recuperation and
resistance. [What of the projects that are neither? Is there a space
between these or next to them, narratologically speaking? How can we
read the moments when race and disability have a wider range of
relationships?]{.underline} In what follows, I read the spaces where the
critical material breaks open the possibilities for new readings of
Blackness and disability in tandem[. Though much of this material
analyzes Blackness and disability broadly, I find that the distillate
reveals the critical material to itself, suggesting that madness, Black
madness in particular, troubles the impulses of retrieval and
radicality]{.underline}. First, **[[Blackness and madness encounter the
problem of existing on the same temporal plane]{.mark}, particularly
when whiteness is a factor. [The Black mad subject gets evacuated from
history]{.mark} while [the white able]{.mark} subject or white [disabled
subject dictates the terms of history's
narration]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Second, [**Black mad subjects cannot
always serve as the prompts for others' freedom from ableism.** It is
possible for Black individuals, institutions, and cultural spaces to be
ableist.]{.underline} Moreover, [when [Black spaces function as examples
of freedom]{.mark} for others, [they do not exist on their own
terms]{.mark}, a logical concern that lands us back in the terrain where
[whiteness instrumentalizes Blackness]{.mark} for its own
ends]{.underline}. Later in this conversation, [I turn to Octavia E.
Butler's Fledgling (2005) and her archive for how she theorizes
Blackness and madness.8 Butler's texts and her archive offer alternative
analytic strategies to the problems posed by mutual constitution in its
current form.]{.underline} Recuperating, [Historicizing Mutual
constitution attends to the fiction of fixity often ascribed to race and
disability writ large. Reading race and disability in this way yokes the
discourses to each other, since they typically cannot be pinned down
elsewhere.]{.underline} When Ellen Samuels traces the way this mutual
constitution functioned within the nineteenth century, she finds that
the discourses that created and sustained ideas about race and ability
were not only created at the same time but also reliant on each other
for validity. [These national fantasies were created by physicians who
scrupulously searched the body for clues about its difference.10 Both
the physically or mentally abnormal body and the racially abnormal body
were understood as close cousins, demonstrating in their difference the
validity and supremacy of the white able body by contrast.]{.underline}
Samuels writes, "At the core of the fantasy of identification lies the
assumption that embodied social identities such as race, gender, and
disability are fixed, legible, and categorizable. [This assumption, [by
now deeply naturalized in our social and ontological structures]{.mark},
in fact required elaborate construction and ongoing policing through the
nineteenth century and early twentieth."11 The very mutability of these
social categories makes necessary the fiction of their fixity and the
necessity of their policing by parties for whom that mutability causes
concern]{.underline}. Mutual constitution offers a conceptual
corrective, given the discursive history, and allows for an analysis to
take shape around that history and the cultural context of its object(s)
of inquiry. Ensuring that this corrective attends to history authorizes
critics to acknowledge the plasticity of Blackness and madness in
tandem. Consider that the United States census of 1840 was the first to
provide statistics about mental illness. [The faulty statistics counted
a higher incidence of madness among Blacks in the North at numbers that
far exceeded the amount of Black people full stop. This
[pseudoscientific evidence]{.mark} not only [arrogated madness to
Blackness]{.mark} generally but [also provided putative proof that
Blacks were unfit for freedom, claiming that free Blacks were eleven
times more likely to have mental illness]{.mark} [than the enslaved or
white populations.]{.mark}12]{.underline} The postbellum environment
does not undergo a dramatic shift in this regard; the definitions of
Blackness available hinge on definitions of sanity. Kim Nielsen's A
Disability History of the United States (2012) traces the early
conception of citizenship as tied not only to enslavement but to mental
illness as well.13 This connection and its mutability continue into the
mid-twentieth century when wider public scrutiny of mental health
institutions (and some scandal), advocacy from the family of president
John F. Kennedy, and civil rights discourse made it possible to imagine
integrating mentally ill and cognitively disabled people into public
spaces.14 [This integration effort occurs simultaneous to that which
occurred for Black people, linking the two populations in the public
sphere. This history pertains mostly to those categorized as mentally
ill or cognitively disabled.]{.underline} [Though [the definition of
madness]{.mark} for this text is more expansive than that]{.underline}
(given the healthy skepticism of psy-disciplines based on this
history[), [sketch]{.mark}ing [the relationships between the two
discourses and social identities]{.mark} over time [permits a closer
look at how Blackness and madness]{.mark} rely on each other for
concretization]{.underline}. Such an analysis also reveals how tenuous
they are**[. This history makes clear that within the United States's
cultural zeitgeist, [there is no Blackness without madness, nor madness
without Blackness]{.mark}. Yet, the discourses' fragility suggests that
[the two have been forced together out of political convenience and
presumed abjection.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Notwithstanding the utility
of mutual constitution as a historicizing tool, it cannot---as a
methodology---fully account for how race and disability interact on a
body or between bodies. **[To be mutually constituted implies a
reciprocity of creation. I put pressure on reciprocity because mutual
implies simultaneity while occupying the temporal plane]{.underline}**.
[I put pressure on creation because constitution assumes that, where
discourses or material conditions related to race and disability exist,
they develop and are sustained completely and consistently]{.underline}.
In other words, the phrase mutual constitution implies race and
disability announce themselves at the same time and both exert pressure
in constant fashion. Case in point: Michelle Jarman's work exposes this
fold. [In her hermeneutic reading of lynch mobs and eugenic discourse,
she writes that the two discourses are "not equal or competing" but
rather "dynamic social and discursive processes that inform each
other."15]{.underline} What her rhetorical sleight of hand allows is the
possibility that one discourse will occupy more space than another or
affect the material reality more than the other particularly within
interracial encounter. Jarman pinpoints the hefty pull of eugenics
discourse on the eventual castration of Benjy Compson (in Faulkner's The
Sound and the Fury). [Because the action of the novel takes place during
the early twentieth century, she links this eugenics discourse to the
pervasive nature and likely rationales for lynch mob murders. Though her
link to lynch mobs undergirds her argument by positioning the two
discourses as reliant on each other, her readings reveal that they do
not affect material reality equally]{.underline}. For instance, Jarman's
opening gambit points to a tragic illustration of when both ableist and
racist discourses collide in the real life beating of Billy Ray Johnson,
a Black cognitively disabled man, and its aftermath. Here, [[the full
force of racist eugenics comes to bear]{.mark} on the availability of
justice for Johnson. There is a slippage in the way these two discourses
occupy space: [news outlets, civil rights organizations, and law
enforcement could not conceptualize Johnson as both Black and
cognitively disabled]{.mark} (I say more about this invisibility in the
second discussion).]{.underline} He was either one or the other in their
imagination. **[[The material consequence]{.mark}--- suspended sentences
and probation for his assailants instead of jail time--- [exacerbates
the violence already inflicted]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} What
Jarman's example reveals is that race and disability do vie for
narrative space and, in this instance, determine material consequence
based on which narrative is told and which is believed. Billy Ray
Johnson's story ghosts that of Faulkner's Benjy because it undermines
how we read the interlocking ideas about Blackness and madness within
Sound and the Fury Here lies the critical lacuna we have yet to address.
[The historicization approach to discussions about race and disability
presumes a linear progression of time, an unfolding that takes place at
a pace to which we have become accustomed delineated by demarcations of
second, minute, hour, day, month, and year.]{.underline} However, as
calendars themselves often lay bare, [few cultures think of time in the
same way]{.underline}. Which New Year do you celebrate? Is your calendar
lunar or solar? Time does not progress in the same fashion for everyone.
It becomes useful to think of history in terms of the fold. Here[, I
yoke Spillers's concept of the flesh with Deleuze's understanding of the
fold (a point of connection between ideas where one begets the other) to
Fred Moten's conceptualization of being, living, writing, meaning "in
the break" (where history and narrative converge---invaginate or
intussuscept to use his terms---as a requisite part of being
intertwined).]{.underline} **[[If we are to linger]{.mark} in the fold,
[in the break]{.mark}, then [we must reckon with the way madness and
Blackness force us to render history countermnemonically: attending to
gaps, mistakes, deferrals, silences, glitches]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[It is [in this break]{.mark}, cut, fold that [the relationship between
Blackness and madness becomes most clear]{.mark}. Here is the
relationship between Blackness and disability writ large, a relationship
sutured at times by its connections, but also turned in and turned out
by missed connections, erasures, and gaps.16 Despite the fact that both
disability and race as ideas emerged at the same moments in history,
they do not necessarily occupy the same temporal plane when conjoined in
quotidian interaction.]{.underline} In thinking of interracial encounter
for instance, Sharon P. Holland reminds us of a "persistent problem in
the Black/white encounter," specifically that we must question "[what
happens when someone who exists in time meets someone who only occupies
space?"]{.underline}17 As she delineates, [[Blackness appears as the
antithesis of history]{.mark}, its excretion, [whereas whiteness stands
in for progression, being in time.]{.mark} Our sense of the two
interacting in the same moment then is skewed by the fact that Blackness
is not meant to be a part of history but rather its object. [Black
cultural production has consistently expanded upon this idea through its
skepticism of linear progressive narratives that assume Western origins,
choosing instead to position Africa]{.mark} (usually the continent,
broadly conceptualized) [as a futuristic space]{.mark} or elide Western
notions of time and space.18]{.underline} [**Thinking through [the Black
mad subject]{.mark}, we [must consider that this person is meant]{.mark}
not only [to occupy space]{.mark} but [to be consistently removed from
space in order to make room for the more recognizable subject: the white
able body]{.mark}**. It is this body that dictates the terms of history
and narrative]{.underline}. In the case of Billy Ray Johnson, the
criminal justice system determined that his assailants were allowed to
move on with their lives regardless of the violence and damage done to
his body. [If we are to consider Bell's modest proposal, the Black mad
subject is removed from time to make space for the white disabled body
as well. In other words, [the Black disabled subject exists]{.mark} only
[to shore up the value of others.]{.mark} So]{.underline},
[[when]{.mark} [the Black/white encounter is divided along
ability]{.mark} lines such that the disabled body is white and the able
body is Black, what emerges is a dynamic of [relationships]{.mark} that
[force Blackness and disability into the realm of
unspeakability]{.mark}, troubling the idea that both are created and
sustained at the same time.]{.underline}

#### The 1AC operates as an intervention against white able-bodied structures that seek to bracket out forms of black. Absent this analysis, whiteness will always seek to control the uncontrollable of mad black life.

As I mentioned, [[I deploy the term madness]{.mark} [because of the
critical possibilities it offers in its vagueness]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[It operates as a way to describe impairments such as cognitive
disability or mental illness as well as a catchall phrase designed to
reference those not behaving according to culturally prescribed
norms.]{.underline} Here, **[I harken back to the idea that [madness is
maddeningly everywhere]{.mark} with biopsychological and sociocultural
valences.]{.underline}** [[Within Black cultural contexts,
madness]{.mark} not only has this critical purchase but also [carries
with it the vernacular appeal of excess]{.mark} (e.g., mad as equivalent
to very) [and anger]{.mark}]{.underline}. For the purposes of this
discussion, [I loosely bifurcate madness into two categories, keeping in
mind that each carries with it the cultural valences of excess:
cognitive impairment (read: autism, Down syndrome, traumatic brain
injury, dementia, etc.) and mental illness (read: bipolar, depression,
schizophrenia, etc.).]{.underline} [I split these experiences in order
to attend to the differences in the way madness writ large is treated
within Black cultural contexts.3]{.underline} There are overlapping
concerns, to be sure, but **[the [reactions within Black communities
shift depending on the particular kind of madness one
demonstrates]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Lurking within each discussion of
madness--- cognitive impairment or mental illness---is the idea, simply
put, that Blackness changes things.]{.underline} **[[A Black cultural
context mandates a different set of interpretive strategies because of
the confluence of structural racism]{.mark} from the outside and [its
impact on the intracultural community,]{.mark} and [structural
patriarchy and ableism emanating from within the
community]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Parsing mental illness and cognitive
disability allows for a certain type of granularity when discussing
Black cultural contexts and madness. [The conversation that follows
relocates the discussion of Blackness and madness outside the confines
of the interracial encounter in order to under stand what may constitute
disability cultures within Blackness.]{.underline} [What analytics
become necessary when examining madness within Blackness]{.underline}?
There are of course two caveats to this discussion. First, it **[[is not
entirely possible to get outside the confines of white
cisheteropatriarchy, since it structures so much of what is possible
within Black contexts]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For that reason, I turn to
Nalo Hopkinson's work because she dares to theorize a set of Black
cultural contexts that are largely independent from white
cisheteropatriarchal structures. [Hopkinson's theorizing about
intraracial contexts relies on the particular tools of Black speculative
fiction, even though her ideas resonate outside of that creative
context.4 I also focus on cultural narratives because of what they offer
in terms of theorizing from below, especially since "through analysis,
texts on disability can be made to reveal the texture of community
life."5]{.underline} The second caveat is that there are a wide variety
of Black cultural contexts available to examine. The intention of this
discussion is not to provide a rubric that suits all of them but to
provide an inroad to examination, one that exists as a set of
overarching analytical possibilities until others develop. [As a way to
develop this schema, I read the current strategies for discussing
madness within Blackness. Again, the critical literature reveals itself
to itself through the gaps it leaves unattended]{.underline}. **[[I
propose the mad Black as a way to reimagine and
reread]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Nalo Hopkinson, as an artist-theorist,
creates mad Black characters---one with a cognitive disability and
another with a mental illness---in her mad Black novel Midnight Robber
(2000). The two narratives twin each other and open up the possibilities
for interpreting madness within Black communities. [In considering
mental illness within Black communities, two interpretive moments in the
critical literature open up the parameters to think through how madness
lays bare common culturally accepted narratives about
Blackness]{.underline}. For example, in Anna Mollow's meditation on Meri
Nana-Ama Danquah's Willow Weep for Me: A Black Woman's Journey through
Depression, A Memoir (1998), Mollow concludes that Danquah's narrative
of depression foregrounds her race, class position, and immigrant status
as a barrier to receiving adequate health care for her depression.
Contrary to most within the ex-patient/survivor/consumer movement,
[Danquah's concern is not overmedication or forced medication but a lack
thereof. [Not only do health care professionals demonstrate a lack of
competence in discussing the influence of racial discrimination on
Danquah's depression]{.mark}, but [Danquah]{.mark} also [has to combat
the]{.mark} following [ideas: that depression is not real]{.mark}, that
[she is particularly strong as a Black woman, and]{.mark} (specific to
her identity as an immigrant) that [she only need work harder to
overcome her sadness]{.mark}.]{.underline} Mollow reads Danquah's
narrative as a structural critique of the medical establishment's
tendency to ignore and/or underestimate Black women's pain. I would add
that Danquah's memoir is a cultural critique of intraracial dictums that
diminish Black women's experiences with mental illness. [What Mollow's
reading reveals is that Danquah's depression exceeds the parameters in
which she is expected to operate as a Ghanaian immigrant woman in the
United States, parameters set by both dominant cultures and her
own.]{.underline} To my mind, Danquah becomes circumscribed by her
inability to appropriately perform the scripts of Black womanhood
because of her mental illness. Here, the critical gap lies in the space
between how Danquah's depression indexes structural critique and how it
also points to sociocultural critique. Whereas Mollow's reading of
Danquah's narrative reveals how structural racism materially compounds
the assault of oppressive intracultural narratives, literary
interpretations within African American Studies unmask the limited space
available for Black characters who experience madness. [When discussing
August Wilson's oeuvre, which includes his cadre of cognitively disabled
characters, Harry [Elam describes "racialized madness" as a "trope that
became operative in clinical practice, literary creation, and cultural
theory]{.mark} in the modern period as artists, critics, and
practitioners in all these arenas identified social and cultural roots
for Black psychological impairment."]{.underline}6 Elam usefully locates
this trope in Frantz Fanon's and W. E. B. Du Bois's work as a diagnosis
of what ails African descended people. The solution with August Wilson's
(and others') work is to upend the social, cultural, and discursive
elements that comprise a world hostile to Blackness. [Elam argues that
August [Wilson creates characters that experience madness to clarify how
much social and spiritual change would be necessary for a group of
people who have already been driven mad by a mad world. This is a
sociogenic madness, madness without pathos]{.mark}.7]{.underline} I
reference Elam and his work in African American literary study because
of the way sociogenic theories have particular critical purchase for
this field. **[[They denounce the pathologization of Black people for
being Black yet embrace the understanding of the world as
anti-Black]{.mark}. Yet, [this is also madness without the
multidimensionality that accompanies embodiment or aesthetic
intervention: madness in service of sanity.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Mollow, Elam, and others abide by one delimited script: madness is not a
biological or psychosocial impairment with experiences all its own.
Rather, those who are Black and mad are societal bellwethers. Their
madness either presages or pinpoints putative larger issues at stake.
[[This]{.mark} idea [rests on the politicization of both Blackness and
madness]{.mark}, where either or both are primarily or solely political
identities. [Black madness then becomes revelatory for the rest of the
world and the Black mad folks]{.mark}---real or imagined---[stand in for
an examination of what is happening]{.mark}]{.underline}. Their
existence functions as an analysis tout court, an explication de texte
that the world operates according to antiBlack logics. This script is of
course not new. [We have consistently thought of people who occupy
marginalized social positions as markers of whether our governments,
cultures, and communities fulfill ethical or moral obligations of
caretaking. However, we cannot completely shunt aside the way the idea
of a societal bellwether objectifies and distances the Black mad,
stripping them of the multidimensionality that would emerge within a
communal context. Critics attend to this conceptual problem by
considering these characters or people within intraracial communities,
but often these communities embrace this script as well. From this
critical impulse follows the erroneous idea that the Black mad do not
have community, or they operate as lone soldiers]{.underline}. **[Here,
[their existential or ontological homelessness becomes a vehicle for
other]{.mark} (sometimes, non-Black or non-mad) [characters or people to
discover their own missing humanity. Or, said homelessness results in
death]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Read in the fold, in the
break]{.underline}. **[[The Black mad]{.mark} as societal bellwether
[moves]{.mark} according [to a linear progression of time, where their
existence must be incorporated or excised in order to demonstrate
progress of some sort.]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Billy Ray Johnson echoes
here.) Typically, **[that [results in an erasure of either their
Blackness or their madness]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [Removing
the impulse to view the Black mad as living analyses, they become
invaginated into the moments of a text and do not function in the
service of others but rather have their own plotlines and, sometimes,
create their own resolutions. Or don't. Narrative time no longer stands
still, but it also does not operate strictly in linear fashion,
preferring to intussuscept itself or create gaps and
pauses.]{.underline}

#### The role of the judge is to be an immediator not a mediator, mediation is undergirded by logistical whiteness that seeks out the destruction of the excessive share. Immediation is not a neutral process, rather a subjective force of thirdness that interjects between the two in the name of liberation from the logistical path of existence.

We already know how the story ends. On May 29, 2021, the headline reads:
"Canada mourns as remains of 215 children found at indigenous school."8
It wasn't an indigenous school, of course. It was a residential school,
a Canadian school, in the clearing. The picture says it all: sparse
trees growing in the background, empty yard, an architecture completely
at odds with the environment, cleared of life, of all that immanently
interconnects. [The violence of logistics is inscribed in the ghost
trees of its whitened surround. How we organize bodies, we who sidle

all about the cotton planted in their wake.]{.underline} The ghostly
outline of Proulx's pine table haunts the residential school, its
absence equal to the absence of education. Because what the residential
school really does is unteach. Taking the place of pedagogy, what is
practiced here is theft. Theft of thought, of imagination. This theft is
a rape. A physical rape, a sexual aggression, but also a conceptual
rape, a clearing---"to snatch, to grab, to carry off by force"---of all
that lives in the abyss of what has been left behind.9 Rape, relation
severed, cuts the fragile interwoven threads of existence, wresting life
from life-living, from the more-than that gives it its spirited and
spiritual contour. If body is land, if bodying is only ever worlding,
what residential school does, in this most recent form of clearing, is
sever this imbrication, leaving the body lifeless. [All that remains is
the clearing. And a mess. But this can be handled. [This is how
mediation does its work, in the name of and as
logistics]{.mark}.]{.underline} [From here on in, things will be
managed. [Managers will be appointed to organize, to administer, the
now-reduced environment]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark} science of
loss---"which is to say the science of whiteness, or logistics"---[is
predicated on]{.mark} the end of sharing, on [the destruction of the
excessive share]{.mark}, the annihilation of that which exceeds the
one-two form whose dramaturgy relies of the intervention of the
mediator.]{.underline}10 [The mediator will take the form of the "yellow
eyebrows" in Proulx's account, but it also need not take a simple human
form]{.underline}. [Repetition of the same is the form it takes in a
dramaturgy of extinction]{.underline}. Scene 3 Clearing produces
property. Property produces dispossession. "All property is loss because
all property is the loss of sharing."11 [The accursed share of all that
exceeds interpersonality, mediation, whiteness, logistics, all that
cannot be accounted for, sickens the]{.underline} field. And sometimes
rejuvenates it. The force of the transindividual, of all that exceeds
and precedes the individual, does rewild. But its vitality is weakened,
and as perception is honed to single out the individual over the field,
the human increasingly becomes the focal point, becoming synonymous with
life. This is how the logistics of genocide---the genocide of
relation---does its work. [[The genocide of relation can never be traced
back]{.mark}, quite. Relation cannot be propertied. What is lost cannot
be parsed]{.underline}. The yellow eyebrows have a role to play, of
course, and we could call on the archbishop for that missing apology,
but the truth is, it was never just one. He was never just the one. [He
is a logistical pattern, a commitment to the dramaturgy of (white) man
as self-centered orchestrator of existence cleared. Logistics: the slave
ship, but also the body-as-individual. "The first odious vessel produced
by and for logistics is not the slave ship, but the body---flesh
conceptualized---which bears the
individual-in-subjection]{.underline}."12 [In the clearing, man is
revealed as the loss of relation]{.underline}. Humanism is born here, in
the empty space of the stolen land, in the vast expanse of the 1+1, the
infinite regress of nothing-in-between. [[How to fill the
emptiness?]{.mark} How to create an account for all that is lost and yet
claimed? [Mediation offers to fill the shape of the
between]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Mediation as the figure of what comes
between, of what fills that "empty" space]{.underline}. [The
adjuster]{.underline}, the divorce lawyer, the priest, the government
agent. [[A quick intervention]{.mark} to make sense of all that has
become unclear, [to fill in the lines]{.mark}, to provide
context]{.underline}. And perhaps this does make things clearer, perhaps
we understand each other a bit better now that we've mediated all we
couldn't make sense of in the vast emptiness of our difference. But the
problem is: [[mediation never goes away]{.underline}.]{.mark} [It sits
there, inert but active, facilitating the ongoing impoverishment
relation by adhering to all that takes the shape of the 1+1 of
body-as-individual, of interpersonality]{.underline}. Because in advance
of the gesture of inserting the mediating influence, he is already
there. [Long before the divorce, [he]{.mark} [hovers]{.mark}, betweener,
[judging]{.mark}, parsing, condoning, [condemning]{.mark}. His take
doesn't really matter. What matters is that [he remains in the offing,
holding things apart.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Mediation is the father of
the control society]{.mark}. It is the way [surveillance takes on a
personality from the outside]{.mark} in]{.underline}. Whether formally
or informally, [mediation sets the tone for an interpersonality that, by
definition, can only be lived at a distance]{.underline}. Playing at
impartiality, [[mediation haunts the surround]{.mark}, [reducing it to
what is already known]{.mark}, what is already valued, what is already
within the scope of the expressible]{.underline}. 2+1, always less than
3, mediation is passive aggressor, [poised for judgment]{.underline},
always in the know (while it listens carefully). [Because [its role is
to keep existence in its track, on its logistical path]{.mark}. [It
doesn't really matter who is right. It matters that it needs
mediation]{.mark}. Mediation knows best, trampling on any detail of
middling, sewing interactivity into a twoness without
excess]{.underline}. Hardening the between of interpersonality into the
amplification of the self-same, mediation lodges at the interstice,
cutting it into a hyphen, setting up its colony on the bridge. [Settler,
it speaks from a place it has never had to truly encounter because its
role is only to order things apart. Harney and Moten might speak of
mediation with the same disdain as they do of logistics, which they call
the "science of whiteness]{.underline}."13 Mediation is the logistic
category par excellence of whiteness. [It has no content, is not in
itself an agent of transformation, does nothing but cannibalize the life
it parses. Its intervention happens in the beat of enter and retreat,
leaving the uneasy twoness of existence to sort itself out.]{.underline}
In the name of property and propriety, mediation solves all
uncertainties of zoning. That it never actually leaves is its dirty
secret. [But [the logistics of mediation can only
fail]{.mark}.]{.underline} The interface is shaky---we know this both
from the endemic code 404, page not found, and from the impossibility of
truly domesticating our surrounds. [Ultimately, [the]{.mark} squirrels,
the black flies, the birds, the worms, the fungi, the weeds, the
viruses, the [hackers]{.mark} [cannot be kept in their
place]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The disarray is handled, of course, with
more mediation, with more logistics]{.underline}. The interface claims a
distance, a secure between-two that repeats the refrain of nature
colonized, of culture denatured. [It promises a security of
inhabitation, a zone that can be controlled, a slip through which we can
safely enter, we who claim the place. Here, in the logistics of passage
that beats at the cadence of the one-two, me-you, [the outcome is always
the same. Police to subjugate]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Code to
organize]{.underline}. Clear to colonize. [Logistics aims to straighten
us out, untangle us, and open us to its usufruct, its improving use;
such access to us, in its turn, improves the flow line, the straight
line]{.underline}. And what logistics takes to be the shortest distance
between us requires emplotting us as bodies in space where interiority
can be imposed even as the capacity for interiority can be denied, in
the constant measure and regulation of flesh and earth.Scene 5 Deleuze
and Guattari speak of man as the white wall of the black hole of
existence.15 Think landscape painting, especially the kind that excises
that very life that breathed it into existence. If you're not familiar,
search for "Canadian art." And if you don't know the history of the
mansplaining of the Canadian landscape, search for the Group of Seven,
the early twentieth-century Canadian landscape painters, and notice not
only the ubiquity of the vast open, uninhabited space, notice the
clearing. Very little has changed over the last hundred years. We still
see Canada through the clear, in the emptiness of nature cultured. The
denuded land, the empty north, is how we art ourselves still today, we
who property the land. The Group of Seven, those painters of the land
pristine, of the great white north, the painters of the land of the
(single) pine and of the distant ridges, they are still with us, still
managing the imagination, orchestrating the field, playing the
dramaturgy of extinction. Logistics are also aesthetic (if not artful).
The white man is a specter. That is to say, the white man is without
content, without shape. He is the shift in form that allows all
takings-place to be propertied inhabitations, which is to say, sites
already claimed. This is whiteness: the pretense that the lines that
demarcate the boundary between me and you protect you, protect me, from
the wilderness of all that cannot be contained (and must be kept at
bay). The truth is, the wilderness was cleared, but never quite
colonized. And that is why whiteness is alive and well. To police a job
half-done. Scene 6 [[Mediation]{.mark} makes many promises. It promises
clarity: think, drop-down menu. It [promises]{.mark}
[fairness]{.mark}]{.underline}: think, divorce court. It promises
health: think, therapy. The gesture is cast as innocuous. [A simple
third, a neutral agent. A little bit of reason. A moment of
distance.]{.underline} An interlude so that things can be tied up again
and smooth functioning can resume. A representation of the useful.16 But
what is it to insert distance into a field of relation if not violence
of the highest degree? Whose distance? At what cost? To what ends?
Guattari fights against this at every turn, refusing mediation either in
politics or in psychiatry. Schizoanalysis is the proposition, a call for
a transversal operation that breaks the pretense of neutrality in the
encounter. A [therapeutics of transversality. No more triangle. No more
transference.]{.underline} Schizoanalysis is the event of the encounter
itself, the practice of encountering. To be in the relation is to have
been changed by it. What this looked like: a years-long institutional
arrangement housed at a clinic called La Borde in the north of France
whereby to be in the therapeutic encounter was to live with the effects
of encounters in the everyday and to learn from them how to continue to
live. Nothing very complicated, really. But infinitely complex in its
transversality. [Because to live in the encounter, to allow ourselves to
be changed by it, is to be continuously undone, and to be sensitive to
all that comes alive in that undoing]{.underline}. Who we are is a
question that can only really be asked (and answered) by the mediator.
[[The mediator]{.mark}, after all, [looks in from outside to tell us how
our actions are affecting the world]{.mark}]{.underline}. Without the
mediator there is no steady external gaze, no calm interface for the
mirroring. [That's why "who we are" is always a white question, a
question of whiteness, of colonization.]{.underline} Blackness, write
Harney and Moten, is not a thing, or a state (of being). It is the way
the doing expresses. It is not a subject, not a person, not a property.
It is a field. It is the excess on itself of a body claimed, blackened
by hate. Blackness is the celebration of refusing to claim, to be
claimed. "Meanwhile, Michael Brown is like another fall and rise through
man---come and gone, as irruption and rupture, to remind us not that
black lives matter but that black life matters; that the absolute and
undeniable blackness of life matters; that this is not a judgment of
value but a description of a field of activity that obliterates the
worldly distinction between the organic and the inorganic."17 Blackness
is not the simple descriptor of what has been enfleshed. [Blackness
cannot be mediated into a form imposed (exposed). Blackness is the force
of living that exceeds colonization, its accursed share]{.underline}.
And in that sense, the wildness of the surround, it too is black. As is
the earth. This is what Guattari means when he entreats us to move from
schizoanalysis as a therapeutic-political dispositif, an agencement more
than an apparatus, a moving-forth of encounterings afield, toward the
transversality of what he calls the "three ecologies."18 These three
ecologies, the mental/conceptual, the environmental, and the social, are
the overlap, as I see it, of a commitment to a blackening of the earth,
out of the clear. (Necessarily European) man, in and as the exception,
imposes speciation upon himself, in an operation that extracts and
excepts himself from the earth in order to confirm his supposed dominion
over it. And just as the earth must be forcefully speciated to be
possessed, man must forcefully speciate himself in order to enact this
kind of possession. This is to say that racialization is present in the
very idea of dominion over the earth; in the very idea and enactment of
the exception; in the very nuts and bolts of possession-by-improvement.
The world is posed as the way to live on the earth as the individual is
posed as the way to live in the world. To live in the world as an
individual is therefore to be logistic, and to be logistic is to settle
into a rhythm that kills, to beat out that rhythm over the undercommon
track that keeps (giving away) its own measure.19 Scene 7 Guattari wrote
The Three Ecologies in what have come to be known as his winter years.
The winter years came after a sustained attempt at working with the
Green Party in the aftermath of the terrible letdown of post-1968
politics in France. [This attempt to connect to state politics left
Guattari with a sour taste. He knew better, of course, than to trust
state politics to be a site of transformation.]{.underline}
Schizoanalysis had been the wager that there were other ways---that to
work "in common," "toward the common" is, ultimately, always to commit
to the logic of mediation. In The Three Ecologies, [he makes a plea to
[invent new ways of being committed to and involved in the urgent call
to transversalize experience]{.mark}, ways that move beyond how the
state lays claim to existence: In the domain of social ecology there
will be times of struggle in which everyone will feel impelled to decide
on common objectives and to act "like little soldiers," by which I mean
like good activists]{.underline}. [But there will simultaneously be
periods of resingularisation in which individual and collective
subjectivities will take their marbles and go home without a thought for
collective goals, and in which creative expression as such will take
precedence]{.underline}. This new ecosophical logic---and I want to
emphasize this point---resembles the manner in which an artist may be
led to alter his work after the intrusion of some accidental detail, an
event-incident that suddenly makes his initial project bifurcate, making
it drift \[dériver\] far from its previous path, however certain it had
once appeared to be.20 There is an echo in this ecosophic call to Moten
and Harney[: Rather than dissipate our preoccupation with how we live
and breathe, we need to defend our ways in our persistent practice of
them. [It's not about taking the streets; it's about how, and about
what, we take to the streets]{.mark}]{.underline}. What would it be and
what would it mean for us jurisgeneratively to take to the streets, to
live in the streets, to gather together another city right here, right
now?21 Ecosophic logic is a refusal of the clearing, of the ways in
which we seek to inhabit the space already colonized. It recognizes the
lure, and understands the commitment to change that the gesture of
taking the streets embodies. But ecosophic logic asks a different
question: [What if instead we practiced living by creating new
conditions that didn't center us, that didn't inadvertently redeem that
central and self-centering figure of man and its [mediating
logistics]{.mark}? What if we painted into the dérive of artfulness's
angle on experience? What if we moved at the pace of that accidental
detail tangled with the weeds we have been wasting so much time
clearing?]{.underline} [Ecosophic logic is an urgent call to refuse the
ongoing clearing that denies, decries, and [violates the force of
blackness in the ongoing genocide of all that resists]{.mark} the
count]{.underline}. To refuse does not mean to face and challenge.
Frontality, the neurotypical activity par excellence, only cements into
place what is already there, what is already claiming the ground of
existence. To refuse means to move into the accursed share of
life-living twisting in the troubled interstice, to move with that
anarchic share of existence that keeps giving life. For life-living to
thrive, life has to be activated at those interstices that exceed man.
Life's expression as tangle has to be attuned to from the edges in.
Conditions have to be crafted to honor what is not about us. This is
what the First Nations in Barkskins of course already knew. And for this
they were cleared. To see, to feel, what was always already there, to
pulse with a force of life-living that cannot be claimed---owed or
owned---this was always the crime. Scene 8 The many years Guattari spent
practicing schizoanalysis, which is to say, living at La Borde and
encountering, daily, the shape of an existence unmediated, an existence
committed, always, to a refusal of normopathy---these are what he takes
into the project of the three ecologies. And it is specifically the
orientation of La Borde toward neurodiversity, I believe, that makes it
necessary to underscore what he calls the mental, or conceptual, ecology
as the inflecting force that must, and will, change the contours of the
environmental and the social. La Borde taught him this: to skirt the
question of the subject leaves the black hole wide open, filled to the
brim with neurotypicality, whiteness. [In the sickness that has befallen
the earth---the ongoing genocide of all that eludes the
count---[subjectivity, too, has fallen ill]{.mark}. Replaced by the face
of man, given the guise of whiteness in all its logistical powers of
mediation, subjectivity has been swallowed, engulfed by the
subject]{.underline}. ["The main feature of the colonial-capitalistic
unconscious is the reduction of subjectivity to its subject's
experience."]{.underline}22 But subjectivity, as Guattari understands
it, is nothing other than its ongoing production. It is not the subject.
It is the transversal, the emergent unmediated middle, the collectivity
that must never be reduced to the one. This is why, for a renewed
project of the earth, or as Moten and Harney would have it, for the
blackening of the earth---"we are the moving, blackened, blackening
earth"23---"it [will be a question of literally reconstructing the
modalities of 'group-being' \[l'être-en-groupe\], not only through
'communicational' interventions but through existential mutations driven
by the motor of subjectivity]{.underline}."24 To construct modalities
for group-being is a call for an aesthetics of sociality which exceeds
the 1+1 of interpersonality. Group-being, or what Guattari refers to as
the "group subject," is not countable. The group subject is never the
sum of its parts. As solitary as it is multiplicitous, the group subject
makes felt how subjectivity is produced in the excess on itself of
coming into relation. The group subject is how the more-than of the
relational field finds expression. It is the emergent collectivity of an
expression of life-living shared (in its accursed excess), expression
irreducible to the one, always beyond consensus. Without mediation, the
group subject is activated in the renunciation of summing up. To produce
the modalities for this excess of existence requires a mutation on
existence itself, a mutation that in every sense rethinks subjectivity
as a position. The group subject reminds us that what we produce is
never solely ours. We are not simply our-selves. We are fieldings of
complex imbrication. [Any other account of experience is subjected to
mediation, organized by logistics.]{.underline} Anarchival to the core,
the production of subjectivity is not an account of a life contained. It
is not condensable to something like identity. It is not reducible to
the form of the human. It is always more-than, always in movement, a
motor or conduit of a worlding. The production of subjectivity bodies in
the same gesture that it refuses to be a body, an
"individual-in-subjection."25 That is to say: in the production of
subjectivity the bodying is always a being of relation. Always in
movement, it does its living in the unlimited exposure that exceeds any
body-world separation. Subjectivity is not inside. It is not in me. It
is out of me. [Rather than speak of the "subject[," we should perhaps
speak of components of subjectification]{.mark}, each working more or
less on its own. This would lead us, necessarily, [to re-examine the
relation between concepts of the individual and subjectivity]{.mark},
and, above all, to make a clear distinction between the
two]{.underline}. Vectors of subjectification do not necessarily pass
through the individual, which in reality appears to be something like a
"terminal" for processes that involve human groups, socio-economic
ensembles, data-processing machines, etc. Therefore, interiority
establishes itself at the crossroads of multiple components, each
relatively autonomous in relation to the other, and, if need be, in open
conflict.26 "That abolition starts with the self."27 In the drift,
subjectivity's dérive is irreducible to the human. Active in the
interval of worlds making themselves, subjectivity is never reducible to
a subject. The production of subjectivity is the activity of the
interstice: vector, not form. Schizoanalysis works at this uneasy
juncture. The task of schizoanalysis is not to get between body and
world, between-two. Its task is to make way for all that already
populates the between, and to agitate, from within the field of
relation, orientations already in germ. Fostering the germination,
tending the field, schizoanalysis vectors the inflection. The vectoring
requires a subtraction from the open field of all that is still in
potentia. Schizoanalysis culls from potential a shape, a way. This
excision from process is a subtraction from infinitude to the finite.
From the side of infinitude, in the field of immanence, Whitehead calls
this activity that sparks a standing out of experience "importance."
From the side of finitude, in the field of activity, Whitehead calls it
"expression": Expression is founded on the finite occasion. It is the
activity of finitude impressing itself on its environment. Thus it has
its origin in the finite; and it represents the immanence of the finite
in the multitude of its fellows beyond itself. The two together, namely
importance and expression, are witnesses both to the monistic aspect of
the universe and to its pluralistic character. Importance passes from
the world as one to the world as many; whereas, expression is the gift
from the world as many to the world as one.28 Importance and expression
function as intensifiers of experience, bringing into activity the
singularity of a life that nonetheless continues to carry its anarchic
share. [In this account, the human is not singled out. There is no
externalizing voice, no mediator. Arrows of experience are their own
force, importance not a question of what matters to me, but of what
actually]{.underline} (but always also in potentia) makes a difference.
Importance makes way for precision in experience. [That is to say,
importance is what fosters a certain specific angle of existence,
allowing certain qualities of experience to take precedence over others.
We have come to believe that mediation is necessary to parse
experience.]{.underline} But as Whitehead emphasizes, the world is
always in its own pursuit of amplification. Incessant clearing,
colonialism without end, in the afterlife of slavery, results in systems
out of kilter. Ecological destruction has finally begun to register,
centuries too late. The question of how to bring things into a
metastability that is conducive to life-living must involve a reckoning
with the deadening force of mediation. We don't need another apology. We
need to get out of the way. The blackening of the earth requires the
production of something entirely other than me, or you.The infraface29
of the three ecologies---"the world as one to the world as many ... the
world as many to the world as one"---is immediating.30 [[Immediation is
not the opposite of mediation]{.mark}. Rather, [it is the force of a
thirdness irreducible to a between-two]{.mark}. Immediation is the
more-than, the n+1 that is by necessity n-1, one as many, many as one,
[the qualitative force of an uncountability that diagonalizes to give
rise to what else moves in the relation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The
production of subjectivity is immediating]{.mark} to the degree that it
is not produced by something outside itself. [Immediating]{.mark},
always at once body and world, [its own perspective]{.mark}. That is to
say, its angle on existence is not ours, cannot be reduced to us. The
production of subjectivity is a making-conceptual of
existence]{.underline}. It is an attuning to the deadly violence of the
body-world split produced in the wake of the clearing.31 There are not
three ecologies. There is one ecology multiply intertwined. [To get to
the potential of what the three ecologies in their transversality offer,
the production of subjectivity must be attended]{.underline}
[to]{.underline}. [We have failed each other at the juncture of the
production of subjectivity in particular, and nothing will be possible
without that shift]{.underline}. In the words of The Invisible
Committee, the exhaustion of natural resources is probably much less
advanced than the exhaustion of subjective resources, of vital
resources, that is afflicting our contemporaries. If so much
satisfaction is derived from surveying the devastation of the
environment it's largely because this veils the frightening ruin of
subjectivities. Every oil spill, every sterile plain, every species
extinction is an image of our souls in rags, a reflection of our lack of
world, of our intimate impotence to inhabit it.32 To become in excess of
a person, to activate the conditions for a life-living that worlds in
the bodying, is a social and environmental act. [The emergent sociality
of becoming-environmental never happens through the clearing. In happens
in the midst, black flies and all. [The production of
subjectivity]{.mark} in the transversality of the three ecologies is the
way the more-than of nature naturing [crafts a sociality
ecosophicall]{.mark}]{.underline}[y.]{.mark} A sociality, as Harney and
Moten might say, all incomplete. Guattari calls the ecology he
associates with the production of subjectivity "mental." I prefer
conceptual, to produce a stronger sense of how the world itself is alive
with the movement of thought. A turn to Whitehead brings the two
together. For Whitehead, the conceptual share is that excess of
experience that tunes the occasion to its potential. All activity in the
world has a conceptual share, but it is true to say that some aspects of
existence make use of it more emphatically. Whitehead calls this
"mentality." Mentality, as in Guattari, is not reducible to the mind.
Mentality is the force of existence. It is the world's capacity to
exceed itself. All incomplete, the world continuously renews itself.
Scene 10 We don't need to look to some far off lands: it's already here.
Isn't that what Tommy Orange means when he says, "Being Indian has never
been about returning to the land. The land is everywhere or nowhere"?33
The work has already begun. [[The accursed share of life-living]{.mark}
is too unwieldy, too uncountable, to be mediated. It [cannot be
governed]{.mark}. This is its potency, but also its
fallacy.]{.underline} The work is not where we've been taught it is. And
the tools we need are not the ones we own. a nascent subjectivity a
constantly mutating socius an environment in the process of being
reinvented34 The three ecologies are a proposition. They are not a
place. To follow the artist-architects Arakawa and Madeline Gins, we
might call them an architectural procedure.35 An architectural procedure
is not an architecture. [It is a fielding of potential that brings into
constellation enabling constraints for the construction of a
world.]{.underline} Procedurality is key. An architectural procedure
must produce itself propositionally. This means that what emerges will
never be a thing, a site. It will undercommon itself into existence,
perhaps---as Arakawa and Gins once said---"only making an appearance
indirectly."36 [Because to see-feel it is to have created the conditions
for feeling, conditions that were never reducible to a subject as given
in advance]{.underline}. The event of the three ecologies is here, in
the productive looping of a field of experience that is at once
constitutive of its expression and constituted by it. Because when
importance and expression meet, it is never at our bidding.

**Butler, 79** \[Octavia Estelle Butler was an American science fiction
author. A multiple recipient of both the Hugo and Nebula awards, she
became in 1995 the first science-fiction writer to receive a MacArthur
Fellowship. Born in Pasadena, California, Butler was raised by her
widowed mother, "Positive Obsession"/ -ekh-\]

**[Shyness is]{.underline}** shit.

It [isn't cute or feminine or appealing. It's **torment**, and it's
**shit**.]{.underline}

I spent a lot of my childhood and adolescence staring at the ground.
It's a wonder I didn't become a geologist. I whispered. People were
always saying, "Speak up! We can't hear you."

[I memorized required reports and poems for school, then cried my way
out of having to recite]{.underline}. Some teachers condemned me for not
studying. Some forgave me for not being very bright. Only a few saw my
shyness.

["**She's so backward**," some of my relatives said.]{.underline}

"[**She's so nice and quiet**,"]{.underline} tactful friends of my
mother said. **[I believed I was ugly and stupid, clumsy, and socially
hopeless]{.underline}**. I also thought that everyone would notice these
faults if I drew attention to myself[. I wanted to disappear. Instead, I
grew to be six feet tall. Boys in particular seemed to assume that I had
done this growing deliberately and that I should be ridiculed for it as
often as possible]{.underline}

I hid out in a big pink notebook---one that would hold a whole ream of
paper. I made myself a universe in it. [There I could be a magic horse,
a Martian, a telepath. . . . There I could be anywhere but here, any
time but now, with any people but these.]{.underline}

My mother did day work. She had a habit of bringing home any books her
employers threw out. She had been permitted only three years of school.
Then she had been put to work. Oldest daughter. She believed
passionately in books and education. She wanted me to have what she had
been denied. She wasn't sure which books I might be able to use, so she
brought whatever she found in the trash. [I had books yellow with age,
books without covers, books written in, crayoned in, spilled on, cut,
torn, even partly burned. I stacked them in wooden crates and
second-hand bookcases and read them when I was ready for
them.]{.underline} Some were years too advanced for me when I got them,
but I grew into them.

[An **obsession**]{.underline}, according to my old Random House
dictionary[, is "**the domination of one's thoughts or feelings by a
persistent idea, image, desire, etc."** Obsession can be a useful tool
if it's positive obsession.]{.underline} Using it is like aiming
carefully in archery.

I took archery in high school because it wasn't a team sport. I liked
some of the team sports, but in archery you did well or badly according
to your own efforts. No one else to blame. I wanted to see what I could
do. I learned to aim high. Aim above the target. Aim just there! Relax.
Let go. If you aimed right, you hit the bull's-eye. I saw positive
obsession as a way of aiming yourself, your life, at your chosen target.
Decide what you want. Aim high. Go for it.

[I wanted to sell a story. Before I knew how to type, **I wanted to sell
a story.**]{.underline}

I pecked my stories out two fingered on the Remington portable
typewriter my mother had bought me. I had begged for it when I was ten,
and she had bought it

"[You'll spoil that child]{.underline}!" one of her friends told her.
"[What does she need with a typewriter at her age? It will soon be
sitting in the closet with dust on it. All that money
wasted!"]{.underline}

[It will soon be sitting in the closet with dust on it. **All that money
wasted!"**]{.underline} I asked my science teacher, Mr. Pfaff, to type
one of my stories for me---[type it the way it was supposed to be with
no holes erased into the paper and no strike-overs.]{.underline} He did.
He even corrected my terrible spelling and punctuation. To this day I'm
amazed and grateful.

I had no idea how to submit a story for publication. I blundered through
unhelpful library books on writing. Then I found a discarded copy of The
Writer, a magazine I had never heard of. That copy sent me back to the
library to look for more, and for other writers' magazines to see what I
could learn from them. In very little time I'd found out how to submit a
story, and my story was in the mail. A few weeks later I got my first
rejection slip.

When I was older, I decided [that **getting a rejection slip was like
being told your child was ugly**. You got mad and didn't believe a word
of it. Besides, **look at all the really ugly literary children** out
there in the world being published and **doing fine!**]{.underline}

I spent my teens and much of my twenties collecting printed rejections.
Early on, my mother lost \$61.20---a reading fee charged by a so-called
agent to look at one of my unpublishable stories. No one had told us
that agents weren't supposed to get any money up front, weren't supposed
to be paid until they sold your work. Then they were to take ten percent
of whatever the work earned. Ignorance is expensive. That \$61.20 was
more money back then than my mother paid for a month's rent.

I badgered friends and acquaintances into reading my work, and they
seemed to like it. Teachers read it and said kindly, unhelpful things.
But there were no creative writing classes at my high school, and no
useful criticism. At college (in California at that time, junior college
was almost free), I took classes taught by an elderly woman who wrote
children's stories. [She was polite about the science fiction and
fantasy that I kept handing in, but she finally asked in exasperation,
"**Can't you write anything normal**?"]{.underline}

A schoolwide contest was held. All submissions had to be made
anonymously. My short story won first prize. I was an eighteen-year-old
freshman, and I won in spite of competition from older, more experienced
people. Beautiful. The \$15.00 prize was the first money my writing
earned me.

After college I did office work for a while, then factory and warehouse
work. My size and strength were advantages in factories and warehouses.
And no one expected me to smile and pretend I was having a good time.

I got up at two or three in the morning and wrote. [Then I went to work.
I hated it, and I have no gift for suffering in silence. I muttered and
complained and quit jobs and found new ones and collected more rejection
slips. **One day in disgust I threw them all away. Why keep such
useless, painful things?**]{.underline}

#### Emerging technologies create [disinformation]{.underline} campaigns, expanding state influence to justify its [mistreatment]{.underline} of racialized and disabled subjects through the weaponization of cognitive dissonance in [algorithmic fashion]{.underline}

Zach **Naqvi 21** \[Department of Political Science, University of
Alberta, Madness, Migration and Media in the Modern Digital Age, April

Citizenship, migration and international relations informing how we
conceptualize policy get inextricably tied to sovereign states that
determine the fate of refugees. The framework that facilitates this
process has followed a chaotic trajectory in recent years. Understanding
the rise of populist rhetoric emerging in North America and Europe,
among others, points to recent developments in international relations
requiring greater scrutiny, with specific practices necessitating a
closer look by communities at home and abroad. I argue that [**we have
fallen short of our collective humanitarian promise** of dignity and
fundamental human rights for everyone, regardless of race, gender,
religion, class, or country of origin]{.underline}. Unsurprisingly, the
sovereignty of the state and a universal humanitarian aim have had
difficulties getting reconciled. In theory and practice, pragmatism and
utopia and things related to realist necessity versus a more utopian
idealism -- international relations are plagued with a disconnect
between what ought to be and what is. The reason is that
[**[states]{.mark}**, unlike individuals, families and communities **are
not concerned** primarily **with** such lofty ideals as **human
dignity**, fraternity, **equality**, and the like. Instead, **they
[get]{.mark}** inseparably **[linked with the]{.mark}** fundamental
**[objective of consolidating, maintaining, and executing
powers]{.mark}** that **[we]{.mark}**]{.underline} as individuals [upon
the grounds of elections, citizenship and birth or connection have
**[authorized the state to have]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Furthermore,
many view frameworks of citizenship and migration from a privileged
standpoint, concerned with realist undertones of security, sovereignty,
and the success of their state above all else. The dire question here is
whether those immigrating, seeking asylum or even completely stateless
can reasonably expect to be accommodated by sovereign states.

First, [alternative facts or the designation by some that we are
entering a post-truth world, amplified by improvements in technology
moving us collectively towards increasingly interconnected
existence]{.underline}, lay bare for all to see a new power dynamic
playing out over the past decade. [The aim of alternative facts is "to
establish power: **[they are lying to flaunt
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They are saying to us: 'we know that you
know that this is a lie, and we don't care, because there is absolutely
nothing you can do about it' ... over years, [**[ceaseless propaganda
and spectacle]{.mark}**, exacerbated by **corrections and retractions,
[can destroy your sense of reality]{.mark}.** Time spirals forward and
lurches backwards]{.underline}." (Kendzior, 2020, p.18) Take Franz
Fanon, for example. Despite his death decades ago, his lived experience
then provides critical insight now. [Fanon was a doctor]{.underline} and
the acclaimed author of Black Skin, White Masks. [Despite his subjective
personhood being complex and multifaceted, not constrained simply to
role or race, when practicing medicine, it is a mistake made as a black
doctor if he made a mistake.]{.underline} Similarly, [[**refugees,
migrants, and asylum seekers** are]{.underline}]{.mark} broadly
[**[categorized as if the totality of their being constitutes
race]{.mark}** -- and nothing more.]{.underline} Other times, we simply
view things based on monetary or pragmatic conditionality. As Fanon
notes, it is society, unlike biochemical processes, that do not escape
human influence. Yet[, **it is us that brings society into
being**]{.underline}. (Fanon, 2008, p. XV) We saw this media makeover
take place in society with the portrayal of Muslims, migrants and more
recently with the Chinese during COVID-19, among a myriad of other
examples through the ages. Kendzior notes how, "a media makeover is a
peculiar wound. It is a terrible feeling to be in pain and ignored -- as
a place, as a person. It is worse to be given a mask and told it's your
face." (Kendzior, 2020, p. 22) In other words, alongside ordinary people
behaving rationally according to human psychology, some behave
pathologically according to inhuman psychology. (Fanon, 2008, p. 15) [We
have forgotten sense from nonsense and implemented it ubiquitously as if
it held any semblance of truth]{.underline}.

Take Wiener's (1960) [**[framing]{.mark}** of the coming difficulties of
**[technological advancement]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It]{.underline}
still proves influential because he
**[[generalized]{.underline}]{.mark}** it **[beyond [literal
human--machine cooperation to any]{.mark} [situation in which two
systems work together]{.mark} at different temporal and perceptual
scales]{.underline}**. Because [choices]{.underline} [made]{.underline}
today [with limited information can have terrible long-term
consequences]{.underline} that we cannot foresee, Wiener warns that
"[the purpose put into the machine]{.underline} --- [be it a literal
machine]{.underline} like a Twitter algorithm, [or a metaphorical one
like the corporation that runs it]{.underline} --- [should be the
purpose that we 'really desire' and not a colourful
imitation."]{.underline} (Wiener, 1960; Prier, 2017) That colourful
imitation has become the norm with associations of refugees, migrants
and asylum seekers based not on dignity but premised on race and
identity politics masquerading as genuine discourse. In terms of how to
meaningfully address this inversion, I believe it necessary to borrow
from the very tactics we aim to illuminate. In a manner reminiscent of
Darko Maver, where "**[[the borders between reality and false]{.mark},
if they exist at all, [are so thin that often the roles exchange and
reality copies imitation,"]{.mark}]{.underline}** Deseriis (2010)
theorizes their method as a form of 'media homeopathy.' Where "the idea
was to inject into the media bloodstream stories whose patent falsity
would eventually induce the media immune system into a reaction of its
own." This example brings us to the most suggestive connection to the
present. The QAnon conspiracy, from the beginning, fixated on the lurid
idea of hidden child molestation rings. However, historically this is
nothing new. The middle ages were plagued with conspiracies concerning
Jewish cabals and children. (Spence, 2019) Recently, Swami (2012) noted
a positive relationship between right wing authoritarianism and beliefs
in anti-Jewish conspiracy theories, but a negative relationship with
general beliefs in conspiracy theories. It points to how individuals may
well pick and choose theories that fit with a particular political view
or belief system. Moreover, the 90s saw Italy face its version of
"Satanic Panic" around child sex abuse. Feeling that people were
baselessly targeted, Luther Blissett activists responded in an
unconventional way --- with a multiyear campaign of interconnected,
multi-city media pranks." (Davis, 2018) As Q-Anon has gotten 'unmasked'
recently in the HBO (2021) documentary Q, Into the Storm, and used to
get hosted on a site whose slogan is 'embrace infamy', it would appear
history has repeated itself through the injection of blatantly false
narratives, except this time -- it led to a clear and definitive mass
mobilization. Furthermore, states profoundly benefit from this
obfuscation, and I believe, as was the case with Trump in 2016, can have
real success from dividing people into distinct categories and
subsequently pitting these separate groups against each other. Rhetoric
based on this divisive and obfuscated nature is the link I explore that
differentiates arguments about justice, human rights, and dignity on the
one hand and the actual telos of institutions on the other. Migration,
immigration, and asylum frameworks have particularly gotten affected by
this developing phenomenon detaching its purpose from actions. What I
mean is instead of being concerned with the framework on which migration
gets premised, we have forgotten that the framework's telos or point in
favour of the outcomes that result from it. As a means to an end, the
frameworks are politicized in a Machiavellian manner, not ends in
themselves. Likewise, social media is not free as one would like to
believe. It follows a similar path as it is us who are the product,
which is done by commodifying our data. Additionally, migratory
narratives are often not concerned with promoting virtue but instead are
concerned with outcomes. Kantian autonomy and human dignity help one to
discern how this plays out; as is the case with varied frameworks, we
treat people as a means to an end and not an end in themselves. The
result: utilization of polarization for populist ends that often
scapegoat's foreigners, migrants, and refugees -- among other
fashionable outgroups, dependent on time, place, and circumstance.
(Muslims after 9/11, Turkish with BREXIT, Chinese during COVID,)

Unfortunately, as much as we have never been more connected, we are also
divided and polarized by the very tools that promote this connectivity.
Similarly, the problem with Trump's rhetoric, as with big tech, is that
the purpose or telos gets obfuscated, and as a result, many lack the
ability or context necessary to discern fundamental conceptions such as
the difference between a migrant, internally displaced person, and
refugee from broader conversations on what migratory regimes ought to
look like. A clear example of this was illustrated during Hurricane
Katrina, where many government representatives mistakenly referred to
the displaced persons as refugees. Additionally, ["**[the]{.mark}** U.S.
**[government did not]{.mark}** adequately **[protect the rights
of]{.mark}** Gulf Coast residents during displacement, failing in many
cases to prevent discrimination against **[the poor, immigrants, and
people of colour]{.mark},** and [**allowing** **children**]{.mark}, the
**[elderly, disabled persons]{.mark}** and other vulnerable populations
**[to be put in life-threatening situations]{.mark}**."]{.underline}
(Brookings, 2008, p. 5) If this occurred to those already in the US, it
is unsurprising to see this outcome on a more pervasive scale for those
with no citizenship or legal standing. On a more positive note, [despite
state powers, we also have the power to articulate concerns and voice
expectations -- albeit without a monopoly on violence like the
state]{.underline}. (Weber, 1965) As Kendzior points out, "[**[There is
a difference between expecting autocracy and accepting
autocracy]{.mark}**. It is necessary to **[expect it so that you
can]{.mark}** plan how you will **[fight]{.mark}**. But the **[battle
lines change]{.mark}**, and **[you]{.mark}** often **[end up changing
with them]{.mark}**]{.underline}." (Kendzior, 2020, p. 15) The sentiment
as mentioned above is echoed in Nietzche's quip how "he who fights with
monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou
gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee." (Nietzsche
& Zimmern, 1997, p. 52) Building on Nietzsche, I surmise the reason for
our collective spiral into distrust, fueling anti-immigrant populist
rhetoric, reflects how misinformation embodies the tale of the
mythological hydra. What I mean is, [when you cut one head off -- three
grow back to replace it]{.underline}. Similarly, [when attempting to
debunk blatantly false narratives, it only feeds further into
conspiratorial rhetoric, reinforcing the person's views that they are
getting confronted because what they view is correct.
**[Exchanges]{.mark}**]{.underline} like this [**[rob]{.mark} potential
[discourse of being]{.mark} [constructive and cannot]{.mark} reasonably
[assess]{.mark} the [credibility of varied points of
view]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Moreover, [**[cognitive dissonance
is]{.mark} a [powerful]{.mark} influence on the mind [causing
hesitations]{.mark} [regarding]{.mark} the [credibility of contradictory
information]{.mark}, especially [pertaining to
conspiracies]{.mark}**.]{.underline} (Leman & Cinnirella, 2013) A
typical interaction I have personally experienced many times manifests
as such:

One person critical of conspiratorial narratives can say, "Not
everything is intentional, and not everything has meaning," referring to
some real or imagined cabal, deep state, or conniving billionaire
suiting their predispositions (Soros, Gates, Zuckerberg, Musk, Bezos,
Trump, etc.) In response, the person defending their blatantly false
views can say, "Well... that is just your opinion," "You fell for the
misinformation," or "I did my research, you should do yours."

The distrust is so pervasive that even asking for sources for the
'research' is met with hostility, contempt, or stonewalling. As a
result, honest and credible debate cannot occur when the very foundation
the conversation rests on is negated through open-ended Socratic style
musings that talking heads like Tucker Carleson implore regularly.
(Kaufman, 2021; AP, 2020) To clarify precisely how this presents itself,
suppose I ask you, "are illegal aliens a burden to our country?" This is
precisely the bad faith musings that presuppose a determined answer. By
calling migrants, refugees, or asylum speakers' illegal aliens,' you are
already denoting them in a negative light, grouping distinct cases into
a bundle premised on the negation of the group's humanity. Additionally,
by using loaded words like 'burden' with negative connotations, the
answer is built into the question. Unfortunately, despite various
politicians, NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and citizens'
repeated assurances that it is absurd to give this type of discourse
credence, one must never forget -- even the road to hell is paved with
good intentions. Interestingly, Swami et al. (2012) demonstrated in a
controlled study how belief in entirely fictitious conspiracy theory was
significantly associated with stronger belief in other real‐world
conspiracy theories, stronger paranormal beliefs, and lower crystallized
intelligence. Nevertheless[, we must remember **[these subtle
influences]{.mark}** that guide the narratives we tell ourselves and
society collectively **[are]{.mark}** not spirits, hydras, or demons but
rather,]{.underline}

"[**[bots]{.mark} and [opaque algorithmic processes]{.mark}**,
which]{.underline} alternately and capriciously [curse or bless
us]{.underline}. One such force is, of course, Internet memes and online
content generally. Amplified and circulated by complex proprietary
information platforms hidden behind corporate obfuscation and often too
complicated even for their own engineers to fully comprehend, these
systems make their users vulnerable to external predation by harmful
forms of social influence. [The common factor in all the fears about
rampaging memes is the belief that memes are like magic, with powers to
cause real-world effects."]{.underline} (Elkus, 2021)

#### What does literature do in the face of obsession?

**Butler, 79** \[Octavia Estelle Butler was an American science fiction
author. A multiple recipient of both the Hugo and Nebula awards, she
became in 1995 the first science-fiction writer to receive a MacArthur
Fellowship. Born in Pasadena, California, Butler was raised by her
widowed mother, "Positive Obsession"/ -ekh-\]

[There seems to be an **unwritten rule, hurtful** and at odds with the
realities of American culture]{.underline}. It says [you aren't supposed
to wonder whether as a Black person, a Black woman, you really might be
inferior]{.underline}---**[not]{.underline}** quite **[bright
enough]{.underline}**, not quite **[quick enough]{.underline}**, not
quite [**good enough** to do the things you want to do]{.underline}.
Though, of course, you do wonder. [You're supposed to know you're as
good as anyone.]{.underline} And if you don't know, you aren't supposed
to admit it. If anyone near you admits it, you're supposed to reassure
them quickly so they'll shut up. That sort of talk is embarrassing.
[**Act tough and confident** and **don't talk about your
doubts**.]{.underline} If you never deal with them, you may never get
rid of them, but no matter. Fake everyone out. Even yourself.

I couldn't fake myself out. I didn't talk much about my doubts. I wasn't
fishing for hasty reassurances. But I did a lot of thinking---the same
things over and over.

Who was I anyway? Why should anyone pay attention to what I had to say?
Did I have anything to say[? I was writing science fiction and fantasy,
for God's sake. At that time nearly all professional science-fiction
writers were white men. As much as I loved science fiction and fantasy,
what was I doing?]{.underline}

Well, whatever it was, I couldn't stop. [**Positive obsession is about
not being able to stop** just because you're afraid and full of doubts.
**Positive obsession is dangerous**. It's about **not being able to stop
at all**]{.underline}

I was twenty-three when, finally, I sold my first two short stories. I
sold both to writer-editors who were teaching at Clarion, a
science-fiction writers' workshop that I was attending. One story was
eventually published. The other wasn't. I didn't sell another word for
five years. Then, finally, I sold my first novel. Thank God no one told
me selling would take so long ---not that I would have believed it. I've
sold eight novels since then. Last Christmas, I paid off the mortgage on
my mother's house.

So, then, [I write science fiction and fantasy for a
living]{.underline}. As far as I know [I'm still the only Black woman
who does this.]{.underline} When I began to do a little public speaking,
one of the questions I heard most often was, "[**What good is science
fiction to Black people?**" I was usually asked this by a Black person.
I gave bits and pieces of answers that didn't satisfy me and that
probably didn't satisfy my questioners. I resented the question. **Why
should I have to justify my profession to anyone**?]{.underline}

But the answer to that was obvious. [There was exactly one other Black
science-fiction writer working successfully]{.underline} when I sold my
first novel: Samuel R. Delany, Jr. [Now there are four of
us]{.underline}. Delany, Steven Barnes, Charles R. Saunders, and me. [So
few. Why? Lack of interest? Lack of confidence? A young Black woman once
said to me, "I always wanted to write science fiction, but I didn't
think there were any Black women doing it."]{.underline} Doubts show
themselves in all sorts of ways. But still I'm asked, **[what good is
science fiction to Black people?]{.underline}**

**[What good is any form of literature to Black people?]{.underline}**

[What good is science fiction's thinking about the **present, the
future, and the past**?]{.underline} What good is [its tendency to warn
or to **consider alternative ways of thinking and doing**?]{.underline}
What good is [its examination of the possible effects of science and
technology, or social organization and political direction?]{.underline}
At its best, science fiction stimulates imagination and creativity. It
gets reader and writer off the beaten track, off the narrow, narrow
footpath of what "everyone" is saying, doing, thinking ---whoever
"everyone" happens to be this year.

**[And what good is all this to Black people?]{.underline}**

#### The embracement of Black speculative fiction through our 1AC creates agentive forms of intimacy and resistance within white spaces that crowd out discussions of black life. This intervention counters logics of whiteness that seek to desire but terminally destroy Black disabled persons. 

**Pickens 19** \[Therí Alyce Pickens, Professor of English, specializing
in African American, Arab America and disability literatures and
theories at Bates University, June 7, 2019 "Black Madness :: Mad
Blackness", Duke University Press, Durham and London, pgs. 36-41, JMH\]

Both frustrating and fascinating, Black speculative fiction writer and
pioneer Octavia E. Butler renders intimate, personal relationships with
an eye toward complexity and compromise.35 Her characters' investment in
each other does not necessarily equate to a divestment from the
oppressive ideologies that buoy their power[. Most important for this
inquiry, [Butler's work foregrounds the spaces of discomfort and erasure
that accompany Black madness.]{.mark} As noted in the preface and
introduction, I view Butler as a theorist working in the medium of
fiction. I analyze her archive and her final published novel Fledgling
(2005), interpreting the intimate relationships she
depicts.]{.underline} Here, I invest in the "politics of the possible"
regarding modes of interpretation that function as alternatives to
mutual constitution.36 [**Elsewhere I have discussed [the enemy
relationships]{.mark} in Butler's Fledgling, pinpointing that the
protagonist's enemies "\[[mobilize\] racist rhetoric subsequent to
failed ableist rhetoric]{.mark}."37 [Their motives]{.mark} and their
ideas [are easily understood as a threat to the protagonist's life, a
desire for her erasure,]{.mark} since [their engagement with Blackness
and disability relies on a denigration of both.]{.mark}** This
discomfort and erasure flows from the protagonist's lovers, friends, and
family as well.]{.underline} Here, the discourses of madness and
Blackness vie for importance, a competition of sorts in which neither
can win, but where the decision to prioritize one over the other shifts
the emotional and ideological terrain, particularly in the interracial,
multiability encounter. [Butler theorizes that Black madness creates a
crisis of the self in which subjectivity and identity is destabilized
and the conception of the future altered.]{.underline} Butler
conceptualized Fledgling as a coming-of-age and chase narrative that
follows the structure of a crime procedural. In a letter to her editor
she writes, "This one is essentially Shori's \[the protagonist's\]
struggle to rebuild her life in spite of her lost family and
memory---and, of course, she can only rebuild if she finds those who are
hunting her and her love ones and stop them. In Law and Order fashion,
she does this first through physical action--- looking for answers,
finding them, getting surprised, fighting to stay alive. . . . Then
there's the trial---a less physically active part of the story, but one
just as involved in its own conflict and drama."38 [The first third of
the novel follows Shori as she awakes with amnesia, learns that she is a
vampire (called Ina) from her father, Iosif, and finds human companions,
including Wright, Celia, and Brooke (called symbionts, abbreviated as
syms) to survive.]{.underline} During this time, she learns that what
separates her from other Ina is genetic experimentation with human blood
that grants her melanin and the capacity to remain awake during the day.
[The middle third of the novel depicts her adjustment to her new
symbionts, including three same-gender loving relationships with syms
Theodora, Celia, and Brooke, and her alliance with the male Ina family
to whom she was/is betrothed (the Gordons).]{.underline} The final third
delineates the trial, or Council of Judgment, which determines truth and
consequences for those Ina who attempted to murder her, and successfully
murdered her family (Silk family, Dahlman family). Butler's notebooks
and journals reveal that she conceptualized several sequels to
Fledgling. [She completed five chapters of a novel tentatively called
Asylum or Flight. In it, she introduces a new symbiont, a newfound
archive from Shori's mothers, and the drama of being kidnapped by
unmated male members of the Silk family.]{.underline} In the journal
entries months before her death, Butler rethinks the story line of
kidnapping and considers the story of a seduction, where Shori must
build a family of symbionts and Ina sisters.39 Within Fledgling,
[several [intimate relationships]{.mark}---the Gordon family, Daniel
Gordon, Shori's symbionts---[clarify how Black madness disrupts the
ideological field]{.mark}: their behavior clarifies that the reading
strategy of [mutual constitution elides the competition between
Blackness and madness for narrative space]{.mark}, [the impossibility of
linear progressive understandings]{.mark} of history and time, [and the
fiction of Black mad resistance as always agentive]{.mark}.]{.underline}
As a family, the Gordons remain in thrall to their able-bodied and race
privilege, such that it governs their interpretations of Shori. They
"deploy an evaluative gaze that assesses Shori's 'fitness' based on
their own criteria--- shaped as it is by abled embodiment. [The Gordons
constitute fitness based on criteria that demonstrate their ignorance
about the systemic effect whiteness and ability have had on their
lives."40 Since they do not distinguish between her amnesia as
impairment and Ina cultural and traditional customs as fomenting
disability, they exude a paternalism that becomes taxing for Shori to
navigate.]{.underline} She must consistently remind them that her
impairment has practical implications to which their cultural structures
(such as the Council of Judgment or mating rituals) must adapt.41 She
reminds them, "My memory goes back a few weeks and no further," and the
narration explicates her emotional response, "And because I was annoyed.
I let my tone of voice say, You should all realize this. I've explained
it before."42 Further, **[[they neglect to think of her
Blackness]{.mark} as more than just the genetic engineering
experimentation that allows her to be awake during the day. [They
consider her melanin useful as part of her physiology but do not think
through the implications of how it creates her outsider
status]{.mark}]{.underline}.** [The Gordons rank her identities: her
Blackness as more beneficial, her amnesia as more pitiable, her
Blackness as less important, her amnesia as less desirable.]{.underline}
Their logic views the two identities as competitive in their narration
of events: only one category requires their attention at any given time.
[Their priorities reveal how one identity, disability, is a problem for
them that they can articulate. Her other identity, Blackness, is a
problem to be sure, but one about which they cannot answer a word.43
Further, it stresses that their [deliberate problematizing of one
identity parses Blackness and madness for their own comfort.]{.mark}
When Butler portrays Shori as frustrated in addition to misunderstood,
she debunks the idea that all one must do is fuse the identities
together]{.underline}. [In other words, it is not necessarily a problem
that the Gordons must strategize about Shori's disability (especially
since doing so will help save her life), but rather that they seek to
strategize without fully understanding the disability itself (and how it
is shaped by Blackness) and without her input.]{.underline} [In this
instance, [Black madness cannot be agentive or radical or resistant all
by itself.]{.mark} Shori's mere presence cannot bear the weight of
reorienting the narrative all on its own, nor can her behavior
automatically shift the ideologies that govern her circumstances or
change the people who helped create and sustain them (which, by default,
includes the Gordon family). Instead, Butler's work suggests that
[allies]{.mark} themselves [must reconcile the competing tension between
their own privileged positions and their desires for
inclusivity]{.mark}. Though Shori can marshal her embodied knowledge to
instruct others, she has limited success. The Gordons' gaze functions
similarly to that of Shori's enemies. [Their intimate interaction
highlights that the difference between the two]{.mark}---that is, good
intention---[requires more labor on Shori's part]{.mark} (which by
itself curtails agency). She cannot dismiss the Gordons because they are
not antagonists; instead, she must reframe the conversation to emphasize
her position as potential daughter-in-law in need of
assistance.]{.underline} When Shori reminds them, "So far \[her\]
problem is ignorance, not dishonesty,"44 she splices impairment from
disability and suggests listening as an integral facet of engagement.
[Yet [her interactions with the older Gordons remain taxing and
frustrating because their good intentions do not match the impact of
their behavior]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Their remarks---[she is "somewhat
arrogant"]{.mark} or she must "seem more Ina than \[the antagonists\],"
or [she is "both very attractive and very frightening"]{.mark}45---belie
their weddedness to ableism, [even as they attempt to help her navigate
institutionalized barriers. It is up to them to shift their thinking,
and it is not clear that ever occurs by the end of
Fledgling]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In Butler's drafts of Fledgling, she
toys with the way Shori's Black madness structures her interactions with
the Gordons and the text writ large]{.underline}. [Each instantiation of
the novel evinces Butler's commitment to depicting Blackness and madness
as destabilizing forces, which heighten and problematize privilege
because they shift the contours of the multiability, interracial
encounter.]{.underline} The two discourses work together and, in that
sense, remain coextensive, but they also function at cross-purposes. For
instance, Shori speculates that the Gordons test her when they allow her
to question the human agents responsible for the arson that killed her
family.

[MY MOTHER read me bedtime stories until I was six years
old]{.underline}. It was a sneak attack on her part. As soon as I really
got to like the stories, she said, "Here's the book. Now you read."
**[She didn't know what she was setting us both up for.]{.underline}**

"[I think," my mother said to me one day]{.underline} when I was ten,
"[that **everyone has something that they can do better than they can do
anything else**. It's up to them to find out what that something
is]{.underline}." We were in the kitchen by the stove. She was pressing
my hair while I sat bent over someone's cast-off notebook, writing. I
had decided to write down some of the stories I'd been telling myself
over the years. [When I didn't have stories to read, I learned to make
them up. Now **I was learning to write them down.**]{.underline}

[I was shy, afraid of most people, most situations. I didn't stop to ask
myself how things could hurt me, or even whether they could hurt me. **I
was just afraid**]{.underline}. I crept into my first bookstore full of
vague fears. I had managed to save about five dollars, mostly in change.
It was 1957. Five dollars was a lot of money for a ten-year-old. The
public library had been my second home since I was six, and I owned a
number of hand-me-down books. But now I wanted a new book---one I had
chosen, one I could keep.

"Can kids come in here?" I asked the woman at the cash register once I
was inside. I meant could Black kids come in. My mother, born in rural
Louisiana and raised amid strict racial segregation, had warned me that
I might not be welcome everywhere, even in California.

[The cashier glanced at me. "Of course you can come in," she said. Then,
as though it were an afterthought, she smiled. I relaxed.]{.underline}

The first book I bought described the characteristics of different
breeds of horses. The second described stars and planets, asteroids,
moons and comets

My aunt and I were in her kitchen, talking. She was cooking something
that smelled good, and I was sitting at her table, watching. Luxury. At
home, my mother would have had me helping

["I want to be a writer when I grow up," I said.]{.underline}

["Do you?" my aunt asked. "Well, that's nice, but you'll have to get a
job, too."]{.underline}

["You can write any time. It's a nice hobby. But you'll have to earn a

[I was most adamant when I didn't know what I was talking about. In all

[[The **essential duty**]{.mark} of the one [is to **struggle for
the**]{.mark} **realization or consciousness of the
[cyborg]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The cyborg is [born at that moment in
which the convergence of interests among anyone and everyone seeking or
dodging freedom is inescapable and inescapably recognized]{.underline};
**[the cyborg [glimpses the possibilities of permanent
revolution]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as the veil descends. [This
convergence is [cemented in more than blood and rational choice]{.mark}.
It is [shaped by **imagination** and **memory**, **longing** and
**aversion**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Fanon's 1960s writings about the Algerian war of liberation from the
French illuminate aspects of the 1980s Cold War's détente. The first,
like all of the post--World War II battles for freedom in Africa, Asia,
Latin America, the Caribbean, and Middle East (and the "internal
colonies" in the Americas and beyond), was asymmetrical warfare. The
Cold War was not. Both forms of warfare, hot or cold, were in the
postwar era largely fought on or against the bodies of the colonized.2

[To inhibit nuclear proliferation between two waning
empires]{.underline}, the United States and the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics (USSR), diplomats and activists crafted new
vocabulary. **[[M]{.mark}utual [a]{.mark}ssured
[d]{.mark}estruction]{.underline}** (MAD) [[was coined]{.mark} as the
language of rational-minded Westerners seeking [to **preserve**
what]{.mark} they [had **accumulated or
appropriated**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In order [to avoid an
apocalypse]{.underline}--- at least for the imperial
crowd---[[**sobering reality** would **dictate**]{.mark} the
[**demilitarization** of East and West **and**]{.mark} the [**playing
out of antagonisms** on]{.mark} Third World terrain where the casualties
against **[bodies already dehumanized]{.mark}** by Europe **would not
create** significant **political collateral damages** in either
democracies or dictatorships of the people]{.underline}.3

"Concerning Violence" exhibits contempt for superpowers and their
respective blocs or adherents for the native who has completed a
revolutionary struggle against the colonizer and now enters the world
arena as a leader. For Fanon, [**[diplomacy is]{.mark}** simply
[another]{.mark} war strategy or [strategy of **maneuver** to
**safeguard**]{.mark} [the]{.mark} newly emerging [nation that seeks to
**avoid becoming a neocolony or a "failed state."**]{.mark} [Fanon
offers]{.mark} the possibilities of [a **diplomacy that is dynamic,
alive, and insurgent**]{.mark}: a "strange contrast to the motionless,
petrified world of colonization"]{.underline} (1963: 78). He cites
several examples of "boorish" or inappropriate behavior on the part of
those ostracized or distanced by the West: "\[When\] Mr. Khrushchev
brandishes his shoe at the United Nations, or thumps the table with it,
there's not a single ex-native, nor any representative of an
underdeveloped country, who laughs. For what Mr. Khrushchev shows the
colonized countries which are looking on is that he, the moujik, who
moreover is the possessor of space rockets, treats those miserable
capitalists in the way that they deserve" (78).

Fanon finds the theatre of Soviets similar to that of the Cuban
representatives, although only the latter fought a prolonged bloody war
in the postwar period. Thus there is a profound difference in the ways
in which Fanon describes the implications of Nikita Khrushchev's
pounding of footgear and Fidel Castro's presentation of war as
bloodshed, not mere theater:

[[In the same way, **Castro sitting in military uniform in** the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[N]{.mark}**ations **[O]{.mark}**rganization [does
not scandalize the underdeveloped countries. What Castro]{.mark}
[demonstrates is the consciousness he has of the]{.mark} continuing
existence of the [rule of violence]{.mark}.]{.underline} The astonishing
thing is that he did not come into the UNO with a machine-gun; but if he
had would anyone have minded? [[All]{.mark} the jacqueries and desperate
[deeds]{.mark}, all those [bands armed with]{.mark} cutlasses or [axes
find their nationality in the implacable struggle which]{.mark} [opposes
socialism and capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. (78)

There is a violence reserved for the colonized both as receiver and as
proponent that seems predictable and part of the biopolitical world he
or she is reduced to living and being perceived as living. Khrushchev by
some accounts actually seems to have enjoyed his visit to the United
States (embracing at arm's length, with considerable threat, his distant
Euro cousins). The same cannot be said of Castro (who would be subject
to multiple assassination attempts by the CIA), unless one counts
perhaps his visit with Malcolm X in Harlem and his stay at the Theresa
Hotel in Harlem when hotels in downtown Manhattan denied accommodations
for the Cuban leader and his entourage.

"Concerning Violence" intimates that the Soviet/Eastern bloc would be an
adventurer in Third World freedom and as opportunistic as the West in
its own fashion. However, Fanon does not explicate, writing in the
height of decolonization struggles against Western imperialism and
before the Soviet collapse, how the specter of Western colonization and
the benign face of Soviet domination, through weapons and currency to
those seeking freedom from the West and United States, might in fact
mutate into a shared body or host. [**[One cohort in alliance against
black freedom]{.mark}**, one **corporate-military state conglomerate**
that understood its feeding grounds to be the "wretched of the
earth"---the [**black, brown, yellow bodies who had not morphed or
blossomed into cyborgs capable of resisting** colonization and
slavery]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Understandably [Fanon need not depict an adversary so grotesque in its
abilities to consume black life. He can focus on the colonialist, the
French settler as the enemy formation, although this colonialist or
settler is actually just an errand boy for another, more formidable
foe]{.underline}. [Fanon]{.underline}, without confronting the
increasing concentration of military power and finance witnessed in the
twenty-first century, offers [[a **redemptive possibility beyond
enlightenment**]{.mark} or rational self-interest or choice; he offers
**[an apocalypse of sorts]{.mark}.** For **[when]{.mark}** the
**["one"]{.mark} solitary [merges with others to become the
revolutionary]{.mark}**, he or she is no longer a conventional
human.]{.underline} [**[As cyborg]{.mark}**, as [**one/mass** **unified
against**]{.mark} **the [divine, mechanical, and biological terror of
the colonizer]{.mark}**, as its own biological, mechanical, and divine
formation, **[a human being as a conventional being no longer
exists]{.mark}** (at least **[momentarily]{.mark}**).]{.underline}

[Revolutions]{.underline} of course [mark the end of time and space as
conventionally understood and relied on. **What happens when the human
becomes part machine and part divine, the alternate manifestation
to**]{.underline} what **[the Fourteenth Amendment]{.underline}** to the
US Constitution, an amendment theoretically crafted for former enslaved
blacks, created [when it enabled corporations to become cyborgs by
allowing them humanity or political personhood?]{.underline}
[What,]{.underline} then, [is the predictability of time and space in a
struggle between cyborgs?]{.underline} And would such a struggle of
unequal equals be a form of MAD?

[**[If the enslaved or colonized disappear as materiality and
consciousness]{.mark}**, then the consciousness of **[the enslaver and
colonialist is left homeless]{.mark}**, **[a]{.mark}** roaming
**[ghost]{.mark}**, the zombie that **Fanon mocks the native for
fearing** more than her oppressor or the secret police. **[The
enslaver]{.mark}** and the colonialist **[without the slave]{.mark}** or
native **[cannot haunt themselves]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Thus [**[the
colonialist or enslaver would be insane or suicidal to usher in the
henceforward moment in which every native is
massacred]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The [disintegration of the multitude
of individual natives is based on their common vulnerabilities to
suffering as slaves or colonized folks]{.underline}. Their **[[pain
becomes a weapon against their oppressor]{.underline}]{.mark}** (who,
although decapitated, is still capable of a lethal strike).

#### The conceptualization of the black cyborg ruptures whiteness's frame of technology as the tool of the colonial master. Theorizing through the black cyborg is a tool for the becoming resists the assumption that technology is the province of white ingenuity and that technological engagement is incompatible with Black culture.

In her article, "New Genres of Being Human: World Making through Viral
Blackness," Ashleigh Greene Wade's approach is similar to Puar's with
its shared roots in assemblage theory and commitment to thinking through
new frameworks for being. From an explicitly Black feminist framework,
she calls in Sylvia Wynter and Wehilye to a discussion of assemblage in
order to power her central argument: [[we have shifted into a new way of
experiencing our]{.mark} own humanness and [subjectivity]{.mark}, and it
is an experience [that]{.mark} fundamentally [weaves our physical selves
with our digital experiences]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Weaving together
Black techno-social practices and Black feminist notions of the human,
Greene Wade produces a significant development toward theorizing the
virtual-physical assemblage.]{.underline} Central to Greene Wade's
analysis is the idea of virality and viral Blackness. [She names
virality as "an affective condition in which content spreads widely,
changing both the form of the original content and the channels through
which it passes]{.underline}." She calls upon Puar and Patricia Clough
as interlocutors in the conversation of virality, citing their
introduction to the Women's Studies Quarterly volume devoted to the
concept of virality which notes the spread of "viral" as a descriptor
for things happening in biological, physical, financial, linguistic, and
cultural realms. [Greene Wade notes the fear that [the word "viral" can
evoke]{.mark}; the dominant use of viral is in [discussion of spreading
disease]{.mark}. While she urges us to expand beyond this fear and
critically engage with the viral as a generative concept, I like to
linger on the fear component of Black virality. The fear is essential
for understanding how [the Black viral has been]{.mark} tracked,
[surveilled]{.mark}, and covered: [the white gaze looks upon Black viral
phenomena]{.mark} [with]{.mark} equal parts intrigue, confusion, and
[fear]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its effects are visible: [social movements
spring up, hashtags trend, bodies show up, information is
shared]{.underline}. [The methods remain opaque, rendered as invisible
as a virus]{.underline}. As Greene Wade notes, [[the most terrifying
aspect of viral Blackness is its uncontrollable
nature]{.underline}:]{.mark} "[[Within the carceral state, containment
is extremely important for maintaining control]{.mark}, [but]{.mark}
[the viral cannot be contained]{.mark}. While the source of viral
content can be located, once it is released, control societies cannot
dictate how or where it spreads]{.underline}." [This [uncontrollable,
mutable, spreading form of viral Blackness manages]{.mark} [to blend the
boundaries between the virtual and physical]{.mark}, to muddy binaries,
[and to resist legibility to whiteness]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The
subversion of control found in viral Blackness]{.mark} [is]{.mark} part
of [what]{.mark} I will argue [makes Black feminist cyborgs so
effectively able to travel worlds]{.mark}.]{.underline} [When mutability
and shape-shifting themselves assist, viral Blackness becomes a powerful
tool for achieving and maintaining a sense of cultural
control]{.underline}. The most critical aspect of the functioning of
viral Blackness is the political force we are able to exert in digital
spaces and manifest offline. Greene Wade asks us to consider the
emergence of viral Blackness through #BlackLivesMatter (among other
associated hashtags) and place it in the context of Black technological
activism. [She cites the mobilization efforts in 2014 around Ferguson,
particularly organizing buses of protestors and funds and resources for
protestors on the ground. She points to pre-social media periods,
referencing events as far back as 1997, when Black women honed early
Internet resources to organize the Million Woman March.]{.underline} [In
this project, I place this work in the framework of Anna Everett's
"Black technophilia," the basic concept that [Black people's love for
and skill with technology is neither rare nor deficient but is part of
the tradition of Black people's innovation in finding and creating tools
for survival]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Greene Wade's analysis, hashtags,
viral videos, and images from [Black protests and demonstrations are not
only tools, but also "material artifacts of viral
Blackness."]{.underline} Greene Wade concludes her article by making the
case that weak, appropriative, derivative hashtags stemming from
#BlackLivesMatter serve to highlight the ways viral Blackness disquiets
and disrupts white supremacy. #AllLivesMatter and #BlueLivesMatter, for
instance, rest on outmoded and fixed identity categories. She issues a
call: "[We have to release Blackness from essentialism so that it may be
deployed toward liberation within a multiplicity of
subjectivities]{.underline}." [Moving toward conceiving of a Blackness
that operates as a virtual-physical assemblage is part of that
vision]{.underline}. Though Greene Wade does not mention cyborgs, I
place this essay and Puar's essay in conversation to illuminate my
vision of the makeup of the cyborg: [[the Black feminist cyborg is a
virtual-physical becoming-intersectional assemblage]{.mark}, slinking
and [changing from one world to the next]{.mark}, armored on digital
platforms and able to shapeshift beyond the rigid grids of identity
politics on technosocial platforms]{.underline}. [This theory demands
that we re-think what a cyborg i]{.underline}s. In the intellectual
tradition of Puar, [[conceptualizing a cyborg as humanity and technology
gracelessly mashed together]{.mark} [leaves us with an
i]{.mark}ndelicate and relatively [worthless metaphor]{.mark}. If we
think about a cyborg as a new genre of being, the way Sylvia Wynter via
Greene Wade ask us to think about humans, it prepares us to imagine the
cyborg as a virtual-physical assemblage equipped to both travel through
and make worlds for Black feminists who seek refuge, feminist discourse,
and methods for moving through online spaces.]{.underline} [[The
part-time Black feminist cyborg is able to move as Black women so often
do: as part of a side-hust]{.mark}le, as part of an informal, widespread
Black aesthetic devoted to [hustling in the margins]{.mark}, seeking and
[performing community support]{.mark} and maintenance, gaining insight
from other places and people to be repurposed [toward Black
excellence]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Black feminist cyborg side-hustle
is one which pays in security, heightened ability, heightened
perception, and occasionally heightened suffering. Though the "side
hustle" is a language of labor, it is labor performed for self and
community. [I take Joy James' critique of Black cyborgs operating as
super-human seriously, and argue that [the part-time nature of this
aesthetic allows for breaks]{.mark}, rest, and centering of the self
[rather than super-human strength and performance to please and serve
whiteness]{.mark} and white people]{.underline}. The part-time hustle
allows for anonymity: no one need know about your alternate cyborg mode
of being. [If we are all to embody a new genre of being human and become
virtual-physical assemblages, the part-time [Black feminist cyborg
theory serves as a method]{.mark}, a tool [for the becoming]{.mark}.
This concept quickly falls apart if there is commitment to the tool of
technology as it has been traditionally discussed, even among feminist
thinkers, as dominance and conquest through mechanical and digital
means. Black feminist speculative fiction authors can offer us an
alternative way of thinking through definitions of technology, often
advocating a reassessment of what technology]{.underline} is, [can be,
and has been in the hands of Black people]{.underline}. In the
interviews I conducted, I asked each participant two main questions
related to the nature of technology: how have you conceived of or
grappled with themes of technology in your speculative fiction work? And
what would you consider the most dominant messages about Black people,
bodies and technology that come from popular culture or mainstream
speculative fiction? In response to the first question, participants
frequently mentioned cyborgs, the steampunk genre as a space to toy with
our preconceived notions, and expansive definitions of technology.
Tempest K. Bradford responded: I mean, technically, again, the novel I'm
writing now, it's steampunk, so there is a technology in it even though
it's in the past. The technology is what is driving the commentary about
social change\[,\] my commentary on 71 inequality\[,\] because in this
story, it's set in ancient Egypt. The steampunk elements are copper
scarab beetles that are really big. People ride around in them and they
run on the power of steam generated by sunlight. adrienne maree brown
noted that she had grappled with themes of technology in her speculative
fiction work "sort of flailingly? Like, I mostly imagine futures where
technology is invisible or inside of us, cyborgish, enhancements. I also
think of technology as how we do everything." Encapsulating both themes,
Walidah Imarisha comments on the whitewashing of the definition of
technology and steampunk as a site of reproducing racist and colonial
narratives, and as a means of expanding and responding to definitions of
technology for Black survival: I think having conversations about what
technology is, is also really important from the beginning. [I think
that [we think of technology in a very]{.mark} Western, European
[white-centered frame]{.mark}. And so, I think that it's important to
recognize that a lot of the ways we think about
technology]{.underline}\... I think that steampunk is a genre \[that\]
actually is a really useful way to sort of externalize the implicit
conversations that often happen about technology--- the way\... that
[[technology is intimately linked to colonialism and the global spread
of white supremacy]{.mark} \[in\] this sort of white racist utopian
fantasy that white folks create when they create steampunk]{.underline}.
So. You know, I think, again, if technology is not a useful term, then
we just don't use that term. I do think it's useful to challenge that
idea and saying, well, what is our definition of technology? Technology
is actually much broader than just externalized robotic gadgets that
often are what we think of when we think of technology. So I think
that's one thing. I think the other thing, I definitely feel like I
think about technology a lot. \[I have\] a couple pieces that center
around \[technology\] that I'm working on. I'm actually working on
developing a workshop that takes current developments and technology
that folks think of as science fiction, but that are here now, and then
has folks kind of imagine how this might be used against us in the
future as folks try to change the world, because it will. And then
develop potential strategies to challenge that... I don't think we can
deny the digital technological advances that exist in this world. I
think we do so at our own peril. 72 In line with their thinking about
expanding both ideas of technology and "cyborgish" ways of being, I find
something productive and playful about imagining taking on the label of
a cyborg, which requires being built, shaped, taken apart, and
re-imagined in the face of oppression. There are deep resonances between
descriptions of the cyborg and the experiences of being a Black woman:
feeling like a being both out of time and somehow advanced, forced to
travel worlds the way Lugones describes, continually being drawn both
into the past and the future, losing limbs and gaining playfulness along
the way. The cyborg concept has been considered by many feminist
theorists in the decades since Haraway's introduction and is
increasingly relevant in the face of continuing technological advances.
In TechnoFeminism, Judy Wajcman calls our attention to this fascination
with the cyborg when she notes, "The cyborg has fired the feminist
imagination. It crystalizes our pleasure in, desire for, and anxiety
about technological transcendence. Perhaps this, and the infinite
flexibility of what has become the postmodern icon, explains its
rhetorical force." Cyborg metaphors about the Black body and Black
experience are present in literature, art, popular culture, and academic
theory; indeed, Haraway specifically mentions the Black speculative
fiction endeavors of Samuel Delany and Octavia Butler in her manifesto,
appreciating them among other prolific feminist science fiction writers
as "storytellers exploring what it means to be embodied in 73 high tech
worlds," and that they operate as "theorists for cyborgs." Women of
color is the category of coalition that Lugones writes about, framing
their unique ability for worldtraveling as a result of marginalized
positionality. The cyborg in Haraway's conception is also portrayed as
an ideal creature for moving "between worlds," as Lugones describes
them, or, into and out of the margins. Fused with technology and flesh,
the vulnerability and adaptability of the cyborg allows for the variety
of shifts in perspective required for moving between
worlds---perception, vulnerability, and adaptability being kinds of
technologies of their own. [Moving into Digital Worlds [The Black
feminist cyborg resists the assumption that technology is the province
of white ingenuity and intelligence]{.mark}, and that technological
engagement is incompatible with Black people and Black
culture]{.underline}. [[Claiming space in discourses of social
technologies can push back against the limited kinds of knowledge
production]{.mark} that people of color can produce that is legible
within white supremacy]{.underline}. A modern cyborg still lives in a
humandominated world with a very narrow conception of humanity. As
Haraway acknowledges science fiction writers as cyborg theorists, I also
turn to the writers I interviewed for their reflections on Black bodies
and technology. Their contributions offer vital insights into both the
genre of science fiction and real-world digital landscapes. [Black women
74 operating as part-time cyborgs must move through these digital
worlds, which provide new conditions for loving perception]{.underline}.
A Black feminist cyborg is continually adapting to digital worlds where
physical safety is less likely to be threatened and our access to one
another is unprecedented. A Black feminist cyborg practical aesthetic is
ideal for traveling to these worlds mediated through social media
platforms, where we extend our Blackness beyond our physical bodies and
simultaneously become aware of the embodied ways technology mediates and
fuses with our lived realities. Black Cyborgs Moving Forward I have
positioned the Black feminist cyborg as an ontological approach and a
creature of fiction, but I would be remiss if I did not mention the
rapidly closing gap between the cyborg as fiction and the cyborg as
reality. In my interview with speculative fiction author Walidah
Imarisha, the subject of bio-hacking was discussed in relationship to
some of her latest writing and activist work. [For example, she is in
the process of developing a workshop which has participants think about
concepts like bio-hacking, the import of technological and mechanical
tools into one's body, often imagined as science fiction but already
part of reality, and strategize ways to combat their inevitable use
against Black bodies]{.underline}. Her upcoming fictional work
incorporates bio-hacking themes to underscore both the anxiety about
technological additions to bodies and Black resistance 75 to methods of
white social control over Black bodies. [Citing facial recognition
software newly employed in airports and the recent trend of corporations
bio-hacking willing employees with identifying chips, she tells an
oppositional story of a dystopic world in which characters are guided by
self-implanted chips that point them in the direction of the North
Star]{.underline}. In the interview, she describes the research she
conducted for background in her story. She says, with both the
excitement and trepidation that the idea of fusion with technology,
especially for Black people, can bring: "The piece I was reading about
was folks, like, bio-hacking themselves and becoming cyborgs! And
getting superhero powers, basically. I was like, [**[this shit is
real]{.mark}**, y'all, people are cyborgs right now]{.underline}!"
[Imarisha calls our attention to the narrowing divide between [the
cyborg]{.mark} as a creature of fiction and a creature of reality and
imagines the way Black people can use technology to combat white
supremacy. This speculative work through a Black feminist lens is
imperative, because it challenges the notion that Black people can only
interact with technology to serve white supremacist aims, and it rejects
the erasure of Black people's long, rich relationship with science and
technology]{.underline}. [It [is transgressive in that it rejects the
notion that Black people's bodies and minds operate as machines and
tools]{.mark}, having technology used on and through them]{.underline}.
As I demonstrate in chapter four, Black people 76 harness the
technological tools available to them and created by them. As social
media drives much of Trump-era political discourse, Black people use it
to facilitate cultural conversations, strategize for livable and
desirable futures, and center the experiences of marginalized people.

the experience of moving in between the digital and physical, with room

examples of world-traveling Black part-time cyborgs from popular media.
These examples from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and the discography of
Janelle Monáe illuminate the way loving perception partnered with cyborg

#### The role of the judge is to be an immediator not a mediator, mediation is undergirded by logistical whiteness that seeks out the destruction of the excessive share. Immediation is not a neutral process, rather a subjective force of thirdness that interjects between the two in the name of liberation from the logistical path of existence.

We already know how the story ends. On May 29, 2021, the headline reads:
"Canada mourns as remains of 215 children found at indigenous school."8
It wasn't an indigenous school, of course. It was a residential school,
a Canadian school, in the clearing. The picture says it all: sparse
trees growing in the background, empty yard, an architecture completely
at odds with the environment, cleared of life, of all that immanently
interconnects. [The violence of logistics is inscribed in the ghost
trees of its whitened surround. How we organize bodies, we who sidle
whiteness, how we excise (from clear sight) the ravages of an earth
desecrated, of a people brutally murdered---these are the workings of
logistics. Logistics mediate existence by keeping it at arm's
length]{.underline}, [soothing us into believing that we are not
responsible]{.underline}. The deaths are newsworthy, and we're sorry,
but we must move on. It's not really about us and in any case, there's
nothing we can do about it[. [Let's get a mediator and sort this
out!]{.underline}]{.mark} [At arms length, we see these workings---the
cleared forest, the dying planet, the dead children---as somehow
disconnected. We do not acknowledge the felling of the trees as the
wanton destruction of all that transversally connects.]{.underline} [And
yet logistics, in its power of mediation, is all about the forests. It's
all about the cotton planted in their wake.]{.underline} The ghostly
outline of Proulx's pine table haunts the residential school, its
absence equal to the absence of education. Because what the residential
school really does is unteach. Taking the place of pedagogy, what is
practiced here is theft. Theft of thought, of imagination. This theft is
a rape. A physical rape, a sexual aggression, but also a conceptual
rape, a clearing---"to snatch, to grab, to carry off by force"---of all
that lives in the abyss of what has been left behind.9 Rape, relation
severed, cuts the fragile interwoven threads of existence, wresting life
from life-living, from the more-than that gives it its spirited and
spiritual contour. If body is land, if bodying is only ever worlding,
what residential school does, in this most recent form of clearing, is
sever this imbrication, leaving the body lifeless. [All that remains is
the clearing. And a mess. But this can be handled. [This is how
mediation does its work, in the name of and as
logistics]{.mark}.]{.underline} [From here on in, things will be
managed. [Managers will be appointed to organize, to administer, the
now-reduced environment]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark} science of
loss---"which is to say the science of whiteness, or logistics"---[is
predicated on]{.mark} the end of sharing, on [the destruction of the
excessive share]{.mark}, the annihilation of that which exceeds the
one-two form whose dramaturgy relies of the intervention of the
mediator.]{.underline}10 [The mediator will take the form of the "yellow
eyebrows" in Proulx's account, but it also need not take a simple human
form]{.underline}. [Repetition of the same is the form it takes in a
dramaturgy of extinction]{.underline}. Scene 3 Clearing produces
property. Property produces dispossession. "All property is loss because
all property is the loss of sharing."11 [The accursed share of all that
exceeds interpersonality, mediation, whiteness, logistics, all that
cannot be accounted for, sickens the]{.underline} field. And sometimes
rejuvenates it. The force of the transindividual, of all that exceeds
and precedes the individual, does rewild. But its vitality is weakened,
and as perception is honed to single out the individual over the field,
the human increasingly becomes the focal point, becoming synonymous with
life. This is how the logistics of genocide---the genocide of
relation---does its work. [[The genocide of relation can never be traced
back]{.mark}, quite. Relation cannot be propertied. What is lost cannot
be parsed]{.underline}. The yellow eyebrows have a role to play, of
course, and we could call on the archbishop for that missing apology,
but the truth is, it was never just one. He was never just the one. [He
is a logistical pattern, a commitment to the dramaturgy of (white) man
as self-centered orchestrator of existence cleared. Logistics: the slave
ship, but also the body-as-individual. "The first odious vessel produced
by and for logistics is not the slave ship, but the body---flesh
conceptualized---which bears the
individual-in-subjection]{.underline}."12 [In the clearing, man is
revealed as the loss of relation]{.underline}. Humanism is born here, in
the empty space of the stolen land, in the vast expanse of the 1+1, the
infinite regress of nothing-in-between. [[How to fill the
emptiness?]{.mark} How to create an account for all that is lost and yet
claimed? [Mediation offers to fill the shape of the
between]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Mediation as the figure of what comes
between, of what fills that "empty" space]{.underline}. [The
adjuster]{.underline}, the divorce lawyer, the priest, the government
agent. [[A quick intervention]{.mark} to make sense of all that has
become unclear, [to fill in the lines]{.mark}, to provide
context]{.underline}. And perhaps this does make things clearer, perhaps
we understand each other a bit better now that we've mediated all we
couldn't make sense of in the vast emptiness of our difference. But the
problem is: [[mediation never goes away]{.underline}.]{.mark} [It sits
there, inert but active, facilitating the ongoing impoverishment
relation by adhering to all that takes the shape of the 1+1 of
body-as-individual, of interpersonality]{.underline}. Because in advance
of the gesture of inserting the mediating influence, he is already
there. [Long before the divorce, [he]{.mark} [hovers]{.mark}, betweener,
[judging]{.mark}, parsing, condoning, [condemning]{.mark}. His take
doesn't really matter. What matters is that [he remains in the offing,
holding things apart.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Mediation is the father of
the control society]{.mark}. It is the way [surveillance takes on a
personality from the outside]{.mark} in]{.underline}. Whether formally
or informally, [mediation sets the tone for an interpersonality that, by
definition, can only be lived at a distance]{.underline}. Playing at
impartiality, [[mediation haunts the surround]{.mark}, [reducing it to
what is already known]{.mark}, what is already valued, what is already
within the scope of the expressible]{.underline}. 2+1, always less than
3, mediation is passive aggressor, [poised for judgment]{.underline},
always in the know (while it listens carefully). [Because [its role is
to keep existence in its track, on its logistical path]{.mark}. [It
doesn't really matter who is right. It matters that it needs
mediation]{.mark}. Mediation knows best, trampling on any detail of
middling, sewing interactivity into a twoness without
excess]{.underline}. Hardening the between of interpersonality into the
amplification of the self-same, mediation lodges at the interstice,
cutting it into a hyphen, setting up its colony on the bridge. [Settler,
it speaks from a place it has never had to truly encounter because its
role is only to order things apart. Harney and Moten might speak of
mediation with the same disdain as they do of logistics, which they call
the "science of whiteness]{.underline}."13 Mediation is the logistic
category par excellence of whiteness. [It has no content, is not in
itself an agent of transformation, does nothing but cannibalize the life
it parses. Its intervention happens in the beat of enter and retreat,
leaving the uneasy twoness of existence to sort itself out.]{.underline}
In the name of property and propriety, mediation solves all
uncertainties of zoning. That it never actually leaves is its dirty
secret. [But [the logistics of mediation can only
fail]{.mark}.]{.underline} The interface is shaky---we know this both
from the endemic code 404, page not found, and from the impossibility of
truly domesticating our surrounds. [Ultimately, [the]{.mark} squirrels,
the black flies, the birds, the worms, the fungi, the weeds, the
viruses, the [hackers]{.mark} [cannot be kept in their
place]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The disarray is handled, of course, with
more mediation, with more logistics]{.underline}. The interface claims a
distance, a secure between-two that repeats the refrain of nature
colonized, of culture denatured. [It promises a security of
inhabitation, a zone that can be controlled, a slip through which we can
safely enter, we who claim the place. Here, in the logistics of passage
that beats at the cadence of the one-two, me-you, [the outcome is always
the same. Police to subjugate]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Code to
organize]{.underline}. Clear to colonize. [Logistics aims to straighten
us out, untangle us, and open us to its usufruct, its improving use;
such access to us, in its turn, improves the flow line, the straight
line]{.underline}. And what logistics takes to be the shortest distance
between us requires emplotting us as bodies in space where interiority
can be imposed even as the capacity for interiority can be denied, in
the constant measure and regulation of flesh and earth.Scene 5 Deleuze
and Guattari speak of man as the white wall of the black hole of
existence.15 Think landscape painting, especially the kind that excises
that very life that breathed it into existence. If you're not familiar,
search for "Canadian art." And if you don't know the history of the
mansplaining of the Canadian landscape, search for the Group of Seven,
the early twentieth-century Canadian landscape painters, and notice not
only the ubiquity of the vast open, uninhabited space, notice the
clearing. Very little has changed over the last hundred years. We still
see Canada through the clear, in the emptiness of nature cultured. The
denuded land, the empty north, is how we art ourselves still today, we
who property the land. The Group of Seven, those painters of the land
pristine, of the great white north, the painters of the land of the
(single) pine and of the distant ridges, they are still with us, still
managing the imagination, orchestrating the field, playing the
dramaturgy of extinction. Logistics are also aesthetic (if not artful).
The white man is a specter. That is to say, the white man is without
content, without shape. He is the shift in form that allows all
takings-place to be propertied inhabitations, which is to say, sites
already claimed. This is whiteness: the pretense that the lines that
demarcate the boundary between me and you protect you, protect me, from
the wilderness of all that cannot be contained (and must be kept at
bay). The truth is, the wilderness was cleared, but never quite
colonized. And that is why whiteness is alive and well. To police a job
half-done. Scene 6 [[Mediation]{.mark} makes many promises. It promises
clarity: think, drop-down menu. It [promises]{.mark}
[fairness]{.mark}]{.underline}: think, divorce court. It promises
health: think, therapy. The gesture is cast as innocuous. [A simple
third, a neutral agent. A little bit of reason. A moment of
distance.]{.underline} An interlude so that things can be tied up again
and smooth functioning can resume. A representation of the useful.16 But
what is it to insert distance into a field of relation if not violence
of the highest degree? Whose distance? At what cost? To what ends?
Guattari fights against this at every turn, refusing mediation either in
politics or in psychiatry. Schizoanalysis is the proposition, a call for
a transversal operation that breaks the pretense of neutrality in the
encounter. A [therapeutics of transversality. No more triangle. No more
transference.]{.underline} Schizoanalysis is the event of the encounter
itself, the practice of encountering. To be in the relation is to have
been changed by it. What this looked like: a years-long institutional
arrangement housed at a clinic called La Borde in the north of France
whereby to be in the therapeutic encounter was to live with the effects
of encounters in the everyday and to learn from them how to continue to
live. Nothing very complicated, really. But infinitely complex in its
transversality. [Because to live in the encounter, to allow ourselves to
be changed by it, is to be continuously undone, and to be sensitive to
all that comes alive in that undoing]{.underline}. Who we are is a
question that can only really be asked (and answered) by the mediator.
[[The mediator]{.mark}, after all, [looks in from outside to tell us how
our actions are affecting the world]{.mark}]{.underline}. Without the
mediator there is no steady external gaze, no calm interface for the
mirroring. [That's why "who we are" is always a white question, a
question of whiteness, of colonization.]{.underline} Blackness, write
Harney and Moten, is not a thing, or a state (of being). It is the way
the doing expresses. It is not a subject, not a person, not a property.
It is a field. It is the excess on itself of a body claimed, blackened
by hate. Blackness is the celebration of refusing to claim, to be
claimed. "Meanwhile, Michael Brown is like another fall and rise through
man---come and gone, as irruption and rupture, to remind us not that
black lives matter but that black life matters; that the absolute and
undeniable blackness of life matters; that this is not a judgment of
value but a description of a field of activity that obliterates the
worldly distinction between the organic and the inorganic."17 Blackness
is not the simple descriptor of what has been enfleshed. [Blackness
cannot be mediated into a form imposed (exposed). Blackness is the force
of living that exceeds colonization, its accursed share]{.underline}.
And in that sense, the wildness of the surround, it too is black. As is
the earth. This is what Guattari means when he entreats us to move from
schizoanalysis as a therapeutic-political dispositif, an agencement more
than an apparatus, a moving-forth of encounterings afield, toward the
transversality of what he calls the "three ecologies."18 These three
ecologies, the mental/conceptual, the environmental, and the social, are
the overlap, as I see it, of a commitment to a blackening of the earth,
out of the clear. (Necessarily European) man, in and as the exception,
imposes speciation upon himself, in an operation that extracts and
excepts himself from the earth in order to confirm his supposed dominion
over it. And just as the earth must be forcefully speciated to be
possessed, man must forcefully speciate himself in order to enact this
kind of possession. This is to say that racialization is present in the
very idea of dominion over the earth; in the very idea and enactment of
the exception; in the very nuts and bolts of possession-by-improvement.
The world is posed as the way to live on the earth as the individual is
posed as the way to live in the world. To live in the world as an
individual is therefore to be logistic, and to be logistic is to settle
into a rhythm that kills, to beat out that rhythm over the undercommon
track that keeps (giving away) its own measure.19 Scene 7 Guattari wrote
The Three Ecologies in what have come to be known as his winter years.
The winter years came after a sustained attempt at working with the
Green Party in the aftermath of the terrible letdown of post-1968
politics in France. [This attempt to connect to state politics left
Guattari with a sour taste. He knew better, of course, than to trust
state politics to be a site of transformation.]{.underline}
Schizoanalysis had been the wager that there were other ways---that to
work "in common," "toward the common" is, ultimately, always to commit
to the logic of mediation. In The Three Ecologies, [he makes a plea to
[invent new ways of being committed to and involved in the urgent call
to transversalize experience]{.mark}, ways that move beyond how the
state lays claim to existence: In the domain of social ecology there
will be times of struggle in which everyone will feel impelled to decide
on common objectives and to act "like little soldiers," by which I mean
like good activists]{.underline}. [But there will simultaneously be
periods of resingularisation in which individual and collective
subjectivities will take their marbles and go home without a thought for
collective goals, and in which creative expression as such will take
precedence]{.underline}. This new ecosophical logic---and I want to
emphasize this point---resembles the manner in which an artist may be
led to alter his work after the intrusion of some accidental detail, an
event-incident that suddenly makes his initial project bifurcate, making
it drift \[dériver\] far from its previous path, however certain it had
once appeared to be.20 There is an echo in this ecosophic call to Moten
and Harney[: Rather than dissipate our preoccupation with how we live
and breathe, we need to defend our ways in our persistent practice of
them. [It's not about taking the streets; it's about how, and about
what, we take to the streets]{.mark}]{.underline}. What would it be and
what would it mean for us jurisgeneratively to take to the streets, to
live in the streets, to gather together another city right here, right
now?21 Ecosophic logic is a refusal of the clearing, of the ways in
which we seek to inhabit the space already colonized. It recognizes the
lure, and understands the commitment to change that the gesture of
taking the streets embodies. But ecosophic logic asks a different
question: [What if instead we practiced living by creating new
conditions that didn't center us, that didn't inadvertently redeem that
central and self-centering figure of man and its [mediating
logistics]{.mark}? What if we painted into the dérive of artfulness's
angle on experience? What if we moved at the pace of that accidental
detail tangled with the weeds we have been wasting so much time
clearing?]{.underline} [Ecosophic logic is an urgent call to refuse the
ongoing clearing that denies, decries, and [violates the force of
blackness in the ongoing genocide of all that resists]{.mark} the
count]{.underline}. To refuse does not mean to face and challenge.
Frontality, the neurotypical activity par excellence, only cements into
place what is already there, what is already claiming the ground of
existence. To refuse means to move into the accursed share of
life-living twisting in the troubled interstice, to move with that
anarchic share of existence that keeps giving life. For life-living to
thrive, life has to be activated at those interstices that exceed man.
Life's expression as tangle has to be attuned to from the edges in.
Conditions have to be crafted to honor what is not about us. This is
what the First Nations in Barkskins of course already knew. And for this
they were cleared. To see, to feel, what was always already there, to
pulse with a force of life-living that cannot be claimed---owed or
owned---this was always the crime. Scene 8 The many years Guattari spent
practicing schizoanalysis, which is to say, living at La Borde and
encountering, daily, the shape of an existence unmediated, an existence
committed, always, to a refusal of normopathy---these are what he takes
into the project of the three ecologies. And it is specifically the
orientation of La Borde toward neurodiversity, I believe, that makes it
necessary to underscore what he calls the mental, or conceptual, ecology
as the inflecting force that must, and will, change the contours of the
environmental and the social. La Borde taught him this: to skirt the
question of the subject leaves the black hole wide open, filled to the
brim with neurotypicality, whiteness. [In the sickness that has befallen
the earth---the ongoing genocide of all that eludes the
count---[subjectivity, too, has fallen ill]{.mark}. Replaced by the face
of man, given the guise of whiteness in all its logistical powers of
mediation, subjectivity has been swallowed, engulfed by the
subject]{.underline}. ["The main feature of the colonial-capitalistic
unconscious is the reduction of subjectivity to its subject's
experience."]{.underline}22 But subjectivity, as Guattari understands
it, is nothing other than its ongoing production. It is not the subject.
It is the transversal, the emergent unmediated middle, the collectivity
that must never be reduced to the one. This is why, for a renewed
project of the earth, or as Moten and Harney would have it, for the
blackening of the earth---"we are the moving, blackened, blackening
earth"23---"it [will be a question of literally reconstructing the
modalities of 'group-being' \[l'être-en-groupe\], not only through
'communicational' interventions but through existential mutations driven
by the motor of subjectivity]{.underline}."24 To construct modalities
for group-being is a call for an aesthetics of sociality which exceeds
the 1+1 of interpersonality. Group-being, or what Guattari refers to as
the "group subject," is not countable. The group subject is never the
sum of its parts. As solitary as it is multiplicitous, the group subject
makes felt how subjectivity is produced in the excess on itself of
coming into relation. The group subject is how the more-than of the
relational field finds expression. It is the emergent collectivity of an
expression of life-living shared (in its accursed excess), expression
irreducible to the one, always beyond consensus. Without mediation, the
group subject is activated in the renunciation of summing up. To produce
the modalities for this excess of existence requires a mutation on
existence itself, a mutation that in every sense rethinks subjectivity
as a position. The group subject reminds us that what we produce is
never solely ours. We are not simply our-selves. We are fieldings of
complex imbrication. [Any other account of experience is subjected to
mediation, organized by logistics.]{.underline} Anarchival to the core,
the production of subjectivity is not an account of a life contained. It
is not condensable to something like identity. It is not reducible to
the form of the human. It is always more-than, always in movement, a
motor or conduit of a worlding. The production of subjectivity bodies in
the same gesture that it refuses to be a body, an
"individual-in-subjection."25 That is to say: in the production of
subjectivity the bodying is always a being of relation. Always in
movement, it does its living in the unlimited exposure that exceeds any
body-world separation. Subjectivity is not inside. It is not in me. It
is out of me. [Rather than speak of the "subject[," we should perhaps
speak of components of subjectification]{.mark}, each working more or
less on its own. This would lead us, necessarily, [to re-examine the
relation between concepts of the individual and subjectivity]{.mark},
and, above all, to make a clear distinction between the
two]{.underline}. Vectors of subjectification do not necessarily pass
through the individual, which in reality appears to be something like a
"terminal" for processes that involve human groups, socio-economic
ensembles, data-processing machines, etc. Therefore, interiority
establishes itself at the crossroads of multiple components, each
relatively autonomous in relation to the other, and, if need be, in open
conflict.26 "That abolition starts with the self."27 In the drift,
subjectivity's dérive is irreducible to the human. Active in the
interval of worlds making themselves, subjectivity is never reducible to
a subject. The production of subjectivity is the activity of the
interstice: vector, not form. Schizoanalysis works at this uneasy
juncture. The task of schizoanalysis is not to get between body and
world, between-two. Its task is to make way for all that already
populates the between, and to agitate, from within the field of
relation, orientations already in germ. Fostering the germination,
tending the field, schizoanalysis vectors the inflection. The vectoring
requires a subtraction from the open field of all that is still in
potentia. Schizoanalysis culls from potential a shape, a way. This
excision from process is a subtraction from infinitude to the finite.
From the side of infinitude, in the field of immanence, Whitehead calls
this activity that sparks a standing out of experience "importance."
From the side of finitude, in the field of activity, Whitehead calls it
"expression": Expression is founded on the finite occasion. It is the
activity of finitude impressing itself on its environment. Thus it has
its origin in the finite; and it represents the immanence of the finite
in the multitude of its fellows beyond itself. The two together, namely
importance and expression, are witnesses both to the monistic aspect of
the universe and to its pluralistic character. Importance passes from
the world as one to the world as many; whereas, expression is the gift
from the world as many to the world as one.28 Importance and expression
function as intensifiers of experience, bringing into activity the
singularity of a life that nonetheless continues to carry its anarchic
share. [In this account, the human is not singled out. There is no
externalizing voice, no mediator. Arrows of experience are their own
force, importance not a question of what matters to me, but of what
actually]{.underline} (but always also in potentia) makes a difference.
Importance makes way for precision in experience. [That is to say,
importance is what fosters a certain specific angle of existence,
allowing certain qualities of experience to take precedence over others.
We have come to believe that mediation is necessary to parse
experience.]{.underline} But as Whitehead emphasizes, the world is
always in its own pursuit of amplification. Incessant clearing,
colonialism without end, in the afterlife of slavery, results in systems
out of kilter. Ecological destruction has finally begun to register,
centuries too late. The question of how to bring things into a
metastability that is conducive to life-living must involve a reckoning
with the deadening force of mediation. We don't need another apology. We
need to get out of the way. The blackening of the earth requires the
production of something entirely other than me, or you.The infraface29
of the three ecologies---"the world as one to the world as many ... the
world as many to the world as one"---is immediating.30 [[Immediation is
not the opposite of mediation]{.mark}. Rather, [it is the force of a
thirdness irreducible to a between-two]{.mark}. Immediation is the
more-than, the n+1 that is by necessity n-1, one as many, many as one,
[the qualitative force of an uncountability that diagonalizes to give
rise to what else moves in the relation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The
production of subjectivity is immediating]{.mark} to the degree that it
is not produced by something outside itself. [Immediating]{.mark},
always at once body and world, [its own perspective]{.mark}. That is to
say, its angle on existence is not ours, cannot be reduced to us. The
production of subjectivity is a making-conceptual of
existence]{.underline}. It is an attuning to the deadly violence of the
body-world split produced in the wake of the clearing.31 There are not
three ecologies. There is one ecology multiply intertwined. [To get to
the potential of what the three ecologies in their transversality offer,
the production of subjectivity must be attended]{.underline}
[to]{.underline}. [We have failed each other at the juncture of the
production of subjectivity in particular, and nothing will be possible
without that shift]{.underline}. In the words of The Invisible
Committee, the exhaustion of natural resources is probably much less
advanced than the exhaustion of subjective resources, of vital
resources, that is afflicting our contemporaries. If so much
satisfaction is derived from surveying the devastation of the
environment it's largely because this veils the frightening ruin of
subjectivities. Every oil spill, every sterile plain, every species
extinction is an image of our souls in rags, a reflection of our lack of
world, of our intimate impotence to inhabit it.32 To become in excess of
a person, to activate the conditions for a life-living that worlds in
the bodying, is a social and environmental act. [The emergent sociality
of becoming-environmental never happens through the clearing. In happens
in the midst, black flies and all. [The production of
subjectivity]{.mark} in the transversality of the three ecologies is the
way the more-than of nature naturing [crafts a sociality
ecosophicall]{.mark}]{.underline}[y.]{.mark} A sociality, as Harney and
Moten might say, all incomplete. Guattari calls the ecology he
associates with the production of subjectivity "mental." I prefer
conceptual, to produce a stronger sense of how the world itself is alive
with the movement of thought. A turn to Whitehead brings the two
together. For Whitehead, the conceptual share is that excess of
experience that tunes the occasion to its potential. All activity in the
world has a conceptual share, but it is true to say that some aspects of
existence make use of it more emphatically. Whitehead calls this
"mentality." Mentality, as in Guattari, is not reducible to the mind.
Mentality is the force of existence. It is the world's capacity to
exceed itself. All incomplete, the world continuously renews itself.
Scene 10 We don't need to look to some far off lands: it's already here.
Isn't that what Tommy Orange means when he says, "Being Indian has never
been about returning to the land. The land is everywhere or nowhere"?33
The work has already begun. [[The accursed share of life-living]{.mark}
is too unwieldy, too uncountable, to be mediated. It [cannot be
governed]{.mark}. This is its potency, but also its
fallacy.]{.underline} The work is not where we've been taught it is. And
the tools we need are not the ones we own. a nascent subjectivity a
constantly mutating socius an environment in the process of being
reinvented34 The three ecologies are a proposition. They are not a
place. To follow the artist-architects Arakawa and Madeline Gins, we
might call them an architectural procedure.35 An architectural procedure
is not an architecture. [It is a fielding of potential that brings into
constellation enabling constraints for the construction of a
world.]{.underline} Procedurality is key. An architectural procedure
must produce itself propositionally. This means that what emerges will
never be a thing, a site. It will undercommon itself into existence,
perhaps---as Arakawa and Gins once said---"only making an appearance
indirectly."36 [Because to see-feel it is to have created the conditions
for feeling, conditions that were never reducible to a subject as given
in advance]{.underline}. The event of the three ecologies is here, in
the productive looping of a field of experience that is at once
constitutive of its expression and constituted by it. Because when
importance and expression meet, it is never at our bidding.

[Considering Black cultural contexts where mental illness and cognitive
disability occur, the two major Western modes of
interpretation---[ocularity and]{.mark} (drawing on our earlier
conversation) [linear time---no longer retain the exclusive right to
interpret meaning]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[[The Black mad
are,]{.mark} in some sense, [no more]{.mark}. [They becomce the mad
Black]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [I [theorize mad Black and mad Blackness
as a formulation that disrupts]{.underline}]{.mark} [the ocular and
linear legacies of [the West's conception of space and time]{.mark},
respectively]{.underline}. [[To theorize the concept of]{.mark} the mad
Black or [mad Blackness]{.mark} opens up critical space [to
consider]{.mark} how [the discourses of madness and Blackness]{.mark}
not only operate in intraracial spaces but also [intensify and dismantle
common understandings of each other]{.mark}. [When mad becomes a
modifier for Black it carries with it]{.mark} the charge of
[excess]{.mark} (i.e., more Black, really Black, unapologetically Black,
Blackity Black), [anger, and insanity]{.mark} as it simultaneously
functions as an intensifier for Blackness itself. In some ways, madness
amplifies Blackness in this conception, pushing it to excess, but it
also has the potential to dismantle it. Said potential lies precisely in
the disruption of Western space and time]{.underline}. Sight no longer
acts as the dominant mode of sense making. [[Linear progressions of time
no longer]{.mark} capture the movement of subjects and objects through
narrative. Mad Blackness fills in the gaps heretofore created by reading
strategies (]{.underline}i.e., mutual constitution) [that rely on these
two Western modalities of interpretation]{.underline}. For instance,
[Octavia E. Butler's mad Black character cleaves time from space with
her very existence, such that the linear progressive narrative plane is
disrupted. She also foregrounds the lie in thinking of the
impeachability of sight as the dominant mode of
interpretation]{.underline}. Her allies cannot see her illness. Their
understanding based on sight---no matter its superlative quality--- is
impoverished. [[The mad Black]{.mark} then [is not solely disruptive
because of its embodiment]{.mark}. But also, the mad Black figure and
[mad Blackness stage a narratological intervention in how we analyze and
tell stories]{.mark} about race and disability writ large.]{.underline}
**[[Mad Blackness]{.mark} describes the aesthetics of a text that
[refuses to adhere to ocularcentrism or
linearity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In these texts---including but not
limited to the ones in these conversations---madness and Blackness
pervade the structure of the text such that linear renderings of the
narrative always do a disservice to the text and an emphasis on sight
forecloses interpretive possibility. [To be clear, it is not that
ocularcentrism and linearity are wholly inappropriate, but rather that
they are explicitly incomplete due to the influence of madness and
Blackness in the structure and characters of the text]{.underline}. As a
result, **[mad Blackness necessarily critiques texts that de bnigrate
madness or Blackness or both.]{.underline}** Despite, and perhaps owing
to, this disruptive quality[, [I would not define mad Blackness as a
revolutionary force, nor would I expect mad Black figures to offer
solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[Their disruption---of interpretation,
of narrative---does not require that they provide solutions, since that
contrasts their suspicion of linearity and teleology, [nor does it
require that they be benevolent, since that often requires they be in
service of those that create and maintain antiBlack ableist and sanist
structures]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} This book, [Black Madness ::
Mad Blackness, is one such example of a mad Black text]{.underline}. As
I mentioned, [the conversations herein reveal critical conversations to
themselves, and seek to perturb some of the foundations upon which Black
studies and disability studies rest all while yoking them irrevocably
together Nalo Hopkinson's work in Midnight Robber (2000) theorizes this
concept through her two mad Black figures (one who experiences mental
illness and another, cognitive impairment) and her aesthetic commentary
on narrative structure.]{.underline} Midnight Robber is not her only
novel that explores the mad Black. Hopkinson's oeuvre includes a variety
of characters and plotlines influenced by or experiencing some form of
madness peculiar to the worlds they inhabit. In Sister Mine (2013), one
of Hopkinson's main characters has a congenital magic defect. In The
Chaos (2012), the entire world randomly changes so that rules of
physics, metaphysics, climate, thermodynamics, and electricity no longer
apply. Brown Girl in the Ring (1998) features a cadre of characters who
do not share the reality of the community. The New Moon's Arms (2007)
wades into the territory of madness within a subplot about the main
character's origins. [Hopkinson's short stories in Skin Folk (2001),
particularly "Tawny Bitch," which depicts a woman in an asylum, also
feature (and I mean that in the vernacular sense) mad Black characters
and aesthetics.13 **For the characters for whom this is an embodied
reality, madness can be real or imagined. It tends to divide into the
two categories described and parsed above: cognitive disability and
mental illness.**]{.underline} Cognitive impairment within the world of
Hopkinson's novels carries with it a sense of responsibility to the
person experiencing the impairment. [Those who have been perceived as
having mental illness tend to be sequestered or isolated from a larger
community either physically or emotionally. Determining soundness of
mind crystallizes in our logophilic obsession with the book and the
insistence on the unimpeachability of sight]{.underline}. [Here---in
this break]{.underline}---is where Nalo Hopkinson's work becomes
instructive.

### 2AC \-\-- Accountability Good

So, [the [critical task]{.underline}]{.mark} [before us is not to
dismiss mutual constitution but rather [to develop a more robust
analytic that does not remain stagnated between recuperation and
resistance]{.mark}. We must [consider how recuperative projects assume a
simultaneity and reciprocity of creation not always present within
linear history and interracial encounter]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[[We must be wary of projects that locate resistance on Black mad bodies
solely in service of white bodies]{.mark} (regardless of ability
status), avoiding the seduction of ascribing agency at the cost of
ignoring material reality.]{.underline} The critical literature foments
its analysis based on characters or people's relationships to structures
and institutions; yet, within each lurks the possibility of analyzing
another set of relationships, the interpersonal. [Without parsing
structural violence and history from intimacy, Octavia E. Butler's
consideration of kinship and intimate relationships offers a space to
consider the quotidian and erotic praxis that undergirds the
relationships and analytical possibilities of Blackness and
madness.]{.underline} **[[A move to the quotidian and the erotic
prioritizes the import of "the discretionary acts]{.mark} and, yes,
[racist]{.mark} \[and ableist\] [practices that each of us make in
everyday decisions such as choosing someone to sit beside on the subway,
selecting a mate or a sperm donor, or developing a list of subjects or
an academic study."32]{.mark}]{.underline}** [Not only should we rethink
the "autonomy usually attached to erotic choices" but also how "racism
\[and ableism\] orders some of the most intimate practices of everyday
life."33 Obviously, proximity and intimacy offer no curative function
for racism and ableism and can, in point of fact, exacerbate the wounds
they create]{.underline}. Yet, [[the contours of how we discuss intimacy
reverberate beyond the individuals it includes, revealing a limited
threshold for complex interpretation.]{.mark}34 [When we do not excuse
the behavior of allies, friends, family, and sexual partners as
representative of a culture, poor impact of good intention, or part of a
learning curve, they offer another way to think through the
constellation of relationships between Blackness and madness,
circumventing the inclination toward limited readings of either
resistance or recuperation.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In my original plan for this book, I had intended to say much more about
the legacy of vitality politics in Michelle Obama's "Let's Move"
antiobesity campaign, and to unpack its continued practice in Flint,
Michigan's lead-poisoned water crisis. While [I was]{.underline}
completing this book and [meditating on the afterlife of these
historical intersections of slow violence, Black debility, and fugitive
justice,]{.underline} however, [the 2016 presidential election occurred,
and all seemed changed, changed utterly]{.underline}. [I began to
suspect that concluding with]{.underline} [these stories of historical
recurrence may not fully address the questions we need to ask about the
long history of antiblackness and African American debility: what are
the stories worth telling in our current]{.underline}
twenty-first-century [cultural moment]{.underline} and, as importantly,
[what are the questions we need to ask in telling these stories to
intervene and to imagine alternative social, economic, and political
possibilities?]{.underline} During and now after the 2016 election, as
it has been frequently noted, [the United States witnessed a resurgence
of white nationalism]{.underline} [(or at least its unabashed
expression) and intensified antiblackness.]{.underline} But [what
interested me was how the material-semiotic sign of Black debility
functioned as a key relationality within a less overt conservative white
racism,]{.underline} [which reconstituted white citizenship for a
supposedly postrace multicultural America.]{.underline} However, [this
time questions of Black debility had a different valence.]{.underline}
Although, as in an earlier post-Reconstruction period, [Black debility
was once again being invoked as part of a white backlash against racial
progress, it had morphed]{.underline}. [No longer was white America
defining itself against a strategically constituted or permitted Black
debility: it was both reappropriating this positionality as a sign of
its own victimization while reauthenticating a decontextualized maiming
of Black lives as a comparative sign of their inherent and implacable
"noncompliant" debility]{.underline}. [We can see this story of white
America's "rehabilitation" and the utility of Black debility most
clearly in the current narratives about the opioid crisis that has
caused political commentators on the right and the left to question
white America's decline and possible future, and also Black America's
intractability]{.underline}. In the remainder of this epilogue
[I]{.underline} will, therefore, [offer a discursive reading of what I
call "the gentrification of the drug crisis" narrative in public debates
about white America's needed rehabilitation in the face of the opioid
crisis]{.underline} in order [to trace out]{.underline} some final
[thoughts about Black America's structurally necessary debility in U.S.
citizenship-making stories]{.underline}. Then, as a way of demonstrating
how this narrative has entrenched itself in Hollywood's popular
overcoming narratives, I will offer a brief analysis of the 2015 film
Southpaw that, even though seemingly offering a typical sentimentalized
story about cross-racial friendship in the boxing world, reveals the new
logic of a white identity politics that, like the drug crisis itself,
gentrifies a Black positionality and displaces its devaluation of Black
life in order to circulate a dominant narrative about America's "great
(white) hope." Specifically, in the 2015 film Southpaw, which stars Jake
Gyllenhaal and is directed by the African American Antoine Fuqua, we see
how the main character, Billy Hope, referred to as the boxing world's
"great white hope," discloses how a liberal white antiracist narrative
of America's comeback story and contemporary prison reform still depend
on the drug-addicted pain and suffering of an inherently different Black
debility. [During the 2016 presidential campaign there was a lot of talk
about]{.underline} America's---or at least [white rural and suburban
America's---drug epidemic]{.underline}. As the candidates noted, citing
the most recent available statistics, 37,000 Americans died of drug
overdoses in 2013, but what captured headlines, as [Vice News
noted]{.underline}, was the fact [that drug overdoses "killed white
people more than anyone else,]{.underline}"14 or, as the New York Times
reported on February, 2, 2016, "Addiction \[Now\] Has a White Face."15 A
study published in JAMA Psychiatry in July 2014 reported that nearly 90
percent of recent heroin users were white, and about 75 percent of these
new users came from rural or suburban areas, many in states that are GOP
strongholds.16 While campaigning in key primary states such as Iowa and
New Hampshire, as a consequence, traditionally conservative law and
order Republican candidates broke silences and confessed their own
family histories with drug abuse. Jeb Bush shared his daughter's
struggle with addiction and the felony charges she had faced for
"illegally possessing prescription drugs";17 Carly Fiorina admitted her
daughter's struggle with alcohol and opiate addiction before her death
from an overdose; and Ted Cruz disclosed his older half-sister Miriam's
similar overdose death, explaining, "\[t\]hese tragedies are happening
in human lives all over this country---it's the human journey" (emphasis
added). Although not sharing personal family histories, Ohio governor
John Kasich also addressed what he called (repeating the language of
news stories in the New York Times as well as on NPR) the
"gentrification of the drug crisis." In 2014 Governor Kasich had passed
in Ohio the first legislation to make naloxone available without a
prescription because, at the time, the state had the second highest
number of overdose deaths. [I want]{.underline} for a moment [to quote
Governor Kasich's comments before a Drug Addiction Forum in New
Hampshire because they point out the troubling racialization,
structuring antiblack debility and emergent white identity politics
within various survivalist narratives about America's drug epidemic and
the push toward more humane responses, replacing incarceration with
treatment]{.underline}. [Speaking to a largely white audience
in]{.underline} New Hampshire, [a state still 96 percent
white]{.underline}, according to the government census data[, Kasich
noted]{.underline}, "[This disease knows no bounds, knows no
income]{.underline}, knows no neighborhood; it's everywhere. . . . And
[sometimes I wonder how African Americans must have felt when drugs were
awash in their community and nobody watched]{.underline}. [Now it's in
our communities, and now all of a sudden, we've got forums, and God
bless us, but think about the struggles that other people
had]{.underline}\".19 As Kasich's comments attest, drug addiction should
be reframed as a colorblind disease, and five months later, in July
2016, [Congress passed]{.underline} a landmark piece of
[legislation]{.underline} referred to as the Opioid Bill, or more
officially as the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), [that
shifted low-level drug violations from the criminal justice system to
treatment programs.]{.underline} The promotion of such a public health
response represented a significant reframing and overturning of the
nation's response to addiction during the Reagan era "war on drugs," and
we should not minimize the importance of this shift toward
rehabilitation. But [such a therapeutic rethinking of policy also
depends on a new race transcending and seemingly more civilized
disability (or addiction) narrative that taps into a structuring
antiblackness to rehumanize innocent white users, just as Black debility
had functioned to legitimate white labor privileges and
enfranchisement]{.underline} during the post-Reconstruction period. This
["gentrification of the drug crisis narrative,"]{.underline} as we might
call it, [discloses not just a racist disparity]{.underline} [between an
earlier zero tolerance of Black crack users]{.underline} in the 1980s
and 90s [and a contemporary public health response to sympathetic white
heroin users.]{.underline} [It also offers insights more generally into
an emergent dynamic of a Black debility within an unmarked white
identity politics that often comes to stand in for contemporary liberal
antiracist multicultural discourse]{.underline}. [To]{.underline} begin
to [unpack how antiblackness structures the white identity]{.underline}
[politics]{.underline} of this seemingly more civilized "gentrification
of the drug crisis" narrative[, we need only look at the legacy of a
long history of antiblackness and health]{.underline} that I have tried
to recover throughout the previous chapters. As I have argued throughout
this book, drawing on the work of Black Studies scholars such as Jared
Sexton, Frank Wilderson, and Alexander Weheliye, antiblackness
encompasses more than racial bias, discrimination, white privilege, and
even violence. [Antiblackness refers to a foundational structuring
differentiation that continues to govern Black lives in the afterlife of
slavery.]{.underline} Not only, thus, have [white supremacists invoked
antiblackness as a self-identifying racial difference, but U.S. liberal
notions of personhood, citizenship, and agency have also depended on
figurations of antiblackness, or of Black disposability and
worthlessness and indifference to Black suffering and pain as a
structuring force.]{.underline} In his comments before the Drug
Addiction Forum, [Kasich]{.underline}, on one hand, [calls for empathy,
but he also invokes the larger shaping logic of a post--civil rights
white liberal identity politics]{.underline} ([one that goes unmarked as
"color-blind]{.underline}" amid the alarm over a more clearly vocal
white supremacism): [this white identity politics depends on, to borrow
the language of the drug epidemic narratives, a white gentrification and
appropriation of a Black positionality in the call for a universalizing
empathy]{.underline}.20 As Kasich's comments before the drug forum's
white audience note, whites are the new Blacks, for whites now share the
suffering and pain historically associated with an abstracted Black
experience, and as a consequence, the United Stated can now move beyond
identity politics to embrace, as Ted Cruz indicated, a universal "human
story." But [this supposed postrace, postidentity politics is its own
white identity politics, one that although seemingly antiracist (built
as it is around a common pain of addiction), obscures the structuring
position of a differential Black debility.]{.underline}

### 2AC \-\-- Root Cause 

#### We control root cause- ableism and antiblackness are foundational to the creation of gender hierarchies and capital accumulation. Their analytic can only explain one form of violence while our 1AC takes a more wholistic approach against anti-black and ableist histories.

The second critical impulse, [retrieval projects that read against
ableism to find agency, attempts to locate spaces of resistance where
race and disability meet.]{.underline} Here again, I turn to the
critical conversations to read where the distillate reveals the material
to itself. [[An analysis of resistance]{.mark} surfaces as part of
projects undertaking Bell's "representational detective work" that
"[uncovers the misrepresentations of Black, disabled bodies]{.mark} and
the missed opportunities to think about how those bodies transform(ed)
systems and culture."]{.underline}19 As such, it offers a way to think
through the cultural and political contours of structural ableism as
intersected with structural racism. So far, [this scholarship concludes
that [Black disabled bodies loosen the grip of ableism by resisting
cultural norms]{.mark} of both disabled and Black communities: [scholars
explore this dynamic within Blackness and madness]{.mark} from a wide
variety of critical angles, [including Black women and
depression]{.mark} (Anna Mollow), [melancholia and povert]{.mark}y (Éva
Tettenborn, Anne Cheng, Paul Gilroy), [cognitive disability and civil
rights redress]{.mark} (Stacie McCormick), [rehabilitation and Black
queerness]{.mark} (Robert McRuer), [and popular music]{.mark} (Nicole
Fleetwood, La Marr Jurelle Bruce, Moya Bailey, Anna
Hinton).]{.underline} Usefully, this body of scholarship opens up the
critical space left closed when we aver that discourses of Blackness and
madness compete. [Each points out that the workings of structural racism
and ableism do not complement each other.]{.underline} In fact, the
cultural logics that mandate Blackness as abject can depose those that
maintain disability as such. This strategy is not the only or primary
way to read challenges to racism and ableism. [[The problem
exists]{.mark} (pace Hortense Spillers) [at the level of
grammar]{.mark}. These projects tend to have one vector: they
"transform(ed) systems and culture."20 Note that [transform operates as
transitive where Black, disabled bodies perform the work of
transformation]{.mark} rather than undergo the process of
transformation.]{.underline} Yet Black, disabled bodies will not always
behave as agents that transform or those who are transformed in equal
measure or, as noted above, with a degree of reciprocity. [Allowing for
more than one vector between Black, disabled bodies and the systems in
which they operate clarifies the following: it is inaccurate that the
only critical relationship between Blackness and disability
(specifically, madness) is one of liberation from ableism.]{.underline}
At times, **[[Blackness exacerbates]{.mark} the presence of
[ableism]{.mark}, or cultural norms facilitate ableism.]{.underline}**21
In accounting for these moments, [I trouble the corollary of the logic
above: namely, that whiteness withal the privilege embedded in it lacks
the tools for its own liberation and must rely on Blackness to acquire
its release.]{.underline} Here[, [Blackness becomes a]{.mark} reduced
[space where whiteness enacts]{.mark} its [privilege by
instrumentalizing Blackness]{.mark}. In this paradigm,
[Blackness]{.mark} for all its cultural complexity [becomes another
reactionary space that exists to indict whiteness,]{.mark} rather than a
culture and system of thought all its own.22]{.underline} [We must
consider the spaces when mere exposure of oppression is not only not
emancipatory but can also be detrimental, where demonstration and
acknowledgement of one's various intersecting socially marginalized
positions does not equal political agency.]{.underline} **[[We]{.mark}
must also [consider what happens when Black cultural locations refuse
whiteness]{.mark} as an interlocutor in favor of intraracial
conversations. In short, [when madness is "a Black thang"]{.mark} (with
all that evokes in terms of exclusivity and ableist
objectification).]{.underline}** I take up the question of intraracial
context and conversation in the next discussion. For now, [I turn to
another foundational moment in the study of Blackness and disability to
read in the breaks of the critical material. I continue the conversation
about the critical impulse of mutual constitution that looks to retrieve
agentive stories of Black disabled folks as instantiations of
anti-ableist radicality.]{.underline} Rosemarie Garland Thomson's
Extraordinary Bodies (1997) includes a chapter on physical disability in
Ann Petry's The Street, Toni Morrison's oeuvre, and Audre Lorde's Zami.
[Though Thomson's discussion does not explicitly discuss mental
disability, cognitive impairment, or crazy-as-insult, I find it
instructive for this conversation. Madness shadows each of the texts
under scrutiny since the characters deviate from intracultural norms by
being Black women who seek class ascension despite the odds (Petry) and
wider American cultural norms by participating in and identifying with
communities labeled deviant (and crazy) by the dsm IV
(Lorde).]{.underline} Of course, Morrison's characters are literally
haunted by their actions and kinfolk, which always forces the question
of whether Morrison's characters could be labeled crazy. It becomes
useful to think about Morrison's, Petry's, and Lorde's work (especially
as part of Garland Thomson's project) from the perspective of Octavia E.
Butler: namely, that sanity is communally defined and anyone who
deviates from agreed upon norms is treated as mad. [T[he characters'
desires for themselves]{.underline}]{.mark} [(and the methods they use
to achieve them) [exceed]{.mark} the [racialized and gendered
boundaries]{.mark} drawn for them. Indeed, because they also have
physical disabilities, their behavior trespasses the boundaries drawn
based on ability as well.]{.underline} [[Madness cannot be cleaved from
these conversations]{.mark}. Thomson's claims about the representation
of physical disability as agentive and liberatory have implications for
whether madness has similar representational
possibilities.23]{.underline} Thomson offers that the collective project
of these Black women's writings provides an antidote to white racist
depictions. [[These powerful bodies]{.mark}--- extraordinary, in
Thomson's lexicon---[participate in a "collective project of cultural
revision \[that\] challenges the African-American woman]{.mark} writer
[to produce a narrative]{.mark} of self [that authenticates Black
women's oppressive history]{.mark} yet offers a model for transcending
that history's limitations."24]{.underline} Moreover, the primacy given
to disabled women figures "reveals the shift in African-American
literary representation from a modernist to a postmodernist mode, a
change that parallels the ideological move of minority groups from
assimilation to affirmation of cultural and ethnic differences."25
[While I partly agree that these representations "render oppression
without reinscribing it,"26 I hesitate to read in them the triumph that
Thomson affirms.]{.underline} On the one hand, Thomson rightly points
out that these characters do not completely represent physical deviance.
On the other, they do not, as she says, "repudiate such cultural master
narratives as normalcy, wholeness, and the feminine ideal."27 [I would
attribute this aspect of their representation to the way that the social
model of disability upon which Thomson relies does not fully account for
the way madness shows up in these texts.28 [The social model privileges
a particular kind of mental agility and cognitive processing to combat
the stigma and material consequences that arise as a result of
ableism]{.mark}.]{.underline} In turn, [the model dismisses madness as a
viable subject position, ensuring that those counted as such---either by
communal consensus or psydisciplines---remain excluded from
conversations about disability because they cannot logically
engage.]{.underline} For the characters in Thomson's study, [this has
the pernicious effect of erasing some of the master cultural narratives
they work against: those that acknowledge their physical disability and
link it to mental disability as a way to further disenfranchise and
disempower them.]{.underline} Thomson's work reads these figures (based
on their representation of physical disabilities) as liberatory for the
larger narrative and theoretical spaces of ethnic modernism. [I hazard
that these characters' relationship to disability suggests an investment
in internalized ableism, particularly visà-vis sexuality.]{.underline}
For example, Thomson reads Ann Petry's Mrs. Hedges, a tall, dark-skinned
Black woman with avoirdupois who works as a madam, as one who refuses
victimization. [Important for this conversation is the way Mrs. Hedges
is not only physically disfigured by burns but also read as ex ceeding
the gendered and racialized boundaries the text's Black community
(voiced through the protagonist) circumscribes for her. Her madness is
not biomedically defined, but it carries psychosocial repercussions
given how she is treated.]{.underline} Thomson bases her reading of Mrs.
Hedges as liberatory on Hedges's sexualized gaze on the main character
and her profession as a madam. Yet, there is no room for Hedges to
acquiesce to or enjoy the sexualized attention she receives from the
rich white man who controls the street. The novel makes it clear that
part of Hedges's rejection of the man's sexual advances is financial.
She cannot be in bed with him literally and economically. However,
**[what the novel leaves open is that Hedges's rejection of him is also
about her own denigrated view of her sexuality.29 She is still limned as
monstrous, grotesque, even if Hedges as a figure shifts the
understanding of monstrosity.]{.underline}** Inasmuch as Hedges's
physical disability allows her to move from one position in the economy
to another more powerful one, she must rely on a chosen life of celibacy
and a masculinized, monstrous appearance to secure and maintain her new
economic position. [Her celibacy also shores up her power by keeping the
madness of her disfigured, disabled, interracial sexuality in
check.]{.underline} That is, [though the disability is no longer in the
background of the text, [the cultural baggage of internalized ableism
appears in the foreground replete with eschewing sexual desire and
limiting the association with traditional forms of
femininity]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even if Petry's project
does---according to Thomson---pave the way for Black authors to shift
from assimilation to affirmation and provide a challenge to the static
representations of disabled figures in modernist texts, Mrs. Hedges's
refusal to engage in her own sexuality complicates a reading of this
figure as liberatory vis-à-vis physical disability and the charges of
madness that accompany her character. Reading Mrs. Hedges as agentive
certainly poses challenges given the internalized ableism within Petry's
text, especially since the novel focuses on intraracial encounter.
First, physical disability only liberates Mrs. Hedges from the
intraracial economy of the street by providing an avenue for power. Yet,
[within intraracial encounter, she remains circumscribed by the
discourses of madness because community members consider her mad for
transgressing boundaries of race and gender]{.underline}. Second, [the
interracial encounter does not allow for her agency within the critical
literature. Thomson claims that Petry's text, as well as the others,
counters the limited representations of disability within modernist
texts]{.underline}. Implicitly, the logic of such a critical
move---regardless of its truism---mandates that Blackness become the
vehicle for (mostly white) others' liberation from ableism in their
reading practice. In that way, **[[it is the presence of Blackness that
shores up white liberalism by not only providing a representation of
Blackness but also a complex rendering of white-centered notions of
disability.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

In Butler's drafts of Fledgling, she toys with the way Shori's Black
madness structures her interactions with the Gordons and the text writ
large. Each instantiation of the novel evinces Butler's commitment to
depicting Blackness and madness as destabilizing forces, which heighten
and problematize privilege because they shift the contours of the
multiability, interracial encounter. [The two discourses work together
and, in that sense, remain coextensive, but they also function at
cross-purposes]{.underline}. For instance, Shori speculates that the
Gordons test her when they allow her to question the human agents
responsible for the arson that killed her family.[In Butler's drafts,
she experiments with how to split the questioning between Shori and the
Gordons, and, in the final version, Butler settles on Shori's silence.
In the published version of Fledgling, [Shori is only present to
reassure the human agent and persuade him to tell the
truth.46]{.mark}]{.underline} The effect of these changes---displacing
the Gordons as the primary interrogators---suggests that the difference
is not merely about the space given to the Gordons but rather how
Blackness and madness operate. [In one draft, [Shori interrogates the
human agent.]{.mark} Here, [her Blackness functions as a discomfiting
presence for the human,]{.mark} a reminder and remainder of her
difference that forces him to reveal the identity of the Ina
agents.]{.underline} Making her the interrogator does not disappear her
madness, but it does emphasize a soundness of mind that does not appear
to be consonant with her understanding of being Ina, undermining her
general authority over her amnesiac experience. In another draft, [the
Gordons serve as the primary interrogators. Here, her Blackness performs
a similar discomfiting function. Her amnesia bolsters her authority over
her own experience, even as it forms the basis for her being surveyed by
the Gordons.]{.underline} Her madness, invisibilized though it may be,
structures the interaction since the Gordons' familiarity with other Ina
allows them to ask leading questions of the human agent. By virtue of
her amnesia, this s not an interrogation skill she can use. [As a
result, her silence in the face of her amnesia lingers as an answer to
the Gordons' skepticism about her, creating two
interrogations]{.underline}. [In these drafts, splitting the questions
between Shori and the Gordons reorganizes how and why information about
the attacks is given, clarifying that Shori's Blackness and madness work
on the interaction differently than the Gordons' whiteness and presumed
sanity.]{.underline} In the final version of Fledgling, since she is
largely silent, Shori's **[Black madness functions as a sustained
pressure for the interrogation, emphasizing the Gordons' privilege in
relation to her.]{.underline}** [Whereas [her Blackness shores up her
utility during the questioning, her madness strips away her authority
and autonomy]{.mark} because the Gordons take over the interrogation of
the human agent and, without saying a word about her amnesia, create an
interrogation of her.]{.underline} Though her race is recognized in both
the draft and the final copy as a boon to helping them catch and coerce
the human agents, the difference in interrogation technique allows for
her madness to reveal the Gordons' relationship to privilege. [Recall
[that thinking about Blackness and madness as mutually constituted leads
us toward reading the two identities as an avenue toward agency]{.mark}
when they are located on the same body.]{.underline} I objected to this
line of thought because it requires that Blackness operate as a stepping
stone for imagining agency only available under certain material
conditions and assumes that mere knowledge of one's condition suffices
as emancipatory. [Butler's novel and archive theorizes about this in
contemplating the interplay of desire and madness. Butler writes several
drafts of an interaction between Shori and Daniel Gordon where Daniel,
lost in his own desire for Shori, invites her to bite him.47 In each
draft, the invitation remains unspoken at first, functioning only as a
matter of scent. He allows her to crawl all over him while they smell
each other.]{.underline} The olfactory plays a large part in Ina
attraction to either possible symbionts or other Ina. [So, Daniel's
invitation to smell---especially since he has to keep himself from
acting on sexual arousal caused by her scent---is dangerously
coercive.]{.underline} [It suggests sexual agency for Shori, but in fact
it jeopardizes her life. Butler writes what appears in the final
version: Daniel's admission that he had hoped Shori's memory was
impaired enough to let her bite him. He says, "I half-hoped you would
\[bite\], that maybe with your memory gone, you would simply give in to
my scent, my nearness.]{.underline} If you had, well . . . If you had,
no one could prevent our union. No one would even try."48 [What [keeps
her from such an action is her understanding that it might threaten her
good standing at the Council of Judgment]{.mark}.]{.underline} In these
scenes, Daniel remains silent at first and, later, forthcoming about his
desires/intentions. His invitation is a test, one Shori must pass to
prove her Ina-ness to other council members, a perception of her
identity dependent on both her race and her impairment. **[[This
is]{.mark} not merely [about]{.mark} Daniel's desire but rather
[how]{.mark} his [desire manifests as a form of ability that takes
advantage of]{.mark} Shori's [impairment and bears repercussions for the
perception of her identity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Operating along the
axis of desire, [Daniel's craving of Shori microaggresses her by
circumscribing her within parameters that facilitate her erasure.
Microaggressions as a series of environmental, verbal, and nonverbal
slights often fall into the category of unintended discrimination and
often occur in intimate and/or interpersonal spaces.]{.underline} At
times, this discrimination also comes from an affective space of
benevolence, where one intends to be nice but instead reveals one's own
biases, ignorance, and desires. To read a microaggression, to understand
it, is to analyze the break in the everyday since those moments prove
revelatory about the microaggressor. [Daniel intends to demonstrate
desire and create intimacy, become Shori's Ina lover, and concretize
what he views as the eventual mating between their
families.]{.underline} However, Shori is not old enough in Ina society
or physiologically mature enough to mate, and her impairment renders her
ignorant of social customs regarding interaction between Ina males and
females. In addition, [Daniel has made a decision about his desire to
mate with Shori, whereas Shori's ability to make such a decision must
be---by virtue of her circumstances--- delayed. Note the issue of
time.]{.underline} Despite her enjoyment of Daniel's scent, [[Shori does
not control the marketplace of desire, making murky the possibility of
consent]{.mark}. Daniel's solicitation encourages her to break the rules
and flirts with disaster given that they are on the cusp of a Council of
Judgment meant to decide her fate.]{.underline}

### 2AC \-\-- Fatness (Mollow) 

#### The stigma that fatness inherently equals disability allows the media to perpetuate that fat, black people fall victim to the violence that they experience is due to a fault of their own and not the oppressive systems built against them

**Mollow 17** (Anna Mollow, Doctor of Philosophy in English in the
Graduate Division of the University of California, Berkeley
(2017). *Unvictimizable: Toward a Fat Black Disability Studies. African
American Review, 50(2), 105--061.* doi:10.1353/afa.2017.0016)

Those who defended Garner's killers added another source of blame to an
already familiar mix: Garner was fat. According to the New York
Republican congressman Peter King, the chokehold was necessary because
Garner was a "350- pound person who was resisting arrest." Furthermore,
King asserted, if Garner "had not had asthma and a heart condition and
was\[n't\] so obese, almost definitely he would not have died" (qtd. In
Henderson). Here, [[fatphobia and ableism function as weapons of
antiblack violence]{.underline}]{.mark}, allowing Garner to be blamed
for his own death at the hands of police. In this essay, I argue that
[fatphobia is routinely deployed in ways that exacerbate the problem of
state-sanctioned violence against African Americans]{.underline}. As we
shall see[, [antifat prejudice, racism, and ableism intersect to create
a double bind in which black people are depicted as
unvictimizable]{.mark} for two contradictory reasons: black
people]{.underline}---of all sizes, but fat black people in
particular---[are figured as innately disabled but also as invulnerable
to disability, injury, or suffering]{.underline}. For example, defenders
of the officers who killed Garner reproduced stereotypes of black bodies
as inherently disabled when they insisted that fatness-induced
disabilities---rather than a deadly police chokehold---caused Garner's
death. At the same time, Garner was portrayed as almost superhumanly
invulnerable when Congressman King described him as a "350-pound person
who was resisting arrest," the implication being that Garner's size made
him so dangerous that deadly force was necessary to defuse the threat
that he presented. In this and other tragic incidents that I discuss in
this essay, fatphobia and ableism work in conjunction with racism to
construct an ideological double bind that rhetorically positions black
bodies as incapable of being victimized. [[One side of this double bind
renders violence against black people inconsequential by suggesting that
fatness is the real cause of any injuries inflicted upon them, while its
other side depicts violence as a necessary response to the excessive
physical power that black people, especially those who are fat, are
imagined to embody.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[This racialized double bind is not]{.mark} a [new]{.mark}
invention.]{.underline} In the U.S., [[it dates back to the era of
slavery]{.mark}, when slave owners and their supporters contended that
black people were so prone to physical and mental disabilities that they
could not survive without the "protection" of their white
owners]{.underline}---[while at the same time maintaining that people of
African descent possessed such inordinate strength that they did not
suffer from the abuses that their enslavers imposed upon
them]{.underline}.2 Today, discussions about race are less likely to
explicitly invoke biological theories equating blackness with
disability. [[More common is a discursive formation that some scholars
call the "new racism," which blames the social disadvantages that black
people experience]{.underline}]{.mark} 105 African American Review 50.2
(Summer 2017): 105-121 © 2017 Saint Louis University and Johns Hopkins
University Press [[not on biological impairments but instead on alleged
moral failings, such as "laziness" and lack of "personal
responsibility"]{.underline}]{.mark} (Collins).3 What is important is
that the [[new racism has not replaced the old racism]{.mark};
[instead]{.mark}, it [repackages longstanding racist stereotypes to make
them more palatable in a neoliberal, ostensibly "postracial"
era]{.mark}]{.underline} (Collins 32-33). [[Fatphobia]{.mark}
[functions]{.mark} efficiently [as a weapon of the new racism by
enabling the adaptation of old ideas about black people's supposed
inborn physical deficiencies to a modern context]{.mark}, attributing
the putative bodily pathology of "obesity" to moral shortcomings that
are coded in racialized terms. Tellingly, the behaviors to which fatness
is commonly attributed replicate stereotypes of black people as
undisciplined and unable to control their appetites]{.underline}
(Williams-Forson).

[[A central justification for stigmatizing fat people rests on two
unexamined assumptions: that fatness is a choice, and that it typically
leads to disability]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Because fatness and
disability are inseparably linked in the cultural imagination, it is
impossible to adequately theorize antifat oppression without
simultaneously attending to ableism]{.underline}. Nor, I will argue, can
antiblack violence be sufficiently analyzed without examining the ways
in which ableism and fatphobia reinforce longstanding constructions of
black bodies as unvictimizable. [We therefore need a methodology that
takes measure of deeply imbricated relationships among racism, ableism,
and fatphobia]{.underline}. Because no such theoretical apparatus
currently exists, this essay begins conceptualizing a new,
transdisciplinary methodology, which I provisionally term "fat black
disability studies." [Fat black disability studies brings together four
principal bodies of work: critical race theory, fat studies, disability
studies, and the Black Lives Matter movement]{.underline}. While the
present essay focuses on racialized state violence, this by no means
exhausts the topics that fat black disability studies could illuminate.
As I articulate my argument about the roles of fatphobia and ableism in
sustaining antiblack state violence, I also sketch the contours of fat
black disability studies, highlighting key insights within the multiple
disciplines that compose it: critical race theory's concept of
intersectionality, fat studies' contestation of the medicalization of
fatness, disability studies' analyses of social constructions of
"health," and Black Lives Matter's demonstration of the ways in which
police brutality is fueled by other, often unrecognized, forms of
antiblack violence.

#### Environmental racism that black neighborhoods enforces the idea that fat people are disabled and ignores the fact that the location the neighborhoods are in subjects the residents to toxins that create health issues

**Mollow 17** (Anna Mollow, Doctor of Philosophy in English in the
Graduate Division of the University of California, Berkeley

American Review, 50(2), 115-116.* doi:10.1353/afa.2017.0016)

[Failures to punish perpetrators of antiblack violence send the
disturbing message that black lives do not matter to the
state]{.underline}. [Much the same message is conveyed by the U.S.
government's long standing refusal to adequately address the lead
poisoning crisis in African American neighborhoods. Although the use of
lead paint was banned decades ago, the paint remains on the walls of
many low-income black people's homes, and laws stipulating that
landlords inspect rental housing for lead paint are seldom
enforced]{.underline} (Wheeler and Broadwater). In Gray's home state of
Maryland, almost five thousand children, the vast majority of whom are
African American, have experienced lead poisoning in the past decade
(Wheeler and Broadwater). Lead poisoning is only one of many examples of
racialized environmental injustice. Historically and contemporarily[,
[black neighborhoods have been used as dumping grounds for toxins that
white people have the political and economic clout to keep out of their
communities.]{.underline}]{.mark} People of color are far more likely
than whites to have little choice but to live near landfills, hazardous
waste facilities, coal-fired plants, and chemical factories; they also
face disproportionate levels of water contamination and pollution (Bell;
Covert). Here, Black Lives Matter's reference to the ways in which
[[black people]{.underline} ["are intentionally left powerless at the
hands of the state" is germane:]{.underline}]{.mark} despite the
pervasiveness of racialized environmental injustice, the Environmental
Protection Agency has never made a formal finding of a civil rights
violation against people of color ("Did the EPA\'\'; Covert). Since its
effects on the bodies of people of color are damaging and sometimes
deadly, environmental racism as a form of violence. [Yet [fatphobia
masks this violence]{.mark}: while news about a supposed ["obesity
crisis" makes daily headlines, the press all but ignores environmental
racism]{.mark}. This omission is particularly troubling when one
considers that food activists who blame fast food restaurants and snack
foods for illnesses and disabilities focus intense attention on the
poorest African American neighborhoods, where the effect of
environmental racism the most extreme.]{.underline} What if the public
resources that are now being used to fight a "war on obesity" in
communities of color were instead directed to the task of eliminating
environmental racism? [One of many toxins to which [people of color are
disproportionately exposed is nitrogen dioxide, a chemical that has been
identified as a potential causative agent in asthma and heart
disease]{.mark}]{.underline} (Swift). As previously noted, Eric Garner
had both of these conditions, and defenders of the police who killed him
blamed his death on these disabilities, alleging that they were the
result of fatness. Their comments crystallized the ways in which
[[antifat prejudice, racialized police brutality, and environmental
racism interlock and reinforce each other]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[While
fatness has not been shown to cause asthma, heart disease, or any other
medical condition, the pollution that proliferates in African American
neighborhoods likely does increase the risk of acquiring these
disabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus, the inaccurate claims about
body size and health that were circulated by those who blamed Garner for
his own death had effect not only of legitimizing anti black state
violence but also of obscuring the violence of environmental racism.
Like police brutality, [[environmental racism is often justified through
dehumanizing rhetoric that depicts black people as unvictimizable,
suggesting that the injuries black people sustain are of their own
doing]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the mid-twentieth century, when
scientific evidence implicating lead paint in neurological and cognitive
disabilities became overwhelming, the lead industry claimed that lead
poisoning resulted from "uneducable Negro and Puerto Rican families" who
could not stop their children from eating paint (Black).33 [Note the
striking similarities to contemporary discourses about body size: much
as proponents of lead paint maintained that black people would not get
sick if they would only stop putting the wrong things in their mouths,
modern-day medical "experts" blame health problems in African American
communities on "obesity" and portray black people as lacking the
requisite "education" to make appropriate choices about what to
eat.]{.underline}

#### Black, disabled people are forced into a double bind that, especially when they are fat, images them as unvictimizable. This ideology gives an excuse for the state to enact violence and disguise it as them protecting civilians from "dangerous people"

**Mollow 17** (Anna Mollow, Doctor of Philosophy in English in the
Graduate Division of the University of California, Berkeley
(2017). *Unvictimizable: Toward a Fat Black Disability Studies. African
American Review, 50(2), 115-116.* doi:10.1353/afa.2017.0016)

[[Fatphobia reinforces]{.mark} these [tropes of black bodies as
inherently dangerous]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider, for example, public
remarks by Steve Loomis, the president of Cleveland's police union, who
defended Loehmann's decision to shoot Tamir: Tamir Rice is in the wrong.
He's menacing. He's 5-feet-7, 191 pounds. He wasn't that little kid
you're seeing in pictures. He's a 12-year-old in an adult body. Tamir
looks to his left and sees a police car. He puts his gun in his
waistband. Those people---ninety-nine percent of the time those people
run away from us. (Schultz) In keeping with the new racism, Loomis never
mentions that Tamir is black. Yet it would be difficult to miss the
unspoken racism that saturates his words. The repetition of the phrase
"those people," the denial of Tamir's vulnerability, and the description
of an unarmed preteen boy as "menacing" call up longstanding images of
black bodies as too dangerously powerful ever to be considered victims.
Interestingly, although Loomis knows better than to speak directly about
Tamir's race, he does offer detailed information about his size.
Immediately after describing Tamir as "menacing," Loomis gives his exact
height and weight. Why must the public know that Tamir was precisely
"191 pounds"? Presumably, it was Tamir's weight, not his height, that
one was supposed to take as evidence that he was "wrong"; since five
feet, seven inches is shorter than the average American man, Loomis's
mention of Tamir's height serves no discernible purpose other than to
make it clear that Tamir was fat. [Functioning as a proxy for racism,
fatphobia]{.underline} enables Loomis to reduce the child victim of a
police killing to a [set of dehumanizing antiblack stereotypes, yet
without ever directly mentioning race.]{.underline} [[Antifat prejudice
shores up cultural conceptions of black children as lacking
innocence,]{.mark}]{.underline} authorizing Loehmann's assertion that
Tamir was a "12-year-old in an adult body." [[A fat black child, it
seems, cannot really be a child.]{.underline}]{.mark} Nor, it seems, can
an African American person of any age be perceived as a genuine victim
of state-sanctioned violence[. [In a culture that relentlessly depicts
black bodies as unvictimizable, dominant cultural representations of
blackness impede recognition of suffering, injury, and loss experienced
by African Americans.]{.mark} As we have seen, [this erasure is effected
in part through an ideological double bind that contradictorily images
black people as inherently disabled but also as invulnerable to pain,
disability, and suffering]{.mark}]{.underline}. We have also seen that
antifat prejudice augments this double bind: from depictions of Tamir
Rice as "menacing" to insinuations that Barbara Dawson posed a threat to
other patients in the hospital from which she was evicted, [[one side of
this double bind represents black bodies as dangerous. The other
side,]{.mark} which [suggests that it is fatness and not violence that
causes injuries and deaths of fat African Americans]{.mark}, relies on
inaccurate assertions]{.underline} such as the claims that Eric Garner's
"diet killed him" and that Barbara Dawson died because she was
"overweight." As I have demonstrated, [[this double bind has lethal
consequences in a wide range of institutional contexts, including the
healthcare system, policing, and environmental
policy]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 2AC \-\-- Scholarship Good 

#### Challenging the current norms surrounding disability in modern literature allows for the stigma surrounding disability to be dissolved so it can be seen in a better light

[[The defamiliarization of race, gender, and sexuality in black women's
speculative fiction is important because it demonstrates that
(dis)ability is not an exceptional category in these texts and is
therefore not merely metaphoric or symbolic.]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[Instead, (dis)ability represents an integral part of the collective
defamiliarization of multiple social categories of privilege and
oppression,]{.mark} which encourages readers to imagine each of them
differently. The [defamiliarization of (dis)ability, race, gender, and
sexuality encourages us to question our assumptions about the
definitions, meanings, and boundaries of these
categories.]{.mark}]{.underline} Not all speculative fiction, however,
works to explore and question social systems of privilege and
oppression. [As feminist and critical race scholars of speculative
fiction have demonstrated, [some texts reify social categories and their
related stereotypes]{.mark}]{.underline}, even in nonhuman contexts.
This is most apparent in representations of the racialized Other through
the figure of the alien, robot, or cyborg.14 It is important then that
these contemporary black women writers challenge readers to think about
the social construction of (dis)ability, race, gender, and sexuality
through defamiliarization. [[This]{.mark} creative destabilization and
[challenging of the norms and stereotypes of multiple social categories
is influenced by black feminist theory,]{.mark} which insists on the
intersectional and mutually constitutive nature of social categories and
oppressions]{.underline}. Defamiliarization in these texts also
demonstrate Barbara Christian's argument that creative texts can be a
form of theorizing about world. While authors do not need to identify
their political positions or personal identities in order for critics to
interpret the political implications of their texts, it is nonetheless
useful to note that Hopkinson has explicitly identified as both feminist
and queer, while Jemisin's blog certainly suggests strong antiracist,
feminist politics (Batty 189; N. Johnston 204). While politicized
creative work is clearly not exclusive to black women, Madison's,
Jemisin's, and Hopkinson's defamiliarization of major social categories
are examples of black feminist theorizing through speculative fiction.
All three authors, in different ways, refuse certain expectations of
(dis)ability, race, gender, and sexuality while still prioritizing those
who are multiply marginalized. These texts therefore provide new and
creative ways for readers to question such social categories, not only
within these fantastical worlds, but also in their own realist contexts.

### 2AC \-\-- Realism 

#### Western rationality frames disability as [incompatible]{.underline} with the "reality" of its logics, excusing the worst [structural violences]{.underline} while focusing on the "opaque\" image of the disabled

Elizabeth J White **Vidarte 21** \[Disability, Dependency, and the Mind:
Representations of Care-Giving and Receiving,. Temple
University ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2021. 28542354,

The AMA's code of ethics did more than prescribe obedience for patients
and tender deportment for doctors; it emphasized the intimately personal
connection between a doctor and the ethics of his practice: "A Physician
should not only be ever ready to obey the calls of the sick, but his
mind ought also to be imbued with the greatness of his mission, and the
responsibility he habitually incurs in its discharge. Those obligations
are the more deep and enduring, because there is no tribunal other than
his own conscience, to adjudge penalties for carelessness or neglect"
(np, emphasis mine).

The weight of this ethical charge lies heavily on Dr. Trescott, the
protagonist of Stephen Crane's61 1892 novella, The Monster. The novella
frames the medical conundrum at the heart of the story as a question of
morality. [Dr. [Trescott]{.mark}]{.underline} has
[[saved]{.underline}]{.mark} the life of [[his black
servant]{.underline}]{.mark}, Henry, [[badly burned]{.underline}]{.mark}
after having attempted to save Trescott's own son from a fire. Yet
[**[Henry is left "without a face"]{.mark}** and apparently]{.underline}
with [little mind; [he has become "the monster]{.mark}]{.underline}." In
the eyes of the town, Henry has transformed into a gothic horror trope,
terrorizing children and the infantilized black residents of the town;
the second half of the novella shows "the monster" repeating scenes from
the first half --- asking the doctor about his horses, walking through
town, and courting his fiancée at her mother's house, though this time
he is met with screams and stones instead of affectionate ridicule, in
part because Henry "the monster" shows no awareness of his
transformation. Eventually a mob forms to demand his removal from their
collective sight, and when the doctor refuses to send him to the state
hospital, he and his wife are socially ostracized. The town's venerated
judge had himself suggested, when Henry was in limbo between life and
death, that the most ethical decision Trescott could make was to let
Henry die.

Ultimately, the novella asks readers to decide whose way of knowing
Henry hews closest to a true understanding of his condition --- and
therefore whose judgement is morally sound. In doing so, readers are
prompted to [[ask]{.mark} where [the limits of morality lie. Is the
judge immoral for suggesting]{.mark} that [Henry would be better off
dead or are]{.mark} the [townspeople immoral for]{.mark} [their
small-minded fear and disgust?]{.mark}]{.underline} Is the doctor
immoral for centering the choice to save Henry on his personal feelings
rather than his patient's best interest? Is this a story about social
prejudice or a story about a doctor's hubris?

Susan Schweik has argued persuasively, in "Disability Politics and
American Literary History: Some Suggestions," that [**[The Monster
is]{.mark} a story of [aftermath]{.mark}**, of what happens **[in the
wake of the unthinkable]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The townspeople, no less
than most [**[critics, cannot]{.mark}** seem to **[conceive of a world
in which]{.mark}** the Henry of the story's after]{.underline} --- that
is, **[[the monster]{.mark} [--- exists as part of the social
fabric]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the small town, no matter how
picturesque its mischievous small boys and gay outdoor concerts, its
barbershop and its tea parties, its volunteer fire companies and its
kitchen gossip. If the intimacies of a small town cannot embrace Henry,
the novella seemingly implies, **[[there is no place for him anywhere in
the universe of American realism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That there were
real, historical Henry Johnsons in the America of the 1890s, Schweik
argues --- [Civil War veterans, face cancer patients, factory accident
victims,]{.underline} those with [congenital harelips, etc]{.underline}.
--- [changes little]{.underline}, for [even in the realm of "history,"
there existed institutions]{.underline} --- [**[overfilled]{.mark}**
state **[hospitals]{.mark}**, traveling **[freak shows]{.mark}** that
specialized in medical oddities, and formal and informal urban "**[ugly
laws" that jailed the disabled for begging in
public]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- that all served a similar purpose: to
remove from public view (unless contained appropriately in the cages and
stages of the circus) and public consciousness, if not public
imagination, those whose very existence was inconceivable in the context
of life and community.

This is where reading with attention to [[the gothic can reveal the
hybrid]{.mark} --- even monstrous --- [generic
structure]{.mark}]{.underline} of Crane's novella; we can see the ways
that Crane's realist and gothic modes are inextricably imbricated such
that "[the real horrors of social relations are simultaneously exposed
and concealed]{.underline}," as Nick Lolordo insightfully argues in his
essay, "Possessed by the Gothic" (36). Beyond this, we can attend to
what the text works hard to disguise through the narrator's exaggerated
irony, along with Crane's exuberant literary style, full of
distractingly improbable similes and figurative expressions to describe
even the most mundane of acts,62 and **[[the cartoonish parodies of
black minstrelsy, immigrant dialect, and the follies of womanly gossip
and jilted spinsters]{.underline}]{.mark}** (all of which are jarringly
contrasted with the seriousness with which the novella takes Trescott's
dilemma). [**[Through the medical gaze]{.mark}** that constitutes Henry
as a knowable monster, the narrator exteriorizes Henry both before and
after the fire through the eyes of the town's characters and, crucially,
also through the narrative itself, such that we are presented with what
Lolordo calls **[Henry's "absolute opacity]{.mark}"
(**]{.underline}Lolordo 47). Attending to what the narrative paints as
the irreducible knowability --- emptied of all subjectivity and
interiority --- of Henry as a black minstrel figure and as "the
monster," we can also interrogate the comforting notion that such an
objectifying view of disability is entirely of the past.

#### Let's schizz this shit up! The process of schizzing is a commitment to the quality of sociality toward alter-economic postcapitalist futures. We'll term this schizoeconomics. The schizz cuts subjectivity as we know it liberating the neurodiverse from the grips of capitalism.

[Schizoanalysis is an alter-economic practice: its work is to unmoor the
financialization of the individual as metric of preexisting
value]{.underline}. [The schizz cuts through the middle, neurodiverse in
its call for the more-than. "[No]{.mark} [more]{.mark}
[normopaths]{.mark}]{.underline}!" it howls. How-else-with-and? [[The
schizz]{.mark} of the schizoanalytic practice [must never be
reindividualized]{.mark} by setting up the figure of the lone
schizophrenic, or any figure, as its cipher.]{.underline} Contrary to
some interpretations of Anti-Oedipus, nowhere do Gilles Deleuze and
Félix Guattari idealize psychosis or schizophrenia. [As everywhere in
their philosophy, [the aim is not to moralize but to couple the
pragmatic with the speculative, asking how processes unfold]{.mark} and
what immanent valuations run through them.]{.underline} The
differentiation they make between schizophrenia as process and
schizophrenia as entity is vital in this regard. The schizophrenic
entity "can only be defined in relation to the arrests, the
continuations in the void, or the finalist illusions that repression
imposes on the process itself" (Deleuze and Guattari 1983, 379). [The
schizophrenic process, or what they call the schizoid pole, refers to
the manner in which [desire invests itself in
sociality]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the schizoid pole, knowledge
schizophrenizes, passing beyond its own axiomatics, creating new
operations. "[[Figureschizzes" are produced "that are no longer either
figurative or structured"]{.underline}]{.mark} (371). [These two
operations, [the schizophrenic entity and the schizophrenic process, are
in continuous co-composition]{.mark}, the schizoid pole always also in
proximity with the threat of the pathological.]{.underline} Desire
schizzes, uncoupling pathology Cephalopod Dreams Finance at the Limit 8
290 Chapter 8 from process. [[Desire]{.mark}, the impersonal force that
activates socialities in germ, [is the revolutionary activity through
which new lifeways are produced,]{.mark} schizzing all the
while]{.underline}. What distinguishes the schizophrenic from the
neurotic is psychosis. What is of interest to Deleuze and Guattari is
that psychosis cannot be oedipalized. The neurotic is the one on whom
the Oedipal imprints take, whereas the psychotic is the one incapable of
being oedipalized, even and especially by psychoanalysis[. [The first
task of the revolutionary . . . is to learn from the psychotic how to
shake off the Oedipal yoke]{.mark} [and the effects of power]{.mark}, in
order [to initiate a radical politics]{.mark} of desire freed from all
beliefs]{.underline}. [Such apolitics dissolves the mystifications of
power through the kindling, on all levels, of anti-oedipal forces---[the
schizz]{.mark}es-flows-forces that escape coding, [scramble the
codes]{.mark}, and flee in all directions]{.underline}: orphans (no
daddymommy-me), atheists (no beliefs), and nomads (no habits, no
territories). (Mark Seem, in Deleuze and Guattari 1983, xxi) [The schizz
must always be considered in terms of what it can do, not in terms of
what it defines.]{.underline} It is from this vantage point that the
figure of the schizophrenic must be understood in the account of
capitalism and schizophrenia, with Oedipus always as the overdetermining
pull to the neurotic replaying, in all pathologies, of what holds them
to the narration of a preexisting structure. Oedipus should not be
considered an actual formation, however. The Oedipus complex is a
tendency in potentia: "it must be actualized in a neurotic formation as
a derived effect of the actual factor" (Deleuze and Guattari 1983, 129).
Psychosis schizzes Oedipus. This is why Freud disliked schizophrenics:
"For we must not delude ourselves: Freud doesn't like schizophrenics. He
doesn't like their resistance to being oedipalized, and tends to treat
them more or less as animals. They mistake words for things, he says.
They are apathetic, narcissistic, cut off from reality, incapable of
achieving transference; they resemble philosophers--- 'an undesirable
resemblance'" (Deleuze and Guattari 1983, 23).1 [In schizzing the
"neurotic territoriality of Oedipus," psychosis produces new
circuits]{.underline} (136). [There is no promise attached to these
circuits. They could just as well fold back on themselves, returning to
all the forms of neuroticization that reduce psychotics to the
apparently unmoored, disjointed paranoid figure psychiatric institutions
lock up]{.underline}. "Perhaps there is only one illness, neurosis, the
Oedipal decay against which all the pathogenic interruptions of the
process should be measured" (319). In pushing up against what can be
extracted from the schizophrenic experience that resists the
neuroticization imposed on it, Deleuze and Guattari pursue the question
that most troubled Jean Oury and was central to the work at Cephalopod
Dreams 291 the La Borde clinic: "[How does one avoid the institution's
re-forming an asylum structure, or constituting perverse and reformist
artificial societies, or residual paternalistic or mothering pseudo
families?]{.underline}" (319). What techniques can be put in place to
schizz the institution's penchant for all that retriangulates? [Urgently
necessary is the decoupling of experience from the pathological
valuations of the deficit model.]{.underline} As in the wider field of
neurodiversity, [[the aim is not cure but a commitment to the singular
ways difference expresses itself and the qualities of desire, knowledge,
and creation it produce]{.mark}s]{.underline}. "A true politics of
psychiatry, or antipsychiatry, would consist therefore in the following
praxis: (1) [[undoing]{.mark} all [the reterritorializations that
transform madness into mental illness]{.mark}]{.underline}; (2)
[[liberating]{.mark} the schizoid movement of deterritorialization in
all the flows, in such a way that this characteristic can no longer
qualify a particular residue as a flow of [madness]{.mark}, but affects
just as well the flows of labor and desire, of production, knowledge,
and creation in their most profound tendency]{.underline}" (Deleuze and
Guattari 1983, 321). Against normopathy, schizoanalysis never does its
work from outside the event. Sensitive to the schizz, it moves with it,
following its tendencies. "[Foucault announced an age when [madness
would disappear]{.mark}, not because it would be lodged within the
controlled space of mental illness ('great tepid aquariums'), but on the
contrary [because the exterior limit designated by madness would be
overcome by means of other flows escaping control]{.mark} on all sides,
and carrying us along]{.underline}" (321). From this vantage point,
schizophrenia shifts from entity to force, desiringproduction its motor.
"Like love: there is no specifically schizophrenic phenomenon or entity;
schizophrenia is the universe of productive and reproductive
desiring-machines" (5[). There is no longer "a specific, identifiable
schizophrenic entity"]{.underline} (6). [What there is instead is a
practice of the [schizz]{.mark} that [attunes to]{.mark} the
[multiplicity]{.mark} of "I, Antonin Artaud, am my son, my father, my
mother, and myself"]{.underline} (15). [Multiplicity in differential,
the schizoid pole explodes the great tepid aquariums of our pathological
imaginations]{.underline}. Beyond pathology, there are no criteria. "It
might be said that the schizophrenic passes from one code to the other,
that he deliberately scrambles all the codes, by quickly shifting from
one to another, according to the questions asked him, never giving the
same explanation from one day to the next, never invoking the same
genealogy, never recording the same event in the same way" (15). [Is
this [madness]{.mark}? Or [is]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [psychosis]{.mark} to
be [found in the imposed adherence of systems on worlds too
differential]{.mark}, too multiple to tame]{.underline}? [The
schizophrenic is the limit case of existence that troubles our
certainties as regards the stability of subjectivity]{.underline}. To
repeat the mantra that drives chapter 5: "A schizoanalysis
schizophrenizes in order to break the holds of power and 292 Chapter 8
institute research into a new collective subjectivity and a
revolutionary healing of mankind. For we are sick, so sick, of our
selves!" (Mark Seem, in Deleuze and Guattari 1983, xxi).2
[[Schizoanalysis is not a practice of the individual]{.mark}. It is [not
a practice of pathologization]{.mark}, of singling out the one whose
neurology will invariably be considered a deficit. Schizoanalysis is a
practice of the event where I, even schizo-I, is not yet. That the
schizophrenic refutes the limited envelope of the individual is
certainly part of the story. But the work of schizoanalysis is not done
on the body (of the schizophrenic) per se. The work is done in the
relation where the phonic leaves its resonant traces]{.underline}. [[The
schizz]{.mark}, the effect of the schizophrenizing of experience, [cuts
subjectivity]{.mark} as we know it, subjectivity [as the claim to the
human]{.mark} ([the category that excludes the neurodiverse]{.mark}, and
all qualities and forces of life-yet-tobe-invented that threaten the I
as white, colonial, neurotypical being]{.underline}. [Capitalism breaks
bodies, its devaluation of qualitative difference at the level of
aesthetic sociality so complete that bodies barely hold up.]{.underline}
Exhaustion, anxiety, depression, and all their offshoots are everywhere
palpable. [Capitalism breeds paranoia, the ground so uneven, our
bearings so unsteady, that we fold into a selfpossession that leaves no
room for what exceeds]{.underline} [us]{.underline}. Limited by the
hardening of our edges, we become more enclosed in our-selves, less
turned to an outside that would revivify the more-than that courses
through us. This is what Deleuze and Guattari are referring to when they
talk about how [[capitalism produces the neurotic]{.mark}, and, at the
extreme, the "sick schizo]{.underline}" (1983, 362[). A [schizoeconomics
is committed to the schizzing of capitalism]{.mark}. Its challenge is to
work in careful attunement to capital's own infinite appetite for
circulation and deviation]{.underline}.3 [Flows, processes, detours are,
after all, what capital is made of, its movements faster, more mad, and
often more creative than we would like to admit.]{.underline} [To
compose with capital is to coincide with its movements to schizz the
more-than that runs through them, connecting to the speculative share of
its own decidedly more-than human process.]{.underline} The cutting edge
of capitalism is in the financial markets, which have evolved forms of
abstract capital so abstruse, contingent, and objectively undecidable
that it is impossible to get an effective grip on them. They run
according to their own process, and sometimes run away with themselves,
periodically crashing and burning. The financialized economy is beyond
the human pale: beyond full human comprehension and beyond effective
Cephalopod Dreams 293 human control. It is a self-driving machine,
operating more and more abstractly, with no one in particular at the
steering wheel. It was created by the human, but not in its own image,
emerging rather as a monstrous offspring that turns back to engulf its
maker and drive away with it. (Massumi 2017c, 9) [To schizz capitalism
is [to develop an account of quality that can]{.mark} discern the
difference between cuts that breed the count of assets, and cuts that
r[evalue value]{.mark}]{.underline}. In its infinite capacity for
deviation, capital is a powerful adversary. The aim of finance at the
limit is always alter-capitalist, but it in no way purports that there
is an outside of capital as we know it. [To schizz capital is to watch
another limb begin to grow elsewhere. [Alter-capitalist futures will be
built]{.mark} of more than the schizzing of capital: they will be led
[by the development of practices that exert the force of other ways of
living]{.mark} in a logic that refuses the tenets that undergird
capitalism]{.underline}---the relentless drive to quantitative increase,
inexorable growth and inequality, the capture of life intensities for
profit. Practicing the schizz begins there, in the midst, [asking what
kinds of techniques can be crafted for those other logics, logics that
sidle, in approximation of proximity, an aesthetic sociality of
blackness, [experimenting with the minor that runs through a sociality
born in the being of relation]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is to say that
the practice of the schizz is never structural, never aimed at a
totality, as though something as stable as capital-as-structure existed
and could directly be taken down. [The practice is transversal,
operating in the circulation of flows themselves. This modest aim may
seem useless. Indeed, it is: an ethos of the pragmatics of the useless
runs through it. It claims nothing as regards grand schemes of
productivity. Its proposition: [to practice the art of life-living at
the differential of minor socialities]{.mark} in a livingloving that
angles toward the instauration of new modes of]{.underline} (merest)
[existence]{.underline}. Schizoeconomies will not come into themselves
once and for all. They will always need to be (re)invented, at every
turn bringing with themselves new techniques for practice unlimited.
Capital is crossed by lines of escape, and this is what finance at the
limit exploits. "Capitalism is continually cutting off the circulation
of flows, breaking them and deferring the break, but these same flows
are continually overflowing, and intersecting one another according to
schizzes that turn against capitalism and slash into it" (Deleuze and
Guattari 1983, 376). [Cleaving capitalism from within, [the schizz
produces]{.mark} social fields that may operate only for an instant, but
nonetheless provoke the seeding of a dif­ferent mode of investment, and
with it [dif­ferent operations of value]{.mark}.]{.underline} Paranoia
will always be around the corner, counting its coins, but as Saidiya
Hartman's Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments 294 Chapter 8
demonstrates, [minor practices of the art of life-living have always
existed, even under the worst conditions]{.underline}: "The wild idea
that animates this book is that young black women were radical thinkers
who tirelessly imagined other ways to live and never failed to consider
how the world might be otherwise" (2019, xv). "The revolutionary
investment of desire" schizzes worlds into otherwise-living (Deleuze and
Guattari 1983, 378). [[Desiring-production is the force against which
capitalism has no power]{.mark}: unquantifiable, in a logic of the
relation of nonrelation, desire as force too impersonal to claim bends
the pathways toward intensities [for which no preexisting code]{.mark},
no count, [exists]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is why the schizophrenic as
conceptual persona is vital to the project of schizzing capital for
Deleuze and Guattari: the schizoid pole is the pole of
desiring-production and, as such, "is revolutionary, in the very sense
that the paranoiac method is reactionary and fascist; and it is not
these psychiatric categories, freed of all familialism, that will allow
us to understand the politico-economic determinations, but exactly the
opposite" (1983, 379--80). [Revolutionary desire is a practice, not a
tool. [It does its work transversally]{.mark}, moving waywardly where we
might least expect]{.underline} it. Writing of Mattie, a young
laundress, Hartman culls from the anarchival force of the photographs
that nourish her critical fabulation the force of what desire can do in
the face of racial capital's devaluations: Mattie has been credited with
nothing, deemed unfit for every role except servility, condemned in
advance of wrongdoing, and destined to be a minor figure even in her own
verified history. To esteem her acts, to regard rather than vilify
Mattie's restive longing, is to embrace the anarchy---the complete
program of disorder, the abiding desire to change the world, the tumult,
upheaval, open rebellion---attributed to wayward girls. It is to attend
to other forms of social life, which cannot be reduced to transgression
or to nothing at all, and which emerge in the world marked by negation,
but exceed it. (2019, 62) [Mobilizing the schizz, inventing
schizoanalytic techniques for practices of the event, requires diligence
as regards capital's (de)valuation of existence. Techniques must be
invented to learn to attune to the difference between finance unlimited
(neoliberal capital) and finance at the limit (schizoeconomy), to become
sensitized to what sanctions the extreme deterritorialization of capital
on one end of the spectrum and empowers the infrathin registering of the
ineffable on the other.]{.underline} Deleuze and Guattari speak of
capitalism's process of production as unleashing "an awesome
schizophrenic accumulation of energy or charge against which it brings
all its vast powers of repression to bear, but which nonetheless contin-
Cephalopod Dreams 295 ues to act as capitalism's limit" (1983, 34).
Capitalism is a movement that skirts the limit, continuously coming up
against the dangers of crossing the threshold: "it continually seeks to
avoid reaching its limit while simultaneously tending toward that limit"
(34). This is even more clearly the case today than when Deleuze and
Guattari underscored it in the late 1960s. Neoliberal capital is the
flow of all flows. As Brian Massumi writes: "The 'capitalist process' is
how the capitalist system dips into its own immanent outside to draw out
new potentials for its becoming, or continuing self-constitution" (2018,
11). [How to invent platforms for schizoeconomic finance at the limit
that do not simply facilitate capital's seemingly infinite capacity to
capitalize on process for monetary gain? Precapitalist marginal
economies may give us a clue. For their operations, unlike those of
capital, are rich with emergent sociality. The notion of the penultimate
is vital to understanding how limit and threshold are mobilized to
engender the being of relation in these early economies]{.underline}.
"Take two abstract groups, one of which (A) gives seeds and receives
axes, while the other (B) does the opposite. What is the collective
evaluation of the objects based on? It is based on the idea of the last
objects received, or rather receivable, on each side" (Deleuze and
Guattari 1987, 437). The receivability of the objects in the account
above refers not to the last object received but to "the penultimate,
the next to the last, in other words, the last one before the apparent
exchange loses its appeal for the exchangers, or forces them to modify
their respective assemblages, to enter another assemblage" (437). The
seriality refers to the cycle the exchange produces. "The last as the
object of a collective evaluation determines the value of the entire
series. It marks the exact point at which the assemblage must reproduce
itself, begin a new operation period or a new cycle, lodge itself on
another territory, and beyond which the assemblage could not continue as
such. This is indeed a next-to-the-last, a penultimate, since it comes
before the ultimate" (438). The ultimate changes the assemblage and,
with that change, produces a new series. The limit is here understood as
"marking a necessary rebeginning," while the threshold marks "an
inevitable change" (438). "What counts is the existence of a spontaneous
marginal criteria and marginalist evaluation determining the value of
the entire series" (438). In the marginal economy, exchange creates the
conditions for an encounter that, each time anew, establishes an
emergent valuation. "There is neither exchange value nor use value but
rather an evaluation of the last by both parties (a calculation of the
risk involved in crossing the limit), an anticipation-evaluation that
takes into account the ritual character as well as the utilitarian, the
serial character as well as the exchangist" (439). [The immanent limit
sets the stage for "a collective feeling out" that cannot be done in
advance of the event (439). Both sides are altered not]{.underline} 296
Chapter 8 [only by the actual exchange but by their collective retuning
to the limit. What has been "exchanged" is more than an object. A
sociality has been invented that accompanies the object, supplementing
it with the allure of the event through which it came to
value]{.underline}. [[The economic cannot be reduced to the exchange
itself. It is a platform for relation]{.mark} that facilitates a process
of collective feeling-out that intuitively responds to the intensifying
approach of the penultimate]{.underline}. [Deviations in the process
will cause punctual redirection]{.underline}, but an immanent
choreography is in place to assist the process in not tipping into a new
assemblage. [[The potency of the penultimate is the sociality it carries
through the syste]{.underline}m]{.mark}. Consider an argument between a
couple. No matter how angry they are, the couple will argue with a
collective feeling-out of a limit, intuitively aware that to cross the
limit might very well untether the bonds that hold the relationship
together. The argument might sidle that limit, but the couple will be
careful not to allow the threshold to be breached. They will do this by
holding back certain thoughts, by attuning to the texture not only of
what is said but how it is said, listening for what might crack their
collective carapace, exposing them to what they cannot bear to hear. If
they do cross that limit, everything will be up for renegotiation, and
their relationship might end. [The penultimate is of course never
precisely knowable in advance---it is best known in retrospect from the
perspective of the ultimate (after the assemblage has tipped into a new
one). Attending to the penultimate means being sensitive to the field of
relation in composition. Holding the process to the internal texture of
its schizz is a way of attuning to the quality of a limit, collectively
composing the relation in relation]{.underline}. When the schizz does
the work of attending to the penultimate, what it does is value the
pulse of duration's serial rhythm as minor sociality. An exchange
happens but it is not here that the value is located. The value is
operative in the collective feeling-out that attends to the event's
composition. This can look like nothing. It can look like a simple
exchange between seeds and axes. But it's much more than that: [it is
the staying-with of the complexity of a seriality lived not as a
transaction but as a proposition for life-living itself. [Practicing the
schizz toward alter-economic postcapitalist futures is a commitment to
the quality of sociality]{.mark}]{.underline} highlighted in Deleuze and
Guattari's account of marginalist economies and sidelined by
contemporary capitalism's way of tending toward the limit. For capital
too, as mentioned above, flirts with the limit, pulling back before it
goes over the threshold. The difference is that capitalism remakes
itself through quantification, in the generation of profit. What is
being collectively affirmed in the marginalist economies is a mode of
existence. When there is a pull back from the limit, it reflects a
collective desire to remain within a field of relation. In capitalism at
the limit, quantification runs wild. Cephalopod Dreams 297 When there is
a push to the limit, the qualitative stakes are masked by the
quantitative drive. This has devastating effects whose runoffs create a
deviation of limit conditions that become capital's new field of
creative potential, the limits reset within the bounds of its own
domain. This can be seen in the cyclic crises through which capitalism
lurches, catching itself each time before it tips over (up to now).

Disability Critical Race Theory (**[[DisCrit]{.mark}) [is a tool
that]{.mark},]{.underline}** if implemented**[[, can give voice to Black
children with disabilities in a system that cares little about
either.]{.mark} [It]{.mark}]{.underline}**s merger of disability studies
(DS) and Critical Race Theory (CRT), if applied, **[[would provide the
necessary shock to the system to racist policymakers who would rather
pity]{.underline}]{.mark}**, at best, [**[than support]{.underline}**
**[the empowerment of visible Black disabled
bodies.]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[DisCrit]{.mark} "[calls
for]{.mark}]{.underline}** activism and **[[resistance that 'removes the
policing and enforcement of normality' rooted in ableism and
racism]{.underline}]{.mark}**\[...\] (Park et al., 2021, p. 59)
**[[DisCrit is a fight]{.underline}]{.mark}** for ownership of the Black
bodies, minds, and aspirations of an underserved population as partners
rather than clients/beneficiaries of the kindness **[[of a
white-controlled system that has not interrogated its own bias and
hatred of Blackness in all its forms.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Through it,
a holiday, **[[passage of disability laws]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
lack enforcement, **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** other **[[feel-good
measures]{.underline}]{.mark}** would **[[no
longer]{.underline}]{.mark}** be **[[the extent of meaningful
change.]{.underline}]{.mark}** DisCrit is the most effective tool to
center the study of power in the hands of the oppressed. In particular,
it offers a kinetic response to injustice within the sector, focusing on
the education of Black students with special needs. **[[Its
interrogation of a system]{.mark} [that devalues the]{.mark} very
[humanity of the subject]{.mark} [provides]{.mark} arguably [the most
comprehensive reading of the oppressor, forcefully turning the gaze of
whiteness on black back onto itself where its systems rather than the
Black body become what must be analyzed and acted
upon.]{.mark}]{.underline}** To examine the utility of DisCrit in the
American classroom, one must first define **[[the critical barrier to
realizing a truly inclusive experience in]{.mark} that [space -- white
supremacy.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In the popular American imagination,
the term conjures images of villainous white men spewing hate and
threatening or carrying out violence akin to the antagonists in Norman
Jewison's film In the Heat of the Night or Alan Parker's Mississippi
Burning. If only it were that simple. As celebrated as these two motion
pictures are, the reality is far more complex and nuanced. **[[White
supremacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** is less about a white individual's raw
hatred of people of color and their unshakeable belief in that group's
inferiority. It is systemic. It **[[seeps into every crevice of the
American project.]{.mark} [White supremacy is]{.mark}]{.underline}** at
times easy to see, but it is **[[invisible to the average
American]{.underline}]{.mark}**---it being so much a part of the
country's history and mission. A highly effective
explanation/definition/navigation of white supremacy is offered by Vann
R. Newkirk II who references critical race theorists while cutting to
the heart of the term: The school of critical race theory, championed by
scholars such as bell hooks, has been around in academic circles for at
least 30 years, and its definition of white supremacy has long animated
black activism. To quote scholar Frances Lee Ansley (taken here from a
passage from David Gillborn, also, a critical-race-theory scholar):
**[[By "white supremacy" I do not mean to allude only to the
self-conscious racism of white supremacist hate groups. I refer instead
to a political, economic and cultural system in which whites
overwhelmingly control power and material resources, conscious and
unconscious ideas of white superiority and entitlement are widespread,
and relations of white dominance and non-white subordination are daily
reenacted across a broad array of institutions and social
settings]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Newkirk II, 2017). For most
African-Americans, a white person not liking them has minimal impact on
their lived experience. But being shut out of educational opportunities,
the professions, healthcare, housing, freedom of movement, and all
manner of fundamental rights is far more than a trivial vexation. **[[It
reduces their quality of life or may even result in their
death.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This all-encompassing aspect of white
supremacy would require surgical excision to separate it from the
history of the American project. It is so embedded in the mission and
purpose of America that white people seldom realize that they benefit
from it. **[Is there a difference between a well-meaning, progressive
white teacher in an urban school system serving Black students and a
card-carrying member of the Ku Klux Klan or activist in the alt-right
movement? Sure, there is. But do they both exist in the same system that
provides them privilege while reducing people of color to second-class
status? There's no doubt that this is also true.]{.underline}** Not
being conscious of the impact of white supremacy on themselves and those
around them makes them both unhelpful at best and at worst equally
dangerous to African-American youth's life and life chances. This
article will interrogate, in an admittedly modest fashion, the history
of white supremacy that has led to a need for an intersectional tool,
not just a theory, but a tool to counter the American education system's
desire to control Black, disabled children, no different than it has any
other category of Blackness in America. It will focus on how **[[DisCrit
can function as an education and awareness tool for educators, parents,
and children who view formal spaces of learning as necessary for the
liberation of people of African descent rather than an institution to
isolate and imprison both the minds and bodies of disabled children in
service of white supremacy.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It will engage a
brief history, leaning more on recent events, current definitions,
explore the limits of disability law without implementation, and the
steps necessary to reform special education as applied to Black people
in America. DisCrit Interrogates the American Desire to Control Black
Bodies From the political violence that led to the murder of Crispus
Attucks before the American revolution, the mutilation of Emmet Till,
and the forced sterilization of Black women in the South, until this
moment[, **[the destruction of Black bodies has catalyzed opening
democratic space in America.]{.underline}**]{.mark} The filmed torture
and murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis resulted in the most
significant moment of collective reflection on the evils of white
supremacy since the end of the American civil rights movement. Floyd was
incapacitated, lost control of his bodily functions, cried for help, and
was exterminated as the world watched. Americans observed in both
fascination and disgust as the full power of systemic anti-Black racism
was captured so visibly that even conservatives were temporarily aghast
at its horror. What would usually go no further than a hashtag on social
media became a moment for corporate philanthropy, study circles on race,
and even a national holiday marking the end of America's original
sin---the enslavement and forced labor of African people in the
formation of America itself. Shortly after this rare moment of
handholding and togetherness, the political and social space transformed
into yet another battle in America's culture wars. Legislative attacks
against Critical Race Theory (CRT) were launched only days after
celebrating the nation's supposed reckoning on race (Sawo & Banerjee,
2021). The quick pivot from compassion and a need to understand each
other across racial lines turned to self-serving claims by numerous
state and national legislative bodies that enough had been done to
placate African-Americans. Nothing more was needed[. **[The current
legislative position in numerous American statehouses calls for
progressive disability advocates and]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, more
importantly, [those with disabilities themselves to forcefully approach
and engage struggle in an intersectional manner that challenges systems
rather than individuals and institutions. America was built on the backs
of Black bodies. The fierce pushback required for Black people to be
seen and heard in America necessitates]{.mark}, as it always has, [the
inclusion of its children]{.mark}, including those [with
disabilities.]{.mark} Black children within special education classrooms
are no less feared than George Floyd was by the police officer who
murdered him. The resistance to subjugation that [DisCrit offers is
informed by the historical legislative, scholastic, and criminal
justice-backed aims to control Black bodies.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### The C/I usage of DisCrit is a necessary resistance strategy to modes of education that are unaware of racial bias.

The Need for Systemic Overhaul Hancock et al. (2021) describe
**[[DisCrit resistance in]{.underline}]{.mark}** childhood
**[[education]{.underline}]{.mark}** as an exercise that transforms
theory into praxis. It **[[moves]{.underline}]{.mark}** with
**[[an]{.mark} [awareness]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline}** educator
**[[bias and racism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, is an asset rather than
deficit-focused, dismisses whiteness as a default entry point for
learning, **[[embraces resistance by]{.underline}]{.mark}** parents and
**[[students]{.mark} [as an opportunity to reflect on systemic white
supremacy]{.mark},]{.underline}** rather than a marker for punitive
action. Respect for the value of the student must be reflected in
curriculum, pedagogy, and solidarity with the community of learners and
parents that are purportedly the focus of special education efforts (p.
49). The above is not an exercise that is workshopped into an educator
after they are hired. It is something that, at minimum, begins during
teacher education. It assumes that what has been absorbed by the
educator before this engagement is a product of white supremacy. It
matters not whether the teacher is a woman of color or even a person
with disabilities herself. One can be taught to hate themselves and, at
times, are more kinetic in disciplinary measures against members of
their self-identified group than someone from outside of it**[[. In a
system that identifies a Black student with disabilities as a liability
or, worse, a threat, it takes a mighty indoctrination process to view
anyone with a Black body as a decision maker rather than a body to be
acted upon. American policy of all types sees Blackness as
threatening---all forms of Blackness.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Khalil
Muhammad (2011) zeroes in on this reality by positing that **[[the fear
of Blackness defines the American cityscape itself.]{.mark} [Urban
America is defined]{.mark}]{.underline}** not
**[[by]{.underline}]{.mark}** greater access to education, commercial
space, advancement in technology, employment, or any other factor.
Instead, **[[the presence of Black people and their association with
crime frame the value of the American city.]{.underline}]{.mark}** With
rapid de-industrialization and re-segregation of many of these spaces on
the one hand and equally aggressive gentrification on the other, the
American city is on some level fighting against itself whether it is
rising or falling, based almost exclusively on the number of Black
people within it. Therefore, among the blackest, legitimate spaces where
progress should occur, the American school system is deemed worthy only
by how prevalent (or not) Blackness is within it. **[[Community
resistance to pity and fear is an essential aspect of
DisCrit.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Studies show that parental involvement
in their children's education is vital in a program for young people
with special needs. DisCrit sees resistance to racism as capital rather
than a deterrent to education. Monique Matute-Chavarria (2021) defines
cultural community wealth as consisting of "six forms of capital:
aspirational, linguistic, familial, social, navigational, and
resistance" (2). An educator allied with white supremacy would have
difficulty even speaking to a parent whose every move, inflection of
voice, and lived experience is different from their own. One false move
could result in punitive action towards the child, no different than a
police officer who misinterprets African American cultural norms as
something that must be countered with brute force. Remember that we are
speaking of systems. White supremacy's umbrella is large enough to cover
both the criminal justice system and the education system -- with the
school to prison pipeline being in itself a journey of progressive
discipline leading to the control of the Black body. **[[DisCrit sees
African-American ways of being as a strength through which the
curriculum and pedagogy should be informed rather than something to be,
at times, violently resisted by the education system. Labeling Black
students with disabilities as "at-risk" has led to their isolation and
opened the door for re-segregation]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the
American public school system **[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}** direct
**[[opposition to]{.mark}]{.underline}** earlier hard-fought **[[legal
victories against the practice]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Love & Baneke
2021, p.37)[.]{.mark} Underneath this desire to help Black disabled
children is **[[another reason for the]{.mark}]{.underline}** labeling
and **[[othering of Blackness in white-controlled spaces -- protection
of white children through re-segregation]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Love &
Baneke 2021, p. 35). It is one thing for a white female educator to be
exposed/subjected to the grotesquery of Black disabled bodies. It is
another to put her children among them. DisCrit identifies individual
bias and racism but sees the bigger picture in challenging white
supremacist fueled rollbacks of civil rights policy that further
disadvantage already marginalized and underserved communities. White
supremacy is ever-shifting with the times. **[[Policy and law in
disability have led to confusion as to who is considered
disabled.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It is now widely accepted that special
education is not isolated to the physical. It must also address the mind
through new learning methods for those who do not process what is widely
offered. **[[What is considered normal?]{.underline}]{.mark}** The fact
that Blackness is not considered acceptable or malleable makes many
different learning methods within the community special[.
**[Practitioners often do not understand cultural differences and the
need for new]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[teaching [methods.]{.mark} [They
instead see their purpose as an opportunity to segregate Black students
in special classrooms, ghettoizing special education and transforming it
into an exclusively black space]{.mark}]{.underline}** in some school
districts. The dilemma here is that progressive white educators reject
special education opportunities for Black students not to appear racist
(Connor et al., 2019). While this may seem commendable, it then locks
out students who might genuinely benefit from innovative new learning
strategies. There is a better approach than obsessing about the
over-representation of Black students in special education. A more
comprehensive, truthful curriculum that acknowledges the existence of
white supremacy would be a commendable starting point. DisCrit in
Practice The section above navigates theory but less so practice. How
would an educator apply DisCrit in the classroom and interactions with
Black parents? An understanding that the school itself is not always a
place filled with pleasant childhood memories might be of value as the
teacher prepares to engage with Black families in that space[.
**[Accepting that what is (at times) difficult for the educator to see
does not mean that it does not exist.]{.underline}**]{.mark} This is an
appropriate starting point, especially as it relates to issues of race.
For a teacher of any race, to see all forms of resistance from parents
and students as defiance, pushback, oppositional behavior, and overall
unreasonable diversions from learning is an error. To expect lockstep
compliance within a system that has often failed Black families means
**[[that there needs to be a more nuanced interpretation of what is
being observed in]{.mark}]{.underline}** the classroom or parent-teacher
[**[interactions]{.underline}**.]{.mark} As noted by this DisCrit tenet,
children of Color with dis/abilities and their families intentionally
act in the face of marginalization, and such actions should be respected
as necessary communication to support justice efforts rather than simply
targets for intervention. For example, Collins (2011) described how a
Black child with perceived challenging behaviors engaged in literacy
moves to confront deficit positioning and capitalize on self-identified
strengths. **[[Acknowledging]{.mark} such [behaviors as intentional
forms of participation, rather than disruptions, encourages innovative
practice and counters deficit assumptions that hinder inclusive
education.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Similarly, families of Color often
resist deficit positioning of their children by engaging in behaviors
that are not traditionally recognized as parent involvement, such as
refusing disability labeling and enacting culturally meaningful
parenting (Kaomea, 2005; Lalvani, 2014; Waters, 2016). Understanding
such acts as necessary family advocacy and engagement creates new
avenues for family--professional partnerships supporting young children
(Love & Baneke 2021, p.40). The school should not in any way resemble a
prison. Parents have a right to question what is being taught to their
children, and the children themselves have to be their genuine selves to
process what is being provided by the educator. **[[DisCrit]{.mark}
[advocates]{.mark} are not [ask]{.mark}ing for special treatment of
[Black students with disabilities]{.mark}, but that [they are given the
room to learn in an environment that values their existence and
recognizes their humanity.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It's not too much for
an educator to engage parents as equals and children as young people who
explore possibilities and at times test boundaries. DisCrit advocates
demand the above. None of which is too much to require of the education
system.

Echoing Sara Ahmed's understanding of the future as "a question \[that\]
unfolds \[...\] in the present" (Promise, 164[), I want to come back to
the questions that opened this article in order to ruminate on what it
means to cruise a geopolitical time and place that apparently no longer
exists.]{.underline} [I want to ask what the vantage point crafted from
the specific historical experience of socialism and the post-socialist
transition offers to critiques of neoliberalism---more specifically, to
critiques formulated from cripistemological perspectives and what we
might perceive as reorientations toward crip futures. specifically, to
critiques formulated from [cripistemological perspectives and what we
might perceive as reorientations toward crip
futures]{.mark}]{.underline}. In engaging with these questions, I come
back to [[Berlant's concept of cruel optimism]{.underline}]{.mark},
[which has been extremely helpful as I [identify]{.mark} [structural
attachments to promises of better futures that created the ideological
base of the project of transition]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The engagement
with post-socialist material also shows, however, that **[Berlant's
brilliant discussion of the toxicity of the neoliberal version of the
promise of a good life needs]{.mark}**, as I implied earlier, to be
[reformulated not only to correspond to the specificity of the
particular experience of post-socialism, but also to reveal how such a
confrontation brings forth more general challenges and lines of
critique]{.mark}]{.underline}. [There is a strange incongruity in and
around Berlant's book. Disability is literally on its cover, as the crip
artist Riva Lehrer provided the cover image, If Body: Riva and Zora in
Middle Age. It is embedded in the title of the book, as "**[cruel
optimism" could in fact be a very appropriate name for the violent,
recuperative, and compulsory optimism of the cultural logic of
rehabilitation to which "the disabled" are permanently
subjected.]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[The book's discussions are
haunted by disability, and at times it is even evoked directly, yet only
through the clinical and medicalized language of "disease,"
"depression," "obesity," "spina bifida," rather than through the
transformative and politicized vocabulary of cripness.]{.underline} In
this sense, [Berlant's book replicates the failing of the majority of
critical work that exposes the neoliberal debasement of the values of
solidarity, social justice, and equity.]{.underline} This lack of
discussion is startling. In[deed, how is it possible that the bulk of
critiques of neoliberalism and neoliberal governmentality provides such
engaging and incisive insights into the politics of maximizing vitality,
capitalizing on the very act of living, or exposing the morbid
utilization of "slow death" and the necropolitical distribution of
death, yet does so without including disability/cripness in its
analytical instrumentarium? How can a discussion of "the politics of
life" itself do without a category that is integral to modern
definitions of life and vitality?]{.underline} [Taking up the one crip
lead from the book, I speak to the image of If Body (approaching it
differently to Berlant herself in her closing]{.underline} "Note on the
cover image" \[265--67\]) and ask what a critique of cruel optimism
would look like if it thought of crip bodies, if it thought of crip
bodies elsewhere from the Western context, and if it thought of crip
existence in the context of post-socialist, neoliberal promises.6

[In [formulating the crip reading of cruel optimism, in cripping cruel
optimism]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [we need to address the different
affective structures of post-socialist promises]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[We also need to read those affective structures along with and perhaps
against the relationality of cruel optimism Berlant first
identified]{.underline}. Most importantly**[, [the concept needs to be
expanded so that its more capacious definition would account for the
pressures of compulsory able-bodiedness and for the specific experiences
of disabled people and crips.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In other words,
[Berlant's concept of toxic and hurtful promises and her repertoire of
critical analysis of fantasies of the good life call for encounters with
crip versions of "life" as well as for a cripping of the notion ofcr the
"good life." They need to be read more carefully and closely along with
the realities of lives that were never promised (let alone lived
through) by this liberal fantasy, lives that are appropriated and
colonized by images of "life not worth living," or lives that are at
times not even granted the recognition of life itself.]{.underline} [The
transition into neoliberalism produced forms of affective citizenship
based on what Berlant calls "aspirational normativity]{.underline}"
(164). In the post-socialist context[, the aspiration promising the
utopia of the "good life" was not expressed in the imperative to keep
going; the moral aspiration of the post-socialist transition was by
definition that of rehabilitation, overcoming the failure and shame of
the bad past]{.underline}. It was not the "nearly utopian" (163--64)
desire for a prolonged present, but the "nearly utopian" desire for a
recuperative future[. The cruelty of the post-socialist moment lies---as
I hope my analysis above unmasks---in conditioning forms of social
belonging through an "affectivity of debt," discourses of overcoming,
and fantasies of cure.]{.underline} [The cultural grammar of
rehabilitation saturated the political and the social so fully that
claims to social equity could be disavowed and turned into a chimera,
the crip monstrous ghost haunting the post-socialist redefinition of
sociality and community, where any form of social belonging for
crips]{.underline} [other than under the rubrics of paternalizingly
charitable humanism was (and remains) virtually impossible]{.underline}
(see also Kolářová[). **[Registering the temporal coincidence of
different structures of compulsory optimism also emphasizes their cruel
irony]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [The project of [rehabilitating the
post-socialist crip virtually overlaps with the moment when]{.mark}, in
the West, states started to retract their social welfare
commitments]{.underline}. Even more specifically, [the countries in
"transition" served to uphold the fantasies of success, health, and the
general "good life" made possible by capitalism.]{.underline} For
instance, with the claims that it was living the "post-communist dream"
(qtd. in Weiner 53), the Czech Republic was in the early 1990s (before
the myth of smooth, straightforward, and successful transition was
ruptured by the first crisis in 1994) put forth as the model for the
countries of the former Eastern Bloc. The "teleology of 'transition'"
(Hann 9) of the post-socialist countries along the same path the West
followed decades earlier (see also Verdery) also served, however, as an
important projection space for the "West," where the apparent
rehabilitative capacity of capitalism in the East was utilized to
bolster the "secular faith" (Duggan xiii) in (neoliberal) capitalism as
the only possibility for human history. This did not go completely
unnoticed, as the key figure of the Czech transformation, Václav Klaus,
himself notes: "It is nearly paradoxical that the speeches of some of us
\[sic\] delivered in the West are perceived not only as signs of the
vital renaissance of thought in the East, but are also sought after as a
support in their own ideological skirmishes" (Klaus, "Síla," 1). Yet, in
his ego-centrism, **[Klaus did not draw the conclusions at hand: that
the project of rehabilitation/transformation in the "East" and its shock
method helped to sustain the "West"---and at the same time inhibited the
development of a critical crip consciousness in both
locations.]{.underline}**

Definitions DisCrit builds upon the legal activism embedded within
Critical Legal Studies (CLS), CRT, and DS. Its voice is as inclusive as
CRT's, with change agents approaching its strictly theoretical elements
in an expansive and interdisciplinary manner. It interrogates and
engages history, sexuality, gender, the whole person (body and mind),
organizational development, conflict resolution, family studies, and
personal and community agency. DisCrit places the disabled child in the
center as a subject rather than an object of their liberation. The last
element places it squarely within an African-centered approach to change
that predates even CRT in the 1970s. One of CRTs founders, Kimberley
Crenshaw, declares that it "is not a noun, but a verb. It cannot be
confined to a static and narrow definition but is considered to be an
evolving and malleable practice" (George, 2021). DisCrit is inspired and
driven by the spirit of its theoretical predecessor. Raush et al. (2019)
capture the definition of DisCrit as a theory and the possibilities of
its application in practice: Consider the marginalization that Children
of Color with dis/abilities and their families experience due to the
intersection of power and privilege around race and dis/ability\[...\]
**[[the DisCrit framework can be used to understand how a difference in
power]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g., between
administrators/teachers/schools and families[) **[can lead to the
exclusion of]{.underline}**]{.mark} very young **[[children with
dis/abilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** and other social identities and
their families \[...\] (Raush et al., 2019 p. 45). In America, it is
dangerous to praise an unfinished project. **[[The passage of a law, the
change of a policy, and the adoption of an inclusive curriculum are
often seen as the conclusion of engagement rather than its start. What
DisCrit does is challenge/interrogate well-meaning law/theory/policy to
agitate for action and function as a reminder of the centuries of broken
promises America has made to its most vulnerable citizens and
residents.]{.mark} [With DisCrit, there is no sacred space for white
supremacy to hide]{.mark}. Furthermore[, there is no faith in a system
that has proven repeatedly that it is willing to view the codification
of best wishes as satisfactory for a population that should be grateful
even to be acknowledged.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Disability Law, Policy
and Implementation **[[Those]{.underline}]{.mark}** resistant to further
reform of special education in American classrooms **[[point to the
existence of disability law and well-meaning child-focused policy as
positive proof that America has changed for the
better]{.underline}]{.mark}** in its treatment of all children with
special needs. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and Title II of the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA), if applied equitably, would bring America
closer to its stated aim of inclusion and protection for students with
disabilities (ADA National Network, 2018). Further, the policy created
by the Division for Early Childhood and the National Association for
Education of Young Children, on the surface, acknowledge there are a
multiplicity of innovative ways to educate children in the American
classroom. However**[[, applying the most positive standards will be
limited without an interrogation of race and white supremacy. If the
default from which all changes occur is whiteness, then what of those
who are not white? If whiteness is the standard, then the beneficiary of
these gifts would need to be white or white adjacent to be worthy of
receiving anything meaningful from the system. With this in mind,
education of special needs children of African descent would first be an
exercise in diminishing their blackness to make them deserving of the
assistance on offer. DisCrit is forced to involve itself in pushing
against the othering of Black students and questioning the utility of an
exercise in whitening black spaces through pacification and policing of
Black bodies]{.underline}]{.mark}**---students, parents, administrators,
teachers---any Black body.

[Narratives about people of color with cognitive disabilities are
difficult to come by, generally speaking.9 [The]{.mark} largest
[stumbling block]{.mark} is the issue [of representation: who represents
whom, and where those representations occur.]{.mark}]{.underline} There
have been some popular representations of Black people with cognitive
disabilities, most recently celebrity mothers of autistic children. This
cadre of mothers includes famed R&B chanteuse Toni Braxton, actress
Holly Robinson Peete, and actress and singer Tisha Campbell-Martin.
Their work largely focuses on advocacy for their children. [On the
occasions when their children do speak (usually within the context of
reality television), they tend to voice overcoming narratives. Largely,
these tellings rely on the idea that the cognitive disability is an
invisible one, which poses trouble because it is not readily understood
as disability.]{.underline} The resulting misunderstandings, bullying,
or trauma stems from the unrecognizability of these illnesses. These
narratives fall in line, culturally speaking, with the arguments of
those of Nirmala Erevelles, Allison Carey, and Michael Bérubé, who all
agree that the repercussion of announcing oneself or being identified as
cognitively disabled is a loss of citizenship rights. [Here, the [rights
are not merely material but]{.mark} can also [include cultural
capital]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Invisibility surfaces as a
long-standing component of]{.mark} stories about [Blacks with cognitive
disabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [During the antebellum period,
slaveholders could demand compensation for supposedly unfit slaves.
Within the critical literature, the understanding of physical and mental
fitness are combined not only because slaves were not thought to be
particularly intelligent but also because mental fitness was a necessary
component in some assessments of physical labor. So-called [soundness of
mind was determined by a confluence of physical and mental conditions
such as "skin color, gender, character, vice, health, body, and
emotional state]{.mark}."10 One of the characteristics of fitness was a
[degree of mental acuity]{.mark} (which slavers were likely to miss upon
initial inspection of the human property) and a [characteristic for
which slavers could demand compensation]{.mark}. **[Successful
litigation]{.mark} often [depended on the slaver's ability to
prove]{.mark} that [the human property was unable to perform]{.mark} the
[duties]{.mark} for which it was purchased. Most important for these
discussions is that [the litigation occurred after sales were
made]{.mark}, indicating that slavers were expected to have recourse to
legal action for impairments that were not visible at the time of
purchase**]{.underline}. In this paradigm, [**[one's worth as a Black
person with a cognitive impairment]{.mark}**---no matter its imaginary
quality---**[is determined by one's production]{.mark}.** [Such
possibilities for legal action created a link between the mental acuity
of enslaved persons, invisibility, and profit.]{.mark} This connection
appears in the discourse regarding rehabilitation in the early twentieth
century as well. The historical record conflates physical ability and
mental ability as a way to disenfranchise Blacks
economically.]{.underline} Here, I mine the gaps in critical literature
similarly to my earlier discussion of Rosemarie Garland Thomson. Black
World War I veterans contended with rehabilitation policies that
"devalued, deskilled, and institutionalized \[them\] and dismissed their
claims to rehabilitation as spurious attempts to unjustly profit from
their 'natural inferiority.'"[11 Rather than review their claims as
disabilities acquired during military service, officials delegitimized
Black veterans' need for rehabilitation by ascribing their disabilities
to venereal disease and tuberculosis, which were, again according to
officials, endemic to the race.]{.underline} **[[This rhetoric built
upon the idea of Blackness itself as a congenital, cognitive
defect]{.underline}]{.mark}** (further conflating physical ailment with
cognitive impairment). [The result was the removal of some veterans from
the communities to which they may have contributed and of which they
were definitely a part]{.underline}. When these veterans were denied
rehabilitation, they were also denied the opportunity to earn a living
in the postwar labor economy. Here, the connection between mental
acuity, invisibility, and profit arises again. This time, [the putative
defect of [Blackness gives rise to an imagined and invisible cognitive
impairment that circumscribes the availability of economic
self-determination.]{.mark}]{.underline} Though cognitive impairment is
not, strictly speaking, emblazoned on the flesh, it nevertheless
subtends interaction as a structuring presence. The conception about
worth, particularly related to capitalist profit and economic viability,
becomes imbricated in the narratives about cognitive disability.
Entangled here, enfolded here, are legibility, visibility, economic
viability, and cognitive disability. On the one hand, [cognitive
disability and the rhetoric thereof are marshaled as a way to justify
exclusion from resources. On the other hand, cognitive disability
becomes visible when one cannot prove one's worth or value to the labor
economy. In either case, cognitive disability remains wedded to its
legibility as an identity category, regardless of whether it is linked
to other categories (Blackness itself).]{.underline} [One reads
cognitive disability based on interaction within a community regardless
of whether that cognitive disability has a diagnosis
attached.]{.underline} Such a reading may be complicated by the shifting
terrain of legibility, determined as it is by cultural expectation,
social convention, and medical narratives about cognition. [Of interest
to this conversation is how observation and visibility rests at the crux
of these ideas: namely, one believes that one can judge, ascertain, and
observe cognitive disability at work]{.underline}. The stare, despite
its interrogative heft, is incomplete.12 The problem is that these
understandings operate with ocularity as the central sensory praxis
despite the fact that legibility is not determined by sight, neither
singularly nor primarily. **[[Cognitive disability disrupts sight as
having exclusive critical purchase over
interpretation.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### 2AC \-\-- Debate is a game 

#### Even if debate is a game, you should transform it into a [mad game]{.underline} challenges projections of ableist violence into the space

Cecilia **Rodéhn 22** Aassociate professor and a senior lecturer at the
Centre for Gender Research and Department of Game Design, Uppsala
University, 2022, Introducing Mad Studies and Mad Reading to Game
Studies, -ekh-\]

[**[A mad reading of games]{.mark} seeks [to identify]{.mark} the
[workings of normative ableist discourses in texts and how sanism is
conflated with other oppressive regimes.]{.mark}** The purpose is to
interrupt and resist sanism]{.underline}. Investigating representations
of [[sanism is also a good starting point for the exploration]{.mark}
[of madness]{.mark}.]{.underline} The reason for this is that many
representations of madness in games are sanist. This means that madness
often appears through the lens of sanism, and sanism is [seen through
madness in games]{.underline}. However, there isn't just one kind of
sanism in games, which I shall now discuss.

In many games, mental illness is embodied by male characters (cf.
Shapiro and Rotter, 2016, p. 1594). This is perhaps no surprise, seeing
that men are overall overrepresented in games at large (cf. Taylor &
Voorhees, 2018). Male characters with mental illness are often portrayed
as violent, psychotic, and homicidal maniacs (Shapiro & Rotter, 2016, p.
1594; Ferrari et al., 2019, p. 6). Violent behaviour is often associated
with masculinity in games, but [games portray a kind of masculinity
where violence is expressed as controlled by an often emotionally stoic
character.]{.underline} Male characters with [mental
illness]{.underline} are often [contrasted with this stoic
masculinity]{.underline}. For instance, Scarecrow in the
action-adventure game Batman: Arkham Knight (Rocksteady Studios, 2015)
exhibits erratic, emotional, and unpredictable behaviour, and the
patients in Mount Massive Asylum in the first-person survival horror
game Outlast (Red Barrells, 2013) are represented as both catatonic and
scared or as butchering the staff and raping corpses.

**[[Women]{.underline}]{.mark}**, on the other hand, are often
[**[represented as victims]{.mark} and/ [or patients]{.mark}** of
psychiatric facilities [in games]{.mark}]{.underline} [(]{.mark}Shapiro
& Rotter, 2016, pp. 1592-1594). These depictions can be connected to the
tradition of [objectifying women in games and [portraying them as
passive and]{.mark}/ or damsels [in distress]{.mark}]{.underline}. A
recent trend in games is to present girls as those dealing with mental
illness, such as in platform-adventure game Gris (Nomada Studio, 2018),
the platform role-playing video game Child of Light (Ubisoft Montreal,
2014) and the platform video game Celeste (Matt Makes Games, 2018).
[Representing mental illness using children as a metaphor offers
possibilities to highlight the vulnerability of the person suffering
from mental illness, but this is problematic due to a long tradition of
portraying the relationship between doctors/nurses and mental patients
as one of a parent to a child.]{.underline} In addition, China Mills and
Brenda Lefrançois shows that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
(DSM-V), which is a manual that classifies and explains illnesses and
behaviours and functions as a handbook for health care services, lists
"childishness" and "childlike behaviour" in adults as a symptom of
mental illness (Mills & Lefrançois, 2018, p. 512). Furthermore,
psychiatric discourse marks people experiencing mental illness as
underdeveloped or wrongly developed (Mills & Lefrançois, 2018, p. 504).
Representing mental illness as a child or through a child's perspective
unfortunately works to reproduce discourses of mental patients as
infantilized.

[**[Sanism]{.mark}** also **[needs to be positioned in relation
to]{.mark}** issues of **[race]{.mark}** and ethnicity since stereotypes
of mental illness are often conflated with stereotypes of race and
ethnicity]{.underline} (Rodéhn, 2020). Research shows that there [is a
history]{.underline} of [**[denoting Jewish and African American groups
as predestined for madness,]{.mark}** revealing that race, ethnicity,
and madness are conflated in cultural representations]{.underline}
(Gilman 1985, pp. 24-25, 162). For instance, [[**Blackness has been
considered as equal to madness,** **and**]{.mark} blackness became **[a
prerequisite for the social constructions of
madness]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Pickens, 2019, p. 4). I suggest that
[this construction of Blackness is the source for why Black men have
been portrayed as irrational, unpredictable, and violent in
games.]{.underline} An example of this is the pirate lord Vaas
Montenegro in the first-person shooter game Far Cry 3 (Ubisoft Montreal,
2012), who is depicted as loud, erratic, sadistic, and violent.

Adrienne Shaw shows that Black and indigenous women are almost
non-existent in games, and when portrayed, they are often depicted as
abuse victims (Shaw 2014, p. 21). In popular culture, Black women are
commonly portrayed as lazy, slow-minded or angry and/or seductive, which
are also characteristics used to represent people diagnosed with mental
illness (Mollow 2006). The way sanism is intertwined with colonization
and racism needs special attention because when sanism is visited on
racialized bodies it is especially devastating (Meerai, Abdillahi &
Poole, 2016, p. 22). Characterizations of mental illness in video games,
where the character is explained as having a diagnosis or illness,
occurs more among characters that are white and male. This suggests that
white people are represented as suffering from a condition, whereas
Black people are merely represented as erratic and violent.

Furthermore, it is common that queer and transgender characters are
represented as mentally unstable in games. One example of this is the
character Reni Wassulmaier, introduced in action-adventure game Grand
Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories (Rock Star Games, 2005) and reappearing
in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories (Rock Star Games, 2006). Reni
Wassulmaier is portrayed as a prostitute and a porn star. Reni was
assigned female at birth, but they go through four gender confirmation
surgeries: female-to-male, male-to-female, female-tomale again, and then
male-to-female again. This transphobic representation, parodying the
process of gender confirmation surgery, works to portray Reni
Wassulmaier as mad and as having erratic behaviour \-- not being able to
decide on a gender. The result of this is that queerness is represented
as madness and madness as queerness. The connection between madness and
queerness is not new; there is a history of pathologizing and diagnosing
transgender people in, for instance, the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual
of Mental Disorders. The conflation can also be seen in terms of
sexuality. Reni Wassulmaier is characterized as a mad seductress, trying
to seduce every man they meet in all different kinds of situations.
Shapiro and Rotter show that the appropriation of the mad seductress
trope is well-established in media and used as a way to connect feminine
and female sexuality to madness (Shapiro & Rotter, 2016). In Grand Theft
Auto, the trope is used to portray Reni's madness and reveal the
tendencies to pathologize femininity and feminine sexuality as performed
outside the boundaries of heteronormativity.

I suggest that, [[to]{.mark} expose and [resist
sanism]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [the following questions can be useful
guidelines to conduct a mad reading]{.underline}]{.mark} [of games: (1)
**[What normative discourses produce madness in the game that is being
studied]{.mark}, and [how are these representations connected to other
oppressive]{.mark} [ideologies]{.mark}?** (2) **[What kind of madness
does the intersection of sanism and other oppressive ideologies
produce?]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Dōgen *\*Modified for harsh language*

[In Booker T. Washington's]{.underline} famous 1895 [Atlanta Cotton
States and International Exhibition Address, he identifies that a
post-Reconstruction backlash depended on the biopolitical production of
a lived experience of Black health precarity and tactical
debilitation]{.underline}. In this "compromise" speech, [Washington
repeatedly asserts,]{.underline} as most commentators note, [the
important role that African Americans ought to play as the laboring race
in the industrial development of a New South]{.underline}.48 But
[Washington's selling of African Americans as the "most patient,
faithful, law-abiding, and unresentful" workforce]{.underline} that mill
owners and manufacturers might hire [is accompanied by an appeal as well
to postemancipation myths about a disabled African American race and, in
turn, to the region's fears about biosecurity.]{.underline}49 [As part
of]{.underline} his ["pragmatism,"]{.underline} it is frequently noted,
[Washington targets---and appeases---white self-interest, but Washington
also taps into white (as well as Black) fears and anxieties about
African American productive vitality]{.underline}. After assuring white
southerners that African Americans do not seek social equality---willing
to remain separate as fingers, but work as one hand in "all things
essential to mutual progress"--- Washington adds a thinly veiled threat
that most in the audience would have hardly failed to detect: the
"nearly sixteen millions of hands will aid you in pulling your load
upward," [Washington]{.underline} [warns]{.underline}, or, switching
suddenly from the synecdoche of "hands" to the first person, [as if to
call attention to his own embodied presence, "we shall prove a veritable
body of death, stagnating, depressing, retarding every effort to advance
the body politic"]{.underline} (222). [In his language that African
Americans excluded from participation in the New Southern economy will
"\[slow down\]" and not advance the "body politic,]{.underline}"
[and]{.underline} indeed they [will putrefy as a "veritable body of
death,"]{.underline} [Washington invokes a]{.underline} highly
contentious and statistically driven [public debate prompted by African
America]{.underline} post--Civil War health inequalities: [since
emancipation, it was widely publicized, African Americans were a
diseased, debilitated, and even, as Washington notes here, dying race in
the absence of their masters' care and protection]{.underline} (see
chapters 1 and 2).50 [But what does it mean, we need to ask, that
Washington frames African American progress---the question of African
American citizenship--- around an opposition between Black capacity and
debility?]{.underline} What does it mean that commentators have erased
this line in their remembering of Washington's speech and in the
repeated criticism of his failure to demand immediate civil or political
rights, or both? [Washington's compromise speech talks
back]{.underline}, as we will see in chapter 1, [to postemancipation
debates over the contagious, disabled, and dying African American by
reframing and placing these health disparities in the larger context of
a post Reconstruction vitality politics. In his promotion of Black
labor]{.underline} in the New Southern economy [Washington pinpoints
that postemancipation antiblackness revolved]{.underline} around [not
just the denial of rights---to work, to public access, to
opportunity---but that antiblackness in the afterlife of slavery
functions through the creating of cycles of debilitation and recovery
that keep African Americans always on the edge of health and, thus, as
the surplus laborers in racial capitalism]{.underline}. As Washington
implies in his address, conserving the "wages of whiteness" (to borrow
David Roediger's famous phrase) means neglecting and debilitating black
bodies and minds to naturalize their comparative inadequacy.51 In
tracing out the diverse techniques grouped under the idea of biopower,
or the way politics intervenes into the vital characteristics of
biological and mental life, Michel Foucault distinguished between two
general technologies: although much of Foucault's early work focused on
the production of individual discipline or the individual's
internalizing of the surveillance, control, and norms implemented in the
factory, the schoolhouse, the asylum, and the prison, Foucault's later
work focused on a biopolitics that operated on the level of
populations.52 As part of this biopolitics in mass, social scientists,
public health officials, reformers, politicians, and race activists
sought to track, survey, and regulate various demographics' births, life
expectancy, mortality, and general level of health. [As Washington's
often redacted appeal to the debilitated Black body
reveals]{.underline}, [as part of]{.underline} the post-Reconstruction
[racial reordering, biopolitics broadened and shifted from tactics of
direct exclusion to a dialectical regime of imposed Black debility
followed by surveillance, recovery, and assistance toward optimized
capacity]{.underline}, or what post-Reconstruction commentators called
vitality, according to the demands of an industrial labor market.53 As
part of U.S. national fantasies of liberal meritocracy, all citizens had
to learn to monitor, assess, and "conserve" their vital resources for
their personal success as well as the conservation of the race. However,
a post Reconstruction [politics of Black debility worked through an
environmentally produced corporeal and mental enervation to render
freedmen and women as a contrasting disposable population of
decapacitated life incapable of achieving the aspirational promises of
self-perfectibility, opportunity, economic productivity, material
success, and mobility]{.underline}. [As a result, "New \[Blacks\]" in
racial uplift's politics of respectability were not simply "policed"
according to the norms of middle-class propriety.]{.underline}54 [They
were debilitated,]{.underline} and, [as a result]{.underline}, the
[post-Reconstruction period saw a shift toward data
gathering]{.underline} and actuarial assessments by insurance companies
and public health officials [that broke down the African American
"citizen-patient" into an assemblage of risks, statistics, and
biomedical predictions that created new networked forms of surveillance
and control]{.underline}. Race leaders' rehabilitative program and their
invocation of a language of recovery and cure, however, sought to
regulate particularly the behavior of Black women and the poor. I want
to end this initial brief historical contextualization of early
twentieth-century vitality politics by looking at National \[Black\]
Health Week, and, especially, one health week bulletin from 1927.

[Most of the action in The Chinaberry Tree occurs in the past time of
the novel]{.underline} and is over when the story opens as the
characters struggle to move beyond its traumatic consequences. [The
novel's recovery plot,]{.underline} thus, [builds]{.underline} its
[suspense on the question of the "redemption," or, in the medicalized
terms of the novel, "healing" and rehabilitation]{.underline},
[of]{.underline} the two main protagonists: [Laurentine Strange and her
cousin Melissa Paul]{.underline}. [In the backstory of the novel Sal
Strange, Laurentine's mother, had a scandalous affair with a white
man,]{.underline} Colonel Halloway, who moved her from Alabama to set
her up in a beautiful house with a chinaberry tree in Red Brook, New
Jersey. [Although Sal and Colonel Halloway's sexual union recalls the
familiar story of the plantation master's sexual exploitation of his
kept slave mistress, Aunt Sal insists that her relation with the now
deceased Colonel Halloway was a "love story"]{.underline} and "she to
this day still loves him" (2). [After the birth of
Laurentine]{.underline}, "Aunt [Sal,]{.underline}" as she is generally
called, [remains]{.underline} a "[maladjusted,"]{.underline} overly
sensitive, tragic mulatta[, ostracized from both the white and Black
communities of the town who condemn her as having "vicious" or "bad
blood]{.underline}," [thus seeing her moral impropriety as resulting, as
an earlier race psychology maintained, from hereditary character
defects.]{.underline} When Laurentine was a young girl, however, her
mother's sister Judy came to stay in Red Brook and temporarily relieved
the family's isolation. During Judy's visit to Red Brook, she has an
affair with the husband of one of her friends, Sylvester Forten, which
results in the birth of another "illegitimate" daughter, Melissa Paul,
who later, in the present time of the novel, falls in love and plans to
wed unwittingly her half brother Malory Forten. Like Maggie in There Is
Confusion, Melissa is a class outsider who has a "morbid" and restless
ambition to be part of "larger and more brilliant settings" within the
exclusive circles of the town's Black bourgeois elite (71), and, as a
consequence, she initially declines marriage with the "essentially
sound" southerner Asshur Lane because she insists on wedding a wealthy
and socially prominent man, Malory Forten (337). In the novel's
denouement, the "secrets" of the past are finally revealed, including
that Maggie and Malory are half brothers and sisters. But if such a
tragic disclosure of possible incest might have permanently broken the
"strange" women, both Laurentine and Melissa are "adjusted" to a
"healthy wellbeing" (medical language that Fauset herself uses) by the
men in their lives (120): first, Dr. Denleigh, a former head of the
National Medical Association, who heals Laurentine of her "melancholy"
(113), and, second, Asshur Lane, whose "fine, sweet sanity, a strength,"
in the novel's final tableau under the chinaberry tree ensures Melissa's
recovery from her own feverish "morbid" desires that nearly caused her
to break unwittingly one of the most fundamental taboos (336). Although
[Fauset's Th]{.underline}e [Chinaberry Tree follows once again the
medicalized recovery narrative of social psychology]{.underline} that we
saw in There Is Confusion, [in which the restless, angry Black
woman]{.underline} (Melissa) [must be cured by the good Black man's
"sweet sanity,"]{.underline} I want to focus on [the rehabilitation
storyline of the novel]{.underline}'s other main female protagonist,
Laurentine Strange, for what it [reveals]{.underline} about the [complex
biopolitics of Black women's depression in the Jim Crow United
States]{.underline}. Throughout the novel [Laurentine is depicted
variously as "melancholy"]{.underline} (113), as having an "irregular"
life (69), as highly sensitive and "withdrawn to herself " (19), as full
of "restlessness" and "hopeless brooding" (98), and "sick" with
"hopelessness." Although [the plot traces out how she learns to become
"more normal]{.underline}" (98) once she is taken under the wing of Dr.
and Mrs. Ismay (herself a trained nurse from Boston) and is courted by
Dr. Denleigh, once again [Fauset creates a contradictory novel in which
there is more meaning in the "disorder" than in the cure, and indeed the
novel blurs the boundaries between social psychology's distinctions
between maladjustment and integration, disorder and rehabilitation.
Laurentine's cure, Fauset implies, is forced, artificial, and silencing
of the way that Black women like Laurentine speak and witness through
their mental distress and pain.]{.underline} As Fauset demonstrates,
Black women's depression, whatever biochemical (or blood) roots may be
behind it, is embedded within the unequal gendered and racial relations
that Black women daily "weather" and which define their proper, "good"
feminine identity. I want to look for a moment at Fauset's description
of Laurentine's "bitter and futile life" before she is rescued by Dr.
Denleigh for what it says about Laurentine's "strange" character, and
for what it says about Black women's "strange" or "mad politics" of
mental distress: But she \[Laurentine\] was sick. Sick not only with
wounded pride and bewilderment, but with something far worse than
that--- hopelessness. For what could she expect? She would live like
this always, seeing herself ripen, ripen---she was twenty-four, there
were many years of cruel, burning, unsatisfied life still before her.
Yes, she would ripen---some poet had said it---"ripen, fall and cease."
It would be exactly as though she had never been; like a leaf that had
fallen too early; like a flower that someone had picked and deliberately
thrown away,---no worse, had carelessly dropped to be trampled on,
withered. So had her mother and Colonel Halloway dropped her and she was
being trampled on, withered. (61--62) [In]{.underline} the [language
describing Laurentine's depression]{.underline}, [Fauset indicates that
her "pathology" is her body's way of speaking, doubting, and trying to
repress feelings and thoughts that are at odds with the "healthy" "sane"
forms of respectable Black womanhood.]{.underline} Although Laurentine
does not acknowledge the source of the poetic refrain that organizes her
meditation, the line "ripen, fall, and cease" comes from Alfred Lord
Tennyson's "The Lotus Eaters" and refers to the temptation of the
sailors to renounce the hard life of the sea to remain in the seductive
tranquility of the home of the "lotus." The irony here is that
Fauset/Laurentine correlates the futile "numbing" life to the domestic
scene (not the sea) and to the respectability expected of "good" race
women. In contrast to this "good" and "unsensational/unfelt" life,
however, is the "unsatisfied burning" (willed, angry, sexual) that
Laurentine cannot act on due to codes of gender, race, and class imposed
on Black women. Instead, she feels as if she can only ripen unfulfilled
and "cease." Thus, Laurentine's depression, social withdrawal, and
fatigue are, Fauset implies, both a sign of mental distress and a
complex expression of insight: an anxiety and hopelessness voicing her
frustration and inability to act in the face of systematic oppressions
(whether those oppression are the everyday nerve-wrecking psychological
maimings imposed by white supremacism, or the codes of respectability
placed on Black women). As a result, Laurentine turns her anger inward.
In this scene, [Fauset traces out a new language of Black women's
depression that identifies it not as emptiness within, but as a violence
imposed from without on Black women's vitality, or their flowering into
themselves.]{.underline}

In 1992, psychiatrist Judith Herman published Trauma and Recovery: The
Aftermath of Violence---From Domestic Abuse to Political Terror. In this
important intervention, Herman argued that the [trauma that results from
domestic violence and sexual assault, as part of patriarchal aggression,
constitutes a type of political violence or even gendered
terrorism]{.underline}. As it also tends to be quite commonplace yet
simultaneously hidden from view (and thus complicated and insidious in
its effects), Herman made the case that the traumatic symptomology that
follows from domestic violence and sexual assault must be
reconceptualized---thus heralding the shift from post-traumatic stress
disorder, or PTSD (which had up to that point been reserved primarily
for the "shell shock" experienced by soldiers in war), to complex
post-traumatic stress disorder, or C-PTSD. C-PTSD was to be understood
as distinct from PTSD in part because "the syndrome \[or spectrum of
conditions\] that follows upon prolonged, repeated trauma needs its own
name."[1](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-1) [The
most important aspects to note about the shift to C-PTSD include the
following: 1) **[sexual trauma is]{.mark}** most often **[gendered
and]{.mark}** specifically **[feminized]{.mark}** as it is
disproportionately experienced by women, 2) **[one of the most]{.mark}**
notable and **[common symptoms]{.mark}** of this feminized trauma
**[is dissociation]{.mark}**, or the splitting of consciousness as a
protective mechanism (as it has been since early Freudian formulations
of hysteria and other feminine neuroses), and 3) **the
[symptoms]{.mark}** of dissociation and other traumatic sequelae **[may
be ordinary, ongoing, and quite
literally complex.]{.mark}**]{.underline} In explicating this shift,
Herman brought gendered and sexualized violence into mainstream
psychological and therapeutic conversations and illuminated their
inherently structural nature. C-PTSD arguably brought thinking on trauma
closer to the chronic, as well, as it attended to the effects of
prolonged exposure to violence. Herman staunchly advocated that the
conceptual groundwork of trauma must account for the minutiae of the
everyday life of domestic violence victims, which subsequently
illuminated how so many [forms of gendered trauma are "not outside the
range"[2](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-2) of
normal human experience, and are not exceptional. For Herman, too much
of what happens in the home, in the bedroom, and on the street might be
seriously dangerous and traumatizing to women, in particular. **[The
personal is political]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

One of the most common symptoms of trauma, in Herman's analysis as in
others, is the dissociative silence that accompanies it. C-PTSD then
still remains within the traditional psychoanalytic trauma theory
framework, relegating trauma to that which cannot be narrated,
categorically. So, although Herman placed trauma itself squarely within
the sociopolitical, she did not question **[[the ontological status of
trauma's unspeakability]{.underline}]{.mark}**---understood to be [the
[result of **a temporal split and the subsequent need for psychic
defense**]{.mark} due to an experience that was quite literally
**[unthinkable and thus also unsayable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this
essay, I question trauma's fundamental inability to be spoken of or even
adequately recounted by survivors. Is trauma unnarratable by nature, or
are traumatized people instead just too often part of communities that
are either ignored or actively silenced? To this end, I propose that
[trauma's unnarratability is not fundamental nor ontological, but rather
political and structural.]{.underline} And [this may be particularly
true for the feminized trauma that results from domestic violence,
sexual assault, and other gendered---and, importantly here,
racialized---aggressions.]{.underline}

As revolutionary as it was at the time, Herman's reframing was also
insufficient in attending to the full breadth of trauma responses across
experiences of gender and femininity (i.e., cis, trans, nonbinary,
agender, genderqueer, etc.), and experiences related to race, class,
nation, and citizenship. Dissociation, still centered in Herman's C-PTSD
framework, has become the sine qua non of trauma and has been treated as
necessary for trauma to register as legible and legitimate---but
arguably not all trauma survivors experience dissociation, or experience
it in the same way. This de facto requirement is also troublesome
insofar as the very same folks whose credibility is regularly questioned
as it is (i.e., women---especially trans women---of color, first and
foremost) are viewed as non-credible if they do not exhibit this
symptom. Further, even as dissociative and other traumatic symptomology
are conceptualized as ongoing and everyday in Herman's updated C-PTSD
model, they are still framed as ills that can be overcome,
rehabilitated, and even cured. And recovery here entails being able to
reconnect the disconnected parts of the dissociated (and unspeakable)
self, often through medicalized and individualized therapeutic
modalities. It is because of the inadequacies of this continued framing
of trauma as unspeakable, the centering of dissociation as the
categorically legitimate response to gendered and sexualized violence
(often evacuated of race, class, and nation), and an emphasis on
individualized recovery under neoliberalism, that I argue we must
reconsider and reformulate notions of feminized trauma. Attending to the
range of ways in which violence is meted out and experienced will help
us to listen to survivors without presuming their inability to
communicate. And this can help promote a new and politicized
understanding of trauma, and pave the way toward more just forms of
collective and communal care. 

My analysis moves between theoretical and conceptual registers and
discussions of various types of data (i.e., historical and contemporary
scientific discourse, tweets and other media-based accounts, and
autoethnographic narrative) and illustrates the type
of fracturing or falling apart that I describe as a legitimate trauma
response. Not fully dissociative, but a little all over the place.
Sometimes declarative, sometimes interrogative---at moments
"feral."[3](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-3) [[This]{.mark}
fractured [method suggests]{.mark} the [difficulty]{.mark} (but not
impossibility) [of **communicating everyday trauma**]{.mark}. It **is
[repetitive, fragmentary]{.mark},** and at times
**[frustrated]{.mark}**---a banal collage of dull anger and pain
(including anger at the silencing of so many others)]{.underline}.
Asking questions, I argue, can help open up space for radical
intervention and reframing. So when I ask questions, the intervention I
propose is, in part, enacted in the asking. This method is not only a
form of inquiry and interrogation but also of recognition---the
recognition that some things, some very important parts of the story,
have been missing and should be heard.

In the remainder of this essay, I argue that [even as we have moved
toward thinking of gendered and sexual violence and their traumatic
aftermaths as political and structural]{.underline} (and as
psychologists have gotten better at accounting for these types of
violence and their effects), [we still too often operate within a
reductive logic regarding femininity that is ultimately unjust insofar
as legitimate trauma becomes relegated to a certain demographic, and
only that type of trauma experience is legible as
suffering.]{.underline} Further problematic is that, [under this
prevailing logic, [the **type of feminine suffering that is most clearly
legible is that which follows from violences framed as
"exceptional"**]{.mark}]{.underline} (as opposed to the suffering of
those who are not victims of "stranger rape," incest, or abuse "at
home"). Most often, [survivors]{.underline} (even under Herman's
improved formulation) [are imagined to be white and wealthy or
middle-class]{.underline}---and their treatment is targeted as such.
Given all of this, I argue that we must responsibly ask: [**[What
symptoms might we observe]{.mark}** if and **[when]{.mark}** we
recognize that many **[traumatized folks do not have recourse to
diagnosis]{.mark}**, to **[treatment]{.mark}**, and, in some cases, do
not even have **[the time or space to dissociate]{.mark}**?]{.underline}
(Let alone to recover?)

In response to the historical and contemporary whitewashing,
cisheteronormativity, and class reductiveness of psychological
frameworks of feminized trauma, I re-theorize the symptomology and
sequelae of gendered and sexual violence alongside recent
conceptualizations of insidious
trauma,[4](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-4) crisis

slow
death.[9](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-9) With
an eye toward the liberation of groups whose experiences are often
minimized or blatantly ignored, I argue that traumatic symptomology such
as dissociation ought to be re-read through the lenses of critical
disability
studies[10](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-10) and,
more specifically,
crip-of-color[11](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-11) and
feminist-of-color disability
studies[12](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-12)---which
offer novel ways to consider the imbrication of minds, bodies, and the
social. These frames are oriented toward structural critique, and move
us beyond traditional formulations of the psychosomatic, bringing us
closer to an understanding of the environmental, relational, and often
traumatic constitution of bodyminds in the
world.[13](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-13) Such
an orientation is imperative in that it allows for deeper attention to
how race, class, citizenship, and other intersecting statuses contour
feminized trauma and symptoms across gendered populations.

An increased attention to multivalent structural inequities within
recent work coming out of disability studies is exciting and noteworthy.
However, disability studies has historically had its own problems with a
reductive and bourgeois whiteness. Thus, Black feminist theory's
attention to productions of gender, femininity, and sexual difference,
and to how these feel, necessarily helps reconceptualize feminized
trauma. Black women (and particularly Black trans women) tend to have
more frequent experiences of both macro traumas caused by clearly
identifiable forms of violence and the more mundane, banal, and gnawing
forms caused by everyday violations. I am informed by radical Black
feminist scholarship that considers Black feminism and Black femininity
as
affective,[14](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-14) as
felt, as lived---sometimes defensively (out of necessity and toward an
\[often obstructed\]
agency)[15](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-15)---in
everyday environments that are traumatizing and debilitating insofar as
they are saturated with racism, sexism, misogyny, and
misogynoir,[16](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-16) and
which condone and perpetuate Black unfreedom, violation, death, and harm
(and/or threats thereof). Audre Lorde and, more recently, Treva Ellison,
Amber Musser, Jennifer Nash, Sami Schalk, and C. Riley Snorton have
theorized how structural racialized and gendered violence contributes to
traumatic Black feminine subject formation. These scholars consider how
(sometimes negative) affects associated with Black femininity inhere in
subjects but are, in fact, produced within white supremacist,
colonialist, misogynistic, transphobic, and otherwise toxic environments
and relations wherein Black women are regularly injured---and then
expected to heal themselves.

Historically through today, dominant psycho-logics have perpetuated
racist, classist, and imperialist conceptualizations of femininity
itself.[17](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-17) Simone
Brown utilizes the concept white prototypicality to theorize the
racialized normativity of biometrics (such as fingerprinting and other
forms of
surveillance).[18](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-18) Elsewhere,
I have critiqued the ways that medical and scientific protocols both
depend on and simultaneously disavow feminized trauma as they attempt to
explain white feminine sexual "receptivity," "responsiveness," and
"discordance" in depoliticized behaviorist and evolutionary
terms.[19](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-19) Following
Browne and other Black feminist scholars cited above, in this essay I
consider how trauma frameworks are constituted within registers of
racial normativity---a type of white prototypicality that dwells within
the dominant psycho-logic for interpreting gendered and sexualized
trauma. Given this white prototypicality, I seek new ways to understand
feminized trauma experiences outside of both contemporary psychological
frameworks and traditional psychoanalytic conventions. I foreground
traumatic affects as they are lived at the level of raced, classed, and
gendered populations, while simultaneously reconceptualizing how traumas
are felt at the level of individual bodies and relationally among them.
My intervention is threefold:

First, I suggest that, [because sexual and gendered violence is directed
disparately]{.underline} (both quantitatively and qualitatively) [at
groups of femmes which are internally diverse, trauma responses also
necessarily look different across these populations. **[Feminized trauma
must]{.mark}** then **[be rethought]{.mark}**, particularly when
**[violence is slow, grating, cumulative,]{.mark} and disconcertingly
ordinary and [normalized to the point that it
is expected]{.mark}---**rather than posited as abnormal, exceptional,
and something that can be healed from individually.]{.underline}
Traditional psychological approaches to diagnosing and treating trauma
are not only limited to race-, class-, nation-, and gender-specific
subjects, but, in fact, produce and configure traumatized subjects as
only intelligible when they fit within these boundaries. 

Secondly, [once trauma]{.underline} (as it is experienced by many
feminized folk[) is reconceived as banal, mundane, and chronic, I open
up space for acknowledging, valuing, and centering a
traumatic dissociative-adjacent standpoint]{.underline} (or
sitpoint).[20](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-20) Absent
in mainstream psychological frameworks for interpreting feminized
trauma, this is an invaluable perspective on sexual and gendered
violence from which much can be learned. 

Finally, [within a disability justice
framework]{.underline},[[21](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-21) I
advocate that **[this traumatized femme perspective, epistemology,
and]{.mark}** form of **[knowledge]{.mark}**-**[production provides the
ground upon]{.mark}** which **[survivors]{.mark}** who live with raced,
classed, and gendered trauma can come together as they
**[enact]{.mark}** **[radical care]{.mark} in community [with each
other, fracturing and falling apart together]{.mark}**.]{.underline} My
analysis seeks to illuminate the full spectrum of feminized trauma
experience and amplify accounts rather than assuming unnarratibility. To
this end, the notion that [**[trauma is ontologically
unspeakable]{.mark}** must be called out for what it is---[a]{.mark}
form of **[silencing that is]{.mark} undoubtedly [structural and
political]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Women and femmes---and here they are
grouped together insofar as I am describing feminizing processes rather
than femme identities, per
se[22](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-22)---have
been silenced, including when they try to speak of their traumas (or
feel and register them outwardly, publicly). Creating space---and a
fleshy and affective language of sorts---to narrate endured violences is
part of an abolitionist justice project and can help to end expectations
of silence. I argue that this will offer a different type of healing, as
well, one that is not tied to individual rehabilitation, but which
instead allows fractured populations---both fractured from traumas (but
not fully split) and fractured along raced, classed, and gendered
lines---to stand in solidarity and feel differently (not "better" in the
vein of neoliberal productivity) together. With such a goal in mind, I
argue that even a C-PTSD-based therapy and analysis framework is
inadequate for fully attending to the insidious nature of everyday
traumas, and that instead, a crip theory of feminized
fracture or falling apart will help us move beyond the limitations of
both PTSD and C-PTSD and their treatment. [**[This affect-attendant,
justice-seeking, cripistemological orientation]{.mark}** to the
multiplicity of traumatic iterations **[counters previous myopic
formulations of trauma and its symptoms]{.mark}**, and empowers and
gives voice to those who are traumatized.]{.underline}

#### Hyper alertness creates a [threadbare]{.underline} life representative of an [unfinished]{.underline} psychic split that questions of vulnerability [never resolve]{.underline} -- the framing of violence as "resolvable" ignores the [ontological nature]{.underline} of sexual violence

Insofar as [[dissociation]{.mark} was]{.underline} often [[comorbid
with]{.underline}]{.mark} a diagnosis of [[hysteria]{.underline}]{.mark}
for early psychoanalysts like Freud and Josef Breuer, there is a long
history (or hystery) of [dissociation as feminized]{.underline}, or as
part of a sequelae of feminine neuroses. But if we take seriously that
women are more likely to dissociate, we must also follow the earliest
Freud and remember that this occurs so often in women (and here, I will
add femmes more broadly to update Freud's argument) due to their
disproportionate experiences of sexual violence and
abuse.[34](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-34) Today,
[women and femmes continue to be unduly violated, and trans women,
particularly Black trans women and other femmes of color, are
disproportionately likely to experience
violence]{.underline}---including sexual violence---during their
lives.[35](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-35) Further,
current research suggests that while 6.8% of the general adult
population in the United States report symptoms of PTSD, prevalence
estimates of trauma among trans folks range from 18% to 61%---and
according to recent studies, discrimination and assault associated
purely with being trans (rather than with exogenous experiences such as
sexual abuse) significantly amplify PTSD symptoms among transgender
folks.[36](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-36) [These
symptoms are, of course, exacerbated when intersecting experiences of
oppression are at play]{.underline}. Given these disparities in
proximity to trauma, and because we are in an age of ever-present yet
unspectacular harm, I argue that [we are]{.underline} also [in a moment
in which [it is **imperative to rethink structures of gender, race,
class, and nation as structures of feeling**]{.mark}
[37](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-37) which
are ontologically shaped by closeness to supremacist state
violence]{.underline}. It is time to reconceptualize sexual and gendered
trauma, the logic of dissociation, and the affective structure of
femininity itself.

[[If **part of living as**]{.mark} a femme-identified or femme-coded
individual]{.underline}---and particularly as [**[a Black woman or femme
of color---involves]{.mark}** living with **[apprehension]{.mark},
hyper-[alertness]{.mark}, and** the daily specter of **[anticipated
violence]{.mark}**, then **[how does this affect
symptomology]{.mark}?**]{.underline} What do symptoms look like when
they are the result of banal, chronic, slow violence? If they follow
from everyday, grey brutality and ordinary crises? What if there is a
detachment, but it is not a full rupture, and instead . . . fragmentary?
[Always bubbling up, but never completely coming to the surface, an
embodied-psychic stretching, to the point where the bodymind feels
threadbare . . . **[never]{.mark} [fully numb, but never fully]{.mark}
(or hyper-) [vigilant]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Maybe the
dissociative-adjacent symptom looks instead like anxiety, or it's akin
to brain
fog[38](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-38)---pervasive,
yet partial---or it's the perpetual feeling that you're about to fall
apart, to come unglued. [Maybe it's having a constant lump in your
throat, a racing heartbeat, and radiating tension while also feeling
utterly empty and dazed when you read the news, when you are out on the
street. Maybe **[the psychic split is never finished]{.mark}**---a
fracture, fleshed-over . . . **[semi-sutured]{.mark}** . . . **[but
never fully severed]{.mark}**? ]{.underline}

Not only might we ask what this shift to a new framework for trauma
symptomology looks like, how it presents, but also: what knowledge does
shifting from breaking / splitting to fracturing / falling apart make
possible? And legible? Feminine fracture then is both symptom and
standpoint/sitpoint. But if it is a standpoint/sitpoint, maybe it is
also a rallying point . . . and even a rallying
cry.[39](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-39) 

To begin this project of fleshing feminine fracture, [we might take the
experience of dissociative-adjacency as a point from which to
theorize.]{.underline} Returning again to early psychoanalysis, I
propose that we do this in the vein of Freud's and Breuer's notion of
hysteria as an altered state of consciousness, as, in fact, double
consciousness.[40](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-40) This
notion is particularly apt here as it shares many uncanny
epistemological and phenomenological assumptions with double
consciousness as it has been theorized by W. E. B. Du
Bois[41](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-41) and

Smith.[42](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-42) And
most usefully, Black feminist scholars such as Patricia Hill
Collins[43](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-43) and

and sexual violence is inextricable from racism and white
supremacy]{.underline}. How might we honor this feminized, racialized,
and classed experience while simultaneously taking care not to
essentialize or universalize it? How is a traumatic double consciousness
kindred with fracturing and falling apart? [**In our contemporary
climate of slow violence and crisis ordinariness, [how do these ways of
knowing, feeling, and living trauma manifest?]{.mark}** And how are they
contoured by difference---including the difference that race
makes?]{.underline}

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Latina trans activist
Lorena Borjas fell ill with the virus and passed away, leaving a deep
and painful void in her community. In a tribute to Borjas's life,
another NYC-based activist and writer, Cecilia Gentili, articulates a
type of feminized traumatic experience that feels chronic, heavy,
ossified, sedimented:

Many of us have been forsaken by our families, found ourselves homeless
and deprived of support from teachers, co-workers, and employers. We've
lived through extreme poverty---have made cohabitation with risk and
danger part of our normal. Transgender women of color---like she was,
like I am---know the uncertainty of taking each step as if it may be our
last. We know the weariness of walking under the weight of transphobia,
racism, and
misogyny.[48](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-48)

The burden described here might not be easy to recover from[; **[one
might]{.mark} be more likely to [feel as though she will fall apart
beneath it]{.mark}**. In order to get closer to
feeling/understanding/recognizing falling apart---**[an experience akin
to dissociation, derealization, and depersonalization]{.mark} but
[not]{.mark} quite [the]{.mark} [same thing]{.mark}**]{.underline}---I
propose that, [in addition to embracing a traumatic or hysterical double
consciousness, we work backward.]{.underline} Here, **[[a cripistemology
of]{.mark} [feminine fracturing]{.mark} or falling apart [has a kinship
with both double consciousness and feeling backward, which]{.mark} might
[involve an "embracing of loss and risking of
abjection]{.mark}]{.underline}**["]{.mark}[49](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-49)---and
deeply resonates with what Gentili describes above. [This kinship is
clear, in that a traumatic or hysterical double consciousness, feeling
backward, and feminine fracturing and falling apart all fuck with time
and space. They alter our perception, allow for altered perception, and
provide new forms of affective knowledge through altered perception, and
what it makes intelligible.]{.underline} This has direct import for
reconceptualizing trauma and its sequelae. Fracturing and falling apart,
alongside traumatic/hysterical double consciousness and feeling
backward, all expand how we interpret feminized trauma, as they are
standpoints/sitpoints which are explicitly
anti-chrononormative.[50](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/solidarity-falling-apart-toward-crip-collectivist-justice-theory-feminine-fracture-spurgas/#fn-9311-50) 

An imagined place of recovery can be a starting point from which to work
in order to better understand the experience of feminized
trauma---particularly insofar as the injury that is [feminized trauma
is, in part, constituted by the non-negotiable injunction to recover.
Recovery and rehabilitation are normative processes, which involve
taking individual action]{.underline}---but [**[trauma, as]{.mark}** it
is **[traditionally framed, is "paralyzing," even
"crippling."]{.mark}**]{.underline} So, once again, [we have a
paradox]{.underline}. But [**[if we conceive of paralysis and crippling
outside of this individualizing logic of recovery]{.mark}**, beyond the
logic of unnarratability, and instead as possible to speak about or feel
and even worth speaking about and feeling, and we do this alongside
others who are injured, then **[we may be able to get past this
seemingly insuperable foreclosure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thus, [feeling
backward, along with embracing traumatic double consciousness, are
central to understanding feminine fracturing as an alternative to
dissociation, and as an alternative to the conceptualization of trauma
as breach---as a break between a past and present self, or between a
body and a mind. **[This alternative]{.mark} framing also [exposes how
normative formulations of]{.mark} [gendered and sexualized
trauma]{.mark} have been [founded upon a specific vision of an innocent
and whole (]{.mark}white) [woman]{.mark}, who is then [damaged]{.mark}
and broken, [but]{.mark} who is [finally cured]{.mark} and can live
normally**]{.underline} (normatively) [again]{.underline}. [If we look
at the ways that traumatized people have been and continue to
be expected to recover, we can come closer to a cripistemology of
feminized fracture, and]{.underline} also [get outside of the white,
bourgeois, cishet femininity built into formulations of gendered and
sexualized trauma.]{.underline} Further, [[taking seriously how]{.mark}
diverse [feminized and traumatized]{.mark} [populations have been
expected to heal themselves allows us to consider]{.mark} more [communal
and radical ways of caring]{.mark} for each other.]{.underline}

### 2AC \-\-- Fem IR 

#### Only questions of [disability]{.underline} in IR can draw the genealogies of war-spaces such as Afghanistan into the broader question of a [racialized]{.underline} Fem IR

Alison **Howell 22** \[Feb 25 2022, Imagining Afghanistan in
Post-colonial IR: Feminism, Disability and Imperial Warfare,
<https://www.societyandspace.org/articles/imagining-afghanistan-in-post-colonial-ir-feminism-disability-and-imperial-warfare>,
Society and Space, -ekh\]

One clear starting point in apprehending the contributions of Imagining
Afghanistan is to heed Manchanda's alertness to the "**[[co-optation of
discourse]{.mark} \[analysis\] [as a depoliticized study of]{.mark}
[language, semantics, and rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (2020: 17)
that is, **[the [pacification and de-barbing of discourse analysis as a
methodology of (feminist) critique]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Imagining
Afghanistan instead develops its arguments concerning the racial-sexual
nature - and violent material consequences - of Anglophone imperial
knowledge production about Afghanistan by gathering an extensive and
divergent archive of source material: the book eschews a sole focus on
the 'easy targets' of George W Bush-era or military proclamations, to
instead trace not only the production but the circulation of discourse,
and in particular to consider the racial logics of Anglophone
constructions of Afghanistan across the political spectrum. 

So, for instance, we find rich discussion of the production of imperial
discourse by those strongly (even dynastically) associated with 'the
left' and with (white) feminism, such as the longtime Guardian columnist
Polly Toynbee (Manchanda 2020: 151). Yet the book also recognizes some
potential limitations to an intellectual and political orientation of
challenging Western/Anglophone constructions of Afghanistan, as it
acknowledges the potential critique (via discussion of Zia 2017) that a
"focus on Western constructions of Afghan women's oppression" might
"\[make\] it difficult for Afghan feminists to expose and arraign local
forms of patriarchy and the curtailment of the rights and agency that
these entail" (Manchanda 2020: 176; see also the Coda to the book).

Crucial here is that these kinds of engagements are illustrative of the
need to resist any temptation to comfortably conceptualize feminist IR
in terms of a binary reading of a homogenized 'white' versus a
homogenized 'other' feminism, when some of the most exciting debates in
feminist IR work through conversations and contentions between, for
example, divergent schools of postcolonial feminist, transnational
feminist, and anti-imperial and Third World feminist thought, with their
different emphases and methodologies for understanding colonial matrices
of power, imperial warfare, and resistance. In this sense, Imagining
Afghanistan raises urgent questions (without claiming to 'resolve' them
with finality) about whether challenging white-Western feminist canons
of knowledge risk re-centering them as objects of knowledge, and whether
there is room for multiple, sometimes contentious, avenues for imagining
and enacting feminism as an anti-imperial project.

Another way in which [feminists and others can read Imagining
**[Afghanistan]{.mark}** is to consider how it empirically
**[illustrates]{.mark}** that thinking about **[disability]{.mark}**
(**[studies]{.mark}**) [might **enrich**]{.mark} **our [accounts of war,
empire and global politics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While the book makes
scant reference to disability studies texts (containing some discussion
of Puar's 2017 The Right to Maim), [there are two notable sections of
the book that sit squarely in the realm of disability studies concerns:
the first (]{.underline}Manchanda 2020: 44-49) [examines **[the
"leitmotif" of "illness and disease,"]{.mark}** that is, the
**[persistent articulation of Afghanistan as a festering, cancerous,
pathological space in need of curative and
surgical]{.mark}**]{.underline} (read military)
[**[intervention]{.mark}**; the second]{.underline} (Manchanda 2020:
188-190) is [situated in the chapter on **[representations]{.mark}** [of
**Afghan masculinities**]{.mark}, and unpicks the figure of [**the**
"**Mentally Unstable Taliban**]{.mark}." ]{.underline}

Such empirical concerns, and the book's brief engagement with some
recent literature located as interventions in disability studies opens
productive space for thinking about imperial warfare from a decolonial
disability studies perspective. [Despite[ the
whiteness](https://asylummagazine.org/2013/12/mad-people-of-color-a-manifesto-by-rachel-gorman-annu-saini-louise-tam-onyinyechukwu-udegbe-onar-usar/) of,
and historical focus on the Global North in, disability
studies]{.underline} (cf. Bell 2006; Gorman et al. 2013; Miles, Nishida
and Forber-Pratt 2017), like feminist IR, [there are many worlds of
disability scholarship and activism, including parallel genealogies of
anti-imperial and anti-racist work that treat [ableism as integrally
enmeshed with
racism](https://www.talilalewis.com/blog/why-i-dont-use-anti-black-ableism)]{.underline} (cf.
Meerai, Abdillahi, and Poole 2016; Pickens 2019). [Established and
growing research in this field has been shaped by an acknowledgement of
**[the need to decolonize disability studies and firmly place disability
in global and colonial contexts]{.mark}**]{.underline} (cf. Erevelles
2011; Meekosha 2011; Grech 2015; Grech and Soldatic 2016), [as the field
has examined the imbrications of racism and ableism in a number of areas
of empirical **concern to** global studies, including for example:
[**migration** and **detention**]{.mark}]{.underline} (cf. Joseph 2015;
Tam 2017), **[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}** (cf. Cosgrove et al.),
**[[the arms trade]{.underline}]{.mark}** (cf. Meekosha 2011), **[[and
war and militarism]{.underline}]{.mark}** (cf. Wool 2015).
Like Imagining Afghanistan, some of the work emerging from this field
has entailed researching how colonial knowledge and imperial violence
are produced through racist and ableist registers of madness and
deviance, especially the pathologization of the figures of the terrorist
or insurgent (cf. Howell 2007; Patel 2014; Rai 2006).

[One of the highly productive tensions emerging out of these literatures
concerns how to situate research focusing on the
representational/discursive in relation to efforts [to **decolonize
disability studies**]{.mark} **in ways that [foreground how enslavement,
land theft, and colonial warfare]{.mark} have been and [continue to be
productive of mass impairment and debility]{.mark}**]{.underline} (cf.
Meekosha 2011; Grech 2015; Puar 2017). [This latter move may press on
understandings of disability as a basis for political identity,
community and collective action]{.underline} (sometimes organized
through the concept of 'Pride'). Put differently: **[[how can]{.mark}
the [bodily devastation]{.mark} of colonialism and imperialism [be
captured as a disability issue, without casting racialized
disabled]{.mark} [people]{.mark} or disabled people [in the Global
South]{.mark} [as pitiable victims lacking agency]{.mark}, or [without
reifying representations as a function of deconstructing
them?]{.mark} ]{.underline}**

One answer has been to [highlight shared collective political
struggles]{.underline}, for example by recognizing attempts to
disqualify colonized peoples from self-determination and sovereignty on
the basis of the production of racial hierarchies of mental capacity,
intelligence, maturity and (sexual) deviance (cf. Bruce 2017), or
political activism and scholarship that highlights shared but divergent
histories of incarceration (i.e. penal incarceration and disability
incarceration in institutions or by 'chemical incarceration') and of
abolitionist activism (cf. Ben-Moshe 2020; Carey Chapman and Ben-Moshe
2014; Fabris 2011).

To begin to think through how these [literatures might come into
conversation with Imagining Afghanistan, we might start by acknowledging
that what's at stake in taking this scholarship seriously is
not,]{.underline} as Manchanda warns, [to adopt a "mantra of race, class
and gender"]{.underline} (Manchanda 2020: 183) [to which 'disability'
could be 'added,' but rather recognize that "\[s\]ocial difference is
messy, uneven and ambivalent." Put differently, this is not about
cataloguing a more complete list of 'isms', but about fostering a more
conceptually and empirically robust field of imperial war
studies. ]{.underline}

Bringing Imagining Afghanistan into conversation with these disability
studies literatures pushes us to consider, for example, [**[the
relations between]{.mark}** colonial tropes of **[the Taliban 'warlord'
as mentally unstable and as sexually deviant,]{.mark}**]{.underline}
topics which are treated sequentially in the book (chapter 5). [**Such
[tropes of madness and deviance are not new]{.mark}**, and can be
situated amidst a long history of misogynist and racist psychiatric
knowledge and practice in settler and other colonial spaces. It is
noteworthy that precisely where Imagining Afghanistan shifts gears from
the discursive or "metaphoric to the literal" (]{.underline}Manchanda
2020: 48) [is in the discussion of representations of Afghanistan as a
diseased and pathological space, where the direct relations between
drone warfare, CIA activity and elevated polio rates are
discussed.]{.underline} **[[This suggests natural lines of affinity
with]{.mark} the kinds of [disability studies scholarship that]{.mark}
view [colonization through]{.mark} the lens of [the production of
impairment]{.mark}, while [opening space to highlight agency and
resistance to war and other]{.mark} [forms]{.mark} [of
correction-through-violence]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Read through and against these political and scholarly
contexts, Imagining Afghanistan points to exciting common touchstones
across these fields of inquiry, suggestive of ways to significantly push
forward the fields of critical and postcolonial war studies, and to
better grapple with all of the complexities of imperial warfare.

## Queerness 

### 2AC \-\-- Perm 

#### **Both queer and disabled communities have been forced to become "normal", and this shared history makes the two intertwined in their suffering.**

**Sandahl 03** (Carrie Sandahl an associate professor in the Department
of Disability and Human Development at the University of Illinois at
Chicago, "QUEERING THE CRIP OR CRIPPING THE QUEER? Intersections of
Queer and Crip Identities in Solo Autobiographical Performance"

As academic corollaries of minority civil rights movements, [[queer
theory and disability]{.mark}]{.underline} studies both have origins in
and ongoing commitments to activism. Their primary constituencies,
sexual minorities and people with disabilities, [[share a history of
injustice]{.mark}: both have been pathologized by medicine; demonized by
religion; discriminated against in housing, employment, and education;
stereotyped in representation; victimized by hate groups; and isolated
socially, often in their families of origin]{.underline}. Both
constituencies are diverse in terms of race, class, gender, sexuality,
religion, political affiliation, and other respects and therefore share
many members (e.g., those who are disabled and gay), as well as allies.
Both have self-consciously created their own enclaves and vibrant
subcultural practices. [[Perhaps the most significant similarity between
these disciplines,]{.mark} however[, is their radical stance toward
concepts of normalcy; both argue adamantly against the compulsion to
observe norms of all kind]{.mark}s]{.underline} (corporeal, mental,
sexual, social, cultural, subcultural, etc.). This stance may even be
considered their raison d'être, since both emerged from critiques levied
against the normalizing tendencies of their antecedents.4 Queer
theorists critiqued feminist, gay and lesbian, and even gender studies
for excluding various sexual constituents (transsexuals, bisexuals,
transgendered people, S/M practitioners, nonheteronormative straights,
etc.) and for advocating inclusion and representation in, rather than
replacement of, existing social structures. Disability scholars
critiqued the fact that disability had long been relegated to academic
disciplines (primarily medicine, social sciences, and social services)
that considered disabilities "problems" to be cured and the disabled
"defectives" to be normalized, not a minority group with its own
politics, culture, and history. Because of these similarities, it may
seem that disability studies has little to add to queer theory, and vice
versa; indeed, some may assume that disability studies is a subset of
queer theory. Consider, for example, how the term queer has been defined
by some of its proponents. In The Queer Renaissance Robert McRuer
describes queer as a fluid designation for
[[identities]{.mark}]{.underline} that ["[are shaped and reshaped across
differences and that interrogate and disrupt dominant hierarchical
understandings of not only sex, gender, and sexuality but also race and
class.]{.mark}"]{.underline}5 I think that McRuer would agree to adding
disability to that list. Michael Warner, in Fear of a Queer Planet,
argues for an even broader definition: "The preference for 'queer'
represents, among other things, an aggressive impulse of generalization;
it rejects a minoritizing logic of toleration or simple political
interest-representation in favor of a more thorough resistance to
regimes of the normal."6 Disability studies' stance against "regimes of
the normal" may appear to be more of the same; as Judith Butler argues
in Bodies That Matter, the term queer, rather than describing a specific
identity, can be considered "a site of collective contestation . . . the
point of departure for a set of historical reflections and futural
imaginings." Thus it must "remain that which is, in the present, never
fully owned, but always and only redeployed, twisted, queered from a
prior usage and in the direction of urgent and expanding political
purposes."7 Because disability civil rights could be considered just
such an urgent political purpose, one might assume that queer could be
redeployed in its service. Moreover, [[the term cripple, like queer, is
fluid and ever-changing]{.mark}, claimed by those whom it did not
originally define]{.underline}. As a pejorative, [the term queer was
originally targeted at gays and lesbians, yet its rearticulation as a
term of pride is currently claimed by those who may not consider
themselves homosexual, such as the transgendered, transsexuals,
heterosexual sex radicals, and others. The term crip has expanded to
include not only those with physical impairments but those with sensory
or mental impairments as well]{.underline}. Though I have never heard a
nondisabled person seriously claim to be crip (as heterosexuals have
claimed to be queer), I would not be surprised by this practice. [[The
fluidity of both terms makes it likely that their boundaries will
dissolve.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### 2AC \-\-- Link Turn 

#### The terms "queer" and "crip" are inherently connected, due to their shared history of change and their past of being used for harm. Reclaiming the words can help move forward with deconstructing the systems of discrimination that have oppressed groups of people for centuries.

The power of these performances lies in their ability to assert pride
while drawing the audience's attention to the political and social
issues of being crip and queer[. Along with asserting
pride]{.underline}, Clare maintains, [comes the responsibility of
"bearing witness": Both [witness and pride strengthen identity, foster
resistance, cultivate subversion. . . .]{.mark} Yet [we also need to
remember that witness and pride are not the same.]{.mark} [Witness pairs
grief and rage with remembrance. Pride pairs joy with a determination to
be visible.]{.mark} Witness demands primary adherence to and respect for
history. Pride uses history as one of its many tools. Sometimes witness
and pride work in concert, other times not. [We cannot afford to
confuse]{.mark}, merge, blur [the two]{.mark}.57 We must not forget that
[even as we appropriate the terms queer and cripple, they retain the
taint of their power to injure]{.mark}. This taint provides the fuel for
a rearticulation.]{.underline}58 As an act of witnessing, solo
performance reminds audiences of the crucial social and political work
that needs to be done. [Queer crips also challenge audiences by raising
questions about intragroup dynamics]{.underline} as well as the
alliances [between queers and cripples]{.underline}. Galloway points out
that everyday disability performances are crafted not only for the
nondisabled but also for insiders: QUEER AND CRIP IDENTITIES IN SOLO
AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL PERFORMANCE 49 At the end of the summer was award night
\[at the cripple camp\]. . . . You had this steady stream of kids going
up to the stage to get their awards. But I was the only kid who was
mobile. . . . these were kids without legs, kids with artificial legs,
kids on crutches, kids in braces, kids in wheelchairs, in wheeled beds,
kids drawn there by pulleys. So when it came time for me to accept my
award, I limped all the way up to the stage. As I limped back---on the
other leg---I was thinking, even with all the paraphernalia making my
handicaps visible---among those kids I'd just never be handicapped
enough.59 With this story Galloway uses humor to critique the crip
community's often divisive, painful hierarchy of disability identities[.
Neither crip culture nor queer culture offers utopian spaces free from
the need to perform stigma management.]{.underline}

## Pomo 

### 2AC \-\-- Perm do both 

#### Perm do both - resolves the link using postmoderist body as a tool of disability studies, we know the creation of the body is not perfect but when combined with disability studies it goes beyond the incomplete theorizing of the body 

**Samuels 2002** (Ellen Samuels, NWSA Journal , Autumn, 2002, Vol. 14,
No. 3, Feminist Disability Studies "Judith Butler\'s Body Theory and the
Question of Disability (Autumn, 2002), pp. 58-76, Published by: The
Johns Hopkins University Press, <https://www.jstor.org/stable/4316924> ,
Transcribed via OCR) // RB

One reading of Butler would suggest that her sustained concern with the
normative criteria that form legible, bounded, human bodies versus
illegible, uncontrolled, inhuman bodies attempts to recuperate sexuality
at the expense of disability. By exposing and explicating the cultural
pro cesses at work, Butler aims to demonstrate the unfixed and
constructed nature of sexuality/gender, thus destabilizing the hierarchy
of normal. (hetero) vs. abnormal (homo) forms. However, in doing so she
must necessarily acknowledge and discursively materialize a realm of
abnormal bodies, only to rescue queer bodies from inside it. But what
remains? Some clues are offered in Butler\'s discussion of Freudian
hypochondria, in which the physically ill body emerges as the product of
inappropriately abjected sexuality, forced into psychosomatic emergence
through socio psychological prohibition (1993, 58-64). The ill body and
the homosexual body emerge, in Butler\'s paradigm, as ontological
opposites whose co existence is the product of oppressive social
schemas. It naturally follows for Butler to oppose the \"metaphorics of
illness that pervade the description of sexuality,\" especially in the
context of AIDS and the subsequent re-pathologization of homosexuality
(64). To question Butler on this point is not to endorse the
pathologization of gayness, or to imply that queer and ill/disabled
bodies have any natural or presumed commonalties. It is, however, to
point out that Butler\'s liberatory approach to sexuality takes as a
matter of course that \"metaphorics of illness\" are always negative,
and that somewhere, somehow, bodies do exist which deserve patholo
gization based upon the very material, biological \"realities\" which
she seeks to destabilize.

Mitchell and Snyder describe this problem as the \"representational
double bind of disability\" in which, \"while disabled populations are
firmly entrenched on the outer margins of social power and cultural
value, the disabled body also serves as the raw material out of which
other socially disempowered communities make themselves visible\" (1997,
6). Thus, \"any attempt to distance disenfranchised communities from the
fantasy of deformity further entrenches the disabled as the \'real\'
abnor mality from which all other nonnormative groups must be
distanced\" (6). This \"double bind\" also emerges in Thomson\'s
critique, cited earlier, of feminist theories that attempt to
de-pathologize the normative female body at the expense of the
physically deviant or ill body. While Mitchell, Snyder, and Thomson
focus their critique of postmodern body theory on the reliance of that
theory upon the disabled body as a constitutive Other, [Susan Wendell is
concerned that postmodern theories focus too exclu sively upon the
body-as-construction and thus elide the lived experience of \"actual\"
bodies, particularly the \"negative body,\" i.e., the body which is
disabled, ill, or suffering (1996, 166-8).]{.underline}

We can see in Butler\'s work many examples of such apparently \"dis
embodied bodies.\" In particular, body parts separated from their
original, intact bodies populate Butler\'s work in a strangely
impersonal fashion that certainly seems divorced from any literally
fragmented bodies, i.e., amputees, congenitally \"deformed\" persons,
etc. To elucidate her idea of the imagined phallus vs. the physical
penis[,]{.underline} Butler extends Freudian theory on hypochondria to
suggest that the \"ambiguity between a real and conjured pain. . . is
sustained in the analogy with eratogenecity, which seems defined as the
very vacillation between real and imagined. body parts\" (1993, 59).
This idea is then extended to include the Lacanian \"partitioned body,\"
\"the body \'in pieces\' before the mirror\" which comes to stand for
the whole, thus creating a \"phantasm of control\" (80). These concepts
form the basis for Butler\'s analysis of Willa Cather\'s fiction, in
which, she claims, \"body parts disengage from any common center, pull
away from each other, lead separate lives, become sites of phantasmic
investments that refuse to reduce to singular sexualities\" (140). As in
Cho\'s essay discussed above, the disabled body becomes a disinvested.
symbolic medium for the display and mediation of sexuality, which then
apparently constitutes the \"real\" and primary subjectivity. In
addition, the fragmented body parts littering the landscape are so
firmly located within the imaginary that it is not even necessary for
Butler to clarify at any point that she is not talking about actual
bodies, that no characters in Cather\'s fiction suffer the loss of
limbs, etc. Yet, once versed in the rudiments of the social construction
of disability, one cannot help but perceive the incompleteness of
Butler\'s argument, as \"the disabled body is a direct imago of the
repressed fragmented body. The disabled body. causes a kind of
hallucination of the mirror phase gone wrong\" (Davis 1995, 139).

[Not only disability studies scholars have challenged Butler for her eli
sion of the lived experience of the physical body. Butler tells us that
she wrote Bodies That Matter in part to respond to such critiques of
Gender Trouble, which she parrots into her introduction in the form of
the oft repeated question : \"What about the materiality of the body,
Judy?\" (1993, ix). Her consistent response is that, of course, she is
not arguing that bodies or gender are only constructions, but that
construction is an inte gral part of their being, and thus must be
elucidated :]{.underline}

[For surely bodies live and die; eat and sleep; feel pain, pleasure;
endure illness and violence; and these \"facts\" one might skeptically
proclaim, cannot be dismissed as mere constructions. Surely there must
be some kind of necessity that accompanies these primary and irrefutable
experiences. And surely there is. But their irrefutability in no way
implies what it might mean to affirm them and through what discursive
means. (xi)]{.underline}

[Butler\'s point is well taken, but so are those of her
critics]{.underline}. The concerns of disability studies scholars such
as Wendell who worry about \"approaches to cultural construction of
\'the body\' that \... deny or ignore bodily expe rience in favor of
fascination with bodily representations\" echo those of some transgender
activists regarding pomo gender theory (1996, 44). In her book Read My
Lips, Riki Ann Wilchins (1997), co-founder of the political action group
Transexual Menace, robustly critiques the aca demic field of gender
studies as a voyeuristic anthropology of transgen der experience. Gender
studies in the academy, says Wilchins, too often \"escalate\[s\] the
politicization of our bodies, choices, and desires, so that, with each
new book, while their audience enjoys the illusion of knowing more about
us, we find ourselves more disempowered, disembodied, and exploited than
before\" (22). Wilchins cites the extremely high incidence of physical
violence and abuse in transpeople\'s lives, as well as their pain ful
struggles for self-determination, and then notes \"you won\'t find any
of this in the next trans or gender studies book because the real
challenges of our lives aren\'t perceived as relevant. \... It is far
easier to invest us as a topic of study than the depredations of the
gender regime that marginal izes and preys upon us\" (24).

[This critique is powerful and necessary]{.underline}, yet it jibes
oddly with Wil chins\'s citations of Butler and Foucault in her book,
and her description of Butler\'s Gender Trouble as \"the most
far-reaching and penetrating critique of feminism, sexuality, and binary
sex from a postmodern view point to date\" (224). One can reasonably be
left confused as to Wilchins\'s ultimate feelings about gender theory in
general, and Butler in particu lar. [Yet, **[perhaps her contradictory
attitude can actually provide a useful model for disability theorists as
we begin to formulate more nuanced and liberatory ways to integrate
Butler and her fellow constructivists into our own
scholarship]{.mark}**. I find a very similar moment in Carrie Sandahl\'s
wonderfully unresolved interrogation of her own attempt to deconstruct
both disability and femininity while directing a production of Joan
Schenkar\'s play Signs of Life. Like other critics of postmodern body
theory, Sandahl observes that \"[Butler\'s theory of performativity\...
relies on a metaphori cal association between gender \'freakishness\'
and deformed bodies. In a sense, then, Butler uses disability (or the
deformed, abject body) as a metaphor for gender and sex difference, and
. . . ignores the identities and concerns of actual people with
disabilities\" (1999]{.mark}, 15).]{.underline} Yet on the very next
page, [[Sandahl decides to use Butler anyway, because \"**Butler\'s
theory\... allows us to see the performative parallel between gender and
disability**]{.mark}\" (16). It seems that [Butler\'s work exerts a
powerful influence, not only on our academic discourse, but perhaps also
on our minds and hearts. Her insights have the potential to be so
far-reaching and liberatory that even as we formulate critiques of her
theories, we are also drawn in to the possibilities those theories
offer.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Conclusion : Can\'t Think with Her, Can\'t Think Without Her

\[W\]riting the disabled body will mean that our most basic conceptions
of the body will need to be rewritten\.... Like the normative ideologies
of the body to which they often stand opposed, theoretical discourses of
the body already contain within themselves a series of unacknowledged
and/or disavowed assumptions and theories about disability. Bringing
these out for inspection is one way that body theory can begin to learn
something from disability stud ies and can intervene in them in turn.
-James I. Porter (1997, xiv)

Ju[dith [Butler\'s theories have already had a wide and far-reaching
influ ence on contemporary critical work on the body, gender, sexuality,
and identity. Disability studies scholars cannot,]{.mark} I think,
afford to [ignore or dismiss Butler\'s work]{.mark}-but neither should
we adopt it uncritically.]{.underline} [As I have suggested, merely
inserting disability into the mix without thor oughly examining the
meaning and implications of the new ideas we thus create is not only
inaccurate, but falls short of pushing Butler\'s work the necessary next
step to fully account for the not-always-able body. Such wholesale
adoptions treat Butler\'s theories as more fixed and final than even
she, with her emphasis on unfixed, ever-shifting, and irreduc ible
meanings, would likely endorse.]{.underline} [There is no ideal
blueprint of how future work in disability studies should integrate
Butler\'s theories, and I won\'t pretend to offer one.]{.underline} [But
ultimately the groundbreaking nature of [**Butler\'s work means that it
represents the first steps of a new body of thought that will
necessarily become more nuanced, comprehensive, and accountable as it
grows with time,** and I believe that **disability studies must and
should be an active participant in that growth-not only to enhance our
own work, but to provide the necessary apparatus to evolve those
theories beyond their original limitations**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [As
postmodern body theory and disability theory continue to develop and
expand, they are certain to pursue parallel, if not corresponding,
tracks : I have already noted that, as our understanding of disability
as visually constructed has begun to evolve toward a more complex
analysis of the role of language in forming discursive bodily
identities, Butler has also moved from focusing upon the performativity
of the body to inquire more deeply into the ways in which \"language
sustains the body\" (1997, 5). Critics such as Mairian Corker develop
this parallel to its logical and fruitful next step by integrating
Butler\'s insights with a disability framework (1999; 2001). But this
integration will have limited success if it works in only one direction.
So I would like to end on a note of challenge [to all body-theorists
working within Butler\'s framework (not to mention Butler herself) to
**include and account for the disabled body in your work**, not as a
metaphor or sign for gender, but in all its real complexity. Only then
can we begin to cross our divide.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[One reading of [Butler]{.mark} would suggest that her [sustained
concern with the normative criteria that form legible, bounded, human
bodies versus illegible,]{.mark} uncontrolled, inhuman bodies attempts
to recuperate sexuality at the expense of disability. By exposing and
explicating the cultural pro cesses at work, Butler aims to demonstrate
the unfixed and constructed nature of sexuality/gender, thus
destabilizing the hierarchy of normal]{.underline}. (hetero) vs.
abnormal (homo) forms. However, in doing so [she must necessarily
acknowledge and discursively materialize a realm of abnormal bodies,
only to rescue queer bodies from inside it.]{.underline} But what
remains? Some clues are offered in Butler\'s discussion of Freudian
hypochondria, in which the physically ill body emerges as the product of
inappropriately abjected sexuality, forced into psychosomatic emergence
through socio psychological prohibition (1993, 58-64). [The ill body and
the homosexual body emerge, in Butler\'s paradigm, as ontological
opposites whose co existence is the product of oppressive social
schemas. It naturally follows for Butler to oppose the \"metaphorics of
illness that pervade the description of sexuality,\" especially in the
context of AIDS and the subsequent re-pathologization of
homosexuality]{.underline} (64). [To question Butler on this point is
not to endorse the pathologization of gayness, or to imply that queer
and ill/disabled bodies have any natural or presumed commonalties. It
is, however, to point out that **But[ler\'s liberatory approach to
sexuality takes as a matter of course that \"metaphorics of illness\"
are always negative]{.mark},** and that somewhere, somehow, [bodies do
exist which deserve patholo gization based upon the very material,
biological \"realities\" which she seeks to
destabilize.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Mitchell and Snyder describe this problem as the \"[representational
double bind of disability]{.mark}\" in which, \"while [disabled]{.mark}
[populations]{.mark} are [firmly entrenched on the outer margins of
social power and cultural value,]{.mark} the [disabled body also serves
as the raw material out of which other socially disempowered communities
make themselves visible\"]{.mark}]{.underline} (1997, 6). Thus, [\"any
attempt to distance disenfranchised communities from the fantasy of
deformity further entrenches the disabled as the \'real\' abnor mality
from which all other nonnormative groups must be distanced\" (6). This
\"[double bind]{.mark}\" also emerges in Thomson\'s critique, cited
earlier, of **[feminist theories that attempt to de-pathologize the
normative female body at the expense of the physically deviant or ill
body]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While Mitchell, Snyder, and Thomson focus
their critique of postmodern body theory on the reliance of that theory
upon the disabled body as a constitutive Other, [Susan Wendell is
concerned that [postmodern theories focus too exclu sively upon the
body-as-construction]{.mark} and thus [elide]{.mark} the [lived]{.mark}
[experience]{.mark} [of]{.mark} \"actual\" bodies, particularly the
\"[negative body,\" i.e., the body which is disabled, ill, or
suffering]{.mark} (1996, 166-8).]{.underline}

[We can see in Butler\'s work many examples of such apparently \"dis
embodied bodies.\" In particular, body parts separated from their
original, intact bodies populate Butler\'s work in a strangely
impersonal fashion that certainly seems divorced from any literally
fragmented bodies, i.e., amputees, congenitally \"deformed\" persons,
etc.]{.underline} To elucidate her idea of the imagined phallus vs. the
physical penis[, Butler extends Freudian theory on hypochondria to
suggest that the \"ambiguity between a real and conjured pain. . . is
sustained in the analogy with eratogenecity, which seems defined as the
very vacillation between real and imagined. body parts\"
(1993]{.underline}, 59). [This idea is then extended to include the
Lacanian \"partitioned body,\" \"the body \'in pieces\' before the
mirror\" which comes to stand for the whole, thus creating a \"phantasm
of control]{.underline}\" (80). These concepts form the basis for
Butler\'s analysis of Willa Cather\'s fiction, in which, [she claims,
\"body parts disengage from any common center, pull away from each
other, lead separate lives, become sites of phantasmic investments that
refuse to reduce to singular sexualities\"]{.underline} (140). As [in
Cho\'s essay discussed above, the [**disabled body** **becomes a
disinvested. symbolic medium for the display and mediation of sexuality,
which then apparently constitutes the \"real\" and primary
subjectivity**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [In addition, the fragmented body
parts littering the landscape are so firmly located within the imaginary
that it is not even necessary for Butler to clarify at any point that
she is not talking about actual bodies, that no characters in Cather\'s
fiction suffer the loss of limbs, etc.]{.underline} [Yet, once versed in
the rudiments of the social construction of disability, one cannot help
but perceive the incompleteness of Butler\'s argument, as \"the disabled
body is a direct imago of the repressed fragmented body. The disabled
body. causes a kind of hallucination of the mirror phase gone
wrong\"]{.underline} (Davis 1995, 139).

[Not only disability studies scholars have challenged [Butler for her
eli sion of the lived experience of the physical body]{.mark}. Butler
tells us that she wrote Bodies That Matter in part to respond to such
critiques of Gender Trouble, which she parrots into her introduction in
the form of the oft repeated question : \"What about the materiality of
the body, Judy?\" (1993, ix). Her consistent response is that, of
course, she is not arguing that bodies or gender are only constructions,
but that construction is an inte gral part of their being, and thus must
be elucidated :]{.underline}

For surely bodies live and die; eat and sleep; feel pain, pleasure;
endure illness and violence; and these \"facts\" one might skeptically
proclaim, cannot be dismissed as mere constructions. Surely there must
be some kind of necessity that accompanies these primary and irrefutable
experiences. And surely there is. But their irrefutability in no way
implies what it might mean to affirm them and through what discursive
means. (xi)

Butler\'s point is well taken, but so are those of her critics. [The
concerns of disability studies scholars such as Wendell who worry about
\"[approaches to cultural construction of \'the body\' that \... deny or
ignore bodily expe rience in favor of fascination with bodily
representations\"]{.mark}]{.underline} [echo those of some transgender
activists regarding pomo gender theory]{.underline} (1996, 44). In her
book Read My Lips, Riki Ann Wilchins (1997), co-founder of the political
action group Transexual Menace, [robustly critiques the aca demic field
of gender studies as a voyeuristic anthropology of transgen der
experience. Gender studies in the academy, says [Wilchins]{.mark}, too
often \"[escalate\[s\] the politicization of our bodies, choices, and
desires, so that, with each new book, while their **audience enjoys the
illusion of knowing more about us, we find ourselves more disempowered,
disembodied, and exploited than before**\"]{.mark}]{.underline} (22).
[Wilchins cites the extremely high incidence of physical violence and
abuse in transpeople\'s lives, as well as their pain ful struggles for
self-determination, and then notes \"you won\'t find any of this in the
next trans or gender studies book because the real challenges of our
lives aren\'t perceived as relevant. \... It is far easier to invest us
as a topic of study than the depredations of the gender regime that
marginal izes and preys upon us\" (24).]{.underline}

[This critique is powerful and necessary]{.underline}, yet it jibes
oddly with Wil chins\'s citations of Butler and Foucault in her book,
and her description of Butler\'s Gender Trouble as \"the most
far-reaching and penetrating critique of feminism, sexuality, and binary
sex from a postmodern view point to date\" (224). One can reasonably be
left confused as to Wilchins\'s ultimate feelings about gender theory in

### 2AC \-\-- Afrofuturism turn

#### Disability is key to understanding what makes black people non-human under white supremacy. Retheorizing Afrofuturism through the lens of the black disabled cyborg can tell the story of how blackness overcame antiblack violence, accounting for its multifaceted presence in the future.

Last year, my queer platonic partner gifted me the graphic novel version
of Octavia Butler's Kindred. For us, this gift served as the meeting
place of our passions---a book that bridges her love of comics and
graphic novels with my love of gut-wrenching, meaty speculative fiction.
Upon receipt, I made an effort to read the novel before reading the
graphic novel to see the translation of prose to imagery. PhD life took
over though, and instead of finishing the novel first, I found myself
curled up one evening carefully making my way through Damian Duffy and
John Jennings's graphic novel adaptation. Reading the graphic novel
adaptation of Kindred was nothing short of difficult for me. Watching
Dana's evolution from subject to circumstance to active abolitionist
reminded me of watching Cicely Tyson's tour de force performance in "A
Woman Called Moses" as a child. "A Woman Called Moses" is a biographical
TV movie chronicling Harriet Tubman's journey to founding the
Underground Railroad. [In both Kindred and "A Woman Called Moses," the
disablement of black women's bodies is central to the plotline as Dana
and Harriet endure acts of physical violence at the hands of their slave
masters.]{.underline} [Experiencing the disabling effects of bondage are
the catalysts that propel both Harriet and Dana to seek liberation---for
themselves and others. Through Dana and Harriet's perspectives, both
narratives reimagine life during antebellum slavery, particularly the
possibilities and difficulties associated with liberation from
bondage]{.underline}. [[Reimagining presents a language of
fugitivity]{.mark}---freedom from antiblack violence and the spectre of
white supremacy that looms over both plantations Dana and Moses are
entrenched in. Yet for all the speculative possibilities these stories
present, I realized [a language about disability is largely absent from
what it means to seek liberation from bondage]{.mark}, despite its
centrality to both stories]{.underline}. By and large, Kindred and "A
Woman Called Moses" are not discussed as slave narratives whose
protagonists are explicitly named as disabled black women.
[Subsequently, the [disablement]{.mark} Dana and Harriet endure
[is]{.mark} often [belted]{.mark} [under]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[frame]{.mark} [of antiblack violence]{.mark} [as an explanation as to
why they sought freedom from bondage]{.mark}, [but not what it means for
disabled black women to be architects of
fugitivity]{.mark}]{.underline}. [When disability is named, it is
usually done by black disabled folks who are trying to assert
[disability as integral to the terrain of black
struggle]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Such a reluctance to explicitly name
Dana, Harriet, and other figures of slave narratives as disabled not
only highlights the absence of a language around disability and
afrofuturism, but the implications of such silences in terms of how the
future is envisioned as a space of black liberation]{.underline}. [So
much of [afrofuturism's]{.mark} liberatory potency and [radical]{.mark}
[imagination]{.mark} [comes from the ability of black people to be the
architects of their own futurity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Florence Oyeke
says as much when she suggests that, "[afrofuturism dares to suggest
that not only will black people exist in the future, but that we will be
makers and shapers of it, too]{.underline}." [One way black futures are
crafted is [through]{.mark} [declaration]{.mark}: the act of naming the
existence of black people in the future, the roadmap to which is charted
in afrofuturist works. An example of this is Alisha B. Wormsley's
billboard declaration, "there are black people in the future." This
declaration was born out of frustration not only from noticing the
absence of nonwhite faces in science fiction films and television shows,
but also the rapid demise of the black American
neighborhood.]{.underline} Both Oyeke and Wormsley demonstrate the power
of naming within the afrofuturist imagination, its significance in
shaping the terrain of possibility. Naming a future that's free from
different manifestations of antiblack violence means determining a
different relationship with time. Temporal difference not only shapes
the creation of narratives, but also the body-minds at the center of
those narratives---what body-minds exist in the future and the stories
told about their becoming. [[Representations of afrofuturist body-minds
are very much a function of what people desire to make visible,]{.mark}
absent, or marginal within the schema of narrative construction. It's
often when I encounter body-minds in afrofuturist works that I'm left
wondering about the shaky existence of black disabled body-minds in
afrofuturism and the general absence of language around
disability.]{.underline} Too often I look at what constitutes a
body-mind in the afrofuturist imaginary and am left wondering, "[[which
black people are in the future]{.underline}?"]{.mark} Take, for example,
the prevalence of the posthuman in afrofuturism. On the one hand, there
is the posthuman cyborg, most famously Janelle Monae's alter ego Cindi
Mayweather. [[Monae's android persona is an example of how cyborgs in
afrofuturism aren't automatically understood as disabled
subjects]{.mark} the way they might be for crip futurists, crip cyborgs,
or Donna Harroway's cyborg manifesto.]{.underline} Monae doesn't use any
language around disability to describe her conception of androids in
relation to Cindi Mayweather. Instead, Monae understands Cindi as the
mediator between flesh and hand, "the oppressed and the oppressor."¹
Similarly, Kristen Lillvis notes the dual symbolism of Cindi's "Digital
Auction Code" (DAC) featured on the Electric Lady album cover artwork.
The DAC represents the branding of enslaved Africans at the same time it
marks her liberation from bondage---Cindi is not for sale.² [The lack of
language naming Cindi as a disabled cyborg suggests that while it's
possible to interpret her as such, cyborg and disability are not
inherently synonymous in afrofuturism]{.underline}. Similarly, there's
the afrofuturist posthuman with supernatural abilities. [In Parable of
the Sower, Laura Olemina's hyperempathy distinguishes her from other
characters. As Sami Schalk notes, hyperempathy is understood as a
condition as a result of a birth defect.³]{.underline} In an interview
with Juan Williams on NPR's Talk of the Nation, Butler explains that
Laura's mother was addicted to the small pills. As a result, Laura is
born with hyperempathy.4 The question in interpretation becomes whether
hyperempathy is understood as a disability and based off what criteria.
Schaulk uses the example of Williams assertion that Laura isn't
disabled. In response to an ableist remark William's makes, Butler
asserts that she never said Laura wasn't smart, to which Williams
concludes that intelligence cancels out hyperempathy as a form of
disability.5 When considering existing conceptions of afrofuturist
body-minds, I wonder about the seduction of the posthuman. [The trend of
afrofuturist posthumanism points to a particular consciousness around
the possibilities of black bodies in the future. Lillvis understands
afrofuturist posthumanism as a form of consciousness that responds to
the conceptual construction of blackness that occurs because of the
Middle Passage.6 Thus, afrofuturist posthumanism provides a space to
think about black identity independent of white supremacy]{.underline}.7
[Building on this, [I understand the prevalence of the non-disabled
afrofuturist posthuman as a way of envisioning black bodies outside the
spectacle of antiblack violence as opposed to "facilitating its
objectifying qualities]{.mark}."8 Afrofuturist posthumanism is a way
black people have explored the effects of the Middle Passage on flesh,
consciousness, and time.]{.underline}9 It names how the enduring legacy
of antiblack violence is enshrine through the marking of black
body-minds through enslavement. [It names [the process of how violence
marks the black body-mind as non-human]{.mark}, and how non-human status
justifies the continued subjugation]{.underline}. As Zoe Samudzi and
William Anderson note, the marking of the flesh is about personhood as
much as it is about the social status of the enslaved African.10 At the
same time, afrofuturist posthumanism names how the afterlife of slavery
perpetuates black suffering, it also provides a view of black futures
free from white supremacy. As Ytasha Womack notes, afrofuturism flips
conventional thinking about blackness on its head by rejecting
stereotypes, dystopian fatalism, and hopelessness often associated with
black characters. [Instead, [afrofuturism demonstrates that within the
terrain of the speculative, fatalism is not synonymous with
blackness]{.mark}.]{.underline}11 Black suffering is visible, but it is
not an entranchant condition[. If afrofuturism is about envisioning
black futures free from violence and suffering, then to paraphrase
Lillvis, new types of consciousness around the black body-mind must
emerge]{.underline}.12 The black body-mind undergoes a conceptual
shift---from enslaved to liberated subject. It [is no longer a site of
fatalism, but a site of possibility for the future. In this way,
[if]{.mark} [blackness is ascribed the status of non-human under white
supremac]{.mark}y, then [the afrofuturist posthuman is an attempt to
envision the black body-mind as one that is "fully
human]{.mark}."]{.underline} [Afrofuturist posthumans are creative
visions of the body-minds to come, the body-mind that is free from
violence that is no longer the spectacle of suffering on the world's
stage. The body-mind to come is the afrofuturist posthuman that enjoys
the humanity of the black human that doesn't currently exist. But like
any attempt at worldbuilding or futurism, [omitting disability]{.mark}
from schemas of afrofuturist posthumans [has
consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If alternative worldbuilding means
imagining better futures, then [the afrofuturist posthuman as
predominately non-disabled]{.mark} [demonstrates the complexity of
mapping an emerging conception of humanity onto the black
body.]{.mark}]{.underline} [In linking disablement primarily with
enslavement or past history, disability is symbolized as a vestige from
an oppressive past to be done away with.]{.underline} [[Disability gets
understood as part of what makes black people non-human under white
supremacy]{.mark}. In making these links, it fails to interrogate why an
emerging consciousness around afrofuturist posthumanism assumes that
excluding disability inherently facilitates the transition from
non-human to post-human in black futures. It fails to interrogate how a
future without black disabled body-minds is symbolic of black liberation
from white supremacy]{.underline}. [Subsequently, it fails to ask why
the black disabled body-mind isn't already considered
post-human.]{.underline} What are the underlying assumptions about the
relationship between black liberation and posthumanism that would
justify the exclusion of black disabled body-minds? [[What about black
disabled body]{.mark}-minds [provokes anxieties about]{.mark} the
overarching status of "[non-human]{.mark}" assigned to black people
under white supremacy? In many respects, linking disability to past
oppression is ironic given that afrofuturism attempts to move away from
conceiving of black body-minds as sites of fatalism. For all its
liberatory aspirations, [afrofuturist posthumanism has yet to envision
disability as part of an emergent consciousness of black
body-minds]{.mark} conceptualized [independent of white
supremacy]{.mark}]{.underline}. It [has yet to engage a vision of the
future where the presence of black disabled folk signals to a vision of
liberation from violence exists in multiple manifestations]{.underline}.
The presence of black disability in afrofuturist posthumanism doesn't
have to connote to the sort of fatalism afrofuturism seeks to avoid. [It
can represent the liberation of the black body-mind, a radical shift in
existence where one doesn't have to be able-bodied to have a chance at
surviving into the future. The black disabled body-mind can explore the
abundant possibilities for the world to come, in our body-minds to come.
The black cyborg, as an explicitly disabled cyborg, can signal the onset
of a new world where advanced adaptive technology isn't cost prohibitive
and thus financially inaccessible]{.underline}. [The black disabled
cyborg can also signal to a world where adaptive technology is given to
black disabled people as part of reparations for histories of violent,
non-consensual medical experimentation]{.underline}. [The presence of
[the black disabled cyborg can usher in a world where black disabled
folks finally reap what white supremacy]{.mark} in medicine [has
sown]{.mark} at the expense of our ancestors' pain and
exploitation]{.underline}. Similarly, the inclusion of black disabled
body-minds in the future can be represented in the physical
restructuring of society. The predominantly black neighborhood
Wormsley's billboard highlights the disappearance of can be redesigned
to fuse accessibility with the tenants of self-sufficiency,
environmental, and economic sustainability that have become cornerstones
of black liberation movements. [Black neighborhoods can re-emerge,
victorious in the fight against gentrification; replete with accessible
and sustainably designed infrastructures and community resources. In
essence, [the]{.mark} presence of [black disabled body]{.mark}-minds in
afrofuturism [can tell the story of how our people overcame antiblack
violence,]{.mark} [accounting for our multifaceted presence in the
future]{.mark}, our thriving, as opposed to our extinction]{.underline}.
"A Woman Called Moses" and Kindred are examples of this, the power of
the black disabled imagination in carving out pathways to liberation.
[The disablement both Dana and Moses experience plays a role in their
choice to seek freedom from antiblack violence. It not only gave them an
idea of the world they didn't want to live in, but the world they did
want to live in. It plays a role in how they seek to change the present
to affect the future, and how they sought to accomplish liberation. The
existence of their narratives show how black disabled body-minds are
powerful architects of black futures, one that can truly be understood
through an evolving language of afrofuturism that accounts for
disability it all its complexity.]{.underline}

who is capable of producing knowledge through cripistemological methods;
Johnson and McRuer include, importantly, the knowledge gained from being
in relation with another who has been disabled. 

[Decentering the disability expert explodes the conventional disability
studies canon]{.underline}. In a section called "Sensational Crips,"
Johnson and McRuer ground their theory in women of color feminisms and
queer
theory.[12](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-12) [What
distinguishes expertise on disability]{.underline} (conventional
disability studies) [from]{.underline} their conceptualization of
[cripistemology]{.underline} (critical disability studies), [is
[this]{.mark} specific **[genealogy]{.mark}** that insists on **[reading
disability]{.mark}** in and **[through imbrications with gender,
sexuality, class, and race]{.mark}.**]{.underline} For example, Jina B.
Kim imagines [a "crip-of-color critique"]{.underline} [that links
together women of color feminist texts that explore themes of chronic
illness]{.underline} (Audre Lorde, Gloria Anzaldúa), [with recent
disability scholarship that foregrounds race]{.underline} (Jasbir Puar,
Therí Pickens), [through [a coalitional framework of queer of color
critique]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cathy Cohen, Rodrick
Ferguson).[13](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-13) In
the present study, I pick up on the radical political economy thread
within critical disability studies that also marks it as a distinct
formation. Just as feminist of color and queer of color theory is
grounded in Marxist political economy, Johnson and McRuer's
conceptualization indicates that critical disability studies offer a
unique critique of formations of capitalism, and specifically the
disabling conditions of precarity under
neoliberalism.[14](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-14) 

[Crips and mad people offer knowledge that emanates from their position
as a "surplus" class whose presence threatens the political and economic
order.]{.underline}[15](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-15) As
other scholars have elaborated, [**[society has developed]{.mark}** the
ideology]{.underline}, since at least the end of the nineteenth century,
[that bodyminds that carry disease, illness, and impairment are a
"menace]{.underline}."[16](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-16) [This
ideology]{.underline}, that [I]{.underline} would [label as
**[eugenics]{.mark}**]{.underline}, promises a future of human
perfection through scientifically guided interventions that dispose of
diseased, ill, and impaired bodyminds. During the so-called eugenics era
of the 1890s to 1940s, state and federal policies were implemented in
the name of saving the human race and western civilization from rapid
degeneration caused by the reproduction of those from so-called
defective
bloodlines.[17](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-17) [Eugenics
policies]{.underline}, including [**[institutionalization,

articulated]{.mark}** disabled and **[mad bodyminds as crises]{.mark}**
that threatened the imagined future of human
perfection]{.underline}.[18](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-18) However,
these policies fluctuated between contradictory impulses. On the one
side, the crisis of tainted bloodlines called for the state-sanctioned
neglect and premature death of those inside eugenics institutions, those
whose bodyminds could not be made to conform to normative standards of
health. On the other side, paradoxically, the state also promised to
create perfect human health through experimental treatments,
rehabilitation programs, and cures, including reproductive sterilization
on the very same bodies that were neglected and exposed to
death.[19](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-19) 

[The surplus class of disabled and mad bodyminds constructed in the
eugenics era programs was gendered and
racialized.[20](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-20) The
sociotechnical imaginary of eugenics conjured a specifically "female"
threat, relying for justification on fears of unruly people with
uteruses  whose reproductive capacity required containment.]{.underline}
Eugenics programs had specific effects on people with uteruses 
including longer recovery from sterilization surgeries like the
salpingectomy. The [**[threat]{.mark} [of unfit reproduction]{.mark} was
[grounded in]{.mark} white supremacist [fears of race suicide]{.mark},
and eugenics programs [capitalized on long-standing legal
regimes]{.mark}** (including [slavery]{.mark} and [colonialism]{.mark})
**[that deny racialized gendered people bodily
autonomy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.[21](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-21) 

**[[When outright eugenics became outmoded]{.underline}]{.mark}**
following World War II and the stalling of the Great Society in the
United States, new modes of governance were introduced that continued to
draw on the eugenicist imaginary. These [**[new]{.mark} modes of
[governance]{.mark}**, including]{.underline} policies [of
[**privatization**, **deregulation**]{.underline}]{.mark}[, and
[**market liberalization**, exploded into]{.mark}]{.underline} what Mia
Mingus, Eli Clare, and others call "[[the]{.mark} **[m]{.mark}edical
[i]{.mark}ndustrial
[c]{.mark}omplex**]{.underline}."[22](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-22) In
the medical industrial complex, billions of dollars are funneled into
[the discovery of new diseases and impairments, while pharmaceutical and
technological innovations are promised that can rid society of disease
and impairment "once and for all."]{.underline} [As an outcome of
neoliberalism, the medical industrial complex continued the eugenicist
project of locating crisis within disabled and mad
bodyminds,]{.underline} [and]{.underline} again [promised social health
could be achieved by curing disease and disability. [This]{.mark}
theorization]{.underline} of the medical industrial complex [[**maps**
**onto**]{.underline}]{.mark} what political theorist Giorgio Agamben
names [**[the "state of exception]{.mark}"** as a mode of liberal
governance]{.underline}.[23](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-23) According
to Agamben, [[the]{.mark} temporality]{.underline} of neoliberalism
[justifies the [permanent]{.mark}ly [temporary suspension of civil
liberties]{.mark}.]{.underline} Similarly, the medical industrial
complex's rhetoric of crisis and recovery justifies the curtailment of
bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom for populations including mad
and disabled people, poor and racialized women, and bodyminds with
diverse genders. 

However, [[**despite** the **rehabilitative promise**]{.mark},
neoliberal policies of [**deregulation**, **privatization**, and]{.mark}
market [**liberalization** **are implicated in** **creating
the**]{.mark} very **[conditions of precarity]{.mark}** that exacerbate
illness, impairment, and mental insecurity]{.underline}. Over the last
three decades of the twentieth century, organized government divestment
from urban and rural communities that were segregated by race and class
from white suburbs left communities of color and poor communities to
rely on themselves for access to education, food, and security. [The
already flimsy social safety net was systematically dismantled through
the end of the twentieth century through privatization and
disinvestment.]{.underline} At the same time, growing wealth inequality
ground down the middle class by pushing all but the super-rich into
competition for scarce resources. It was in this context that Butler
wrote Parable of the Sower, fictionalizing her portrayal of a
multiracial neighborhood forced into extreme self-reliance. The
situation has only worsened in the twenty-first century, as the economy
rapidly concentrates jobs in low-paying service and gig industries.

These neoliberal governance policies have a particular impact on
disabled and mad people, particularly those who are also racialized and
gendered. The process of closing or reducing the size of state
psychiatric hospitals and institutions for people classified as
intellectually/developmentally disabled beginning the 1960s---known as
deinstitutionalization---was one of the first acts of privatization in
the neoliberal model in the US. Subsequently, the US has created a
bifurcated neoliberal system where the minority, typically white and
wealthy, disabled people receive care only through private medical
insurance or family members, while many more disabled and mad people of
color have been criminalized and warehoused in jails and prisons. Even
when public funds are invested in care, the neoliberal state has
repeatedly refused to invest in treatments and services that would keep
people alive, well, and out of institutions, funneling public money into
private industries like nursing homes and to the carceral system rather
than directly to sick, disabled, and mad people, or to the programs we
want, such as in home
support.[24](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-24) Preventable
deaths of high-profile disability activists, such as Carrie Ann Lucas,
attest to the tragic consequences of neoliberal governance, which is
focused more on cutting costs than supporting
life.[25](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-25) How
many other lives have been cut short due to the combination of conjured
crisis, emphasis on cure, organized neglect, and the displacement of
blame onto disabled and mad bodyminds? 

In addition to what has now become almost routine, systematic, premature
death, neoliberalism has increased vulnerability to disaster, especially
in the face of capitalism-induced rapid climate change. [From
supercharged hurricanes to wildfires entering urban spaces, mass death
and injury are the consequence, and disabled and mad bodyminds are at
increased
risk]{.underline}.[26](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-26) As
these disasters show, [government aid for communities made vulnerable to
disasters through neoliberal economic policy is not a realistic
expectation.]{.underline} The rolling power shut-offs orchestrated by
Pacific Gas & Electric company in northern California in the name of
preventing wildfires illustrate that neither local or state governments,
nor the private companies granted authority over critical
infrastructure, take any responsibility for ensuring the safety of
disabled and chronically ill
people.[27](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-27) Further,
[neoliberal governance absolves the state from blame, pointing the
finger on disabled bodyminds ourselves for any suffering and premature
death that results from conditions of precarity.]{.underline} 

[As "situated knowledge" growing out of the experience of precarity,
**[cripistemologies expose how neoliberal governance]{.mark}
simultaneously [creates and deflects responsibility for disabling
conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.[28](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-28) The

Octavia Butler's novel [Parable of the Sower exemplifies [a
**cripistemological critique of neoliberal
governance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Butler has a created [a Black femme
protagonist]{.underline} with a disabling impairment. [Devalued
under]{.underline} the terms of [neoliberalism due to her impairment,
racial status, and gender assignment]{.underline}, this protagonist
gains specific knowledge about how to survive disabling precarity.
Further, the character critiques the solutions for crisis proffered by
neoliberal governance---namely, privatization and deregulation that
facilitates medical industrial cure. [In Parable, the Black feminist
cripistemologist protagonist [orchestrates the emergence of a
collective]{.mark} that offers a powerful alternative to reliance on the
eugenicist solutions of the neoliberal state. ]{.underline}

Parable follows Lauren Oya Olamina, a teenager living with her family in
a walled-off community near Los Angeles in the year 2024. Outside of the
neighborhood walls awaits starvation, rape, sexual exploitation,
addiction, and murder. Olamina (as she was called by Butler) lives in a
neighborhood that has banded together to survive by rigging up security
systems, growing food, collecting water, schooling children, and
worshipping together at a makeshift church. When Olamina's family is
murdered and the neighborhood burned down, she forges a new destiny. She
creates a multiracial chosen family that she encourages to walk from Los
Angeles to the far northern part of California, with the promise of
building a more intentional community on more secluded land. 

[[Olamina has]{.underline}]{.mark} a fictional impairment known as
**[[hyperempathy]{.underline}]{.mark}** syndrome, which causes her to
physically feel the pain or pleasure of any person she can see.
[Throughout the novel, [she]{.mark} **[experiences]{.mark} the [gunshot
wounds, sexual violence, and starvation]{.mark}**]{.underline} of others
she encounters. Layered on top of Olamina's [hyperempathy syndrome are
symptoms of what might be diagnosed as]{.underline} post-traumatic
stress syndrome ([PTSD]{.underline}), including symptoms of
hypervigilance and insomnia. However, in her context, some of these PTSD
symptoms are practical assets. Entering debates about whether Olamina's
hyperempathy is a gift or an impairment, Sami Schalk reframes [the
syndrome as a disability given the specific social, political, and
economic context of Olamina's
life.]{.underline}[30](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-30) As
Schalk points out, [even the ability to share pleasure becomes twisted
in the dystopic future that Butler created for Olamina. **[Olamina
suffers from---and]{.mark}**, in several terrifying instances,
**[is]{.mark} completely [debilitated by---her nervous system's response
to witnessing both pain and pleasure.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[One reading of the novel might argue that it is a story about
**[crisis]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and consequently, that it [**[inhabits
the same temporality as neoliberal governance]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Indeed, Butler intended for the novel to depict the interlocking crises
of the neoliberal present. Butler sought to imagine where ["our current
behaviors and unintended problems might take us," honing in on patterns
in the United States of extreme wealth inequality, the abjection of
low-wage and surplus workers, carceral expansion, disinvestment in
social resources, and the effects of human-caused climate
change.]{.underline}[31](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-31) Of
interest to the present essay are Butler's additional concerns about
pharmaceutical drug abuse and declining access to life-saving medical
treatments. [Both trends are effects of the neoliberal medical
industrial complex that prioritizes profit over life and health---and
the latter trend is a specific crisis for Black women]{.underline}. 

Olamina's impairment, for example, is caused by her mother's abuse
during pregnancy of a fictional drug called Paracetco, so-called
"Einstein
powder."[32](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-32) [**[Mirroring
current real-life conditions]{.mark}** facing pregnant Black people, in
the novel such pharmaceuticals are apparently the only form of
**[medical care readily accessible, while other needs suffer, including
maternal health]{.mark}**. This racialized and gendered neoliberal
contradiction plays out in the text when]{.underline},
[after]{.underline} apparently [causing]{.underline}
[hyperempathy]{.underline} syndrome in her child due to drug use,
**[Olamina's mother dies]{.underline}** during childbirth. In 1993,
when Parable was published, the number of pregnancy-related deaths had
already jumped to 11.1 per 100,000 live births from a low of 7.2 in
1987; the number steadily climbed to 17.3 in
2017.[33](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-33) Olamina's
mother's death represents the specifically racialized dimension of this
problem, as non-Hispanic Black women experienced a pregnancy-related
mortality rate that was almost three times that of non-Hispanic white
women between the years of 2014 and 2017. A participatory research
justice study of Black women's maternal health concluded that numerous
barriers have been erected that prevent Black women from accessing
prenatal care, including "inadequate health insurance coverage,"
"distrust of and poor treatment by prenatal care providers," "structural
inequities" that produce stress that contribute to poor health outcomes,
and "institutional budget constraints" that prevent providers from
offering adequate
care.[34](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-34) Each
of these trends, I argue, can be directly attributed to the ramped up
neoliberalization of medical care in the United States over the past
thirty years. 

Common responses to these disabling conditions are either to cling to
the neoliberal promise of recovery through more privatization and
deregulation leading to market solutions, or to demand a return of
government investment in the social safety
net. [**[Parable rejects]{.mark}** both the **[neoliberal and liberal
impulses, enacting a cripistemologically grounded critique]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} emphatically [resists]{.mark}** the assumption **[that
recovery will come through either more advanced capitalism or state
interventions]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In the case of market solutions,
Butler imagines the return of an indentured servitude in a kind of
company town, where able-bodied individuals forfeit their freedom to the
corporation in exchange for shelter, food, and protection from outside
violence. In this extreme version of privatization, it is as if the
state does not exist. Consequently, all human value is reduced to the
ability to work, a status that Olamina recognizes as excluding disabled
bodyminds like hers. 

Butler also reminds us that [under neoliberalism, **[the state is
incentivized]{.mark} and disciplined [into accelerating its collusion
with capital, producing]{.mark} [racialized, gendered, and disabled life
as "surplus" through routine forms of
governance]{.mark}.**]{.underline}[35](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-35) Early
in the novel, Butler depicts the election of Charles Morpeth Donner as
President of the United States. [Exemplifying neoliberal logic by
insisting on operating the government like a business, Donner's proposal
for restoring the economy and "putting people back to work" is to
dismantle labor protections and environmental
regulations.]{.underline}[36](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-36) Olamina
wonders, "And what about those suspended laws? **[[Will it be legal to
poison, mutilate, or infect people---as long as you provide them with
food, water, and space to
die?"]{.underline}]{.mark}**[37](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-37) Identifying
how the disablement of citizens occurs in the name of economic profit,
Olamina exposes the fantasy of recovery to something called normal,
organized through the mode of neoliberal governance, as a farce and a
form of what Lauren Berlant calls "cruel
optimism."[38](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-38) 

Yet, exceeding mere critique of the interlocking crises of the
neoliberal present, the novel also presents alternative possible futures
for those who manage to survive neoliberal catastrophe. One other
possible future emerges through collective, community-based emergency
planning spearheaded by the visionary foresight of Olamina. Butler's
protagonist anticipates the need to prepare materially, psychically, and
spiritually for the coming disaster, challenging her parents and other
adults who cling to a restoration of normality. Olamina's differences
from her family and community, differences which include but are not
limited to her impairment and her unorthodox spiritual vision, force her
to grapple with the inadequacy of the status quo for her survival.

[Olamina's impairment has lent her a pessimistic pragmatism forged
through the need to make difficult decisions in order to survive through
the bouts of sudden and debilitating pain that her impairment
brings]{.underline}. Perhaps it is due to these attributes, gained
through impairment, that young Olamina has the ability to push past the
fantasy of normalcy in order to forge an alternative plan for survival.
While her father and other adults in the community worked to shore up
the fences that surround the neighborhood in a desperate bid to maintain
the status quo, Olamina secretly assembled an emergency kit, saved cash,
and studied edible wild foods. Olamina's preparations ultimately save
her life after the neighborhood is attacked, and she is forced to flee
alone on foot. [Olamina's **[anticipation of]{.mark} the
[failure]{.mark} of the status quo [is cripistemological and serves as a
vital model of emergency preparedness for crip collectivities]{.mark}
[facing neoliberal disasters]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This is a form of
**[planning based on]{.mark} the crip of color [knowledge
that]{.mark}**, especially in times of crisis, **[there may not
be]{.mark}** any **[government aid]{.mark}** to call upon]{.underline}.
Olamina's example is an invitation to pack emergency kits and make
collective disaster evacuation plans; to vision with our communities
about mutual aid and self-sufficiency; to learn to grow food, harvest
wild food, and make medicine; and to craft ethics and principles that
can guide our collective decision-making outside and beyond the state.
[Although categorized under the genre of speculative fiction or science
fiction, **the text provides an urgent example for [developing practical
plans]{.mark}** to survive the precarious conditions of the neoliberal
present.]{.underline} 

Powerfully, the novel moves beyond strategizing for crip survival to
imagining what Alison Kafer calls "feminist, queer, crip" futures;
futures that have until now largely been absent from eugenicist and
neoliberal sociotechnical
imaginaries.[39](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-39) Similarly,
the Sins Invalid performing arts collective of queer and trans disabled
people of color articulates "disability justice" as a demand for more
than the mere survival of disabled and mad
people.[40](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-40) While
critique offers the barest minimum necessary for the survival of those
devalued under neoliberalism, disability justice also demands a practice
of imagining possible futures where queer and trans disabled and mad
people of color can "flourish," in Sins Invalid collective member's
Patty Berne's
terms.[41](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-41) 

[**[Parable imagines possible futures for those]{.mark}** who have
**been [disabled and made mad]{.mark}** by the precarious conditions of
neoliberalism. The novel depicts more than mere crip survival, **[the
story imagines crip flourishing through the emergence of the
collective]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Once Olamina is forced from her
domestic space and left with virtually nothing, she cultivates
alternative public arrangements of care and intimacy, building a chosen
family and community. Butler provides the following description of this
collective emergence: 

When Olamina's birth community is destroyed, she begins to build
another. She doesn't know at first that that's what she's doing, and
she's afraid---terrified---of potentially dangerous strangers. But she
learns to reach out in spite of her fear, to choose the best people she
can find and bring them together. With her acceptance of Earthseed, she
relinquishes hope for supernatural help . . . She believes that our only
dependable help must come from ourselves and from one
another.[42](https://csalateral.org/section/cripistemologies-of-crisis/crip-collectivity-beyond-neoliberalism-octavia-butler-parable-of-the-sower-whatcott/#fn-9253-42)

Family and community are brought together through Olamina's visionary
creation of an unorthodox spiritual tradition that she calls Earthseed.
Earthseed grows into a multiracial and multigenerational community of
people who have been impaired, traumatized, and dispossessed by the
catastrophe of neoliberal capitalism and abandoned by the neoliberal
state. Together Earthseed as an intentional community defies relegation
to tragedy, creating possible futures for themselves through
interdependence and mutual aid. 

The Earthseed imaginary and the possible futures they create challenge
eugenicist strands within neoliberal narratives. As I have discussed,
neoliberalism structurally creates disabling conditions through
privatization and deregulation, and then continues the eugenicist
tradition of displacing responsibility for structural precarity onto
surplus disabled and mad bodyminds. The Earthseed community resists this
process of disablement, by collectively preparing for changing
conditions, building capacity to adapt to changing conditions, and
indeed, learning how to "shape" inevitable change. Through her depiction
of Earthseed, Butler depicts how **[[building collective]{.mark} crip
[resilience]{.mark} offers a path [for surviving within neoliberalist
precarity and creating flourishing futures for those]{.mark} that would
[otherwise be devalued under the neoliberal status
quo.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

multiability encounter]{.mark}]{.underline}. In my article on
television's Monk, [I proposed that Blackness and madness cannot take up
the same space within one interaction.]{.underline} I read the
protagonist's unnamed obsessive-compulsive disorder as a disability that
"misfits" with other (usually minor) characters' Blacknesses.30 At
times, one is used for comedic fodder or erased in favor of representing
the other or eclipsed as a way to demonstrate white liberalism. [My
article describes the relationship between these two identities as
mutually constituted, but it evinces some slippage when attempting to
discern why the protagonist's disability erases the other characters'
Blackness]{.underline}. **[Since [Blackness and madness do not reside in
the same body]{.mark}, the various [drama-comedy scripts]{.mark}
[tergiversate about what difference among difference can mean]{.mark},
[often mobilizing white liberalism to police disability and
Blackness]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Rereading my own work with an eye
toward the breaks, I find that we not only lack a critical vocabulary
for describing Blackness and madness simultaneously, but it is also
assumed that one must take priority over the other[. The end result is
that in this interracial encounter---whether fictionalized, theorized,
or criticized---either Blackness or madness must be erased.]{.underline}
Important for this conversation is that the multiracial, multiability
encounter shifts depending on the social position of the characters.
Blackness cannot and should not be marshaled as the radical space for
white liberalism to mount its critique of ableism or racism. [[When
Blackness and madness exist in the same space, multiple ways of
reading]{.mark} should [become possible]{.mark}, some of which eschew
the possibility of radicality and others that might usher it in. The
multiability interracial encounter also allows for Blackness and madness
to be erased when improperly thought of as agentive]{.underline}.
Because both discourses are often conceptualized as unspeakable or
illegible, their presence can facilitate and consolidate the power that
creates abject material conditions. Nirmala Erevelles makes this point
most forcefully: "The analytic category of disability is useful in
destabilizing static notions of identity, exploring intersectionality,
and investigating embodiment, \[yet\] I argue that the effectiveness of
much of feminist disability studies remains limited because of its
overreliance on metaphor at the expense of materiality."31 In other
words[, [Blackness and disability have the potential to destabilize the
rhetoric of normalcy]{.mark} that holds them as abject, but they are
curtailed in doing so when mislabeled as agentive.]{.underline} In
Erevelles's exploration of the lived conditions of war, [she argues that
[when disability]{.mark} (both physical and mental) [intersects with
Black and brown bodies]{.mark} in the developing world or in
disenfranchised communities within the developed world, [their
confluence indicts unchecked multinational corporate greed]{.mark}
because it reveals the politicized nature of impairment.]{.underline}
With this in mind, there can be no ableist or racist narrative available
that prioritizes individualized achievement (read: overcoming) or
bemoans bad luck (read: pity) because the root cause implicates specific
governments, companies, the people who run them, and those who are
complicit in them. In addition, Erevelles resists ascribing agency to
the disabled people of color she discusses, perhaps because, in this
version of David and Goliath, Goliath is winning. [More to the point,
the [material conditions for celebration and agency require material
resources not available to everyone, and mere knowledge of one's
situation cannot be proxy for freedom from it, nor does awareness equal
agency]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2AC \-\-- Materiality 

#### Not all revolutions bring freedom -- only the 1AC's weaponization of violence against violence turns the colonized world [disorderly]{.underline}, rendering one divinebiomechanical, thus, a cyborg

Joy **James 13** \["Concerning Violence": Frantz Fanon's Rebel
Intellectual in Search of a Black Cyborg, Winter 2013, The South
Atlantic Quarterly, doi 10.1215/00382876-1891233, accessed 7/13/22,
-ekh-\]

In "Concerning Violence," Fanon offers a definition of revolutionaries
in search of freedom predicated on truth not deception: "the fellah, the
unemployed man, the starving native do not lay a claim to the truth;
they do not say that they represent the truth for they are the truth"
(1963: 49).4

[For Fanon, "Truth is the property of the national cause. . . . **[Truth
is that which hurries on the break-up of the colonialist
regime]{.mark}**; it is that which promotes the emergence of the nation;
it is [all that protects the natives, and ruins the
foreigners]{.mark}"]{.underline} (1963: 50). He [sounds apocalyptic, but
**[his commitment here is for the nation-state, not for "humanity" in
general.]{.mark}** Fanon preserves the native in human form and
recognizes that truth is about change. [Change is inevitable. Progress
is not. **Revolutions bring about change, true, but not all revolutions
bring freedom**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For Fanon, [the native can
challenge imposed immobility if and when he or she "decides to put an
end to the history of colonization---the history of pillage---and to
bring into existence the history of the nation---the history of
decolonization"]{.underline} (51).

What we recognize now, from the vantage point of the early twentyfirst
century, half a century after Fanon's Les damnés de la terre was
published in English, is that [transforming the colony into the
independent nation was not the endpoint of revolutionary struggle or
even its midmark]{.underline}. The nation is as passé or anachronistic
today as the colony was in the mid-twentieth century. The entity to be
transformed and liberated today is both individual and collective.
[**[The revolutionary objective is to be freed from a humanity]{.mark}**
which [under]{.mark} centuries of [capitalism and imperialism has become
another commodity in the marketplace.]{.mark} One **[sold with the
accessories of Western democracy, consumer culture, mass advertising,
and excess juxtaposed with]{.mark}** increasing
**[deforestation]{.mark}** of lands and **[devastation]{.mark}** of
seas, [and]{.mark} the **[extinction of species or their patenting by
biotechnology firms]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Fanon as the observer and chronicler is not the fellah. So he is not the
"truth"; he relays it through analyses and words, always one step or
level removed from total intimacy with and surrender to it. [The truth
may be that not only what hurries on the demise of the settler but the
demise of the fellah as well is truth. And what better, quicker break
from the fellah, former captive, wannabe administrator, than to allow
him or her to be reborn as cyborg?]{.underline}

**[[Decolonization "sets out to change the order of the world," making
it]{.underline}]{.mark}** for Fanon [**a "program of complete
[disorder]{.mark}"**]{.underline} (36). (One hears this echoed in prison
theorist, Black Panther Party field marshal George L. Jackson's call for
"perfect disorder" in Blood in My Eye \[1996\].) [Faced with two
"species"--- the colonized native and the colonizing
settler]{.underline}---Fanon envisions [violence as the historical and
futuristic trajectory resulting from first contact. And it is this
violence that must be resolved in revolutionary struggle.]{.underline}
If the New Testament philosophical/metaphysical injunction is read by
Fanon as a Manichaean material struggle that realizes that "the last
shall be first and the first last" (37), then [**[there is nothing but
the physicality of violence to resolve the contest and to realize the
divine law.]{.mark}**5 **Divine law seems to be [attended]{.mark} often
[by sacrifice and suffering and by violence]{.mark}**. Evil seems never
easily to succumb to good, nor does good succumb to evil, even when
racialization is not part of the pattern]{.underline}. Yet, when is it
not? Fanon describes how [**[the Manichaean logic of racism represents
the native in zoological terms.]{.mark}** The colonizer "speaks of the
yellow man's reptilian motions, of the stink of the native quarter, of
breeding swarms, of foulness, of spawn, of gesticulations. When the
settler seeks to describe the native fully in exact terms he constantly
refers to the bestiary"]{.underline} (1963: 42).6

White supremacy is part of the religion of finance and acquisition; thus
Fanon describes how colonizers constructed Manichaeanism, the struggle
of good versus evil, as a racial and political mandate:

[The colonial world is a Manichean world. It is not enough for the
settler to delimit physically, that is to say with the help of the army
and the police force, the place of the native.]{.underline} As if to
show the totalitarian character of colonial exploitation the settler
paints the native as a sort of quintessence of evil. . . . [**[The
native is declared insensible to ethics; he represents]{.mark} not only
[the absence of values,]{.mark} but also the [negation of values. He
is]{.mark}**, let us dare to admit, **[the enemy of values]{.mark}**,
and in this sense he is [the absolute evil]{.mark}.]{.underline} (1963:
41)

With such proclamations, both explicit and subtle, [the settler state or
colonizing culture is able to declare total war against the native as
not only the enemy of the state but also the enemy of the present and
future civilization]{.underline}. Thus for Fanon, "The native who
decides to put the program into practice, and to become its moving force
is ready for violence at all times. From birth it is clear to him that
this narrow world, strewn with prohibitions, can only be called in
question by absolute violence" (37).

[The violence introduced not by the native but by the settler is the
necessary requirement to enslave, control, exploit, and manipulate.
[If]{.mark} the [natives have been transformed into]{.mark} the [perfect
or complete victims]{.mark}---acquiescent, passive, obedient,
conformist, and mimetic---[then to undo their slavery requires a violent
transformation they must undergo by their own hands. **This**]{.mark}
**self-making [requires]{.mark} that [the slave become rebel or
revolutionary]{.mark}**. The **[willingness to meet violence with
violence at all levels is what renders her or him mechanical,]{.mark}
and thus [divine, above moral law or the laws of
man]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

That is to say, [**[the process]{.underline}**]{.mark} and apparatus
**[[of making abled and disabled emerges not simply out of capitalism,
but out of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [**[racial
subsidies]{.underline}**]{.mark} upon **[[which it is based, producing
the twin needs to humanize those who control the means of production and
dehumanize those who do not and do so at varying levels of
stratification depending upon context, locale, political exigency,
extant social mores, etc.]{.underline}]{.mark}** As Ryan Fics puts this
matter, **[["disability and ability aren't]{.underline}]{.mark}**
necessarily the **[[product of capital, but,
rather]{.underline}]{.mark}**, they **[[are co-originary with that which
informs and arranges capital]{.mark}, [especially the white supremacy
that undergirds" its historical formation and
emergence.]{.mark}]{.underline}**25 Yet **[[another component of this
co-originary logic is that of extermination.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The
extreme and systematic acts of violence and murder by white Americans
against Black Americans has been a historical mainstay.26 **[[Making
Black bodies disabled]{.mark}]{.underline}** and making Black bodies
dead **[[is at the center of the structural intertwining of ableism and
anti-Black racism upon which this country is
founded.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Along with the racial subsidies upon
which the power of capture, influence, and polarization is afforded to
those who are racialized as white comes also the production of social
identity. When James Baldwin claims that whiteness must be seen in terms
of the "protection of . . . identity," I take him to be pointing to the
way that whiteness becomes constitutive of the very sense of self of
white Americans, of those who live in its possibilities of violence and
capital gains without limits---as well as living with limits to their
own exposure to certain types of living and labor conditions.27 But a
central feature of capitalism, like any economic system, turns on the
distribution, accumulation, and transferal of abilities. The ability to
build, to buy, to negotiate, to insure, to sell, and to move capital
(both social and financial) just is, among other things, a particular
economy of this way of distributing ability. And insofar as **[[the
birth of the]{.underline}]{.mark}** (modern) **[[racial subject is
linked to the history of capitalism, then this is at the same time to
claim that the birth of the]{.underline}]{.mark}** (modern) **[[disabled
subject is linked to the history of capitalism.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
One of the intellectual tasks at hand, I think, is to better see how
**[[the social value of]{.mark} [any]{.mark}]{.underline}** given
**[["human" ability has become refracted through
whiteness]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which is to say, how
**[[whiteness]{.underline}]{.mark}** inflects (and, certainly,
**[[infects]{.mark}) [what]{.mark} [any]{.mark}
[individual]{.mark}]{.underline}** or **[[group]{.mark} [is taken to be
able to do]{.mark}]{.underline}** and **[[whether that ability is held
to carry any value]{.underline}]{.mark}**, any capital. Sylvia Wynter
explicitly links disability (both physical and cognitive) with the
meaning of Blackness and the legacy of anti-black racism and settler
colonialism in the United States more generally. "The bottommost role of
Black Americans in the United States is systemically produced . . . a
parallel and interlinked role is also played by the category of the
Poor, the jobless, the homeless, the 'underdeveloped,' all of whom,
interned in their systemically produced poverty and expendability, are
now made to function in the reoccupied place of the Leper of the
medieval order and of the Mad of the monarchical, so as to actualize at
the economic level the same dysgenic or dysselected-by-Evolution
conception."28 On my reading, Wynter is here claiming that white
supremacy in the United States has relegated Black Americans to disabled
outcasts. This means, among other things, that being disabled cannot
somehow offer protection for those who are black, as Curry's analysis
assumes in principle, whether through increased pity, consideration,
social supports, or what have you.

## Afropess 

### 2AC \-\-- Ruse of Analogy 

#### Ruse of analogy leads to the erasure of the black disabled body- not only are coalitions possible, but blackness and madness have collective histories that are intrinsically tied to one another. 

**Pickens 19** \[Therí Alyce Pickens, Professor of English, specializing

theories at Bates University, June 7, 2019 "Black Madness :: Mad
Blackness", Duke University Press, Durham and London, pgs. 2-4, JMH\]

Quite frankly, Kriegel's essay is painful to read. The outdated
language, the faulty analogy, the internalized ableism, the profound
lack of community--- all of these depict experiences of disability and
Blackness detached from social and/or political context. In Kriegel's
essay, [[Blackness and Black social movements]{.mark} provide a loose
social mooring. To write at the tail end of the 1960s in New York
requires an engagement with Blackness as a matter of accuracy and
rigor.]{.underline} So, Kriegel's essay considers---as it should---the
import of social positioning vis-à-vis Blackness. [Thinking of the essay
as an artifact, it [clarifies how the Black power movements and civil
rights gains of the 1950s and 1960s paved the way for disability
activism]{.mark} around the Rehabilitation Act (1973), and, by
extension, the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990), among
others.]{.underline} Frantz Fanon provides the essay's central
theoretical interlocutor, which could potentially position the "like
race" idea less as analogy, shifting the discursive terrain such that
the essay centralizes the projected experiences of Blackness. It
doesn't. [[Fanon]{.mark}'s theories do [prove useful,]{.mark} however[,
in thinking about the social situations that difference creates and
abets]{.mark}. Even though the essay references the world, it is not
grounded in it.]{.underline} As a result, the analysis fails on a few
registers. [[The "like race" analogies for disability function as missed
opportunities for nuance]{.mark}. There are only certain well-worn paths
that logic can follow. First, [the comparative element]{.mark} leaves
Kriegel little choice but to think through the relationship in
hierarchical terms where one identity is more or less disenfranchised
than the other.]{.underline} Indeed, this vacillates for Kriegel
depending on the situation (i.e., the disabled have less social options,
but Blacks have been victimized more[), which demonstrates a kind of
sophistication in understanding that each identity category operates
differently depending on social context. Yet, the analogy still
facilitates racist erasure: despite the fact that Kriegel's
rehabilitation facility is in Harlem, he [does not think through the
life of the Black disabled person]{.mark}, nor does he speculate about
the interiority of those around him.]{.underline} They are merely
sullen. **[[The "as" of the simile]{.mark} and, by extension, [the
"like" of the]{.mark} larger [analogy]{.mark} elide the differences
between these identities because [rhetorically one replaces the
other]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Erasure then allows for a collapse of
important distinctions in experience]{.underline}** (i.e., difference
between Kriegel's European immigrant mother and the Blacks in Harlem),
**[and the depiction of Blackness as an abject monolith incapable of
providing its own analogy and method.]{.underline}** Placing Fanon in
this context only allows him to expose and explain Blackness as a
pathology of the West, rather than allow Fanon to function as a
theoretician that dialogues with and about Blackness and disability
(albeit one who makes certain problematic "like race" analogies
himself). [In its failure, Kriegel's essay foregrounds why the "like
race" analogies are missed opportunities: They potentially promise a
useful engagement with Blackness and disability because they grant that
the two share social similarities. However, **[without addressing
collective histories, theoretical impulses, and subjectivities with
nuance, the analogy reinscribes the erasure it originally promises to
rectify.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Although Kriegel's essay was published
in 1969, the theoretical and methodological residues of his project
remain. [To think through the relationship between race and disability
requires answering several questions:]{.underline} How might we read
race and disability outside the confines of the scripts heretofore
provided? In what ways do we need to shift or challenge existing
analytical paradigms? [To what aesthetic practices and thinkers do we
need to turn to expand our imaginations vis-à-vis these two discourses
and material realities?]{.underline} What sacred cows or shibboleths do
we need to leave behind methodologically, theoretically, aesthetically?
This project, **[[Black Madness :: Mad Blackness, turns to madness and
Blackness to answer]{.mark} these [questions about race and
disability]{.mark} more broadly. Critical discourses about madness and
Blackness tend to implicate but not include each other.4]{.underline}**
As a consequence, [the criticism recapitulates several pervasive but
incomplete ideas. One of those is the loose rendering of Blackness and
madness as analogous to each other.]{.underline} More often, the two
discourses are examined as extensions of one another, too slippery to
parse, yet so inseparable that one can elide or replace the other. In
contrast, [I theorize that madness (broadly defined) and Blackness have
a complex constellation of relationships]{.underline}. **[[These
relationships between Blackness and madness]{.mark} (and race and
disability more generally) [are constituted within the fissures, breaks,
and gaps in critical and literary texts]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Black
madness and mad Blackness then are not interchangeable or reciprocal.
Rather, they foreground the multiple and, at times, conflicting
epistemological and ontological positions at stake when reading the two
alongside each other]{.underline}. In exploring these critical
possibilities, [I explicate how this set of relationships has, makes,
and acquires meaning in the various spaces they occupy without
necessarily guaranteeing emancipation or radicality.]{.underline} **[I
turn to what may be an unlikely site to explore: Black speculative
fiction.]{.underline}** These artists-theorists disrupt Western
epistemology such that their work becomes a locus for thinking through
putatively strange Black minds.5 Allow me to explain the title as an
inroad to describing our current critical moment.6 [Black Madness :: Mad
Blackness rests on the idea that ability and race are
intertwined,]{.underline} as Michelle Jarman notes, "two dynamic
discursive processes that inform one another."7 [Suturing madness and
Blackness together, I debunk the perception that the title is redundant,
oxymoronic, or excessive.]{.underline} **[[In]{.mark} an ideological
construct of [white supremacy, Blackness is considered synonymous with
madness or the prerequisite for creating madness]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
To push them together syntactically runs the risk of appearing
repetitive, but it also prompts the possibility that the two must be
parsed.

[Fanon's "Concerning Violence" rebellion against colonization and
slavery offers dreams of freedom]{.underline} but little vision of a
posthuman or posthumanist world. His redemption appears in the same
world, one now with black "sinners" leading the white "saints."
Essentially, this is the same driven world but with different persona at
the helm. [**[Power relations are inverted]{.mark}**, not transcended,
for the world remains a domain for humans trying to prove or disprove
humanity and thus their right to rule. One is left to wonder about a
world in which the native, fellah, and sistah **[relinquish the fight to
be considered "human,"]{.mark}** and subsequently folded into the
national or international communities, and seek instead [to **become
black cyborg rebels**]{.mark}---**[biologicalmechanical-divine entities
in service to freedom]{.mark}**.]{.underline} (Some might argue that the
"true" cyborg rebel comes from slavery, not from colonization; only
slavery destroyed the full humanity of both the master and the enslaved
as well as the terrain that gives meaning to one's past.)

[The ability [to **refuse blackness-as-victimization** and reconstitute
**blackness-as-resistance may be the black cyborg rebel's only real
possession**]{.mark}. Blackness [no longer as the negation or target of
white supremacy maneuvers]{.mark} as [something no longer human]{.mark},
or [subhuman]{.mark} [or]{.mark} [deficient]{.mark} in humanity. Human
and black have been constructed as oxymoronic for at least half a
millennium in the West]{.underline} (and longer elsewhere). [The
Underground Railroad, as an escape path away from the gravitational pull
of whiteness-as-mastery, would entail a flight from the "human" as
well.]{.underline}

**[[The cyborg rebel's three-in-one trinity---divine, biological,
mechanical--- offers an unlikely road toward
freedom]{.underline}]{.mark}** for Fanon[. **The scientist** who
**reduces the divine to superstition or colonialist
propaganda**]{.underline}, the **[biological to the colonizer's war
against nature embodied in the native]{.underline}**, and the
[**mechanical to technologies of warfare and finance that enabled the
colonialist to triumph, would not pursue this** line of
inquiry.]{.underline} Yet, Fanon writes that [[if the morality of the
colonizer is to break the native's spirit]{.mark}, then [the morality of
the native is to rekindle that spirit by breaking the settler's
"flaunting violence"]{.mark} and by [putting him "out of the
picture"]{.mark} (]{.underline}1963: 44).

[It is only one step more in imagination to **[put the human out of the
picture]{.mark}**, to **[banish the unending genocidal squabbles over
who is "human]{.mark}**." Costly struggles to possess or refashion the
prize, [the social construct "human," may not in fact be
revolutionary]{.mark} battles but skirmishes.]{.underline} [Given that
the gravity of and triumph in warfare are not determined by body counts,
perhaps **[rethinking the "thinking body" as]{.mark}** something
**[different but not]{.mark}** necessarily **[superior]{.mark}** to
human might be one of the few rewards for centuries of rebellions
against violence.]{.underline} [**[The cyborg embrace might be one
strategy toward freedom that distinguishes the dreamers from the
visionaries]{.mark}**, the henceforward moment that puts another game
into play.]{.underline}

### 2AC \-\-- Social Death

#### Disabled, racial bodies have been [derealized]{.underline}, an [ontological limbo]{.underline} manifested in an [infinite paranoia]{.underline} unexplainable with their broader ontological claims

Judith Butler's notion of **[[derealization]{.underline}]{.mark}** may
very well [[have become]{.mark} one of the premier analytics for
considering [the **epistemological ravages performed by the**]{.mark}
so-called "**[War on 'Terror'" upon]{.mark}** countless **[racialized
bodies and collectives]{.mark}**]{.underline} (this is, of course,
[contemporaneous to the physical ravages of bombs, bullets, metal cages
and attendant tortures]{.underline}). Butler qualifies the status
afforded the Muslim "Other," [[the]{.mark} enemy of the interminable
"War on 'Terror," as a kind of **[ontological limbo]{.mark}**, one fully
admitted neither to life nor death:]{.underline}

**[If [violence]{.mark} is done [against those who are
unreal]{.mark}]{.underline}**, then, from the perspective of violence,
[**it [fails to injure or negate those lives since those lives are
already negated]{.mark}**. But they have a strange way of remaining
animated and so must be negated again]{.underline} (and again). [**[They
cannot be mourned because they]{.mark} are always already lost or,
rather, [never "were," and]{.mark} they [must be killed]{.mark}**, since
they seem to live on, stubbornly, in this state of
deadness]{.underline}... The derealization of the "Other" means that [it
is]{.underline} neither alive nor dead, but [interminably
spectral]{.underline}. (Precarious Life 33-4)

Michael Malek Najjar's gloss of Butler's concept cleanly emphasizes how
[the notion of "spectrality" ensures the endlessness of both the
paranoia of and against the Arab subject as well as the interminability
of the so-called "war" waged against the "terror" with which they are
both suddenly and transcendentally coupled]{.underline} (152). In fact,
this "war" is not only interminable; Najjar's resuscitation of Butler's
2004 framework also implies that, in a very real sense, the beginning of
this "war" in earnest is inevitably deferred, for: "[the derealization
of the Other' means that it is neither alive nor dead, but interminably
spectral"]{.underline} (Butler 33-4), an insight of Butler's that Najjar
expands to surmise that "[[**Interminable spectrality** is]{.mark} a
state where subjects are forced into a liminal position **[where]{.mark}
[they]{.mark}** are not allowed to live freely and instead **[become
victims of an infinite paranoia]{.mark}**... they are left in a state
where they cannot be freed until the socalled "war on terror" is
realized"]{.underline} (ibid, emphasis mine).

This understanding of the "war on 'terror'" as a state offensive that is
simultaneously endless and also only ever about to begin couples a
framework for racial and epistemological precarity with paradoxical
temporal inflections. That this split temporality is rife with strategic
benefit is patently obvious via the similarly contradictory ensemble of
legal neologisms its perpetuation has generated (e.g., enemy combatant,
a construct endemic to the timeless time of the "war on 'terror'" that
simultaneously marshals the full, exceptional weight of the Law against
an implicated subject that is inoculated against any of its typical
precautions). [With no fixed end---or beginning---locatable, the "war on
'terror's'" pacification prosaics enact their violence through [a
chronological assault that **exceeds the**]{.mark} **presumed
[finality]{.mark} [of notions such as]{.mark}** Fukuyama's "**[end of
history"]{.mark}**]{.underline}75 [and Jameson's cultural
"schizophrenia."]{.underline}76

[**The [players]{.mark}** in this killing farce, then, **are not only
geopolitics**, **nor racial politics**, and not even these combined with
epistemological politics alone. For the stage is also **[haunted by a
politics of time]{.mark}**, a **chronopolitics [that constellates the
workings of each of these components with fatal precision and nimble
contingency]{.mark}**.]{.underline}77 I argue that, just as the
[pacification prosaics endemic to the "war on 'terror'" are effectuated
via a politics of time, so too do security poetics likewise utilize
their own textual politics of time as a means of staging their
dissent]{.underline}. But there is a crucial distinction: while
[[the]{.mark} "[war on 'terror's" pacification prosaics are
**assembled** **around** tropes of a **single Time**,]{.mark} a
mono-Time, resistant security poetics upend this para-Time via a
temporal pluralization that is irreducible in its
complexity.]{.underline} What follows will therefore be an attempt to
illuminate the nature and significance of the chronopolitics found
within three particular texts: two plays by Ismail Khalidi---Truth Serum
Blues (2005) and Dead Are My People (2018, and still in process) and a
novel by Mohja Kahf, The Girl in the Tangerine Scarf (2006). I find it
important to note that the choice of texts is simultaneously intentional
and arbitrary, by which I mean that any number of texts with similar
topical concerns might have worked for the purposes of this analysis.
And yet, analytical intentionality is cohered through the texts'
temporal orientations (by which I refer to the date of publication for
Kahf's novel and Khalidi's earlier play, and the historical setting of
Khalidi's most recent theatrical work). On this point, I find it both
conceptually humorous and intellectually perfect that Khalidi slightly
attempted to dissuade me from using Truth Serum Blues, his first play,
within my dissertation because, as he wrote in an email, "it is nearly
fifteen years old." After all, what is a decade or more when hegemonic
registers continue to police and restrict collective access to time and
history?

Here (or now, if you will), it is necessary to sketch out some important
distinctions between time and history, though the two are certainly
interrelated. Along with "events," time is conventionally understood as
a unit of history, with the latter accommodating various strategies of
explicit reflexivity regarding the passage of time and the
transpiring---and subsequent schematization---of variously significant
occurrences. Hayden White grasped as much when he argued that
historiography is perceived as approaching the quality of "reality" the
more it reveals the trait of "narrativity,"78 that history is considered
history proper only insofar as it reveals the sequential ordering of
events over a given period into the form of a story. The implications of
this argument are, of course, a blow to the "objective" character of
history. If history is a story, or series of stories in form rather than
in essence, other stories---or "Other" stories---can be told over,
above, in between, and in place of hegemonic (hi)stories.

Of course, [history entails more of a sense of entanglement than
time]{.underline}. It is for this reason, as Eagleton notes, that it is
by no means incidental that Heidegger titled his study Being and Time
rather than Being and History:

[**[My]{.mark} own personal [history is authentically meaningful when I
accept responsibility for my own existence]{.mark}**, seize my own
future possibilities and live in enduring awareness of my own future
death]{.underline}. This may or may not be true, but it does not seem to
have any immediate relevance to how I live 'historically' in the sense
of being bound up with particular individuals, actual social relations
and concrete institutions... '**[[True' history]{.underline}]{.mark}**
for Heidegger [**is [an inward, 'authentic' or 'existential'
history]{.mark}**---a mastering of dread and nothingness, **[a
resoluteness towards death]{.mark}**, a 'gathering in' of my
powers]{.underline}---[which operates in effect as a substitute for
history in its more common and practical senses.]{.underline} As...
Georg Lukács put it, Heidegger's famous 'historicity' is not really
distinguishable from ahistoricity. (57)

Yet even as history implies more of a sense of interrelatedness and
complicity to others, its [narrativation can retain a hegemonic,
exclusionary function]{.underline}. C. Riley Snorton describes the
implications that race and racialization have for these conversations in
building upon the insights of Tavia Nyong'o:

\[O\]ne might also consider that race is a history of theory that
functions to express what is un/thinkable across complex
temporalities... history becomes less a program for examining change
over time and more an examination in disruptions in linear time. Race,
then, becomes a way of thinking history doubly, or of thinking about the
history of historicity. (Black on Both Sides 8)

[The **[security poetics]{.mark}** employed]{.underline} by writers
under analysis in this chapter, then, [are under a double-bind: on the
one hand, they must challenge the presentist exceptionalism of the "war
on 'terror's'" pacification prosaics. But in doing so, they must also be
careful not to reinscribe hegemonic historical narritivations that evade
"disruptions in linear time."]{.underline} Rather, [their challenges
**[must simultaneously dismantle artificial temporal exceptions and
overly-exclusive conceptions of temporality and
history.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The preceding comments suggest how the "war on 'terror'" insinuates a
perpetual present vis-à-vis derealization. Perhaps naturally enough, if
a perpetual present is what is at issue, the solution might seem to be a
historicization of this perpetual present. Yet a few further comments on
the chronopolitics of both the "war on 'terror'" as well as dissenting
literatures will help clarify why this would be an ultimately misguided
endeavor, according to the terms of this analysis.

[The "war on 'terror'" edifies its perpetual present via several
temporal technologies]{.underline}, the first of which I am presently
terming "**[[terrorist exceptionalization]{.underline}]{.mark}**."
Simply put, [this refers to the phenomenon by which the currently
racialized figure of the "terrorist" **[is imbued with a transhistorical
omniscience]{.mark}**, conscripted as [**an "enemy combatant" of
fearsome existential proportions** and]{.mark} the subsequent [ability
to upend]{.mark} not only individual (white, "freedom loving"/"dutiful
citizen") life, but also **to** rend the very fabric of [**hegemonic
Western democratic "enlightened" civilization** beyond]{.mark}
[repair]{.mark}. A symptomatic reading of the current terms of
presentist racial-imperial anxiety make these dimensions evident
enough.]{.underline} But equally as important as the current
adumbrations of terrorist exceptionalization is a consideration of the
forms it has taken in the past. For example, though [the so-called
"Islamic fundamentalist" is inextricable from the category of
"terrorist"]{.underline} today, 19th century [American racial anxieties
told a far different story, one of Eastern Europeans with dynamite
ever-ready to obliterate key sites of capitalist
production]{.underline}. For this reason, Jeffory Clymer argues,
racialized anxieties about "terrorism" are indissociable from paranoid
vigilance surrounding the integrity of the capitalist system (America's
Culture of Terrorism 13). Furthermore, even following intense government
scrutiny of Arab- and Arab American activism and uprising during the
Cold War era, Sarah Gualtieri importantly reminds us that [[**Arab
American** activists]{.mark} such as the members of the Association of
Arab American University Graduates (AAUG) were **[accused of being
"godless communists"]{.mark}** for their championing of the Palestinian
freedom struggle, while today they would be far more likely to be
condemned as "Muslim terrorists"]{.underline} (Between Arab and White
173[). **[The "terrorist,"]{.underline}**]{.mark} [then, is not and
**[never has been transhistorically coherent, but rather contingently
overdetermined by capitalist, geopolitical and racial fixations and
anxieties.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Related to terrorist exceptionalization is another cultural technology
of the "war on 'terror'" that I refer to as "Muslim Exceptionalization."
Here I refer to the "war on 'terror's'" current occlusion of Muslim
identity that historically preceded post WWII Arab immigration, spanning
all the way back to Antebellum Muslim slave identity as well as the
activism of organizations such as the Nation of Islam during the Black
Power movement. The negative idealization of the "terrorist" as
ultimately Arab, even while it does not exculpate Black bodies from
ongoing interpellation into the framework of "terrorism,"79 nevertheless
symbolically levels important histories of resistance, thereby
fracturing the capacity for dissenting collectivities to more naturally
gravitate towards mutual uplift and joint struggle.80

[The final cultural technology of relevance for this investigation is
what I am terming "securitization's disciplinary tautology." This
concept is intended to capture the more individualized leveling of past
and present that occurs when the charge of "terrorism" is deployed
against a suspect. **[By way of a strategic, syntactical inversion, the
objectified subject of such a charge is suddenly deprived of any
narrational or temporal recourse for exculpation]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Any and all responses to the charge merely confirm its elastic accuracy.
For, according to this disciplinary tautology: [one already always-was a
"terrorist" because one is accused. One is accused because one already
always-was a "terrorist."]{.underline}

I opt for the term disfiguring in place of historicizing to refer to
these text's resistance to the "war on 'terror's" chronopolitics because
to claim these texts "historicize" would be to imply one single,
coherent notion of time and history, a construct these texts in fact
elude and destabilize as part of their imaginative insurgency.
Disfiguring simultaneously both the possibility of "disfigurement"---of
scarring the illusionary veneer of the perpetual present to reveal
glimpses of the time-worlds surging beneath---as well as "figuring,"
meaning a textual representation of the "war on 'terror's" temporal
assaults.

In the context of The Cancer Journals, she intimates that writing about
her experiences with breast cancer, including the patterned harms that
she underwent within the clinical setting, is vital to her own survival
and to the survival of other Black women. Additionally, "know\[ing\]
without understanding" appears to refer to the inchoate existential
awareness of one's own sensations, emotions, and other embodied
experiences, experiences that are not fully transparent to oneself or
others. According to Lorde, the act of bringing such pre- or
non-discursive forms of awareness, including experiences of pain and
illness, into expression becomes a method to reshape personal and
collective possibilities. On this point, Therí A. Pickens (2014) notes
that Lorde "wrestles with the appropriate ethical response to her pain"
and configures her writings as a means "to move toward awareness,
discussion, and activism" (130--131). The importance of highlighting
such a relationship between pain and expression is that Lorde is able to
demonstrate the many ways in which Black lesbian women struggle through
cancer and amputation. Among the themes that emerge in Lorde's work is
the dominance of the medical establishment over patients' own narrative
descriptions. Thus, describing her pain through evocations of joy and
sensuality, including phantom pains, becomes a resistant act against the
power of clinical medicine's force relations. For example, after her
mastectomy, Lorde writes that "the pain returned home bringing all of
its kinfolk" (Lorde 2014, 31--32). Through drawing on familiar
vernacular, Lorde's description serves as a response to the
insufficiency of medical discourses to describe the experiences of Black
American women in pain (Pickens 2014, 132). The Cancer Journals also
underscores Lorde's decision not to wear a prosthesis following her
mastectomy. Specifically, nurses and volunteer staff encourage her to
wear a pink prosthetic breast following her surgery, and the reasons
offered are that such a prosthesis will make Lorde and others around her
feel more comfortable (1980, 42). The artificiality of the pink
prosthetic contrasts with Lorde's descriptions of her own "soft brown
skin" after surgery, and her remarks critique the white aesthetic norms
that exist within biomedical technologies of the flesh (44). Pickens
also notes the heteronormative encounters Lorde describes while being
encouraged to wear the prosthesis, including the suggestions by medical
staff that wearing the prosthesis would allow her to remain attractive
to men (2014, 135). In [these ways, Lorde's writings refuse these
tendencies to foreclose her own appreciation of her body and desires,
and her descriptions reopen a discursive space for a distinctively Black
lesbian response to]{.underline} 238 Andrea J. Pitts [the
misunderstandings and erasures that stem from the medical world around
her.]{.underline} As such, [Lorde's writings offer a counternarrative to
the whiteness of clinical medicine, and provide a descriptive opening
for the existential conditions of illness, pain, and pathologization
experienced by queer women of color]{.underline}. [Alongside the pivotal
work by Black, Indigenous, and other women of color in the 1970s and
1980s, [more recent scholarly and activist work operating through
framings of disability justice has focused on the specific existential
and conceptual tools necessary for disabled, queer and trans people of
color]{.mark}.]{.underline} [For example, although [authors like Lorde
and Gloria Anzaldúa]{.mark} wrote extensively of experiences of illness,
medical intervention, pain, and blindness, these authors [were]{.mark}
often [reluctant to interpret themselves in terms of]{.mark}
"disability" or as "[disabled]{.mark}."]{.underline} [Along these lines,
Moya Bailey and Izetta Autumn Mobley (2019) and Aurora Levins Morales
(2013) have respectively explored the relationships between race and
disability, examining the reasons [why people of color]{.mark} may
[choose not to politically organize]{.mark} around disability rights or
[through identification as "disabled]{.mark}."]{.underline} Namely,
[Bailey and Mobley note that [tropes]{.mark} [of the "crazy Black woman"
are weaponized against Black women leading to high rates of violence
committed against them]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and that such violence
occurs while simultaneously failing to address the needs of Black people
with psychiatric or physical disabilities]{.underline} (2019, 31).
Additionally, they point out that: [Black women and other women of color
do most of the labor in the service of disability despite the impact on
their ability to care for themselves or their families.]{.underline}
Caregivers are often engaged in debilitating work for disabled people
and become disabled themselves. (32) [These concerns, along with others,
may thus complicate political and personal mobilization through a
framing of disability for people of color]{.underline}. Bailey and
Mobley also note, however, that growing work is currently being done
among Black authors and activists to explore the terms of a disability
within Black communities, including as their work attests, developing a
Black feminist disability framework from which to theorize and mobilize.
Along similar lines, Morales notes that for Gloria Anzaldúa, as a
"dark-skinned working class Tejana lesbian," [to have affirmed
disability as an identity would likely have required "a strong, vocal,
politically sophisticated, disability justice movement led by queer
working class women and trans people of color who understood \[her\]
life]{.underline}" (2013, 5). From this insight, Bailey and Mobley, as
well as [[disability justice activists have resisted individualist
rights]{.mark}- and autonomy-based models of justice [to focus on
collective resistance to ableism in its many
instantiations]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Instead,
[disability]{.mark} justice [activists]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[scholars]{.mark} [demand a recognition of the interdependence of shared
struggles against systemic oppressions and how disability functions
across all forms of oppression]{.mark}---all of this while foregrounding
the desires, joys, and networks of care among disabled people who are
fighting against those systemic oppressions]{.underline}. [For example,
disability justice organizers [Talila A. Lewis]{.mark} [and Dustin P.
Gibson]{.mark}, through their social media, workshops, and collective
public actions, [offer powerful critiques of the forms of systemic
ableism that undergird US prison systems and policing]{.mark}, while
also dedicating time and energy to curate Black disability solidarity
music, art, film, and history]{.underline} (Lewis 2020; Gibson 2020).
Additionally, Sins Invalid, founded in 2005 by [disability justice
activists Patty Berne and LeRoy F. Moore, is a performance-based artist
collective composed of artists of Disability Bioethics and Race 239
color and LGBTQ/gender-variant artists that explores themes of
sexuality, the non-normative body, and social and economic justice
through their performances and workshops]{.underline} (Sins Invalid
2020). [These [examples of disability justice]{.mark} activism thus
[illustrate]{.mark} the important point made by Bailey and Mobley that
there are creative aesthetic, embodied, and political contributions
founded in the experiences of disabled people of color, and [that
organizing]{.mark} work [done within a disability justice
framework]{.mark} [celebrates both the lives and experiences of disabled
people of color while also critiquing the very systematic patterns of
harm]{.mark} that would seek to erase, reduce, or eliminate their very
existence.]{.underline} Lastly, regarding the relationship between
disability and race, Nirmala Erevelles (2011) explores the
"racialization of disability" and the "dis-abilization of race," a
process that Erevelles offers to bring both categories into material
relation. Specifically, she argues that [[whiteness]{.mark}, defended as
a form of property right, is "the ideological discourse that [has been
used to justify the racial superiority of white people]{.mark} over
people of color by [using the logic of dis-ability]{.mark}]{.underline}
(e.g., inferior genes, low IQ) [to decide who has the rights to
citizenship]{.underline}" (166). By this, Erevelles suggests that [the
racialization of disability is the process by which white, able-bodied
heterosexual cisgender men become centered as the most productive (and
thereby valuable) citizens within capitalist societies]{.underline}. In
this, the productive possibilities of such white citizens are protected
through institutions such as the law, education, and health care.
[Regarding education, for example, the criminalization and
pathologization of Black children in k-12 settings, as well as the
segregation of educational institutions by "cognitive ability" seeks to
shore up protected educational resources for those deemed more deserving
or more capable of making "positive" contributions to
society]{.underline}. Regarding the dis-abilization of race, Erevelles
notes that [people considered outside the productive metrics of advanced
capitalism are often relegated to the welfare state, and thereby
stigmatized as burdensome on the civic body.]{.underline} The responses
to such so-called "dependency" on social welfare programs, however, is
also a lucrative business, she argues. Testing companies, metrics and
measurements for success, juvenile detention facilities, and other
programs designed to manage or "uplift" children of color effectively
foreground a life marked by pathologization and deviance for many
people. Moreover, Erevelles proposes that the debilitating conditions of
labor for many people of color in the USA also lead to increased
marginalization, vulnerability, and medical precarity for such
populations within advanced capitalism.

#### Blackness and disability exist in a state of becoming; through the transatlantic slave trade, ability has intrinsically been tied to whiteness and disability to blackness. We should treat these as aligned instead of antagonistic to one another.

[In Hortense Spillers's (1987) essay, "Mama's Baby, Papa's Maybe," the
social context in which the embodied subject becomes-in-the-world is one
suffused with an ineffaceable horror.]{.underline} [Spillers, in this
essay, locates the "origins" of African American subjectivity in the
(trans)Atlantic slave trade, which starts with the unimaginable violence
during the Middle Passage; continues through the dehumanization of
slavery; and finally concludes by exposing dominant conceptualizations
of the contemporary "Black Family" as a tangle of
pathology.]{.underline} [Her analysis pierces the body to expose "the
hieroglyphics of the flesh" whose "undecipherable markings" become the
cornerstone of an American Grammar that continues to this day to deny
the [African American his/her subjectivity, such that his/her body
"becomes both the physical and biological expression of otherness . . .
becoming both physically and generally powerless]{.mark}]{.underline}"
(p. 67). In this section, I [argue **[that Spillers's essay is as much
about disability as it is about race, even though the word "disability"
is not mentioned even once in her essay]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I [find
this startling because the "scene\[s\] of actual mutilation,
dismemberment, and exile" (p. 67) that Spillers describes in her essay
produce disabled bodies---black disabled bodies---who in an ironic turn
are transformed into commodities that are exchanged in the market or
profit. I call this ironic because the dominant paradigm has conceived
of disabled bodies as having little economic value except in very
limited contexts where their extra-ordinariness was made hypervisible,
as for example, in the freak shows---another profitable
venture]{.underline} (Adams, 2001; Bogdan, 1988). In S[pillers's essay,
on the other hand, it is in becoming disabled that the black body is at
the height of its profitability, and it is the historical, social, and
economic context of this becoming that I will now foreground in this
section.]{.underline}

Before I undertake this analysis, however[, I want to distinguish my
position from other positions that have theorized the relationship
between race and disability.]{.underline} For the most part[, race for
disability scholars and disability for race scholars are conceived of as
"prosthetic metaphor\[s\]"]{.underline} (Barker & Murray, 2010, p. 219).
In race studies scholarship[, Ewart (2010) calls this practice "dis
appropriation," where the language of disability is used "to affirm (an
often-subordinate) voice to elucidate agency and figurative empathy for
other oppressed and exploited populations"]{.underline} (p. 152). In
disability studies scholarship, [disability oppression/struggle is
equated with racial oppression/struggle]{.underline} (James & Wu, 2006).
[In each of these cases, [both disability and race are conceived of as
tropes that can be used interchangeably to foreground the ubiquity of
oppression, but that **fail to explore the complex ways in which "the
categories of race/ethnicity and disability are used to constitute one
another or the ways that those social, political, and cultural practices
have kept seemingly different groups of people in strikingly similar
marginalized positions"**]{.mark}]{.underline} (James & Wu, 2006, p. 4).
Conscious of this critique, in this section, I will [show how race and
disability are imbricated in their collective formation of the black
disabled body that now becomes a commodity that has economic, social,
cultural, and linguistic implications for transnational
subjectivities.]{.underline}

As mentioned earlier, Spillers's essay does not follow normative ways of
engaging both disability and race because disability is never actually
mentioned in her essay. [Instead, Spillers focuses on the deliberate and
violent process by which the black body is transformed into a
commodity--- without gender, without genitalia, without subjectivity---a
commodity so abject that it exists even outside kinship
relations]{.underline} (the most fundamental of social units), [such
that, in another ironic twist, its very aimlessness constitutes it as
"an effective social and economic agent"]{.underline} (p. 74[). I
[underscore both the historical and economic contexts here that are
instrumental in the body becoming both racialized and disabled]{.mark}.
I want to stress here that my argument is not that disability is like
race or that race is like disability]{.underline}. Rather, I am arguing
that within the [specific transnational conditions of
colonialism/neocolonialism, the **[becoming of black disabled bodies is
indeed an intercorporeal phenomenon that foregrounds a violent
hierarchical context that contemporary theorists of difference have been
reluctant to address or even acknowledge]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Spillers's essay begins (and I use this verb very tentatively) in the
fifteenth century, in the initial encounters between European
adventurers and West Africans, as culled from the 1789 narrative of the
Nigerian Olaudau Equiano or Gustavus Vassa and the Portuguese Gomes
Eannes de Azurara's chronicle of the discovery and conquest of Guinea,
1441--1448. In both narratives, written from entirely different
perspectives, the initial encounter between the Self and its Other
produced the shocked recognition of radical difference. In these initial
encounters, "white men with horrible looks, red faces, and long hair"
(Equiano as quoted in Spillers, 1987, p. 67) came face to face with men
and women "black as Ethiops, and so ugly, both in features and in body,
as almost to appear (to those who saw them) the images of a lower
hemisphere" (1: 28; De Azurara as quoted in Spillers, 1987, p. 70)

[The sociocultural and psychic horror expressed by the Self when brought
face to face with the monstrous Other mimics Julia Kristeva's (1982)
argument that the abject inspires an irrational fear of engulfment
and/or contamination]{.underline}. And, at face value, it would appear
that both parties are guilty of this horror. However, as [Spillers is
quick to point out, this notion of simultaneous/mutual horror is a
solipsism that conceals a more brutal reality---the intention of the One
to subjugate the Other on the basis of difference perceived in skin
color]{.underline}. To the ship crew of mostly European men, tho[se
bodies, "black as Ethiops and so ugly, both in features and in body,"
were nothing more than cargo to be transported to the New World by sea,
and to be traded for unimaginable profit because of their obvious
"physical" impairments." It is at this moment that the conceptualization
of black subjectivity as impaired subjectivity is neither accidental nor
should it be conceived of as merely metaphorical.]{.underline} [Rather,
it is precisely at the historical moment when [one class of human beings
was transformed into cargo]{.mark} to be [transported to the New World
that black bodies become **disabled and disabled bodies become
black**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Further, it is also [important to note
that blackness itself does not stand in for skin colo]{.underline}r.
After all, in his chronicle, de Azurara recognizes that "in the field of
captives, some of the observed are 'white enough, fair to look upon, and
well-proportioned' \[while\] Others are less 'white like mulattoes'"
(Spillers, 1987, p. 70). In other words[, black and disabled are not
just linguistic tropes used to delineate difference, but are, instead,
materialist constructs produced for the appropriation of profit in a
historical context where black disabled bodies were subjected to the
most brutal violence.]{.underline}

[The other factor to recognize in these [flesh-and-blood encounters of
intercorporeality,]{.mark} which Shildrick celebrates in her own work,
is that [both blackness and disability are mutually constitutive on
account of this social violence**. Here, disability is again not just a
linguistic trope, but the actual bloodied markings on the black
body**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Spillers cites William Goodell's account of
North American slave codes that expose this brutal violation of black
flesh: "The smack of the whip is all day long in the ears of those who
are on the plantation, or in the vicinity; and it is used with such
dexterity and severity as not only to lacerate the skin, but to tear out
small portions of the flesh at almost every stake." The anatomical
specifications of rupture, of altered human tissue, take on the
objective description of laboratory prose---eyes beaten out, arms,
backs, skulls branded, a left jaw, a right ankle, punctured; teeth
missing, as the calculated work of iron, whips, chains, knives, the
canine patrol, the bullet. (p. 67)

While [Spillers describes these markings on the flesh as "the
concentration of ethnicity" in a culture "whose state apparatus,
including judges, attorneys, 'owners,' 'soul drivers,' 'overseers,' and
'men of God,' apparently colludes with a protocol of 'search and
destroy'" (p]{.underline}. 67), [I argue that these [same markings on
the flesh]{.mark}, quite simply, also [produce]{.mark}
[impairment]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Here, [**impairment [is not
just biological/natural, it is also produced in a historical, social,
and economic cont]{.mark}ext,** where the very [embodiment of
blackness]{.mark} and [disability]{.mark}]{.underline} "[bears in person
the marks of a cultural text whose inside has been turned
outside"]{.underline} (p. 67). Here too, Rosemarie Garland-[Thomson's
(2002) depiction of disability as the set of practices that produce
disabled/nondisabled bodies via a system of interpreting and
disciplining bodily variation takes a brutally violent
turn]{.underline}.

[When the imbrication of blackness and disability produce violent
markings on enslaved bodies, the assault on enslaved subjectivities is
profound.]{.underline} Take, for example, one historical account cited
by Spillers, which describes the detailed specifications provided as
instruction to the crew of one of the most famous ships associated with
the Middle Passage ( The Brookes ) on how to most profitably cram its
human cargo on board: "Let it now be supposed . . . further, that every
man slave is to be allowed six feet by one foot four inches for room,
every woman five feet ten by one foot four, every boy five feet by one
foot two, and every girl four feet six by one foot . . . " The owner of
The Brookes , James Jones, had recommended that "five females be
reckoned as four males, and three boys or girls as equal to two grown
persons." (p. 72)

[Instructed with much mathematical precision, [bodily boundaries
collapse and collide, stretch and]{.mark} shrink.]{.underline} The
[categorical permeability of boundaries has scant regard for the
sovereign subject, because complex computations of equivalency are not
bound by bodily limits.]{.underline} And yet, it is **[[difficult to
celebrate the fragility, malleability, and instability of these bodily
boundaries borne out of so much violence as either transgressive or
transformative]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Rather, more profoundly, the
intercorporeal permeability between these un-gendered, un-named, and
un-remarkable bodies (except for their economic value as cargo) only
serve to further erode any form of subjectivity that these bodies could

nascent colonialist transnational expansion of capitalism are
[responsible]{.mark} for the [violent]{.mark} [reconfiguration of the
flesh,]{.mark} such that it becomes almost impossible to claim the
sovereign subject, now **[mutually constituted via race, disability, and
gender as a dehumanized commodity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [And yet, even
though the deconstruction of the sovereign subject is cause for
celebration**, [how does one celebrate in the face of so much violated
and wounded flesh?]{.mark}**]{.underline}

"Spirit Murder" and the "New" Eugenics: Critical Race Theory meets
Disability Studies

[The three stories of Eleanor Bumpurs, Junius Wilson, and Cassie and
Aliya Smith, however poignant they may appear to be, are not
unique]{.underline}. [[Police brutality, false imprisonment, and
educational negligence are commonplace in the lives of people of
color--- especially those who are located at the margins of multiple-
identity categorie]{.mark}s]{.underline}. So [common are these practices
that CRF scholar Patricia Williams (1997) has argued that these [kinds
of assaults should not be dismissed as the "odd
mistake]{.mark}."]{.underline} On the other hand, Willia[ms has argued
that that these "[mistakes]{.mark}" be given a [name]{.mark} that
associates them with criminality.]{.underline} [Her term]{.underline}
for such assaults on an individual's personhood is "[[spirit
murder,"]{.underline}]{.mark} which [she describes as
follows:]{.underline} [I see spirit murder as no less than the
equivalent of body murder . . . One of the reasons I fear what I call
spirit murder or disregard for others whose lives qualitatively depend
on our regard, is that its product is a system of formalized distortions
of thought[.]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[It produces social structures
centered around fear and hate, it provides a timorous outlet for
feelings elsewhere unexpressed]{.underline}**]{.mark} . . . We need to
see it as a cultural cancer; we need to open our eyes to the spiritual
genocide it is wreaking on blacks, whites, and the abandoned and abused
of all races and ages. [[We]{.mark} [need to eradicate its numbing
pathology]{.mark} before it wipes out what precious little humanity we
have left]{.underline}. (p. 234)

Clearly, [in our educational institutions, there are millions of
students of color, mostly [economically disadvantaged and
disabled]{.mark}, for whom "[spirit murder" is the most significant
experience in their educational lives.]{.mark} In fact, it is this
recognition of "[spirit murder]{.mark}" in the everyday lives of
disabled students of color that forges a [critical link between
disability studies and CRT/F through the intercategorical analysis of
intersectionalit]{.mark}y. In]{.underline} other words, [utilizing an
intercategorical analysis from the critical standpoint of disability
studies will foreground the structural forces in place in schools that
disregard students who are perceived as disruptive to the dominant
ideologies that shore up the mythical norm. That most of the students
are poor, disabled, and of color is critical to recognize from within a
CRT/F perspective, because the implications these exclusions have on the
community of color as a whole are disastrous]{.underline}. [By failing
to undertake such an analysis, we could miss several political
opportunities for transformative action.]{.underline} For example,
Connor and Ferri (2005) raise some critical questions regarding one of
education's most famous court cases, Brown v. Board of Education:

Why did supporters of Brown not recognize how the assigned status of
"disability" could serve as a mechanism for resegregating students of
color in otherwise desegregated schools? [And why did special education
fail to take into account the intersection of race and disability and,
thus undermine the goals of the Brown decision?]{.underline} (p. 121)

Now that we have the benefit of hindsight, we need to move forward.
Connor and Ferri's questions [require that we pay close attention to
reading race and disability **[not through an additive/comparative lens,
but by deploying an intersectional analysis that seeks to understand and
transform the structures where power coheres in complex yet dangerous
ways]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [It requires that critical
educators plant themselves firmly at the intersections of multiple
differences to submit our educational institutions to a ruthless
critique of the status quo]{.underline}.

In the context of our argument, these are some of the questions that
should be raised by all critical educators: What role do disability
labels play in public school settings? Why should parents and educators
of color be active participants in advocating special education reform
in public schools? Why should parents active in the disability rights
movement also foreground the racial dimensions of special education
reform? Why should parents of color, parents of students with
disabilities, and parents from economically disadvantaged backgrounds,
and parents who live at all these intersections work together to
radically transform schools?

[One of the largest problems in the special education movement is that
parent advocates usually deploy the individualist model when fighting
for their children. Both [CRT/F and disability studies scholarship point
to the social/political context in which families are **situated** in
relationship to educational institutio]{.mark}ns]{.underline}. It is
these contexts that have real effects on the families and those
individuals caught at these intersections. The history of the civil
rights movement was successful because of community advocacy. [At the
intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability, we will
find that collective resistance is more fruitful than individualized
forms of resistance.]{.underline}

[The need for change has never been more pressing than now]{.underline}.
[Even as we write this **chapter[, there may be yet another Eleanor
Bumpurs, Junius Wilson, or Cassie Smith, whose life is quite literally
on the line]{.mark}**. If [we allow eugenic- like ideologies to continue
to plague our institutions]{.mark} (legal, rehabilitational, and
educational), we will be required to face the consequences.]{.underline}
In the Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison's famous book Beloved , she
evocatively describes how we can never escape history because it will
continue to speak to us in haunting tones until we listen, atone, and
transform ourselves. Rather than viewing it as a threat, we argue that
there is hope in this assertion. [Patricia Williams (1997) herself also
echoes Morrison's call to all of us educators to heed the voices of
those who are innocently sacrificed at the altar of educational
expediency. She writes:]{.underline}

[The legacy of killing finds its way into cultural expectations,
archetypes, and "isms.]{.underline}" **[[The echoes of both the dead and
deadly others acquire a hallucinatory quality; their voices speak of an
unwanted past, but also reflect for us images of the future. Today's
world condemns those voices as superstitious and paranoid. Neglected
they speak from the shadows of such inattention, in garbles and growls,
in the tongues of the damned and the insane . . . So- called
unenlightened others who fail to listen to the voices of demonic selves,
made invisibly uncivilized, simply make them larger, more barbarously
enraged, until the nearsightedness of looking glass existence is smashed
in upon by the terrible dispossession of dreams too long
deferred.]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Williams, 1997, p. 235).

I use the term [**neo--slave narrative** to refer to a broad range of
post Emancipation fictionalized representations of slavery]{.underline}.
[Unlike traditional slave narratives, which sought to use consciously
constructed personal narratives to promote the abolitionist cause,
neo--slave narratives are often viewed as attempts to recover or
rediscover aspects of slaves' experiences that were not included in
traditional slave narratives]{.underline}. [**[Neo--slave
narratives]{.underline}**,]{.mark} therefore, [use history to
**[(re)construct experiences]{.mark}** of slavery [and **affectively
(re)connect contemporary individuals** to slavery in ways]{.mark} that
[the less literary, nongraphic, and highly pragmatic traditional]{.mark}
slave [narratives]{.mark} often [cannot]{.mark}.]{.underline} Despite
this recovery element, neo--slave narratives also recognize that due to
the marginalized position of slaves and lack of access to independent
publishing and education, traditional historical methods of archival
research do not necessarily produce new information. As Madhu Dubey
argues, [neo--slave narratives "**[situate themselves against
history]{.mark}**, suggesting that we can best comprehend the truth of
slavery [by **abandoning historical modes of
knowing**]{.mark}"]{.underline} ("Speculative Fictions of Slavery" 784).
In fact, many [neo--slave narratives [blur fact and fiction]{.mark} in
order [to comment]{.mark} on [and challenge our]{.mark} [ability to read
any history of slavery]{.mark}]{.underline}---[including slave
narratives]{.underline}--- [as unadulterated truth]{.underline},
encouraging us instead to consider history, especially histories of
marginalized people, as inherently partial, flawed, and filtered through
human interpretation. The use of metaphor and nonrealism are both
essential to this counter- (rather than anti-) historical task of the
neo--slave narrative genre.

Since the publication of Kindred in 1979, which "set the tone for much
subsequent fiction about slavery," this reconstructive task of reading
against the historical grain is often performed through a variety of
nonrealist devices, including the disruption of traditional linear
narrative, ghost stories, and time travel (Ryan 18).5 [The change to
nonrealist representations of slavery is an important difference between
neo--slave narratives and traditional slave narratives because the
traditional narratives relied on realism to underscore the authenticity,
truthfulness, and trustworthiness of the narrative and
narrator.]{.underline}6 Hayden White writes that [both history and
fiction depend on the distinction between the real and the
imaginary]{.underline}. She contends that in order for a text, like a
traditional slave narrative, to be understood as true and real in modern
discourse, it must "possess the character of narrativity" (H. White 10).
As a result of this connection between traditional forms of narrative
and truth, our notions of the real, both in historical and fictional
texts, depend on concepts of continuity, chronology, and causality.
**[[Neo--slave narratives]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however,
**[[use]{.mark} speculative [fictional devices to refuse]{.mark}
traditional [narrative modes and]{.mark} thus also [reject traditional
notions of what constitutes the real]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These
literary devices that disrupt temporality and narrativity "are designed
to convey certain truths about slavery that are inaccessible through the
discipline of history" (Dubey, "Speculative Fictions of Slavery" 791).
Speculative fictional neo--slave narratives therefore work to reclaim
lost voices, to critique traditional historical methods associated with
white, nondisabled men, and to use fiction and nonrealism to expose many
of the untruths and absences of the historical record and cultural
memory of slavery

In addition to being nonrealist, contemporary [[neo]{.mark}--slave
[narratives]{.mark} also [have a **different relationship to
(dis)ability**]{.mark} than traditional slave narratives]{.underline}.
Sherryl Vint writes that traditional "[slave narratives aimed to show
their black protagonists' humanity, they required the **demonstration of
bodily suffering to guarantee authenticity** and to spur the reader into
sympathy, **yet** they also needed to avoid **reducing the narrating
subject to his or her suffering body**"]{.underline} ("'Only by
Experience'" 244). [The desire to [**demonstrate suffering without being
reduced** to such suffering]{.mark} in [a traditional]{.mark} slave
[narrative]{.mark} **[depends]{.mark} [on]{.mark} keeping [the
possibility of recovery, healing, and redemption]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(through the ending of slavery) open and viable.7 [This distinction
between the suffering, but **recoverable** black subject **versus** the
**suffering** black subject **reduced** to a suffering (and thus
**irrecoverable**) bodymind **can be read as a distinction between
nondisabled and disabled black people**.]{.underline} Here, [only a
nondisabled slave narrator presents the possibility of recouping black
subjects by ending slavery because the suffering and otherwise disabling
circumstances are represented as solely resulting from the slave
system]{.underline}. A disabled narrator could easily be interpreted by
readers as evidence of the permanent damage done to black people by
slavery (or their inherent inabilities regardless of enslavement or not)
and the impossibility of incorporating black people into full
citizenship, a concept that is traditionally imbued with assumptions of
ability.8 [**[A traditional slave narrative could not]{.mark}**,
therefore, **[fully]{.mark} [detail the violence of slavery]{.mark}**,
which disabled so many people without jeopardizing its pragmatic
purpose]{.underline}.

In the antebellum period, a slave narrator could not, within the
discursive limits of that sociopolitical context, make a claim to
rationality, morality, and citizenship while also claiming disability.
[Since disability and intellectual and moral capacity were viewed in
opposition, even if an author had a disability it would not be
represented in a traditional slave narrative as central to their
personhood or experience]{.underline}. The [two major exceptions to this
representational absence are, one, when disability is represented as an
effect of slavery on another person who is not the author and is then
used as an example of the evils of the slave system, and, two, when
disability is represented with the narrator, but cured, erased, or
overcome in freedom]{.underline}.9 Even then, however, such
representations had to be limited since emphasizing the disablement of
black people at large could, once again, limit collective group claims
to the rationality, morality, and citizenship denied black subjects
during this period. [[**Contemporary neo--slave narratives**]{.mark} do
not have the same pragmatic, discursive, or editorial limits and
**[are]{.mark}** therefore **[able to represent disability]{.mark} both
[as]{.mark} part of [the reality of slavery and]{.mark} as a [central
aspect of an individual's lived bodymind
experience]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In addition to Kindred, other
neo--slave narratives that represent disability include Alex Haley's
Roots, Toni Morrison's Beloved, Phyllis Alesia Perry's Stigmata,
Margaret Walker's Jubilee, Edward P. Jones's The Known World, James
McBride's Song Yet Sung, and Marie-Elena John's Unburnable. Despite the
fact that disability in neo--slave narratives could be read as evidence
of the violence against black people in the antebellum period,
[**[representations of disabled bodyminds]{.mark} in neo--slave
narratives [are]{.mark}** primarily **[interpreted as metaphors]{.mark}
for** the impact of **racism**, whether historically, contemporarily, or
both.]{.underline}

Blackness", Duke University Press, Durham and London, pgs. 95-96, JMH\]

As an inroad to an ending, [[I turn to the issue of whether Black
madness and mad Blackness must have meaning and what that meaning must
be. I disambiguate meaning and value]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The former
is how a concept makes sense in or has an impact on public or private
space. The latter concerns an affective and sociocultural conception of
relative merit or perceived worth in public or private
space]{.underline}. In the introduction to this volume, [I called this
line of inquiry an act of literary theorist blasphemy because it upturns
one of the basic assumptions of literary criticism: namely, that certain
concepts must continue to be impactful or that those concepts must make
sense in a text, that they are available to be read and
understood]{.underline}. Yet, this kind of inquiry has a long history in
Black studies and disability studies. Scholarly interventions regarding
Blackness and madness call into question the utility of both meaning and
value. That is, [[disability]{.mark} studies [and critical race studies
attend to the ways that devaluation of Blackness and
madness]{.mark}---legally, socially, culturally,
historically---[contribute to the thinking of these identities as
abject]{.mark}. This is not simply about whether these subjects remain
in a position of abjection but rather about sorting through the
conditions that make that meaning shift. The political impetus is that
one cannot have a different meaning unless the value ascribed changes.
The lives of mad people matter. Black lives matter. **[According]{.mark}
[to a linear progressive view of history, as the value of Blackness and
madness increase, the abjection ascribed to them will dissipate or go
away altogether]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Indeed, [the fiction of
postracial discourse is that we are/ were currently in this/that
cultural moment.]{.underline} (The operative word here is fiction.) [The
conversations before this moment reveal that the artists-theorists
discussed in this volume provide useful disruptions to linear time and
progressive narratives.]{.underline} In drawing an intellectual
cartography, **[[this project lays bare how these artists-theorists
trouble the stativity of those ideas and, in their dynamic theorizing,
intervene in the commonly held discourses about Blackness and
madness]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As I warned, this map would uncover,
recover, and discover, at times, contradictory relationships in the
folds, lingering in the cut. A [small bit of redistricting: Octavia E.
Butler's work wonders whether mutual constitution functions as an adroit
reading strategy]{.underline}. Nalo Hopkinson suggests the intraracial
space may offer some disruptive aesthetic and narrative potential, which
challenges Butler without dismissing the possibility for new
interpretative strategy. Tananarive Due's heuristic queries how either
of the worlds Butler and Hopkinson craft became possible given the
ideological concept of the human. **[Each [conversation
intertwines]{.mark} with the other [to examine the fissures in our
analyses of Blackness and madness.]{.mark} As a result, [they raise
questions about the sought after goals of understanding these
narratives]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In what follows, [I endeavor to do
what is perhaps impolite at the end of a conversation: crawl under the
discussion to retrace a thread that subtends but possibly upends the
entire enterprise. I ask, if the value of Black madness and mad
Blackness increases, do Black madness and/or mad Blackness retain the
same meanings?]{.underline}

[[Disability and the Enslaved Body]{.mark} [The relationship between
disability, race and slavery in the colonial period was not just one of
representation; rather, disfi gurement and impairment were routine
results of enslavement in the British
Caribbean]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[From]{.mark} the very
[moment]{.mark} [of seizure in]{.mark} subSaharan Africa, [enslaved
bodies were methodically marked with slavery's
violence.]{.mark}]{.underline} [The process of capture, forced march,
imprisonment and forced migration that characterised the slave trade,
and the physical effects of forced labour in sugar production,
malnutrition, disease and legally sanctioned punishments which
characterised British Caribbean plantations, often resulted in long-term
emotional and physical damage. For [captives who survived the passage
and years of 'seasoning', disfi gurement, disease and impairment came to
characterise their lives---they were '**kept alive but in a state of
injury** , in a phantom like world of horrors and intense cruelty and
profanity']{.mark}]{.underline} (Mbembé 2003 : 21). In British Caribbean
slave societies, the [space between fi tness and death constituted the
majority of one's life in enslavement]{.underline}. [Legally sanctioned
punishments were the most distinctive form of impairment and disfi
gurement endured by the enslaved.]{.underline} Throughout the colonial
period, the laws that governed the enslaved were written by the white
planter elite and thus refl ected an'immediate reaction of what the
slave-owner conceived to be the necessities of the slave system' (Goveia
1970 : 19).

The 1661 Barbados slave code was the fi rst comprehensive slave law of
the Americas and greatly infl uenced the establishment of other English
colonial laws, including Jamaica's 1664 An Act for the better ordering
and Governing of Negro Slaves. [These early laws granted slave owners
almost unlimited power to punish the enslaved privately and at their own
discretion. Although subsequent laws did not explicitly delegate such
sovereignty, these founding laws established a mentality that it was the
owner's right to govern and punish his or her property, however he or
she saw fi t (]{.underline}Paton 2001 : 927). [In 1717 it was made
illegal for masters to dismember captives on their own property, yet,
'such provisions were by no means ubiquitous', and very little measure
was taken to limit the power of owners to damage their human
property]{.underline} (Goveia 1970 : 29). The enslaved were frequently
sentenced by the courts to have their ears cut off close to their heads,
to have a foot removed and to have their nostrils slit for crimes such
as theft and running away (Paton 2001 : 937--941). In addition to brutal
punishments, [the enslaved also experienced impairment caused by labour
accidents, disease and malnutrition. Unsanitary water and extremely
tight living quarters caused and helped spread a variety of illnesses
and diseases including scabies, leprosy, yaws, parasites and worms,
smallpox, diphtheria, whooping cough, measles, mumps and infl
uenza.]{.underline} One 18th-century plantation management guide
cautioned planters to the kinds of illness to which the enslaved were
prone. The author described the yaws as : great ulcers that break out in
various parts of the body, but chiefl y on the arms, and hips; the
wounds yield very little matter, nor are they very painfull \[sic\]; but
if not cured in time will spread in hard knots all over the body, and
infect the whole mass of blood; the mussels will be contracted and the
features deformed; the face swell'd with large blotches, and death the
consequence---unless skillfull application be had. When any negroe is
soon to have this disorder, he must be taken from amongst your other
slaves, or he will infect the whole . (Dovaston 1774 : 253) Other
illnesses included worms, which caused an individual to appear 'as tho
he was mad, and run about with desperate and ghastly looks, at other
times the slaves will be taken with shakes and fi tts like those of an
ague, and the blood be quite chill'd to their thinking' (Dovaston 1774 :
256).

[[These diseases of unfreedom were an everyday reality for enslaved
individuals and constituted a silent but powerful and highly visible
debilitation of the body]{.mark}. Sugar production was an extremely
dangerous enterprise that caused frequent dismemberment among sugar
boilers and, for fi eld labourers, a gradual deterioration of the
body.]{.underline} Due to their status as chattel, planters utilized
enslaved bodies to their utmost benefi t regardless of impairments. In
the Newton plantation accounts of Christ Church Barbados, Sampson Wood,
manager of the plantation, in 1796 proudly asserted that 'all who can be
of any service in the plantation are put to some occupation or other'
(Newton Papers MS523/288). According to Wood, the mere presence of
severely ill or impaired captives on the plantation, however, was a
problem. [[Wood commented that on the Newton plantation : All have
something to do, except diseased people and cripples, or those who have
a kind of right to be idle, as it were, by prescription & long]{.mark}
(I must say bad) [habit]{.mark}, for it is an ill example to the other
people on the estate & indeed a hardship for whilst they are labouring,
those are at their ... leisure, & have the same daily food, cloathing,
and allowed them & more than the labourers]{.underline}. I wish they
would take themselves off to a distance, as Becky did, I am sure I
should not hinder them. [Wood's complaint that the presence of impaired
and diseased captives on plantation grounds caused contempt among the
able-bodied can be interpreted as a projection of his own aversion to
impaired bondspeople.]{.underline} Due to the limitations of the
archival record, it is diffi cult to ascertain how captives themselves
understood impairment among the enslaved population[. The History of
Mary Prince (\[1831\], in Salih 2000 ) provides an indication, albeit
limited, of how free whites and enslaved blacks responded to the
impaired bodies in their midst.]{.underline} Prince described an
enslaved man named Daniel, who was 'lame in the hip, and could not keep
up with the rest of the slaves' and, thus, subjected to his master's
sadistic punishments, which further incapacitated him. 'He was an object
of pity and terror to the whole gang of slaves', Prince wrote, 'and in
his wretched case we saw, each of us, our own lot, if we should live to
be so old' (Salih 2000 : 21[). Prince suggested that the [enslaved
viewed such physical conditions as a direct result of enslavement, not
as a personal tragedy but, rather, a condition to which they were all
susceptible as forced labourers. She later testifi ed that individuals
whose bodies had no value for the industrial work regime of plantation
labour suffered greater violence at the hands of overseers and owners
than their able-bodied counterparts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Sarah, an
enslaved woman 'nearly past work ... who was subject to several bodily
infirmities, and was not quite right in the head', endured sadistic
punishments from her overseer, Master Dickey, because she 'did not wheel
the barrow fast enough to please him' (Salih 2000 : 22). Sarah died a
few days after she received her punishment. [Prince's narrative
[demonstrates the unremitting violence the enslaved endured and suggests
that individuals whose bodies had become antithetical to the industrial
work regime of plantation labour suffered greater violence at the hands
of overseers and owners than able-bodied labourers
.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Evidence of Things Unseen: Following Slavery's Ghost According to
Gordon, '[The presence of the ghost informs us that the over and done
with "extremity" of a domestic and international slavery has not
entirely gone away, even if it seems to have passed into the register of
history and symbol']{.underline} ( 2008 : 168). [**[Disability is key to
how slavery and the unfi nished work of emancipation continue to haunt
former slave societies]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [The prevalence of
disability caused by poor nutrition and inadequate access to health care
is one key manifestation of slavery's ghost. The rate of diabetes in the
Caribbean islands is consistently high and imposes a very high economic
burden on Caribbean citizens.]{.underline} Many people with diabetes
have limited access to health care, which can lead to temporary and
permanent impairments (Barceló et al. 2003 : 19; International Diabetes
Federation 2013 ). [Rates of incarceration among people of African
descent and people with disabilities are another sign that slavery's
unquiet ghost haunts the African diaspora.]{.underline} [Although the
[majority of research on incarceration, race and disability focuses on
the USA,]{.mark} [such research has relevance to and across the African
diaspora, including the Caribbean]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
**[The]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**[institutionalisation of black impaired
bodies in the Caribbean is inextricably bound to histories of
slavery]{.underline}**.]{.mark} By the late 18th century, laws were put
in force in Barbados and Jamaica to ensure that owners, and not the
state, had the responsibility to provide for their disabled labourers
and keep them from 'wandering' the island ( The Acts of assembly of the
island of Jamaica 1788 : 5). [Prisons and workhouses in the Caribbean
were a relatively new phenomenon in the late 18th century and refl ected
the modern continuum between state penal power and slave- owner
sovereignty]{.underline}. The lodging of disabled captives in workhouses
testifi es to the growing problem of public displays of impaired bodies
in the islands. Today capitalism has found alternative ways to generate
profi t from bodies perceived as disabled by incarcerating them in total
institutions such as nursing homes and prisons. Liat Ben-Moshe explains
that 'disablement has become big business ... \[f\]rom the point of view
of the institution-industrial complex, disabled people are worth more to
the gross domestic product when occupying institutional "beds" than they
are in their own homes' ( 2011 : 393). Race also plays a key role in
rates of institutionalisation in former slave societies. Research on the
USA has shown that in 2006, Latinos and African-Americans were
incarcerated at a rate of 1038 per 100,000 residents and 2468 per
100,000 residents, respectively, compared to whites, who were imprisoned
at a rate of 409 per 100,000 residents. What is more, nearly a quarter
of prison and jail inmates who had a mental health problem had served
three or more prior incarcerations (Ben-Moshe 2011 : 387). '[The [black
body']{.mark}, argues Hershini Bhana Young ( 2005 : 389), '[continues to
be the site onto which the state displaces its own violent crimes,
externalizing its culpability and binding the black body']{.mark}. Thus,
the development of modern notions of disability and race that Atlantic
slavery and the slave trade set in motion can be seen today in the
**[widespread institutionalisation of black and disabled bod
ies]{.mark}.** People of African descent and people with disabilities
are still being constrained by the prejudiced and racist societal forces
of capitalism today. In prisons across the Americas, a racialised and
disabled workforce labours for capitalistic means yet under different
structural forms of violence. Individuals labelled as 'mad', 'foolish'
or 'idiots' as well as people of African descent have long been
associated with notions of social danger and perceived as being prone to
violent crimes (Hahn- Rafter 1997 ; Young 2005 ). Like the structures of
slavery, the incarceration and institutionalisation of black and

Abstraction and fairness Despite our formal knowledge of the sources of
algorithmic bias, **[[it can be difficult to]{.underline}]{.mark}**
identify or **[[take legal measures to combat]{.underline}]{.mark}** it
since the ways that machine learning AI analyze inputs are hidden in a
black
box[Footnote4](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#Fn4)
(Sánchez-Monedero et al.,
[2020](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR84)).
The black box often frustrates efforts to correct inaccurate models, as
it can be unclear if an AI system granted undue weight to non-causal
factors or correctly identified a pattern we have yet to grasp. While
seeking explanations may illuminate broad strokes of their processing,
these algorithms' inferences might simply be too complex for humans to
make sense of (Selbst & Barocas,
[2018](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR88)).
This inscrutability raises the broader question of whether we should
turn to AI for inferences about deeply normative, difficult-to-quantify
**[[issues such as built inaccessibility and disability
status.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In the face of concerns about differing
notions of bias, legal uncertainty, and the black box, vendors
operationalized demands that AI delivers fair outcomes for protected
classes. These fair-ML methods seek to translate bias into easily
quantifiable terms that algorithms can understand such as error rates
(Agrawal,
[2019](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR1)).
For instance, **[[by defining fairness]{.underline}]{.mark}** as a
mathematical constraint **[[and optimizing]{.mark} for
[it]{.mark}]{.underline}** or modifying training data **[[until outputs
conform to fairness]{.mark}]{.underline}** standards, fair-ML can help
mitigate disparities stemming from technical errors such as flawed
input--output relations or training data. While fairness is
operationalized in countless ways, most fall into one of three
approaches (Corbett-Davies & Goel,
[2018](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR25)).[Footnote5](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#Fn5)
First, anti-classification, also called fairness through unawareness,
omits data about membership in protected classes as well as any traits
associated with them (Zafar et al.,
[2017](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR106)).
For instance, **[[one]{.underline}]{.mark}** might design an AI that
explicitly **[[cannot access]{.underline}]{.mark}** information about
applicants' **[[disability status.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Second,
calibration holds that people who an AI scores similarly ought to end up
having similar outcomes (Dieterich et al.,
[2016](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR30)).
For example, imagine an AI that equalizes false omission rates and
negative predictive values so applicants with similar scores are equally
likely to become poor employees, whether they are disabled or not.
Third, classification parity defines fairness as a matter of equalizing
a predictive measure across groups (Chouldechova et al.,
[2018](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR22)).
For example, an AI might equalize error rates such that applicants who
end up succeeding are equally likely to be selected, independent of
disability status. Fair-ML's **[[understanding of fairness
reflects]{.underline}]{.mark}** neither
**[[procedural]{.underline}]{.mark}** nor **[[normative concepts of the
term]{.underline}]{.mark}** but instead is a formal, mathematical
criteria that AI outputs should not stray from (Ochigame,
[2019a](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR72))[.]{.mark}
On this view, algorithms are biased if they violate a certain standard,
the satisfaction of which is taken to indicate fairness (Mulligan et
al.,
[2019](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR67)).
While **[[conforming to these standards]{.underline}]{.mark}** often is
valuable, doing so **[[ought not be taken as sufficient for securing
fairness in the normative sense.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Instead, fair-ML
methods are best understood as pragmatic ways to render bias tractable
despite the black box by replacing messy legal and normative issues with
formal rules (Bennett et al.,
[2020](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR9);
Green & Viljoen,
[2020](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR43)).
As such, these methods can be effective at addressing mathematical
errors, such as inaccurate training datasets and input--output
relations. Yet, while fair-ML can reduce certain outcome disparities, it
lacks a principled way of detecting bias. The gap between formal and
normative concepts of fairness was brought to light when researchers at
ProPublica reported that COMPAS, an algorithm which predicted recidivism
risk, discriminated against black defendants (Angwin et al.,
[2016](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR5)).
Specifically, it had lower false negative and higher false positive
rates for black defendants than for white ones, which violated
classification parity. COMPAS' developers, Northpointe (now Equivant),
replied by arguing that error rates are flawed measures of fairness and
noting that COMPAS exhibited equal predictive values for black and white
defendants, thus ensuring calibration (Dieterich et al.,
[2016](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR30)).
In this dispute, **[[whether]{.mark} [COMPAS was racially biased
seemingly hinged neither on legal procedure nor normative
principle]{.mark}]{.underline}** but on various fair-ML criteria. While
anti-classification, calibration, and classification parity all aim to
operationalize distinct notions of fairness, it is mathematically
impossible to satisfy each of these definitions simultaneously in the
real world (Jacobs & Wallach,
[2021](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR52)).
Research has found that these standards could be reconciled only if the
recidivism rate were uniform across groups, the AI was entirely
accurate, or some groups never faced negative outcomes (Barocas et al.,
[2018](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR6);
Chouldechova,
[2017](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR21)).
Similarly, in the context of hiring, if disabled people performed worse
than average on a given pre-employment assessment, calibrating
employability predictions would shoulder them with higher false negative
and lower false positive rates. This suggests that **[[algorithms
inevitably are unfair]{.underline}]{.mark}** in that they will violate
at least one fair-ML approach and reflects the conceptual tensions
between the **[[normative notions of fairness]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that **[[underpin]{.mark} [each]{.mark}]{.underline}** of these
**[[approach]{.underline}]{.mark}**es[.]{.mark}[Footnote6](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#Fn6)
Although fair-ML treats bias as the product of inaccurate input--output
relations and training data, **[[decisions about how to reduce bias are
normative issues, not technical ones.]{.mark} [Choices about which kind
of algorithmic fairness to
implement]{.mark}]{.underline}**---anti-classification, calibration,
classification parity, and so on---**[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}**
intrinsically **[[value-laden because they shape what AI designers
consider to be a biased outcome.]{.underline}]{.mark}** As such, it is
unclear how to assess competing fair-ML strategies without appealing to
normative reasons. For instance, since letting some criminals go is
preferable to punishing innocents, data scientists predicting recidivism
risk should be more concerned with false positives than false negatives.
Yet, equalizing false negatives seems more important for AI hiring
because approved candidates still face additional interviews while those
screened out have little redress. At the same time, post-hoc measures
for uncovering false negatives in hiring tests, such as approving a
random set of lower-ranked applicants, would be much more difficult to
justify in the context of recidivism. **[[Narrow focus on
abstract]{.mark} [proxies for equality denies]{.mark}]{.underline}** one
[**[the information required to evaluate the merits of different
fairness standards. To define fairness as a formal constraint divorced
from normative commitments and social context]{.underline}**]{.mark} is
to commit a category error. The difficulty of using solely technical
means to secure normative ends points to broader issues with fair-ML,
**[[raising questions about how we should understand disability and
fairness in]{.mark}]{.underline}** light of **[[structural
ableism.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Algorithmic ableism To optimize for fairness and make data portable
despite **[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** black box, disability status
often is modelled as a one-dimensional variable. This **[[tendency to
abstract away environmental and social context artificially limits
categories of disability and obscures the process of measuring
it.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In doing so, **[[AI
design]{.underline}]{.mark}** unintentionally can
**[[reinforce]{.underline}]{.mark}** both [**[the form
and]{.underline}** **[content of]{.underline}**]{.mark} the medical
model **[[of disability.]{.mark} [By omitting the value-laden decisions
involved in operationalizing disability]{.mark},]{.underline}** fair-ML
flattens variations in the intensities and kinds of people's
disabilities and further marginalizes those at the intersections.
**[[Analyzing]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[normative]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[commitments]{.underline}]{.mark}** of this approach highlights the
importance of **[[considering]{.underline}]{.mark}** a wider array of
[**[ethical]{.underline}** **[concerns]{.underline}**]{.mark} beyond
training data and input--output relations. When data scientists tackle
open-ended goals such as diversity in hiring, they must translate
**[[contest]{.underline}]{.mark}**ed **[[models of
disability]{.underline}]{.mark}** into a single target that can be
measured and adjusted in the black box (Selbst et al.,
[2019](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR87)).
As such, bias mitigation requires rendering concepts like protected
class status amenable to quantification so discrete weights can be
ascribed to them. For example, Pymetrics adjusts its AI to satisfy the
4/5ths rule by assessing if scores differ based on neatly defined
categories of gender, race, and age (Yoo,
[2017](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR105)).
HireVue, which uses natural language processing to analyze the content
of applicants' speech during automated interviews and gamified tasks,
makes similar claims (Zuloaga,
[2021](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR107)).
As part of this process, HireVue explicitly designs their questions in
order to elicit readily quantifiable responses (Larsen,
[2019](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR58)).
**[[AI vendors]{.mark} often [idealize abstraction
since]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[removing context-specific
data]{.underline}**]{.mark} can **[[help algorithms function more
accurately]{.underline}]{.mark}** across a variety of settings (Selbst
et al.,
[2019](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR87))[.]{.mark}
However, **[[accuracy is hampered by the fact that most data about
disabled people are not comprehensive, without comparability, and low
quality]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Altman & Rasch,
[2016](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR2);
Maritz et al.,
[2017](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR63)).
As a result, gathering more disability data and designing a shared
system for classifying it plays an important role in bias reduction.
Since optimizing for fairness can reduce accuracy, collecting
high-quality disability data could help mitigate bias stemming from
unrepresentative datasets (Chen et al.,
[2018](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR20)).
While better representation in training data is necessary to secure just
outcomes, disclosing **[[one's disability status
can]{.underline}]{.mark}** lead to data misuse and [**[expose one to
further
discrimination]{.underline}**.]{.mark}[Footnote7](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#Fn7)
However, even if people could provide information about their
disabilities without fear of repercussion, what it means to identify as
disabled is not always straightforward. It is not simply that some
disabled people are understandably reluctant to disclose, but that if
and how they identify depends on the model of disability and type of
measurement at hand. Researchers have found that how people define their
disabilities---if they identify as disabled at all---is predicted by a
wide array of factors, such as the type of inquiry (Brown & Broido,
[2020](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR15)),
intensity and stigma (Bogart et al.,
[2017](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR12)),
and environmental context (Santuzzi & Waltz,
[2016](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR85)).
A host of other factors, such access to an official diagnosis,
internalized self-doubt, and whether one's disability is (in)visible
also plausibly affect self-identification. Other studies suggest that
whether and how one identifies impacts the types of bias encountered
(Nario-Redmond et al.,
[2019](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR68)),
methods used to navigate them (Nario-Redmond et al.,
[2013](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR69)),
and levels of self-esteem (Bogart,
[2014](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR11)).
These **[[different understandings of disability]{.underline}]{.mark}**
not only call for distinct types of measurement but also **[[are
correlated with distinct outcomes.]{.mark}]{.underline}** For example,
official medical diagnoses seem to be good predictors of access to
health care while self-identification likely is a better proxy for group
and political affiliation. Data scientists cannot operationalize
disability status as a single, binary variable because the category's
nature and boundaries are not self-evident even among people who seem to
fit within it. While definitions of disability are fiercely contested,
**[[the ways in which disability data are collected and become legible
to AI lend disproportionate weight to the medical model of
disability.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Given that disclosing disability
status can open one up to further discrimination, disability is often
quantified only when the situation demands proof of it, e.g., to make an
insurance claim, secure a diagnosis, or receive treatment. Aspects of
other models of disability, such as social attitudes and built
environment, are difficult to measure and, when people have a chance to
self-report, they typically are limited to the binary categories of
census and actuarial forms. As a result, data scientists seeking to make
use of what little disability data exists often turn to information
gathered and stored in a narrow range of contexts and formats. In turn,
**[[the processes of selecting proxies, generating labels, and curating
datasets tend to translate disability into
concepts]{.mark}]{.underline}** amenable **[[to the medical
model.]{.underline}]{.mark}** That is, **[[algorithms end up assessing
disabled people through a lens that defines disability as a biological
dysfunction isolated from structural ableism.]{.mark} [Abstraction
deprives AI designers of the information required to operationalize
disability status as anything but a biomedical dysfunction.]{.mark} [One
need not deny disability's material aspects to recognize that adopting
an entirely medical understanding of disability crowds out analysis of
the socio-political processes that inform
it]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} After all, that **[[disability
becomes legible to AI in terms of measurable diagnoses does not entail
that AI is objective but highlights its alignment with the medical
model.]{.mark}]{.underline}** For example, if disabled people score
lower on a given pre-employment **[[test]{.mark}, [to]{.mark}
[operationalize disability without accounting for]{.mark}]{.underline}**
the **[[ableist structures]{.underline}]{.mark}** at the root of that
performance gap cannot help but **[[attribute that gap to bodily
failures.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Similarly, **[[once social context is
omitted]{.mark},]{.underline}** one can no longer appeal to hiring bias
to explain why irregular eye contact adversely impacts employability,
shouldering disabled applicants with that responsibility instead.
Because disability cannot be reduced to biological facts,
**[[abstracting away information about one's built environment and
social context is inaccurate and renders structural ableism
benign.]{.underline}]{.mark}** However, efforts to remove context from
or quantify aspects of disability sheds light on the value-laden nature
of ostensibly objective AI design. After all, **[[the notion that one's
competence can be understood apart from]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[setting]{.underline}]{.mark}** it occurs in **[[is hardly a neutral
one.]{.underline}]{.mark}** For instance, some researchers studying
performance assessments argue competence can only be assessed in situ
since it is intrinsically contextual and shifts in response to dynamic,
complex workplace environments (Cate & Regehr,
[2019](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR18);
Govaerts & van der Vleuten,
[2013](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR41)).
To focus solely on quantitative aspects of performance risks omitting
information regarding, e.g., interactions between chronic fatigue and
irregular work schedules, or moldy buildings and asthma flare ups. That
**[[such factors]{.underline}]{.mark}** are often **[[removed from AI
models]{.underline}]{.mark}** while more quantifiable traits **[[are
treated as]{.mark}]{.underline}** legitimate markers of 'fit' is [**[not
objective but shaped by ableist
norms]{.underline}**.]{.mark}[Footnote8](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#Fn8)
For example, while studies show that disabled people perform similarly
on many aspects of employability (Houtenville & Kalargyrou,
[2015](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR49);
Lindsay et al.,
[2018](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR60)),
automated interviews often place great stock in easily measured factors
such as a measured tone and eye contact (Whittaker et al.,
[2019](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR104)).
As such, assessing applicants primarily in terms of abstract,
quantitative factors does not preserve objectivity so much as obscure
the underlying assumptions of **[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}** designers.
By evaluating hiring outcomes for disabled people based on factors that
do not resist quantification, fair-ML omits more nebulous aspects of
disability and **[[makes it difficult to identify the ways in which
structural ableism shapes data.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Consider that
while sentencing decisions hinge on many factors, recidivism risk has
been measured disproportionately. Researchers have noted that this focus
disposes algorithms such as COMPAS to assess sentences in ways that
prioritize incapacitation over, e.g., retribution and rehabilitation
(Green,
[2018](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR42);
Selbst et al.,
[2019](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR87)).
Similarly, imagine a hiring algorithm that predicts employability based
entirely on quantifiable traits, like employment gaps, requests for
medical leave, or expected cost of reasonable accommodations. Even if
designers omitted explicit references to disability, such an AI would
subtly emphasize correlations to disability status without providing
important context or explanation. By **[[prioritizing quantifiable
aspects of disability]{.underline}]{.mark}** over those not so easily
measured, fair-ML configures and **[[restricts our understanding of and
responses to algorithmic bias.]{.underline}]{.mark}** While inclusive
data collection practices might better capture the contexts disabled
people navigate, they would struggle to assign static values to them due
to disability's dynamic and shifting nature. Given that AI designers
assign and modify discrete weights to features in their models,
algorithms evaluate populations in terms of several snapshots taken at
certain times instead of gradually emerging outcomes, they can end up
entrenching injustice. For example, hiring AI that select applicants
based on similarity to previous employees may not adapt to increases in
workplace diversity, thus perpetuating bias. Moreover, since
disabilities such as chronic pain, asthma, depression, and so on tend to
wax and wane day-by-day or over one's life, modelling people's
capacities in terms of a single binary dimension imposes artificial
fixity.[Footnote9](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#Fn9)
One's performance on a pre-employment assessment cannot be understood in
isolation from whether, to give an example, their chronic pain is
flaring up that week. **[It is not just that experiences of disability
are inseparable from their contexts, but that [disabilities are embodied
in shifting ways that cannot be captured by one
variable.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Although two people might receive
diagnoses for the same disability, how they experience that disability
and the degree to which it impacts their lives might vary immensely.
**[[By removing context and assigning discrete values to disability
status, algorithms flatten differences between and within disabled
people.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The difficulty of operationalizing
disability in AI raises similar concerns about membership in other
protected classes, many of which also are modelled as binary variables
to facilitate de-biasing. Although the sheer multitude of disabilities
and historical shifts in their boundaries shed light on the category's
instability, **[[disability is deeply entangled with other aspects of
identity]{.mark}. [Race]{.mark}]{.underline}**, gender, class, and so on
**[[intersect and overlap with disability in ways that generate distinct
forms of structural discrimination that cannot be reduced to their
component parts]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Crenshaw,
[1991](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR27))[.]{.mark}
Crucially, intersectionality does not entail that disability is neatly
analogous with other identities but that the institutions, structures,
and norms shaping them are co-constitutive and mutually reinforcing
(Erevelles,
[2018](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR32)).
Given that fair-ML **[[optimize]{.underline}]{.mark}**s **[[for
fairness]{.underline}]{.mark}** with respect to protected attributes in
isolation, it **[[artificially separates intertwined aspects of
identity]{.mark}, [which disproportionately impacts those at their
intersections]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} For example, research has
found that facial recognition algorithms exhibit higher error rates when
classifying the faces of darker-skinned women than could be explained by
either race or gender alone (Buolamwini & Gebru,
[2018](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR16)).
Initiatives promoting more inclusive datasets and fair outcomes must
reckon with the fact that classifications and the authority to shape
them are mediated by discriminatory structures. Indeed, whether one
receives legal recognition as disabled is impacted by intersections with
these structures, as multiply marginalized disabled people may struggle
to secure access to the category itself. For example, given the price of
healthcare, the ability to obtain a diagnosis from the medical
institutions that AI researchers often collect data from is unevenly
distributed. Similarly, certification of disability status is mediated
by other biases, such as many physicians' undue skepticism about women's
experiences of chronic pain (Mingus,
[2017](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR64))
and the false belief that black people have an unusually high pain

[2018](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR32)).
Given that intersecting axes of oppression impact one's ability to claim
disability status, the few disabled people officially recognized as such
in training datasets seem likely to be disproportionately wealthy,
white, and male. Data scientists cannot merely tack disability on to a
list of isolated protected classes since their intersections affect who
'counts' as disabled. Instead, **[[they should attend to the ways in
which subjective decisions and structural hierarchies impact AI design,
situating experiences of disability in their
context.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### 2AC \-\-- Tech Good

#### Modern technology is unpredictable; we cannot rely on it to "solve" disability

**Schalk 18** (Sami Schalk, Associate Professor in the Department of
Gender & Women\'s Studies at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison,
(2018) *Bodyminds Reimagined: (Dis)ability, Race, and Gender in Black
Women\'s Speculative Fiction* 105-108
http://library.lol/main/2C8F7A1D8C5F5DC42089719EDD904C24)

Through the origins of hyperempathy, Butler demonstrates how [[modern
technology can have unpredictable effects]{.mark}, particularly
technologies applied to human bodyminds. Such a speculative fictional
representation is not far from impossible given the incredible rate of
prescription drug consumption in contemporary American culture and our
increasing interest in genetic testing, selection, and manipulation of
embryos. [The representation of hyperempathy suggests]{.mark}, in its
critical dystopian form, [that we cannot know in advance what our
widespread cultural use of pharmaceutical treatments, genetic
alterations, and other disability-preventing/curing technologies might
have on our bodyminds in the long run]{.mark}, let alone on the
bodyminds of future generations.]{.underline} Butler's papers reveal
that she planned to extend this theme in the unfinished third book in
the series, often referred to as Parable of the Trickster. Drafts,
notes, and outlines for this text show Butler was exploring the idea of
having an Earthseed community travel to start a new colony on a planet
in another solar system. When the community members arrive, people begin
to experience different forms of disablement, which vary from draft to
draft, including blindness, epilepsy, paralysis, and hallucinations. The
idea that she continued to experiment with, based on these 106 Chapter
Three drafts, outlines, and notes, was that either the technology used
to keep the Earthseed community members alive on the trip, or the toxins
in the air of the new habitable planet, caused these changes, and the
community must learn to live with their altered bodyminds.12 Butler's
engagement with the effects of technology in the future is not simply
limited to (dis)ability, but also has important material intersections
with issues of race, gender, and class. When imagining a disability-free
future perpetuated by technological advances that will supposedly
prevent congenital disability and "fix" or "cure" all acquired
disabilities, it is important to ask, who will have access to these
advanced medical technologies and who will not? On whose bodyminds will
new and experimental drugs and devices be tested? Who will perform the
labor to extract raw materials for and construct these new technologies?
Who will benefit the most and who will be barred from participation?
[[If the history of medical]{.mark} experimentation such as the Tuskegee
experiments or the work of Dr. Marion Sims [tells us anything, people of
color, women, working-class people, and people in poverty will benefit
the least from technological advances and will be most at risk for harm
in the development, production, and consumption of new
technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}13 In the Parable series,
Butler emphasizes that technology is neither inherently liberatory nor
destructive. In a journal entry dated April 23, 1999, Butler writes
about this directly, stating, "Technology isn't good or bad. It's part
of who we are, part of what we do. It's how we us\[e\] it is \[w\]hat
matters, of course" (Octavia E. Butler Papers, "oeb 1069"). [[Technology
does not have inherent value; rather, it is how we as a culture use,
misuse, and make available technologies that produces technological
enhancements and/or harm]{.mark}. Further, [the line between enhancement
and harm is not always clear---nor are the two mutually
exclusive.]{.mark}]{.underline} Enhancement for whom and harm to whom?
What kind of enhancement and how much? What kind of harm and how much?
As Butler writes, ["[Consequences may be beneficial or harmful]{.mark}.
They may be too slight to matter or they may be worth the risk because
the potential benefits are great, but the consequences are always
there"]{.underline} ("A Few Rules for Predicting the Future" 166).
Technology, the Parable series asserts in the face of the ideal of a
technologically created, disability-free future, is an ambivalent
cultural tool which is subject to both use and abuse, availability and
unavailability, and a variety of unintended consequences. Hyperempathy
is used as a primary example of this position on technology. As a
result, Butler encourages readers to un- Bodyminds of the Future 107
derstand that one's critical position in relation to technology need not
be either purely celebratory or, in Melzer's words, "paranoid rejection"
("And How Many Souls Do You Have?'" 177). Instead[, [we can evaluate
particular technologies within specific contexts of creation and use. We
can do so in solidarity with people with disabilities, p]{.mark}eople
[o]{.mark}f [c]{.mark}olor[, the working class, the poor, and others who
are more likely to participate in the creation and testing of such
technologies while being less likely to be the beneficiaries of the
results of such developments]{.mark}]{.underline}. Butler's published
and unpublished writings argue [that [technology guarantees neither a
disability-free future nor any other supposedly desired outcome since we
cannot predict its longterm effects,]{.mark} especially when it comes to
biomedical technology]{.underline}. In particular, the Parable series
demonstrates how marginalized groups, [especially people of color and
the poor, are less likely to have access to healing/curing technologies
and are much more likely to be the targets of destructive technologies
of violence and war. The suggestion that we cannot know in advance what
our impulse toward a technologically created, [disability-free future
might lead to may seem problematically foreboding because it potentially
suggests that the problem of disability-prevention technologies is that
they might simply create more disability]{.mark}.]{.underline} However,
the second way that the representation of hyperempathy resists our
cultural idealization of a technologically created, disabilityfree
future is through the representation of disability-related pleasure.
Butler's creation of hyperempathy insists on pleasure as an inherent
aspect of the experience of this disability, a type of pleasure that
nonsharers can never experience. For example, Lauren states that when
having sex, "I get the guy's good feeling and my own" (Parable of the
Sower 12). During her early travels with her friends Harry and Zahra,
Lauren also shares their pleasure when they have sex near her during
their watch, writing, "I got caught up in their lovemaking. I couldn't
escape their sensation" (200). Later, when she meets Bankole, Lauren
again discusses sharing pleasure in sex, explaining, "Best of all, he
took a lot of uncomplicated pleasure in my body, and I got to share it
with him. It isn't often that I can enjoy the good side of my
hyperempathy. I let the sensation take over, intense and wild" (266).
While these moments of Lauren's shared pleasure are few in comparison to
the many representations of shared pain, they are incredibly important
to Butler's representation of disability in the future. The
representation of disability-related pleasure in the Parable series
shifts the ableist ways in which our culture typically understands
disabled bodyminds as both nonsexual and as always more difficult and
limiting than nondisabled bodyminds. Importantly, Butler does this
without making Lauren come across as magical or as the perpetually
overcoming, superpowered supercrip.14

Further, [[deconstructing differences will not]{.mark} in and of itself
[produce respect and equality between all people with various
characteristics. Neither will it result in a social order free from a
sense of difference.]{.mark} It is simply unrealistic to assume that a
society could exist were people would not see some other people as
different]{.underline}, and their lives or characteristics as
representing a deviation from some norm considered important regarding
good human life. This is because [[some]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
[[individual characteristics]{.underline}]{.mark} that define disabled
people [[are, sometimes]{.underline}]{.mark} with good reason,
[[undesirable, even in a utopia]{.mark} where all differences would have
been queered.]{.underline} [**[Disability is not the same]{.mark}**
as]{.underline} many [other group identities]{.underline} and we need to
explore both morally and socially disability and difference rather than
simply use difference as a concept through which to critique the
disability identity. [There are no rational reasons to consider
homosexuality or gender undesirable characteristics whatever the social
context,]{.underline} but there are many impairments that can reasonably
be seen as undesirable (Shakespeare 2006). [[Motor neuron disease,
depression or spinal cord injury are]{.underline}]{.mark} the kinds of
[[conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[we would prefer not to]{.mark}

[impairments]{.mark} can include an undesirable dimension **[does not
imply devaluing people with impairments]{.mark}** nor their positive
group identity]{.underline} (Shakespeare and Watson 2010). As long as
people are genuinely free to decide for themselves and feel about
themselves however they wish to feel, we are pretty close to relational
justice, free from hierarchical evils. [Imposing on people ableist or
disablist assumptions is certainly wrong, but so would be the denial of
the personal experiences]{.underline} of fearing the loss of one's
physical and mental capacities, or the fear of dying (Carel 2008). [To

What [I am]{.underline} also [unwilling to take]{.underline} with [the
theory of assemblage]{.underline} is the freighted territory [of the
cyborg:]{.underline} [the feminist materialist theory of becoming
developed by Donna Haraway that combines human, animal, and machine as a
radical political enterprise that ushers in the future both
theoretically and practically]{.underline}. I have found it useful as a
thought exercise that complicates the relationship of the body to itself
and to others and deals with our very real reliance on machines and
kinship with animals. Since the cyborg opens up the conversation about
futurity---which usually elides madness and Blackness---it also becomes
a useful space to consider who we are becoming.60 Certainly, to think
through our kinship with machines is apropos for discussions of
disability given the medicalization of certain bodies, and remains so
given my emphasis on speculative fiction. But [the cyborg is an
incomplete, politically fraught, and ethically suspicious answer to a
series of questions about raced and disabled futurity.]{.underline}
[Material reality must reckon with]{.underline} what others have pointed
out are the [lived experiences of the Black and disabled
body]{.underline}, what amount to (in this project, at least) the gaps
and folds within Black speculative fiction. Read in alignment with Tobin
Siebers's theory of complex embodiment and Alison Kafer's questioning of
spatial, cultural, and temporal logics, the [emphasis on the cyborg and
the desire to supersede the body has an antagonistic relationship with
concerns at the heart of disability studies: pain, fiscal access, and
the validity of embodied experience]{.underline}, to name a few.61 [What
happens when one does not desire cyborgian intervention as
cure?]{.underline} [What of those for whom material cyborgian realities
are more painful than useful or pleasurable? As much as cyborgian
futures promise a radical set of possibilities for considering
disability,]{.underline} [we ought to be wary]{.underline} of them
[because they are also reliant on a set of middleclass]{.underline} (or
rich) [realities]{.underline}. I have elsewhere pointed out the way [the
cyborg's promise of radical potential hinges on an original white
Western subject]{.underline}.62 Leaning on Donna Haraway's original
definition, [João Costa Vargas and Joy A. James understand the Black
cyborg as a postbellum construction that requires Black
degradation]{.underline}: "A Black cyborg: a modified, improved human
whose increased ethical, spiritual, and physical capabilities generate
unusual strength, omniscience, and boundless love."63 [They invoke
Haraway's understanding of the cyborg as]{.underline} both [real and
fictive to pinpoint how the Black cyborg relies on a set of interracial
dynamics that extend from a history steeped in anti-Blackness. The Black
cyborg is required to participate in its own self abnegation since it is
built on top of the foundations of American democratic and imperial
projects reliant on phobic understandings of Blackness]{.underline}. The
[Black cyborg, then, in Vargas and James's formulation, echoes that of
the disabled cyborg: neither can escape the desire for normalcy that
erases Blackness and madness both.]{.underline} Alison Kafer reads in
the gaps of Haraway's work and its intellectual genealogy to reinsert
the oft-overlooked contributions of women of color---among them Octavia
E. Butler and Chela Sandoval---to the definition of the cyborg. She
pinpoints that the [cyborg as transgressive figure has limited
potential]{.underline} precisely [because of how it has
been]{.underline} developed and [mobilized in ways that erase women of
color and reify the virgule between disabled and
able-bodied.]{.underline} Though the cyborg asks for blasphemous
interpretation---a promise and proposition Kafer, Vargas, and James
readily champion---as part of its political transgression, I question
how much the cyborg can map a future of any kind when it relies on a
past and path of erasure. What [the cyborg ushers in]{.underline}---that
I'd prefer to leave aside for this discussion---is [an assemblage yoked
to anti-Blackness and ableism, a]{.underline} method of becoming that
requires theoretical overcoming [since the theories rely on but refuse
disabled and Black embodiment.]{.underline}

#### The Aff is an ableist cyborg hoax

**Ellcessor 16** (Elizabeth Ellcessor is an associate professor of media
studies at the University of Virginia, "Cyborg hoaxes: Disability,

**[[Cyborg hoaxes, deceptive forms of identity presentation that
articulate gender, disability, and technology, have been
persistent]{.mark}]{.underline}** but unremarked upon elements of online
culture. By identifying, contextualizing, and deconstructing them, this
article has highlighted the persistence of an ideology of ability in
online culture and in cyberculture and Internet studies. [An ideology of
ability is at work in the pitiable presentation of a digital sweet
innocent and in the excuses offered by cancer. Identifying these themes
reveals that online cultures remain closely connected to larger
ideologies and norms.]{.underline} Far from offering a "liberation
technology" (Coombs, 1991[**), [online spaces may reproduce and amplify
the prejudices and normative assumptions of a broader cultural context.
These deceptive assemblages deploy disability strategically for an
able-bodied audience,]{.mark} taking advantage of existing hierarchies.
Yet, they may also challenge the very ideologies upon which they
depend**.]{.underline} For instance, the prominence of romance and
sexuality in these hoaxes counters very real tendencies to desexualize
people with disabilities[. **[Such contradictions, and the blurring of
identity and technology, are indicative of the "cyborg" component of
these hoaxes]{.mark}.**]{.underline} While I retained this language in
order to highlight the possibility of such provocations, it is in the
experiences of people with disabilities using online media that a richer
form of cyborg can be found. [These experiences reflect a variety of
possible linkages of gender and sexuality, disability, and technology.
In these formations, people with disabilities can be understood "as
cyborgs not because of \[their\] bodies (e.g. our use of prosthetics,
ventilators, or attendants), but because of \[their\] political
practices"]{.underline} (Kafer, 2013: 120**[). [In claiming disability
identity and engaging in community formation, by reconfiguring default
settings of computer hardware and software, and by speaking back to
dominant narratives of disability and gender, these individuals and
communities are producing disability technocultures that are seditious
and, too often, invisible.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Disability is a
necessary and theoretically rich addition to the forms of identity,
community, and material technology that have dominated critical and
cultural studies of digital media. Present since the earliest
cyberculture work, but rendered invisible or metaphorical, disability
offers important critical resources for the nuanced and complex study of
the digital networked media that increasingly permeate daily life. Not a
metaphor, and not invisible, but ever-present and meaningful, disability
offers a lens through which to examine theoretical assumptions and
exclusions and with which to critically interrogate normative forms of
digital media and the ideological structures that maintain and challenge
them.

### 1NC \-\-- Liberalism 

**Even if political liberalism currently excludes the disabled,
discussing questions of implementation can revise it**

**Badano 13** (Gabriele -- PhD candidate at the Centre for Philosophy,
Justice and Health at University College London -- "Political liberalism
and the justice claims of the disabled: a reconciliation," Critical
Review of International Social and Political Philosophy, April 2013,

I argue that any proposal [[abandoning the language of political justice
would not]{.underline}]{.mark} seem to [[do enough for]{.mark} those
[individuals with disabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} who fall outside the
basic idea of persons as depicted by Rawls. In fact, the intuitions
supporting [the idea that concepts like rights and opportunities are
indispensable are very strong.]{.underline}11 Let us go back to the
examples of individuals falling outside Rawls's idea of persons because
their disabilities prevent them from being a net beneﬁt to social
cooperation. [They are [individuals]{.mark}]{.underline} who need
multiple carers to work, or [[whose disabilities prevent them from
providing a beneﬁt to social cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} that is
large enough. To put the point more sharply, it is worth noticing that
the disabilities in question are compatible with being in full
possession of one's logical and moral powers. Now, **[[should we
accept]{.mark} that [those individuals ought to be given no
rights]{.mark} or opportunities?]{.underline}** An afﬁrmative answer
would strike us as implausible, and for a good reason. In [a liberal
society, having one's rights, opportunities and]{.underline} basic
distributive [entitlements acknowledged is one and the same as being
recognized as an equal.]{.underline} And what is missing from Rawls's
political liberalism is precisely the idea that falling below a
threshold of full cooperation should not be enough to prevent the
disabled from being regarded as persons on an equal footing with anyone
else. In sum, [Rawls's political liberalism is not amenable to any
extension that,]{.underline} keeping the basic ideas of society and
persons intact, [is able to include a concern with the status of
individuals with disabilities.]{.underline} In addition, the proposal
that the interests of the disabled are not for public reason to protect
is not satisfactory. [Consequently, a]{.underline} substantial
**[[revision is the only way to reconcile political liberalism
with]{.underline}]{.mark}** our intuitions concerning **[[what is due to
the disabled]{.mark}.]{.underline}** 5. Revising political liberalism I:
beyond Hartley's contractualism The aim of this section and the next is
to propose a substantial revision of Rawls's theory that accommodates
the justice claims of the disabled while upholding the project of
political liberalism. [A question that needs to be answered]{.underline}
at this point [is: **why should we uphold**]{.underline} the project of
[**political liberalism, rather than endorsing a different model** that
more neatly ﬁts with our]{.underline} intuitions concerning [what is due
to the disabled**?**]{.underline} First, the general project of
[[political liberalism is compelling]{.mark}.]{.underline} Rawls's
political liberalism aims to identify a common ground of political ideas
that can work as the basis on which the most important political
decisions should be made. [This project is of the greatest importance
because]{.underline}, if successful, [[it creates legitimacy by building
institutions on the basis of concepts]{.mark} that are [acceptable to
each]{.mark}]{.underline} reasonable [[individual]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Moreover, it promotes stability in societies that are characterized by
deep pluralism. Second, [[despite Rawls's failure to take]{.mark} the
interests of [the disabled into consideration,]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[political liberalism is well suited to support the justice claims of
individuals with disabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This is because
[the idea that the disabled are citizens who deserve our respect is part
of the common culture]{.underline} of our societies. In other words,
there is an overlapping consensus on the idea that rights, opportunities
and distributive shares must be granted to individuals who are not fully
cooperating members of society, including those who fall below full
moral powers. It is widely believed that [[those with]{.mark} physical
[disabilities should have the same rights as]{.mark} their [fellow
citizens, live in a social environment that does
not]{.mark}]{.underline} excessively [[limit their opportunities and
receive beneﬁts that]{.mark} help [meet their]{.mark}]{.underline}
special [[needs]{.mark}.]{.underline} Besides, although the state or
third parties are given exceptional rights to interfere with the
autonomy of individuals with severe cognitive disabilities, [it is
widely recognized that the mentally disabled are citizens whose basic
interests must be protected by the law.]{.underline}12 In the public
space, any proposal that individuals who are not fully cooperating
members of society should have their basic interests neglected would be
widely received with outrage. Such proposal would be said to ﬁt a
fascist society, not a decent one. Among other legal documents, the
United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN
General Assembly, A/61/611) can be taken as the epitome of this
widespread attitude. Adopted in 2006, the Convention requires that all
individuals with disabilities should share in the enjoyment of equal
fundamental rights.

International Relations (**[[IR]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [is a field of
vision]{.underline}. Elements traditional to IR like nuclear
[deterrence]{.underline}, armed [conflict]{.underline},
[terrorism]{.underline}, or [great power balancing]{.underline}, all
[**[require states to]{.mark}** interpret]{.underline} the
[behavior]{.underline} and posture of other actors [to
**[define]{.mark}**]{.underline} the menu of
**[[options]{.underline}]{.mark}** that are [available]{.underline} to
them. [Ontological security theorists]{.underline} in general
[agree]{.underline} with this position, [arguing]{.underline} that
[feelings and interpretations of]{.underline} their [security are
required for states to understand their position in relation to
others]{.underline} in the international system. Thus, a state's
identity is defined as much by its relationship and feeling of threat
toward and among other states. But **[[what happens if]{.mark} the
linchpin of defining [a state's security is
covert]{.mark}]{.underline}**, what if [the mechanisms by which a state
understands its security standing is accomplished not in the light, but
rather in the shadows, around computer networks, non-state actors,
disinformation campaigns, hacking, and at least for democratic states
like the US through electoral manipulation?]{.underline}

At a recent conference panel with intelligent scholars of various stripe
I was asked 'when was the last cyber attack?' They noted the presence of
Stuxnet (a US-Israeli produced computer virus targeting the Iranian
nuclear refining infrastructure at the Natanz plant) but hinted in
confusion that there had not been much since. And my colleague was not
alone, polling on the threat of cyber-attack routinely finds that these
actions among the lowest of concerns for most Americans,1 The problem
inherent in the disconnect between the assumptions of my informed
colleagues and the reality of the cyber landscape is vision and sight.
[**[Cyberthreats]{.mark}** often **[fall in between]{.mark}** and within
the context of our **[blindspots, hackers and non-state actors]{.mark}
use the fact** that much of what they do, be it malware or ransomware
toward a hospital, misinformation or disinformation online, or direct
attacks on networks or individuals]{.underline}, all too often are
[relegated to page A7]{.underline} instead of the front page
[and]{.underline} largely [away from public vision]{.underline}.
However, [**[if]{.mark}** say, **a series of [bombs]{.mark} were
[exploded]{.mark}** paralyzing the financial sector of a major American
city the focus would immediately be apprehended and **the
[eyeballs]{.mark} of** many **Americans [would be glued]{.mark}** to
said attack.]{.underline}

This approach is both normative and theoretical in that it is directed
at a central question: [why do people misconstrue or fail to take
seriously cyber threats?]{.underline} We argue that **[for democracies
to thrive]{.underline}** with well-informed voters making decisions in
their elections and transmit their policy preferences to their elected
leaders. But this [**requires the referential Self to effectively
understand and develop their own identities relative to the national or
effective assessments of threat must be possible**.]{.underline} Placing
OST in the conversation helps us to organize how publics conceive of
their security and organize it into preferential voting behaviors. This
folds in notions of threat and visibility, as well as the presumption
that to properly ascertain how threatening an action may be is entirely
relative to the perception that the problem is something tractable
enough to apprehend, and cognizable enough to properly fold into an
existing structuration of concern. Voters in an overwhelming information
environment may fail to properly aggregate potential threats to their
governments or persons, but this does not mean those threats do not
exists. It only means we (as the public) may fail to properly tabulate
and understand how those threats relate to our lived experience.

[Ontological security theory as a set of practical and empirical
assumptions about state and individual behavior is an important tool for
heuristically constructing how preferences are sorted in an atmosphere
of threat and contestation.]{.underline} Huysmans's (1998) study is
particularly important for this work because it situates how states come
to view internal/external others as threats to the self/identity both in
terms of space and vision. Because, as Huysmans argues, OST is founded
upon relational security practices and the ability to perceive which are
and are not manifest security threats is hotly in contention and is
driven "by 'securitizing' the unknown into an identifiable threat"
(Steele, 2017). The unknown in this case can be typified, though not
flippantly, by the "half a billion cyber security breaches in first
semester of 2014" (Oltramari et al., 2014) or the "16,555
vulnerabilities between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2018" (Syed,
2020). This picture of the cyber horizon is made even more chaotic when
one recognizes that "65% of the victims of intrusion and information
theft in the private sector are notified by third parties and that the
detection process usually takes up to 13 months" (quoted in Syed, 2020).

To effectively evaluate threat in the realm of cyber security means
being able to effectively adjudicate how and where threats occur. For
Huysmans (1998) in the practical realm of OST, this means identifying
the other or securitizing the problematic party. For those in the cyber
security community (computer scientists, data systems managers, and
cyber security analysts) this means creating a common language to
describe threats and to properly allocate culpability. They describe the
problem as "cognizance" or the ability to create a "reliable perception
of the elements of the environment and...the explicit representation of
their semantics" (Syed, 2020, p. 54). The promotion of a shared
conceptualization of chaotic and often covert threat attempts to, "shape
that chaos into a framework of meaningful chunks of knowledge, turning
the operational disarray into a systematic model" that gives
practitioners and theorists purchase on dealing with cyber threats. To
understand cyber is to adapt or adopt a common language to create a
landscape of cyberthreats. Thus, the realm of threat is not hard to
understand as even those closest to the problem are aware that lacking a
basic knowledge of common elements has created chaos. How then are
normal people meant to understand the cyber realm as a position of
threat?

In this regard Kinvall's work is helpful because it organizes the
[terminology and language of threat around a common source of
loss]{.underline}. For example, the election hacking and disinformation

establishment of norms and routines around threat is dynamic and
shifting, even as the human drive for certainty remains]{.underline}
(Onuf, 1998). Societies are driven by a sense that a coherent picture of
personal security is possible and preferable even if the notion of how
that world outside is created is problematic and fractured. As
researchers we desire things as well, including, a "coherent Self"
(Steele, 2017) but paradoxically these may be those that are most
capable and likely to commit acts of violence (Steele, 2017). Again,
though, this requires a construction of the Self relative to a manifest
threat and a creation of a sphere of safety around a perceived possible
security or insecurity. Krahmann argues that just such a security sphere
exists in the marketing of cyber-security to European Union (EU)
communities. The promotion by the state of anxieties around threat first
appears in notion of terrorism and migration in the EU. But migrates,
one might feel, inevitably, to the realm of cyber security. Krahmann
argues that while "Fear can be addressed by eliminating a threat,
anxiety cannot" (2018: 358).

This is precisely the problem: **[[anxiety without vision is
lost]{.underline}]{.mark}** on voters and policymakers not directly
focused on the issue of cybersecurity. Because the cyber realm is
largely opaque to the outside world and because individuals,
corporations, public utilities, hospitals, or governments who suffer
from cyber attacks often hide these attacks out of shame, embarrassment,
or for security concerns no trauma is effectively transmitted and thus
no concerted popular response is generated.
**[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}** piece [**[is not opining for
another]{.mark}** global **[war on terror,]{.mark}** nor is it seeking
some sight of popular trauma to serve as a benchmark for the dangers of
cyber warfare,]{.underline} what it is fundamentally concerned about is
the dramatic uptick in cyberattacks (the Russian attack on the
Ukrainian2 and Georgian3 power grids, the ongoing Solar Winds hacks4 ,
the Russian theft of State Department emails5 , or the constant barrage
of Chinese attempts to obtain intellectual property6 ) and the failure
of the public to cognize that there are no redlines in cyber.

Other than the ICANN framework7 which is at this point not codified into
international law or recognized by the UN, there are no established
rules of the road, proportionate responses in terms of Just War Theory,
or mitigative efforts short of backroom diplomacy. [**What [a just

**Mckeever 20** (Amy Mckeever, JULY 30, 2020, \"How the Americans with
Disabilities Act transformed a country,\" History,
<https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/americans-disabilities-act-transformed-united-states>
) //RB

[More than 2,000 disability rights advocates gathered on the South Lawn
of the White House in Washington, D.C., on a hot summer day. It was July
26, 1990, and they'd come together to witness one of the most momentous
civil rights victories in decades: President George H.W. Bush signing
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) into law.]{.underline}

During the signing ceremony---days after the Fourth of July---[Bush
admitted that the United States hadn't always lived up to its founding
principles of freedom and equality. "\[T\]ragically, for too many
Americans, the blessings of liberty have been limited or even denied,"
he said. "Today's legislation brings us closer to that day when no
Americans will ever again be deprived of their basic guarantee of life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."]{.underline}

**[[The ADA not only provided comprehensive civil rights protections for
people with disabilities for the first time in the nation's
history]{.mark}, but it also [marked a sea change in the nation's
attitudes toward disability rights]{.mark}. Here's how the landmark
statute came to be, and how it transformed the country.]{.underline}**

The disability rights movement gains steam

Throughout history, people with disabilities were feared and ridiculed
for their perceived defects and pushed to the margins of society. By the
1960s, that discrimination had been codified. People with disabilities
were excluded from public schools, involuntarily sterilized, sent to
live in state-run institutions, and even denied the right to vote. Some
U.S. municipalities even had so-called "ugly laws" prohibiting people
with "unsightly or disgusting" deformities in public places. It was a
world designed not to include people with disabilities. Government
buildings and private businesses alike lacked ramps and elevators, while
public transportation rarely provided accommodations for people with
mobility or visual impairments. Having a disability was considered a
medical problem to be solved rather than an identity to be protected
under non-discrimination laws. But things began to change in the 1970s.
Inspired by the civil rights movement of the 1960s, disability rights
advocates became more vocal in their demands that their rights ought to
be guaranteed as well. Disability had also become more noticeable as
wars in Vietnam and Korea returned thousands of soldiers with lasting
injuries. In 1973, advocates won the passage of Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act, which prohibited programs receiving federal funding
from discriminating against people with disabilities. It was the first
piece of legislation to use the term "discrimination" to describe the
limitations that these Americans face.

[For the law to go into effect, the government would have to issue
regulations defining who qualifies as a person with a disability and
what constitutes discrimination in the disability context]{.underline}.
The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare put off issuing those
regulations for four years as they wrestled over the terms. Impatient
with the delay---and worried it meant the regulations would be
weakened---advocates organized protests around the country. [In April
1977 they launched a sit-in at a federal building in San Francisco that
would last for 28 days---the longest peaceful occupation of a federal
building in U.S. history---and **result in victory**.]{.underline}

The need for a comprehensive civil rights law

[With Section 504, the American public began to understand that making
accommodations for people with disabilities was a civil right rather
than a welfare benefit.]{.underline} It also galvanized a growing
disability rights movement that won several other important victories in
the 1970s and 1980s---including legislation that guaranteed a free
public education to children with impairments and prohibited housing
discrimination on the basis of disabilities. Yet discrimination
persisted. In 1979, the Supreme Court ruled that the nursing school at
Southeastern Community College in Whiteville, North Carolina, was not
required by Section 504 to accommodate a hearing-impaired applicant. In
other circumstances, regulations were simply not well enforced. For
example, transit authorities were left to decide for themselves how
accessible they needed to be. (A skull discovered in Spain suggests that
early humans cared for disabled children.) In the mid-1980s, advocates
came to the conclusion that the critical next step was to push for
comprehensive civil rights legislation for people with disabilities. The
National Council on Disability commissioned a report on the need for
such a law, while its vice chair Justin Dart---who would later become
known as the "Godfather of the ADA"---embarked on a national tour to
discuss disability policy with local officials and gather stories of the
discrimination people with disabilities faced. These advocacy efforts
made an impression on both sides of the political aisle. Disability
rights had become a bipartisan issue thanks to years of changing public
perceptions. In 1988, Senators Lowell Weicker, a Republican from
Connecticut, and Tom Harkin, a Democrat from Iowa, introduced the
Americans with Disabilities Act. After years of revisions, amendments,
and negotiations, the bill was passed, and on that July day Bush---who
had made civil rights legislation for people with disabilities a
campaign promise in 1988---signed it into law with Dart by his side.

[Why the [ADA]{.mark} matters]{.underline}

[The Americans with Disabilities Act was a [sweeping piece of
legislation]{.mark} that [banned]{.mark} [discrimination]{.mark} on the
[basis]{.mark} of [disability]{.mark} in employment, public
accommodations, public services, transportation, and
telecommunication]{.underline}. It finally afforded people with
disabilities the same protections that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had
provided on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national
origin.

\"**[It [is the world's first declaration of equality for people with
disabilities]{.mark},\"]{.underline}** [Dart wrote after the ADA was
passed. \"[It will proclaim to America and to the world that people with
disabilities are fully human;]{.mark} that paternalistic,
discriminatory, segregationist attitudes are no longer acceptable; and
that henceforth people with disabilities must be accorded the same
personal respect and the same social and economic opportunities as other
people.\"]{.underline}

[The [ADA]{.mark} [launched]{.mark} the process of [building a more
accessible world by ensuring that buildings, schools, and public spaces
were equipped with ramps, elevators, and curb cuts.]{.mark}]{.underline}
It [made travel easier by requiring operators to make accommodations,
such as offering wheelchair lifts, airport shuttle service, and rental
cars with hand controls. It also led to the rise of interpreters and
closed captioning in public communications. (These five coastal areas
have made accessibility a priority.)]{.underline}

[Crucially, this [legislation has also become a model for lawmakers and
activists]{.mark} around the world seeking [to end
discrimination]{.mark} against people with disabilities in their
countries. Since 2000, more than 180 countries have passed legislation
inspired by the ADA.]{.underline} The law is limited, however. The ADA
has been criticized for failing to increase employment among people with
disabilities---only 19 percent are in the workforce today compared with
66 percent of those without disabilities. People with disabilities are
still disenfranchised. Accommodations at polling places across the
nation are inadequate; in 2016, a government report found that 60
percent of the polling places it examined had one or more potential
impediments, such as ramps that were dangerously steep or paths in poor
condition. Meanwhile, 39 states and Washington, D.C., have incompetence
laws that allow judges to strip the vote from people they deem incapable
of participating in the democratic process, such as people with mental
impairments. Stigma and discrimination persist throughout society too.
The ADA may not be perfect, but as Dart wrote in 1990, it "is only the
beginning. It is not a solution. Rather, it is an essential foundation
on which solutions will be constructed."

[disabilities]{.mark} [from]{.mark}]{.underline}** full participation in
**[[society.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Ableism thus identifies the normate
bigotry, evaluative chauvinism, and structural injustice that people
with disabilities have to endure at the hands of the dominant (read:
nondisabled)
culture.[1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1474225X.2022.2038017)
With this articulation of the injustices suffered by people with
disabilities, the Pentecostal disability theologian Amos Yong channels
the zeitgeist, a widely shared sensibility about how equality is to be
achieved. The contemporary version of this Enlightenment **[[quest to
achieve justice]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- understood **[[as universal
equality]{.mark} -- [takes]{.mark}]{.underline}** the form of a hunt
**[[to root out]{.underline}]{.mark}** all pernicious -isms: not only
**[[racism, ableism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, evaluative chauvinism but
also patriarchalism, heterosexism **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** gender
**[[essentialism.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Put in the terms of this
special issue, it is almost universally assumed in the modern democratic
liberal space that when we (late-modern westerners) ask whether
disability is a 'driving force for change,' we understand change as a
process progressive of eliminating injustices. This paper probes the
limits and blind spots of moral change so defined in order to raise one
theological note of caution. Understanding moral change in progressivist
terms carries a momentum -- psychological and linguistically embedded --
that that can carry the moral drive for justice into a superficial and
so problematic **[[policing of language]{.mark} that [can become
unmoored from]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[more concrete work
of]{.mark} [investigating]{.mark}]{.underline}** the mechanics of
**[[specific forms of lived justice.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It is
important to ask whether it is possible that well-meaning quests for
justice can take forms that are idolatrous because
**[[they]{.underline}]{.mark}** in fact **[[excuse people from making
real]{.underline}]{.mark}** and costly **[[concrete ventures to serve
lived, actual justice.]{.underline}]{.mark}** When Yong highlights
ableism as idolatrous, he rightly draws attention to an important set of
injustices, and in a way that makes common cause with people of all
faiths and none who find ableism morally repugnant. The question I want
to ask is whether saying something is idolatry (a theological
description) is wholly equivalent to saying that it is a pernicious
'ism' (a linguistic and moral description). This distinction matters
because one fights idolatry primarily by confession and repentance,
whereas the common **[[liberal understanding]{.underline}]{.mark}** is
that one **[[fights bias and prejudice by education and institutional
reform.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Yong holds these two sorts of response
together by marrying idolatry and ableism, but it may be that the list
of aspects of ableism that he lists ('discriminatory attitudes, negative
stereotypes, and sociopolitical and economic structures and
institutions') are very differently understood if taken to be signs of
worship of a false power rather than as **[[institutional
structures]{.underline}]{.mark}** and mental attitudes which
[**[make]{.underline}** **[life harder for]{.underline}**]{.mark} some
**[[people]{.underline}]{.mark}** than others[.]{.mark} There may well
be forms of being educated about discrimination which exacerbate the
spiritual pride that assumes people do not really need to change. If so,
it is important to ask what is lost if we simply equate the very
different descriptive registers of idolatry and discrimination. These
questions matter if **[[the final aim of justice is effective social
change. It is dangerous to assume that linguistic change alone can do
this]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a claim Yong would certainly reject. No one
should doubt that we often find our way to real injustices by querying
the behaviour of people who speak disparagingly of others, in this case,
those with disabilities. **[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}** it is crucial
not to lose **[[the]{.mark} [question]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[how]{.mark}]{.underline}** successful or
**[[unsuccessful]{.underline}]{.mark}** the work of **[[rooting out
discriminatory linguistic expressions]{.mark} [has been in
achieving]{.mark}]{.underline}** changes to **[[unjust practices on the
ground.]{.underline}]{.mark}** There are very practical differences in
what it takes to combat 'discriminatory attitudes and negative
stereotypes' in contrast to changing 'sociopolitical and economic
structures and institutions.' If we call both sorts of work 'combatting
ableism' we are lumping together very different sorts of activity, from
the crafting of policy, to the analysis of cultural tropes to the
revising of formulaic public speech to the investigation of people's own
identity structures. Distinguishing idolatry and discrimination
Distinguishing between idolatry and discrimination matters because
**[[real change demands]{.underline}]{.mark}** self-examination and
repentance. It also **[[demands personal investment

[what]{.mark} [we]{.mark}]{.underline}** might **[[concretely do about
it]{.underline}]{.mark}** if we are serious about bringing about a
genuinely more just society**[[?]{.underline}]{.mark}** The modern
liberal quest to root out -isms can sometimes proceed in ways that make
it difficult to see if these investigative questions are being seriously
asked. Language policing undermines its own moral authority if this more
concrete and fine-grained analysis is not obviously being pursued. For
example, since the police killing of George Floyd in 2020 there has been
an exponential rise in interest in rooting out racial bias among
American white liberals. Yet despite this increase in intellectual
comprehension of the implications of white privilege, those who think of
themselves as white might still buy houses in places where they know
racism gives them an unfair economic advantage, not challenge racism
among family members and find reasons to resist sharing schools. Given
the structural inequalities involved in racism and the personal costs of
remaking these infrastructural barriers, crafting a 'woke' online
profile and voting for progressive causes may seem like a reasonable and
low-cost way of being an ally of victims of racial injustice while in
fact being one of the more stable ways that racism is
perpetuated.[2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1474225X.2022.2038017)
As early as 1965 Martin Luther King himself had highlighted this dynamic
in the American populace. The 'silence of friends' he pointed out, is a
longstanding feature of American racism, and is held in place as the
majority of enlightened liberals denounce racism elsewhere but explain
it away in their own back yards, where admitting it would demand costly
change. As he put it in 1967: 'most whites in America, including many of
goodwill, proceed from the premise that equality is a loose expression
for improvement. White America is not even psychologically organized to
close the gap -- essentially, it seeks only to make it less painful and
less obvious but in most respects retain
it.'[3](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1474225X.2022.2038017)
Stated philosophically: the danger of calling a concrete injustice,
against disabled people, for instance, an 'ism' -- in this case,
ableism, is to insinuate that the basic motor of justice is our work of
classifying new sets of language and thought as pernicious -isms. The
illusion is that moral change in society is essentially driven by the
reclassification of specific acts from being morally neutral, to being
morally problematic. Once something has been labelled a problematic -ism
it is then subsumed within a general class of illiberal -isms that those
who want to achieve a just society must now fight to eradicate or defend
themselves from accusations of being morally suspect. But as the case of
racism makes clear, this linguistic reclassification can blind us to our
own culpability if we are not able to name concrete ways in which we are
participants in ableism. Those who have become content to denounce
unjust -isms can often be spotted by the ease with which they compare
and implicitly equate injustices. **[[People who have developed the
habit of verbally denouncing unjust -isms often find it hard to explain
the details of concrete injustices.]{.underline}]{.mark}** There is a
symmetry between the equation of injustices and the superficiality of
one's emotional and intellectual engagement with them. For instance: are
the indubitable injustices associated with the labels racism and ableism
in fact morally or phenomenologically equivalent? There are a wide range
of questions that would need to be asked here to even begin to answer
the question of what it would mean to stamp out these two -isms. Is the
racism of one society equivalent to that of all others? In a society
that had chattel slavery in living memory, should we prioritise the
fight to eradicate racism, or should we acknowledge that disabled people
have been disparaged and mocked for most of human history, and so
deserve to receive priority in formulating our campaigns for justice and
our calls for better social policies? Should we even ask whether some
injustices are more severe than others? If we cannot ask this question,
how will we focus our efforts in fighting injustice? I am not taking a
position on any of these questions, but raise them in order to highlight
how the classing of all injustices under labels that appear to set
injustices in a single conceptual cluster may produce false equivalences
that make it difficult to investigate and admit morally important
differences between disparaging language and actually enacted
injustices.

[Disability rights enjoy a seemingly ironclad moral
consensus]{.underline}, an ostensible unanimity that is striking given
America's entrenched polarization and the antagonism surrounding other
identity movements. Many are wary of L.G.B.T. rights or the Black Lives
Matter movement, but it seems beyond the pale --- almost cruel --- to
oppose disability rights. Nobody wants to be anti-disability. Initially,
this harmony would seem helpful. [Free from partisan discord,
advancements]{.underline} for the approximately 57 million Americans
with disabilities [should be easier to achieve]{.underline}, borne aloft
by the wings of certain progress. [Why, then, do rampant unemployment
and educational disparities endure, and why does success remain the
exception?]{.underline} I think part of the reason is the insulation of
[our [pro-disabled political consensus]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its logic
[[is]{.mark} [rooted]{.mark}]{.underline} not in any deep belief in the
equal worth of citizens with disabilities, but rather [[in a general
aversion to disability]{.mark}. [This]{.mark}]{.underline} is related to
the charity impulse that has always surrounded disability --- and [[has
constrained liberation efforts by]{.mark} [assuming]{.mark} that
[inequities]{.mark} [are]{.mark}]{.underline} unfortunate but [[natural
realities]{.mark} to be mitigated through compassion, [**rather than
politically structured injustices**. There is]{.mark} also [a]{.mark}
profound [lack of disabled people in the public sphere]{.mark},
meaning]{.underline} any [substantive discussion]{.underline} that does
occur [is extremely rare.]{.underline} I suspect many people I talk to
about disability maintain an implicit hope that, if they nod as
vigorously as possible, the issue will simply go away. In this way,
support for [[disability rights]{.underline}]{.mark} is similar to the
act of expressing perfunctory thanks to military veterans. It
temporarily [[absolves us of]{.mark} the [responsibility]{.mark} to
address the heart of the matter.]{.underline} Moreover, the apparent
moral consensus may be mostly superficial. In trying to enact
accessibility, disability advocates encounter increasing resistance as
the effort and costs involved in proposals come closer to being
realized. (Consider the neighborhood store that decides it's just too
costly to install a ramp, or the community lecture that excludes deaf
attendees by refusing to hire a sign-language interpreter.) Instead of
facilitating change, false unity actually restrains change. It stifles
the more substantive conversations true progress requires. And our
inability to speak honestly --- and contentiously --- about disability
shows how the politics of disability is in this sense non-political. We
are the worse for it. [In addition to greater participation in the
public sphere, true progress for citizens with disabilities will require
a willingness to confront the issues head-on]{.underline}, even when ---
especially when --- citizens disagree on competing solutions. **[[We
must politicize disability]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- not in the
cable-news, grandstanding kind of way, but in the term's more formal
sense. The work of the Belgian political theorist Chantal Mouffe can
help illuminate what's at stake. Mouffe begins with the premise that
human relations are inherently antagonistic: Political change always
requires controversial transfers in power or prestige, and it is an
illusion to imagine politics without confrontation. Per this "agonistic"
conception of democracy, a healthy political order is one that prefers
vigorous, good-faith argumentation to complacent consensus. Until we
publicly recognize real disagreements surrounding disability and
accessibility, Mouffe would insist, we are doomed to a vacuous, empty
debate that is neither political nor productive. Recall the Kovaleski
incident. I'm not suggesting that the abhorrence of Mr. Trump's actions
is open to legitimate questioning. But [in their forcefully reassuring
comments and messages, my friends prevented any serious discussion of
disability at the level where reasonable disagreement does exist. Where
will the money come from to fund disability employment schemes? **[How
do we even define "disability"?]{.mark}**]{.underline} Despite --- and,
I would argue, partly [[because of]{.mark} --- the [broad
condemnation]{.mark}]{.underline} of Mr. Trump for his insensitivity,
[[there was no substantive public discussion]{.mark} of such
issues.]{.underline} You may be thinking, haven't we had enough politics
lately? Maybe it's a blessing that disability isn't as political as it
might be; it avoids the drama and messiness that now seem to define our
common life. Avoiding politics might be possible if
[[disability]{.underline}]{.mark} were an exclusively private affair.
But it [[is]{.mark} fundamentally [a public
concern]{.mark}]{.underline}, affecting everyone directly or indirectly
and revealing our obligations to one another as members of a democratic
society. [Issues of accessibility can be fully addressed only through
public institutions and collective effort. For the disability community,
there is no answer but politics.]{.underline} But [politics need not be
repulsive.]{.underline} That's the beauty of Mouffe's agonism: [By
legitimating clashing arguments and welcoming them into the political
fold, unproductive antagonism becomes constructive]{.underline}, and
compromises emerge.

[Disability rights enjoy a seemingly ironclad]{.underline} [moral
consensus]{.underline}, an ostensible unanimity that is striking given
America's entrenched polarization and the antagonism surrounding other
identity movements. Many are wary of L.G.B.T. rights or the Black Lives
Matter movement, but it seems beyond the pale --- almost cruel --- to
oppose disability rights. Nobody wants to be anti-disability.
[Initially, this harmony would seem helpful.]{.underline} Free from
partisan discord, advancements for the approximately 57 million
Americans with disabilities should be easier to achieve, borne aloft by
the wings of certain progress. [Why, then, do **rampant unemployment and
educational disparities endure**]{.underline}, and why does success
remain the exception? I think [part of the reason is the insulation of
our pro-disabled political consensus. Its logic is rooted not in any
deep belief in]{.underline} the [equal worth of citizens with
disabilities, but]{.underline} rather in [a **general aversion to
disability**. This is related to the **charity impulse**
that]{.underline} has [always surrounded disability --- and]{.underline}
has [constrained liberation efforts by assuming that inequities are
unfortunate but natural realities to be mitigated through compassion,
**rather than politically structured injustices.** There is also a
profound lack of disabled people in the public sphere,
meaning]{.underline} any [substantive discussion that does occur is
extremely rare.]{.underline} I suspect [many people]{.underline} I talk
to about disability [maintain an implicit hope that, **if they nod as
vigorously as possible, the issue will simply go away.**]{.underline} In
this way, [support for disability rights is similar to the act of
expressing perfunctory thanks to]{.underline} military [veterans. It
**temporarily absolves us of**]{.underline} the [**responsibility** to
address the **heart of the matter.**]{.underline} Moreover, [the
apparent moral consensus may be **mostly superficial**. In trying to
enact accessibility, disability advocates encounter increasing
resistance as]{.underline} the effort and costs involved in [proposals
come closer to being realized.]{.underline} (Consider the neighborhood
store that decides it's just too costly to install a ramp, or the
community lecture that excludes deaf attendees by refusing to hire a
sign-language interpreter.) [Instead of facilitating change, false unity
actually **restrains change.** It **stifles the more substantive
conversations true progress requires.**]{.underline} And [our inability
to speak]{.underline} honestly --- and [contentiously --- about
disability shows how the politics of disability is in this sense
non-political. We are]{.underline} the [worse for it.]{.underline} In
addition to greater participation in the public sphere, [true progress
for citizens with disabilities will require a willingness to confront
the issues head-on,]{.underline} even when --- especially when ---
citizens disagree on competing solutions. **[We must politicize
disability]{.underline}** --- not in the cable-news, grandstanding kind
of way, but in the term's more formal sense. The work of the Belgian
political theorist Chantal Mouffe can help illuminate what's at stake.
Mouffe begins with the premise that [human relations are inherently
antagonistic: Political change always requires controversial transfers
in power or prestige, and it is an illusion to imagine politics without
confrontation]{.underline}. Per this "agonistic" conception of
democracy, a healthy political order is one that prefers vigorous,
good-faith argumentation to complacent consensus. [Until we publicly
**recognize real disagreements** surrounding disability and
accessibility]{.underline}, Mouffe would insist, [we are **doomed to a
vacuous, empty debate that is neither political nor
productive.**]{.underline} Recall the Kovaleski incident. I'm not
suggesting that the abhorrence of Mr. Trump's actions is open to
legitimate questioning. But in their forcefully reassuring comments and
messages, my friends prevented any serious discussion of disability at
the level where reasonable disagreement does exist. Where will the money
come from to fund disability employment schemes? How do we even define
"disability"? Despite --- and, I would argue, partly because of --- the
broad condemnation of Mr. Trump for his insensitivity, there was no
substantive public discussion of such issues. You may be thinking,
haven't we had enough politics lately? Maybe it's a blessing that
disability isn't as political as it might be; it avoids the drama and
messiness that now seem to define our common life. Avoiding politics
might be possible if [disability]{.underline} were an exclusively
private affair. But it [is fundamentally a public concern, affecting
everyone directly or indirectly and revealing our obligations to one
another as members of a democratic society. Issues of accessibility can
be fully addressed only through public institutions and collective
effort. **For the disability community, there is no answer but
politics.**]{.underline}

Afterword: Done with the Drive?

Four years into writing about the disability drive, and three days
before this dissertation is due, I have a thought: [**maybe [it's time
to be done with the drive]{.mark}. [That]{.mark}** thought, of course,
**[contradicts everything I have written]{.mark} in this
thesis:**]{.underline} [one does not get done with the drive, check it
off a to-do list, and go on to do other things.]{.underline} [**[The
disability drive is unmasterable]{.mark}**; it is a force that cannot be
overcome.]{.underline} [Much as one might want to be done with the
drive, the drive, it seems, [is never done undoing
us]{.mark}.]{.underline} Worse (or perhaps better), although we may say
that we want the disability drive to stop its self-rupturings,
[[the]{.mark} very [notion of "wanting" is]{.mark} fundamentally
[destabilized by the drive]{.mark}, a compulsion that pushes us beyond
pleasure and beyond desire, forcing us to wonder exactly what those
concepts mean.]{.underline} [The drive goes, does, and
undoes.]{.underline} Recall the words of Jacques Alain Miller: "The
drive...always has its keys in hand." This line stays with me; whenever
I drop something (for example, my keys), it repeats in my mind.

Always with its keys in hand, the drive pushes this project to go
further. Among the most pressing questions now driving my inquiry are
Jewish ones. In the previous chapter, I critiqued the ways in which
Freud‟s developmental model of sexuality, reliant upon the theory that
ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, reinforces racialized social
hierarchies. Yet we can't label Freud as racist---or even dub him a
"dead white European man"---and leave it at that. For in the context of
the early twentieth century, Freud was not exactly European, and he was
not exactly white. In the preface to the Hebrew translation of Totem and
Taboo, Freud‟s anthropological analysis of people to whom he refers as
"savages," Freud distances himself from his Jewishness (noting his
ignorance of "the language of holy writ" and his estrangement from "the
religion of his fathers") but nevertheless emphasizes that he "has yet
never repudiated his people" (4, xxxi). Avowing that he "feels that he
is in his essential nature a Jew," Freud writes that he "has no desire
to alter that nature" (xxxi). What is this essential nature? Freud
cannot express the essence of Jewishness "clearly in words; but some
day, no doubt, it will become accessible to the scientific mind" (xxxi).

Freud made these remarks in December of 1930, an era in which so-called
scientific minds were attempting to pin down, and to eradicate, whatever
that essence of being a Jew might be. Before the end of that decade, the
Nazi invasion of Austria forced Freud to flee Vienna; he spent the final
year of his life in London. Although Freud could not have known about
the genocide to come, the threat of anti-Semitic violence forms a
crucial part of the historical context in which he developed his concept
of the death drive. "A Jew awaiting a pogrom": that haunting line in
Civilization and Its Discontents, a text published in 1933, is offered
by Freud as an example of the impossibility of imagining what it is like
to endure extreme suffering (62). The image is quickly left behind ("It
seems to me unprofitable to pursue this aspect of the problem any
further," Freud writes), but it invokes questions that keep coming. Most
saliently: why? "The Disability Drive" has perhaps taken us in the
direction of this impossible question. My project's central claim is
that repressing the drive leads to violence. [Hostility toward disabled
people, women, fat people, racialized others, poor and working-class
people, and queers has been the focus of my analysis.]{.underline} My
future work will take these inquiries further, asking about the drive's
relation to systemic racial violence.

In doing so, I will ask: **[[when the drive]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as
repressed, [**[keeps]{.underline}** **[returning, what does this
do?]{.underline}**]{.mark} As we saw in Chapter 1, Freud raised this
question at the beginning of Beyond the Pleasure Principle. Why, he
wondered, did [traumatized soldiers]{.underline} repeatedly return to
the scenes of violence that had made them ill? Building on Freud's
theorization of [**[the drive]{.mark}** as an aspect of the
psyche]{.underline} that **[[may help the organism sustain
trauma]{.underline}]{.mark}**, I will ask whether theorizing the
disability drive as a way of living through, or with, trauma might lead
to deeper understandings of lived experiences of, and social reactions
to, mental and physical disabilities that are brought on by trauma.

What connections exist between trauma and tragedy? In Chapter 2, I
argued that [[disability scholars]{.mark} might productively [reclaim
the trope of "the tragedy]{.mark} of disability." This
phrase]{.underline}, I suggested, [calls up not only the colloquial
signification of tragedy]{.underline} (as devastating loss or pointless
suffering) [but also the term‟s generic denotation]{.underline}. Further
exploring the relation between the disability drive and the genre of
tragedy will open up questions about the status of literature in
cultural analyses of the disability drive. I have performed literary
readings in this dissertation because **[[the drive, an unrepresentable
force, can come to us only by means of the
figural]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For this reason, literary texts provide
particularly rich sources for theorizing the complexities and the
obliquities of the drive. But at the same time, I have sought to
destabilize binaries between literary and nonliterary texts. By
highlighting Freud‟s linguistic choices in his medical case history
Dora; by analyzing Charles Dickens‟s and Lee Edelman‟s respective
portrayals of the character of Tiny Tim as both literary and political
productions; and by juxtaposing Freud‟s model of sexual development,
Jane Austen‟s depictions of fatness and eating, and contemporary US
American culture‟s citations of the figure of the compulsive eater, I
have drawn attention to the ways in which [the literary and the
ideological structure, and are structured by, each other]{.underline}.
In doing so, my intention has not been to use the political to master
the literary, or to employ the literary to exert control over the
political; instead, I have hoped to provoke and sustain potentially
jarring confrontations between the two.

Such confrontations can produce experiences of epistemological
disablement, rendering readers of cultural texts uncertain as to what
counts as literature, what counts as politics, and to what extent such
divides can be upheld. As we discussed in Chapter 1, epistemological
disablement can be an effect of coming into contact with the disability
drive. Stimulating uncertainties and doubts, the disability drive may
disable us all; yet this ubiquitous psychic disablement also
specifically evokes particular aspects of many disabled people‟s lived
experiences. [[Disabled people live ongoing contradictions between our
embodied realities and]{.mark} the [structure of overcoming
narratives]{.mark}, stories that are presented to us not as fictions but
as normative prescriptions.]{.underline} [We feel the effects of the
drive when we suffer the breakages and breakdowns that occur when
bodymind and overcoming narrative]{.underline} (the weight loss diet,
the getting better with exercise and meditation, or even the claiming of
a proud disability consciousness) clash and contradict---and when, for
worse or for better, some parts of our selves like these crashes. In
Chapter 2, I said that sometimes, despite our selves, we do like the
disability toward which we are driven. **[But [when it comes to the
drive]{.mark}, perhaps [it does not matter much whether we do, or don‟t,
think that we like it.]{.mark} Either way, the drive is not done undoing
us.]{.underline}**

It undoes us through pity, we saw in Chapter 3. [That affect that
self-respecting crips are supposed to shun, I argued, could instead be
conceived as a feeling that we might wish to solicit. If pity is
regarded as a feminizing emotion, and if the abjection of pity has been
effected through the culture‟s use of Tiny Tim as a trope not only for
disability‟s pitiability]{.underline} but also, obliquely, for the
clitoris as sign for an intrinsic feminine disability, then perhaps we
should reconsider the impetus to take Tiny Tim out of the cultural text.
We could take our analysis of pity further by asking whether primary
pity---which I defined as a concept that lies on the threshold between,
on the one hand, the complete erasure of the concepts of "self" and
"other" that characterizes primary narcissism and, on the other hand,
the solidification of the self in which secondary narcissism is
grounded---could be conceived as a quintessentially queercrip concept.
My concept of primary pity is construable as "queer" because its
unsettling of the categories of self and other poses a threat to
identity formations. At the same time, the concept is readable as "crip"
because, insofar as it maintains an attachment to the construction of
the self, it is indebted to the disability rights movement‟s claiming of
"crip" as a politically subversive identity. My queer cripping (or crip
queering) of primary pity will thus draw on the interventions in queer
theory and disability studies that I made in Chapter 1: it will depart
from queer theory‟s strategy of claiming postidentitarianism as a
transcendent solution to the disabling effects of claiming, and being
claimed by, culturally minoritized identities; and it will
simultaneously challenge disability studies‟ positing of proud,
nonsuffering crip identities as foundational to political activism.

**[Questions about [activism]{.mark} press us further, too. [In]{.mark}
using the lenses of [psychoanalysis and literary theory]{.mark} to
delineate aspects [of]{.mark} the [cultural]{.mark} [politics]{.mark} of
disability, I [have not laid out a guideline or program for resisting
ableist social structures]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I have sought instead
to show how developing an understanding of the disability drive---and,
in particular, attending to the violences that result from individuals‟
and cultures‟ misrecognitions of the drive---may facilitate
transformations in how we conceive of our subjectivities. Such
transformations, deeply indebted to the feminist maxim that the personal
is political, are not individual solutions akin to the overcoming
narrative. Rather, by changing how we understand our "insides," we may
contribute to changing the ways that, "outside," on the level of the
social, we relate to each other. As we saw in Chapter 4, [something as
seemingly personal as an individual‟s "relationship to food" can raise
vexing questions that, when we deny that within ourselves that drives
these questions, become the basis of damaging social structures of
fatphobia, racism, classism, misogyny, and anti-queer
prejudice.]{.underline}

**[[If the drive won't stop]{.mark} doing us, [is it]{.mark} possible
that we can allow it to do us differently?]{.underline}** In the last
paragraph of this dissertation, on the day that it is due, I feel as if
I should leave you with a message to take home: [**perhaps a user‟s
guide to the drive, a method for learning [to love this thing]{.mark}
that won‟t leave us**. If I were a queer antisocial theorist, I might
propose that we shout out, loud and proud, something like this: "We‟re
here! We‟re queer! We are the drive! And you‟ll never get used to us!"
But **[such a call]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} we saw in Chapter 1,
[**[performs a fantasy of overcoming]{.mark}** the drive **[by
identifying]{.mark}** with it]{.underline} (if you can‟t beat it, join
it); [and **[the drive is not a force that can be
overcome]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Were I to articulate my own version of
a saying evoking the feeling of the drive, it would go more like this:
"Come on; we‟re late; let‟s go---oh no, where are my keys!?" To be
clear, I am the last person who should offer advice about handling the
loss of one‟s keys. I [know the recommendations---stay calm; breathe;
retrace your steps---but rarely do I heed them. For me, it‟s closer to:
Panic! Berate self! Look for someone to blame! I have no guide for
getting over this set of reactions, but I do want to say
this:]{.underline} "The Disability Drive" has been an invitation to
think collectively about the ways that, when we feel we cannot bear the
psychic or social equivalents of losing our keys (keys potentially
serving as metaphors for other objects, the loss of which might be more
devastating), the impetus to blame someone else can harden into a fixed
idea, a truth that one refuses to relinquish. We have analyzed multiple
examples of this process: fat people stigmatized as "compulsive eaters,"
feminists caricatured as anti-sex identitarians, and chronically ill
people dismissed as "hysterical." **[[If this dissertation has a moral,
it is this: the intolerable feeling that arises when we lose keys,
control, or other objects that we think we need in order to believe in
our selves, originates not from outside us but from within]{.mark}. This
is the drive: it always has its keys in hand. [We are not done with the
drive]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Their attempt to refuse ableism within the structures of civil society is only the upending of a conflict that mystifies the fundamental antagonism that structures civil society and the world writ large: The non-being of blackness -- Anti-blackness provides coherence to the "human" subject.

For instance, what at first glance seems merely naïve―that is **[the
observation that in the U.S. "\[b\]eing disabled is just like being
black"―actually does index how disability cannot be synonymous with
Whiteness.]{.underline}** For what is suggested through the forced
parity between the construction of blackness and disability is that the
disabled body or mind cannot properly embody Whiteness in toto. And that
is what Anna Stubblefield demonstrates in "'Beyond the Pale': Tainted
Whiteness, Cognitive Disability and Eugenic Sterilization," which
iterates how disabled white persons have historically been categorized
as embodying a tainted form of whiteness. She convincingly argues that
beginning from the 1800s in the U.S. those who were considered
feebleminded, a form of cognitive disability, lost the full privileges
attendant with white citizenship. As she writes, "... to grasp
feeblemindedness fully as a signifier of tainted whiteness, it is
important to understand that the state-sponsored, involuntary
sterilization of tainted whites meant that they had, in effect, lost the
full protection that whiteness conferred in a white supremacist society"
(178; emphasis added). Not only did the so-called feebleminded whites
come to embody a compromised form of whiteness but also the " ... white
men \[and women\] labeled as criminal, sexually deviate, homosexual, ...
or insane ... " (Stubblefield 178). What Stubblefield emphasizes is that
**[[disability as a social construct cannot easily be detached from its
imbricated positioning within a network of material forces that include
not only race but sexuality, class, and gender.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Her study foregrounds **[the need for Disability studies to attend to
racialization as not a tangential focus but central to its overall
theoretical and political project.]{.underline}** Interestingly
Stubblefield's study of how disability can dispossess whites of their
"full personhood" under U.S. law seemingly lends support to what
"Dismodernism" authorizes, which is **[the idea that the suffering of
blacks can be made equivalent to not only what disabled whites come to
embody but also to all those other Others represented under the category
of "people of color." In short, [disability has the potential to
democratize civil society by recalling how all citizens are common in
their humanity―that is, equally exposed to
disability.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Yet, if we read between the lines of
Stubblefield's summary of how "feebleminded whites" can become
"tainted," the singularity of "blackness's grammar of suffering"
emerges. For **[[what distinguishes "blackness grammar of suffering" is
how it does not operate according to the assumptive logic of
capability]{.mark}. In other words, to approach "blackness's grammar of
suffering," Wilderson insists that one must be able to imagine "an
ethicality ... so terrifying that, as a space to be inhabited and terror
to be embraced" (41), it resists language. It is a "grammar of
suffering" based not upon the logic of a "lost" capacity but that of a
deontologized property, the Slave that is not "exploited and alienated"
but rather "accumulated and fungible." [The effect of this singular
grammar on]{.mark} Asian American and [Disability studies is
significant, but the impact of Wilderson's]{.mark} critique on the
"scholarly and aesthetic production" of the "Black theorist" [is
radical]{.mark} by comparison.]{.underline}** As he writes: This
\["blackness's grammar suffering"\] makes the labor of disavowal in
Black scholarly and aesthetic production doubly burdensome, for it is
triggered by a dread of both being 'discovered,' and of discovering
oneself, as ontological incapacity. Thus, through borrowed
institutionality―the feigned capacity to be essentially exploited and
alienated (rather than accumulated and fungible) in the first
ontological instance (in other words, a fantasy to be just like everyone
else, which is a fantasy to be)―the work of Black film theory \[and by
extension Black studies\] operates through a myriad of compensatory
gestures in which the Black theorists assumes subjective capacity to be
universal and thus 'finds' it everywhere. (42) Placed within the frame
of "blackness's grammar of suffering," I want to examine the
consequences of Davis's attempt to render disability cosmopolitan. While
the move has the virtual effect of equalizing all bodies around human
capacity to suffer―such an ethical cum political strategy requires the
disavowal of how concepts such as "human" and "civil society" in the
U.S. have structurally depended on the production of social death, i.e.
the Black (and the Red). As it should be obvious by now, what **[is
therefore unthinkable in Davis's attempt to make civil society cohere
around the universality of human suffering is the contingent nature of
the term human itself.]{.underline}** This in fact is what Bells intuits
but cannot name in his influential essay entitled "Introducing White
Disability Studies: A Modest Proposal." Bell's hesitation is partly
attributable to how pain or suffering is both social (that is
communicable, sharable by all humans in equal measure) and
incommunicable within Disability studies. That is, **[[Disability
studies' uneven attention to the incommunicability of suffering is
seemingly capable of accommodating the unrepresentability that is
constituent of "blackness's grammar of
suffering."]{.underline}]{.mark}** As Siebers insists,
"\[i\]ndividuality derived from the incommunicability of pain easily
enforces a myth of hyperindividuality, a sense that each individual is
locked in solitary confinement where suffering is the only object of
contemplation. People with disabilities are already too politically
isolated for this myth to be attractive" (176). Yet in an attempt to
intervene in the poststructuralist tendency to idealize "physical pain"
as site of either transcendent power or pleasure, Siebers also adds,
"... \[p\]hysical pain is \[at once\] highly individualistic,
unpredictable, and raw as reality. Pain is not a resource of political
change. It is not a well of delight for the individual" (178). What is
directly pertinent to the present essay is how the universal figure of
the "individual"- human marks the critical horizon of Disability theory.
Or, to put a finer point to it via Widerson's reading of Frantz Fanon's
Black Skin, White Mask, "... the Negro ... 'is comparison,' nothing more
and certainly nothing less, for what is less than comparison? ... \[And
as such\] 'No one knows yet who \[the Negro\] is, but he knows that fear
will fill the world when the world finds out'" (42). We find in the most
sophisticated Asian Americanist deployment of poststructuralist
strategies of reading―such as the one advanced in the influential work
by Kandice Chuh―a similar call to abandon politics based on social
identity.6 While I am in agreement with both Davis's and Chuh's
overarching critique of uniform identity, I find troubling their
wholesale critique of all identity formation as a priori essentialist.
For such framing of social identity as necessarily restrictive can only
lead to the return of the repressed in our present era of
colorblindness―the ideal of abstract citizenship. As she writes:
"**['Asian American' ... connotes the violence]{.underline}**,
exclusion, dislocation, and disenfranchisement that has **[attended the
codification of certain bodies]{.underline}** as variously, Oriental,
yellow, sometimes brown, inscrutable, devious, always alien. It speaks
to the active denial of personhood to the individuals inhabiting those
bodies" (Chuh 27). In this, **[Chuh]{.underline}**―along with Davis and
Siebers―unwittingly **[announces the displacement and the erasure of
"blackness's grammar of suffering,"]{.underline}** as their strategies
of reading the presence or absence of justice within U.S. civil society
is predicated upon exploitation and alienation of the a priori human
subject. Nevertheless, by embodying the self―Disability studies helps to
shift (though only slightly) critical theory toward an alternative
ethicality that does not programmatically endorse the idea and ideals of
abstract citizenship. For contrary to the liberal model of the political
subject that achieves "hyperindividuality" through social and material
detachment, the alternative model of subjectivity that is afforded
through the disabled body is a self that is always already in the
process of negotiating complex relations to the materiality of the
social. Thus, the embodied model of subjectivity helps to re-imagine
"personhood" as relation itself, leading not to the reification or
essentialization of self, this relational model of subjectivity demands
that any identity whatsoever be thought not as autonomous substance but
rather as a site, comprising of unfinished, mobile, heterogeneously
constituted relations across an embodied hermeneutic horizon. It bears
mentioning here that it is this interconnected and radically open vision
of "personhood" as relation that is foreclosed in the liberal model of
abstract citizenship. For in the liberal model of the self, the ideal is
to attain singular indeterminacy through the negation of such social
relations, without which no self can hope to attain intelligibility. As
Alcoff's important work suggests: Social identities ... are more
properly understood as sites from which we perceive, act, and engage
with others. These sites are not simply locations or positions, but also
hermeneutic horizons comprised of experiences, basic beliefs, and
communal values \[...\] . We are not boxed in by them, constrained,
restricted, or held captive―unless ... it makes sense to say that we are
boxed in by the fact that we have bodies . ... (287) Interestingly **[it
is by [attending to how the self is embodied]{.mark} and embedded [in
social reality]{.mark} that [clarifies the radical singularity of the
Black's structural non-relationality]{.mark}, which in turn helps to
bring into focus not only what Wilderson calls the "structural
antagonisms" that contour U.S. civil society but also unexplored
ethico-political limits and possibilities of sub-fields such as
Disability and Asian American studies.]{.underline}** For according to
Wilderson's Red, White & Black what gives internal coherence to such
terms as "human" and "civil society" in the U.S. is the disavowal of the
structural (historical) relation blacks have with what is essentially
non-human, a form of social death known as slavery. As he summarizes:
During the emergence of new ontological relations in the modern world,
from the late Middle Ages through the 1500s, many different kinds of
people experienced slavery. ... But African, or more precisely
**[Blackness, refers to an individual who is by definition always
already void of relationality. Thus modernity marks the emergence of a
new ontology because it is an era in which an entire race appears,
people who, a priori, that is prior to the contingency of the
'transgressive act']{.underline}** (such as losing a war or being
convicted of a crime), **[stand as socially dead in relation to the rest
of the world.]{.underline}** (17-8) Wilderson's intervention therefore
hinges on isolating and exposing this dual operation by which civil
society makes sense of itself to itself―the simultaneous disavowal of
and parasitic dependency on the Black. In other words, **[[the desire to
make blackness an analogue of disability amounts to denying the
structural relevancy of slavery to the formation of U.S. civil
society.]{.mark} Wilderson's reading of Fanon helps to articulate the
radical singularity of "blackness's grammar of suffering," as it
emphasizes how "... the gratuitous violence of the Black's first
ontological instance, the Middle Passage, 'wiped out \[his or her\]
metaphysics ... his \[or her\] customs and sources on which they are
based.' [Jews went into Auschwitz and came out as Jews. Africans went
into the ships and came out as Blacks"]{.mark} (38). What Wilderson
calls the ["blackness's grammar of suffering,"]{.mark} consequently,
[has no analogue]{.mark} in either the assumptive figure of the
"individual" [that subtends Disability studies]{.mark} and those other
Others within U.S. civil society that have become included within the
frame known as "people of color." In this, "blackness's grammar of
suffering" gestures toward what is unnamable, a form of suffering that
is in excess of any ethical language which is based upon the universal
figure of the human. This is how Wilderson radically undermines the
desire to transpose "blackness's grammar of suffering" into the
ethico-political language upon which civil society's depends to make
suffering (physical, psychic or otherwise) intelligible.]{.underline}**
As he writes: The ruse of analogy erroneously locates Blacks in the
world―a place where they have not been since the dawn of Blackness. This
attempt to position the Black in the world by way of analogy is not only
a mystification, and often erasure, of Blackness's grammar of suffering
(accumulation and fungibility or the status of being non-Human) but
simultaneously also a provision for civil society, promising an enabling
modality for Human ethical dilemmas. It is a mystification and an
erasure because ... their grammars of suffering are irreconcilable. (37)
Such is the logic that animates Bell's critique of Disability studies
but it does not, cannot obtain the force of Wilderson's intervention
because Bell cannot or dare not disarticulate the Black from the world.
Nevertheless both Wilderson and Bell help foreground the important fact
that even suffering obtains a "grammar," that is, has a way of
indexing―whether positively in the form of identification or negatively
through dis- or even through non-identification, the presence or absence
of a world. What Bell's and especially Wilderson's critique bring into
sharp relief is that anti-blackness is part and parcel of the episteme
that gives internal coherence to U.S. civil society. To approach
"blackness's grammar suffering" is therefore to contemplate, albeit
always indirectly, not the paradigm of disability which is always
already predicated on agency but a radical non-capacity. Wilderson's
illumination of how [the **["antagonism"]{.mark} that [obtains around
blackness is structural]{.mark} to the [formation of U.S. civil
society]{.mark} has the effect of clarifying the positioning of
sub-fields such as [Disability and Asian American studies]{.mark},
especially when their protocols aim toward establishing some form of
political justice based upon "exploitation and alienation," which [is at
odds with "blackness's grammar of suffering."]{.mark} As previously
mentioned, Wilderson draws a sharp distinction between "conflict" and
"antagonism." And this is key, as it is [only when anti-blackness is
positioned]{.mark} as an "antagonism" that the residual and structural
effects of the Slave (the non-human) [can be allowed to erupt into the
living present of U.S. civil society.]{.mark}**]{.underline} As such,
though by comparison far more optimistic than Wilderson's study,
Alexander's The New Jim Crow (2010) gives powerful evidence to
Wilderson's theory of the "structural antagonisms" that contour U.S.
civil society. This is how a critical theory based upon advancing a
colorblind world or an ethicality based upon the universal human
effectively silences the suffering of the Black. As Alexander argues:
Far from being a worthy goal ... colorblindness has proved catastrophic
for African Americans. It is not an overstatement to say that the
systematic mass incarceration of people of color in the United States
would not have been possible in the post-civil rights era if the nation
had not fallen under the spell of a callous colorblindness. ... Saying
that one does not care about race is offered as an exculpatory virtue,
when in fact it can be a form of cruelty. ... Our blindness also
prevents us from seeing the racial and structural divisions that persist
in society: the segregated, unequal schools, the segregated, jobless
ghettos, and the segregated public discourse―a public conversation that
excludes the current pariah of caste \[the incarcerated black males in
U.S. civil society\]. (228) In this, Wilderson's Red, White, & Black and
Alexander's The New Jim Crow bring into sharp focus why [the **[framing
of blackness within U.S. civil society cannot do without the ruse of
analogy]{.mark} which [effectively]{.mark} puts under [erasure]{.mark} a
"... violence which turns a body into flesh, ripped apart literally and
imaginatively, destroy\[ing\] the possibility of ontology because it
positions the Black in an infinite and indeterminately horrifying and
open vulnerability, an object made available**]{.underline} (which is to
say fungible) for any subject" (Wilderson, 38). Put otherwise, **[this
["violence"]{.mark} which is in excess of that ideologically saturated
term called Humanity [demands the infinitely difficult yet necessary
encountering with]{.mark} what gives [U.S. civil society]{.mark} the
simulacrum of ethical and political decency.]{.underline}**

On September 23, 2015, Mr. [[Jeremy McDole was executed]{.mark} by
Wilmington, Delaware police officers. Mr. McDole was [allegedly]{.mark}
a threat to himself and [suicidal]{.mark}. The]{.underline} police were
responding to a "911 call reporting that \[Mr. McDole\] had shot
himself."1 [The 911 caller can be heard yelling: "A man just shot
himself in the AutoZone parking lot \... he's fallen out of a
wheelchair."2 Mr. **McDole was [reported to the police as a
victim]{.mark}, not a criminal**. He was described as a disabled man
with injury. A man who was suicidal; in need of help. **His need, [his
victimhood, was not seen]{.mark}**. He was not recognized by the police
as a vulnerable person. **[He was seen as a Black man; a
threat]{.mark}**---a body marked for death by the danger he posed to
others. This]{.underline} stereotype [applied to his body,
**[despite]{.mark}** him being **[confined to a
wheelchair]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Like the deaths of hundreds of other
Black males in America, his execution was recorded and subsequently
released to the American public for summary judgment---just or unjust
killing of a Black man. Unlike the hundreds of Black men killed every
year in America, however, [Mr. McDole was paralyzed from the waist down
from an injury he sustained after being shot at the age of 18. **[What
threat]{.mark} did this disabled Black man pose to anyone? [Was he
armed? Did he have a gun? These]{.mark}** are the **[questions]{.mark}**
that **[define]{.mark} [Black male death]{.mark}** in this country, and
despite Mr. McDole's disability, they now define him.]{.underline} Why
is it so easy to frame the lives of Black men and boys by one act, that
same moment all the public sees where it is almost willed in unison that
these Black males are in fact yearning for death? What was it about him
being Black-male-disabled that resists consideration---did not diffuse
the presumed danger---and convey that he was not a threat?

Like many academic fields, [**[disability studies]{.mark} has been
[confronted with]{.mark} its [raced, classed, and gendered assumptions
about the body which lies at the center of conceptualizations of
disability]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Over a decade ago, Phil Smith argued
in "Whiteness, Normal Theory, and Disability Studies," that "[[whiteness
is a **normative**, **dominating**, **unexamined** power that
underlies]{.mark} the rationality of **[Eurocentric]{.mark} culture and
[thought]{.mark}**. It serves to **push to the margins** not only those
defined as **not-white**, but also those defined as
**not-Able."**]{.underline}3 Similarly, Chris Bell's "Introducing White
Disability Studies: A Modest Proposal," argues that disability studies
functions to commodify Blackness as synonymous with disability.
Reflecting on the Queer disability conference held in 2002, he writes
many disabled non-whites "could not understand the overarching mentality
of many of the attendees, perhaps best expressed by a remark made in a
breakout session: 'Being disabled is just like being black, so society
should stop hating us and give us our rights.' "4 Bell clarifies in a
footnote that **[[disability studies normalizes disability such that the
white disabled body is the]{.mark} conceptual/anthropological [origin of
disabledness]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Far from excluding people of color,
"[[White]{.mark} Disability [Studies treats people of color as if they
were white people; as if there are **no critical exigencies**]{.mark}
involved in being people of color that might necessitate these
individuals understanding and negotiating disability in a different way
from their white counterparts]{.underline}."5

[[The white]{.mark} body]{.underline}, being [**the [ideal]{.mark}
type**, [is]{.mark} then [the **basis of distortion or
disfiguration**]{.mark} which defines the disabled other. **The [racial
designation]{.mark} of whiteness [exceeds the borders of what is often
meant by identity]{.mark};** who identifies or can be identified as a
white person]{.underline}. In actuality, [whiteness speaks to something
more fundamental in the West that has come to define what it is to be
human or nonhuman. **[To be non-white is to be abnormal---evolutionarily
behind---in the phylogenetic order of human development]{.mark}.**
Those]{.underline} who are [raced have historically been constructed as
the degenerate/inferior/nonhuman opposite to the rational prototype of
the human/superior/(Western) (abled) human]{.underline}.6 An outgrowth
of nineteenth-century eugenics, "[[**degeneration** became a]{.mark}
compelling **[racial metaphor]{.mark}** such that the [colonized races
were]{.mark} [assumed]{.mark} to be **[intrinsically
degenerate]{.mark}**, and as a result could never be
improved.]{.underline}"7 [Degeneracy [suggested **biological weakness
and disease**]{.mark}, often translating "into an attribution of
diminished cognitive and rational capacities of nonwhite
populations]{.underline}."8

In the West, **[these [colonial accounts of abnormality became
dichotomizing anthropological designations separating those who are
human from those who are not human.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Those bodies
whose origin are thought to share a phylogenic distance from European
man have been thought to be the embodiment of pathology, degeneracy, and
racial inferiority. As a kind of abnormality, [[**disability** was
considered to be **unnatural and detestable**]{.mark}, while
**[normality became synonymous with]{.mark}** that which was natural and
a means "of establishing the **[universal]{.mark}, [unquestionable good
and right]{.mark}."**]{.underline}9 The moral constitution of the self,
the interior character one possesses, became associated with the
physical and mental formation of the body. Oye\`ronke Oyewumı argues
that under Western epistemology, "[The body is given a logic all its
own. It is believed that just by looking at it one can tell a person's
beliefs and social position or lack thereof."10 [Because "**the body
is**]{.mark} the **[bedrock]{.mark}** [on which **social order** **is
founded**, **the body is always in view and on
view**]{.mark},"]{.underline}11 so the somatological becomes intuitive;
that which is obvious when gazed upon. [In the West, sight analyzes the
body, and becomes the instrument used to identify biological deficiency
which is thought to indicate degeneracy and inferiority. In this
circuitous epistemology, [the **deformity of the body** is a
**reflection** upon the supposed **distortion**]{.mark} of the mind,
just as the distortion of the mind [suggests the **savage
degeneracy**]{.mark} of the body.]{.underline}

In "Pathology to Power: Rethinking Race, Poverty and Disability," Pamela
Block, Fabricio Balcazar, and Christopher Keys explain that, even in the
twenty-first century, "[the concept of disability, when applied as a
medical or psychological diagnosis, can subsume the culturally,
socially, and historically derived identity of an individual beneath a
label of pathology]{.underline}."12 Despite the supposedly progressive
social conscience of the American public, and the seemingly infinite
theoretical nuances in identity theory, [[there is
an]{.underline}]{.mark} anthropological, and dare I say, [**[ontological
problem]{.mark}**, which continues to re-emerge as the basis of engaging
those bodies perceived as disabled. **[This risk of being reduced to the
perception and anxieties of others is only amplified by the
vulnerabilities racial groups have in mainstream society]{.mark}**.
Whereas "[**white individuals** **with disabilities** can
**recognize**]{.mark} that their **[disability]{.mark}** [is the]{.mark}
main [reason why they are **discriminated against, segregated, and
oppressed**]{.mark},]{.underline} \[[disabled [minority
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}[\] [have a harder time
separating]{.underline}]{.mark} [or consolidating their **[multiple
identities]{.mark}**."]{.underline}13 [**Non-whites experience
"segregation and discrimination independent of their disability.** If we
also consider the fact that poverty is a major source of marginalization
and that most individuals of color with disabilities are poor, then the
experience of disability is only one more factor in an already oppressed
existence.]{.underline}"14

But what of Black males? Despite over a decade of work identifying the
whiteness and bourgeois assumptions in disability theory, there has not
been any attempt to create specific theories of Black male disability
which engages the vulnerabilities his body has to death,
hyper-sexualization, and super-humanism in America. Even Nirmala
Erevelles's work, which does an excellent job articulating the link
between colonial concepts of inferiority, be they racial or cultural,
misses the opportunity to fully articulate the vulnerabilities
racialized maleness has within her transnational feminist disability
studies perspective.15 This is not to suggest Erevelles does not engage
the disabled Black male body. The concern she conveys for her husband
Robert who was suffering with a grade IV brain tumor is a startling
reminder of how the Black male body is perceived as a danger regardless
of its actual physical state. As a Black male, I understand her relief
when she tells the reader how lucky they both felt that most of Robert's
seizures occurred in the privacy of their own home.16 I know her fear,
the repetitive terror she experienced imagining her husband being shot
or killed because the public did not know how to react to a Black male
body seizing. Erevelles is correct: "[**[The Black male body]{.mark}**
\... [is]{.mark} a source of **[terror]{.mark}** in white patriarchal
society, and when [transformed during a **grand mal
seizure**]{.mark}---with [rolled back eyes]{.mark}, harsh [grunting
sounds]{.mark}, [mouth drooling]{.mark} bloody foam, [and]{.mark} the
occasional [loss of control]{.mark} of bodily function [with]{.mark} its
associated [putrid smell---could]{.mark} [become]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n
even more [**terrifying spectacle** as a result of]{.mark} the now
lethal triple combination of [**race, gender, and
disability."**1]{.mark}]{.underline}7 But [what conditions the maleness
of this Black disabled body? What is the role Black man plays in
Erevelles's knowledge that "to be perceived as a dangerous black man in
the wrong place at the wrong time \... could result in death,"18 and the
public's fear that even a disabled Black man is Black and male enough to
pose a threat?]{.underline}

[There is an asserted claim in gender theory holding that maleness need
not have a separate theoretical account as an attribute of the racial
body, as it represents privilege, domination, and hegemony in its
relation to femaleness]{.underline}.19 For many, acknowledging the
horror the Black male body conveys is enough, but [the lack of an
explanatory account as to why **[the Black male body is peculiarly
dehumanized within patriarchal racial logics leaves the multiple levels
of vulnerability Black males experience unexplored and
untheorized]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While it is obvious to many that
Black males are seen as dangerous, it is often unacknowledged that
[[Black men and]{.mark} [boys have a]{.mark} long [history of being
**victims of rape, sexual violence, and
cannibalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.20 [[Black maleness is]{.mark} easily
[**acknowledged** as being the cause of **white aggression and
violence**, but]{.mark} these [**ignored violence**(s]{.mark}), **which
[exist in the sexual register]{.mark}**[, are thought]{.mark} to be [of
no consequence]{.mark} to how Black men and boys are perceived, desired,
and feared.]{.underline}21 This essay attempts to remedy this deficit in
theory how the Black male body generally, and the disabled Black male
body more specifically, is engaged as a phobia-inspiring entity. Because
the Black male body is confined to the realm of terror---a living
corporeal horror---I argue the recognition of physical or mental
disability by white onlookers is subsumed by white fear. In other words,
disability in the Black male is unrecognizable by whites because of a
very real racial anxiety.

Capitalism, Disability, and the relative surplus population I would like
to start by establishing the grounds on which I shall build my
reflections. My first and final argument is that **[[disability in
capitalism is a social product of the contradictions produced by the
clash between forces of exploitation and forces of
labour.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It is rather important to clarify,
perhaps to the despair of postmodern perspectives (Eagleton 1998; 2016;
Harvey 1990), that I shall focus my considerations on **[[what we could
call a materialist universalising view of the body and the mind, a body
and mind that are expected by capitalism, the labour body/mind.]{.mark}
[The body/mind that is able to work and to sell its labour force in the
market, so that it may extract surplus value from this abled-to-work
body/mind.]{.mark} [The contrast of the abled labour body/mind is the
disabled body/mind, which is a term "used to classify persons deemed
less exploitable or not exploitable by the owning class who control the
means of production in a capitalist economy"]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Russel 2019, p. 42). **[[Those "deemed]{.underline}]{.mark}** less
exploitable or **[[not exploitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**", deviant from
the ideal labour body/mind, may **[[be considered]{.underline}]{.mark}**
part of what Karl Marx calls **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}** Stagnant
**[[Surplus Population]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Figure 1), or the third
category of the Relative Surplus Population (floating, latent, and
stagnant) or Industrial Reserve Army (Marx 1990) -- discussed in chapter
25 "The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation" of the first volume of
the Capital. Although a famous quotation amongst Marxists is commonly
used to summarise the author's arguments3 , I would like to linger a
little longer on his discussion of the Relative Surplus Population in
order to establish **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}** theoretical
**[[connection between]{.underline}]{.mark}** a stagnant
**[[surplus]{.mark} [population]{.mark} [and the materiality of the
lives of people labelled disabled in the capitalist
society]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the 21st century[.]{.mark} Marx (1990,
p. 794) argues that The relative surplus population exists in all kinds
of forms. Every worker belongs to it during the time when he is only
partially employed or wholly employed. Leaving aside the large-scale and
periodically recovering forms that the changing phases of the industrial
cycle impress on it, so that it sometimes appears acute, in times of
crisis, and sometimes chronic, in times when business is slack, we can
identify three forms which it always possesses: the floating, the
latent, and the stagnant. David Harvey (2010, p. 145) clarifies that
**[t[he surplus population is what "permits capitalists to super-exploit
their workers without regard for their health or
wellbeing".]{.mark}]{.underline}** Marx understands that there is a
relation between the growth and accumulation of capital and the demand
for a labour force, as capital expands so does the need for more
workers - "\[a\]ccumulation of capital is therefore multiplication of
the proletariat" (Marx 1990, p. 764). However, if the number of workers
employed increases, so does the price of labour - an increase on wages -
which means "a reduction in the unpaid labour the worker has to supply"
(Marx 1990, p. 770). Despite its apparent simplicity, this movement is
nevertheless more complex than it appears to be4 , but it can be
summarised as follows: it is capitalistic accumulation itself that
constantly produces, and produces in the direct ratio of its own energy
and extent, a relativity redundant population of labourers, i.e., a
population of greater extent than suffices for the average needs of the
self-expansion of capital, and therefore a surplus-population. (Marx
1990, p. 782, my highlights). For starters, we should not forget that
the sole aim of the capitalist is to produce profit5 . Capitalists are
ruled by what Harvey calls "the coercive laws of competition" (2010, p.
146), in Marx's words: "a coercive force external to him" (1990, p.
381). When wages rise, they become an obstacle between capitalists and
the maximum amount of profit that can be extracted. More elements will
then come into place, among others, the intensification of the
exploitation of the work force and the use of technology to increase
productivity and profitability (Harvey 2010; 2011; Marx 1990). One
example that may be useful to illustrate such an abstract relation is
that of bank workers in Brazil in the last 30 years. In the 1990s, bank
employees in Brazil created influential labour unions to exert pressure
on banks, therefore demanding higher quality jobs - higher salaries,
less working hours, more job places, amongst others. When going on
strikes, until the early 2000s, those unions would still have some
influence in the decision-making process in the organisation of banks.
In 2020, the widespread use of the new technology, which allows users to
solve most of their needs using their smartphones, has caused demands
for higher productivity, wage drops, more working hours, and an increase
in unemployment in the sector - industrial reserve army. While strikes
of the sector in the 1990s were catastrophic (crowds of employees on the
streets, freezing of banks, very little or no money available, the
support of the population), a strike in 2020 gathers a few dozen with
signs in the streets that are usually ignored by most passerby, looking
down at their smartphones. Leading us then to an important hallmark of
capitalist labour exploitation practices: The Industrial Reserve Army as
a regulator of the tensions between the exploiters and the exploited. As
capital multiplies and grows, it also tends to follow two internal
movements, namely concentration and centralisation. Respectively, the
augmentation of capital and control of this capital in the hands of
fewer people. At the other pole, it also produces what Marx called in
the previous quote "a relatively redundant working population", that is,
the surplus population (Marx 1990, p. 782). This surplus population
forms an army of workers who may at times be absorbed or rejected by the
capital, according to the capital's own needs (variation in the number
of workers in a certain area), requirements (level of education,
expertise, and/or experience), rules (wages/salaries, working hours,
holidays, health insurance). In other words, "the working population
therefore produces both the accumulation of capital and the means by
which it is itself made relatively superfluous; and it does this to an
extent to which is always increasing" (Marx 1990, p. 783). In the case
of Brazilian bank clerks, the introduction of new technological
machinery, as Marx calls it, allowed banks to dispose of thousands of
employees and change the rules of the game, it developed new needs and
new requirements. The first category of the relative surplus population
characterises workers that are "sometimes repelled, sometimes attracted
again in greater masses" by the job markets (Marx 1990, p. 794). A
modern example may be the situation of engineering workers in Brazil -
when the economy is growing, they are the first ones to be absorbed and
to get higher salaries and better conditions of work. However, as the
economy slows, they are repelled by the companies, made redundant, and
will be unemployed again. The latent category represents those with
potential to be part of the capitalist labour force but are in
agricultural areas still struggling to survive with their own practices
against massive capitalist companies; it is the representation of the
death of a rural lifestyle. As cities and companies grow, they swallow
small family farms and ranches, leaving those families with no other
option but to sell their properties to the big companies, move to the
cities, and sell their labour force. It is a situation portrayed in
literature by Theodore Dreiser in The Lost Phoebe (1918) and by
Graciliano Ramos in Vidas Secas (1938), and more recently in the
American sitcom The Ranch (2016-2020), and vastly discussed in the works
of Raymond Williams. The last category, the stagnant, is formed by those
who must subject themselves to the lowest conditions of work, to the
most irregular forms of employment, and to "a maximum of working time
and a minimum of wages" (Marx 1990, p. 796) - a sediment of the working
class that lives in the poorest conditions of life. Now that we have
reached the stagnant category, we should remember that when Marx is
discussing the three forms of relative surplus population, he is
categorising workers, in other words, those who are forced to sell their
workforce because they do not own any means of production -- der
Arbeitsmensch. They are those who are able to sell their workforce;
those who are at their full capacity in body and mind to create surplus
value at the lowest cost, with the lowest adaptation possible, as it is
remarked by Marx (1990) and by Engels (1987). In contrast, **[[when
dealing with disability]{.underline}]{.mark}**, we are considering
**[[those]{.underline}]{.mark}** who have been **[[labelled by
capitalist practices]{.underline}]{.mark}**, symbols, and meanings
**[[as disabled, unproductive, and as a burden to the rest of the
working class. A burden to the]{.mark}]{.underline}** rest of the
**[[working class because]{.underline}]{.mark}** "what becomes of the
operative..., in case **[[he cannot work]{.mark}, [is no concern of the
employer]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (Engels 1987, p. 543)[.]{.mark} Engels
here sheds light on an important element of our discussion: **[[the
class condition is a fundamental aspect of analysis when we are
discussing disability.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Marx (1990, p.797, my
highlights) enumerates three categories of those who dwell in pauperism
-- the lowest sediment of the relative surplus population', (1) those
who are able to work but who are not working; (2) orphans and pauper
children; and, finally, (3) 'the demoralized (sic), the ragged, and
those unable to work, chiefly people who succumb to their incapacity for
adaptation, an incapacity which results from the division of labour...
Note that here he is dealing with the incapacity of adaptation. And he
goes on to identify these workers as those "who have lived beyond the
worker's average lifespan; and the victims of industry... the mutilated,
the sick..." (1990, p. 797, my highlights). **[[Marx
approaches]{.underline}]{.mark}** both the issues of ageism and
**[[ableism]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the same category **[[to indicate
that those who are deemed useless by capitalist practices and excluded
from the labour market will dwell in pauperism.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
To clarify, pauperism is The hospital of the active labour-army and the
dead weight of the industrial reserve army. Its production is included
in that of the relative surplus population, its necessity is implied by
their necessity; along with the surplus population, pauperism forms a
condition of capitalist production, and of the capitalist development of
wealth. It forms part of the faux frais of capitalist production: but
capital usually knows how to transfer these from its own shoulders to
those of the working-class and the petty bourgeoisie. (Marx 1990, p.
797). It seems to be implied that he differentiates the surplus
population and pauperism. They are both conditioned to the ontological
structure of the capitalist system and its ongoing wealth-making
process. When Marx brings them together, he binds them, stating that one
will be responsible for the other (the dead weight of the industrial
reserve army), he is providing arguments against the traditional
categorisation of disability as a personal and individual problem. Once
again, **[[disability is approached as a]{.underline}]{.mark}** social,
cultural, historical, and **[[class-related
issue.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In a recent study, Santos (2020)
scrutinised data on the living conditions of the Brazilian population
comparing and contrasting the categories of race, gender, and disability
with class condition. The author identifies how these elements come
together to derail people's access to a flourishing life in a racist,
sexist/ patriarchal ableism, neoliberal Brazilian society. According to
her, 30,06% of the population with a disability live with within the
range of 0-1 minimum wage (R\$ 1,100 reais) -- in Brazil this means
deprivation from a wide variety of essential goods and services, i.e.,
living in pauperism or close to pauperism. From another geographical
perspective, in the United States, according to Erevelles (2011, p. 56),
"\[...\] "one out of every four disabled people lives below the poverty
line, and more than 75 percent have an individual income of less than
\$20,000." In the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, Marx
discusses the existence (Dasein) of the Arbeitsmensch in the
labour-capital relationship. He points out that "\[**[[p\]olitical
economy... does not recognise the unoccupied
worker]{.underline}]{.mark}**, den Arbeitsmenschen, in so far **[[as he
happens to be outside]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[the\]
**[[labourrelationship]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (1988, p. 86), that is,
**[[it]{.mark} [does]{.mark} [not]{.mark} [recognise]{.mark}
[their]{.mark}]{.underline}** Dasein, their
**[[existence.]{.underline}]{.mark}** According to Marx, "they are
figures (Gestalten)..., specters(sic) (Gespenster) outside the domain of
political economy" (1988, p. 86). Those deemed less exploitable or not
exploitable are ghosts to a system that values profit over anything
else. As I pointed out, when we consider **[[the "class-disability"
relationship in the working class]{.underline}]{.mark}**, we are
**[[deal]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing [**[with]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
sphere of pauperism -- **[[those on the lowest, poorest, most degrading
conditions of life.]{.mark} [These are]{.mark}]{.underline}** either
**[[those]{.mark} [who]{.mark}]{.underline}** refuse to follow the
system of discipline imposed by the capital or those who **[[deviate
from the ideal labour body/mind.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Harvey (2010,
p.149) points out that: there is the problem of what to do with people
who don\'t conform and are therefore dubbed odd or even deviant. And
this is Foucault\'s as well as Marx\'s point: they are called mad or
antisocial and incarcerated in insane asylums or prisons; or as Marx
notes, they get put in the stocks, mocked and punished. **[[To be a
\"normal\" person]{.underline}]{.mark}**, therefore, **[[is to accept a
certain kind of spatiotemporal discipline convenient to a capitalist
mode of production.]{.underline}]{.mark}** What
**[[Marx]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[demonstrates]{.underline}]{.mark}**
is that this isn\'t normal at all - [**[it\'s a social construct that
arose during this historical]{.underline}**
**[period]{.underline}**]{.mark} in this particular way and **[[for
these particular reasons.]{.underline}]{.mark}** According to Harvey, to
be normal is to conform. **[[Those who deviate will be labelled as
abnormal]{.underline}]{.mark}**, irrelevant, will be deemed useless,
**[[and set aside. So, normality does exist for
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- and it is very specific. On the one
hand, it does not mean that we should simply accept it as a universal
truth. On the other hand, we should not deny normality either but
address it and question it. **[[Theoretical and methodological
perspectives that aim to refuse the existence of these antagonistic
forces -- normality and abnormality -- in capitalist
practices]{.underline}]{.mark}**, symbols, and meanings, in an attempt
**[[to promote equality and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the so-called
**[[inclusion]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**[contribute to the ontological
reproduction of the system that created]{.underline}** **[the antagonism
in the first place.]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[Labelled]{.mark}
[as]{.mark}]{.underline}** irrelevant and **[[disposable]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [the]{.mark}]{.underline}** political and **[[economic
structure,]{.mark} [disabled people]{.mark}]{.underline}** may be
allocated in the Stagnant category of the Relative Surplus Population.
In fact, even when they are absorbed by the system in times of need or
when the system is forced to absorb them by affirmative action policies,
those in the stagnant category "[**[can be rendered superfluous at the
slightest downturn]{.underline}**]{.mark} of the business cycle" (Russel
2019, p. 76). Barnes (1992, p. 55) defines disability as "a diverse
system of social constraints imposed on people with impairments by a
highly discriminatory society --- to be a disabled person means to be
discriminated against". A social approach to disability, therefore, does
not deny the impairment, but understands that there is a
socio-historical difference between impairment, disability, and
disabled: the impairment is biological, the disability is social, and
disabled is the end result of disabling a person with an impairment6 .
Vygotsky (1993, p. 36) argues that "\[i\]n the final analysis, what
decides the fate of a personality is not the defect \[impairment in
today's terminology\] itself, but its social consequences". And it is
this socio-psychological realisation that may or may not be a disabling
one. In their development, disabled children will only require processes
that will stimulate them in other ways rather than those traditionally
applied at home, school, and any other social situation. As deviants of
the patterns of normality, however, disabled people are many times
completely or partially deprived of social participation. Deviant bodies
and minds are expected to either follow the stabilised rules of society
or not be part of it at all. Let us take a scene in Jack Nicholson's One
Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest as an example. His character, Randle P.
McMurphy, is in the swimming pool of a total institution for those
considered mentally ill and/or intellectually disabled and tells one of
guards that within six days he is going to leave the institution. To his
surprise, according to the guard, he will only leave the institution
when allowed to, when the doctors and nurses consider that he is able to
adjust to social order. Randle is only pretending to have a disability
to dodge prison, but to many of his companions it means never leaving
the institution, because **[[according to]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
rules, requirements, and needs of the **[[capital they have already been
deemed deviant and disposable]{.underline}]{.mark}** or, as Harvey put
it, they are "incarcerated in insane asylums or prisons \[...\] they get
put in the stocks, mocked and punished" (2010, p. 149).

### 2NC \-\-- Root Cause 

#### The political economy is the best analytic to explain forms of ableist violence that lead to material impacts that disabled populations must face. Only understanding "competence" as indebted to the structures of productivity and labor relations can reshape WHAT society values.

Disability and the Ideology of Competence As stated, I am not going to
analyse [**[the disabling]{.underline}**
**[phenomena]{.underline}**]{.mark} beyond the sphere of capitalism, but
rather to understand them **[[as part of the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
complex **[[system of ontological maintenance of]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the **[[capital]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Mészáros 2011)[.]{.mark} One way
(not the only way) to do that is to **[[approach]{.mark}, [from a
materialist perspective]{.mark}, [the ideological discourse
of]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[competence.]{.mark} [It
unveils]{.mark}]{.underline}** not only **[[what]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
[expected]{.mark}]{.underline}** from the working class but
**[[also]{.mark} [what]{.mark} [is]{.mark}]{.underline}** to be
**[[discarded.]{.mark} [Competence]{.mark} [is]{.mark}]{.underline}** a
concept that is **[[in dialectical relation]{.mark}
[with]{.mark}]{.underline}** the concepts of **[[class,]{.mark}
[exploitation, and individual.]{.mark} [Social
class]{.mark}]{.underline}**, one's position in the economic and
political structure of capitalism, will **[[have a direct impact]{.mark}
[on]{.mark}]{.underline}** the limits imposed on and
**[[possibilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** opened up **[[to]{.mark}
[individuals.]{.mark}]{.underline}** That is, humans make their history,
but they are determined by sociohistorical forces beyond their control
(Marx & Engels 1968). Therefore, **[[a materialist reading of
disability]{.underline}]{.mark}** may **[[largely]{.mark}
[contribute]{.mark} [to]{.mark}]{.underline}** deepen and
**[[expand]{.underline}]{.mark}** the scientific **[[knowledge]{.mark}
[around the disabling phenomena.]{.mark} [Social
class]{.mark},]{.underline}** albeit a commonly forgotten category
**[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}** the analyses of **[[disability]{.mark},
[is]{.mark}]{.underline}** an **[[essential]{.underline}]{.mark}**
aspect of it[.]{.mark} There are complex divergencies between facing an
impairment in the higher classes, in the middle-classes, or in the
lower-classes7 (See Erevelles 2011; Cabral 2021; Russel 2019; Santos
2020). Wright (1998) argues that **[[exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark}**
is a grounding concept when it comes to class analysis because it
**[[creates a fissure between]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[higher
classes]{.underline}]{.mark}** (the owners of the capital, land, and
means of production), **[[who exploit,]{.mark}
[and]{.mark}]{.underline}** the rest **[[who are
exploited.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The development of capitalist
relations, however, engendered new classes, a class that originates from
the social and technical divisions of labour (Wayne 2020; Wright 1998).
The middle-classes are constituted by those in the working class who
perform jobs that require more complex skills in contrast to those who
are working in manual jobs - and thus tendentiously share contrasting
interests with them. These are also called in sociological works primary
and secondary sector jobs, which respectively represent "those with high
wages, high skill levels, good working conditions, job security, and
ample opportunities for promotion" in contrast to "low wages, low skill
levels, poor working conditions, little job security, and few if any
possibilities for advancement." (Barnes 1992b, p. 57). Wayne (2020, p.
5) keenly highlights that The social division of labour is linked to
class formation because across the various branches of productive
activity designed to meet variable social needs, the same social types
in control of those branches have more in common with each other than
they do with their immediate workers, who have the least control, least
power and lowest remuneration in the production process. The
[**[maintenance of class structure and]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
inducement of competition and [**[individualism
in]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
**[[working]{.mark}-[class]{.mark}]{.underline}**es **[[is]{.mark}
[a]{.mark}]{.underline}** fundamental **[[trait to the ontological
continuation of capitalism.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The social division
of labour focuses on the formation of an un-critical, individualist, and
indebted working-middle class with no sense of unity or class
consciousness (Marx & Engels 2008; Mészáros 2008; 2011). The spread of
meritocratic values amongst the professional and managerial strata of
the working-class gives them a glamorous look and the false impression
that they are closer to the top than to the bottom, that they share more
with those in power than with those in classes below them (Wayne &
Cabral 2021). The relevance of the discussion of class lies in the fact
that when we talk about inclusion without questioning capitalism, we are
usually referring to the right to enter the labour force and be
exploited. **[[Disability]{.mark} [in]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
**[[working-class]{.mark} [demands]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
**[[absence]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline}** one of the
**[[non-disabled]{.mark} [members]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the family
from the labour market **[[to]{.mark} [provide]{.mark} [care]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [disabled]{.mark}]{.underline}**
member[.]{.mark} This care may also be relegated to a philanthropic
special institution - in the latter, allowing all working members of the
families to be absorbed by the capital (Russel 2019). It may be argued,
however, that the concepts and definitions of what it means "to be able
to work" are variable (Stone 1984). Indeed they are, but those are
regulated by the State and by the capitalists themselves, and they vary
not only influenced directly by pressures of society, but by the demands
of the capital (Russel 2019). In other words, it means to say that their
jobs and **[[the]{.mark} [place]{.mark} [they]{.mark} [occupy]{.mark}
[are]{.mark}]{.underline}** both **[[part]{.mark}
[of]{.mark}]{.underline}** a **[[regulatory system of the
capital]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as Russel (2019) argues, and a special
kind of charity - in either case [**[their workforce is easily
disposable]{.underline}**.]{.mark} If we consider here Robert Young's
(2009) analyses of **[[Marx's]{.mark} [concept]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[use]{.mark}]{.underline}** of **[[value]{.underline}]{.mark}**, we may
[in**[dicate]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[that]{.mark}: [in]{.mark}
[the]{.mark}]{.underline}** Capital's **[[commodity]{.mark}
[structure]{.mark}]{.underline}** when **[[those]{.mark} [deemed]{.mark}
[disabled]{.mark} [are]{.mark} [exchanged]{.mark}, [they]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} [exchanged]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
[less.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Erevelles (2011, p. 252) argues that
"\[...\] "**[[becoming]{.mark} [disabled]{.mark}
[is]{.mark}]{.underline}** also **[[a]{.mark} [historical]{.mark}
[event]{.mark} [where]{.mark} [disability]{.mark}]{.underline}** also
**[[has]{.mark} [a]{.mark} [use]{.mark} [value]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} [deployed]{.mark}]{.underline}** simultaneously
**[[with]{.mark} [race]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[justify]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[creation]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} [enslaved]{.mark}]{.underline}** un-gendered
[**[body]{.underline}**.]{.mark} " and that the "\[...\] actual act of
impairment that is used both to create and at the same time to justify
this construction." Proof of that have also been the recent changes in
the Brazilian legislation regarding the regulations for the mandatory
employment of disabled people. Advancements in laws and legal
regulations are indeed an important part of the struggles of the working
class, but they "are 'solutions' which promote conflict between groups
of disadvantaged workers, rather than making it a right of every citizen
to have a living-wage job and health care" (Russel 2019, p. 77). They
are part of what Mészáros (2008; 2011) regards as corrections in the
structure of the capital. They play a fundamental role in the
ontological conservation of capital when softening the tensions between
the owners of the capital and the working class. Barnes (1992) advocated
in favour of anti-discrimination legislation as a solution to improve
the participation of disabled workers in the labour market, as we all
should. No one would deny that even within the limits of the capital one
should always fight against discrimination, prejudice, and deprivation
of access to better living conditions. Notwithstanding, the market finds
its ways to 'dodge' the legislation. When it comes to disabled workers
that usually happens through what Samuels (2014) calls biocertification.
**[[Biocertification]{.mark} [is]{.mark}]{.underline}** the process
companies and industries use to certify that a new employee will follow
their not-so-secret internal rules, using medical reports, exams, and
tests. By **[[means]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline}** biocertification
**[[processes individuals]{.underline}]{.mark}** are **[[reduced]{.mark}
[to]{.mark}]{.underline}** their **[[biological]{.mark}
[characteristics]{.mark} [and are erased as social
subjects]{.mark}]{.underline}**, "\[b\]iocertification materializes the
modern belief that only science can reliably determine the truths of
identity and generally claims to offer a simple, verifiable, and
concrete solution to questions of identity" (Samuels 2014, p. 122). The
structure of capital and its relations of material and cultural
production, distribution, and exchange convey ideological models of
individuals, social relations, and patterns of social behaviour that
must be assimilated to guarantee the right to actively participate in
everyday life, from the most trivial activities to the most complex
forms of social participation. These representations will revolve around
the notions of gender, race, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and, in
the case of the working classes, labour skills. They carry labels of
non-deviant and deviant. **[[The archetype of an ideal]{.mark}
[individual]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [linked]{.mark}
[to]{.mark}]{.underline}** the project of society: Hence, **[[the
oppression that disabled people]{.underline}]{.mark}** face is
**[[rooted in the economic and social structures of
capitalism.]{.mark}]{.underline}** And this **[[oppression]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} [structured]{.mark} [by]{.mark}
[racism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, sexism, homophobia, ageism,
**[[and]{.mark} [disablism]{.mark}, [which is endemic
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** all **[[capitalist]{.mark} [societies]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [cannot]{.mark} [be]{.mark} [explained]{.mark}
[away]{.mark} [as a universal cognitive process.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Oliver 1990, p. 165). Oliver is arguing that the **[[foundations of
prejudice are in fact part of the ideological structure of
capitalism.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It a structure founded on an
ideological and hegemonic set of "ideas, values, belief systems, habits
and practices that defend and legitimise the interests of groups at the
expense of other groups in relationships of inequality" (Wayne 2020, p.
136, author's highlights). Hence, it is important here to clarify my
understanding of five concepts that are usually **[[present]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} [discussions]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline}** inequality,
prejudice, and **[[disability:]{.mark}
[oppression]{.mark}]{.underline}**, segregation,
**[[exploitation]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}]{.underline}**
inclusion/**[[exclusion]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is my understanding
that, **[[from a materialist perspective]{.mark}, [they are all
class-related issues.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Oppression derives from the
idea that due to one or more deviant characteristics one is deprived
from access to some or all material, cultural, and social conditions
that would allow them to carry on a fulfilling life or, as Wright (2019)
calls it, a flourishing life. Oppression represents an image of someone
being crushed, smashed, held (socially) against their own will and
despite their own efforts to change. **[[Oppression]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
[a]{.mark} [product]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [ideologies]{.mark}
[embedded]{.mark} [in]{.mark}]{.underline}** the social structure of
**[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** and it is related to
inequality[.]{.mark} Segregation revolves around marginalisation. The
social process in which those who are unable to follow one or more
social expectations are centrifuged, sent to the borders of society.
They are not welcomed to participate in everyday life. Segregation comes
as an alternative to the idea of social exclusion, as we shall see
below. Exploitation, in turn, is the essential concept that sustains
capital every day. The act of extracting surplus value out of those who
own nothing else but their labour power (Marx 2012). Stripped of all
properties and material conditions, workers have no way to sustain life
other than by selling their labour power to those who own those material
conditions. Modern capitalism, however, has become even more complex
than it used to be when Marx's wrote Das Kapital (Wright 2019). In order
to guarantee its own survival, the structure of class conditions was
reshaped based on the social and technical divisions of labour.
Different class interests will clash between those who own the capital,
those in positions that require higher qualification and more
sophisticated skills (the modern middle-classes), and the ones
performing jobs that are socially characterised as lower jobs (Wayne
2020). A material approach to these concepts understands that the
condition of class will determine - imposing starting points, limits,
and ends, as Williams (1988) and Wright (2019) define it - their
extensions and impacts on an individual's life. It means to say that one
may be segregated but not so much oppressed. So, the extent of the
processes of oppression, segregation, and exploitation is
class-determined. Going back to Wayne's definition of ideology, he
understands that: there is **[[capitalism]{.mark}
[itself]{.mark}]{.underline}** which **[[has a]{.underline}]{.mark}**
built-in cultural **[[tendency]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [decontextualise
]{.mark}]{.underline}**social phenomena[,
**[individualise]{.underline}**]{.mark} social phenomena **[[and
de-historicise social phenomena.]{.mark}]{.underline}** We may also add
that **[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** prematurely or **[[falsely
universalises capitalist culture and value systems]{.mark} ([e.g., the
only way to live]{.mark}]{.underline}**) (Wayne 2020, p. 137).
Therefore, **[[there]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [a]{.mark}]{.underline}**
paramount **[[comprehension]{.mark} [of capitalist
practices]{.mark}]{.underline}** when it comes
**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[analysis]{.mark}
[of]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[disabling]{.underline}]{.mark}**
phenomena[.]{.mark} When we look at Marx's exposition of the sphere of
pauperism, we were in fact targeting how this process of
decontextualisation, individualisation, and de-historicisation affect
those who are considered unable to adapt. Historically and
traditionally, **[[capitalist ideologies have treated disability as a
personal, individual]{.mark} [tragedy, which is]{.mark}]{.underline}**
brought **[[out of context]{.mark} [and history]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
in an attempt **[[to]{.mark} [exempt]{.mark}
[society]{.mark}]{.underline}** from any obligations it might
have[.]{.mark} Against this, Russel (2019, p. 51) argues that: Our
**[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** (particularly medical and social
welfare institutions) have **[[historically]{.mark} [held]{.mark}
[disablement]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [be]{.mark}]{.underline}** an
**[[individual]{.underline}]{.mark}** problem,
**[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[result]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[economic]{.mark}]{.underline}** or social
[**[forces]{.underline}**.]{.mark} They have equated disability with
physiological, anatomical, or mental "defects" and hegemonically held
these conditions responsible for the disabled person's lack of full
participation in the economic life of our society. This approach
presumed a biological inferiority of disabled persons. Their deviation
from social models of adaptation to everyday life and productivity in
the cycle of the capital, established by social standards of normality,
promotes processes of social marginalisation, from institutionalising
policies of discrimination to deprivation of social participation
(Barnes 2012; Bueno 2001; Ferreira 1994; Vygotski 2004). It is in and
from everyday life that the concepts, values, and norms that represent,
regulate and organise a concrete social formation are executed (Heller
2016). Daily life is the expression of the real life of the subjects
that are part of it, it is the immediate unity of action and thought and
expression of concepts, values and norms formed from the hegemonic
ideology conveyed and foisted upon individuals (Chauí 2016; Heller
2016). Everyday life is ordinary thinking, common sense, and the
expression of uncritical thinking. It is the embodiment of men\'s life,
and it is from it that they express their truth, build their beliefs,
and guide their lives (Heller 2016). Everyday thought, the common sense,
is based on experience in the complex ideological network that maintains
the socio-metabolic functioning of capital and aims at the "orientation
towards stability and relatively quiet social reproduction" (Mészáros
2004, p. 486- 487). The process of stigmatisation in the case of
disabled people permeates the complex social construction of everyday
life. The distancing of adaptation to the **[[patterns of
normality]{.underline}]{.mark}** established in everyday life
**[[crystallise]{.underline}]{.mark}**s the **[[stigma]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [removes]{.mark}]{.underline}** from the **[[person]{.mark}
[with]{.mark}]{.underline}** an **[[impairment]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the condition of 'human' **[[and]{.mark} [projects]{.mark}
[it]{.mark}]{.underline}** socially **[[as]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
'**[[non-human']{.underline}]{.mark}** -- as Marx's pointed out a
spectre **[[to political economy.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The
representation of the stigma occurs by a reduction of the subject to
only one of its characteristics - usually that which is downgraded or
socially overvalued (Goffman 1963). The possible overcoming of these
conditions, or even the performance of more basic daily actions, can
raise the stigmatised subject to the condition of superhuman, keeping
them still in a non-human status. A stigmatised person may, however,
reformulate the rules when they reach a position a social prestige. They
are taken to the level of representation of their group and will be
considered the example of self-determination, meritocracy, and success
(Goffman 1963; McNamee & Miller 2009; Wayne & Cabral 2021). Leonard
Kriegel (1987) scrutinised the images of representation of disabled
characters reproduced in literature and narrowed them down to four
categories, namely: Demonic ~~cripple~~, Charity ~~cripple~~, Realistic
~~cripple~~, and Survivor ~~Cripple~~. I will not discuss all of these
categories, but the last one may be useful here to illustrate my
previous arguments. The Survivor ~~Cripple~~ "\[...\] is the man who
endures and, in his endurance, discovers survival as a cause in itself
\[...\]. His endurance is attractive, both to himself and to the
audience, for it is constructed around his understanding of the
limitations it has imposed on him." (KRIEGEL, 1987, p. 38). The survivor
~~cripple~~ is the counterpart of the disabled person as pitiable and
pathetic, as an object of pity, it is the representation of meritocratic
values - the one who fights against all odds and thrives. The bridge
between class conditions and **[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** idea of a
(**[[disabled]{.underline}]{.mark}**) survivor [**[relies on
capitalist]{.underline}** **[meritocracy that]{.underline}**]{.mark}
seems to be **[[reproduce]{.underline}]{.mark}**d in the image of the
survivor, both in the **[[lower]{.mark} [and]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
the **[[middle classes.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The image of the disabled
person has been used as a motivational strategy, to trigger feelings of
determination, and has been associated with struggle and the power to
overcome difficulties, usually followed by the question "What is your
excuse?". This may be perceived in the real-life based cinematic
representations of disability, as they may imprint more credibility and
cause a greater effect on the audiences. The Survivor ~~Cripple~~ makes
the impairment a tragedy and overcoming it the objective or the solution
to the problem. The use of disability in motivational campaigns and
films projects the disabled person as an object of ridicule and as their
own worst and only enemy -- "if they wanted, they could." -- and cement
meritocratic values -- "if they did, what's your excuse?". As examples,
I could mention the biographical films based on the lives of Christy
Brown (Sheridan 2008), Gabriela Brimmer (Mandoki 1987), and Stephen
Hawking (Marsh 2014). The decades after 1990 have been marked by various
events and political and social reviews on the role and place of
disabled people in society (Jannuzzi 2004). However, the system of
justification and ideological reproduction of stereotypes in the
categorisation of the socially conceived human body, the labour body and
mind, as perfect permeates concrete social relationships in everyday
life and triggers processes of stigmatisation of the deviants (Samuels
2014; Stone 1984). Stigma is thus very much in constant relation with
the ideologies that are working through culture -- as I have
demonstrated with some examples in the previous paragraph. Competence,
structured by bourgeois ideological pillars, conveyed by the media, and
absorbed by the cultural industry, sells signs and images of youth,
health and happiness (Chauí 2016). It is a powerful method of
manipulation that "inoculate\[s\] individuals with the bourgeois
appetite for personal success" (Freire 1970, p. 147). The social process
of constructing the discourse of the competent produces its dialectical
counterpart, the incompetent. The social and ideological role of the
competent, valued by the social power of science, as an unquestionable
source of knowledge, underlies and justifies the domination and economic
exploitation of one class, considered superior in material and cultural
capital, over the other, expropriated from the whole (Chauí 2016;
Samuels 2014). The analysis of **[[perfection]{.mark}, [based on a
neoliberal ideology]{.mark}]{.underline}**, established mainly after the
1980s (Harvey 2011), **[[subjugates disability]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
the working class mainly **[[to]{.mark} [spaces]{.mark}
[of]{.mark}]{.underline}** pauperism, **[[marginalisation and
segregation]{.underline}]{.mark}** and is marked by the sociopolitical
order and the power of science[.]{.mark} **[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}**

in the opposite pole the lack and the insufficiency, emphasising **[[the
defect]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [erasing individuals]{.mark}]{.underline}**
beyond their **[[disability]{.underline}]{.mark}** and making the
construction of their social relations unfeasible (Barnes 2012; Heller
2016; Soldatic & Meekosha 2012a; 2012b; Vygotski 1993)[.]{.mark} The
naturalising element of capital is propagated and foisted upon
individuals that reproduce the social structure through complex
ideological systems of conservation, keeping individuals locked in the
relationships of everyday life. Everyday life is, therefore, the life of
every social subject, without being able to be totally out of it or
completely trapped by it. It is in everyday life that the dominant
metabolic ideological processes are emptied and reified as absolute and
natural truths (Heller 2016; Mészáros 2004; 2016). Mészáros (2005, p.
401) argues that the dominant ideology of capitalism is "\[...\]
sustained by the practical evidence of the established material
structures within which people have to reproduce the material and
cultural conditions of their existence and 'feel at home as a fish in
water'". Most of the population is conditioned by the ideological
standards set by the ruling class. Its ideological structure is: a
logical, systematic, and coherent set of representations (ideas and
values) and norms or rules (of conduct) that indicate and prescribe to
the members of a society what they should think and how they should
think about it, what they should value and how they should value it,
what they should feel and how they should feel it, what they should do
and how they should do it. (Chauí 2016, p. 53). The dominating force of
ideology lies in pacification, naturalisation of the hegemonic social
organisation and unity of interests, although they are conflicting
(Mészáros 2008; Wayne 2020; Zizek 2012). Ideology, in its hegemonic
sense, structures life lived and represents "a sense of reality for most
people in the society, a sense of absolute because experienced reality
beyond which it is very difficult for most members of the society to
move, in most areas of their lives" (Williams 1980, p. 38). It is in the
everyday life that the ideological patterns of normality are executed.
Heller (2016, p. 37) indicates that \[t\]he maturation of man means, in
any society, that the individual acquires all the essential skills for
the daily life of the society (social layer) in question. It is an adult
who is able to live his daily life for himself. Ideological patterns of
normality are socially and historically established attributes and
characteristics that are reproduced as natural and ordinary and that
categorise subjects as normal and abnormal deviant. They establish the
norms that define what it means to be a socially desired human (Amaral
1995; Everlles 2011; Heller 2011). Stigma disqualifies the individual
due to a singular characteristic that deviates from the ideological
norms and standards imposed and determines the limits of their social
participation. Lastly, I would like to go back to inclusion.
**[[Inclusion is]{.underline}]{.mark}** part of **[t[he ideological
process of self-correctness and self-preservation of the bourgeois
society.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It is an attempt to lessen the weight of
structural injustices, inequalities, segregations/exclusions that are
part of the ontological foundations of the capital. Marx's thought
elucidates how contradictory the concept is: when analysing the
production of relative surplus-value, that within the capitalist system
all methods for raising the social productivity of labour are put into
effect at the cost of the individual worker; that all means for the
development of production undergo a dialectical inversion so that they
become means of domination and exploitation of the producers. (Marx
1990, p. 799). Some lines below, he famously concludes that:
Accumulation of wealth at one pole is, therefore, at the same time
accumulation of misery, the torment of labour, slavery, ignorance,
brutalization and moral degradation at the opposite pole, i.e., on the
side of the class that produces its own product as capital. (Marx 1990,
p. 799). Inclusion, therefore, is the movement of opening opportunities
to share material and cultural capital with (some of) those who were
deprived from access to them. It does so without questioning or
challenging the very essence of the society that created deprivation in
the first place. Inclusion and exclusion are part of the same dialects.
One is the dialectical inversion of the other. The need to include only
exists because of a society that engenders exclusion. Thus, as I
suggested, exclusion might not be a real thing, in immediate cultural
and material access perhaps it does, but not as part of the structure of
the system itself, i.e., the individual is not excluded from the system,
they are a product of it. Inclusion and exclusion were uncritically
adopted by all postmodern studies of identity, and inclusion became a
motto to be fought for - as Wayne suggested (2020, p. 39), "change
without real change". In other words, these changes are constrained
within the limits of capitalism and do not represent a threat to the
structure of the system. Notwithstanding its core contradictions, it is
something we shall all fight for. If within the limits and
contradictions of the capital this is the only possibility - or the
closest possibility - some individuals will have to access a flourishing
life - meaning access to education, health, cultural expressions,
housing, food - then until the whole system changes, perhaps it is what
one should fight for. In the case of disabled people, it applies even to
the access or opportunity of access to be exploited -- as cruel as this
may sound; that is what the "inclusion for disabled people" is in fact
fighting for. In that sense, "\[**[[b\]asic changes must be made in the
economic]{.mark},]{.underline}** social, and political
**[[structure]{.underline}]{.mark}** in order **[[to advance economic
solutions that]{.underline}]{.mark}** reach beyond capitalism's
instability. The reserve army, itself, must be made a disposable
concept" (Russel 2019, p. 77). Despite the limitations of what Wayne
calls (following Gramsci) passive revolution -- "the paradox of massive
change within the social relations of capitalism: change without real
change" (Wayne 2020 p. 39, author\'s highlights) -, these seem to
represent a possibility to **[[improve]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[lives]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline}** those who are now in need, not
only focusing on **[[disabled people]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but also on
other forms of discrimination as well. My favourite and paramount
argument in that regard is that Every reasonable and reasoned action
proposed in an attempt to accelerate the social and political inclusion
of the poor in the process of economic development in order to bring
equality to social development is historically welcomed. As much within
the scope of the State and its public policies as within civil society.
It would be equally wicked to deny the diversity of the aspirations and
intervention actions in the problematic reality. (Martins 2012, p. 1).
Nonetheless, we should not be satisfied with them, for they do not
interrupt the flow and the logics of the capital.

[[Capitalism prioritizes productivity: your value and worth lie in how
much you can produce]{.mark} for profit]{.underline}. [The idea of
constantly striving toward production is interwoven at the individual
level, as evidenced by the urge to ask kids what job they want when they
grow up --- as if we dream about labor --- and at the societal level,
where a price tag is put on everything we do. This productivity-driven
mindset permeates everything in a capitalist society]{.underline}. I
grew up idolizing certain jobs: doctors, lawyers and scientists. But, my
admiration wasn't based on how these professions helped people. It was
mostly because I was taught to prioritize their salary, recognition and
prestige. In turn, people who didn't choose a traditional corporate job
were knocked to the bottom and unfairly branded as lazy, useless and
undeserving of respect. I'm still working to dismantle this mindset that
has become ingrained in me, but I've realized it's even more important
to do so when [[capitalism is integral to modern day
ableism.]{.mark}]{.underline} So, what does capitalism have to do with
ableism? Ableism is a product of capitalism[. Simply put, [the system
isn't made for people who are different. This includes people who
have]{.mark} different ambitions, prioritize happiness or family over
work, or have [a different scope of ability.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
ableist-capitalist relationship means that even if not explicitly,
society makes it unnecessarily difficult for disabled people to find
work. Non-manual labor jobs often tack on extraneous physical
requirements that are inherently discriminatory, despite claiming to
hire regardless of disability. Especially in academia, when jobs
listings require "walking, talking and hearing," for example, it sends a
very clear message. When a disabled person secures a job, the employer
might have to shift the functions of their role, or spend small sums of
money to comply with requirements set by the Americans with Disabilities
Act. So, the net profit exploited from a disabled worker may be less
than that from an able-bodied worker. To compensate, many businesses use
a loophole in the Fair Labor Standards Act to justify paying disabled
workers subminimum wage. It's worse than it sounds --- disabled workers
often earn pennies, or even gift cards, and are labeled as "substandard"
because their disability can affect productivity. Before 2014, disabled
people who received benefits such as Medicaid payments or Social
Security Disability Insurance were disqualified if they had assets
totaling more than \$2,000 or if their monthly earnings exceeded \$700.
The job hunt is very discouraging when you know you're going to face
these obstacles and could eventually be forced to forfeit your benefits.
If you were to lose your job, you would have to reapply for these
programs, which often have waitlists a mile long. The Achieving a Better
Life Experience Act was passed in December of 2014, allowing disabled
individuals to open savings accounts for certain disability costs such
as education, housing, transportation, health and basic living expenses.
But the limitations of the ABLE Act still put disabled people at a
disadvantage --- the annual gift tax exclusion, which was \$15,000 in
2020, is the limit for account contributions, and individuals must be
diagnosed with a disability before turning 26 to be eligible. As if
that's not enough, the ableist-capitalist treatment extends beyond the
workplace into daily life. Social Security rules create penalties for
disabled people who want to get married. Sure, they're legally allowed
to marry. But if they do so, they're faced with the possibility of
losing their health insurance, earning a lower monthly income or losing
their benefits altogether. Why do people have to choose between basic
necessities and love? Able-bodied, heterosexual people can joke about
getting married for the "tax benefits" while disabled people are forced
to forfeit their right to marry so they can survive. [[By only rewarding
those who are able-bodied, capitalism feeds into ableism. It produces
and then exacerbates inequalities between the "normal bodies" and those
who are disabled]{.mark}. It seems [obvious a system that relies on the
exploitation of individuals would in turn enable the devaluing of
disabled people because they may require more accommodations and aren't
as easily exploited]{.mark}.]{.underline} During the pandemic, it's also
become obvious that accessibility is possible. Remote work is possible.
But until a global pandemic struck, our capitalist society has not
considered it a possibility --- even for disabled people who could
greatly benefit from these accommodations. It certainly makes one thing
very clear: capitalism deems disabled people unworthy of the time and
effort it takes to dismantle the barriers it is responsible for. If we
able-bodied people want to be allies for those who are disabled, we need
to take on an anti-capitalistic lens. You can't separate the two. [[If
you want to fight ableism, you must be able to recognize that it is, and
has been for a long time, rooted in capitalism.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Crip technoscience centers the work of disabled people as knowers and
makers]{.underline}]{.mark}. Crip technoscience privileges disabled
people as designers and world-builders, as knowing what will work best
and developing the skills, capacities, and relationships to make
something from our knowledge. Unlike typical approaches to disability
that objectify disabled people and situate expertise in medical
professionals and non-disabled designers or engineers, crip
technoscience posits that disabled people are active participants in the
design of everyday life. Not only do disabled people make access in our
everyday lives in ways that do not get recognized as design, but the
lived experience of disability, and the shared experience of disability
community creates specific expertise and knowledge that informs
technoscientific practices.

[[We call for]{.mark} greater [acknowledgement of the lived experiences
and material design practices of disabled people in]{.mark} the work of
[technoscientific intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is a
widespread perception that access technologies are made for us by
non-disabled experts, but there is little recognition of our own
practices of remaking the material world. Yet the field of disability
scholarship grew out of activism against rehabilitative models of
medical expertise and intervention (UPIAS, 1976), crafting a materialist
politics with anti-capitalism at its center (Oliver, 1990; Russell,
1998), and continues to struggle against "compulsory ablebodiedness"
(McRuer, 2006). Crip knowing-making forms the basis of political slogans
such as Nothing About Us Without Us (Charlton, 2000), [[framing disabled
people not just as design experts but also as epistemic activists whose
politicized ways of knowing the material world also situate us to
produce the material conditions that allow disability to thrive]{.mark},
in addition to remaking how disability is known and
experienced.]{.underline} Without glorifying do-it-yourself design
practices, crip technoscience recognizes that disabled peoples'
world-dismantling and world-building labors stem from situated
experiences of "misfitting" in the world (Garland-Thomson, 2011). Crips
are not merely formed or acted on by the world---we are engaged agents
of remaking.

Critical disability studies and justice

The influence of CDS and its challenge to the assumption that disability
is a uniform condition have enabled the emergence of new ideas on
disability. In particular, this has enabled the development of a theory
that can take account of not only impairment effects but also can
include class, ethnicity, sexual orientation or cultural identities. It
has also argued for the re-emergence of a new political identity, one
where a solidarity that was previously built on a common single identity
is replaced by one that incorporates multiple voices including
representatives from across the range of constituencies. The politics
that it seeks to develop will be the ending of the single interest group
identity of the disability movement to be replaced by single-issue
groups campaigning for different social issues. To paraphrase Lister
(1998, 74), [[if disability and impairment are simply]{.mark} to be
'[deconstructed]{.mark} into a kaleidoscope of shifting identities' and
ableist discourses, **[there will be no disabled people left to]{.mark}
either [fight for the right to be]{.mark}, or to be [a
citizen.]{.mark}**]{.underline} If the principles of CDS are evaluated
critically in the light of disadvantage, its analytical and political
value becomes questionable. Its relativism and its suggestions that
impairments are ethically and politically merely neutral differences are
false. [Impairments often have very tangible effects on people's
well-being]{.underline}, many of [which cannot be explained away by
deconstruction]{.underline} (for example, Shakespeare 2006; Thomas
1999). [[Recognizing impairment]{.mark} effects [is necessary]{.mark} in
order [to secure proper treatment and social arrangements]{.mark} that
enhance disabled people's well-being and social participation. CDS runs
the risk of dismissing]{.underline} not only the personal experiences of
living with impairment, but also [the significance of the differences
between socially created disadvantages.]{.underline} These
[[disadvantages]{.underline}]{.mark} that [often [result from
oppressive]{.mark} [social arrangements]{.mark}]{.underline}, are very
much real and take place in different ways for different disadvantaged
groups. [[Disabled people]{.mark} typically [experience disadvantage in
relation to the market]{.mark} and capitalism]{.underline}, and [[they
have to]{.mark} a large extent [been excluded]{.mark} [from
employment]{.mark} and from equal social participation]{.underline},
respect and wealth (Wolff and De-Shalit 2007, 26). On top of these
materialist disadvantages, disabled people are stigmatized as deviant
and undesirable, and also subordinated to various oppressive
hierarchical relations. [For [disabled people]{.mark} to achieve
participatory parity, they require more than recognition; **[they need
material help]{.mark}, targeted resource enhancement, and personal
enhancement**]{.underline} (Wolff and De-Shalit 2007). [Disability is
rooted in the economic structures of society and demands redistribution
of goods and wealth.]{.underline} In contrast to some other oppressed
groups, disabled people require more than the removal of barriers if
they are to achieve social justice. This extra help might be small --
for example, allowing a student with dyslexia extra time in an
examination -- through to complex interventions such as facilitated
communication, a job support worker or 24-hour personal assistance.
Whatever the size, it is an extra cost both to employers and to the
state. These are real needs and represent real differences. Without an
acceptance of these differences it is hard to see how we could move
forward. Whilst these 'real differences' can be presented as the result
of dominant ableist discourses where disabled people's needs are
regarded as extra cost, this does not solve the problem. [The problems
[disabled people]{.mark} face [require **more than ideological
change**]{.mark}, and ideological change is of little use if it does not
result in material change. [CDS **fails to account for the economic
basis of disability**]{.mark} and offers only the tools of
deconstruction and the abolishment of cultural hierarchies to eradicate
economic injustice. This]{.underline}, as Fraser (2000) has argued,
[would be possible in a society where there were no relatively
autonomous markets and the distribution of goods were regulated through
cultural values.]{.underline} In such a society, oppression based on
identity would translate perfectly into economic injustice and
maldistribution. [This is far from the current reality where
'marketization has pervaded all societies to some degree]{.underline},
at least partially decoupling economic mechanisms of distribution from
cultural patterns of value and prestige' (Fraser 2000, 111). Markets are
not controlled by nor are they subsidiary to culture; 'as a result they
generate economic inequalities that are not mere expressions of identity
hierarchies' (Fraser 2000, 111--112). The disadvantage related to
disability is to a great extent a matter of economic injustice, and
[before this injustice can be corrected we have to be able to identify
those individuals and social groups that have been disadvantaged by
social arrangements. Whilst this does create and foster categories and
binaries between groups of people, it also requires some sort of
categories to start with; namely, the various categories of
disadvantage.]{.underline} Both the social and physical mechanisms that
produce human diversity are real, and they produce tangible differences
that cannot be challenged, let alone abolished, merely by pointing out
the wanton nature of difference, and deconstructing the meanings
attached to disability. Changing the social conditions that disadvantage
and disable some people demands that the diverse, sometimes dualistic,
reality of social advantage and disadvantage between different groups of
people is recognized. This is exactly why group identities based on, for
example, impairment, gender, or sexuality have been invaluable tools in
the resistance against discrimination and oppression -- in the fight
against socially produced disadvantage. [[Confident]{.mark}, positive
[disability identity has enabled]{.mark} many disabled [people
to]{.mark} actively challenge the status quo that disadvantages them and
to [claim rights and]{.mark} power and [participation in]{.mark}
dominant [institutions]{.mark}.]{.underline} Being different from the
so-called normal majority is no longer considered to conflict with a
good life, equality and respect. Quite the opposite, [positive
realization of one's difference has been liberating and empowering to
many disabled people]{.underline} (Shakespeare 2006; Morris 1991). For a
radical and active disability movement to emerge and for disabled people
to take action on their own account, they have to see themselves as an
unfairly marginalized or disadvantaged constituency and a minority group
(Shakespeare and Watson 2001). [[The category disabled/ non-disabled is
a good abstraction that can **enable**]{.mark} **the development of
[communities of resistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and without it is
hard to see how these could develop. CDS is premised on the idea that
difference acts as a precursor to the normalizing of behaviour and a
requirement to treat people differently and, importantly, less
favourably. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that the
categories that are applied to disabled people create an unnecessary
divide between disabled and nondisabled people. You could equally make
the point that [[without]{.mark} these [categories we would not
know]{.mark} what it is we have to do, [what actions]{.mark} we have to
take [or what services]{.mark} we have to put in place to include
disabled people.]{.underline} Indeed, [for many disabled people the
disadvantages they are subjected to arise not as the result of
domination but through neglect and the denial of services and through
society failing to take responsibility for those in need.]{.underline}
As Wolff (2009, 114) points out: 'anti-discrimination policy needs to
identify a group to be protected.' In other words, [it is impossible to
fight the oppression of a group of people that does not
exist.]{.underline} Recognition of impairment is also crucial regarding
legislation and policy that aim to protect disabled people against
discrimination. [The point of anti-discrimination legislation is to
protect people from discrimination on the basis of their physical and
mental properties, not on their opportunity to achieve equal
participation and respect.]{.underline} Thus, 'the parallel to race and
gender is not disability but impairment' (Wolff 2009, 135).

As I am making the final revisions on this paper, I have been
experiencing partial deafness for over a year, related to an untreated
inner ear infection which will now result in permanent hearing loss. I
did not attend to it sooner---it was not urgent, and time and energy are
so scarce. They have been made even more so this year as my son has not
been attending school full-time: some weeks he won't go for more than
two or three half days. The recent neoliberal cuts to public services in
the province of Québec---where I reside---have translated into losses
here and there, from removal of school transportation services to cuts
in hours of specialized education, effectively reducing the amount of
time an autistic child can spend at school. It is now late at night, and
I write these lines on an old and very slow netbook as my computer broke
down: when I bought it I had very limited financial resources, so I got
a cheap model with no guarantee. I could have had it fixed sooner,
instead I was striving to pass my PhD comprehensive examination these

Academia, **[[care]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and resilience

One of the ways in which liberal and neoliberal versions of independence
and needs are most debilitating is through the idea of resilience.
Resilience is often used as a term to celebrate the ongoing efforts of
those who continue to perform despite difficulties and struggles related
to their particular circumstances (see Jackson et al. 2007). When
thinking in terms of care, the idea of resilience is problematic
because, as Cindy Katz points out, social reproduction, almost by
definition, must be accomplished (Katz 2001). No matter how difficult
our circumstances or how bare our resources get, we, and the persons we
care for, need to eat, sleep, be clothed, warmed, and loved, at least at
a minimal level, in order to go on. Thus people will go to great lengths
(of resilience) to perform care. Resilience, therefore, cannot be taken
as an indicator that people are thriving despite the obstacles they
encounter, despite the inhumane and unjust expectations they face,
particularly in this moment of increasingly harsh neoliberalism (Diprose
2015). Resilience is in fact incredibly stressful. Beyond the financial
and logistical stress associated with both pursuing an academic path and
caring for others, being resilient implies sustaining the ever
underlying stress of feeling that one is never adequately filling their
own needs and those of their dependents.

In this context, resilience implies a projection into the future perfect
(see Povinelli 2011 for a discussion on tenses in late liberal
capitalist economies). It is the idea that there will be a future moment
when the unsustainability of (poor) caring practices will abate. "When
this article is written, this presentation done, this chapter
completed---these hardships that I am inflicting on myself and the ones
I care for will be over, and it will all have been worth it." Except
that this moment never comes. Within an increasingly competitive
academic context, demands are ever emerging and there is no final moment
of grace. As I am writing these lines, everyone in my house is finally
fed, bathed, asleep, and I have made it through another day. It is an
exhausting victory, yet nothing has been achieved that will not have to
be recommenced tomorrow. I have made it through another day, yet the
days of 'another day' are endless.

As problematic as it is, however, there are not many alternatives to
being resilient, to reconcile as well as we can the ever emerging needs
of existence and caring with the expectations for independent and
competitive accomplishments, while waiting for an ever elusive future
perfect. Resilience is indeed fuelled by the fear of breaking down, or,
of falling behind.

Centering our vision of productive contributions as engagements of
atomic and individuated individuals fosters a logic of "if you can't
take the heat, you had better get out of the kitchen." In that context,
asking for help is complicated or hindered by the apprehension that
responses, even from compassionate and concerned peers and superiors,
will be grounded in that logic: "It might be better for you to stop or
take a break at this point," or "Maybe later when your circumstances are
better...". This, however, is not going to happen; these circumstances
will not get better, because once again they are not a punctual and
discrete appendage of a self---or a cohort---that can be circumscribed
or cut out. They are embedded in one's very subjectivity, relationships,
and existence.

Meanwhile the ways we care for one another within the context of
academia are grounded in the dominant logic of independence and
resilience. Our paths as academics are tightly woven in an institution
fuelled by individualism and its correlate ideal of independence, and
the ways in which we care for one another most often fail to radically
challenge this, and to acknowledge the infinity and relationality of our
needs. Caring others---people who care about struggling individuals,
about inequalities in general---will attempt to facilitate academic
paths, but often their actions are limited to more or less punctual
accommodations, such as being a sympathetic listener, providing tissues
in which to cry, and granting extensions. This entails, for the person
receiving this type of support, the stress of navigating academic life
through often last minute actions of generosity that are entirely
dependent on the good will of others, and of knowing that this path of
navigation is unsustainable. In my case it also entails a dissonant
feeling of gratitude for this generosity and trust---it somehow entails
being in the position where I am genuinely grateful for being allowed to
continue maintaining my own existence and that of those who depend on
me.

Punctual acts of generosity and trust are also costly for those who
bestow them. Unsurprisingly in a liberal institution, and particularly
in these neoliberal times, the burden of it rests on individuals. In
addition to the logistical complications that supporting struggling
individuals can entail, there is also the anxiety and dangers of
venturing out of the current academic logic of individualism and
competition. Watching struggling individuals struggle, and attempting to
care for them, generates strain---I have seen it in the faces of
compassionate peers and professors, I have felt it in my face when
confronted by the needs of struggling peers. There again, future perfect
is often our false and cold comfort: "I know it's hard, but just get
this thing done, give a good hard push this time around, and then it'll
be done".

**[[Caring]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, [[is necessary]{.mark} as a
way [to **escape**]{.mark} the debilitating effects of]{.underline}
liberal and [[neoliberal paradigms of]{.underline}]{.mark} individualism
and **[[competition in the academy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [On every
university campus there are officially designated **places of
care**]{.underline}. **[Although necessary]{.underline}**, [these
services tend to respond to punctual and neatly delineated needs---such
as discrete episodes of illness or mental distress]{.underline}.
[**[But]{.underline}** [the **type** of caring that
**truly**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[facilitates]{.underline}]{.mark}** my
**[[existence]{.underline}]{.mark}** [is one that does not seek out the
independent and functional person]{.underline} within the grounded,
slow, and encumbered mess that I am. **[Places of care]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} indeed those [places that resist this sort
of]{.underline} surgical [violence.]{.underline}

In my institution one such place is found at a centre offering services
for students who are older women and/or women with children. [There, one
can find a free meal, a bed to rest on, companionship, or
silence]{.underline}. The centre is open everyday, to anyone, as the
needs it addresses are understood to be universal, rather than punctual
traits or shortcomings of a subjectivity that is dysfunctional in one
(or a few) specific ways. Where needs are not failures, one does not
have to identify as such. And so every moment spent in this place of
care preserves for a little while longer the possibilities of my
sustained presence in the academia---the possibilities of an alternative
social project (see Povinelli 2011).

Although it may seem unsatisfactory and insufficient, [maintaining
**possibilities** in the face of exhaustion is
**critical**]{.underline}---it is the basis of everything, including
change (Katz 2001; Povinelli 2011). [The **type of caring** that
**sustains** my **continued existence** as an academic [implies
inserting]{.mark} a logic of **[relationality]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[responsibility]{.underline}**, [[and]{.underline}
**[inter-dependency]{.underline}**]{.mark} within a structure grounded
on individualism and independence---it implies inserting a transgressive
current within an institution which doesn't have the eyes to recognize
it. Caring, then, is very much like Certeau's perruque (Certeau 1991): a
wig made from scrap material by a factory worker, who opportunistically
appropriates glimpses of company resources to create something unseen
and unforeseen by the power in place---to serve a subversive purpose.
Like making a wig, caring within the academy is a creative
diversion---of time, of attention, of affection, of academic positions
designed to foster individual achievements and competition. It is a wink
of recognition to other meanings within a totalizing space. It is an act
of resistance.

and Ono", Philosophy & Rhetoric, Volume 32, Number 1, p. 96-101

[My [concern]{.mark}]{.underline} with this movement [[centers
around]{.mark} an issue that]{.underline} Sloop and Ono [seem to take as
a given, namely, [the **role of the critic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On
one hand, calling for the systematic investigation of existing
marginalized discourses is a natural extension both of critical rhetoric
(see McKerrow 1989, 1991) and of the general ideological turn in
criticism (see Wander 1983). On the other hand, [the ease of transition
from criticism in the service of resistance to criticism of resistance
may obscure the need to address some fundamental issues regarding the
general function of rhetorical criticism in an uncertain and contentious
world]{.underline}. Beyond [licensing the critic to engage in political
struggle]{.underline}, Sloop and Ono advocate the pursuit of covert
resistant discourses.

Such a move not [only stretches our understanding of rhetoric and
criticism, but also alters significantly the relationship between critic
and out- law. Critical interrogation of dominant discursive practices in
the service of political/cultural reform is supplanted in favor of
[positioning]{.mark} covert out- law [communities as **objects of
investigation**]{.mark}. Invited to seek out subversive discourses,
[**the critic** is]{.mark} positioned as [the **active agent of change**
and]{.mark} the out-law [discourse becomes]{.mark} **merely
[instrumental]{.mark}**. Rather than academic criticism acting in
service of everyday acts of resistance, everyday acts of resistance are
put into the service of academic criticism.]{.underline}

Rhetorical resistance

That we are \"caught within conflicting logics of justice that are
culturally struggled over\" (Sloop and Ono 1997, 50) and that rhetoric
is employed in these struggles seems an uncontroversial statement.
Despite the theoretical miasma surrounding judgment, Sloop and Ono
accurately note, the material process of rendering judgments (and of
disputing the logics of litigation) continues in the world of actually
practiced discourse. In the materially contested world, rhetoric is
utilized both by those seeking to secure the grounds of dominant
judgment and by those seeking to undermine or supplant dominant cultural
logics with some out-law notion of justice.

The distinction between these two cultural groups, \"in-law\" and out-
law, however, deserves some consideration prior to any discussion of the
role of the critic as implied in the out-law discourse project. The
discourse of the dominant or those within the bounds of superordinate
logics of litigation is reminiscent of Michel De Certeau\'s (1984)
strategic discourse. For De Certeau, strategies are utilized by those
who have authority by virtue of their proper position. Strategies
exploit the institutionally guaranteed background consensus by which
power relations (and litigations) are maintained and advanced. In
contrast, tactics are utilized by those having no proper place of
authority within the discursive economy who must seek opportunities
whereby the discourse of the dominant might be undermined and contested.
To extend Sloop and Ono\'s definition, out-law discourses are those that
can (and, by their analysis, do) take advantage of situations (e.g.,
race riots) to disrupt the regularity of dominant cultural groups.

The ongoing struggle between strategically instituted cultural dominants
and the \"out-law always lurk\[ing\] in the distance\" (66) is
acknowledged, even celebrated, by Sloop and Ono. What their
acknowledgment fails to provide, however, is a clear need for critical
intervention. Indeed, quite the reverse is presented: It is the critic
(particularly the left-leaning critic) who needs out-law discourse.
While the struggles over justice, equality, and freedom have gone on,
the left-leaning critics are those who have theoretically excluded
themselves from the disputes. The study of out-law dis- courses, then,
provides a means to reinvigorate the intellectual and re-institute
(academic) leftist thinking into popular political struggles (53-54).
Thus, Sloop and Ono\'s project incorporates three types of rhetoric: the
rhetoric of the in-law, presumably the traditional object of critical
attention; the rhetoric of the out-law, the study of which may transform
our understanding of judgment as well as reinvigorate leftist democratic
critiques; and the rhetoric of the critics who, having lost their
political po- tency, can exploit the discourse of the out-law to promote
ideological struggles. It is to this critical rhetoric that I now turn.

Resistance criticism

Sloop and Ono (1997) clearly state the relationship they envision
between the rhetorical critic and out-law discourse: \"Ultimately, we
will argue that the role of critical rhetoricians is to produce
\'materialist conceptions of judgment,\' using out-law judgments to
disrupt dominant logics of judgment\" (54; emphasis added). Here the
critic seeks out vernacular discourse (60), focuses on the methods and
values embodied in these communities (62), listens to and evaluates the
out-law community (62-63), and chooses appropriate discourses for the
purpose of disrupting dominant practices (63). Essentially, it is the
critic who seeks out marginalized discourses and returns them to the
center for the purpose of provoking dominant cultural groups (63).

Despite acknowledging the efficacy of out-law discourses, Sloop and Ono
assume that the critiques generated and presented by the out-law
community have only minimal effect. The irony, and indeed arrogance, of
this assumption is evident when they claim: \"There are cases, however,
when, without the prompting of academic critics, out-law discourses
serve local purposes at times and at others resonate within dominant
discourses, disrupting sedimented ways of thinking, transforming
dominant forms of judgment\" (60; emphasis added). Sloop and Ono seem to
suggest that such locally generated critiques are the exception, whereas
the political efficacy of the academic critic is the rule. This seems an
odd claim, given that the justification for their out-law discourse
project is the lack of politically viable academic critique and the
perceived potency of out-law conceptions of judgment. [[Their suggestion
that out-law communities]{.mark} are in [need]{.mark} of [the academic
critic **contradicts**]{.mark}]{.underline} not only [[the]{.mark}
already [disruptive nature]{.mark} of existing out-law
discourses]{.underline} (the grounds for using out-law discourse), but
also the impotence of contemporary critical discourse (the warrant for
studying out-law discourse).

By this I do not mean that the critiques and theories generated by
academically instituted intellectuals have not been incorporated into
subversive discourses. Just as out-law discourses inevitably mount
critiques of dominant logics, so, too, the perspectives on rhetoric and
criticism generated by academics are used in resistance movements.
Feminist critiques of patriarchy, queer theories of homophobia,
postcolonial interrogations of race have found their way into the
service of resistant groups. The key distinction I wish to make is that
the existence of criticism (academic or self-generated) in resistance
does not necessitate Sloop and Ono\'s move to a criticism of resistance.

What [Sloop and [Ono fail to offer]{.mark}]{.underline} is [[an adequate
argument for \"**taking**]{.mark} **public [speaking out of the
streets]{.mark}** [and **studying it in the classroom**]{.mark}, for
[treating it less as]{.mark} an **expression of
[protest]{.mark}**[\"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wander 1983, 3)
[[and]{.mark} more [as an **object for analysis**]{.mark} and
**reproduction** [within the]{.mark} **political economy of the
[academy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Philip Wander made a similar charge
against Herbert Wicheln\'s early critical project, and this concern
should remain at the forefront of any discussion aimed at expanding the
scope and function of criticism. [Sloop and Ono offer numerous
directives for the critic [without addressing **whether the critic
should be examining**]{.mark} **out-law discourses [in the first
place]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While it is too early to suggest any
definitive answer to the question of criticism of resistance, some
preliminary arguments as to why critics should not pursue out-law
discourses can be offered:

\(1\) [Hidden out-law discourses may have **good reasons to stay
hidden**]{.underline}. Sloop and Ono specifically instruct us that \"the
logic of the out-law must constantly be searched for, brought forth\"
(66) and used to disrupt dominant practices. But [[are we to
believe]{.mark} that]{.underline} all out-law discourses are prepared to
mount such a challenge to the dominant cultural logic? Or, indeed, that
the [[members]{.mark} of out-law communities [are prepared to be
**brought into the arena of**]{.mark} **public
[surveillance]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the service of reconstituting
logics of litigation? It seems highly unlikely that all divergent
cultural groups have developed equally, or that all members of these
groups share Sloop and Ono\'s \"imperial impulse\" (51) to promote their
conceptions and practices of justice.

\(2\) Academic critical discourse is not transparent. Here I allude to
the overall problem of translation (see Foucault 1994; Lyotard 1988;
Lyotard and Thebaud 1985; Zabus 1995) as an extension of the previous
concern. Critical discourse cannot become the medium of commensurability
for divergent language games. Are we to believe that the \"use\" of
out-law dis- course by critics to disrupt dominant practices can fail to
do violence to these diverse/divergent logics? Are out-law discourses
merely tools to be exploited and discarded in the pursuit of returning
leftist academic dis- course to the center?

\(3\) Perhaps the academic translation of out-law discourse could be
true to the internal logic of the out-law community. And,
[[perhaps]{.mark} the [re-presentation]{.mark} of out-law logic within
the academic community [will bestow]{.mark} a degree of
**[legitimacy]{.mark}** on the out-law community. [**Nonetheless**, the
effect]{.mark} of legitimizing out-law discourse [is]{.mark} unknown and
potentially **[destructive]{.mark}**. In an effort [to
**siphon**]{.mark} **the political [energy]{.mark}** of out-law
discourse [into academic practice, we]{.mark} may ultimately
**[destroy]{.mark}** the dissatisfaction that serves as [a
**cathexis**]{.mark} for these out-law discourses]{.underline}. It seems
possible that [academic [recognition]{.mark} might [**take the place**
of]{.mark} struggle for [material opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline}
(see Fraser 1997). [[But, will]{.mark} academic [legitimation create
**any**]{.mark} **material [changes]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the
[conditions]{.mark} of out-law communities?]{.underline} I mean to
suggest, not that it is better to allow the out-law community to suffer
for its cause, but rather that incorporating the struggle into an
(admittedly) impotent academic critique does not offer a prima facie
alternative.

\(4\) Criticism of resistance denies the practical and theoretical
importance of opportunity. Returning to De Certeau\'s notion of tactics,
the crucial element of these discursive moves is their use of
opportunity to disrupt the proper authority of the dominant. The kairos
of intervention provides the key to undermining \"in-law\" discourses.
But when is the \"right moment in time\" for the academic reproduction
of out-law discourse? Mapping the points of resistance (ala Foucault and
Biesecker) entails interrogating \"in-law\" discourses for their
incongruities and contradictions, not turning the academic gaze upon
those communities waiting for an opportunity. Out-laws do not lurk in
the forefront (66), hoping to be exposed by academic critics; they wait
for the right moment for their disruption. Rhetoricians can provide
rhetorical instructions for seeking opportunities and for exploiting
these opportunities (literally making the culturally weaker argument the
stronger), but this does not justify interrogating (intervening in) the
cultural logics of the marginalized.

The concerns raised here are not designed to dismiss Sloop and Ono\'s
provocative essay. The divergent critical logic they outline deserves
careful consideration within the critical community, and it is my hope
that the concerns I raise may help to further problematize the
relationship between

resistance and rhetorical criticism.

Rhetorical criticism

As I have suggested, my purpose is to use the provocative nature of
Sloop and Ono\'s project to extend disputes regarding the ends of
rhetorical criticism. Diverging perspectives on the ends of criticism
have been categorized by Barbara Warnick (1992) as falling along four
general lines: artist, analyst, audience, and advocate. Leah Ceccarelli
(1997) discerns similar categories around the aesthetic, epistemic, and
political ends of rhetorical criticism.

The out-law discourse project presents clear ties to the notion of
critic as advocate. [For Sloop and Ono, the critic is an **interested
party**, discerning]{.underline} (and at times disputing) [the
underlying values and forces contained within a discourse. Additionally,
however, [the]{.mark} out-law discourse [critic is]{.mark} an analyst
[focusing on]{.mark} the **[hidden]{.mark}**]{.underline}, aberrant
[[texts]{.underline}]{.mark} of the out-law [[and
**\"rendering\]**]{.mark} **an incoherent or esoteric text
[comprehensible\"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Warnick 1992, 233). Now, I am
not suggesting that a critic must serve only one function or that the
roles of advocate and analyst are mutually exclusive; rather, [these
entanglings of power]{.underline} (political ends) [and
knowledge]{.underline} (epistemic ends) [are inevitable]{.underline}. My
concern is that we not neglect the complexity of these entanglements.
**[[Turning covert]{.mark} out-law [discourses into objects of]{.mark}
our [analyses]{.mark} runs the [risk]{.mark} of [subjecting them]{.mark}
both [to the gaze of the dominant and]{.mark} to [the power relations of
the academy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As the works of Michel Foucault
(especially 1979, 1980) aptly illustrate, practices presented as
extending such noble goals as emancipation and humanity may endow
institutions of confinement and objectification. Any justification for
studying out-law dis- course because doing so may extend our political
usefulness in the pursuit of emancipatory goals must not obscure the
already existing power relations authorizing such studies. Our attempts
to extend our domains of knowledge and expertise (authority) must not be
pursued unreflexively.

Finally, [because **[care can be mobilized]{.mark} as a way [to
privilege some groups at the expense of others, the "radical" aspect of
care]{.mark} [can bleed into right-wing and white supremacist
politics]{.mark}** as much as it upholds leftist utopian
visions]{.underline}. In describing her current book project on machine
learning and segregation, Discriminating Data: Neighborhoods,
Individuals, Proxies, media theorist Wendy Hui Kyong Chun argues that
social networking platforms rely on a logic of homophily: birds of a
feather flock together, so you will want to date, love, and be
neighborly with those who are just like you, who share your fundamental
values and interests.33 [**[The]{.mark} [problem with care]{.mark}**
attached to fellow feeling or sympathy **[is]{.mark} that** all too
often it means that **[care is reserved for those deemed
worthy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Cotten Seiler's article in this issue
underscores, **[[radical care is]{.underline}]{.mark}** also potentially
**[[dangerous]{.mark}: affective feelings of [compassion and

despite the state-backed care offered by the New Deal. **[What happens

subsequent charitable action? [Care is unevenly distributed and *cannot

commercialized co-optation of neoliberal self-care we describe above,
[political leaders also take advantage of stereotypes about caregiving
to extract unpaid labor from citizens.]{.underline} Care is a collective
capacity to build an alternative to colonialism and capitalism, **[[but
those in power]{.underline}]{.mark}** can also **[[instrumentalize
empathy and care to their own ends]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For example,
Andrea Muehlebach has shown how the post-Fordist Italian state valorizes
**[[and]{.mark} [manipulates compassion]{.mark} in order to absolve
itself of responsibility to its most marginalized
citizens]{.underline}**.34 [In]{.underline} the context of [[the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, the
American health [care]{.underline} and childcare [[systems]{.mark} are
kept afloat by a vast corpus of [unpaid or devalued]{.mark} domestic
work performed by [poor immigrant women and kin
members]{.mark}]{.underline}.35 [[Domestic]{.mark} [workers]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} some of the most [exploited]{.mark} workers]{.underline},
not just in the United States but [[globally]{.mark};]{.underline} in
Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Bangladesh they are [often poor migrant
women]{.underline} and [are [without labor unions or other
protections]{.mark}, often subjected to sexual assault and other forms
of violence]{.underline}.36 To be clear, the problems that radical care
seeks to remedy are not just a product of neoliberal policy or the
election of Donald Trump and other authoritarian leaders. Older
histories of settler colonialism and centuries of exploitation inform
the inequalities entangled with care today. As Leanne Betasamosake
Simpson and Dionne Brand put it, **["The monster has arrived, and the

Philosopher Anna Carastathis (2013) recuperates one of Crenshaw's early
metaphors in order to illustrate this point. Crenshaw's (1989) metaphor
of a basement with a trap door illustrates how [[single-axis or
limited-axis movements]{.mark} may [fail people facing multiple systems
of oppression]{.mark}.]{.underline} By system of oppression, I mean
[[historical and institutionalized patterns that disadvantage a
particular group]{.mark} of people based on their social
identity]{.underline}. Systems of oppression include racism, sexism,
heterosexism, ableism and so forth. [In the 'basement' metaphor, 'all
people who are disadvantaged on the basis of race, sex, class, sexual
preference, age, and/or physical ability' occupy a basement with 'those
on the bottom being disadvantaged by the full array of factors, up to
the very top, where the heads of those disadvantaged by a singular
factor brush up against the ceiling']{.underline} (Crenshaw 1989, 151).
In Crenshaw's initial work on intersectionality, which examined why
Black women facing discrimination did not have legal recourse, White
women and Black men could say they would be out of the basement 'but
for' the ceiling. However, Black women faced two 'but fors' -- racism
and sexism -- and became legally invisible. [[Truly intersectional work
aims to address all]{.mark} of the [systems of oppression]{.mark} that
might leave someone in the metaphorical basement]{.underline}. The
'Applications: [[bringing intersectionality and disability justice to EJ

that oppresses people with nonnormative bodies and minds.

Analytical strategy for explanation: [deepening understanding of

**[[enhances the capacity for explaining a

Differential exposure and vulnerability -- the traffic crash
[Exposure]{.underline}. [[People with disabilities are specifically
exposed]{.mark} to]{.underline} and vulnerable to [environmental
injustice]{.underline} **[[as a result of
ableism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Just as people occupying marginalized
race and class positions are geographically segregated, so are [people
with disabilities more likely than those without to be geographically
segregated]{.underline}, unemployed or underemployed, and poor (Russell
1998; Hemingway and Priestley 2006). This makes people with disabilities
more likely to live in areas with disproportionate burden of
environmental bads, such as near current or legacy factory sites.
Moreover, those most likely to be subject to and bear the greatest
burdens of environmental injustice often occupy multiple marginalized
social locations. Scholars have demonstrated this with respect to
disability, gender and race in the case of Hurricane Katrina. [Hurricane
[Katrina]{.mark}]{.underline}, established in the academic literature as
an issue of EJ (Sze 2006), climate justice (Schlosberg and Collins 2014)
and racial justice (Elliott and Pais 2006), [[illustrates how disability
status contributed to the lived experiences]{.underline}]{.mark} of
people in New Orleans, and why Hurricane Katrina also [presented issues
of disability justice]{.underline} (Finger 2005; NCD 2005). Public
health researchers found that those, who did not evacuate 'lacked public
transportation, misjudged the storm, were limited by their own or a
family member's physical disability, and were more likely to be lifetime
New Orleans residents' (Brodie et al. 2006, 1407). Among those who were
evacuated, 27,000 people moved from the Superdome in New Orleans to the
Astrodome in Houston, Texas. Some of the arrivals had lost their
mobility devices and, until donated wheelchairs arrived, had difficultly
accessing the restrooms in the large arena, while other arrivals who see
and hear with different strategies than typically seeing and hearing
people had to adapt to the new environment until accessibility was
addressed after several days (Bloodworth et al. 2007). Lack of access to
disability-aware spaces and underestimation of disability-specific
supplies meant that evacuees were further harmed even after leaving the
hurricane area. Evacuation exacerbated previous chronic health
conditions as well given the extent to which lowincome people relied on
public hospitals decimated by the storm (Brodie et al. 2006). [**[A
disability justice framework understands that it is not people with
disabilities who are 'unprepared']{.underline}** [but
rather]{.underline}]{.mark} [ableism that has contributed to [a larger
system that has failed them]{.mark} and their families]{.underline}
(Fenney Salkeld 2016; Kim 2016, 198--212). Likewise, Hurricane Katrina
created conditions for further disablement. For example, demographer
Narayan Sastry and economist Jesse Gregory (2013) explicitly focus on
disability as an 'effect' of Hurricane Katrina -- making disability the
dependent variable and accounting for age, race and sex as independent
variables. Their analysis of data from the American Community Survey
revealed that the increase in disability in New Orleans was
disproportionately concentrated among young and middle-aged Black women,
with the young faring the worst. Sastry and Gregory draw on the extant
literature to review the potential factors contributing to multiple
marginalization -- [young black women were caught at the intersection of
race, gender and age in such a way that adverse outcomes
compounded]{.underline}. As [Black people]{.underline}, they [were more
likely to live in dwellings and communities that suffered the most
damage, leading to loss of property and neighborhood ties. As women,
they were more likely to be left with children after households broke
up, and the difficulties children in their care faced post-hurricane may
have been sources of stress and consequent mental health
effects.]{.underline} As young people, new mental and physical
impairments were more 6 C. JAMPEL Downloaded by \[66.189.72.133\] at

their effects on ability to work, having younger children not as easily
able to help with daily tasks such as shopping, and more limited access
to financial resources. In their explanation, the researchers imply a
contextual model of disablement as a result of historical processes.

#### Environmental impacts are uniquely magnified against disabled bodies -- only a critical intersectional lens towards political processes can identify vulnerability

Vulnerability. [[People whose bodies diverge from the 'normal']{.mark}
or 'standard']{.underline} may [[face greater exposure]{.mark} [to
environmental injustice]{.mark}]{.underline} than other people. For some
people, their bodily differences may also make them especially
vulnerable to the effects of certain environmentally unjust conditions.
[For example, [people who are immunosuppressed]{.mark}]{.underline} or
have biological variations such as 'slow acetylation' [[bear a greater
burden when exposed to **air pollution, pesticides, industrial
chemicals**]{.underline}]{.mark} and a host of other toxic trespasses, a
phrase Sandra Steingraber (2010, 279) uses to describe involuntary human
exposure to a pollutant. As she explains, people who are slow
acetylators have low levels of the enzymes that detoxify aromatic
amines, a class of organic compounds used in pesticides and strongly
associated with bladder cancer (2010, 268). [Slow(er) acetylation
becomes a disability]{.underline} when high level of aromatic amine
exposure is part of society and culture. **[Biological variation
compounded with racialized, classed and gendered exposures to toxics
demonstrates how [disability status ends up being created and then
exacerbated through a political-- economic
context]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As mainstream discourses shape an
understanding through which the most 'vulnerable populations' are
'expected' to be further impaired or harmed (Fjord 2007), a **[[critical
and intersectional EJ lens can direct attention toward the political
processes]{.underline}]{.mark}** th[at lead to unnecessary occupational

technical aspects of design---such as input--output relations and

[**[an analysis of the normative choices]{.underline}**]{.mark} that go

reflecting on values woven into targets like 'fit,' one can parse out
legitimate indicators of employability, such as word choice, from ones

**[[mechanisms for combatting bias and promoting social

to situate algorithms in a socio-technical context and raise the
question of whether algorithms are appropriate instruments to measure
and shape certain domains in the first place. For instance, given
concerns about algorithms' ability to capture shifting, contextual
aspects of disability, what amount of discretion should they have over
disabled people's hiring outcomes, if any? While simply omitting groups
from algorithmic models would exacerbate inequality, there may be reason
to be much more skeptical of their inferences. Already, **[p[rotests by

(Wakabayashi & Shane,

**[[point to the ways in which data scientists can affect change beyond
the algorithm itself.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As such, **[[disability
justice indicates that we ought to expand the scope of AI ethics and
situate algorithms in their socio-technical
context.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Moreover, **[[a disability justice
approach suggests that data scientists should critically analyze the
ways in which disability is defined, measured, and
labelled.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Given that most data about disability
are medical, inferences from them typically are limited to the medical
model, reducing disability to a biological dysfunction. Yet, **[[by
drawing on disability scholarship]{.mark}, [we]{.mark}]{.underline}**
can **[[uncover]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[ways]{.underline}]{.mark}** in which **[[these categories shift and
trace their roots to ableist assumptions.]{.underline}]{.mark}** For
instance, consider proposals to increase the amount and quality of
disability data by drawing from people's electronic health records.
While well-intentioned, these efforts would further entrench the medical
model of disability, leave little room for self-identification, and
underrepresent disabled people who lack access to health care. Making
explicit the ways in which algorithms model disability creates space to
imagine it differently through methods like value-sensitive design
(Friedman & Hendry,
[2019](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR35);
Simon et al.,
[2020](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR92)).
Such an approach melds conceptual, empirical, and technical elements,
e.g., assessing models of disability in terms of their assumptions,
impact on data gathering, relationship to outcomes, and so on. In so
doing, data scientists could better attend to the ways that different
models influence people's claims about their disabilities and how those
claims are mediated by intersecting hierarchies of class, race, and
gender. By **[[investigating how different definitions and measures of
disability shape who 'counts' as disabled, data scientists can intervene
in these ongoing omissions. This requires altering how disabilities are
operationalized so they are defined not solely as medical diagnoses but
also in terms of how people navigate institutions, norms, and each
other.]{.mark}]{.underline}** While fair-ML idealizes abstraction so
that data can be applied across contexts, (in)capacities emerge from a
multitude of contextual factors like competing values and built
environments. Instead, a disability justice framework suggests that
**[[an algorithm's accuracy does not always trade off with its ability
to accommodate contingency because many disabilities are intrinsically
situational and resist quantification.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Implementing this approach might involve, e.g., assigning more weight to
contextual factors, assessing how aspects of a given disability shift
over time, and designing scales that are sensitive to social values and
attitudes. For example, some researchers have demonstrated that
disability data can be disaggregated to more easily study the variables
that cooccur with certain disabilities or contexts (Brown & Broido,
[2020](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR15);
Peña et al.,
[2018](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR77)).
Others have called for analyzing how people's capacities expand and
contract in relation to built accessibility, office culture, and the
type of labor at hand (Bennett et al.,
[2020](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR9)).
This suggests that data scientists could model disability differently by
altering processes of data collection, label generation, and proxy
selection so as not to abstract away its context. In addition,
disability justice demands more fundamental shifts in access,
communication, and ownership across the AI design pipeline. Indeed, the
biases that hiring algorithms exhibit are inseparable from developers'
sole focus on employer values and widening asymmetries between firms and
applicants. Although applicants' ability to secure jobs is shaped by
these AI, they cannot examine or offer input on them easily, if at all.
[**[Expanding opportunities for these engagements and removing barriers
to access is essential to designing more equitable
algorithms]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Already, initiatives like Access
Computing offer accessible training in computer science (Trewin et al.,
[2019](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR99))
and groups like (Dis)Ability in AI provide support to disabled people at
conferences about AI (Whittaker et al.,
[2019](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR104)).
Despite efforts to increase disability representation at design forums
and in training datasets, [**[the mere]{.underline}** **[presence of
disability is not enough to transform existing institutions and restore
trust.]{.underline}**]{.mark} That is, **[[vendors must design with
disabled people]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not merely for them. As the
scope of design expands, data scientists ought to draw insights from
other disciplines, including disability studies and socio-technical
design, and team up with a wider range of stakeholders. This process
cannot simply tack on these perspectives but must integrate and consult
with them throughout the design pipeline. By collaborating with a
diverse array of disciplines and voices, data scientists could better
identify stakeholders in AI hiring, explore their values and needs,
study how AI might implicate them, and involve them in design processes.
This bears similarities to a participatory design perspective, in which
workers are empowered by directly influencing the design of technologies
they will take up (Korsgaard et al.,
[2016](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR54)).
Using a variety of techniques---from prototyping and mock-ups to
future-oriented workshops and scenarios---stakeholders reflect on the
situation, imagine innovative solutions, and transform those speculative
approaches into realistic, concrete alternatives. This might involve, to
give an example, asking stakeholders to evaluate whether automated
interviews that assess affect and gestures align with their values, what
they communicate about disabled applicants, and how they might be
navigated. In parallel, insights from disability studies suggest
granting disabled people's perspectives significant weight in debates
about, e.g., generating labels and selecting proxies for disability
status. For instance, developers might look to data platform co-ops
operated by people with rare disabilities, in which they oversee the use
of their data and share profits (Scholz,
[2016](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR86);
Treviranus,
[2018](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR97)),
to inform their own decisions about responsible data use. By working
alongside these other disciplines and voices from the start of the
design process, data scientists could help bridge gaps in knowledge,
foster a common conceptual language, and develop new research methods.
**[[Beyond expanding]{.underline}]{.mark}** the scope of **[[AI ethics
concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}**, redefining design values, and changing
stakeholder dynamics, a **[[disability justice approach suggests
pursuing policy measures that can empower data activism.]{.mark} [While
legislation often lags behind advances in computing, existing regulatory
uncertainty allows AI vendors to selectively endorse transparency and
fairness criteria in ways that preserve existing arrangements. Greater
transparency could help promote the conditions necessary for activists
and data scientists alike to study, uncover, and contest algorithmic
bias.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Despite the explanatory difficulties
associated with the black box, **[[policies ought to be introduced
mandating that AI developers regularly audit and
disclose]{.mark}]{.underline}** the purview, inputs and outputs, and
**[[limitations of their algorithms.]{.underline}]{.mark}** For example,
some have suggested requiring employers to make public the automated
inferences they make about applicants (Hoffman,
[2019a](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR72))
and tasking them with retaining detailed records of their bias
mitigation procedures (Hoffman,
[2019b](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR71)).
**[[Developing legislation to establish minimum standards for data
transparency and disclosure of bias mitigation measures---even for
opaque machine learning AI---is necessary to identify and make claims
against discriminatory algorithms.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In addition to
setting baselines for transparent design and implementation,
**[[recognizing how ableist structures can affect people's
identification with and disclosure of disability status highlights the
importance of more robust privacy regulations.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Existing protections are ill-equipped to grapple with the ethical risks
posed by automated hiring tools or predictions of disability status. The
ADA (1990) only shields those who are disabled, treated as disabled, or
were disabled, while GINA (2008) and HIPAA (OCR,
[2021](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR73))
protect health data while it is being stored, transferred, and analyzed
by certain classes of covered entities. However, since these laws
neither cover AI vendors and data brokers nor explicitly forbid
discrimination based on inferred risk factors for disabilities, AI can
circumvent them (Givens & Morris,
[2020](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR38)).
Similarly, while the ADA prohibits discrimination in places of public
accommodation, it does not explicitly include algorithms, social media
platforms, and so on (Rothstein,
[2020](https://link-springer-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09633-2#ref-CR82)).
Expanding existing privacy protections would help make disability
disclosure less precarious and, in so doing, assist efforts to gather
more representative datasets.
