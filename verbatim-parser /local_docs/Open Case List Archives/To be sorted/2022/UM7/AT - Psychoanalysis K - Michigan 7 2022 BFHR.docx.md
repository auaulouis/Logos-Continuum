**[2ac death drive]{.underline}**

**There's no utility in embracing the death drive---it just reinforces
things that already suck**

**Robinson 5** \[Andrew, PhD in political theory at the University of
Nottingham, Theory and Event, 8/1, "The Political Theory of Constitutive
Lack: A Critique", projectmuse\]

Guattari\'s critique of psychoanalysis makes clear the myths which
underlie it.  \'Psychoanalysis transforms and deforms the unconscious by
forcing it to pass through the grid of its system of inscription and
representation.  For psychoanalysis, the unconscious is always already
there, genetically programmed, structured, and finalized on objectives
of conformity to social norms\'104.  Similarly, [R]{.underline}eich has
already exposed a predecessor of the idea of \"constitutive lack\" - the
Freudian \"death instinct\" - as a denial that \"I don\'t know\".  It
is, he says, a metaphysical attempt to explain as yet inexplicable
phenomena, an attempt which gets in the way of fact-finding about these
phenomena105.  He provides a detailed clinical rebuttal of the idea of
the \"death instinct\" which is equally apt as an attack on Lacanians
(who seem unaware of Reich\'s intervention).  In Reich\'s view, the
masochistic tendencies Freud associates with the \"death instinct\" are
secondary drives arising from anxiety, and are attributable to \'the
disastrous effect of social conditions on the biopsychic apparatus. 
This entailed the necessity of criticizing the social conditions which
created the neuroses - a necessity which the hypothesis of a biological
will to suffer had circumvented\'106.  [[The idea of the \"death
instinct\" leads to a]{.mark} cultural [philosophy in which suffering
is]{.mark} assumed to be [inevitable]{.mark},]{.underline} whereas
Reich\'s alternative - to attribute neurosis to frustrations with
origins in the social system - leads to a critical sociological
stance107.  The relevance of Reich\'s critique to the political theory
of constitutive lack is striking.  [[The \"death instinct\" is connected
to]{.mark} an idea of [primordial masochism]{.mark}]{.underline} which,
in the form of \"aphanisis\" or \"subjective destitution\", recurs
throughout Lacanian political theory.  [[Zizek]{.mark} in particular
[advocates masochism,]{.mark} in the guise of \"shooting at\" or
\"beating\" oneself, [as a radical gesture]{.mark} which reveals the
essence of the self and breaks the constraints of an oppressive
reality]{.underline}108, although the masochistic gesture is present in
all Lacanian theorists.  The death instinct is typified by Zizek as a
pathological (in the Kantian sense), contingent attitude which finds
satisfaction in the process of self-blockage109.  It is identical with
the Lacanian concept of jouissance or enjoyment.  For him, \'enjoyment
(jouissance) is not to be equated with pleasure: enjoyment is precisely
\"pleasure in unpleasure\"; it designates the paradoxical satisfaction
procured by a painful encounter with a Thing that perturbs the
equilibrium of the pleasure principle.  In other words, enjoyment is
located \"beyond the pleasure principle\"\'110.  It is also the core of
the self, since enjoyment is \'the only \"substance\" acknowledged by
psychoanalysis\', and \'the subject fully \"exists\" only through
enjoyment\'111.  Primordial masochism is therefore central to the
Lacanian concept of the Real, which depends on there being a universal
moment at which active desire - sometimes given the slightly misleading
name of the \"pleasure principle\" - is suspended, not for a greater or
delayed pleasure, but out of a direct desire for unpleasure (i.e. a
primary reactive desire).  Furthermore, this reactive desire is supposed
to be ontologically prior to active desire.  Dominick LaCapra offers a
similar but distinct critique to my own, claiming that Lacanian and
similar theories induce a post-traumatic compulsion repetition or an
\'endless, quasi-transcendental grieving that may be indistinguishable
from interminable melancholy\'112. Reich has already provided a rebuttal
of \"primordial masochism\", which, paradoxically given Zizek\'s claims
to radicalism, was denounced by orthodox Freudians as communist
propaganda.  In Reich\'s view, masochism operates as a relief at a
lesser pain which operates as armouring against anxiety about an
underlying trauma113.  Regardless of what one thinks of Reich\'s
specific account of the origins of masochism, [what is crucial is his
critique of the idea of a death drive. ]{.underline} \'Such hypotheses
as are criticised here are often only a sign of therapeutic failure. 
For [[if one explains masochism by a death instinct]{.mark}, [one
confirms to the patient his]{.mark} \[sic\] [alleged will to
suffer\']{.mark}]{.underline}[114]{.mark}.  [Thus, [Lacanian]{.mark}
[metaphysics conceal Lacanians\' encouragement of a variety of neurosis
**complicit with oppressive social realities**]{.mark}.  Politically,
[**the thesis of primordial masochism provides a mystifying cover** for
the social forces which cause and benefit from the contingent emergence
of masochistic attachments (i.e. sadistic power apparatuses).  One could
compare this remark to Butler\'s claim that Zizek \'defends the trauma
of the real\... over and against a different kind of
threat\']{.mark}]{.underline}115.

**Studies don't support death drive---replicable tests are impossible,
variables are too vague to operationalize**

**Holowchak 12** \[Andrew, teaches Philosophy at Rider University. When
Freud (Almost) Met Chaplin: The Science behind Freud\'s \"Especially
Simple, Transparent Case\" Project Muse\]

[The problem is]{.underline} that [psychoanalytic concepts]{.underline}
(e.g., \"super-ego,\" \"Oedipus complex,\" [and \"[death
drive]{.mark}\"]{.underline}30 ), unlike them of say physics
(\"electron,\" \[End Page 67\] \"muon,\" and \"quark\"), [[are logical
constructs that have not been corroborated by]{.underline} **[precise
observations]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and]{.underline} **[replicable
tests]{.underline}**. Hence Freud\'s logical constructs as
proto-concepts are not even adequate as working hypotheses. As early as
1934, J. F. Brown, who claimed he was in sympathy with Freud\'s new
science, urged, \"But, and here almost [all critics of psychoanalysis
are in agreement, the theory has never been precise enough to allow
formulation of working hypotheses for which adequate experimental
situations **could be found\"**]{.underline} (1933, p. 333). He went on
to acknowledge, perhaps somewhat prophetically, given the amount of
attention Freud gets today in philosophy of mind, \"Freud\'s discoveries
probably are the most striking and original contributions made to the
science of mind in our time.\" He added, in a manner that vitiates the
compliment, that Freud is more prophet than scientist---more Bruno than
Galileo (1933, p. 226).

Freud was aware of that. His own view of the concepts of psychoanalysis
is ambivalent. At times, he shows impatience and becomes intolerant of
his critics. \"Only in psychology \[is obscurity not tolerated\]; here
the constitutional incapacity of men for scientific research comes into
full view. It looks as though people did not expect from psychology
progress in knowledge, but some other kind of satisfaction; every
unsolved problem, every acknowledged uncertainty is turned into a ground
of complaint against it\" (1916--7, S.E., XXII: 6). At other times,
[Freud seems to agree with his critics.]{.underline} In
\"Autobiographical Study,\" when he mentions difficulties with
\"compulsion to repeat,\" [he adds]{.underline}:

[Although it arose from a [desire]{.mark} to fix some of the most
important theoretical ideas of psycho-analysis, it [goes far **beyond
psychoanalysis**]{.mark}. I have repeatedly heard it said contemptuously
that [it is impossible to take a science seriously **whose most general
concepts are as lacking in precision as those of libido and of
drive**]{.mark}]{.underline} in psychoanalysis.

(1925, S.E., XX: 57)

In \"Why War?,\" Freud writes to Einstein in a manner to explain his
ambivalence: \"It may perhaps seem to you \[Einstein\] as though our
theories are a kind of mythology and, in the present case, not even an
agreeable one. But does not every science come in the end to a kind of
mythology like this?\" (1933, S.E., XXII: 211)

In sum, [the [bedrock concepts of Freudian psychoanalysis are
conceptually indeterminate]{.mark}]{.underline}. That means that the
fundamental principles of Freudian psychoanalysis are conceptually
indeterminate and, [[thus]{.underline}, **[obscure or
meaningless]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Unfortunately, as we have seen,
Freud was evasive when it \[End Page 68\] came to the question of the
status of the bedrock concepts of psychoanalysis and even said that
psychoanalysis, with the exception of \"repression\" and
\"unconscious,\" could do just as well without them31 (1914, S.E., XIV:
16; 1925, S.E., XX: 32--3). [Without referents to the concepts he
employs so significantly, **[Freud is writing
gobbledygook]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[A related difficulty is conceptual change. [Freud]{.mark}, as a
scientist, [was committed to conceptual flexibility, insofar as his
postulates were avowedly data-driven]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nonetheless,
[many of the conceptual changes he made]{.underline}---e.g., his
rejection of his Seduction theory and [[his adoption of the death drive
and structural model]{.underline}---[were prompted more by theoretical
difficulties than they were driven by observational
data.]{.underline}]{.mark} In addition, [[Freud **surrounded himself**
with **lackeys**]{.mark}, albeit intelligent lackeys, that allowed him,
[**as founder** of psychoanalysis, the **privilege** of being final
arbiter on issues of **conceptual change** within
psychoanalysis.]{.mark}]{.underline}[32]{.mark}

**Affirming survival doesn't devalue life -- life is complex and
malleable and can be celebrated even when it seems oppressive**

**Fassin, 10** - James D. Wolfensohn Professor in the School of Social
Science at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, as well as
directeur d'études at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales,
Paris. (Didier, Fall, "Ethics of Survival: A Democratic Approach to the

Conclusion

[[Survival]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the sense Jacques Derrida attributed
to the concept in his last interview, not only shifts lines that are too
often hardened between biological and political lives: it
[**[opens]{.mark} an ethical [space for]{.mark}** **[reflection and
action]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Critical thinking in the past decade has
often taken biopolitics and the politics of life as its
objects]{.underline}. It has thus unveiled the way in which individuals
and groups, even entire nations, have been treated by powers, the
market, or the state, during the colonial period as well as in the
contemporary era.

[However, through indiscriminate extension, this powerful instrument has
lost some of its analytical sharpness and heuristic
potentiality]{.underline}. On the one hand, [[the]{.mark} binary
[reduction of life to the opposition between]{.mark} nature and history,
[bare life and qualified life]{.mark}]{.underline}, when systematically
applied from philosophical inquiry in sociological or anthropological
study, [[erases]{.mark} much of [the]{.mark} complexity and [richness of
life]{.mark} in society as it is in fact observed]{.underline}. On the
other hand[, the normative prejudices which underlie the evaluation of
the forms of life and of the politics of life, when generalized to an
undifferentiated collection of social facts, end up by depriving social
agents of legitimacy, voice, and action]{.underline}. The risk is
therefore both scholarly and political. It calls for ethical attention.

In fact, the genealogy of this intellectual lineage reminds us that the
main founders of these theories expressed tensions and hesitations in
their work, which was often more complex, if even sometimes more
obscure, than in its reduced and translated form in the humanities and
social sciences today. And also biographies, here limited to fragments
from South African lives that I have described and analyzed in more
detail [elsewhere, suggest the necessity of complicating the dualistic
models that oppose biological and political lives. Certainly, [powers
like the]{.mark} market and the [state]{.mark} do [act sometimes as if
human beings could be reduced to "mere life," but]{.mark} democratic
[forces]{.mark}, including from within the structure of power, [tend to
produce alternative]{.mark} [strategies that escape this
reduction]{.mark}]{.underline}. [And [people themselves, even under
conditions of domination]{.mark},]{.underline} \[End Page 93\] [[manage
subtle tactics that transform their]{.mark} physical [life]{.mark} [into
a]{.mark} political instrument or a [moral resource]{.mark} or an
affective expression]{.underline}.

But let us go one step further: ethnography invites us to reconsider
what life is or rather what human beings make of their lives, and
reciprocally how their lives permanently question what it is to be
human. "The blurring between what is human and what is not human shades
into the blurring over what is life and what is not life," writes Veena
Das. In the tracks of Wittgenstein and Cavell, she underscores that the
usual manner in which we think of forms of life "not only obscures the
mutual absorption of the natural and the social but also emphasizes form
at the expense of life."^22^ It should be the incessant effort of social
scientists to return to this inquiry about life in its multiple forms
but also in its everyday expression of the human.

Perhaps, then, [[what]{.underline}]{.mark} distant [[consumers express
when they sit glued]{.underline}]{.mark} to the television **[[watching
a disaster]{.underline}]{.mark}** replayed over and over, when they buy
t-shirts or snow globes, when they mail teddy bears to a memorial, or
when they tour a disaster site, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} a deep, maybe
**[subconscious, [longing for]{.mark} those age-old [forms of
community]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[real
human [compassion]{.mark}]{.underline}** [that emerge in a place when
disaster has struck. [It]{.mark} is a longing in some ways so alien to
the world we currently live in that it **[requires catastrophe to call
it forth]{.mark}**]{.underline}, even in our imaginations. Nevertheless,
[the actions of **unadulterated goodwill**]{.underline} [that become
commonplace]{.underline} in harrowing conditions [represent the **truly
authentic form of humanity**]{.underline} **[that all of
us]{.underline}**, to one degree or another, **[chase
after]{.underline}** in contemporary consumer culture every day. [And
while it is certainly a bit foolhardy to seek authentic humanity through
disaster-related]{.underline} [media]{.underline} and [culture,
**[the]{.mark} sheer [strength]{.mark} [of that desire has been evident
in the public's response to all]{.mark} the
[disasters]{.mark},**]{.underline} crises and catastrophes to hit the
United States in the past decade[. The millions of television viewers
who cried on September 11, or during Hurricane Katrina and the Virginia
Tech shootings, and the thousands upon thousands who volunteered their
time, labor, money, and even their blood, as well as the countless
others who created art, contributed to memorials, or adorned their cars
or bodies with disaster-related paraphernalia]{.underline}--- despite
the fact that many knew no one who had been personally affected by any
of these disasters---[all attest to a **desire for real human community
and compassion** that is woefully unfulfilled by American life under
normal conditions today]{.underline}. ¶ In the end, **[[the consumption
of disaster doesn't make us unable]{.mark} or unwilling [to engage
with]{.mark} [disasters]{.mark} on a communal level, or towards
progressive political ends]{.underline}**---it makes us feel as if we
already have, simply by consuming. [It is ultimately less a form of
political anesthesia than a simulation of politics]{.underline}, a
Potemkin village of communal sentiment, that fills our longing for a
more just and humane world with disparate acts of cathartic consumption.
Still, [the positive political potential underlying such
consumption---the desire for real forms of connection and
community---remains the most redeeming feature of disaster
consumerism.]{.underline} Though that desire is frequently warped when
various media lenses refract it, diffuse it, or reframe it to fit a
political agenda, [its overwhelming strength should nonetheless serve
notice that people want a different world than the one in which we
currently live, with a different way of understanding and responding to
disasters]{.underline}. They want a world where risk is not leveraged
for profit or political gain, but sensibly planned for with the needs of
all socio-economic groups in mind. **[[They want a world where]{.mark}
preemptive [strategies are used to anticipate]{.mark} the [real
threats]{.mark} posed by global climate change and global inequality,
[rather than to]{.mark} invent fears of ethnic others and [justify
unnecessary wars]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [They want a world where people
can come together **not simply as a market, but as a
public**]{.underline}, **[to exert real agency over the policies
made]{.underline}** in the name of their safety and security. And, [when
disaster does strike, they want a world where the goodwill and
compassion shown by their neighbors]{.underline}, by strangers in their
communities, [and even by distant spectators and consumers, will be
**matched by their own government**]{.underline}. **[Though this vision
of the world is utopian, it is not unreasonable]{.underline}**, and if
contemporary American culture is ever to give us more than just an
illusion of safety, or empathy, or authenticity, **[then it is this
vision that we must advocate on a daily basis, not only when disaster
strikes.]{.underline}**

**Psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience \-\--**

**1\-\--Belief in Authority**

MG)

**[Belief in Authority]{.underline}**

[Psychoanalysis is a "testimonial science" \[4\]; its theoretical
concepts rely on its major proponents\' clinical case interpretations.
However, the authority argument is **not sound** if the authors do not
have **sufficient proof about what they say**]{.underline}**.** Freud
did not make use of systematic and controlled scientific investigations
and not even statistics to achieve his conclusions \[9\], making it
imperative for the reader that consults the foundations of the theory to
trust that he possessed both different and special capabilities to find
out the truth about how human psychology works. However, [there are **no
reasons to believe** that a human being that resorts only on his
personal experience and decides not to use scientific tools would have
the means to formulate the most epistemically warranted psychological
theory. The other major psychoanalytic authors have also followed
Freud\'s steps. For one to believe in Lacan\'s discourse, for example,
it is necessary to first **take it as true and attribute him an
authority role**, since the reader has neither a way to verify its
claims independently, nor the resources to explicitly understand its
meanings]{.underline} \[10\]. Besides that, in the founder\'s case,
[reasons to take his narratives into consideration **might not even
exist**]{.underline}. When the topic is psychoanalysis, its proponents\'
honesty is an important aspect to be observed, precisely because the
theory is based on their authority \[4\]. [If there is no honesty, there
should not be any reasons, even for those unaware of the problems
related to anecdotal evidence, to continue adopting their
assumptions.]{.underline}

Dersken \[11\] demonstrates that [Freud frequently used a variety of
rhetorical strategies to avoid criticism and keep his theory\'s good
appearance in front of the]{.underline} public, and he succeeded. The
psychoanalyst affirmed several times that his theory did not consist of
speculation, in an attempt to convince his reader that a solid empirical
basis supported his conclusions, even while having none. [To deal with
the most severe counterarguments, he inverted the speech roles: Freud
himself presented objections to his own doctrine in the most threatening
way possible, and by doing so, it sounded like he was aware of the
problems and would know how to reply to them]{.underline}. What other
reason would he have to bring up all the criticism without knowing how
to defend his theory from it? [Even so, at the end of his discourse, the
supposed reply was **only evasive**, the original topic was altered,
**the burden of proof was inverted**, or absolutely no answer was given,
maintaining the original critiques still untouched]{.underline}.

Crews \[9\] argues that during several moments Freud adjusted his
narratives in order for them to fit in the result he previously aimed to
achieve, no matter if what he was saying was really true. [Many of his
clinical cases developed in ways that were distinct from what was
declared by him, went through a **biased interpretative process**, or
**did not obtain promising results**. Anna O. was not someone with
hysteria]{.underline}; in fact, she suffered from a chemical dependency
of substances like morphine and chloral hydrate, and all her symptoms
could be listed as possible effects of these \[9, p. 354-360\]. [Dora, a
young victim of sexual harassment, was reported as a protagonist of a
hysteria case]{.underline} for not desiring to be involved with her
abuser and feeling repulsed by his advances \[9, p. 590-600\]. In the
[Little Hans]{.underline} case, a five-year-old, [Freud did not hesitate
to give him a diagnosis even before knowing him personally: his fear of
horses was in fact a fear of being castrated by his father]{.underline},
since Freud believed he sexually desired his mother \[9, p. 645\]. [The
Wolf Man was declared as cured by Freud; however, he kept being treated
by several different analysts for decades, not obtaining any
results]{.underline} \[9, p. 651; 12\].

Those are just some examples of famous clinical cases, but others suffer
from the same problem \[9\]. The success of these kinds of adulterations
and other rhetorical strategies contributed to the building and
widespread recognition of Freud\'s authority role, as well as masking
how fragile his proposal was.

**2\-\--Unrepeatable Experiments**

**Ferreira 21** (Clarice de Madeiros Chaves Ferreira - Vice-President of

MG)

**[Unrepeatable experiments]{.underline}**

As discussed earlier, the theoretical concepts in psychoanalysis are
sustained by Freud and the other major proponents' clinical case
reports, who also followed his tradition of producing anecdotal
evidence. Until today, they maintain their authority over contemporary
analysts:

"André Green, when asked about what was new in psychoanalysis, answered:
Freud. To this playful, but nonetheless very accurate answer, we could
add the list of the great thinkers and practitioners of psychoanalysis
who were essential to the several traditions in which the psychoanalytic
movement was divided since the \'40s. Decades after their deaths, they
continue to be what exists of new, as long as we know how to read them"
\[13, p. 10\].

[Although anecdotal evidence is still being used]{.underline}, in most
cases, as the major means of psychoanalysis dissemination and production
\[14\], [important obstacles are placed when they are employed. A
psychoanalytical clinical case is a type of process that **cannot be
replicated** because it addresses a single subject
individually]{.underline}. However, as Schmidt \[15\] argues,
[replication is one of the most **central processes within empirical
sciences**, and sadly not even psychology gives proper attention to the
matter. It possesses five major functions: **control sampling errors,**
by verifying if the results obtained happened by chance alone; **control
internal validity**, that is, if the procedures adopted were adequate to
answer the research's question; **control the possibility of scientific
fraud**; allow a generalization of the findings to a larger/different
population; and finally, verify if the first hypothesis of the
experiment was correct. In the case of an unrepeatable experiment, the
possibility of performing these analyses is thrown away.]{.underline}

[Besides the impossibility of replication, there are other problems, now
related to human psychology: People are commonly victims of **cognitive
bias** that distorts their judgment and leads to irrational
interpretations more frequently than they usually notice \[16\], and
therapists are not immune. An example could be **confirmation
bias**]{.underline}: someone's initial belief significantly impacts how
they remember situations and how they interpret them, giving more
importance to what apparently confirms their world view rather than
paying attention to what could contradict it. In the case of a
psychoanalyst, this could bring them to understand exactly what they
yearned to, that is, what would supposedly confirm the analytic
hypothesis, regardless if that was or was not the case \[14, p.
139-140\]. [Even if a case report is not a good evidence, it would sound
like a source of theoretical confirmation for an adept, as it is
expected that it would reflect their own preconceptions.]{.underline}

[As Spence \[17\] shows, even if someone wished to analyze the veracity
of the reported clinical phenomena, the person still has to face the
fact that they are **frequently replaced by fictional narrative**. Their
contents could be partially reported, omitted, distorted, and mixed with
other case contents, even in a non-intentional way, precisely because
they are based on the therapist\'s memory. Psychoanalytical clinical
case reports are **not sufficiently controlled**, so when they aim to
support a human psychological theory, they end up being just **fuel for
a system of self-confirmations**]{.underline}. There is no way to
generalize a human psychological theory based on anecdotal clinical
evidence, neither to guarantee its reliability, because a
nonsystematized process does not aim to control variables that can
interfere with the conclusions. At the same time, there are reasons to
expect that distortions are going to happen.

**3\-\--Handpicked Examples**

**Ferreira 21** (Clarice de Madeiros Chaves Ferreira - Vice-President of
the Brazilian Association of Evidence-Based Psychology and holds a

University of Minas Gerais, "Is psychoanalysis a pseudoscience?

MG)

**[Handpicked examples]{.underline}**

As already discussed in previous sections, the widespread use of
anecdotal evidence would be an excellent example to fulfill this third
criterion, precisely because those [cases are **isolated** and **exposed
to bias**. However, along with them, another endeavor of contemporary
psychoanalysis is neuropsychoanalysis]{.underline}. Neuropsychoanalysis
is a movement that looks for an integration between neuroscience and
psychoanalysis, and despite being rejected by part of the psychoanalytic
community that wants no part in it, some others consider it to be a
contemporary version of the theory.

Callegaro \[18, p. 207-20\] argues that, instead of what the
neuropsychoanalytical movement declares, the scientific literature shows
something opposite to union: [The evidence from neuroscience either
refutes or directly conflicts with psychoanalysis. It is not as if it
was plausible to use psychoanalysis as a reference model; it is in the
new unconscious model that neuroscientists rely on, and not on the
psychodynamic one.]{.underline}

Paris \[14, p. 94-99\] argues that [neuropsychoanalysis is not operating
in order to evaluate Freudian and neuroscientific theories in an
unbiased way, but rather **starts from the principle of validating
Freud\'s model beforehand**]{.underline}, even though it showed not to
have a consistent hypothesis with modern neuroscience. The author lists
some reasons that show why [**neuropsychoanalysis is far from science**:
In this doctrine, it is previously assumed that Freud was right, and
research would serve the only purpose of proving what was already
obvious from the psychoanalytic point of view; the majority of
neuropsychoanalysis papers do not present concrete data, but theoretical
speculations; methods used to measure basic psychoanalytic concepts are
**still pretty rudimentary**; and, finally, there are many difficulties
and problems, even in neuroscience itself, to adequately locate mental
functions in specific brain areas.]{.underline}

[In the end, it is noticeable that neuropsychoanalysis consists in a
**great cherry picking of data**]{.underline}, in which its proponents
"attempt to systematically associate almost every neuroscientific
concept or finding with a quote from Freud" \[19, p. 170\], giving the
impression that when neurological phenomena such as anosognosia, memory
problems, brain damage and others are associated with concepts from the
Freudian model, that would mean that they were, from the beginning, an
adequate theoretical explanation given by its founder, but that is not
the case.

**[Unwillingness to Test]{.underline}**

[Most psychoanalysts assume as true that human subjectivity is above all
possible scientific analysis \[20-21\]. Thus, since the foundation of
psychoanalysis and until the present day with its contemporary version,
psychoanalysts **carry on the tradition** of being resistant to testing
their hypothesis, whether they are about clinical effectiveness or
theoretical constructs]{.underline}. Melanie Klein, for example, can be
"dismissed (...) from the point of view of empirical science (...) while
many of Klein's ideas were based on what she called 'infant
observation', they actually consisted only of speculations about what
infants might be thinking" \[14, p. 55\]. Also, ["there has **never been
empirical research** on any of the constructs that Lacan proposed" \[14,
p. 122\], and "**neither neo-Freudian models**, nor ego psychology,
**nor relational psychoanalysis**, nor self-psychology, **have ever
conducted empirical investigations** of their theories, or of the
process and outcome of the treatment approaches derived from these
ideas"]{.underline} \[14, p. 55-56\].

Despite the different opinions in the psychoanalytic community about the
scientific status of the doctrine, it is possible to observe that the
majority of adepts have great resistance towards the adoption of
systematized tools and processes for data collection, under the argument
that their object of study, humans, are too singular and unique to be
understood by a supposed "positivistic science", in which only empirical
experiments are allowed \[22\]. It is explicitly said by psychoanalysts,
for example, that they believe "that today it is essential to
demonstrate that psychoanalysis does not need new scientific foundations
that would be provided in a \'systematic\' and \'safe\' way" \[23, p.
15\], that the psychoanalytic cure could not be apprehended in terms of
efficacy criteria, as would be done in psychiatry \[24\], and that the
establishment of criteria for assessing psychotherapeutic effectiveness
would be considered a threat to subjectivity \[20\]. There is even a
clear opposition to those who seek these objectives:

"What we can perceive in contemporary times, is that many professionals
in the psi field, when they come across the symptom presented by the
individual, seek to annihilate it, not taking into account the ethical
dimension through which the symptom manifests itself. This means that
the vast contemporary psychotherapeutic proposals that announce to the
world a way of treatment increasingly supported by science, in addition
to the current proposal in the field of mental health that plays
insistently with the possibility of defining a common norm, are not
committed to the experience revealed by psychoanalysis (\...). We will
see that [psychoanalysis poses itself as an obstacle to this
psychological and medical attitude" \[25, p. 242\].]{.underline}

[As previously seen, using the broad definition of science, disciplines
such as philosophy, history, linguistics, and other humanities can be
considered sciences, even without using traditional experimentation,
because the most adequate methods to look for truth in those particular
circumstances are being employed. However, **psychology and psychiatry
are not in the same situation**: There is **no reliable way** to acquire
the most epistemically justified beliefs about human behavior without
resorting to systematic empirical methodologies. Humans **do not have
the ability to**, using only speculation, develop reliable enough
beliefs about these topics. Therefore, while psychoanalysis rejects
those methods, it cannot be the most reliable psychological doctrine of
our time.]{.underline}

Instead, some of its adepts are aligning it to relativistic positions.
This fuels the notion that science is only one more discourse, and it
could not claim to have better interpretations about reality than any
other:

["The fact remains that **science is a discourse**]{.underline}. As
banal as that statement may seem, it implies a dethroning of Science and
a reassessment of science as one discourse among many. Freud may be
interpreted as translating 'rationality' into 'rationalization', and
Lacan\'s discourse theory suggests that there are as many different
claims to rationality as there are different discourses" \[26, p. 138\].

[Science is accused of being the real dogma, and psychoanalysis then
comes to break it \[27\]. Therefore, it does not have to bow to its
methods, including systematic testing]{.underline} \[22\]. In fact, some
aspects of the psychanalytic doctrine have the stated purpose of serving
"as an epistemological obstacle to the attempt of scientifically
addressing the psyche" (p. 237), and also to the evidence based
treatments of mental health disorders \[25\]. [**Psychoanalysis requires
the unreasonable**: it demands special protection and would not admit
being judged like any other scientific doctrine should be, while also
aims to have a similar status that any other would have. However, if the
same level of recognition and appreciation is demanded, then it **must
be evaluated by similar requirements** for rigor and presentation of
evidence.]{.underline}

Despite the majority of the community being averted to hypothesis
testing, there are some exceptions to this rule. Attachment theory is
probably the most promising contemporary revision of psychoanalytic
theory, for being the only one that is more open to the testing of
hypothesis and empirical research \[14, p. 62\], and for the same reason
it is rejected by other psychoanalysts as something that is not
legitimately part of the doctrine \[14, p. 56-57\]. Unfortunately,
attachment theory does not consider genetic and temperamental aspects
\[14, p. 58\], and its predictions between child attachment patterns and
adulthood are very weak \[28\], while psychoanalysis places the major
causes of adult psychopathologies precisely in the childhood.

About psychoanalysis as a treatment: even though there was great
resistance from the community, some studies on its psychotherapeutic
efficacy were conducted. Nowadays, long-term [psychotherapies usually
**do not have convincing evidence** for their effectiveness, and in this
category long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy is included
\[14\].]{.underline} One example can be observed with the Leichsenring
and Rabung meta-analysis \[29\]. Despite being one of the most cited
works done to evaluate this kind of psychotherapy, it was severely
criticized for failing in all the quality criteria required of
meta-analyses \[30\]. One of the common strategies that psychoanalysts
adopt to deal with the lack of good evidence is turning to their
personal experiences, and this can be observed in the following report
published by the International Psychoanalytical Association:

["It is easy to be critical of psychoanalytic studies. There are no
definitive studies which show psychoanalysis to be unequivocally
effective relative to an active placebo or an alternative method of
treatment. There are **no methods available** that might definitively
indicate the existence of a psychoanalytic process. Most studies have
major limitations which might lead critics of the discipline to discount
their results. Others have limitations that are so grave that even a
sympathetic reviewer might be inclined to discount the findings. (\...)
As]{.underline} psychoanalysts we all know that psychoanalysis works.
Our own analytic experience is probably sufficient in most instances to
persuade us of its effectiveness" \[31, p. 283\].

When compared to long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy, the shortterm
psychodynamic one has a higher number of studies reported in the
literature, with mostly favorable results \[14\]. [However,
psychotherapy in general faces problems with higher complexity than this
article can cover. The majority of results on the topic, no matter what
type of psychotherapy is investigated, tend to show positive effects,
with few exceptions. Although, there is evidence that, in many cases,
those results are biased or have questionable methodology.]{.underline}

[Dragioti \[32\] conducted an umbrella review of meta-analyses about
various types of psychotherapy (including psychodynamic). They realized
that only **16** of **247 meta-analyses** (7%) were capable of providing
good evidence without bias, and **none were from psychodynamic or
psychoanalytic approaches**.]{.underline} Besides the discussion about
psychoanalysis\'s scientific status, this is undoubtedly a topic that
requires more attention from clinical professionals, psychologists and
psychiatrists.

**[Disregard of refuting information]{.underline}**

[There is evidence that many of the key concepts of psychoanalysis are
**wrong**]{.underline}, but notwithstanding, they keep being adopted in
Brazilian universities and as a theoretical basis for clinical practice.
[The empirical literature **did not support the psychoanalytical theory
about dreams** \[33\], **memory or repression** \[34\]. The brain does
not work making permanent recordings about situations that are then
repressed \[14, p. 30\]. Despite recognizing that unconscious processes
exist and significantly impact human beings, the psychodynamic
unconscious that is governed by repressed desires and drives **does not
receive empirical support**]{.underline} \[14, p. 29- 30\]. As an
alternative, the new unconscious theory is more coherent with
contemporary discoveries in the field of neuroscience \[14, p. 29-30;
18\].

[**Psychoanalysis ignores other possible variables**, like genetics,
social class, and more, treating a single and specific traumatic event
that happened during the subject's childhood as the causation of present
disorders. However, there is **no good evidence** of causal links
between specific, traumatic childhood experiences and disorders in adult
life \[35\]. Other stressing events that happen during an individual\'s
life are much more impactful than the infancy ones, and social
disadvantages could better explain the worse mental health outcomes of
these groups \[35\]. There is **no good evidence that remembering past
events would be a good route** to cure psychopathological symptoms,
despite it being the usual route of analysis \[14, p.
107]{.underline}\]. Even with all those disparities between scientific
data and the analytic view, those concepts are kept alive until the
present day.

MG)

**[Built-in subterfuge]{.underline}**

This item covers similar aspects to Popper's criticism. However, [it is
not the same as the falsifiability criterion,]{.underline} since [what
matters for falsifiability is the possibility of a given theory to be
proven false]{.underline}. For Popper, there is no such thing as
"confirmation" by induction. This item proposed by Hansson better
encompasses theory designs that are always confirming, or that can only
confirm the original hypothesis, in which alternative outcomes are not
possible. [About the topic, Rillaer \[36\] provides a group of examples
of why psychoanalysis **cannot be disconfirmed**, only continuously
confirmed. With it, **everything could be explained in the light of
unconscious processes**, and finding contrary evidence would be
**inconceivable**:]{.underline}

"Have you forgotten your umbrella in a friend\'s house? You want to come
back to his house. (...) Does he react badly to your interpretation? 'He
is defending himself', he is resisting to the 'id' that talks inside
him, 'without the ego noticing'. Does he criticize Freud or Lacan? He is
revolting against the Father. (...) Does your son fear horses? He fears
being castrated by his father because he desires his mother. Does your
analysis make you suffer more each day? You are finally entering the
deepest layers of your unconscious. Do the analyst\'s prices seem
excessive? You are having a 'negative transference' or a 'regression to
the analsadistic stage'. After five years of analysis, do you still feel
painful symptoms? You have not dug deep enough, you desire to suffer
because your superego is excessively strong" \[36, p. 154\].

A psychoanalyst could counterargue that this would be a case of wild
psychoanalysis, and within the clinical context they would not impose
interpretations, but instead would build them in a unique relationship
between therapist and client, reserved for the clinical environment
\[37\]. However, this does not refute the objection that [psychoanalysis
is a system that operates by those rules. It is not for the depth of the
dialogue or the time of interaction that it would happen
differently.]{.underline}

Boudry and Buekens \[38\] argue that [**psychoanalysis operates
similarly to a conspiracy theory**, in which criticism can always be
labeled as derived from resistance, and in the case of psychoanalysis,
it is an unconscious resistance. Not even a critic or patient's
rejection of the analytic explanations could be seen as a possible
counterexample: It would only be a major confirmation that unconscious
and unobservable processes are happening. Also, if they agree with the
offered interpretations, the explanation stays the same: It was a
process originated from the unconscious]{.underline}. In the end, when
dealing with the psychodynamic unconscious, there is no possibility to
accept contrary evidence. In relation to psychoanalysis, for all
circumstances "interpretation can be a weapon" \[39, p. 12\].

[Therefore, the excessive number of explanations that would fit all the
possible cases is **not really explicative**; it only seems to be. The
chosen interpretations to deal with the variety of human psychological
phenomena are **not based on good and carefully collected scientific
evidence**. Instead, those are concepts that **lack empirical support**,
used to explain every behavior and also its opposite]{.underline}.
\"Psychoanalysis is indeed irrefutable, because it can say everything
and its opposite --- summoning up the \'servile\' unconscious
testimonial is enough, as it is always ready to bow to the
circumstances' demands\" \[40, p. 140\].

**7\-\--Explanations are Abandoned without Replacement**

MG)

**[Explanations are abandoned without replacement]{.underline}**

[The definitions given to the concepts of \"cure\", \"health\" and
\"disease\" in psychoanalysis fit this criterion. Neves \[23\] says that
the discussion about the cure in contemporary psychoanalysis cannot
occur if it does not start with a **critique of the traditional meaning
of the term**, and the same goes for the other two
concepts]{.underline}. The author argues that psychoanalysis understands
that, according to medical point of view, which adopts the traditional
use of these, a state of health should refer to a harmonious state,
completely free of diseases and pathologies. In addition, unlike medical
objectives, Priszkulnik \[41\] states that \"psychoanalysis is opposed
to the objective of mental health to reintegrate the individual into the
social community\". Still according to Neves \[23\], psychoanalysts
understand that in medicine "cure" would mean conforming to an idealized
mode of operation based on ideas of normality that are socially accepted
and expected, starting from the elimination of diseases and the
reestablishment of the previously present health state. Or, more
succinctly, it would be \"the realization of an experience that leads
the individual to health through the elimination of the disease\" \[23,
p. 33\].

[Considering the traditional definition, psychoanalysis would **accuse
the existence of hidden intentions behind the goal of curing people in
distress**: this would, in reality, be an attempt to exert social
control \[23, p. 16\]. Therefore, it would make more sense to be
**helpless instead of cured**, since: "We must not forget that being
helpless, from both psychoanalytic and political points of view, means
to a large extent having crossed the ghost of infinite protection by the
instituted power. To be helpless (\...) is to sustain the political
action as an action that forces the impossible not to cease not writing
itself in the situation\" \[23, p. 28\].]{.underline}

[For some, like Nasio, it would **not even make sense to conceive
healing as a concept**:]{.underline}

["We cannot say that the cure, understood as a reduction or
disappearance of suffering linked to symptoms, is a psychoanalytic
concept. We also cannot say it is an objective towards which the
treatment should aim, or a criterion that allows us to evaluate its
progress (\...) we cannot make cure a concept, or an objective, or a
criterion, and that is equivalent to not giving in to the influence of
the medical model, which tends to hypostasize this cure, to give it a
status, to elevate it to the dignity of a concept (\...) there is **no
psychoanalytic concept of cure**, and that cannot be a goal that the
analyst should pursue in their practice, differently from how it happens
in medicine" \[42, p. 160\].]{.underline}

Even with these considerations, some proposals for new definitions were
supposedly made, in order to replace the traditional ones; however, they
are usually empty and worse than the previous ones. \"Health in
psychoanalysis can only be understood as a normativity that becomes
individualized, so it is impossible to think of it as the expression of
an absolute value, that is, of a general norm\" \[23, p. 28\]. It could
also be added the observation that \"it is true that psychoanalysis does
not take health as a constitutive element of its ethics and cure
policy\" \[43, p. 23\]. Regarding the definition of disease, we can
understand it in psychoanalysis as being \"a productive experience of
indeterminacy\" \[23, p. 18\], while also considering that \"the
disease, whether it be psychic or organic, does not mean anything other
than the reduction of the tolerance margin for changes in the
environment\" \[23, p. 28\]. In fact, they affirm that there is
something special within the field of disease: \"being sick is,
initially, assuming an identity with great performative force\" \[44, p.
293\], and the curative ideal \"aims to weaken the power that inhabits
the experiences of the pathological, the abnormal, the inhuman and of
helplessness\" \[23, p. 21\].

As for the cure, several options are offered in psychoanalysis. Some of
them are as follows: \"getting cured is, therefore, to build and
experience a new order, that is, the cure involves experiencing
unprecedented ways of adjusting to the environment\" \[23, p. 18\]. Or
also, "to carry out an experiment that is nowhere and cannot be
registered in the situation" \[23, p. 8\]. For psychoanalysts, \"the
cure in psychoanalytic experience can be defined, fundamentally, by the
idea of transformation, that is, the realization of a subjective
experience that is not the reestablishment of the norm nor the expected
result of performing a treatment method\" \[23, p. 84\]. Dunker and
Peron \[24, p. 89\] argue that the concept of cure can have different
interpretations based on Freud\'s work, in addition to not being related
to traditional medicine. One of them could be that the \"cure coincides
with the knowledge of the causes of the symptoms\" \[24, p. 86\]. In
Neves\'s \[23\] view, Freud and Lacan\'s works have as their legacy the
definition of cure as an experience that touches the impossible \[23, p.
25\]. According to Nasio "the cure is an imaginary value, an opinion, a
prejudice, a preconception, just as nature, happiness or justice are"
\[42, p. 160\]. Not only that, but according to the definitions given in
psychoanalysis, \"the cure as the realization of a singular experience
will not be identical to anything\" \[43, p. 24\]. In any case, it is
important to be aware of the fact that even if it is understood in these
ways adapted by the doctrine and even by Freud himself as a
"reorganization of the Ego", it remains as an ideal that is "harmful to
the analysis and to the psychoanalyst" \[42, p. 167\]: a therapist who
seeks the cure of his patient would possibly be under the influence of
feelings of pride and narcissism \[42, p. 168\]. Psychoanalysis, even
though it is treated as a psychotherapy, does not have curing as a goal
as seen in Lacan's words, quoted by Nasio:

[\"(\...) the mechanism (of analysis) is not oriented towards the cure
as a purpose. I am not saying anything that Freud has not already
powerfully formulated: every inflection towards the cure as a purpose
--- making the analysis a pure and simple means to a precise end ---
gives something that **would be linked to the shortest path which could
only falsify the analysis**\" \[42, p. 159\].]{.underline}

[For psychoanalysis, the definition of cure as an experience that leads
to health must be replaced by an experience that is nowhere, **does not
concern any possible situation**, has nothing to do with the objectives
proposed by a treatment, and is impossible. It would not be identical to
anything, and if it is not identical to anything, it could not even be
identical to itself, and that would constitute a logical contradiction.
In psychoanalysis, **the cure is imaginary, and even
harmful**]{.underline}. In the case of health, this would be an
individualized normativity that is not included in the ethical demands
of the doctrine. Meanwhile, attempts to treat illness are accused of
being attempts at social control, and influenced by narcissism and
pride. Diseases and pathologies could not, in psychoanalysis, be
considered as a deviation from the organic standard, but instead they
are classified as sources of some kind of renegade power, instead of
suffering. These concepts, in their many variations, are supposedly
presented as possible replacements for the traditional concepts of
\"cure\", \"health\" and \"disease\". However, [even though the
traditional definitions can be criticized and have gaps, the definitions
adopted in psychoanalysis make these concepts much more vague and
distant from reality than their original versions, with some of them to
a point where they **are no longer comprehensible**. This makes the new
proposal much less explanatory than the traditional one.]{.underline}

**8\-\--Obscurantism**

MG)

**[Obscurantism]{.underline}**

[A lot could be said about the obscurantism problem, its relations with
pseudoscience, and its pertinence as a part of a
demarcation]{.underline} criteria. However, there is not a claim of
being exhaustive in this section, despite being offered the following
explanations for the introduction of this new item:

[Obscurantism is a communication style, commonly adopted by
pseudoscientists as a rhetorical strategy, that happens when the
presentation of the assertions or concepts in a theory is done in a
significantly imprecise way, **preventing an adequate comprehension of
its proposal.** This protects it from objections: Since its definitions
are excessively vague, it is **always possible to accuse the critic of
not comprehending** it, as well as alternating the definitions in order
to adopt or abandon its numerous meanings, using them respectively in
the most opportune moments.]{.underline}

An obscurantist text, despite appearing to bring a robust content about
a topic, in fact does not \[10\]. This seems relevant especially when
comparing it to the definition of pseudoscience: Similarly, in the
obscurantism case, an impression of scientificity is created when in
fact there is a considerable distance from science (in the broad sense).
For that reason, the introduction of this item seems justified.

[In some obscurantism cases, a series of claims are made, but in
reality, they are **proclaimed as phrases that lack truth value**, that
is, phrases that cannot be true or false]{.underline}. In others, even
if some meaning could be salvaged, an unclearness is imposed under their
real definition by the own author, preventing readers from tracing
precise or consensual interpretations about what they intended to say.
[This creates more difficulties for placing objections: It is harder to
criticize a position that one cannot adequately comprehend compared to
another that exposes its arguments explicitly and clearly]{.underline}.
Also, it is important to notice that, under many circumstances, concept
changes are welcome in science, but in order to do so, reasonable
justifications must be presented. This is not taken into account by the
obscurantist.

[In the case of psychoanalysis, some things have changed from Freud\'s
times to the present day, but despite not being many, they also were
**not adopted based on the emergence of good evidence**]{.underline}.
The great psychoanalytical theories of the present are still used,
adopted and taught without going through empirical testing \[14\],
showing that the [changes were **arbitrary** and probably aimed just to
**adapt to each age's cultural climate**. An example of this could be
the change in the pathological status regarding the sexual orientation
of gays and lesbians, as well as penis envy \[4\]. A]{.underline} theory
supposedly evolving and changing its concepts over time only has merits
if those changes are made based on good evidence, and not only by
cultural influence; after all, even religious movements change their
explanations about the world as the centuries go by, and this is no
reason to classify them as scientific.

Cioffi \[4\] points out that the etiological role of sexuality suffered
with an opportunistic change of meanings. Ideas about sexuality,
eroticism, and libido had their definitions chosen arbitrarily by Freud
according to the context: When questioned by the skeptic, they became
something that would represent fraternal love, affection, or in the case
of sexual drives they would be desires that could be satisfied by using
a variety of senses, including non-genital ones. Meanwhile, in safer and
more receptive environments, those conveniently change back to mean
\"sexual\" in the traditional sense.

["As psychoanalytic theory is **entirely empty,** it is also, at the
same time, supremely adaptable. When some concept of the theory shows to
be **hard to sustain**, or even **downright embarrassing** (...) it is
enough to silently abandon it and take a new **theoretical rabbit out of
the immense top hat of the unconscious**. This is what psychoanalysts
like to describe as the 'progress' of psychoanalysis (...).]{.underline}
What is given as progress in psychoanalysis is nothing but the ultimate
interpretation, that is, the most acceptable in a specific
institutional, historical or cultural context" \[40, p. 140-141\].

Buekens and Boudry \[10\] show that [Lacanian psychoanalysis is another
example of obscurantism. Lacan]{.underline} assumes that the unconscious
is structured as a language, and defends that his writings are
equivalent to the expression of his own unconscious. The adherence to an
obscurantist style is, therefore, justified from his point of view. In
this way, [any systematic effort to interpret him would be **destined to
fail,** and this immunizes the doctrine against any possible criticism.
Even if Lacan gave the impression of being an authority about human
psychology that would transmit his ideas through occult means, it would
be up to the reader to interpret him (in the countless ways of doing
so), while still being susceptible to possible accusations of not really
understanding him.]{.underline}

Buekens and Boudry \[10\] argue that since it is not possible to trace
definitive conclusions about what Lacan really meant to say, the only
thing left for the reader is to subjectively interpret him according to
their personal experience, what creates a significant divergence of
interpretations by the adepts themselves. The psychoanalyst not only
used an obscurantist language in his works, but also assumed and
defended its use explicitly:

["I would say that it is with a deliberate, if not entirely deliberate,
intention that I pursue this discourse in such a way as to **offer you
the opportunity to not quite understand**. This margin enables you
yourselves to say that you think you follow me, that is, that you remain
in a **problematic position**, which always leaves the door open to a
**progressive rectification**" \[45, p. 164\].]{.underline}

**[1ar falsifiability matters]{.underline}**

**Falsifiability matters -- treating psychoanalysis like it's not a
pseudoscience is a dogmatic move that leads to scientific stagnation and
prevents discipline development**

This article pointed out that [psychoanalysis --- not only on its
classic, but also with its contemporary version]{.underline} --- ends up
checking all of the seven items in Hansson's multicriteria list. It also
fits the eighth item that was introduced in this work. So, in this way,
psychoanalysis [checks eight out of eight demarcation of
**pseudoscience's items**]{.underline}. The evidence presented in this
article suggests that with both Popper and Hansson's demarcation
proposals, and taking into account its traditional and contemporary
versions, [psychoanalysis is **indeed a pseudoscience**. Even if the
impression that it represents the most reliable human psychological
theory is created by its proponents, that is not the case, because it
considerably **deviates from scientific standards of
quality**]{.underline}.

Although research in psychoanalysis is widespread in Brazil, its
objections are not being discussed in the literature, and this may be an
indicator of alienation \[46\]. [The maintenance of a dogmatic approach
on a doctrine inserted in the academic environment is **dangerous**,
since it can lead to **scientific stagnation** and prevent the full
**development of its disciplines**, which in the case of psychoanalysis
are psychology and psychiatry]{.underline}. It is important to further
discuss criticisms of psychoanalysis, given that it is still treated as
one of the main theoretical and clinical models for the comprehension of
human behavior inside the academy. Even from an ethical perspective, it
is important to carry out practices and build theories that are
compatible with the best scientific evidence. [There is **no good moral
justification** for believing in whatever the theory, if it does not
have enough evidence in its favor \[47\].]{.underline}

[The key to moving beyond]{.underline} both positivism and [the
deconstruction of meaning is]{.underline} the foundation of questioning
and the concept of [the problematological answer. Politics is surely the
**sphere of debate** over the meaning of public problems and how to
solve them. If we disagree on a question, we **argue** about it, add to
it with other questions]{.underline}, ~~weaken~~ it, [and debate the
**pro and con of the possible answers**. A plurality of meanings means a
plurality of answers, which indicates contingency, but it is **not an
aporia**]{.underline} (an impassable obstruction to knowledge) (see
Derrida 1993). [It simply entails that meaning is in question.74 This
establishes rhetoric as a legitimate dimension of discourse because
problematological answers have an equal status, as answers, to
apocritical answers. Some questions **cannot be solved** beyond dispute
but they can be expressed and **then debated**]{.underline}. In fact, as
I pointed out in Chapter Four, there is no argumentation in
poststructuralism, because if signification were a free play of meaning
it would be impossible to indicate one answer to a question over another
(Meyer 1995: 238). Similarly, while Foucault depicts a figurative
picture of discourse (see Foucault 1970) he has no argumentation, which
perhaps accounts for the feeling that agency is absent in his work. [But
while we are 'prisoners' of language, defined by it in important ways,
we can **reflect upon our boundaries as well**, through questioning,
even if this is difficult. Knowledge has its own inertia because we
operate on the basis of presumed answers and so reality appears
continuous]{.underline} (Meyer 2000; see also Chapter Seven).
Nonetheless, it is also open to question and therefore we are not always
powerless. Even those working within an established discourse have to
continually reinforce its legitimating power, and therefore can escape
responsibility only by rhetorical means. Hence powerful elites have a
strategic interest in arguing for particular ways of framing problems.
Agency and structure are in reason, and we can understand both in terms
of questioning. Rationality is still possible, so our task should be to
reverse the fragmentary reductionism of science and the internal
fragmentation of radical poststructuralism but without reimposing the
problem solving model upon reality as the sole, unjustified criterion of
resolution. By drawing on Meyer's concept of problematological answers,
we can establish what is rational and what is irrational about politics
without judging it in scientific terms. This is essential if we are to
understand policymaking, which is multidisciplinary.

In political theory, where poststructuralism is enjoying contemporary
popularity, for example with Laclau and Mouffe (1985) and Zizek (1999),
[poststructuralists argue that politics emerges from the failure of
ontology to establish the conceptual closure of reason]{.underline}.
Laclau and Mouffe, for example, [identify the breakdown of
foundationalism with an appreciation of the contingency underlying
social relations as the source of politics, in contrast to scientific
utopianism which searches for an]{.underline} essence (1985: 142-3).
However, [if ontology is a failed approach to philosophy then **why**
**develop an alternative philosophy** based on this
failure?]{.underline} Meyer makes this criticism of Derrida by pointing
out that the concept of 'trace' of the subject actually reinstates
Cartesianism in a new guise, albeit one of radical negativity: 'Is it
not quite simply an insurmountable contradiction to want to declare the
death of Cartesianism, while in the same breath overcoming that death by
stating that the subject is a trace of itself?' (1995: 136). He [points
out a similar contradiction in Lacan's assertion that **the 'lack' of
reality is reality**, asking if this does not, in fact, reveal a
foundational problematicity that]{.underline} [defines]{.underline}
humanity (1995: 136-7). Robinson's (2004) review of several works
drawing on Lacanian theory, including books by Mouffe and Zizek, sums up
the problems of this approach to politics very well. He points out that
[Lacanian theorists work from **ontology rather than
politics**]{.underline} (2004: 261). [Instead of articulating
contingency, 'lack' is instead reified into an essence; a nihilistic,
fundamental negativity (2004: 259). This actually tends to **exclude
politics from theory** by essentialising negativity in exactly the same
way as the totalising theories they reject (2004: 268).]{.underline}

[We will not be able to theorise 'the political' adequately without
expressing the problematicity that defines it. Despite affirming
contingency as essential to reason, poststructuralist theories have
little to say about rhetoric. Instead, they speak of politics in terms
of the impossibility of reason (Zizek 1999) or as defined by antagonism
(Laclau and Mouffe 1985).]{.underline} Why should we speak of politics
in such radical terms? When we are faced with contingency we resort to
persuasion in order to reach a solution. However, poststructuralists
barely speak ofrhetoric in its traditional sense as 'persuasion' because
the theory derives from the idea that literal discourse is only possible
by repressing other meanings. Yet [we know that policy, for example,
does effectively make pronouncements that **function at a literal
level**, **no matter what symbolic meaning might be attributed to
it;**]{.underline} a bus timetable, for example. [Politics deals with
contingency, yet it does reach answers despite this]{.underline}. Hence
poststructuralism seems only to apply to cases of radical social
disjuncture or, on the other hand, to define everything that makes sense
as authoritarian. [Apart from the fundamental **dissatisfaction we feel
about a theory that thematises politics** in only a negative light, such
a theory does not help us conclude anything about policy, which deals
with answers as much as questions.]{.underline}

**Problem solving is good, it's the only way to express identity and
establish a foundation for knowledge -- their theory is reductionist,
paradoxically replicates the shortcomings of ontology, and crowds out
politics**

**Turnbull 05** (Nick Turnbull PhD -- Lecturer in Politics at the
University of Manchester, "Policy in question: from problem solving to
problematology", University of New South Wales, February 2005,
https://www.academia.edu/download/66798539/SOURCE02.pdf, MG)

[If poststructuralism has a critical value it is because it
**questions** established theory]{.underline} and therefore has at least
questioning as a fundamental property [(even if it does not affirm this,
because it affirms nothing), which indicates that it is possible to
answer. Policymaking involves **posing questi**ons and **settling upon
answers**]{.underline}. Hence, we cannot understand it without a
philosophical framework that accounts for both questioning and
answering. Dewey's practical orientation is something to hold on to
because [policymaking does seek **practical solutions**. Political
reasoning is **not necessarily irrational**, even if it can be when
people employ irrational discourse to their own political
advantage.]{.underline}

[Radical postmodernism or poststructuralism is **not sufficient for
understanding policymaking** not just because it is abstract,
nonpractical philosophy, but because it actually rejects
philosophy]{.underline}. In this sense, it has much in common with
positivism even though they are quite different. This is Meyer's view of
these two streams of twentieth century thought, and in their rejection
of questioning he identifies a common thread (1994: 44). Science
restricts rationality by rejecting philosophy in favour of solving
problems empirically; [nihilism (poststructuralism) rejects philosophy
by saying that we have only questions, while failing to thematise this
as positive, therefore rejecting rationality along with it. At the same
time, it paradoxically **replicates the shortcomings of ontology** in
rejecting it. Problematology is opposed to both of these.]{.underline}
Meyer thematises the nature of philosophy as questioning and therefore
contemporary problematicity is the condition for the restoration of
philosophy, not its renewed rejection.

I would point out that references to questioning are everywhere in
discussions of postmodernity and postmodernism. For example, Smart
describes postmodernity as the period in which the values of Western
civilisation are 'justifiably in question', as that which 'called into
question or subjected to doubt' modern ideas of progress (1993: 26, 28).
He cites Giddens' description of a generalised problematicity across
society, and not just of philosophy, when he noted that ['we
increasingly find ourselves "left with questions where once there
appeared to be answers"' (1993: 35). It is in the very nature of
modernity to generate the radically reflexive questioning that now
encompasses modernity itself]{.underline}, says Zygmunt Bauman, who
describes the postmodern social condition as 'an incessant flow of
reflexivity' that produces 'institutionalized pluralism, variety,
contingency and ambivalence' (1992: 149). Not dissimilarly, Lyotard
stated that postmodernity is in fact a consequence of the modernist
drive to question its own presuppositions (1984: 79). And Beck argues
that the pervasive 'doubt' that has arisen around the project of
modernity could provide the basis for a new ethics, modern identity and
social contract (1997: 162). One could find many references to
questioning elsewhere. So, [although Western thought has always put
things into question, what is new is the generalised reflexive
questioning of postmodernity and the lack of new answers.]{.underline}

[In postmodernity, questioning is not just a social condition but even
extends to questioning the foundations of thought itself]{.underline}.
Despite the differences between theorists described as postmodernists,
they share in common the view that metaphysics is at an end. Along with
[**Lyotard**, Baudrillard, Derrida, Foucault, **Lacan**, Fish, and Rorty
have all attacked foundational philosophy]{.underline}. The general view
is that the foundation of knowledge has been called into question and no
new metaphysics will ever be constructed. **[One would think
philosophers had given up]{.underline}.** In the postmodern critique we
see the fragmentation of thought from within, of logical difference
itself, which becomes marked by a 'trace' or a 'lack'. This confusion is
reflected in the uncertainty about the nature of postmodernism itself,
which Smart says seems to bemore a series of questions than a definitive
concept (1993: 12). Thus Lyotard's 'answer' to the question of the
postmodern is 'that which, in the modern, puts forward the unpresentable
in presentation itself' (1984: 81). Postmodernism, then, is the
non-closure of reason, the irrational without which the rational could
not exist.

How might we understand postmodernity in a more rational way? If the
postmodern condition is a situation of generalised questioning,
shouldn't this draw our attention to questioning itself? Indeed, what is
Lyotard's 'incredulity toward metanarratives' (1984: xxiv) if not an
affirmation of questioning as a primary stance? Despite this,
[postmodern thinkers have not considered questioning for itself. In
fact, questioning has received very little attention at all in
philosophy, which has always questioned in practice even though it has
never been its central]{.underline} theme (Meyer 1995: 6). Philosophers
in the twentieth century did pay more attention to questioning, for
example, to understand meaning (Collingwood 1939, 1962; Gadamer 1979),
logic (Hintikka 1999) and politics (Castoriadis 1991). But while these
thinkers valued questioning, they did so in only a limited way. This is
because philosophy focused on answering, via ontology, and displaced
questioning to a cognitive, rhetorical role.

Despite the title of [Lyotard's]{.underline} paper, 'Answering the
question: what is the postmodern?', he [could not answer satisfactorily
because he **did not recognise the value of questioning in his own
critique**. Because he could not adequately thematise questioning or
answering, postmodern theory became that which paradoxically expresses
progress as the impossibility and undesirability of progress.
Postmodernity is different from modernity, but it also cannot be
different, because difference itself has fragmented]{.underline}.
Postmodernism neither is nor isn't because identity is non-identical
with itself; knowledge fragments from within and the cohesion of reason
collapses. Under these terms conceptual confusion and a lack of meaning
indicate success. But why should we accept this contradiction and mirror
the fragmentation of thought (Meyer 1995: 3), now conceived of as
positive, all the while denying its positivity because such an
affirmation is impossible? Meyer makes the contradiction clear; '...how
can we put as our guiding principle the negation of all guiding
principles?' (Meyer 1995: 3)

Is problematicity really unpresentable? The confusion over the nature of
postmodernity is a natural result of the failure to thematise
questioning as constitutive of reason. If we consider postmodernity in
terms of questioning, postmodernity is the generalised questioning of
modernity and problematology is the only sufficient response to
historical problematisation. Postmodernity emerges from modernity as a
problematological response to modernity's questioning of itself,
modifying the past without completely dissolving it in the answer.

W[ith a rational account of postmodernity as questioning,
poststructuralism and postmodernism are **firmly behind us**, this time
philosophically so, a stop on the path to questioning that has been
superseded by it (Meyer 2001a). Problematology explicates questioning
and establishes a **foundation for knowledge** that also permits us to
describe contemporary problematicity. Problematology is a new
metaphysics to replace ontology]{.underline}. Meyer has created a new
logic and terminology that expresses the problematicity of
postmodernity, a necessary quality for a successful systematic study of
contemporary society (see Bauman 1992: 161). [If identity has
fragmented, then it has become a question that cannot be conclusively
resolved because it expresses several alternative possible answers at
the same time, hence it is rhetorical. The decentering of the subject
makes of us 'an irreducible problem, one for which the only answer, far
from suppressing the question, reproduces it endlessly']{.underline}
(Meyer 1995: 303; see also Castoriadis on identity as a 'puzzle' 1991:
170-1). In postmodernity, our answer to the question of identity is
always problematological, and therefore always in question as much as it
provides an answer. [With increased questioning comes politics and so
political processes operate from, and contribute to, the production of
individual and collective identities. Policymaking is also a part of
this questioning and produces social identity and difference as much as
solving practical problems.]{.underline}

DT. [It seems to me that [a frequent critique of psychoanalysis and
politics is that in its inability]{.mark}]{.underline}, and perhaps
unwillingness [[to propose concrete]{.mark} policy
[reforms]{.mark}]{.underline} or political projects, **[[it falls back
on a notion that everyone should]{.mark} just [undergo
analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Do you think that a political project
that is informed by psychoanalytic teachings implies that we should all
undergo analysis? You write in your book for instance that fantasy is a
crucial point for facilitating a sort of un-bonding process from the
larger capitalist mode of subjectivity. [What do you see as the role of
analysis and political emancipatory work]{.underline}?¶ [**[TM. I will
alienate]{.mark} many of [my analyst friends with this]{.mark}
response**, [but I have no]{.mark} political [investment]{.mark} at all
[in psychoanalytic practice]{.mark}]{.underline}. I've undergone some
analysis myself. However, **[[I don't believe that]{.mark} everyone
[undergoing psychoanalysis would change much]{.mark} at all
politically]{.underline}**. [[What is important about psychoanalysis to
me is its theoretical intervention]{.mark}, its discovery of the death
drive and the role that fantasy plays in our psyche]{.underline}. This
is the great advance. [**[And political struggle can integrate these
theoretical insights without any help from actual
psychoanalysis]{.mark}**. What allows one to disinvest in the capitalist
mode of subjectivity is not]{.underline}, in my view, [the
psychoanalytic session. Instead it is the [confrontation with a mode of
enjoyment]{.mark}]{.underline} that ceases to provide the satisfaction
that it promises. [This [prompts one to think about
alternatives]{.mark}]{.underline}. Obviously, not everyone can become a
theorist, but in a sense, [**[everyone already is a theorist]{.mark}**.
We theorize our enjoyment when we think through our day and plan out
where we're going to do. Even watching a television show requires an
elaborate theoretical exercise. [Making this theorizing
evident]{.mark}]{.underline} and thus arousing an interest in theory
[[is]{.mark} to me much [more important than]{.mark} having a lot of
people undergo [psychoanalysis]{.mark}]{.underline}. In response to your
question about the universalization of psychoanalytic practice, I have
more faith in a universalization of psychoanalytic theory.

Most former freeze activists retain at least some faith in the
democratic process. According to Solo, [[the freeze
campaign]{.underline} at]{.mark} least [[*began*]{.underline}]{.mark} a
long process of "[[educating" the public, and]{.underline}]{.mark} for a
time it [successfully **[transformed]{.mark} "the issues and the
[language used by politicians]{.mark}" [to facilitate discussion of
nuclear]{.mark} issues**, breaking from "the dominant discourse of arms
control]{.underline} and the cold war." But just as this "war of ideas"
was beginning to bear fruit, according to Solo, ["the movement narrowed
its agenda, which in turn constrained its educational program and
confined its politics." [Concerned with answering its right-wing critics
and remaining "respectable" among "political]{.mark} and arms control
[elites]{.mark}," [freeze advocates began **defending the initiative on

goal of breaking out of arms control 'negotiations as

lesson is clear:]{.underline} [that in order "[to develop a mass

the peculiarities of our culture and language]{.underline} and does not
overlook the continuing impact of television on our political life as a

Now [this contrasts with the argument of those who would \"reinvent
government\" by putting up bureaucratic roadblocks to maintaining the
reliability of the US nuclear arsenal through research and
testing]{.underline}. [They reason that if the reliability of
everyone\'s nuclear arsenals declines, everyone will be less likely to
try using them]{.underline}. The problem is that some
\"adventurer-conqueror\" may arise and use everyone\'s doubt about their
arsenals to risk massive conventional war instead. A[n expansionist
[dictatorship might]{.mark} even [risk nuclear war with weapons]{.mark}
that are simpler, cruder, less powerful, much riskier (in terms of the
possibility of accidental detonation) but much more reliable than **our
own may eventually become without adequate \"stockpile
stewardship.\"\[**]{.underline}14\] But **[the inhibitory effect of
reliable nuclear weapons goes deeper than Shirer\'s deterrence of
adventurer-conquerors]{.underline}**. **[It changes the way we think
individually and culturally, [preparing us for a future we cannot now
imagine]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Jungian psychiatrist Anthony J. Stevens
states, \[15\] \"H[istory would indicate that people cannot rise above
their narrow sectarian concerns without some overwhelming paroxysm. It
took the War of Independence and the Civil War to forge the United

[I also continue engaging in nuclear weapons work to help fire that
world-historical warning shot I mentioned above, namely, that as our
beneficial technologies become more powerful, so will our weapons
technologies, unless genuine peace precludes it]{.underline}. **[We must
build a future more peaceful than our past]{.underline}**, **[if we are
to have a future at all]{.underline}**, with or without nuclear weapons
--- a fact we had better learn before worse things than nuclear weapons
are invented. [If you\'re a philosopher, this means that I regard the
nature of humankind as mutable rather than fixed, but that I think most
people welcome change in their personalities and cultures with all the
enthusiasm that they welcome death]{.underline} --- thus, **[the [fear
of nuclear annihilation of ourselves]{.mark} and all our values [may be
what we require in order to become peaceful enough to survive]{.mark}
our [future tech]{.mark}nological breakthroughs]{.underline}**.\[16\]

**Their criticism of nukespeak fails -- its nostalgia for a utopian
world beyond language with authentic relationships to nuclear weapons
merely feeds the fantasy of nuclear control they claim to resolve.
Instead, a subtle struggle over the power of the meaning of nuclear
weapons through our Foucaultien approach solves better.**

From the nuclear critic\'s perspective, nuclear opponents unnecessarily
constrain themselves when they adopt a first political assumption that
is misleading and has not been subjected to the same reflection reserved
for the other terms of the debate. [The [**claim that nukes are
\"unspeakable\"** appears as]{.mark} an intolerable oppression, [a
**paternalistic admonition** to \"be quiet\"]{.mark} that outdistances
(and silences) all such preceding calls]{.underline}. In carry- ing as
well the injunction that we not speak about that which can only be
spoken, this presumption deepens the paradoxes of nukes. There must be a
reason we \"cannot speak,\" and there is. [To speak is to reveal a
paradox nuclear politics must repress]{.underline}. [We can begin to see
the awkward, reversed influence of this repression **when we consider
the one activity by which nuclear opponents have been attentive to
language**---**their focus on interpretations of
\"nukespeak.\"**]{.underline}53 [[Nukespeak actually stands for
**a**]{.mark} **simple [critique of euphemism]{.mark}**]{.underline};
**[the problem is that [this simplicity leads away from the rest of the
critique]{.mark} offered by opponents ---it is inverted]{.underline}**.
**[The nukespeak argument imagines a world, just before this one, which
had no technocratic euphemisms and no evasive verbs and
nouns]{.underline}**. **[Somehow, this was a world without language
games, without genres of political speech, where words \"meant\" some-
thing explicit]{.underline}**. **[That world ---presumably the one that
Einstein argued the nuke inalterably changed ---sits invitingly just
outside our grasp, recover- able if only we would resolutely call things
by their real names]{.underline}**. [The [nukespeak argument conforms
to]{.mark}]{.underline} Baudrillard\'s \"**[[nostalgia for the
real]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" **[[There can be no reconstructive
politics based on]{.mark} [eradicating euphemism]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[The artifacts and practices of nuclearism **have no honest, real
meanings**]{.underline}. **[[There is no straightforward]{.mark} [name
for a]{.mark} protective reaction [strike]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[To
call it a bombing]{.mark} run [trivializes it]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[[To call it genocide]{.mark} (or eco- cide) [conflates it with]{.mark}
phenomena ---such as [the Holocaust]{.mark} ---that we would rather keep
separate, for good reasons]{.underline}. **[And so on]{.underline}**.
**[The activities of nuclearism are encased in a context so thoroughly
bound to its discourse ---technologized, simulated, and then turned into
spectacle --- that any attempt to speak simple truth could only be
another part of the simulation]{.underline}**. This is where nuclear
criticism draws the line between itself and the liberal critics of
modern society, from Orwell on to the present. Either Einstein was right
and the world was irretrievably changed, or he was wrong and it can be
returned to a prior condition of innocence, where things had \"real\"
names. While the nukespeak argument suggests that these things are
nameable, the nuclear critic responds that the nuke has already been
actively reshaping situations. Indeed, that insight on the activism of
nukespeak has been available for some time now. It was Marcuse who
showed how contemporary nuclear discourse is not simple misleading, but
is a manip- ulation that has its own syntax and grammar. Nuclear
criticism might disagree with Marcuse\'s (and, later and more
explicitly, Habermas\'s) pre- sumption that a clearer language game
would be closer to truth. Still, we can note that Marcuse identified the
discursive component of nuclear- ism\'s authority. The forms Marcuse
finds all share a pattern, constructing an inverted universe in which
absurdity and danger serve security and trust. In one important example,
Marcuse deconstructs Edward Teller\'s oft- repeated, unofficial title,
\"the father of the H-Bomb,\" showing how this highly improbable
combination is powerfully useful for discipline: Terms designating quite
different spheres or qualities are forced together into a solid,
overpowering whole. The effect is \... a magical and hypnotic one ---the
projection of images which convey irresistible unity, harmony of
contradictions. Thus the loved and feared Father, the spender of life,
generates the H-bomb for the annihilation of life.54 The cleverness (or,
for Marcuse, the cunning) of such formulations belies the hope that
clarity could solve matters. **[The simplest [nukespeak commentaries ask
the]{.mark} [wrong question when they argue that matters would be more
obvious if terminology were less
euphemistic]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [At a certain point---**in
Utopian remove from the realm of knowledge and power** ---that would be
the case]{.underline}. But [the better question is slightly different.
We could ask, What sort of an authoritative logic would behave this
way]{.underline}? [Founding strength on deterrence, then announcing the
unspeakability of its topic, then pro- ducing a discourse that flaunts
contradiction and turns it into unity and safety, nukespeak is more than
euphemism]{.underline}. [It turns ecstatic]{.underline}. An oppositional
politics, fully capable of problematizing this (hyper-) exuberant
nuclearism, is possible on bases other than such suspect cate- gories as
euphemism, survival, unspeakability, and numbing. Through- out this
book, I am trying to reposition antinuclearism within such a defensible
political practice. At the very least, this implies an intellectual
project; to paraphrase Foucault, [there is a struggle over issues of
knowledge, set off by nuclear criticism]{.underline}. The political mood
of the language-and-politics position is well framed by nuclear
criticism. More precisely, [a political mood could yet form, one that
would contrast sharply with an existing nuclear opposition that, in the
United States, has adopted a paradoxical structure, **as if driven to
mirror the paradoxes of nukes themselves**]{.underline}. [[Antinuke
talk]{.mark} has been ponderous ---so responsible and serious that it
just obviously [defeats itself,]{.mark} and must invent the defense that
\"people really don\'t like to talk about nuclear war very
much]{.underline}.\" **[Paradoxically, opponents then test that
humorlessness by asking citizens to become independent entrepreneurs of
risk, weighing the likelihood and amplitude of possible disasters. It
[should not be surprising that such a politics works]{.mark} only
[intermittently, if at all.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

At the outset, it is important to note that there is neither a single
\"feminism\" nor a single \"pragmatism\" with which it might be aligned.
Instead, there are multiple feminisms, just as there are multiple
pragmatisms. [The \"[pragmatist feminism]{.mark}\" developed in this
essay [draws on]{.mark} several [elements from American
Pragmatism]{.mark}]{.underline}, a philosophical school developed in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, most prominently by
Charles Peirce, William James, John Dewey, and George Herbert Mead.
Despite the many differences among the pragmatists, [they]{.underline}
tend to [share several features]{.underline}. Perhaps [most
salient]{.underline} to the subject of this volume [is their
presumption]{.underline} [\"that human agency]{.underline} in all of its
higher manifestations [has evolved from \... concrete circumstances in
which a vulnerable organism is confronted]{.underline}, often (if not
usually) in concert with other organisms of the same species, [with
possibilities of both injury and fulfillment]{.underline}.\"\' It is
[the continuous reminder of \"human fallibility and
finitude]{.underline}\"\' that **[constrains pragmatists]{.underline}**
from positions such as foundationalism and dogmatism and thus
[**against** ideologies that encourage the use of armed
force]{.underline}, and especially of WMD, [in all but the most extreme
circumstances. It is also a reminder that armed conflicts are composed
of embodied human beings]{.underline}, **[each of whom has the capacity
for suffering]{.underline}** as well as happiness, a point stressed by
feminist analyses of armed conflicts. There are several significant
points of commonality or intersection between pragmatism and feminism.3
Perhaps most important for thinking about the ethics of weapons of mass
destruction is that both are actively engaged in attempting to solve
social problems. The early pragmatists viewed the purpose of
philosophical reflection to be \"the intelligent overcoming of
oppressive conditions.\" Dewey, for example, recommended the criticism
of beliefs underlying society that have led to \"unsatisfactory
conditions in order to radically reconstruct our society according to
non-oppressive and cooperative standards.\"5 [[Feminist goals of
liberating women from oppression]{.underline}]{.mark} thus **[[echo
pragmatist ones]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While most often feminist
movements have been focused specifically on ending the male domination
and oppression of women, [a more inclusive feminist vision has as its
object the elimination of all hierarchical and oppressive
relationships]{.underline}, including the oppression of so-called third
world or developing nations (especially of the Global South) by those of
the so-called first world or industrialized nations (especially of the
Global North), of ethnic, cultural, racial, or religious minorities by
majorities, homosexuals by heterosexuals, the poor by the wealthy,
children by adults, and so on. In addition, [pragmatists advocate the
elimination of sharp divisions between theory and practice, reason and
experience, and knowing and doing]{.underline}.8 [[Pragmatists **focus
much more on consequences**]{.mark} rather [than]{.mark} on [a
priori]{.mark} abstract [conceptualizing]{.mark}]{.underline}, captured
in the phrase that pragmatists assign value on the basis of \"what
works\" or what provides \"emotional satisfaction.\"9 From a pragmatist
perspective, the most important questions are practical ones.
[[Pragmatists consider moral agents]{.mark} to be **actors [within a
concrete]{.mark} particular [context]{.mark}** that both influences what
is experienced and is influenced by those experiences]{.underline}. The
inextricability of the perceiver from what is perceived means that
[**[action]{.mark}**, whether [in the context of armed conflict]{.mark}
and the use of WMD or otherwise,]{.underline} [**[must be situated
within]{.mark} the larger [context]{.mark}** of which it is a
part]{.underline}. [Since every decision to enter or engage in an armed
conflict]{.underline} and every decision to deploy WMD, of whatever
type, [must be considered within the full context of **other relevant
actors, agencies, and term strategies or results**]{.underline},12 [[a
pragmatist perspective is **unlikely** to result in the]{.mark} kind of
[abstract thinking that antiwar feminism criticizes in dominant]{.mark}
just war and [realist approaches]{.mark}]{.underline}.13 Feminism also
shares pragmatism\'s rejection of traditional rationalist and empiricist
approaches and its commitment to the inseparability of theory and
practice.14 Both believe that reason must be grounded in experience and
requires being supplemented, at least in particular circumstances, by
emotion.15 In this respect, feminists also favor a posteriori rather
than a priori forms of knowledge, those that develop on the basis of
experience rather than those that are posited prior to it.16 In sum,
[both pragmatism and feminism accord a central place to the particular,
the concrete, and the factual elements of experience, as opposed to the
universal, the generalizable, and the abstract]{.underline}.17 This
opposition to abstraction is apparent, for example, in feminist
understandings of women\'s \"different voice\" and Dewey\'s views about
the importance of the qualitative background of situations. In contrast
to mainstream philosophy, both feminist and pragmatist perspectives
focus on everyday life and emphasize respect for others and the
constitutiveness of community. [The pragmatists\' sensitivity to the
social embeddedness of persons led them to understand the \"I\" \"only
in relation to other selves, so that the autonomy of individual agents
needed to be integrated with their status as social beings\" existing in
community]{.underline}. 18 [This common conception of the \"relational
self\" suggests that both [pragmatists]{.mark} and feminists will
[resist turning others into \"the Other,\" who can then be demonized
and]{.mark} made into \"the enemy,\" suitable to be
[killed]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The feminist commitment to the well-being
of others, in both the local and the global community, is]{.underline}
well [illustrated by]{.underline} Carol [Cohn\'s and]{.underline} Sara
[Ruddick\'s contribution]{.underline} to this volume. However, [this
commitment also provides the basis for [the pragmatist feminist
position]{.mark} articulated here that **[refuses to categorically rule
out the moral legitimacy of any resort to armed force]{.mark} or war**,
[since such resort may be **morally imperative to protect innocent
others**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition to these marked similarities,
it is also important to acknowledge how a pragmatist feminism differs
significantly from American Pragmatism. Perhaps most important is
pragmatist feminism\'s attention to the gendered character of the social
world and gender\'s impact on the formation and maintenance of male and
female identities. These subjects largely were ignored by the American
Pragmatists19 but influence the analysis of the ethics of WMD outlined
here. In addition, feminists tend to give greater import to the
cognitive aspects of affect than pragmatists, even though, as already
discussed, pragmatists recognize the importance of emotions to agency
and cognition. Despite its differences from more mainstream strands of
feminism, [[pragmatist feminism shares the goals]{.mark} of many strands
of feminism [to **make gender a central consideration**]{.mark} **of the
analysis**]{.underline} (here of armed force and WMD)20 [[and]{.mark} to
[eradicate (patriarchal) oppression]{.mark} and domination]{.underline}.
[[These goals result in]{.mark} a **[strong presumption against]{.mark}
the [use of]{.mark} any [weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}, not only WMD,
[since they are in their very inception designed as tools for domination
and suppression of others designated as \"the enemy]{.underline}.\"
[[This]{.mark} opposition to the use of armed force [is related to
feminist observations of the patriarchal]{.mark} and hierarchical,
[male-dominated]{.mark} and -controlled [character of the military and
the oppressive effects of war and militarism]{.mark}]{.underline} around
the world, [especially on women]{.underline} and children. In addition,
the pragmatist feminist view described here affirms much in the
\"constitutive positions\" of antiwar feminism articulated by Cohn and
Ruddick,21 especially its observation of the gendered character of war
and militarism, its suspicion of masculinist approaches to war and
conflict resolution, and its critique of the dominant tradition for its
focus on the physical, military, and strategic effects of these weapons
separate from their embeddedness in the rest of social and political
life. With this brief overview in mind, in the following section, I
describe how a pragmatist feminist perspective compares with the antiwar
feminist position outlined by Cohn and Ruddick in Chapter 21 with
respect to the specific issues addressed by this volume. SOURCES AND
PRINCIPLES Although pragmatist feminism itself does not directly provide
general norms governing the use of weapons in war, it does so indirectly
through its affirmation of elements of justwar theory, as described
below. [[Pragmatist feminism **does not categorically rule out the use
of armed force**]{.mark} or engagement in war]{.underline}. [Its
pragmatist perspective steers in a different direction from the antiwar
feminists\' \"practical\" opposition to war]{.underline}. Whereas the
realist tradition has been unduly pessimistic in its assumption that war
and armed conflict are necessary, certain, and inevitable, on a
pragmatist feminist view, [[antiwar feminist thinking tends to
be]{.underline} [**unduly optimistic** about the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[human [capacity to transcend]{.mark} the use of [violent
methods]{.mark} of resolving disputes]{.underline}, given the consistent
and continual resort to such means throughout most of human history.
[From a pragmatist feminist perspective]{.underline}, the
[[historical]{.mark} and contemporary [experience of]{.mark} the
[repeated resort to violence and]{.mark} the [inability]{.mark} of
humanity]{.underline} thus far [[to develop alternative
mechanisms]{.mark} for resolving large-scale disputes [suggests the
likelihood of future]{.mark}]{.underline} wars and [[armed
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}. In light of this history,
[**[overcoming]{.mark} the \"[war culture]{.mark}**\" that antiwar
feminists view so unfavorably [can be possible **only outside the
immediate situation of armed conflict**. Once the aggressor has struck
or threatens to]{.mark} do so imminently]{.underline}, **[[it is too
late to change our societies and ourselves]{.mark} in order [to avoid
war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Rather, [[it is]{.mark} then [necessary to
act]{.mark} in order [to **avoid annihilation**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
one form or another. Given its view that some wars and some opposition
to war and armed conflicts are morally necessary to protect ourselves
and others from harm, pragmatist feminists seek to impose moral limits
on the harm and suffering to the minimum necessary. Despite an awareness
of its limitations,22 a pragmatist feminist perspective considers just
war theory to provide a flexible and modifiable set of criteria for
attempting to act morally and in accordance with principles of justice,
both in entering into an armed conflict (jus ad bellum) and in the
actual engagement of that conflict (jus in bello). In particular,
pragmatist feminism shares just war\'s starting premise of a strong
presumption against the legitimacy of the use of armed force and
violence to resolve conflicts. [[A pragmatist feminist
perspective]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [**[rejects Cohn\'s and Ruddick\'s
contention]{.mark}** that justwar [theorists]{.mark}]{.underline}
\"implicitly **[[accept war as a practice even when condemning
particular wars]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\"23 [[Recognizing the]{.mark}
historical and global [reality of war]{.mark}]{.underline} making and
armed force [as means of resolving conflicts [and **adopting strategies
to**]{.mark} **maximize justice and [minimize immorality]{.mark}** [when
such means are adopted **is not the same as**]{.mark} **\"implicitly
[accepting the practices of war]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" at least [in
the absence of **demonstrably effective means of eliminating such
conflicts**. [To ignore the reality of]{.mark} the [continuing resort to
war]{.mark}]{.underline} and armed force [[is]{.mark} itself [to revert
to **abstraction** **rather than**]{.mark} offering **[a practical
method for eliminating]{.mark}**]{.underline} the **[human
[suffering]{.mark}]{.underline}** and incalculable damage [caused by
war]{.underline} and armed conflict. Here [Colin and Ruddick
reveal]{.underline} (intentionally or otherwise) [their situatedness as
citizens of a war-making state]{.underline}, one that has had the choice
in many, if not all, instances since the mid-twentieth century, at
least, of deciding whether or not to go to war. [Just as [Cohn and
Ruddick]{.mark} criticize just war theory]{.underline} for failing to
explore nonviolent alternatives once a just cause is determined or war
has begun, [**their [antiwar feminist approach fails to offer concrete
suggestions for avoiding armed conflict]{.mark}** when a
nation]{.underline} or people [is confronted with armed aggression or
assault by others]{.underline}, the situation [where the options boil
down to \"**fight or die**.\" [This perspective **fails to look at war
from the point of view of the aggressed-against**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[when]{.underline}]{.mark} [armed [conflict becomes a
necessity]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to retain national and/or
cultural and/or ethnic identity from subjugation by the aggressor(s).
[In such circumstances, the moral necessity of armed force looks quite
different]{.underline}. And in such circumstances, [the [**threatened**
use of WMD can be]{.mark} seen as **[less evil than]{.mark}** the
**[alternatives]{.mark}**, such as **[doing
nothing]{.mark}**]{.underline} and being conquered **[[or fighting
a]{.mark} conventional [war and faring poorly]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Rather than reverting to abstract thinking about war, pragmatist
feminism affirms just war theory\'s casuistic approach to particular
armed conflicts as well as its position that such means are sometimes
morally justifiable or even morally obligator)\' in order to protect
oneself (individual or nation) or innocent third parties. Further,
[[pragmatist feminism affirms]{.underline}]{.mark} just war thinking\'s
[[**attention to particular conflicts rather than war in the abstract**
and]{.mark} its stance of moderation and of **[imposing]{.mark}** the
**[minimal suffering]{.mark}**]{.underline} necessary to accomplish the
objective of restoring the peace.24 Thus, with respect to the military
response of the United States to the September 11 terrorist attacks, a
pragmatist feminist application of just war criteria yields the
conclusion that the jus ad bellum principles of \"last resort\" and
\"proportionality,\" as well as the in hello principles of
\"proportionality\" and \"discrimination,\" were not satisfied. [A
second [difference]{.mark}]{.underline} in the two feminist perspectives
[[emerges out of the]{.mark} antiwar feminist [observation]{.mark} that
[war and militarism are not separate from everyday
life]{.mark}]{.underline} but integral aspects of it.25 [While
[this]{.mark} is]{.underline} an extremely [important]{.underline}
insight into the underlying conditions of war and militarism, [it [needs
to be joined with]{.mark} **alternative [proposals for
addressing]{.mark} the [\"large-scale military conflict]{.mark}**[.\"
There has been scant attention to this]{.mark} issue [in antiwar
feminist scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Even if one
assumes]{.underline}]{.mark}, as antiwar feminists do, [that [war is a
\"presence\" in everyday life]{.mark} and not merely a discrete
\"event\"]{.underline} that occasionally \"erupts,\"26 [[it is]{.mark}
nonetheless [the case that \"**war\" is more damaging and harmful, and
creates greater suffering in a multiplicity of ways**]{.mark}, than the
absence of war. [Pragmatist feminist thinking]{.mark}]{.underline} about
the ethics of WMD [[is **attentive to how such differences in
consequences** differentiate war from "everyday
life]{.underline}]{.mark}." A third significant area of difference
between the two types of feminist theories concerns responses to the
causes of war. Whereas pragmatist feminists agree with antiwar feminists
that wars are partially a mutual construction, they also insist that
some wars have much more to do with unjust aggression for which opposing
sides do not share equal responsibility. Antiwar feminism fails to
accept that some wars are not only necessary as a matter of prudence,
but also morally justifiable *on feminist grounds*, for example,
humanitarian intervention to end the severe oppression of innocent
victims. [[For a pragmatist feminist]{.mark}, the [current]{.mark} state
of [international affairs]{.mark}]{.underline} unfortunately
[[**requires** consideration of the circumstances in which the
**threatened**]{.underline}]{.mark} or actual [**[use of]{.mark} such
[weapons for]{.mark} defensive or [deterrent purposes]{.mark}** [may
be]{.mark}]{.underline} morally allowable or even **[[morally
necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Given these circumstances, pragmatist
feminism considers the just war tradition to provide a morally useful
source of norms relating to the use of weapons in war.

**Zero empirical correlation between innate drives or social
institutions and war -- the only way to prevent conflict empirically is
to look at the specific decision calculus of national leaders**

[While classical liberals focused on political structures, socialists
analyzed the socioeconomic system of states as the primary factor in
determining the propensity of states to engage in war.]{.underline}
Socialists such as Karl Marx attributed war to the class structure of
society; Marx believed that war resulted from a clash of social forces
created by a capitalist mode of production that develops two
antagonistic classes, rather than being an instrument of state policy.
Thus capitalist states would engage in war because of their growing
needs for raw materials, markets, and cheap labor. Socialists believed
replacing capitalism with socialism could prevent war, but world events
have proven socialists wrong as well. 32 [These two schools of
thought---[war is caused by]{.mark} innate [biological drives or social
institutions---do not demonstrate any meaningful correlation
with]{.mark} the [occurrence]{.mark} or nonoccurrence [of war. There are
many variables not considered]{.mark}]{.underline} by these two schools:
[for example, the influence of national [special interest groups]{.mark}
such as the military or defense contractors that may seek glory through
victory, greater [resources]{.mark}, greater [domestic political
power]{.mark}, or justification for their existence.]{.underline} Legal
scholar Quincy [[Wright]{.mark} has [conducted one of the "most thorough
studies of]{.mark} the nature of [war]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} 33
[[and concludes]{.mark} that [there "is no single cause]{.mark} of
war.]{.underline}" 34 In A Study of War, h[e concludes that [peace is an
equilibrium of]{.mark} four complex factors: military and industrial
[technology]{.mark}, international [law]{.mark} governing the resort to
war, social and [political organization]{.mark} at the domestic and
international level, [and]{.mark} the distribution of [attitudes]{.mark}
and opinions concerning basic values]{.underline}. War is likely when
controls on any one level are disturbed or changed. 35 Similarly, the
1997 US National Military Strategy identifies the root causes of
conflict as political, economic, social, and legal conditions. 36
[[Moore has compiled the following]{.mark} list of conventional
[explanations for war: specific disputes]{.mark}; absence of dispute
[settlement mechanisms; ideological disputes; ethnic]{.mark} and
religious [differences; communication]{.mark} failures;
[proliferation]{.mark} of weapons and arms races; social and economic
[injustice; imbalance of power]{.mark}; competition for
[resources]{.mark}; incidents, [accidents]{.mark}, and miscalculation;
[violence i]{.mark}n the [nature]{.mark} of man; [aggressive]{.mark}
national [leaders; and economic determination]{.mark}]{.underline}. He
has concluded, however, that these causes or motives for war explain
specific conflicts but fail to serve as a central paradigm for
explaining the cause of war. 37 In the final analysis, [[Wright is
unequivocally correct]{.mark}---there is no single cause or explanation
for war. [However, there is one clear consistency in all wars: wars
always begin through]{.mark} the [calculated decisions]{.mark} of men or
women]{.underline}, regardless of any cause, motive, or explanation. As
the UNESCO constitution asserts, "wars begin in the minds of men." 38
[People---national leaders--- are always at the core of any decision to
wage war, and any strategy for preventing war must address these
individuals]{.underline}.

**The lack of deterrence is the most reliable predictor of war --
instead of focusing on root causes, we should look to variables that
directly affect decision-making, and deterrence is the most important
factor**

Wars are not simply accidents. Nor, contrary to our ordinary language,
are they made by nations. [[Wars are]{.underline}]{.mark} made by
people; more specifically they are [[decided]{.mark} on [by]{.mark} the
[leaders o]{.mark}f nation [states]{.mark}]{.underline}---and other
nonnational groups in the case of terrorism---[who make the decision to
commit aggression or otherwise use the military instrument]{.underline}.
[[These leaders make that decision based on the totality of
incentives]{.mark} affecting them at the time of the
decision]{.underline}. . . . Incentive theory\] tells us that we simply
have a better chance of\] . . . predicting war, and fashioning forms of
intervention to control it, if we focus squarely on the effect of
variables from all levels of analysis in generating incentives affecting
the actual decisions made by those with the power to decide on war. 42
[[Incentive theory focuses on the]{.mark} individual [decisions that
lead to war and explains the]{.mark} synergistic [relationship
between]{.mark} the [absence of]{.mark} effective [deterrence and the
absence of democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Together [these three
factors---the decisions of leaders made without the restraining effects
of deterrence and democracy--- are the cause of war:]{.underline} War is
not strictly caused by an absence of democracy or effective deterrence
or both together. Rather war is caused by the human leadership decision
to employ the military instrument. [[The absence of democracy, the
absence of effective deterrence, and most importantly, the synergy
of]{.mark} an absence of [both are conditions]{.mark} or factors [that
predispose to war]{.mark}]{.underline}. An absence of democracy likely
predisposes by \[its\] effect on leadership and leadership incentives,
and an absence of effective deterrence likely predisposes by its effect
on incentives from factors other than the individual or governmental
levels of analysis. [[To understand the cause of war is to understand
the human decision for war]{.mark}; that is, major war and democide . .
. are the consequence of individual decisions responding to a totality
of incentives.]{.underline} 43

[WE SHOULD congratulate the Science Museum for setting up an exhibition
on psychoanalysis. Exposure to pseudoscience]{.underline} greatly h[elps
understand genuine science, just as learning about tyranny helps in
understanding democracy.]{.underline} [[Over]{.mark} the past [30 years,
**psychoanalysis has**]{.mark} quietly **[been displaced]{.mark}** in
academia [by scientific psychology. But it persists in popular
culture]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as being a lucrative profession.
[It is the psychology of those who have not bothered to learn
psychology]{.underline}, and the psychotherapy of choice for those who
believe in the power of immaterial mind over body. [**[Psychoanalysis is
a bogus science]{.mark}** because **[its practitioners do not do
scientific research]{.mark}**]{.underline}. When the field turned 100, a
group of [[psychoanalysts admitted this gap]{.mark} and endeavoured to
fill it. They [claimed to have performed the first
experiment]{.mark}]{.underline} showing that patients benefited from
their treatment. Regrettably, **[[they did not include a control group
and did not entertain]{.mark} the possibility of [placebo
effects]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Hence, [their claim remains
untested]{.mark}]{.underline} (The International Journal of
Psychoanalysis, vol 81, p 513). More recently, a meta-analysis published
in American Psychologist (vol 65, p 98) purported to support the claim
that a form of psychoanalysis called psychodynamic therapy is effective.
However, once again, the original studies did not involve control
groups. [In [110 years, psychoanalysts have not set up a single
lab]{.mark}. They do not participate in scientific
congresses,]{.underline} do not submit their papers to scientific
journals and are foreign to the scientific community - [[a marginality
typical of pseudoscience]{.underline}]{.mark}. This does not mean
[[their hypotheses]{.underline}]{.mark} have never been put to the test.
True, they [are [so vague that they are hard to test and]{.mark} some of
them]{.underline} [are]{.underline}, by Freud\'s own admission,
[irrefutable]{.underline}. Still, [most of [the testable ones have been
soundly refuted]{.mark}]{.underline}. [For example, most dreams have no
sexual content. The Oedipus complex is a myth]{.underline}; boys do not
hate their fathers because they would like to have sex with their
mothers. [The list goes on.]{.underline} As for therapeutic efficacy,
little is known because psychoanalysts do not perform double-blind
clinical trials or follow-up studies. Psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience.
Its concepts are woolly and untestable yet are regarded as unassailable
axioms. As a result of such dogmatism, [[psychoanalysis]{.mark} has
[remained]{.mark} basically [stagnant]{.mark} for more than a century,
[in contrast with scientific psychology, which is
thriving.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**Psychoanalysis has zero [logical]{.underline} or
[empirical]{.underline} basis, can't be scaled up, and totalizes the
existence of the human condition in pseudoscientific terms**

By his own admission, [[Stavrakakis **does not provide
blueprints**]{.underline}]{.mark} (which is unsurprising), [nor does he
provide]{.underline} prescriptions, [political direction]{.underline} or
policy proposals (pp. 13-14, 30). [[This leaves the work of **dubious
relevance to people doing politics**]{.underline}]{.mark} whether as
activists, politicians or administrators. The aim is rather to argue for
radical democracy as \'the institutionalization of a mechanism which
enables the continuous re-articulation of the symbolic field
constituting society\' (p. 129). The author makes very broad claims
about this function of democracy, which is \'the most pressing task\' of
politics (p. 60), the only way to ensure permanent creation of the new
(p. 60) and the only legitimate form of hegemony (p. 256). [[The
argumentation backing up these claims]{.mark} mostly [amounts
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**assertion**]{.mark} and
exegesis]{.underline}. However, this is not simply a case for existing
liberal democracies. Radical democracy is contrasted with existing
democracies (pp. 255-256) and is taken to imply a change in the
arrangement of jouissance . Instead of the fantasies pervasive today,
typified by their blaming of the other for the incompleteness of the
self, Stavrakakis proposes a passage to feminine jouissance that
encircles the lack (pp. 22-23, 111, 144, 268, 278-279). Present
democracies have been hit by an assault on the two pillars of modern
democracy \-- equality and liberty \-- by the neoliberals and
neoconservatives, respectively, leading to a \'post-political\' world in
which conflict is avoided and thus returns as social problems, and in
which a new, almost pre-democratic despotism is taking shape (pp.
263-264). Despite this, democracy can still function as \'the mobilising
force, the common denominator, for a politics of alternatives\' (p.
258).

[These political conclusions are dubious]{.underline}. Liberal
democracies in fact tend to be quite closed to change and to be
supplemented with aggressive nationalist and racist identities. The
liberal state, like the authoritarian state, tends to essentialize
itself as a form in such a way as to deny its own contingency. It is not
clear that the radical democratic framework guarantees basic rights or
prevents the state from making essentialist claims on others.
Stavrakakis assumes that the democratic form itself directly achieves
the goal of recognizing contingency (p. 141). Yet this cannot be the
case, since as Stavrakakis admits, this form does not prevent actually
existing democracies from being inflected with fantasmatic projects such
as ultranationalism, or degenerating into a \'post-political\' disavowal
of conflict. Further, whichever party gets in power \-- by majority will
or procedural hitch \-- is generally able to ignore intransigent
realities, pursue its own fantasmatic actings-out and repress,
foreclose, disavow or otherwise silence whatever forms of social
otherness are not to its tastes. Beyond this, there is a fantasmatic
frame of the liberal-democratic state that pits the permanent
institutions such as the police, bureaucracy and secret service against
semi-permanent Others, hence displacing real social antagonisms into
narratives of \'crime\', \'disorder\', \'terrorism\', \'madness\',
\'anarchy\' and so on. [[Can this]{.mark} fundamental [fantasy be
traversed without **shattering the frame of the**]{.mark}]{.underline}
\'democratic\' **[[state]{.mark} itself?]{.underline}** One might also
wonder if the \'politics of alternatives\' has not already emerged \--
and passed by entirely the radical democrats \-- in the form of the
anti-capitalist and anti-neoliberal movements.

[The linking of Lacanian theory to liberal democracy seems just too
convenient. One cannot but be reminded of the Soviet-era dissidents
whose [critiques of]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[the [**existing
regimes** ended up **reproducing** them in **their**]{.mark} proposed
**[alternatives]{.mark}**]{.underline} \-- [hence [operating as
the]{.mark} fantasmatic [supplement of the regimes
themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}. Surely a full acceptance of social
contingency would generate social relations radically different from
those pertaining in a society where such acceptance has not occurred.
Acceptance of contingency might, for instance, necessitate the
elimination of punishment, which involves a fantasy frame blaming the
other (the criminal) for social conflict and risk; it would instead
require that risk be assumed by all social actors and not displaced into
special \'exceptional\' spaces. It would seem to imply that the state
needs to be constrained from the outside by other institutions, that a
social order where power is negotiated or contested among multiple
institutions is better than one where a single site monopolizes the
field of social power. Or maybe it would be better served by the
fluidity of affinity and the looseness of custom than by the fixity of
state and law. Perhaps the revival of activities inscribing agonism and
difference emerge, not inside the state, but in societal relations,
oppositional movements and everyday life.

While the Lacanianism of the title is self-explanatory, it raises
another problem \-- why the \'left\' in \'Lacanian left\'? Stavrakakis
defines \'left\' as meaning a democratic legitimation of antagonism and
\'alternatives\' (p. 30), a definition that begs the question,
identifying the \'left\' directly with Lacanianism. This is pretty much
unrecognizable in relation to general usage, in which \'left\' is
generally associated with the welfare or self-assertion of the
worst-off, and the prioritizing of substantive social issues over
property, propriety and order. Is Lacanian theory really \'left\' in
this more usual sense? It is, on Stavrakakis\'s own admission,
\'subversive\' rather than \'revolutionary\' (pp. 2, 158) and has a
\'reformist direction\' (p. 109). What this means in concrete terms is
that the structural frame is taken as unchangeable but the elements
within it can be reshuffled. \'Exclusion and antagonism may be
unavoidable, but acknowledging this does not restrict our ability to
influence their particular articulations, to displace continuously the
limits they impose\' (p. 226). Again in common with other \'radical
democrats\', Stavrakakis says little to reassure either the excluded or
included of the present that they will not be the losers of such a
reshuffling; it is unclear as to who will be excluded in this process,
and indeed, if any one exclusion can be deemed ethically worse than any
other. At best it is possible that the presently marginalized could come
out on top from such reshuffling. However, this is not the main aim of
Lacanian theory, which has more to do with the recognition of
contingency, rejection of \'utopianism\' and defence of
liberal-democratic regimes \-- of the \'situationness\', or ordering as
such, of society, along with its \'eventness\' or the recurrence of
radical acts (pp. 156-157). This leads to assertions of the need for
hierarchical power. For instance, authority is taken as inevitable in
all social situations; it is \'a frame presupposed in every social
experience\' (p. 173). \'Without someone in command reality
disintegrates\' (p. 174). Such an orientation has a long history, but it
is a history of the right, not the left, associated particularly with
anti-communist liberals such as Popper, Kolakowski and Berlin, and
traceable to the classical liberalism of authors such as Jefferson, de
Tocqueville and J.S. Mill, who viewed constitutionality, political
pluralism and a competitive \'marketplace of ideas\' as necessary to
impede the totalitarian tendencies of any one perspective taken alone.
Contingency, anti-utopianism, a humble acceptance of limits to knowledge
and action, the primacy of lack in human experience, are all paralleled
in this older tradition. \<\<\<Continues next page\>\>\>

The strengths and weaknesses of the text largely follow from the
usefulness and limits of the perspective it provides. [The [Lacanian
perspective]{.mark}]{.underline}, as a partial truth, [certainly
provides interesting insights and a different way of
seeing]{.underline}, and [as such often generates productive
contributions]{.underline}. However, [it [fails]{.mark} drastically
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[understand the **partiality of its own
\'truth\'**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In Stavrakakis\'s words, lack can\'t
be signified but it can be formalized (p. 279). In other words, a final
map of the structure of reality can still, from this perspective, be
drawn \-- and has been drawn already by Lacan. In effect, the [result is
a claim to be the theoretical end of]{.underline} [history \-- all else
is utopian, essentialist and so on.]{.underline} In many respects, [[the
perspective is]{.mark} also [reactive]{.mark}]{.underline}, [defined by
what it is against]{.underline} (anti-essentialist, anti-utopian,
anti-fantasmatic). **[[It is less clear what it is
for]{.underline}]{.mark}** \-- although the idea of feminine jouissance
begins the task of constructing a positive pole. [[Its relation to the
other is **very intolerant**]{.mark} and dismissive. [It is not open to
other voices]{.mark} [because it is always ready to judge the other as
failing its]{.mark} own rigid [internal criteria]{.mark}. [It expresses
a dangerous urge to drive the other out of]{.mark} the
community]{.underline} of speakers, [and perhaps out of
[existence]{.mark}]{.underline} altogether. The chapter on Castoriadis
is symptomatic here. Castoriadis in many ways stands for the entire
field of horizontalist radicalism \-- horizontalists and immanentists
(Stirner, Reich, Negri, Deleuze, Marcuse, various critics of Lacan)
circle around the text like barbarians at the gates. The dispute between
Lacanianism and horizontalism is a dispute the stakes of which Lacanians
are reluctant to confront, instead hiding behind the view from one side
\-- \'they disagree with us, therefore they are wrong\'. Except that
\'wrong\' is usually replaced by one of a number of theoretical epithets
\-- romantic, utopian, essentialist \-- which sound superficially like
useful categories of theory but which are never defined and which serve
mainly as a name to call people who disagree with one or another basic
Lacanian assumption. The impression is given that those who hold these
perspectives are somehow naïve, intellectually disreputable or
unrespectable, but this connoted claim is never demonstrated. It is
simply a choice of one perspective over another, conveyed in loaded
language. Like most of its ilk, [this book does plenty to show what
Lacanian theory does]{.underline}, how it \'works\' as a theoretical
machine or toolkit, [but rather less to say why it]{.underline} [should
be preferred to other approaches]{.underline} (assuming, of course, that
not wanting to be called names is insufficient reason to accept its
validity). [[Lacanian theory]{.underline} [suffers from an **ontological
and epistemological restrictiveness** derived from its absolutizing
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [structural [topologies, which **limits its
explanatory power** by]{.mark}]{.underline} [[rendering]{.mark} far too
many [specificities]{.mark} of metropolitan statist societies
\'necessary\' or [\'unavoidable\']{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The theory
involves]{.underline}]{.mark} [restrictive, totalizing [claims that
are]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**neither logically**]{.mark} necessary
**[nor empirically demonstrated]{.mark}**; most often, acceptance of
such claims is unnecessary to gain the benefits of the explanatorily
or]{.underline} [theoretically useful aspects of the perspective. Social
phenomena vary in how well they fit this limiting frame. Nationalism and
racism, having the right form, fit well, and hence become favourite
expository targets for Lacanian theorists. But [dogmas will have to be
sacrificed if a broader]{.mark} field of [social]{.mark}
[movement]{.mark}s [is to be encompassed.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**Even if they win superior explanatory power, psychoanalytic imaginings
are useless in advancing political change**

On the other hand, though in these ways and many others, [psychoanalysis
seems to promote the sorts of subjective dispositions and habits
requisite for a thriving democracy, and though in a variety of ways
psychoanalysis contributes to personal emancipation]{.underline}--- say,
[by releasing individuals from self-defeating, damaging, or petrified
forms action and reaction, object attachment, and the
like]{.underline}---[in light of the very uniqueness of what it has to
offer, one cannot but wonder: [to what extent]{.mark}, if at all,
[can]{.mark} the habits and dispositions---broadly, the forms of
life---cultivated by [psychoanalytic practice]{.mark} survive, let alone
[flourish, under]{.mark} **modern social and [political
conditions]{.mark}**[?]{.mark}]{.underline} [[If the]{.mark}
emancipatory [inclinations]{.mark}]{.underline} and democratic virtues
that [psychoanalytic practice promotes [are]{.mark} systematically
[crushed]{.mark}]{.underline} or at least regularly unsupported by the
world in which they would be realized, [**then [isn't
psychoanalysis]{.mark} implicitly** [making promises it cannot
redeem?]{.mark}]{.underline} Might not massive social and political
transformations be the condition for the efficacious practice of
psychoanalysis? And so, under current conditions, [can we avoid
experiencing the forms of life nascently cultivated by psychoanalytic
practice as something of a tease, or even a source of deep
frustration]{.underline}? (2) Concerning psychoanalysis as a politically
inclined theoretical enterprise, [[the worry is whether
political]{.mark} diagnoses and [proposals]{.mark} that proceed
[on]{.mark} the basis of [psychoanalytic insights]{.mark} and forms of
attention [partake of a fantasy of]{.mark} interpretive [efficacy (**all
the world's a couch**]{.mark}]{.underline}, you might say), [wherein our
profound alienation from the conditions for robust political agency are
registered and repudiated]{.underline}? Consider, for example, Freud and
Bullitt's (1967) assessment of the psychosexual determinants of Woodrow
Wilson's political aspirations and impediments, or Reich's (1972)
suggestion that Marxism should appeal to psychoanalysis in order to
illuminate and redress neurotic phenomena that generate disturbances in
working capacity, especially as this concerns religion and bourgeois
sexual ideology. Also relevant are Freud's,
[[Žižek's]{.underline}]{.mark} (1993, 2004), Derrida's (2002) and
others' insistence that we draw the juridical and political consequences
of the [hypothesis of an irreducible [death drive]{.mark}]{.underline},
as well as Marcuse's (1970) proposal that we attend to the weakening of
Eros and the growth of aggression that [[results]{.mark} [from]{.mark}
the coercive [enforcement of the reality principle]{.mark} upon the
sociopolitically weakened ego, and especially to the channeling of this
aggression into hatred of enemies.]{.underline} Reich (1972) and Fromm
(1932) suggest that psychoanalysis be employed to explore the
motivations to political irrationality, especially that singular
irrationality of joining the national-socialist movement, while Irigaray
(1985) diagnoses the desire for the Same, the One, the Phallus as a
desire for a sociosymbolic order that assures masculine dominance. Žižek
(2004) contends that only a psychoanalytic exposition of the disavowed
beliefs and suppositions of the United States political elite can get at
the fundamental determinants of the Iraq War. Rose (1993) argues that it
was the paranoiac paradox of sensing both that there is every reason to
be frightened and that everything is under control that allowed Thatcher
"to make this paradox the basis of political identity so that subjects
could take pleasure in violence as force and legitimacy while always
locating 'real' violence somewhere else---illegitimate violence and
illicitness increasingly made subject to the law" (p. 64).
[[Stavrakakis]{.mark}]{.underline} (1999) [[advocates that
we]{.underline}]{.mark} recognize and [[traverse
the]{.underline}]{.mark} residues of [[utopian
fantasy]{.underline}]{.mark} in our contemporary political imagination.1
[Might not the psychoanalytic [interpretation of powerful
figures]{.mark} (Bush, Bin Laden, or whomever), collective subjects
(nations, ethnic groups, and so forth), [or]{.mark} urgent ["political"
situations **register** ]{.mark}**an [anxiety]{.mark} regarding
political impotence** or "castration" that is **pacified and modified**
by the fantasmatic frame [wherein the psychoanalytically
inclined]{.mark} political [theorist situates]{.mark} him- or herself
[as diagnosing]{.mark} or interpretively intervening in the lives of
political figures]{.underline}, collective political subjects, [or
complex political [situations]{.mark} with the idealized efficacy of a
successful clinical intervention]{.underline}? If so, then [**the
question is: [are the contributions of psychoanalytic]{.mark}ally
inclined political [theory anything more than tantalizing menu]{.mark}
cards [for ]{.mark}**[meals it cannot deliver**?**]{.mark}]{.underline}
As I said, the worry is twofold. These are two folds of a related
problem, which is this: [might the very seductiveness of psychoanalytic
theory and practice]{.underline}---specifically, the seductiveness of
its political promise---[register the lasting eclipse of the political
and the objectivity of the social, respectively]{.underline}? In other
words, [[might not every**thing that makes psychoanalytic**]{.mark}
**theory and [practice]{.mark} so politically [attractive]{.mark}**
[indicate]{.mark} precisely the necessity of wide-ranging
social/institutional [transformations that far exceed the powers of
psychoanalysis]{.mark}]{.underline}[?]{.mark} And so, [might not the
politically salient [transformations]{.mark} of subjectivity [to which
psychoanalysis can contribute overburden subjectivity as the]{.mark}
site of [political transformation, **blinding us to** ]{.mark}**the
necessity of largescale [institutional reforms]{.mark}**]{.underline}?
Indeed, might not massive institutional transformations be necessary
conditions for the efficacy of psychoanalytic practice, both personally
and politically? Further, [might not the so-called interventions and
proposals of psychoanalytically inclined political [theory]{.mark}
similarly [sidestep the question of the institutional]{.mark}
transformations [necessary for]{.mark} their [realization, and]{.mark}
so [conspire with]{.mark} our blindness to the enormous institutional
[impediments to a]{.mark} progressive [political
future?]{.mark}]{.underline}

**Psychoanalytic explanations of racism are reductionist,
non-falsifiable and anti-political**

**[Gordon 1]{.mark}**---psychotherapist living and working in London
(Paul, Psychoanalysis and Racism: The politics of defeat Race & Class v.
42, n. 4)

[[Given that racism works at an unconscious level, it
follows]{.underline}]{.mark}, in Cohen\'s¶ view, [[that strategies to
challenge it at a conscious level are doomed]{.mark} to]{.underline}¶
[failure.]{.underline} They are bound to fail precisely because they are
rational and¶ fail to appreciate that the power of racism lies in the
fact that it is¶ unconscious. To deinstitutionalise racism \`will not in
itself abolish¶ the power of the racist imagination\' which will
continue to flourish¶ through the media of popular culture long after
its state forms have¶ withered away.42 \`All the evidence to date\',
Cohen writes elsewhere,¶ \`shows that the racist imagination is not
accessible to rationalist¶ pedagogies, and almost effortlessly resists
their impact\'. [[What is all]{.underline}]{.mark}¶ [[this evidence?
Certainly it is neither presented nor cited]{.underline}]{.mark}.43
Rustin,¶ too, claims that classroom teaching can have the effect of
\`increasing¶ kinds of defensive organisation\'. But he cites no
evidence - other¶ than referring to Cohen\'s work - and seems to believe
that all \`antiracism\'¶ in education is a matter of seeking to change
attitudes, rather¶ than opening up new ways of looking at the world.44¶
In Cohen\'s schema, then, [[racism is taken out of society]{.mark} and
material]{.underline}¶ [reality [and lodged very firmly in the
minds]{.mark}, the unconscious minds, [of]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶
[individual subjects]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although in his 1988 article,
\`The perversions of¶ inheritance\', he distanced himself from a
position that afforded¶ absolute autonomy to the ideological, and thus
ran the risk, as he¶ acknowledged, of \`substituting changes in personal
attitude or societal¶ values for structural reforms\', this is, in fact,
where he has ended up.¶ As his work has developed, **[[there is less and
less sense of any]{.underline}]{.mark}**¶ **[[political project of
anti-racism]{.underline}]{.mark}** and an almost exclusive
concentration¶ on dealing with the beliefs and attitudes of racists.
Ideology has¶ become all.¶ [In placing racism in the
unconscious]{.underline}, [Cohen is]{.underline} very much [in
line]{.underline}¶ [with]{.underline} [the most orthodox of
psychoanalysis which claims to find]{.underline}¶ \`[inside\'
individuals]{.underline} (whatever that might mean - the notion of an
\`internal¶ world\' is always taken for granted and never really put
into question)¶ [what actually belongs in society, in what
psychoanalysis calls]{.underline}¶ \`[the external world]{.underline}\'.
Indeed, one of the earliest Marxist critiques of¶ Freud\'s theories made
precisely this point, accusing Freud of rendering¶ individual what was
irredeemably social.45 In the same vein, and particularly¶ germane to
the present discussion, the refusal of psychoanalysis¶ to acknowledge
social and political reality, to see what is in front of it, is¶
exemplified in the following story.¶ Like many analysts of her time,
Melanie Klein, in whose tradition¶ Cohen writes, engaged in the quite
unethical and inappropriate practice¶ of analysing her own children. She
began her son Erich\'s analysis in¶ Budapest in 1920 when he was 5 and
continued it when she separated¶ from her husband and moved to Berlin.
There, Erich developed a¶ phobia about going outside. Klein
\`explained\' to Erich that his anxiety¶ was due to his fantasies about
having sexual intercourse with his¶ mother. Erich told his mother of a
street that was particularly frightening¶ to him because it was filled
with young \`toughs\' who tormented him.¶ Klein ignored this and,
recalling that the street was filled with large¶ trees, interpreted
these as phalluses and evidence of his continued¶ desire for his mother
and of his fear of castration as a punishment.¶ Years later, Erich\'s
elder brother Hans, also an analysand of his¶ mother, told Erich that
the youths had, in fact, been an anti-Semitic¶ gang that routinely
attacked Jewish children. Erich had never been¶ told by his mother that
he was Jewish. As the historian of psychotherapy¶ Philip Cushman
comments: \`It is difficult to know what is¶ more remarkable in this
incident with Erich: Klein\'s dismissal of, her¶ almost phobic denial
of, the \`\`external\'\' social realm, or her remarkable¶
self-centredness.\' 46 [Klein]{.underline}, in other words, [placed in
the mind of her son]{.underline}¶ [that which fully belonged in the
material world. [Objective reality]{.mark}]{.underline}¶ [[became a
\`state of mind\'. Exactly the same criticism can be
levelled]{.underline}¶ [at]{.underline}]{.mark} Cohen\'s
[[placing]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[racism inside the unconscious minds
of individuals]{.underline}]{.mark}.¶ It is indeed ironic that, with
postmodernists such as Cohen,¶ we should be witnessing a return to a
past - albeit at a more sophisticated¶ level of \`discourse\' - when,
according to the liberal race relations¶ paradigm, racism did not really
exist, only racial prejudice, something¶ that was individual and
psychological.¶ The question of method¶ Cohen\'s work unavoidably raises
the question of the status of psychoanalysis¶ as a social or political
theory, as distinct from a clinical one.¶ Can psychoanalysis, in other
words, apply to the social world of groups, institutions, nations,
states and cultures in the way that it does,¶ or at least may do, to
individuals? Certainly there is now a considerable¶ body of literature
and a plethora of academic courses, and so on, claiming¶ that
psychoanalysis is a social theory. And, of course, in popular¶
discourse, it is now a commonplace to hear of nations and societies¶
spoken of in personalised ways. Thus \`truth commissions\' and the¶
like, which have become so common in the past decade in countries¶ which
have undergone turbulent change, are seen as forms of national¶ therapy
or catharsis, even if this is far from being their purpose.
Nevertheless,¶ the question remains: [does it make sense]{.underline},
as Michael Ignatieff¶ puts it, [to speak of nations having psyches the
way that individuals do?]{.underline}¶ \`Can a nation\'s past make
people ill as we know repressed memories¶ sometimes make individuals
ill? . . . Can we speak of nations \`\`working¶ through\'\' a civil war
or an atrocity as we speak of individuals working¶ through a traumatic
memory or event?\' 47¶ [[The problem with the application of
psychoanalysis to social institutions]{.underline}¶ [is that there can
be no testing]{.underline}]{.mark} [of the claims made]{.underline}. If
someone says,¶ for instance, that nationalism is a form of looking for
and seeking to¶ replace the body of the mother one has lost, or that the
popular¶ appeal of a particular kind of story echoes the pattern of our
earliest¶ relationship to the maternal breast, [how can this be
proved?]{.underline} The¶ pioneers of psychoanalysis, from Freud
onwards, all derived their¶ ideas in the context of their work with
individual patients and their¶ ideas can be examined in the everyday
laboratory of the therapeutic¶ encounter where the validity of an
interpretation, for example, is a¶ matter for dialogue between therapist
and patient. [Outside of the consulting]{.underline}¶ [room, [there can
be no]{.mark} [such verification]{.mark} process, [and the
further]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶ [one moves from the individual patient,
the less purchase psychoanalytic]{.underline}¶ [ideas can
have]{.underline}]{.mark}[. Outside the therapeutic encounter,
anything]{.underline}¶ [and everything can be true, psychoanalytically
speaking. But if everything]{.underline}¶ [is true, then nothing can be
false and therefore nothing can be]{.underline}¶ [true.]{.underline}¶ An
example of Cohen\'s method is to be found in his 1993 working¶ paper,
\`Home rules\', subtitled \`Some reflections on racism and nationalism¶
in everyday life\'. Here Cohen talks about taking a \`particular line¶
of thought for a walk\'. While there is nothing wrong with taking a
line¶ of thought for a walk, such an exercise is not necessarily the
same as¶ thinking. One of the problems with Cohen\'s approach is that a
kind¶ of free association, mixed with deconstruction, leads not to
analysis,¶ not even to psychoanalysis, but to\... well, just more free
association,¶ an endless, indeed one might say pointless, play on words.
This¶ approach may well throw up some interesting associations along
the¶ way, connections one had never thought of but it is not to be
confused¶ with political analysis. In \`Home rules\', anything and
everything to do¶ with \`home\' can and does find a place here and, as I
indicated above, even the popular film Home Alone is pressed into
service as a story¶ about \`racial\' invasion.¶ Cohen\'s method also
relies to no little extent on various caricatures.¶ There is the parody
of an undifferentiated anti-racism which is always¶ crude and simplistic
in its explanations, always dogmatic and authoritarian¶ in its
prescriptions. \`It is no longer possible\', Cohen claims at one¶ point,
\`to call a spade a spade . . . because the level of connotations,¶
which is always open to multiple associations, including racist ones,¶
has been shut down \`\`By Order\'\'.\' 48 [No one would deny that
much]{.underline}¶ [that is called anti-racism has been ill-considered
or counter-productive]{.underline}¶ or simple-minded, [but to suggest
that this is the whole story]{.underline} - and this is¶ the picture one
gets from Cohen\'s account - appears simply bad faith.¶ Nor does one get
any sense from his account that some forms of antiracism¶ have been
subjected to the most rigorous critique - from other¶ anti-racists,
notably in this journal. So, too, there is the distorted depiction¶ of
teachers bearing the anti-racist message. In Cohen\'s world, they¶ are
always middle class, relying on a \`deficit model\' of working-class¶
culture, and engaged in a \`civilising mission\', believing themselves
to¶ be \`the bringers of reason and tolerance to those gripped by
unreason,¶ prejudice and ignorance\'.49 Doubtless such attitudes exist,
but Cohen\'s¶ depiction is so one-dimensional; it has no room for
complexity or¶ difference. If it did, he could not take up the position
that he does, of¶ the one who really knows. It is also a position that
takes Cohen on¶ to dangerous ground in which, at times at least, it
seems as though¶ all authority is bad (in the language of Foucault, it
is tutelary and¶ constitutes surveillance) and all resistance to
authority good, or at¶ least understandable.50¶ Racism without history¶
[[Not only is racism psychologised and individualised]{.underline}.
[It]{.underline}]{.mark} [also [becomes]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶]{.mark}
[something that is [universal]{.mark}.]{.underline} Cohen\'s colleague
Rustin makes this¶ clear in the article cited earlier,51 while Cohen
himself states that¶ \`Every language and culture, in so far as it is
able, privileges its own¶ practices, using them to define its own
origins, and defend its own¶ boundaries. Every form of ethnicity, if it
has the means, is ethnocentric.¶ The key word is if.\'52 (There is a
dangerous slippage here in that¶ \`ethnocentrism\' is not the same as
racism and, while it may turn into¶ it, it need not and frequently does
not.) [[What is not explained]{.underline}]{.mark} by¶ either Cohen or
Rustin [[is why some individuals]{.mark} or some groups
[are]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶ \`[more\' racist or less racist than
others]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Racism is]{.mark} thus
[completely]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶ [removed from history, but what is
also not explained]{.underline}]{.mark} [in this regard
[is]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶ [why it is more or less virulent at
particular times]{.underline}]{.mark} [and in particular]{.underline}¶
[places]{.underline}. [A psychoanalytic account]{.underline} like
Cohen\'s simply [cannot account]{.underline}¶ [for such
twentieth-century events as the massacre of the Armenians by the Turks
in 1914 or the destruction of the Jews, or indeed anything]{.underline}¶
[else]{.underline}. \`[To deny racism its history\']{.underline}, Cohen
had written in 1988, \`[is to]{.underline}¶ [surrender to a kind of
fatalism]{.underline}.\'53 **[Yet that is precisely the
position]{.underline}**¶ **[he has come to occupy]{.underline}**.¶ [[The
question is not whether or not racism operates at an
unconscious]{.underline}¶ [level]{.underline}]{.mark}[. There is clearly
too much evidence to deny this. [The question]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶
[is,]{.underline}]{.mark} [rather, [how important is this unconscious
working?]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Should it]{.underline}]{.mark}¶ [[be,
can it be, the focus of anti-racist strategy?]{.underline}]{.mark} For
Cohen, however,¶ the unconscious has become all; nothing else really
matters. [[Here we]{.underline}¶ [have reached the site of a
psychoanalytic determinism]{.underline}]{.mark} [- a curious
inversion]{.underline}¶ [of]{.underline} the [crude
materialism]{.underline} that Cohen would rightly distance himself¶
from. It is a determinism which holds that we are not at all rational¶
thinking beings, but that we are driven all the time by forces beyond¶
our control. [Our attachment to a belief or an ideal, our cultural
preferences]{.underline},¶ [all these are to be explained by some
supposed psychoanalytic]{.underline}¶ [interpretation]{.underline}.
**[[There is no hope,]{.mark} then]{.underline}**, except in the form of
psychoanalytic¶ or psychotherapeutic treatment and it is this which
Cohen¶ seeks to offer through his cultural studies approach.

Can we bring some order to this host of criticisms? It is remarkable
that, for all the criticisms of Žižek's political Romanticism, no one
has argued that the ultra- extremism of [Žižek's political position
might reflect his untenable attempt to shape his model for [political
action]{.mark} on the curative]{.underline} final [moment in [clinical
psychoanalysis.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The differences between
these]{.underline}]{.mark} two [[realms]{.underline}]{.mark}, listed in
Figure 5.1, [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly [too many and too
**[great]{.mark}** to restate -- [which]{.mark} has]{.underline} perhaps
[[caused]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**theoretical
oversight**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The key thing is this.
[[Lacan's]{.underline}]{.mark} notion of [traversing the fantasy
involves]{.underline} the [radical [transformation of]{.mark} people's
[subjective structure]{.mark}: a refounding of]{.underline} their most
[elementary beliefs]{.underline} about themselves, the world, and sexual
difference. [This [is]{.mark}]{.underline} undertaken [[in the security
of the clinic]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the basis of the analysands'
voluntary desire to overcome their inhibitions, symptoms and anxieties.
As a clinical and existential process, it has its own independent
importance and authenticity. [The [analysands]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
transforming their subjective world, [change the way they regard the
objective]{.underline}, shared social reality outside the clinic. [But
they [**do not transform** the world.]{.mark} The political relevance of
the clinic]{.underline} can only be (a) as a supporting moment in
ideology critique or (b) as a fully- fl edged model of politics,
provided that the political subject and its social object are ultimately
identical. Option (*b*), Žižek's option, [rests on the
idea]{.underline}, not only [of a subject]{.underline} who becomes who
he is only through his (mis) recognition of the objective sociopolitical
order, but [whose 'traversal]{.underline} of the fantasy' [is
immediately identical with]{.underline} his [transformation of the
socio- political system]{.underline} or Other. Hence, according to
Žižek, we can analyse the institutional embodiments of this Other using
psychoanalytic categories. In Chapter 4, we saw Žižek's resulting
elision of the distinction between the (subjective) Ego Ideal and the
(objective) Symbolic Order. [This leads him to analyse our entire
culture as a single subject--object,]{.underline} whose perverse (or
perhaps even psychotic) structure is expressed in every manifestation of
contemporary life. Žižek's decisive political- theoretic errors, one
substantive and the other methodological, are different (see Figure 5.1)
[[The substantive problem is to equate]{.mark} any [political
change]{.mark}]{.underline} worth the name [[with]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [total [change of the subject--object]{.mark}]{.underline} that is,
today, global capitalism. This is a type of change that can only mean
equating politics with violent regime change, and ultimately embracing
dictatorial government, as Žižek now frankly avows (*IDLC* 412--19). We
have seen that the ultra- political form of Žižek's criticism of
everyone else, [the theoretical Left and]{.underline} the [wider
politics]{.underline}, is that [no one is sufficiently radical for
him]{.underline} -- even, we will discover, Chairman Mao. We now see
that [this is because [Žižek's]{.mark} model of
[politics]{.mark}]{.underline} proper [[is modelled
on]{.underline}]{.mark} a pre- critical [[analogy
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the total transformation of [a
subject's]{.underline} entire [[subjective structure]{.mark}, at the end
of the talking cure.]{.underline} For what could the concrete
consequences of this governing analogy be? We have seen that [[Žižek
equates the individual]{.underline}]{.mark} fantasy
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[collective identity of **an entire
people**.]{.underline}]{.mark} The social fantasy, he says, structures
the regime's 'inherent transgressions': at once subjects' habitual ways
of living the letter of the law, and the regime's myths of origin and of
identity. [If political action is modelled on the Lacanian cure, it must
involve the complete 'traversal']{.underline} -- in Hegel's terms, the
abstract versus the determinate negation -- [of]{.underline} all these
[lived myths]{.underline}, practices and habits. Politics must involve
the periodic founding of entire new subject--objects. Providing the
model for this set of ideas, the fi rst Žižekian political subject was
Schelling's divided God, who gave birth to the entire Symbolic Order
before the beginning of time (*IDLC* 153; *OB* 144--8). But [[can the
political theorist]{.mark} reasonably]{.underline} hope or
[[expect]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[subjects will]{.mark} simply [give
up on]{.mark} all [their inherited ways]{.mark}]{.underline}, myths and
beliefs, all [[in one world- creating moment?]{.underline}]{.mark} And
can they be legitimately asked or expected to, on the basis of a set of
ideals whose legitimacy they will only retrospectively see, after they
have acceded to the Great Leap Forward? And [if they do not]{.underline}
-- for Žižek laments that today subjects are politically disengaged in
unprecedented ways -- [what means can the theorist and his allies use to
move them to do so?]{.underline}

**Can't scale up Lacanian psychoanalysis to the state level**

**Epstein 10** \[senior lecturer in government and IR -- University of
Sydney

Charlotte, "Who speaks? Discourse, the subject and the study of identity
in international politics," *European Journal of International
Relations* XX(X) 1--24\]

To be clear, this move is not intended to deny the intimate links
between discourse and subjectivity. The earlier foray into Lacanian
thought served precisely to underline the centrality of discourse to
both the making and subsequent analysis of the subject. But by the same
token it also drew out what is required to wield the discourse approach
effec­tively in IR. Indeed [[Lacan's analysis emphasizes]{.mark} the
sheer complexity of the [dynamics of a highly individual
phenomenon]{.mark}]{.underline} (identity), [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
consequently [[the difficulties in taking this]{.mark} level [as the
starting point for analysing]{.mark}]{.underline} all [[other
levels]{.mark} at which identity is]{.underline} politically [at
play.]{.underline}13 As the discipline that positions itself at the
highest level of analysis (the supra­national), [[IR cannot maintain its
focus at the level where]{.underline}]{.mark} some of the [finer
[debates around subjectivity take place]{.mark}]{.underline} (see for
example, Butler, 1997). [[The issue]{.underline}]{.mark} here
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} one of [[discipli­nary
specificity]{.underline}]{.mark}, or, in other words, equipping IR for
what it wants to do; and the solu­tion proposed is one of suspension or
bracketing. To restate this important point differently, at the
individual level, subjectivities and subject-positions remain
coextensive. [The distinction between subject-positions and
subjectivities becomes operative once the analysis shifts beyond the
individual level]{.underline}. This distinction thus offers a
theoretically cogent way of studying identity while bracket­ing some of
its more unwieldy dimensions that may, moreover, not be pertinent at the
levels at which IR casts its focus. It renders the discourse approach
operative for IR, because it makes it possible to study *state*
identities, without having to presume that states have feelings, or
indeed enter into questions of how much exactly are they like people, or
what kind of selves do they possess. What the discourse approach
analyses, then, is the ways in which actors --- crucially, whether
individuals or states --- define themselves by stepping into a
particular subject-position carved out by a discourse. In taking on the
'I/we' of that discourse, actors' identities are produced in a very
specific way. In doing so, they are establishing them­selves as the
subjects of particular discourses, such as the anti-whaling discourse,
and thereby marking themselves as 'anti-whalers'. How, then, do
discursive subject-positions differ from Wendt's (1999: 227--229) role
identities, where the actor is similarly seen as stepping into
institutionalized roles (such as professor and student)? The crucial
differ­ence is that [the concept of subject-position does not harbour any
assumption about any primordial self supporting]{.underline} these
[roles.]{.underline} Importantly, [[this is not to say that the self
does not exist]{.underline}]{.mark} --- that the professor or student
have no selves --- but [[simply that the concept is not relevant
to]{.mark} the [analysis of]{.mark}]{.underline} the discursive
[construction of [identity]{.mark},]{.underline} especially when [[taken
to the interstate level.]{.underline}]{.mark}

**[2ac positivism good]{.underline}**

**Valid, descriptive theories of the world are an essential prerequisite
to emancipatory critique -- epistemic shifts from Eurocentric thought
are impossible without reclaiming the concept of objectivity.**

[The rejection of positivism]{.underline} which is a central element of
recent critiques of mainstream IR [has tended to extend to rejection of
the]{.underline} notion and [possibility of science itself]{.underline}.
Science, often written in quotation marks 'science', is [seen as
inherently part of the project of Enlightenment-modernity]{.underline},
[a mode of technical instrumental knowledge which is necessarily a means
of control and domination]{.underline} of both society and nature 22 .
[An important component of the critique]{.underline} of the positivist
orthodoxy [is]{.underline} exposure of [its coincidence with the
interests of the powerful]{.underline}. [Dominant ideas]{.underline} and
methods which rest on claims of value-free scientificity and neutrality
[are shown to mask or legitimise the]{.underline} interests of the
powerful and the [exercise of power and domination]{.underline}. The
very claim to be able to produce value-free, neutral scientific truth is
rejected in a world of inherently conflicting interests. Instead, the
'illusion of objectivism must be replaced with the recognition that
knowledge is always constituted in reflection of interests' (Ashley
1981: 207).

[There are **two kinds of conflation**]{.underline} which are embedded
[within this critical stance]{.underline}. [The first
conflates]{.underline} the contents of [natural scientific knowledge
with the uses to which it is put in society]{.underline}. [Much
scientific knowledge]{.underline}, in both natural and social sciences,
[has indeed been produced by and in the]{.underline} explicit [interests
of the powerful]{.underline}, an integral part of the construction and
maintenance of unequal and oppressive social orders, and the
administration of accumulation and imperialism. [But it is **important
not to conflate the contents of knowledge with its social conditions of
production and use**]{.underline}. [When]{.underline} scientific
knowledge is [developed for]{.underline} and utilised in the service of
[oppression or commercial profit]{.underline} [as opposed to the
increased satisfaction of human needs]{.underline}, the [oppression
results from social forces, not from the cognitive properties of
scientific knowledge]{.underline} 23:

Even assuming all the results of a research project are objectively
true, the area chosen for investigation may be determined by contentious
ideological assumptions or practical interests. Thus it is likely that
drug companies have concentrated on artificially synthesized drugs to
the detriment of research into those occurring naturally in plants; and
it is certain that military might and commercial profit are the chief
determinants of which secrets of nature get uncovered. [In a world where
science was funded with a view to satisfying human needs and conserving
planetary resources, quite different discoveries might be made --
neither more or less objective than the findings of modern science, but
useful for different purposes]{.underline}. (Collier 1994: 180; see also
Collier 1979).

[The second conflation reduces scientific method to a positivist
approach]{.underline}, equating positivist social science with social
science per se with technical instrumentality. [It is often asserted
that the problem with positivist IR is that it applies the method of
natural sciences]{.underline} or 'the scientific method' [to the study
of social phenomena]{.underline} 24 . **[This is a
mischaracterisation]{.underline}** of [the real]{.underline} nature of
the [problem]{.underline}, [which is that positivism first
misunderstands]{.underline} the method of [natural science]{.underline},
and then applies these misunderstood methodological principles to the
study of social phenomena (Bhaskar 1997). Recognition of this enables us
to retrieve the possibility of a particular form of social inquiry which
can be called scientific or objective from abandonment along with
positivism 25 .

[A positivist understanding]{.underline} of scientific inquiry [rests on
a Humean notion of cause as constant conjunction between empirical
variables or events]{.underline}, and explanation as the discovery of
empirical regularities and correlations. When such empirical
regularities are discovered they can be used to make predictions. This
assumes an empiricist ontology and epistemology: the world consists only
of that which is available to direct experience, and the only source of
knowledge is through direct sensory experience. [Critiques of positivism
are correct]{.underline} to question these assumptions about knowledge
and the world, but they are [not correct in equating this with
scientific method]{.underline}. Positivism consists of philosophers'
misunderstanding of the actual practice of natural science. **[The
practice of experiment is central]{.underline}** to the method of some
natural sciences. A scientific experiment involves establishing closure:
creating an artificial environment where the external and internal
conditions are controlled so as to isolate particular features and
mechanisms. This enables scientists to discover about aspects of reality
which are not empirical : the [causal properties]{.underline} and
necessary ways-of-operating of specific mechanisms in nature which
**[are real]{.underline}** because they have the capacity to bring about
change, given appropriate conditions and inputs, **[but]{.underline}**
are **[not empirical]{.underline}** -- [they cannot be seen, only the
effects of their operation can be seen]{.underline}. **[This
non-positivist, philosophical realist theory of science]{.underline}**,
epistemology and ontology **[is very different]{.underline}** from the
positivist misunderstanding of scientific method and explanation.
[Scientific theories]{.underline} and the discovery of natural laws
[refer to real properties]{.underline} and causal powers of structured
entities, [not empirical events and regularities]{.underline} (Bhaskar
1997).

[What are the implications]{.underline} of this non-positivist theory of
science for social inquiry[?]{.underline} [The fact of human reflexivity
rules out the possibility of experiment and prediction in social
inquiry]{.underline}, because it is impossible to establish closure in
the social world 26 . [Ideas are causally efficacious]{.underline}:
through informing social action ideas have causal efficacy in
codetermining or influencing what actually happens, including (usually
as an unintended outcome) the reproduction of social relations. [This
means that ideas are part of the object of social inquiry, as is
fore-grounded by all variants of so-called reflexive approaches in
International Relations]{.underline} (Keohane 1988). When we study
society part of what we study includes the ideas that are held in that
society. But we also study other aspects of society which are
irreducible to ideas or individuals -- real but non-empirical structures
of social relations, historically-specific socially-produced material
conditions, and so on.

This non-positivist theory of knowledge and the world gives rise to a
notion of objectivity which does not entail the positivist commitment to
value-free neutrality. Philosophical realism holds that the world
consists of natural and social objects or entities which exist and have
particular properties and causal powers independently of what, if
anything, is known about them 27 . Knowledge about different aspects of
the material and social world can be non-existent, partial, more or less
adequate, more or less right or wrong. This informs a notion of
objectivity which refers to what is the case, regardless of what is
thought or believed to be the case:

[The first and central use of the word "objectivity" is to refer to what
is true independently of any subject judging it to be true]{.underline}.
[To say that it is an objective fact that the Earth is the third planet
from the Sun is to say that this is so whether or not anyone knows or
believes it, or even is able to formulate the statement]{.underline}. To
say that kindness is an objective value is to say that it is a value,
whether or not anyone judges it to be a value; it would be a value even
if the whole of society regarded it as a culpable weakness and it was
only practised shamefacedly as a private foible. (Collier 2003: 134-5).

This notion of objectivity does not entail a belief that human beings
can acquire absolute truth and certain knowledge about either social or
natural phenomena. [It is possible to acknowledge that knowledge is
always inherently fallible and socially constructed while retaining a
notion of the objective reality which ideas are about]{.underline}. This
allows commitment to judgemental rationality -- the possibility of
judging between different ideas on the basis of their relative adequacy,
in terms of their relation to objective reality 28 . In social inquiry
objectivity does not imply some form of external position of
independence 'outside' society 29 . All knowledge is socially produced;
but all knowledge is also about something which exists independently of
the knowledge about it. (This is the case even for knowledge about
ideas).

[The 'common-sense' view]{.underline} pervading recent discussions of
epistemology, ontology and methodology [in IR asserts that objectivity
implies value-free neutrality]{.underline}. [However, **objective social
inquiry has an inherent tendency to be critical**]{.underline}, in
various senses. **[To the extent that objective knowledge provides a
better and more adequate account of reality than other ideas, such
knowledge is inherently critical (implicitly or explicitly) of those
ideas]{.underline}**. 30 In other words **[critical social inquiry does
not (or not only) manifest its 'criticalness' through self-claimed
labels of being critical or siding with the oppressed, but through the
substantive critique of prevailing ideas]{.underline}**. [Objective
social knowledge constitutes a specific form of criticism: **explanatory
critique**]{.underline}. The critique [of dominant ideas or
ideologies]{.underline} is [elaborated through providing a more adequate
explanation of aspects of the world]{.underline}, [and in so doing
**exposing what is wrong with the dominant ideology**]{.underline}. This
may also entail revealing the social conditions which give rise to
ideologies, thus exposing the necessary and causal relation between
particular social relations and particular ideological conceptions.

In societies which are constituted by unequal structures of social
relations giving rise to unequal power and conflicting interests, [the
reproduction of those structured relations is in the interests of the
powerful, whereas transformation]{.underline} of existing structured
relations [is in the interests of the weak]{.underline}. **[Because
ideas inform social action they are casually efficacious]{.underline}**
[either in]{.underline} securing [the reproduction of existing social
relations]{.underline} (usually as an unintended consequence of social
practice), [or in]{.underline} informing social action aimed at
[transforming social relations]{.underline}. This is why **[ideas cannot
be 'neutral']{.underline}**. Ideas which provide a misrepresentation of
the nature of society, the causes of unequal social conditions, and the
conflicting interests of the weak and powerful, will tend to help secure
the reproduction of prevailing social relations. Ideas which provide a
more adequate account of the way society is structured and how
structured social relations produce concrete conditions of inequality
and exploitation can potentially inform efforts to change those social
relations. In this sense, [ideas which are false are ideological and, in
serving to promote the]{.underline} reproduction of the [status quo and
avoid]{.underline} attempts at [radical change]{.underline}, [are in the
interests of the powerful]{.underline}. An account which is objective
will contradict ideological ideas, implicitly or explicitly criticising
them for their false or flawed accounts of reality. The
[criticism]{.underline} here [arises]{.underline} not, or [not only,
from]{.underline} pointing out the coincidence between ideologies and
the interests of the powerful, nor from [a prior normative stance of
solidarity with the oppressed]{.underline}, **[but from exposing the
flaws in dominant ideologies through a more adequate
account]{.underline}** [of the nature and causes of social
conditions]{.underline} 31 .

**[A normative commitment to the oppressed must entail a commitment to
truth and objectivity, because true ideas are in the interest of the
oppressed, false ideas are in the interest of the
oppressors]{.underline}**. In other words, **[the best way to declare
solidarity with the oppressed is to declare one's commitment to
objective inquiry]{.underline}** 32 . [As Nzongola-Ntalaja]{.underline}
(1986: 10) [has put it]{.underline}:

[It is a question of whether one analyses society from the standpoint of
the **dominant groups**, who **have a vested interest in mystifying**
the way **society** works, or from the standpoint of ordinary people,
who have nothing to lose from truthful analyses of their
predicament]{.underline}.

[The **philosophical realist theory of science**, objectivity and
explanatory critique]{.underline} thus [provides an **alternative
response to the relationship between knowledge and power**]{.underline}.
[**Instead of choosing perspectives on the basis of our ethical
commitment to the cause of the oppressed** and to emancipatory social
change, **we should choose between contending ideas on the basis of
which provides a better account of objective social
reality**]{.underline}. [This will inherently provide a critique of the
ideologies which]{.underline}, by virtue of their flawed account of the
social world, [serve the interests of the powerful]{.underline}.

Exemplars of explanatory critique in International Relations are
provided in the work of scholars such as Siba Grovogui, James Gathii,
Anthony Anghie, Bhupinder Chimni, Jacques Depelchin, Hilbourne Watson,
Robert Vitalis, Sankaran Krishna, Michel-Rolph Trouillot 33 . Their work
provides critiques of central categories, theories and discourses in the
theory and practice of IR and narratives of world history, including
assumptions about sovereignty, international society, international law,
global governance, the nature of the state. They expose the ideological
and racialised nature of central aspects of IR through a critical
examination of both the long historical trajectory of imperial
ideologies regarding colonized peoples, and the actual practices of
colonialism and decolonisation in the constitution of international
orders and local social conditions. Their work identifies the flaws in
current ideas by revealing how they systematically misrepresent or
ignore the actual history of social change in Africa, the Caribbean and
other regions of the Third World, both past and present -- during both
colonial and neo-colonial periods of the imperial world order. Their
work reveals how racism, violence, exploitation and dispossession,
colonialism and neo-colonialism have been central to the making of
contemporary international order and contemporary doctrines of
international law, sovereignty and rights, and how such themes are
glaring in their absence from histories and theories of international
relations and international history.

[Objective social knowledge which accurately depicts and explains social
reality has these qualities by virtue of its **relation to its object,
not its subject**]{.underline}. As Collier argues, "The science/ideology
distinction is an epistemological one, not a social one." (Collier 1979:
60). So, [for example, in the work of Grovogui, Gathii and Depelchin,
the general perspective]{.underline} and knowledge [of]{.underline}
conditions in and [the history of Africa might be due]{.underline}
largely [to the African social origins of the authors]{.underline}.
[However the judgement that their accounts are superior]{.underline} to
those of mainstream IR [rests not on the fact that the authors are
African, but on the greater adequacy of their accounts]{.underline}
[with respect to]{.underline} the actual [historical and contemporary
production of conditions and change in Africa]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [elsewhere]{.underline} in the Third World. The
criteria for choosing their accounts over others derives from the
relation between the ideas and their objects (what they are about), not
from the relation between the ideas and their subjects (who produced
them). It is vital to retain explicitly some commitment to objectivity
in social inquiry, to the notion that the proper criterion for judging
ideas about the world lies in what they say about the world, not whose
ideas they are.

[A fundamental problem which underlies]{.underline} the origin and
reproduction of IR's [eurocentricity]{.underline} [is the overwhelming
dominance of ideas produced in and by the west, and the
wilful]{.underline} and determined **[silencing of the voices and
histories of the colonised]{.underline}**. **[But the result of this
fundamental problem is flawed knowledge about the world]{.underline}**.
**[Eurocentricity is therefore a dual problem concerning both the
authors and the content of knowledge, and cannot be resolved through
normative commitments alone]{.underline}**. It is not only the voices of
the colonised, but the histories of colonialism, which have been glaring
in their absence from the discipline of International Relations.

[Overcoming eurocentricity therefore requires not only concerted effort
from the centre to create space and listen to hitherto marginalised
voices, but **also commitment to correcting the flaws in prevailing
knowledge**]{.underline} -- **[and it is not only 'the Other' who can
and should elaborate this critique]{.underline}**. A vitally important
implication of objectivity is that **[it is the responsibility of
European and American, just as much as non-American or non-European
scholars, to decolonise IR]{.underline}**. [The importance of
objectivity]{.underline} in social inquiry defended here
[can]{.underline} perhaps **[be seen as a form of epistemological
internationalism]{.underline}**. **[It is not necessary to be African to
attempt to tell a more accurate account of the history of Europe's role
in the making of the contemporary Africa]{.underline}** and the rest of
the world, for example, [or to write counter-histories of
'the]{.underline} expansion of international society' which detail the
[systematic barbarity of]{.underline} so-called [Western
civilisation]{.underline}. It is not necessary to have been colonised to
recognise and document the violence, racism, genocide and dispossession
which have characterised European expansion over five hundred years.

**[2ac psychoanalysis racist]{.underline}**

**Psychoanalysis is antiblack.**

This article explores the prospects for a psychological contribution to
postcolonial thought through the mediation of psychoanalysis. It does
not attempt to deconstruct or historicize postcolonialism itself, at
least to any significant extent, further than to state the need for a
postcolonial theory of the subject that incorporates an understanding of
affective and "subjective" issues---precisely the area with which
psychoanalysis is primarily concerned. [The positioning of
psychoanalysis as a progressive, critical approach is not, however, a
particularly secure one]{.underline}. The central difficulty is the way
**[[psychoanalysis]{.mark} has [frequently aligned]{.mark} itself
[with]{.mark} conformist and even "[repressive" tendencies that
reproduce colonial]{.mark} [and]{.mark} at times [racist
tropes]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [often in the context of psychological
individualism, but sometimes in an explicitly political
manner]{.underline} (Jacoby, 1983; Frosh, 1999). [**[This is
despite]{.mark}** the existence of **[a contrary urge in
psychoanalysis]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially reflected in the
"critical theory" tradition that made use of it in the 1950s and 1960s
(e.g., Marcuse, 1955) **[but also in the work of several followers of
Lacan]{.underline}** (Stavrakakis, 2007) and some British social
reformists (Rustin, 1991). The tendency of American ego psychology to
give prominence to "adaptationist" perspectives has been widely noted
and has been criticized both by political radicals (e.g., Jacoby, 1975,
1983) and by Lacanians (cf. Roudinesco, 1990, p. 175: "According to
\[Lacan\] such a psychological science had been affected by the ideals
of the society in which it was produced"). The adoption of a strong
antihomosexual bias by orthodox mid-20th century psychoanalysts has had
particularly damaging consequences for the practice and reputation of
psychoanalysis as a whole, even though recent attempts to reconcile
psychoanalysis and queer theory are beginning to bear fruit (Frosh,
2006; Campbell, 2000). Psychoanalytic assumptions about the nature of a
civilized mind will be briefly discussed below; but **[[overt]{.mark}
forms of [racism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, notably antisemitism, **[have
also on occasions been evident in its institutional
practices]{.underline}** (Frosh, 2005, 2012). Most relevantly,
**[[colonialism is]{.mark} a [deeply problematic]{.mark} issue
[for]{.mark} [psychoanalysis]{.mark}, because [it is engrained
in]{.mark} much [psychoanalytic thinking and terminology]{.mark}, and
this [has effects on contemporary theory and practice]{.mark} [in ways
that are not]{.mark} always [recognized]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For
example, as discussed further below, psychoanalysts often draw on the
language of the "primitive" to refer to unreasoning elements of people's
psychic lives. Thus, [a notion that someone might be evincing a
"primitive fantasy of destruction" is a very familiar one, but what is
not acknowledged is that this terminology not only has its roots in a
colonial opposition between primitive and civilized, but it also
reproduces this division "unconsciously" when it is used]{.underline}.
This is to say, the terminology is full of associations that position
some ideas as civilized and some as primitive, [reinforcing a
developmental scheme that is heavily inflected by assumptions about the
relationship between seemingly irrational and rational thought
processes--- and in particular who might "own" them. The
[history]{.mark} [of this stretches]{.mark} back [to the beginnings
of]{.mark} [psychoanalysis]{.mark}]{.underline}, reflecting the colonial
and racist (including antisemitic) assumptions prevalent in the Europe
out of which psychoanalysis arose. Freud deployed the idea that the
thinking of what he called "savages" was not only contrasted to
"civilized" mentality, but also revealed the origins of mental life both
for the culture as a whole (the contemporary savage being a throwback to
the precursors of modern "man") and for the individual (the savage mind
being like that of a child). For example, at the beginning of Totem and
Taboo, subtitled Some Points of Agreement between the Mental Lives of
Savages and Neurotics, he wrote, There are men still living who, as we
believe, stand very near to primitive man, far nearer than we do, and
whom we therefore regard as his direct heirs and representatives. Such
is our view of those whom we describe as savages or half-savages; and
their mental life must have a peculiar interest for us if we are right
in seeing in it a well-preserved picture of an early stage of our own
development. (Freud, 1913, pp. 1) The repetitive first person plural
pronoun is notable here: "we believe," "we do," "we regard," "our view,"
"we describe," "us," "our own development". The savage is the other, the
not "us"; though as will be outlined briefly below, there is quite a
degree of subtlety in what this might mean. Freud also was explicit
about how "savages" share attributes with children, both in terms of how
they think, and how they are thought about by "we adults". "It seems to
me quite possible," he wrote (p. 99), "that the same may be true of our
attitude toward the psychology of those races that have remained at the
animistic level as is true of our attitude toward the mental life of
children, which we adults no longer understand and whose fullness and
delicacy of feeling we have in consequence so greatly underestimated".
The adoption of a binary between savage and civilized is not perhaps
intrinsically racist and colonialist, but the assumption that the latter
always displaces the former and, more importantly, that the terms can be
applied to different people, is. In Freud's thought, savage societies
hold to various types of irrational thinking (concreteness, mystical
attitudes to death, etc.), processes reviewed throughout Totem and Taboo
(Freud, 1913) and explicitly linked with children in more "civilized"
societies. For instance, in writing of wish fulfillment (p. 84), Freud
commented, If children and primitive men find play and imitative
representation enough for them, that is not a sign of their being
unassuming in our sense or of their resignedly accepting their actual
impotence. It is the easily understandable result of the paramount
virtue they ascribe to their wishes, of the will that is associated with
those wishes and of the methods by which those wishes operate. These
ways of thinking make them "primitive" in the developmental sense that
they should normatively be overcome by more advanced modes of being---a
theme also taken up in the analysis of religion in The Future of an
Illusion (Freud, 1927). Although Freud himself does not press for
political action that does this--- he was interested rather in how
science might overcome superstition---the general approach is consistent
with the justification of colonialism and even slavery on the grounds of
the inherent inferiority of the primitive. There is another subtle turn
here, however, that is specific to Freud and the early history of
psychoanalysis, relating to the intense antisemitism of Freud's time.
Gilman (1993) showed how deeply rooted antisemitism was in the beliefs
of many Europeans, markedly so in the Viennese among whom psychoanalysis
grew up, and how widespread were ideas such as that Jews were castrated
(hence, feminine), that they were "oriental" and maybe even "black," and
that they were primitive in the religious sense (Christianity having
displaced Judaism) but also psychologically, socially, and racially.
Gilman suggested that Freud, consciously or unconsciously, constructed
some of the most conspicuously radical elements of his theory in
response to this. For instance, Gilman argued that the trope that Jewish
men are castrated through circumcision is replaced in psychoanalysis by
the idea that the castration complex is universal, so that all people---
including the most gentile---follow a model set by the Jews. This
Freudian impulse to disarm antisemitism by positioning the Jews as the
truly civilized people (which was mirrored in the idea that as
nationalism took hold in Europe at the end of the 19th century, the Jews
might be the only "true Europeans" oriented toward a transnational
comity) results in a shifting of the "other" of European society away
from the Jew and toward the "savage," that is, the colonized, Black
"primitive" of slavery and the European imagination. This theoretical
move attempts to relieve Jews from the opprobrium of primitivity
(unsuccessfully, as was demonstrated unequivocally just a few years
later) by passing it onto the colonized other. There is always a danger
with summary accounts such as this one, that the history it sketches
simplistically reduces a tension-filled and ambiguous process to a
linear narrative. It is certainly the case, for example, that
psychoanalysis was from the start full of impulses that challenged and
subverted the assumptions of the societies in which it found itself.
Indeed, this is one reason for the mixture of explosive embrace and
resistance that characterized the response to psychoanalysis: On the one
hand, it fuelled enormous shifts in self-perception, artistic creativity
and even political and economic thought (not confined to outspoken
radicals--- see, e.g., John Maynard Keynes', 1919, 1936, post-World War
1 use of Freudian ideas to argue for the importance of emotional factors
in economics). In many respects, it is precisely in the tension between
what Toril Moi (1989, p. 197) called, in relation to the attitude of
psychoanalysis to femininity, Freud's "colonizing impulse" and its
contrary acceptance of "the logic of another scene"---the specific
expressiveness of unconscious life---that the creativity of
psychoanalysis inheres. Nevertheless, consideration of the rootedness of
much psychoanalytic thought in colonial assumptions is important not
merely to sweep away the ideological detritus, but also to identify
where the investments of psychoanalysis can provide leverage for
understanding the place of psychosocial theory in the postcolonial
project. A further example of the "detritus" might be found in some work
by Celia Brickman (2003), which offers an extensive account of how the
language of primitivity infects psychoanalysis. Like Gilman, she notes
how Freud's "universalizing reconfigurations" (p. 165) turn the despised
Jewish body into the model for humanity as a whole. From the perspective
of postcolonialism, however, this move, which is subversive in relation
to antisemitism, is "made at considerable expense," because "the
modalities of inferiority previously ascribed to the Jews did not simply
disappear but were ambivalently displaced onto a series of abjected
others: primitives, women and homosexuals". Brickman elaborated on how
the assimilation of the Jewish other to Europeanism positions
psychoanalysis as a colonialist discipline and incorporates racism into
its fabric of argumentation. Categorized as a member of a primitive
race, Freud repudiated primitivity, locating himself and his work within
European civilization, with both its scientific and colonizing
enterprises, and replacing the opposition of Aryan/Jew with the
opposition of civilized/primitive (p. 167). In relation to
psychoanalytic practice, primitive usually means either or both of
fundamental and irrational. [A primitive impulse is never a rational
one; it always arises unmediated from the unconscious and hence has not
been worked over by the secondary processes of thought. The sleight of
hand then is to link this kind of primitivity with the irrationality of
the colonized other and then to make rationality itself the marker of
civilized human society]{.underline}--- or even of what it means to be
human at all. After all, when one loses one's power of reason, one
ceases to be able to function as human at least to the degree that equal
citizenship is at risk. [In the colonial context, this justifies
colonization: irrational primitives cannot be trusted to run their own
affairs; the civilized European is justifiably superior, for everyone's
good]{.underline}. Commenting on Freud's anthropological speculation,
Brickman (2003) noted how the psyche comes to be envisaged as a
representation of colonialism and hence how Freud explicitly parallels
the structure of the mind with that of (colonial) society: \[By\]
correlating the progression of narcissism, the oedipal stage, and
maturity with animism (savagery), religion (barbarianism), and science
(civilisation), Totem and Taboo transposed the racial assumptions of the
cultural evolutionary scale onto the modern psyche . . . The
psychoanalytically conceived norm of mature subjectivity was, by virtue
of the correlation of libidinal development with the cultural
evolutionary scale, a rationalism whose unstated color was white, just
as its unstated gender was male. (p. 72) **[[Even though these Freudian
assumptions are mainly unstated]{.mark}, [the terminology and the
conceptual baggage of the savage" and the barbarian remained with
psychoanalysis for some time and is still lying only just-dormant in
those references to "primitive feelings]{.mark}]{.underline}**" that
often can be found in clinical psychoanalytic discussions. [[A]{.mark}
certain **[mode of rationality]{.mark}** [is given]{.mark} [priority
here]{.mark}, **[which is attached to masculine "reason"]{.mark}** as it
has developed over the period of industrial modernity]{.underline}
(Frosh, 1994). [That which falls short of it---[the]{.mark}
**["unreason" attributed to women, children, and primitive
cultures]{.mark}**---[is derogated and made subject to reason's
imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is not, of course, to imply that
one should fully affirm unreason as a simple alternative to colonial
reason; it is rather to claim that the reason-- unreason opposition is
itself rooted in a colonial mentality that supports it and narrows the
range of what is culturally validated. In a similar vein, Neil Altman
(2000, p. 591) commented, "When Freud the ego psychologist said, 'Where
id was, there ego shall be,' he defined the goals of psychoanalysis in
terms reminiscent of the colonial mentality. In this sense, the
structure of racism is built into structural psychoanalytic theory,
particularly in its ego-psychological form". This claim is itself
resonant of the critique of ego psychology mentioned earlier. The
argument runs that because this form of psychoanalysis assumes reason to
be superior to unreason, its concurrent assumption that unreason is
characteristic of "primitives" means that it is promoting a colonizing
process (reason trumping unreason; civilized displacing primitive) that
is embedded in a racist paradigm. As an instructive aside, it is perhaps
worth noting that ego psychology itself has a complex set of origins,
one of which regularly gets lost when its notions of adaptation are
pronounced solely conformist and colonialist. The occlusion here is of
the personal history of most of the postSecond World War American ego
psychologists as migrants or refugees from Nazi Europe. Their concerns
were indeed to find creative ways to adapt to a new society; in
addition, they were exercised by the explosion of irrationality that had
overwhelmed their lost homelands, and their impulse to find ways to fend
this off and protect future societies from its recurrence was perhaps
understandable.

In Psychoanalysis and Black Novels, Claudia Tate explains why
[[psychoanalytic theory has largely been avoided by Black
intellectuals]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Focusing on the dynamics of
family\* relations while ignoring the social]{.underline} [forces that
precondition the family environment, **[the
psychoanalytic]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[[model \"relegates]{.mark} the
bleak [material circumstances]{.mark} of real lives [to
the]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[background]{.underline}**]{.mark}.\"
[Carrying \"irritating baggage\" with it as it isolates the]{.underline}
[Black family from the social forces that condition it, psychoanalytic
the]{.underline}-[ory \"has avoided examining the relationship of social
oppression to fam]{.underline}-[ily dysfunction and the blighted inner
worlds of individuals]{.underline}\" (16). Thus ¶
[[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} who study African American literature
\"[[shun\" psychoanalysis]{.underline} **[because it effectively
\"effaces racism and recasts its effects as a
person]{.underline}**-**[ality disorder]{.underline}** **[caused by
familial rather than social pathology]{.underline}**]{.mark}\" (16). Be-
¶ cause of the continuation of racial oppression and \"the demand for
black ¶ literature to identify and militate against it,\" remarks Tate,
\"black liter- ¶ ature evolves so as to prove that racism exists in the
real world and is ¶ not a figment of the black imagination\" (17).

The [postmodernists\']{.underline} problem is that they [cannot live
with disappointment]{.underline}. All [the tragedies of the political
project of emancipation]{.underline} ± the evils of Stalinism in
particular ± [are seen as the inevitable product of]{.underline} men and
women [trying to create a better society.]{.underline} But, **[[rather
than engage in a critical assessment of how]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for
instance, **[radical political [movements go wrong, they discard
the]{.mark} emancipatory [project]{.mark}]{.underline}** and impulse
itself. The postmodernists, as Sivanandan puts it, blame modernity for
having failed them: \`the intellectuals and [[academics have fled into
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark} and deconstruction and representation ±
[as though to interpret the world is more important than to change it,
**[as though changing]{.mark} the [interpretation is all we could do in
a changing world\']{.mark}**]{.underline}.58 [To justify their flight
from]{.underline} a [politics]{.underline} holding out the prospect of
radical change through self-activity, [the disappointed
intellectuals]{.underline} and abundant intellectual
[alibis]{.underline} for themselves in the very work they
[champion]{.underline}, including, in Cohen\'s case,
[psychoanalysis]{.underline}. What Marshall Berman says of Foucault
seems true also of **[[psychoanalysis]{.underline}]{.mark}**; that it
**[[offers \`a]{.mark} world-[historical alibi\' for]{.mark} the
[passivity]{.mark} and helplessness]{.underline}** felt by many in the
1970s, **[[and]{.mark} that [it has nothing but contempt for those
naive]{.mark} enough [to imagine that it might be possible for]{.mark}
modern [human-kind to be free]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [At every turn for
such theorists,]{.underline} as Berman argues, whether in sexuality,
politics, even our imagination, [we are nothing but
prisoners]{.underline}: there is no freedom in Foucault\'s world,
because his language forms a seamless web, a cage far more airtight than
anything Weber ever dreamed of, into which no life can break . . .
**[[There is no point in trying to resist]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
**[[oppression]{.mark}s]{.underline}** and injustices of modern life,
[since even our dreams of freedom only add more links to our
chains]{.underline}; [[however, once we grasp]{.mark} the
[futility]{.mark} of it all, [at least we can
relax]{.mark}]{.underline}.59 Cohen\'s **[political
[defeatism]{.mark}]{.underline}** and his conviction in the explanatory
power of his new faith **[[of psychoanalysis lead him to
be]{.mark}]{.underline}** contemptuous and **[[dismissive of any attempt
at]{.mark} political solidarity or [collective
action]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [For him, \`communities\' are always
\`imagined\']{.underline}, which, in his view, means [based on
fantasy]{.underline}, while different forms of working-class
organisation, from the craft fraternity to the revolutionary group, are
dismissed as \`fantasies of self-sufficient combination\'.60 **[[In this
scenario, the idea that people might come
together]{.underline}]{.mark}**, think together, analyse together **[and
act together as rational beings [is impossible]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
**[The idea of a genuine community of equals becomes a pure
fantasy]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [a \`symbolic retrieval\' of something
that never existed in the first place:]{.underline} \`Community is a
magical device for conjuring something apparently solidary out of the
thin air of modern times, a mechanism of re-enchantment.\' As for
[history]{.underline}, it [is always false]{.underline}, since \`We are
always dealing with invented traditions.\'61 Now, **[[this
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** not only non- sense, but **[[dangerous
nonsense]{.underline}]{.mark}** at that. Is history \`always false\'?
Did the Judeocide happen or did it not? And did not some people even try
to resist it? Did slavery exist or did it not, and did not people resist
that too and, ultimately, bring it to an end? And are communities always
\`imagined\'? Or, as Sivanandan states, are they beaten out on the
smithy of a people\'s collective struggle? Furthermore, all attempts to
legislate against ideology are bound to fail because they have to adopt
\`technologies of surveillance and control identical to those used by
the state\'. Note here the Foucauldian language to set up the notion
that all \`surveillance\' is bad. But is it? No society can function
without surveillance of some kind. The point, surely, is that there
should be a public conversation about such moves and that those
responsible for implementing them be at all times accountable. To
equate, as Cohen does, a council poster about \`Stamping out racism\'
with Orwell\'s horrendous prophecy in 1984 of a boot stamping on a human
face is ludicrous and insulting. (Orwell\'s image was intensely personal
and destructive; the other is about the need to challenge not
individuals, but a collective evil.) [Cohen reveals himself to be deeply
ambivalent about punitive action against racists]{.underline}, as though
punishment or other firrm action against them (or anyone else
transgressing agreed social or legal norms) precluded \`understand-
ing\' or even help through psychotherapy. It is indeed a strange kind of
\`anti-racism\' that portrays active racists as the \`victims\', those
who are in need of \`help\'. But this is where Cohen\'s argument ends
up. **[[In their move from politics to the academy]{.mark} and the world
of \`discourse\', the [postmodernists]{.mark} may have simply [exchanged
one]{.mark} grand [narrative]{.mark}]{.underline}**, historical
materialism, **[[for]{.underline}]{.mark}** another,
**[[psychoanalysis]{.underline}]{.mark}**.62 For
[psychoanalysis]{.underline} is a grand narrative, par excellence. It is
a theory that seeks to account for the world and which [recognises few
limits on its explanatory potential]{.underline}. And [the claimed
radicalism of psycho- analysis]{.underline}, in the hands of the
postmodernists at least, [is]{.underline} not a radicalism at all but [a
prescription for a politics of quietism, fatalism and
defeat.]{.underline} **[[Those wanting to change the world]{.mark}, not
just to interpret it, [need to look elsewhere]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
